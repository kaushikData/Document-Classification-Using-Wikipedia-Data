'''Ab Imperio: Studies of New Imperial History and Nationalism in the Post-Soviet Space''' – international scientific referable journal, which developing direction “New Imperial History”, devoted to the interdisciplinary and comparative study of the history of [[nationalism]], national movements in the post-Soviet space.

== About Journal ==
The magazine adheres to an interdisciplinary editorial policy with an emphasis on history, sociology, anthropology and political science. Each issue corresponds to a strict structure. Among the permanent headings: "Methodology and Theory", "History", "Archive", "Sociology, Political Science, Ethnology", "ABC: Studies of Empire and Nationalism", "Newest Mythologies", "Historiography", "Reviews".

It is published in Russian and English (the articles are accepted in five languages: Russian, English, German, French and Ukrainian), conducts an anonymous review of articles before publication.

The magazine acts as the initiator of conferences (corresponding to the annual topics of the issues) and research projects. In the course of the work, was proposed the research program of the New Imperial History, which combines the studies of empire and nationalism, as well as studies of Western colonialism and dynastic territorially extended empires. The magazine is an associate member of [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies]], also included in the List of Scientific Journals of the Higher Attestation Commission, is indexed at RINC, ISI and Scopus.

== History ==
The magazine was founded in 1999, its’ first publication was done in June 2000 in Kazan. The idea to publish the magazine belonged to Alla Zeid, the name was suggested by Sergei Glebov. Since 2002, the articles in the magazine correspond to a pre-approved annual thematic.

In an interview with Logos Magazine Marina Mogilner and Sergei Glebov say that the preconditions for the appearance of the magazine were the lack of such quarterly scientific periodicals and the desire to study the history of the post-Soviet space through the prism of [[nationalism studies]].&lt;blockquote&gt;"The idea of a new professional historical journal arose in 1998, when it became finally clear that the main Russian historical journals -" Вопросы истории"and "Отечественная история "- could not be reformed."&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the autumn of 1999, the owner of the humanitarian holding Irina Prokhorova offered a franchise project in New York: the New Historical Review (NIO) magazine, built on principles similar to the one that later formed the basis for Ab Imperio, an international quarterly, thematic numbers, etc. .).

The proposal was accepted subject to the location of the editorial office in Moscow, under the direct control of the New Literature Review. This condition did not suit the future editors, and the project did not take place.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3947">In linguistics, an '''absolute construction''' is a [[grammatical construction]] standing apart from a normal or usual syntactical relation with other words or sentence elements. It can be a [[non-finite clause]] that is [[dependent clause|subordinate]] in form and modifies an entire sentence, an adjective or possessive pronoun standing alone without a modified [[substantive]], or a [[transitive verb]] when its object is implied but not stated.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary"&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/absolute]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="American Heritage Dictionary"&gt;American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGEL"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]] |last1=Huddleston |first1=Rodney |last2=Pullum |first2=Geoffrey K. |year=2002 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=0-521-43146-8 |pages=1265–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AHBEU"&gt;{{cite book|title=The American Heritage Book of English Usage: A Practical and Authoritative Guide to Contemporary English |year=1996 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |isbn=0-395-76785-7 |page=1 |url=http://www.bartleby.com/64/C001/001.html |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728061355/http://www.bartleby.com/64/C001/001.html |archivedate=2008-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''absolute'' derives from Latin ''absolūtum'', meaning "loosened from" or "separated".&lt;ref name="Wheelock"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Wheelock's Latin]] |last=Wheelock |first=Frederic |author2=LaFleur, Richard |edition=6th |year=2005 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York, NY |pages=155–7 |isbn=0-06-078371-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the non-finite clause, called the '''absolute clause''' (or simply the '''absolute'''), is not semantically attached to any single element in the sentence, it is easily confused with a [[dangling participle]].&lt;ref name="AHBEU"/&gt;  The difference is that the [[participial phrase]] of a dangling participle is intended to modify a particular noun, but is instead erroneously attached to a different noun, whereas a participial phrase serving as an absolute clause is not intended to modify any noun at all.

==English==
While the absolute construction is not particularly common in modern English and is generally more often seen in writing than in speech, it may be spoken as one of several fixed expressions:&lt;ref name="AHBEU"/&gt;
*''Barring bad weather'', we plan to go to the beach tomorrow.
*''All things considered'', it's not a bad idea.
*''This being the case'', let us go.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary"/&gt;
*''The referee having finally arrived'', the game began.&lt;ref name="American Heritage Dictionary"/&gt;

==Latin==
Absolute clauses appear in Latin with the modifying participle in the [[ablative case]]; for this reason they are referred to as [[ablative absolute]]s.&lt;ref name="Wheelock"/&gt;  An ablative absolute describes some general circumstance under which the action of a sentence occurs.  When translated into English, ablative absolutes are often translated as "with [noun] [participle]":
*''Urbe capta'' Aeneas fugit.&lt;br/&gt;''With the city captured'', Aeneas fled.

==Other Indo-European languages==
Absolute constructions occur with other [[grammatical case]]s in [[Indo-European languages]], such as [[accusative absolute]] in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[German language|German]] and Latin, [[genitive absolute]] in Greek, dative absolute in [[Gothic language|Gothic]] and [[Old Church Slavonic]], and locative absolute in [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=149|author=Benjamin W. Fortson IV|title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction|location=Malden, MA|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2004|isbn=1-4051-0315-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Access to public information in Europe|Access to public information]] and [[freedom of information]] (FOI) refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' [[accountability]], boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.

On 13 January 2011, the ''[[Verkhovna Rada]]'' (the Parliament of Ukraine) adopted two laws on access to information: The Law of Ukraine “On Access to Public Information”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.article19.org/data/files/pdfs/laws/ukraine-the-law-on-access-to-public-information.pdf|title=THE LAW OF UKRAINE On Access to Public Information|last=|first=|date=2011|website=article19.org|publisher=Article 19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new wording of the Law of Ukraine “On Information” (1992).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://zakon0.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2657-12|title=Law No. 2938-VI On Information|last=|first=|date=2011|website=zakon0.rada.gov.ua|publisher=Holos Ukrainy official daily|language=Ukrainian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They entered into force on May 9, 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://merlin.obs.coe.int/iris/2011/3/article30.en.html|title=Ukraine- Law on Access to Public Information Adopted|last=Shevchenko|first=Taras|date=March 2011|website=merlin.obs.coe.int|publisher=IRIS Merlin|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art. 5 of the Law of Ukraine "On Information" provides the «right for information» which includes the possibility of free collection, usage, distribution, storage and protection of information necessary for the exercise of person’s rights, freedoms and legitimate interests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ssrn.com/abstract=3158729|title=The Information Law of Ukraine|last=Kormych|first=Borys|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=Odesa|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Both of the laws were criticized in 2012 by the London-based association advocating for free expression [[Article 19]], which considered that they lack provisions to ensure that the [[Right to privacy|rights to privacy]] and [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and information are appropriately balanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/3391/en/ukraine:-data-protection-act-and-related-legislation|title=Ukraine: Data Protection Act and related legislation|last=|first=|date=July 26, 2012|website=article19.org|publisher=ARTICLE 19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2012/07/ukraine-access-data-laws-criticized-by-article-19/|title=Ukraine Access, Data Laws Criticized by Article 19|last=|first=|date=July 30, 2012|website=freedominfo.org|publisher=Freedominfo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 9, 2015, the Ukrainian Parliament approved a law to encourage government agencies to release and provide more information from the country’s archive of Soviet-era [[KGB]] files. The information would be transferred to the Institute of National Remembrance and be declassified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2015/04/ukraine-passes-open-data-bill-soviet-files-available/|title=Ukraine Passes Open Data Bill; Soviet Files Available|last=|first=|date=April 30, 2015|website=freedominfo.org|publisher=Freedominfo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ukraines-parliament-votes-open-soviet-era-kgb-archives-public-1876756|title=Ukraine’s Parliament Votes To Open Soviet-Era KGB Archives To Public|last=Lynch|first=Dennis|date=September 4, 2015|website=ibtimes.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the same law  encourages to publish free operational data, statistics and reports on government websites and on the national open data web platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.gov.ua/|title=National open data web platform|last=|first=|date=|website=data.gov.ua|language=Ukrainian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2014, the Parliament of Ukraine passed the draft law No. 0947. According to experts, it makes a variety of improvements related to access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cedem.org.ua/en/Analytics/373/|title=Centre for Democracy and Rule of Law (CEDEM)|last=|first=|date=|website=cedem.org.ua|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, fines are added for ungrounded refusals to disclose information, for an untimely or incomplete provision of information, or the provision of false information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2014/04/amendments-approved-ukrainian-access-law/|title=Amendments Approved to Ukrainian Access Law|last=|first=|date=April 18, 2014|website=freedominfo.org|publisher=Freedominfo.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Independent Reporting Mechanism]] (IRM) of the [[Open Government Partnership]] (OPG) organization &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opengovpartnership.org/irm/irm-reports|title=IRM Reports|last=|first=|date=|website=opengovpartnership.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2016, Ukraine’s progress for improving access to information, corruption prevention mechanisms, and bringing citizens in government decision making is “truly impressive”- especially considering the difficult political situation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/open-government-partnership/2016/03/21/new-report-ukraine-finds-progress-access-information|title=NEW REPORT ON UKRAINE FINDS PROGRESS IN ACCESS TO INFORMATION, BUT MORE EFFORTS ARE NEEDED IN GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY|last=|first=|date=March 21, 2016|website=opengovpartnership.org|publisher=Open Government Partnership|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the IRM,  the country fell short in delivering on promises made to improve government accountability and fight corruption. In particular, according to an expert, Ukraine needs to further open public contracting, including in publicly owned enterprises, and to bring more transparency to natural resource extraction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to IRM, also, in its next [[OPG National Plan]], Ukraine should provide for among its commitments for a system of electronic disclosure so that public officials’ assets are verifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/ukraine/irm|title=Ukraine- Progress Reports|last=|first=|date=|website=opengovpartnership.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adai''' (also '''Adaizan''', '''Adaizi''', '''Adaise''', '''Adahi''', '''Adaes''', '''Adees''', '''Atayos''') is an [[extinct language|extinct]] [[Native American language]] that was spoken in northwestern [[Louisiana]].

==Classification==
It is very poorly documented, being known only from a list of 275 words from 1804, so classification is probably impossible. It was once proposed that there may be a connection between Adai and the nearby [[Caddoan languages]], but this now seems unlikely.

The '''American Antiquarian Society''' ('''AAS'''), located in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], is both a [[learned society]] and national research library of pre-twentieth century [[American history]] and culture.  Founded in 1812, it is the oldest historical society in the United States with a national focus.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''The American Antiquarian Society, 1812–2012: A Bicentennial History'' (Worcester: American Antiquarian Society, 2012) p. x&lt;/ref&gt;  Its main building, known as Antiquarian Hall, is a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]] in recognition of this legacy.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=775&amp;ResourceType=Building&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the AAS is to collect, preserve and make available for study all printed records of what is now known as the United States of America. This includes materials from the first European settlement through the year 1876.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/mission.htm|title=Mission Statement|first=|last=aasmaster|date=March 28, 2017|publisher=|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AAS offers programs for professional scholars, pre-collegiate, undergraduate and graduate students, educators, professional artists, writers, [[genealogists]], and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/programs.htm|title=Programs &amp; Events|first=|last=aaswebsite|date=August 25, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; AAS has many digital collections available, including "A New Nation Votes: American Election Returns 1788–1824."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/digitalaas|title=Digital AAS|first=|last=aaswebsite|date=August 25, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections of the AAS contain over three million books, pamphlets, newspapers, periodicals, graphic arts materials and manuscripts. The Society is estimated to hold copies of two-thirds of the total books known to have been printed in what is now the United States from the establishment of the first press in 1640 through the year 1820; many of these volumes are exceedingly rare and a number of them are unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/tours.htm|title=Tours|first=|last=aasmaster|date=October 2, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historic materials from all fifty U.S. states, most of Canada and the [[British West Indies]] are included in the AAS repository. One of the more famous volumes held by the Society is a copy of the very first book printed in America, the [[Bay Psalm Book]].&lt;ref&gt;Gura, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  AAS also has one of the largest collections of newspapers printed in America through 1876, with more than two million issues in its collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/newspapers.htm|title=Newspapers|first=|last=aasmaster|date=October 22, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On the initiative of [[Isaiah Thomas (publisher)|Isaiah Thomas]], the AAS was founded on October 24, 1812, through an act of the [[Massachusetts General Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Gura, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; It was the third historical society established in America, and the first to be national in its scope.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt; Isaiah Thomas started the collection with approximately 8,000 books from his personal library.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The first library building was erected in 1820 in downtown [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;Gura, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, the Society moved its collections to a larger building at the corner of Highland Street, also in Worcester.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, pp. 98-99&lt;/ref&gt; This building was later abandoned and another new building was constructed.  Designed by Winslow, Bigelow &amp; Wadsworth, the Georgian Revival building was completed in 1910 and stands on the corner of Park Avenue and Salisbury Street.  There have been several additions to this building to accommodate the growing collection, the most recent of which was completed in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/development.htm|title=Development Department of the American   Antiquarian  Society|website=www.americanantiquarian.org|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AAS was presented with the 2013 National Humanities Medal by President Obama in a ceremony at the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neh.gov/news/press-release/2014-07-22|title=President Obama Awards 2013 National Humanities Medals|website=National Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of printing==
As part of AAS's mission as a learned society, it offers a variety of public lectures and seminars. One topic to which AAS dedicates significant academic energies is [[printing technology]], especially in eighteenth-century British North America. Since Isaiah Thomas was a newspaper man himself, he collected a large number of printed materials.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, pp. 14, 33&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to printing, [[papermaking|paper making]], edition setting, and reprinting, not much had changed in European technology by the eighteenth century. It was not until the late eighteenth century that paper-making material began to evolve from a hand-woven cloth to an industrial pulp. AAS undertakes special efforts to preserve printed records from this time period, as the Society maintains an on-site conservation department with various sewing, cloth, and binding materials to aid in the preservation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/conservation.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101116200509/http://americanantiquarian.org/conservation.htm |archivedate=November 16, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlin straddles the banks of the [[River Spree]], which flows into the [[River Havel]] (a [[tributary]] of the [[River Elbe]]) in the western borough of [[Spandau]]. Among the city's main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs, formed by the Spree, Havel, and [[Dahme (river)|Dahme]] rivers, the largest of which is [[Lake Müggelsee]]. Due to its location in the [[European Plain]], Berlin is influenced by a [[Temperate climate|temperate]] seasonal climate. About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals and lakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=94LP4xCb-KcC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=%22Berlin+%22+rivers+lakes+foreests+%22one+third%22#v=onepage|title=Gren Berlin|work=[[Lonely Planet]]|accessdate=9 October 2009|isbn=9781740594721|author1=Schulte-Peevers|first1=Andrea|last2=Parkinson|first2=Tom|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city lies in the [[Central German]] dialect area, the [[Berlin dialect]] being a variant of the [[Lusatian-New Marchian dialects]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Berlin|Timeline of Berlin}}

===Etymology===
Berlin lies in northeastern Germany, east of the River (Saxon or Thuringian) [[Saale]], that once constituted, together with the River [[Elbe]] (from their [[confluence]] onwards), the eastern border of the [[Francia|Frankish Realm]]. While the Frankish Realm was primarily inhabited by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes like the [[Franks]] and the [[Saxons]], the regions east of the border rivers were inhabited by [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribes. This is why most of the cities and villages in northeastern Germany bear [[Slavic languages|Slavic]]-derived names ([[Germania Slavica]]). Typical [[Germanisation|Germanised]] place name [[suffix]]es of Slavic origin are ''-ow'', ''-itz'', ''-vitz'', ''-witz'', ''-itzsch'' and ''-in'', [[prefix]]es are ''Windisch'' and ''Wendisch''. The name ''Berlin'' has its roots in the language of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] inhabitants of the area of today's Berlin, and may be related to the Old [[Polabian language|Polabian]] stem ''berl-''/''birl-'' ("swamp").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Berger|first=Dieter|title=Geographische Namen in Deutschland|publisher=Bibliographisches Institut|year=1999|isbn=978-3-411-06252-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ''Ber-'' at the beginning sounds like the German word ''Bär'' (bear), a bear appears in the coat of arms of the city. It is therefore a [[canting arms|canting arm]].

Of Berlin's [[Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin|twelve boroughs]], five bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: [[Pankow]] (the most populous),  [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Marzahn-Hellersdorf]], [[Treptow-Köpenick]] and [[Spandau]] (named Spandow until 1878). Of its ninety-six neighborhoods, twenty-two bear a (partly) Slavic-derived name: [[Altglienicke]], [[Alt-Treptow]], [[Britz]], [[Buch (Berlin)|Buch]], [[Buckow (Berlin)|Buckow]], [[Gatow]], [[Karow (Berlin)|Karow]], [[Kladow]], [[Köpenick]], [[Lankwitz]], [[Lübars]], [[Malchow (Berlin)|Malchow]], [[Marzahn]], [[Pankow (locality)|Pankow]], [[Prenzlauer Berg]], [[Rudow]], [[Schmöckwitz]], [[Spandau (locality)|Spandau]], [[Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow]], [[Steglitz]], [[Tegel]] and [[Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Zehlendorf]]. The neighborhood of [[Moabit]] bears a [[French language|French]]-derived name, and [[Französisch Buchholz]] is named after the [[Huguenots]].

In 1415, [[Frederick I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick I]] became the [[prince-elector|elector]] of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], which he ruled until 1440.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.west.net/~antipas/protected_files/news/europe/hohenzollerns.html |title=The Hohenzollern Dynasty |publisher=Antipas |year=1993 |accessdate=18 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807093738/http://www.west.net/~antipas/protected_files/news/europe/hohenzollerns.html |archivedate=7 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 15th century, his successors established Berlin-Cölln as capital of the margraviate, and subsequent members of the [[Hohenzollern]] family ruled in Berlin until 1918, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and eventually as [[German emperor]]s. In 1443, [[Frederick II, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick II Irontooth]] started the construction of a new [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|royal palace]] in the twin city Berlin-Cölln. The protests of the town citizens against the building culminated in 1448, in the "Berlin Indignation" ("Berliner Unwille").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diegeschichteberlins.de/geschichteberlins/berlinabc/stichworteag/555-berliner-unwillen.html |title=Berliner Unwillen |trans-title=Berlin unwillingness |publisher=Verein für die Geschichte Berlins e.&amp;nbsp;V.'' |first=Gerhild H.

After the royal palace was finished in 1451, it gradually came into use.

[[File:Berlin Unter den Linden Victoria Hotel um 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin became the capital of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 and expanded rapidly in the following years. (Unter den Linden in 1900)]]

Since 1618, the Margraviate of Brandenburg had been in [[personal union]] with the [[Duchy of Prussia]]. In 1701, the dual state formed the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], as [[Frederick III, Elector of Brandenburg]], crowned himself as king [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I in Prussia]]. Berlin became the capital of the new Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;Horlemann, Bernd  (Hrsg.), Mende, Hans-Jürgen (Hrsg.): Berlin 1994. Taschenkalender. Edition Luisenstadt Berlin, Nr. 01280.&lt;/ref&gt; replacing [[Königsberg]]. This was a successful attempt to centralise the capital in the very far-flung state, and it was the first time the city began to grow. In 1709, Berlin merged with the four cities of Cölln, Friedrichswerder, Friedrichstadt and Dorotheenstadt under the name Berlin, "Haupt- und Residenzstadt Berlin".&lt;ref name="Stöver2010"/&gt;

The [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed Berlin during the 19th century; the city's economy and population expanded dramatically, and it became the main railway hub and economic centre of Germany.

In the early 20th century, Berlin had become a fertile ground for the [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] movement.&lt;ref name="HollandGawthrop2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jack Holland|author2=John Gawthrop|title=The Rough Guide to Berlin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-EsJWmKCSa8C&amp;pg=PA361|year=2001|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-682-2|page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fields such as [[architecture]], [[painting]] and [[film|cinema]] new forms of artistic styles were invented. At the end of the [[First World War]] in 1918, a [[Weimar Republic|republic]] was proclaimed by [[Philipp Scheidemann]] at the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]]. In 1920, the [[Greater Berlin Act]] incorporated dozens of suburban cities, villages and estates around Berlin into an expanded city. The act increased the area of Berlin from {{convert|66|to|883|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The population almost doubled and Berlin had a population of around four million. During the [[Weimar culture|Weimar era]], Berlin underwent political unrest due to economic uncertainties, but also became a renowned centre of the [[Roaring Twenties]]. The metropolis experienced its heyday as a major world capital and was known for its leadership roles in science, technology, arts, the humanities, city planning, film, higher education, government and industries. [[Albert Einstein]] rose to public prominence during his years in Berlin, being awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1921.

In 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]] [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power#Seizure of control (1931–1933)|came to power]]. NSDAP rule diminished Berlin's Jewish community from 160,000 (one-third of all Jews in the country) to about 80,000 as a result of emigration between 1933 and 1939. After [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, thousands of the city's Jews were imprisoned in the nearby [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]]. Starting in early 1943, many were shipped to [[death camp]]s, such as [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005450|title=The Jewish Community of Berlin|publisher=Holocuast Encyclopedia |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin is the most heavily bombed city in history. During World War II, large parts of Berlin were destroyed in [[Battle of Berlin (air)|the 1943–45 air raids]] and during the [[Battle of Berlin]]. The Allies dropped 67,607 tons of bombs on the city, destroying 6,427 acres of the built up area.

The victorious powers divided the city into four sectors, analogous to the [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation zones]] into which Germany was divided. The sectors of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] (the United States, the United Kingdom and France) formed [[West Berlin]], while the [[Soviet Union|Soviet sector]] formed [[East Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpb.de/geschichte/nationalsozialismus/dossier-nationalsozialismus/39619/das-geteilte-berlin?p=all |title=Berlin – auf dem Weg zur geteilten Stadt |trans-title=Berlin – on the way to a divided city |date=27 April 2005 |first=Prof. Dr. Wolfgang |last=Benz |language=German |publisher=Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berlinermauer.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin Wall]] (painted on the western side) was a barrier that divided the city from 1961 to 1989.]]

All four [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] shared administrative responsibilities for Berlin. However, in 1948, when the Western Allies extended the currency reform in the Western zones of Germany to the three western sectors of Berlin, the [[Soviet Union]] imposed a [[Berlin Blockade|blockade]] on the access routes to and from West Berlin, which lay entirely inside Soviet-controlled territory. The [[Berlin airlift]], conducted by the three western Allies, overcame this blockade by supplying food and other supplies to the city from June 1948 to May 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.western-allies-berlin.com/historic-events/detail/airlift-blockade|title=Berlin Airlift / Blockade|publisher=Western Allies Berlin|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in [[West Germany]] and eventually included all of the American, British and French zones, excluding those three countries' zones in Berlin, while the [[Marxist-Leninist]] [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] was proclaimed in East Germany. West Berlin officially remained an occupied city, but it politically was aligned with the Federal Republic of Germany despite West Berlin's geographic isolation. Airline service to West Berlin was granted only to American, British and French airlines.

The founding of the two German states increased [[Cold War]] tensions. West Berlin was surrounded by East German territory, and East Germany proclaimed the Eastern part as its capital, a move that was not recognised by the western powers. East Berlin included most of the historic centre of the city. The West German government established itself in [[Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/berlin-im-ueberblick/geschichte/1945.en.html |title=Berlin after 1945 |publisher=BerlinOnline Stadtportal GmbH &amp; Co. KG. |accessdate=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, East Germany began the building of the [[Berlin Wall]] around West Berlin, and events escalated to a tank standoff at [[Checkpoint Charlie]]. West Berlin was now de facto a part of West Germany with a unique legal status, while East Berlin was de facto a part of East Germany. [[John F. Kennedy]] gave his "''[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]''" speech in 1963, underlining the US support for the Western part of the city. Berlin was completely divided. Although it was possible for Westerners to pass to the other side through strictly controlled checkpoints, for most Easterners travel to West Berlin or West Germany was prohibited by the government of East Germany. In 1971, a [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four-Power agreement]] guaranteed access to and from West Berlin by car or train through East Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga5-710903.htm|title=Ostpolitik: The Quadripartite Agreement of September 3, 1971 |publisher=U.S. Diplomatic Mission to Germany |year=1996 |accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, with the end of the Cold War and pressure from the East German population, the Berlin Wall fell on 9 November and was subsequently mostly demolished. Today, the [[East Side Gallery]] preserves a large portion of the wall. On 3 October 1990, the two parts of Germany were [[German reunification|reunified]] as the Federal Republic of Germany and Berlin again became the official German capital. In 1991, the German Parliament, the [[Bundestag]], [[Decision on the Capital of Germany|voted to move the seat]] of the German capital from Bonn to Berlin, which was completed in 1999. On 18 June 1994, soldiers from the United States, France and Britain marched in a parade which was part of the ceremonies to mark the final withdrawal of foreign troops allowing a [[German reunification#Reunified Berlin|reunified Berlin]].&lt;ref name=ReUnificationParade&gt;{{cite news | last = Kinzer | first = Stephan | title = Allied Soldiers March to Say Farewell to Berlin | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/19/world/allied-soldiers-march-to-say-farewell-to-berlin.html | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | location = New York City | date = 19 June 1994 | accessdate = 20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Berlin's 2001 administrative reform]] merged several districts.

===Topography===
[[File:16-07-04-Abflug-Berlin-DSC 0122.jpg|thumb|Aerial photography over central Berlin with [[Tiergarten (park)|Tiergarten]]]]

Berlin is situated in northeastern [[Germany]], in an area of low-lying marshy woodlands with a mainly flat [[topography]], part of the vast [[Northern European Plain]] which stretches all the way from northern [[France]] to western [[Russia]]. The ''Berliner Urstromtal'' (an ice age [[glacial valley]]), between the low [[Barnim Plateau]] to the north and the [[Teltow plateau|Teltow Plateau]] to the south, was formed by meltwater flowing from ice sheets at the end of the last [[Weichselian glaciation]]. The [[Spree]] follows this valley now. In Spandau, a borough in the west of Berlin, the Spree empties into the river [[Havel]], which flows from north to south through western Berlin. The course of the Havel is more like a chain of lakes, the largest being the Tegeler See and the [[Großer Wannsee]]. A series of lakes also feeds into the upper Spree, which flows through the [[Müggelsee|Großer Müggelsee]] in eastern Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5333,13.38000&amp;spn=0.060339,0.085316&amp;t=k|title=Satellite Image Berlin|publisher=[[Google Maps]]|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substantial parts of present-day Berlin extend onto the low plateaus on both sides of the Spree Valley. Large parts of the boroughs [[Reinickendorf]] and [[Pankow]] lie on the Barnim Plateau, while most of the boroughs of [[Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf]], [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]], [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]], and [[Neukölln]] lie on the Teltow Plateau.

The borough of Spandau lies partly within the Berlin Glacial Valley and partly on the Nauen Plain, which stretches to the west of Berlin. Since 2015, the highest elevation in Berlin is found on the Arkenberge hills in Pankow, at {{convert|122|m|ft|abbr=off}}. Through the dumping of construction debris, they surpassed [[Teufelsberg]] ({{convert|120.1|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), a [[Schuttberg|hill made of rubble]] from the ruins of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qiez.de/pankow/wohnen-und-leben/gruenes-berlin/der-hoechste-berg-von-berlin-liegt-nun-in-pankow-arkenberge/169588800 |title=Berlin hat eine neue Spitze |trans-title=Berlin has a new top |first=Nikolaus |last=Triantafillou |accessdate=11 November 2018 |language=German |publisher=Qiez |date=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest natural elevation is found on the [[Müggelberge]] at {{convert|114.7|m|ft|abbr=off}}, and the lowest at the Spektesee in Spandau, at {{convert|28.1|m|ft|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/bezirke/pankow/das-ist-die-hoehe-arkenberge-der-hoechste-berg-von-berlin-ist-neuerdings-in-pankow/11406254.html |title=Der höchste Berg von Berlin ist neuerdings in Pankow |trans-title=The tallest mountain in Berlin is now in Pankow |date=22 February 2015 |accessdate=22 February 2015 |work=[[Der Tagesspiegel]] |first=Stefan |last=Jacobs |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
[[File:Luftbild bln-schmoeckwitz.jpg|thumb|The outskirts of Berlin are covered with woodlands and numerous lakes.]]

Berlin has a [[Oceanic climate#Marine west coast (Cfb)|"marine west coast" (Cfb)]] climate according to the [[Köppen climate classification]] system. This type of climate features moderate summer temperatures and mild winters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=58301&amp;cityname=Berlin%2C+Berlin%2C+Germany&amp;units=|title=Berlin, Germany Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are significant continental climate influences due to its inland position, with frosts being common in winter and there being larger temperature differences between seasons than typical for many oceanic climates. Furthermore, Berlin is classified as a [[Temperate climate|temperate]] [[humid continental climate|continental climate]] (''Dc'') under the [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha climate scheme]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerstengarbe FW, Werner PC (2009) A short update on Koeppen climate shifts in Europe between 1901 and 2003. Clim Change 92: 99–107&lt;/ref&gt;

Summers are warm and sometimes humid with average high temperatures of {{convert|22|–|25|C|F}} and lows of {{convert|12|–|14|C|F}}. Winters are cool with average high temperatures of {{convert|3|C|F}} and lows of {{convert|−2|to|0|C|F}}. Spring and autumn are generally chilly to mild. Berlin's built-up area creates a microclimate, with [[urban heat island|heat stored by the city's buildings and pavement]]. Temperatures can be {{convert|4|C-change|sigfig=1}} higher in the city than in the surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/ |title=weather.com |publisher=weather.com |accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual precipitation is {{convert|570|mm|in|sp=us}} with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Snowfall mainly occurs from December through March.&lt;ref name=worldweather&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldweather.org/016/c00059.htm|title=Climate figures|website=World Weather Information Service|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cityscape===

Berlin's history has left the city with a [[wikt:polycentric|polycentric]] organization and a highly eclectic array of architecture and buildings. The city's appearance today is predominantly shaped by the key role it played in Germany's history in the 20th century. Each of the national governments based in Berlin{{snd}} the Kingdom of Prussia, the 1871 German Empire, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, East Germany, and now the reunified Germany{{snd}} initiated ambitious reconstruction programs, with each adding its own distinctive style to the city's architecture.
[[File:Sunrise Berlin 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Berlin skyline in 2014]]
Berlin was devastated by [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|bombing raids]], fires and street battles during World War II, and many of the buildings that had remained after the war were demolished in the post-war period in both West and East Berlin. Much of this demolition was initiated by municipal architecture programs to build new residential or business quarters and main roads. Many [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]] of pre-war buildings were destroyed following [[Ornament and Crime|modernist dogmas]]. While in both systems and in reunified Berlin, various important heritage monuments were also (partly) [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstructed]], including the ''Forum Fridericianum'' with e.g., the [[Berlin State Opera|State Opera]] (1955), [[Charlottenburg Palace]] (1957), the main monuments of the [[Gendarmenmarkt]] (1980s), [[Alte Kommandantur|Kommandantur]] (2003) and the project to reconstruct the baroque façades of the [[City Palace, Berlin|City Palace]]. A number of new buildings are inspired by historical predecessors or the general classical style of Berlin, such as [[Hotel Adlon]].

Clusters of [[List of tallest buildings in Berlin|high-rise buildings]] emerge at disperse locations, e.g. [[Potsdamer Platz]], [[City West]], and [[Alexanderplatz]], the latter two representing the previous centers of West and East Berlin, respectively, and the former representing the new Berlin of the 21st century built upon the previous no-man's land of the Berlin Wall. Berlin has three of the top 40 [[List of tallest buildings in Germany|tallest buildings]] in Germany.

[[File:Brandenburger Tor abends.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Brandenburg Gate]], icon of Berlin and Germany]]
The [[Fernsehturm Berlin|Fernsehturm]] (TV tower) at [[Alexanderplatz]] in [[Mitte]] is among the tallest structures in the European Union at {{convert|368|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Built in 1969, it is visible throughout most of the central districts of Berlin. The city can be viewed from its {{convert|204|m|ft|abbr=on}} high observation floor. Starting here the [[Karl-Marx-Allee]] heads east, an avenue lined by monumental residential buildings, designed in the [[Socialist Classicism]] style. Adjacent to this area is the [[Rotes Rathaus]] (City Hall), with its distinctive red-brick architecture. In front of it is the [[Neptunbrunnen]], a fountain featuring a mythological group of [[Triton (mythology)|Tritons]], [[Anthropomorphism|personifications]] of the four main Prussian rivers and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] on top of it.

The [[Brandenburg Gate]] is an iconic landmark of Berlin and Germany; it stands as a symbol of eventful European history and of unity and peace. The [[Reichstag building]] is the traditional seat of the German Parliament. It was remodelled by British architect [[Norman Foster (architect)|Norman Foster]] in the 1990s and features a glass dome over the session area, which allows free public access to the parliamentary proceedings and magnificent views of the city.

The [[East Side Gallery]] is an open-air exhibition of art painted directly on the last existing portions of the Berlin Wall. It is the largest remaining evidence of the city's historical division.
[[File:Panorama Gendarmenmarkt-Berlin-Huntke-2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gendarmenmarkt]] - on the picture: (left) [[Neue Kirche, Berlin|The New Church or "Deutscher Dom"]], (center) [[Konzerthaus Berlin]] (concert hall) and (right) [[French Cathedral, Berlin|French Cathedral]]]]
The [[Gendarmenmarkt]] is a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] square in Berlin, the name of which derives from the headquarters of the famous Gens d'armes regiment located here in the 18th century. It is bordered by two similarly designed cathedrals, the [[Französischer Dom]] with its observation platform and the [[Deutscher Dom]]. The Konzerthaus (Concert Hall), home of the Berlin Symphony Orchestra, stands between the two cathedrals.

[[File:Berlin Museumsinsel Fernsehturm.jpg|thumb|[[Bode Museum]], part of [[Museum Island]], a UNESCO World Heritage Site]]

The [[Museum Island]] in the [[River Spree]] houses [[Berlin#Museums|five museums]] built from 1830 to 1930 and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Restoration and construction of a main entrance to all museums, as well as reconstruction of the [[Stadtschloss, Berlin|Stadtschloss]] continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/newsticker/neumann--stadtschloss-wird-teurer,10917074,10924086.html |title=Neumann: Stadtschloss wird teurer |trans-title=Neumann: Palace is getting more expensive |work=[[Berliner Zeitung]] |language=German |date=24 June 2011 |accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/die-nullerjahre--nation-building---der-wiedervereinigte-staat-baut-sich-eine-neue-hauptstadt-das-pathos-der-berliner-republik,10810590,10717494.html |title=Das Pathos der Berliner Republik |trans-title=The pathos of the Berlin republic |work=[[Berliner Zeitung]] |language=German |date=19 May 2010 |accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also located on the island and adjacent to the [[Lustgarten]] and palace is [[Berlin Cathedral]], emperor William II's ambitious attempt to create a Protestant counterpart to [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. A large crypt houses the remains of some of the earlier Prussian royal family. [[St. Hedwig's Cathedral]] is Berlin's Roman Catholic cathedral.

[[File:17 20 pm (570903628).jpg|thumb|left|Potsdamer Platz, Kollhoff Tower at the center and headquarters of [[Deutsche Bahn]] to the right.]]

[[Unter den Linden]] is a tree-lined east–west avenue from the Brandenburg Gate to the site of the former Berliner Stadtschloss, and was once Berlin's premier promenade. Many Classical buildings line the street and part of [[Humboldt University]] is located there. [[Friedrichstraße]] was Berlin's legendary street during the [[Golden Twenties]]. It combines 20th-century traditions with the modern architecture of today's Berlin.
[[File:Unter den Linden Berlin2007.jpg|thumb|left|[[Unter den Linden]] boulevard with [[Zeughaus]], [[Berlin Cathedral]] and [[Fernsehturm Berlin]] at night.]]

[[Potsdamer Platz]] is an entire quarter built from scratch after 1995 after the [[Berlin Wall|Wall]] came down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baubilanz/en/potsdamer_platz.html |title=Construction and redevelopment since 1990 |publisher=Senate Department of Urban Development |accessdate=18 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610103008/http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/bauen/baubilanz/en/potsdamer_platz.html |archivedate=10 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the west of Potsdamer Platz is the Kulturforum, which houses the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]], and is flanked by the [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] and the [[Berliner Philharmonie]]. The [[Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe]], a [[Holocaust]] memorial, is situated to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/arts/design/09holo.html |title=A Forest of Pillars, Recalling the Unimaginable |work=The New York Times |accessdate=18 August 2008 |first=Nicolai |last=Ouroussoff |date=9 May 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205123448/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2005/05/09/arts/design/09holo.html |archivedate=5 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area around [[Hackescher Markt]] is home to fashionable culture, with countless clothing outlets, clubs, bars, and galleries. This includes the [[Hackesche Höfe]], a conglomeration of buildings around several courtyards, reconstructed around 1996. The nearby [[New Synagogue, Berlin|New Synagogue]] is the center of Jewish culture.

[[File:Le château de Charlottenburg (Berlin) (6340508573).jpg|thumb|[[Charlottenburg Palace]] is the largest existing palace in Berlin.]]

The [[Straße des 17. Juni]], connecting the Brandenburg Gate and Ernst-Reuter-Platz, serves as the central east-west axis. Its name commemorates the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|uprisings in East Berlin of 17 June 1953]]. Approximately halfway from the Brandenburg Gate is the Großer Stern, a circular traffic island on which the [[Siegessäule]] (Victory Column) is situated. This monument, built to commemorate Prussia's victories, was relocated in 1938–39 from its previous position in front of the Reichstag.

The [[Kurfürstendamm]] is home to some of Berlin's luxurious stores with the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church]] at its eastern end on [[Breitscheidplatz]]. The church was destroyed in the Second World War and left in ruins. Nearby on Tauentzienstraße is [[KaDeWe]], claimed to be continental Europe's largest department store. The [[Rathaus Schöneberg]], where [[John F. Kennedy]] made his famous "[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]!" speech, is situated in [[Tempelhof-Schöneberg]].

West of the center, [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]] is the residence of the German President. [[Charlottenburg Palace]], which was burnt out in the Second World War, is the largest historical palace in Berlin.

[[File:StadtschlossBerlinL1130213_(2).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Humboldt Forum]] is a large-scale museum project, which will have its seat in the reconstructed [[Berlin Palace]]. The palace is currently being rebuilt, with completion expected in 2019. Reconstruction under way, 2018.]]
[[File:Le projet Humboldt-Forum (Berlin) (6087765939).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Model of how the finished reconstruction of [[Humboldt Forum]] will look]].

The [[Funkturm Berlin]] is a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lattice radio tower in the fairground area, built between 1924 and 1926. It is the only observation tower which stands on insulators and has a restaurant {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} and an observation deck {{convert|126|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground, which is reachable by a windowed elevator.

The [[Oberbaumbrücke]] is Berlin's most iconic bridge, crossing the [[Spree|River Spree]]. It was a former East-West border crossing and connects the boroughs of [[Friedrichshain]] and [[Kreuzberg]]. It was completed in a [[brick gothic]] style in 1896. The center portion has been reconstructed with a steel frame after having been destroyed in 1945. The bridge has an upper deck for the [[Berlin U-Bahn]] line {{BVG lines|U1}}.

National and international migration into the city has a long history. In 1685, following the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France, the city responded with the [[Edict of Potsdam]], which guaranteed religious freedom and tax-free status to French Huguenot refugees for ten years. The [[Greater Berlin Act]] in 1920 incorporated many suburbs and surrounding cities of Berlin. It formed most of the territory that comprises modern Berlin and increased the population from 1.9&amp;nbsp;million to 4&amp;nbsp;million.

Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Currently, Berlin is home to at least 178,000 [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and [[Turks in Germany|Turkish German]] residents,&lt;ref name="pop-detail"/&gt; making it the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey. In the 1990s the ''Aussiedlergesetze'' enabled immigration to Germany of some residents from the former [[Soviet Union]]. Today ethnic [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|Germans]] from countries of the former Soviet Union make up the largest portion of the Russian-speaking community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dmitry Bulgakov |url=http://www.russiajournal.com/node/4653 |title=Berlin is speaking Russians' language |publisher=Russiajournal.com |date=11 March 2001 |accessdate=10 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406142034/http://www.russiajournal.com/node/4653 |archivedate=6 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last decade experienced an influx from various Western countries and some African regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/print-wams/article616463/Berlin_wird_farbiger_Die_Afrikaner_kommen.html |title=Berlin wird farbiger.

===Languages===
{{Main|German language|Berlinerisch dialect}}
[[German language|German]] is the official and predominant spoken language in Berlin. It is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] that derives most of its vocabulary from the Germanic branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. German is one of 24 languages of the European Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/languages/policy/linguistic-diversity/official-languages-eu_en.htm |title=Official Languages |author=European Commission |accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the three [[working language]]s of the [[European Commission]].

Berlinerisch or Berlinisch is not a dialect linguistically, but has features of [[Lausitzisch-neumärkisch dialects]]. It is spoken in Berlin and the [[Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region|surrounding metropolitan area]]. It originates from a [[Mark Brandenburgish dialects|Mark Brandenburgish]] variant.  The dialect is now seen more as a [[sociolect]], largely through increased immigration and trends among the educated population to speak [[standard German]] in everyday life.

The most-commonly-spoken foreign languages in Berlin are Turkish, English, Russian, Arabic, Polish, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian, Italian, Vietnamese, and French. Turkish, Arabic, Kurdish, Serbo-Croatian are heard more often in the western part, due to the large Middle Eastern and former-Yugoslavian communities. English, Vietnamese, Russian, and Polish have more native speakers in East Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/wirtschaft/article1309952/Zwei-Millionen-Berliner-sprechen-mindestens-zwei-Sprachen.html |title=Studie – Zwei Millionen Berliner sprechen mindestens zwei Sprachen – Wirtschaft – Berliner Morgenpost – Berlin |publisher=Morgenpost.de |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City state===
[[File:Berlin Rotes rathaus.jpg|thumb|[[Rotes Rathaus]] (''Red City Hall''), seat of the Senate and Mayor of Berlin]]

Since [[German reunification|the reunification]] on 3 October 1990, Berlin has been one of the three [[States of Germany#Subdivisions|city states in Germany]] among the present 16 states of Germany. The [[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin|House of Representatives]] (''Abgeordnetenhaus'') functions as the city and state parliament, which currently has 141 seats. Berlin's executive body is the [[Senate of Berlin]] (''Senat von Berlin''). The Senate consists of the [[List of mayors of Berlin|Governing Mayor]] (''Regierender Bürgermeister'') and up to eight senators holding ministerial positions, one of them holding the title of "Mayor" (''Bürgermeister'') as deputy to the Governing Mayor. The total annual state budget of Berlin in 2015 exceeded €24.5 ($30.0) billion including a budget surplus of €205 ($240) million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/berliner-haushalt-finanzsenator-bleibt-trotz-sprudelnder-steuereinnahmen-vorsichtig-24702234|title=Berliner Haushalt Finanzsenator bleibt trotz sprudelnder Steuereinnahmen vorsichtig |work=Berliner Zeitung |accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) and [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (Die Linke) took control of the city government after the [[Berlin state election, 2001|2001 state election]] and won another term in the [[Berlin state election, 2006|2006 state election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik-berlin.de/produkte/Faltblatt_Brochure/berlin_in_Zahlen_engl.pdf |title=Berlin state election, 2006 |website=Der Landeswahlleiter für Berlin |accessdate=17 August 2008 |language=German |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323161037/https://www.statistik-berlin.de/produkte/Faltblatt_Brochure/berlin_in_Zahlen_engl.pdf |archivedate=23 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Berlin state election, 2016|2016 state election]], there has been a coalition between the Social Democratic Party, the Greens and the Left Party.

The Governing Mayor is simultaneously Lord Mayor of the City of Berlin (''Oberbürgermeister der Stadt'') and Minister President of the Federal State of Berlin (''Ministerpräsident des Bundeslandes''). The office of the Governing Mayor is located in the [[Rotes Rathaus|Rotes Rathaus (Red City Hall)]]. Since 2014 this office has been held by [[Michael Müller (politician)|Michael Müller]] of the Social Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2051103,00.html|title=The Glamor Guy|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time Europe]]|date=8 May 2005|accessdate=17 August 2008}} See also: {{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/23/world/europe/23wowereit.html|title=Berlin Mayor, Symbol of Openness, Has National Appeal|work=The New York Times|accessdate=17 August 2008|first=Mark|last=Landler|date=23 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boroughs===
{{Main|Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin}}
[[File:Berlin Subdivisions.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Boroughs and neighborhoods of Berlin|Berlin's twelve boroughs and their 96 neighborhoods]] ]]

Berlin is subdivided into 12 boroughs or districts (''Bezirke''). Each borough is made up by a number of subdistricts or neighborhoods (''Ortsteile''), which have historic roots in much older municipalities that predate the formation of Greater Berlin on 1 October 1920. These subdistricts became urbanized and incorporated into the city later on. Many residents strongly identify with their neighbourhoods, colloquially called ''[[Kiez]]''. At present, Berlin consists of 96 subdistricts, which are commonly made up of several smaller residential areas or quarters.

Each borough is governed by a borough council (''Bezirksamt'') consisting of five councilors (''Bezirksstadträte'') including the borough's mayor (''Bezirksbürgermeister''). The council is elected by the borough assembly (''Bezirksverordnetenversammlung''). However, the individual boroughs are not independent municipalities, but subordinate to the Senate of Berlin. &lt;!-- ([[urban district]], ''Stadtkreis'') --&gt; The borough's mayors make up the council of mayors (''Rat der Bürgermeister''), which is led by the city's Governing Mayor and advises the Senate. The neighborhoods have no local government bodies.

===Twin towns – sister cities===
{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}

Berlin maintains official partnerships with 17 cities.&lt;ref name=Berlinsistercities&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/rbmskzl/en/international-relations/city-partnerships/ |title=City Partnerships |type=official web site |publisher=Governing Mayor of Berlin, Senate Chancellery, Directorate for Protocol and International Relations |website=Berlin.de |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twin towns and sister cities|Town twinning]] between Berlin and other cities began with its sister city Los Angeles in 1967. East Berlin's partnerships were canceled at the time of German reunification but later partially reestablished. West Berlin's partnerships had previously been restricted to the borough level. During the Cold War era, the partnerships had reflected the different power blocs, with West Berlin partnering with capitals in the Western World, and East Berlin mostly partnering with cities from the [[Warsaw Pact]] and its allies.

There are several joint projects with many other cities, such as [[Beirut]], [[Belgrade]], [[São Paulo]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Helsinki]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Mumbai]], [[Oslo]], [[Shanghai]], [[Seoul]], [[Sofia]], [[Sydney]], [[New York City]] and [[Vienna]]. Berlin participates in international city associations such as the Union of the Capitals of the European Union, Eurocities, Network of European Cities of Culture, Metropolis, Summit Conference of the World's Major Cities, and Conference of the World's Capital Cities. Berlin's official sister cities are:&lt;ref name=Berlinsistercities/&gt;

===Energy===
[[File:Berlin-mitte heizkraftwerk-mitte 20060605 629.jpg|thumb|Power plant Heizkraftwerk Mitte]]

Berlin's two largest energy provider for private households are the Swedish firm [[Vattenfall]] and the Berlin-based company [[GASAG]]. Both offer electric power and natural gas supply. Some of the city's electric energy is imported from nearby power plants in southern [[Brandenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/berlin.pdf|title=European Green City Index Berlin Germany|website=Siemens|date=2009|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2015}} the five [[List of power stations in Germany|largest power plants measured by capacity]] are the Heizkraftwerk Reuter West, the Heizkraftwerk Lichterfelde, the Heizkraftwerk Mitte, the Heizkraftwerk Wilmersdorf, and the Heizkraftwerk Charlottenburg. All of these [[power station]]s generate [[electricity generation|electricity]] and [[Heat|useful heat]] at the same time to facilitate buffering during load peaks.

In 1993 the power grid connections in the Berlin-Brandenburg capital region were renewed. In most of the inner districts of Berlin power lines are underground cables; only a 380&amp;nbsp;kV and a 110&amp;nbsp;kV line, which run from Reuter substation to the urban [[Autobahn]], use overhead lines. The [[Berlin 380-kV electric line]] is the backbone of the city's energy grid.

Berlin has a long history of discoveries in medicine and innovations in medical technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/magazin/wissen/Elitewettbewerb-Universitaeten;art304,2400973|title=Berlin leuchtet|first1=Anja|last1=Kühne|first2=Tilmann|last2=Warnecke|website=[[Der Tagesspiegel]]|date=17 October 2007|accessdate=18 December 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern history of medicine has been significantly influenced by scientists from Berlin. [[Rudolf Virchow]] was the founder of cellular pathology, while [[Robert Koch]] developed vaccines for anthrax, cholera, and tuberculosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charite.de/en/the_charite/about_us/history/|title=History of the Charité of Berlin|website=[[Charité]]|date= 2015|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Charité]] complex (Universitätsklinik Charité) is the largest [[university hospital]] in Europe, tracing back its origins to the year 1710. The Charité is spread over four sites and comprises 3,300 beds, around 14,000 staff, 7,000 students, and more than 60 operating theaters, and it has a turnover of over one billion euros annually. The [[Charité]] is a joint institution of the [[Free University of Berlin|Freie Universität Berlin]] and the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], including a wide range of institutes and specialized medical centers.

Among them are the German Heart Center, one of the most renowned transplantation centers, the Max-Delbrück-Center for Molecular Medicine and the Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Genetics. The scientific research at these institutions is complemented by many research departments of companies such as Siemens and Bayer. The [[World Health Summit]] and several international health related conventions are held annually in Berlin.

===Nightlife and festivals===
[[File:Festival of Lights 2012 - Französischer Dom.jpg|thumb|right|[[French Cathedral, Berlin|French Cathedral]] during the annual [[Festival of Lights (Berlin)|Festival of Lights]] ]]

Berlin's nightlife has been celebrated as one of the most diverse and vibrant of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=6949|title=Losing your mind in Berlin|first=Walter|last=Wasacz|website=[[Metro Times]]|date=11 October 2004|accessdate=18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 80s the [[SO36]] in [[Kreuzberg]] was a centre for [[punk music]] and culture. The ''SOUND'' and the ''Dschungel'' gained notoriety. Throughout the 1990s, people in their 20s from all over the world, particularly those in [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]], made Berlin's club scene a premier nightlife venue. After the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989, many historic buildings in Mitte, the former city centre of East Berlin, were illegally occupied and re-built by young squatters and became a fertile ground for underground and [[counterculture]] gatherings. The central boroughs are home to many nightclubs, including the Watergate, [[Tresor (club)|Tresor]] and [[Berghain]]. The [[KitKatClub]] and several other locations are known for their sexually uninhibited parties.

Clubs are not required to close at a fixed time during the weekends, and many parties last well into the morning, or even all weekend. The ''Berghain'' features the well-known ''Panorama Bar'', a bar that opens its shades at daybreak, allowing party-goers a panorama view of Berlin after dancing through the night. The ''Weekend Club'' near [[Alexanderplatz]] features a roof terrace that allows partying at night. Several venues have become a popular stage for the [[Neo-Burlesque]] scene.

[[File:In Berghain.jpg|thumb|left|[[Berghain]] nightclub]]

Berlin has a long history of gay culture, and is an important [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee|birthplace of the LGBT rights movement]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8362">[[File:Big Johnson with E. Normus headshot.jpg|thumb|[[E. Normus Johnson]] on a Big Johnson [[t-shirt]]]]
'''Big Johnson''' is a brand that is marketed by Maryland Brand Management, Inc. (MBM), known for its [[T-shirts]] featuring [[E. Normus Johnson]] depicted in comic art featuring sexual innuendos. MBM is the successor company to Maryland Screen Printers Inc. (MSP) and G &amp; C Sales, Inc. At the height of Big Johnson's success in the 1990s, it sponsored a Big Johnson [[NASCAR]] automobile and MSP was twice listed in the ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]'' list of America's fastest growing companies. The sexual innuendo has been controversial leading to court rulings banning sales in federal buildings and corporate decisions banning wearing the shirts.

==History==
In 1986, Garrett and Craig Pfeifer created G &amp; C Sales to create and market apparel relying on suppliers. The explosive growth of the company which surpassed the capabilities of the company's suppliers led to the formation of MSP in 1988, which gave the brothers control of their own production.&lt;ref name=MBMI/&gt; MSP was named to ''Inc.'''s List of Americas fastest growing companies in both 1993 and 1994.&lt;ref name=MO/&gt; Big Johnson T-shirts and apparel are by far the most famous product of MBM.&lt;ref name=MO&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419101458/http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=13668|archivedate=2008-04-19|url=http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=13668|title=Members Only: Local T-shirt Mogul Garrett Pfeifer Discusses His Big Johnson|accessdate=2010-08-30|date=2007-05-23|work=[[Baltimore City Paper]]|author=Harvell, Jess}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brand peaked in the 1990s, with 1992 sales of $6.5 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|6.5|1992|r=1}}}} million today); 1994 sales of $16.5 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|16.5|1994|r=1}}}} million) and 1996 sales reaching $20 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|20|1996|r=1}}}} million).&lt;ref name=MO/&gt;&lt;ref name=BJTbENstb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-05-11/features/1995131002_1_pfeifer-johnson-t-shirts-fish-shirts|title=Big Johnson T-shirts bring E. Normus success to brothers|accessdate=2010-09-01|date=1995-05-11|work=[[Baltimore Sun]]|author=Alvarez, Rafael}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sales were on shirts that wholesaled for $7.50.&lt;ref name=BJTbENstb/&gt; At that time, the company sponsored the Big Johnson NASCAR race car of [[Dick Trickle]].&lt;ref name=MO/&gt; For a time, the company also sponsored the Busch [[Grand National Series]] NASCAR driver [[Johnny Rumley]].&lt;ref name=BJTbENstb/&gt; In 1995, the Big Johnson [[fan club]] had 13,000 members.&lt;ref name=BJTbENstb/&gt; In 2006, Garrett Pfeifer created Maryland Brand Management, Inc.&lt;ref name=MBMI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdbrand.com/company.html|title=Maryland Brand Management, Inc.|accessdate=2010-08-30|publisher=Maryland Brand Management, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that period Big Johnson accounted for 60% of MSP's sales and profits doubled every year from 1990 to 1994.&lt;ref name=BJTbENstb/&gt; In 2009, MBM celebrated 20 years of Big Johnson apparel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdbrand.com/BJCATALOG2010.pdf |title=Big Johnson 2010 Catalog |publisher=Maryland Brand Management, Inc. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714063544/http://www.mdbrand.com/BJCATALOG2010.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the company's products became part of a [[United States Constitution]] [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] case when a [[gift shop]] proprietor at the [[National Fire Academy]] in [[Emmitsburg, Maryland|Emmitsburg]], Maryland was forced by a [[U.S. District Court]] ruling to take sexually suggestive T-shirts and cards out of his store, which was located in a federal building. The order noted that "The sale . . . of items which denote sexually offensive and discriminatory statements, depictions or pictures is in violation of federal law and presents a hostile and sexually offensive environment". The proprietor sought an [[injunction]] against the [[U.S. Fire Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-05-20/news/1995140044_1_morris-nickerson-firefighters|title=Fire school gift shop in hot water|accessdate=2010-08-30|date=1995-05-20|work=[[Baltimore Sun]]|author=James, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months after the ruling, the case was settled with the gift shop being granted expanded space in exchange for surrendering the right to sell the offending materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-10-18/news/1995291148_1_johnson-t-shirts-morris-fire-academy|title=Suggestive T-shirts won't be sold Fire academy store will get more space under settlement HHTC|accessdate=2010-08-30|date=1995-10-18|work=[[Baltimore Sun]]|author=James, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both [[Disney World]] and [[Kings Dominion]], are both large customers of MBM, Big Johnson shirts are banned in their [[amusement park]]s.&lt;ref name=MO/&gt; Big Johnson has expanded beyond E. Normus Johnson shirts with lines of shirts for firefighters, police, and bikers.&lt;ref name=MO/&gt;

In 2014, the Big Johnson brand was licensed to Seaboard Traders of South Carolina under the brand BigJohnsonClassics.com. Through the BigJohnsonClassics.com website, new designs are being added, and the original designs are being recreated, based on customer demand.

==E. Normus Johnson==
[[File:Big Johnson with E. Normus headshot.jpg|thumb|Johnson on a Big Johnson [[t-shirt]]]]
'''E. Normus Johnson''' is fictional character who is the subject (and thus the voice) of Big Johnson [[T-shirt]]s. Each shirt has a caption and image that plays on the [[phallic]] slang meaning of the term Johnson using [[double entendre]]s. E. Normus is always the main character of the image.

E. Normus Johnson is depicted as a scrawny, freckle-faced, bespectacled, red-haired [[geek]].&lt;ref name=MO/&gt; He is described as "a geekier version of ''[[MAD magazine]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Alfred E. Neuman]]" by [[brandchannel]].&lt;ref name=BJnm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandchannel.com/features_profile.asp?pr_id=370|title=Big Johnson: no mojo?|accessdate=2010-08-16|date=2008-01-21|publisher=[[brandchannel]]|author=Sauer, Abram|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204164900/http://www.brandchannel.com/features_profile.asp?pr_id=370|archivedate=2008-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his nerdiness and his unconfirmed claims of gargantuan physical endowment.&lt;ref name=BJTbENstb/&gt; Created in 1988 or 1989, depending on the source, he had appeared in 120 cartoon depictions by [[novelty t-shirt]] designers Maryland Screenprinters in their primary [[business line]] of Big Johnson T-shirts by 1995.&lt;ref name=MO/&gt;&lt;ref name=BJTbENstb/&gt; In 2009, MBM celebrated 20 years of Big Johnson apparel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdbrand.com/BJCATALOG2010.pdf |title=Big Johnson 2010 Catalog |publisher=Maryland Brand Management, Inc. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714063544/http://www.mdbrand.com/BJCATALOG2010.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoons are all juvenile humor that allude to male [[genitalia]] without ever mentioning it by using the double entendre of the Big Johnson name. Using no nudity most t-shirts depict the mascot with a [[Photo caption|caption]] containing a clever [[pun]].&lt;ref name=BJnm/&gt; Most of the comic art includes buxom adoring women accompanying E. Normus.&lt;ref name=BJTbENstb/&gt; Examples of the puns accompanying artistic depictions of E.Normus are "Big Johnson Fire Department: Break out your hose and pumper", "Big Johnson Fishing Gear: She’ll be ready to bite as soon as your fly drops", "Big Johnson Bar and Casino: Liquor up front. Poker in the rear", and "Big Johnson Tattoo Parlor: You’re going to feel more than a little prick".&lt;ref name=BJnm/&gt; Johnson is the work of Maryland Screenprinters' artist Al Via.&lt;ref name=BJnm/&gt; The common themes of the captions depict the [[target market]] as firefighters, NASCAR fanatics, hunters, anglers, car buffs and, apparently, Southerners.&lt;ref name=BJnm/&gt;

The '''conservation and restoration of flags and banners''' is the process by which conservators work to [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preserve]] and restore flags and banners from future deterioration and damage. As a part of [[Conservation and restoration of textiles|Conservation of Textiles]], flag and banner conservation require the care of a skilled and well trained textile conservator, specifically trained in historical materials.

==Material identification==
Historical Flags are often made of [[silk]], [[cotton]], [[linen]], or thin [[wool]] bunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flags and Banners|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/flags-and-banners.html|website=Museum Textile Services., LLC.|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These materials were used in the making of flags, primarily in the U.S. until the mid 20th century. Forensic examination of flags, to the level of examining the fibers of the fabrics themselves, and the threads used to sew the flags, helps identify the period of the materials used and usually is a good indicator of the period of a flag (though not necessarily, in the case of a forgery).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Protein Fibers|url=http://www.textileschool.com/articles/77/natural-protein-fibers|website=The Textile School|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These materials can be very fragile and require advanced conservation techniques. Conservators are experts in stabilization and preservation of historic fabrics, flags may be in a variety of conditions from good condition to tattered fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin's Civil War Battle Flags: From the Collections of the Wisconsin Veteran's Museum|url=http://www.wisconsinbattleflags.com/conservation/|website=Wisconsin Battle Flags.com|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silk and wool are protein fibers whereas cotton and linen are vegetable fibers. The process by which they deteriorate will vary greatly and needs to be carefully addressed during conservation and preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cellulosic Fibers|url=http://www.textileschool.com/articles/70/natural-cellulose-fibres-natures-own-fibres|website=The Textile School|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nowadays many flags are made of a synthetic blend or [[nylon]] materials, which have their own unique requirements for preservation and care.

== Common causes of damage ==
Flag condition often relates to their usage during the war, so some of the most historically significant examples show the greatest damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin's Civil War Battle Flags: From the Collections of the Wisconsin Veteran's Museum|url=http://www.wisconsinbattleflags.com/conservation/|website=Wisconsin Battle Flags.com|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, flags were not limited to damage from war, such as bullet holes or blood stains - which have specific treatments themselves - but also damage from natural elements such as wind, light exposure, temperature, humidity and pest infestation.
*[[Wind]] damage: The mechanical action of wind forces and exposure to environmental effects can cause damage to the filament and is characterized by splitting. Visual characteristics of wind damage include fraying and even shredding in high winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hearle|first1=JWS|last2=Lomas|first2=B.|last3=Cooke|first3=W.D.|title=Atlas of Fibre Fracture and Damage to Textiles|date=1998|publisher=Elsevier|page=360|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*
*[[Light]] Exposure: Too much light speeds deterioration of textiles. Historic textiles, such as flags and banners should be protected from excessive light levels, and especially from sunlight and fluorescent light, which contain high amounts of ultraviolet radiation - which is the most harmful form of light. Signs of Light damage can include a brittleness of the material, overall color change of the fabric or yellowing/ browning of the textile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation Concerns|publisher=Cooper Hewitt- Smithsonian|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9781560981749|page=85}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*
*[[Temperature]] and [[Humidity]] Fluctuations: Both mechanisms of decay for objects can be attributed to either too low or too high of a temperature, too high of humidity, or too much fluctuation between temperatures or humidity levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|date=2010|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780838911228|page=378|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pest (organism)|Pests]]: There are many types of pests, from [[insects]] to small [[mammals]] such as [[rodents]] that can infest an organic collection of all types. In particular, these pests can colonize textiles and cause irreparable damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|date=2010|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780838911228|page=376|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of the types of pests that can afflict historical flags and banners include cloth [[moths]] and [[carpet beetles]]. It is important to be vigilant of possible signs of infestation and to take preemptive measures to ensure infestation and damage does not occur. Professionals charged with the care and preservation of collections work to develop and enforce Integrated Pest Management plans (IPM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|date=2010|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-8389-1122-8|page=297|edition=fifth}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure proper steps are taken to protect historic items such as flags and banners.

== Common treatments and handling ==
* Cleaning- While many people have experience cleaning everyday textiles, cleaning historical textiles is different. Conservators approach cleaning historic textiles like flags and banner very carefully as each cleaning process can create a little damage. They must weigh the pros and cons of each method carefully before proceeding. Damage such as dyes bleeding, seams shrinking or finishes being lost can occur in the cleaning process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landry|first1=Gregory|last2=et.al.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|date=2000|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data|location=Singapore|isbn=9780912724522|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vacuuming - also referred to as surface cleaning. This method is employed by conservators when trying to remove surface dirt. Carefully vacuuming the textile on a low suction, conservators will sometimes used a screen to prevent individual fibers from getting sucked up and lost in the vacuum. This method is considered least invasive and often very successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landry|first1=Gregory|last2=et.al.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|date=2000|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data|location=Singapore|isbn=9780912724522|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wet cleaning- or washing is a more invasive cleaning method, and one that conservators may be hesitant to use without proper review of the textile. Wet cleaning, or washing is an irreversible process, and can cause significant damage. In particular, commercial detergents and other chemicals can increase the rate of deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landry|first1=Gregory|last2=et.al.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|date=2000|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data|location=Singapore|isbn=9780912724522|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pest Control-Prevention is better than cure. In order to develop and implement an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy it is important understand and recognize some of the key components of successful pest control. 
#Avoid pests- Keep the area clean a clear of clutter and inspect often.
#Prevent pest colonization- follow routine pest management.

If pest infestation occurs it is important to act fast by following the IPM plan and consulting a trusted pest control professional. If individual pieces are attacked it is important to isolate them immediately in a plastic bag or sealed between to sheets of plastic and tape and then proceed with the IPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landry|first1=Gregory|last2=et.al.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|date=2000|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data|location=Singapore|isbn=9780912724522|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Recognize pests- what kind of infestation do you have?
#Assess the pest problem- how pervasive is the problem?
#Solve the pest problem- follow the IPM and consult a pest control professional
#Review IMP procedure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flags and Banners|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/flags-and-banners.html|website=Museum Textile Services., LLC.|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage ==
It is important to consider proper textile storage in the design plan of your storage facility. This room should have limited access, in the interior of the building, with no exposure to outside light, temperature controlled, and properly installed monitoring equipment. Like other organic materials, textiles can deteriorate very quickly under fluctuating temperatures and humidity levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bachmann|first1=Konstanze|title=Conservation Concerns|date=1992|publisher=Smithsonian Books|isbn=978-1-56098-174-9|pages=69–96}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Flags and banner are no exception to this so proper storage is critical in preservation.
* Flat Storage-Flat storage mats are constructed of corrugated cardboard with a window opening that should be slightly large than the textile object. Textiles should be wrapped in neutral pH tissue. This flat mats can then be stored in flat acid free boxes.
* Rolled Storage- Flat textiles that are in good condition and in good strength can be rolled up and stored in tubes. The length of the textile tube is determined by the width of the textile. Textiles should be inter-leafed by neutral pH tissue paper and the textile secured in the tube. Textile tubes should then be stored in flat boxes made of acid free corrugated cardboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bachmann|first1=Konstanze|title=Conservation Concerns|date=1992|publisher=Cooper Hewitt- Smithsonian|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9781560981749|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mounted Storage- historic flags and banners are also mounted for display and storage. It is important to keep in mind the condition of the flag prior to placing it in mounted storage.

[[File:Bekker 1831 page184.jpg|thumb|236px&lt;!--(approx Sidebar/Infobox)--&gt;|The end of ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'' and beginning of ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' on page 184 of [[August Immanuel Bekker|Bekker]]'s 1831 edition.]]

The '''Corpus Aristotelicum''' is the collection of [[Aristotle]]'s works that have survived from antiquity through [[Transmission of the Greek Classics|medieval manuscript transmission]]. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle's school. Reference to them is made according to the organization of [[August Immanuel Bekker|Immanuel Bekker]]'s nineteenth-century edition, which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.

== Overview of the extant works ==

The extant works of Aristotle are broken down according to the five categories in the Corpus Aristotelicum.  Not all of these works are considered genuine, but differ with respect to their connection to Aristotle, his associates and his views. Some are regarded by most scholars as products of Aristotle's "school" and compiled under his direction or supervision. (The ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'', the only major modern addition to the Corpus Aristotelicum, has also been so regarded.) Other works, such as ''On Colors'', may have been products of Aristotle's successors at the Lyceum, e.g., [[Theophrastus]] and [[Strato of Lampsacus]]. Still others acquired Aristotle's name through similarities in doctrine or content, such as the ''De Plantis,'' possibly by [[Nicolaus of Damascus]]. A final category, omitted here, includes medieval [[palmistry|palmistries]], [[astrological]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] texts whose connection to Aristotle is purely fanciful and self-promotional.

In several of the treatises, there are references to other works in the corpus.  Based on such references, some scholars have suggested a possible chronological order for a number of Aristotle's writings.  [[W.D. Ross]], for instance, suggested the following broad chronology (which of course leaves out much):  ''Categories'', ''Topics'', ''Sophistici Elenchi'', ''Analytics'', ''Metaphysics Δ'', the physical works, the ''Ethics'', and the rest of the ''Metaphysics''.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. D. Ross]], ''Aristotle's Metaphysics'' (1953), vol. 1, p. lxxxii.  By the "physical works", Ross means the ''Physics'', ''On the Heavens'', ''On Generation and Corruption'', and the ''Meteorology''; see Ross, ''Aristotle's Physics'' (1936), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many modern scholars, however, based simply on lack of evidence, are skeptical of such attempts to determine the chronological order of Aristotle's writings.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{harvnb|Barnes|1995|pp=18–22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exoteric and esoteric===
{{See also|Aristotle#Loss and preservation}}
According to a distinction that originates with Aristotle himself, his writings are divisible into two groups: the "[[exoteric]]" and the "[[esoteric]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barnes|1995|p=12}}; Aristotle himself: ''Nicomachean Ethics'' 1102a26–27. Aristotle himself never uses the term "esoteric" or "acroamatic". For other passages where Aristotle speaks of ''exōterikoi logoi'', see [[W. D. Ross]], ''Aristotle's Metaphysics'' (1953), vol. 2, pp. 408–410. Ross defends an interpretation according to which the phrase, at least in Aristotle's own works, usually refers generally to "discussions not peculiar to the [[Peripatetic school]]", rather than to specific works of Aristotle's own.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works Aristotle intended for the public (exoteric), and the more technical works intended for use within the [[Lyceum]] course / school (esoteric).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=House |first=Humphry |url=https://archive.org/details/aristotlespoetic032945mbp|page=35|title=Aristotles Poetics|year=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be Aristotle's own (unpolished) lecture notes (or in some cases possible notes by his students).{{sfn|Barnes|1995|p=12}} However, one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation. The 5th century [[neoplatonist]] [[Ammonius Hermiae]] writes that Aristotle's writing style is deliberately [[Obscurantism|obscurantist]] so that "good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more, whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ammonius | year= 1991 | title= On Aristotle's Categories | location= Ithaca, NY | publisher= Cornell University Press | isbn= 0-8014-2688-X }} p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bekker numbers ==
{{See also|Bekker numbering}}
'''Bekker numbers''', the standard form of reference to works in the Corpus Aristotelicum, are based on the page numbers used in the Prussian Academy of Sciences edition of the complete works of [[Aristotle]] (''Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica'', Berlin, 1831–1870).  They take their name from the editor of that edition, the classical [[philology|philologist]] [[August Immanuel Bekker]] (1785–1871).

== Aristotle's works by Bekker numbers ==

The following list gives the Bekker numbers that are used to give references to Aristotle's works; all of Aristotle's works are listed, except for the ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'', which was discovered after Bekker's edition was published, and the fragments.

The titles are given in accordance with the standard set by the Revised Oxford Translation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Aristotle'', edited by [[Jonathan Barnes]], 2 vols., Princeton University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin titles, still often used by scholars, are also given.

{{Corpus Aristotelicum table}}

== Aristotelian works lacking Bekker numbers ==

===''Constitution of the Athenians''===
The ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'' (Greek, ''Athenaiōn Politeia''; Latin, ''Atheniensium Respublica'') was not included in Bekker's edition because it was first edited in 1891 from papyrus rolls acquired in 1890 by the [[British Museum]].  The standard reference to it is by section (and subsection) numbers.

===Fragments&lt;!--linked from 'Valentin Rose (classicist)'--&gt;===
Surviving fragments of the many lost works of Aristotle were included in the fifth volume of Bekker's edition, edited by [[Valentin Rose (classicist)|Valentin Rose]].  These are not cited by Bekker numbers, however, but according to fragment numbers. Rose's first edition of the fragments of [[Aristotle]] was ''Aristoteles Pseudepigraphus'' (1863).  As the title suggests, Rose considered these all to be spurious. The numeration of the fragments in a revised edition by Rose, published in the [[Teubner]] series, ''[https://archive.org/details/aristotelisquif00arisgoog Aristotelis qui ferebantur librorum fragmenta]'', Leipzig, 1886, is still commonly used (indicated by ''R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''), although there is a more current edition with a different numeration by Olof Gigon (published in 1987 as a new vol. 3 in [[Walter de Gruyter]]'s reprint of the Bekker edition), and a new de Gruyter edition by [[Eckart Schütrumpf]] is in preparation.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/12/14/cu-boulder-expert-wins-75000-award-research-aristotle CU-Boulder Expert Wins $75,000 Award For Research On Aristotle,"] University of Colorado Office of News Services, December 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a selection of the fragments in English translation, see W. D. Ross, ''Select Fragments'' ([https://archive.org/details/worksofaristotle12arisuoft Oxford 1952]), and [[Jonathan Barnes]] (ed.), ''The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation'', vol. 2, Princeton 1984, pp.&amp;nbsp;2384–2465. A new translation exists of the fragments of Aristotle's ''[[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|Protrepticus]]'', by Hutchinson and Johnson (2015).&lt;ref name=HutchinsonJohnson2015&gt;{{cite web|author=D. S. Hutchinson|author2=Monte Ransome Johnson|last-author-amp=yes|url=http://blog.protrepticus.info/2015/01/new-reconstruction-includes-greek-text.html|title=New Reconstruction, includes Greek text|date=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The works surviving only in fragments include the dialogues ''On Philosophy'' (or ''On the Good''), ''Eudemus'' (or ''On the Soul''), ''On Justice'', and ''On Good Birth''.  The possibly spurious work, ''[[On Ideas]]'' survives in quotations by [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] in his commentary on Aristotle's ''Metaphysics''.  For the dialogues, see also the editions of [[Richard Rudolf Walzer]], ''Aristotelis Dialogorum fragmenta, in usum scholarum'' (Florence 1934), and Renato Laurenti, ''Aristotele: I frammenti dei dialoghi'' (2 vols.), Naples: Luigi Loffredo, 1987.

[[File:Cradled panel painting, Aert van der Neer.jpg|thumb|upright|300px|Example of a cradled panel, mounted on the back of a painting by [[Aert van der Neer]]]]
[[File:Jan Davidsz. de Heem, still life panel.jpg|300px|thumbnail|right|Example of an oak panel in its original state, the back of a [[Jan Davidsz. de Heem]] still life.]]
'''Cradling''' is a process used in the [[Painting restoration|restoration]] and preservation of [[Panel painting|paintings on wooden panel]]. It consists in mounting a grid of wooden slats to the back of a [[painting]] to create a reinforcement and preserve the flat paint surface.

Slats in either the horizontal or vertical direction are permanently fixed to the back of the panel, whilst the secondary [[perpendicular]] slats remain loose, held solely in place by the upper row. This allows for a degree of movement in the panel, which may [[Wood warping|warp]], subject to changing levels of dampness and [[atmospheric pressure]].

This procedure can often be found on [[Old Master]] paintings of the 16th and 17th Century, when painting on wood and particularly oak panel was widely practiced.

There are numerous reasons for choosing to cradle a panel. This can be done to piece back together a painting which has split and cracked over time. It can also be done to consolidate, preserve or straighten back a panel which may have warped.

There are detrimental factors to consider before cradling a painting. It is an  [[Conservation-restoration#Interventive conservation|interventive]] procedure which may involve sanding the back of the panel in order to create a flat surface to affix the cradling. It is a non reversible procedure which alters the condition and state of a work of art, which triggers [[ethical issues]].

With a lot of cradled paintings the sliding cradle members will get stuck due to the movement of the panel. This leads to a lot of tension and cracks in the panel and permanent deformation. Applying a cradle to the back of a panel painting almost always leads to more severe structural problems depending on the climate in which the painting is kept and the way the planks of the panel were saw. Nowadays, in the modern world of conservation cradling a painting has been outdated and subject to criticism.

Duke University and The University of Brussels have developed an art conservation tool that uses X-rays and algorithms to analyze the paintings. To better image the art piece, for it is of wood sections(cradles) the machine called Platypus or the computer math program sorts out the wood and finely visualizes the original art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/software-helps-art-conservators-clear-cradling|title=Software Helps Art Conservators Clear the Cradling|last=Kowalski|first=Emily|date=2015-09-08|website=Duke University Pratt School of Engineering|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Curse of the Black Sox'''/'''Curse of Shoeless Joe''' (1919–2005) was a [[superstition]] or "[[scapegoat]]" cited as one reason for the failure of the [[Chicago White Sox]] to win the [[World Series]] from {{wsy|1917}} until {{wsy|2005}}. As with other supposed baseball [[sports-related curses|curses]], such as the [[Cubs–White Sox rivalry|crosstown]] [[Chicago Cubs]]' [[Curse of the Billy Goat]], or the [[Boston Red Sox]]' [[Curse of the Bambino]], these "curses" have been publicized by the popular media over the course of time.

==The curse: 1920 to 1958==
The White Sox were dealt a severe blow in 1919 by the [[Black Sox scandal]], with several star players being suspended at a crucial time late in the 1920 season. Conventional wisdom has it that the Sox were headed for another pennant and championship and that the suspensions knocked them out of the race. In reality, the last game for the "Eight Men Out" was September 27, just three games from the end of their season. At that point the Sox had won 3 in a row and were sitting at 95-56 with 3 games to play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y=1920&amp;t=CHA|title=1920 Chicago White Sox Schedule|work=[[Baseball Almanac]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cleveland Indians]] were also in a hot streak, at 94-54 with 6 games to play, and halfway through a four-game sweep of the [[St. Louis Browns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y=1920&amp;t=CLE|title=1920 Cleveland Indians Schedule|work=[[Baseball Almanac]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indians were just a few percentage points ahead of the White Sox.

The Indians would close the season with 4 wins and 2 losses, and finish with a 98-56 record. The Sox would lose 2 of their final 3 to finish 96-58.&lt;ref name="1920 Chicago White Sox at Baseball Reference"&gt;[https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHW/1920.shtml 1920 Chicago White Sox at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; If the Sox had swept their final series against the Browns and the Indians record stayed the same, the American League would have had its first pennant playoff. Even discounting any morale boost the Indians might have received from the news of the Sox players' suspensions, the Sox return to the World Series was by no means ensured, even if there had been no suspensions. If they had finished tied, it would be noted that the Indians had won 12 of the clubs' 22 meetings, but the Sox had taken 2 of 3 in their most recent series.

In any case, the Sox finished in second place, two games behind the Indians, who went on to win (and make some history) in the [[1920 World Series]]. However, the [[New York Yankees]], who finished in third place just a game behind the Sox in [[Babe Ruth]]'s first year with the club, would go on to win the next three American League pennants, starting a dynasty that would be a difficult hurdle for the other AL clubs, including the White Sox, for many decades thereafter.

With the players' suspensions becoming permanent, the Sox fell to seventh place in 1921. It would be the mid-1930s before the team returned to the [[first division (baseball)|upper half of the league]], and the early 1950s before they became regular contenders again.

==The curse: 1959 to 2005==
When the White Sox finally won their next pennant, in 1959, [[Jack Brickhouse]] called the final out of the pennant-clinching game: ''"A forty year wait has now ended!"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Brickhouse, Jack (Broadcaster)|date=September 22, 1959|title=1959 White Sox pennant clincher|medium=Television|url=http://www.chicagobaseballmuseum.org/videos-audio/Brickhouse-3-White-Sox-penant-clincher.mp3|format=MP3|publisher=[[WGN-TV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, four decades was the longest stretch any major league team had gone without a World Series appearance (the crosstown [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]] had only gone 14 years after winning their last pennant). In that sense, the Black Sox "curse", or the apparent pall cast over the franchise for some decades in the wake of the scandal, had also finally ended. Despite the team's pennant victory, however, they lost the [[1959 World Series]] to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in six games.

The White Sox remained competitive for the next several years, but were not quite good enough to win. After a slump, they became contenders again starting in the late 1970s, and qualified for post-season play by winning the [[American League West]] division title in [[1983 Major League Baseball season|1983]] and [[1993 Major League Baseball season|1993]] and the [[American League Central]] division title in [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000]]. The "curse" discussion was revived by the national media during the 2005 post-season, when the Sox won their first league championship since 1959 (an even longer wait than before, 46 years). During the ensuing [[2005 World Series]], the White Sox swept the [[2005 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]] for their first World Series championship in 88 years (87 if the cancelled 1994 World Series is excluded).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Merkin|first=Scott|title=How sweep it is for White Sox!|url=http://m.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article/1260213|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=[[MLB.com]]|date=October 27, 2005|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20160212001550/http://m.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article/1260213|archivedate=February 12, 2016|accessdate=October 29, 2018|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of this discussion found its way to the official World Series film DVD. For example, White Sox center fielder [[Aaron Rowand]], in an interview for the DVD, compared the 2004 Red Sox with the 2005 White Sox: "If they could break their 'curse', so could we."

In one of those ways that patterns appear to emerge in sporting events, the White Sox World Series win in 2005, along with the [[Boston Red Sox]] win in 2004, symmetrically bookended the two teams' previous World Series winners and the long gaps between, with the Red Sox and White Sox last Series wins having come in 1918 and 1917, respectively.

==Skeptics==
There is a large faction of White Sox fans who dismiss the idea of a curse against the White Sox as a ridiculous (yet successful) ploy by the national media to sensationalize the team in efforts for increased ratings, instead attributing their drought to the more obvious reason: team mismanagement. The Comiskeys were very conservative spenders (which many hypothesize to be the reason that the Black Sox scandal even occurred in the first place) and it was not until 1958 that the family gave up majority ownership to [[Bill Veeck]], who was an innovative marketer but lacked sufficient resources to compete with wealthier teams.  Ownership then passed to the Allyn brothers, who almost moved the team to [[Milwaukee]] while mediocre on-field performance continued.  The team was then reacquired by Veeck, who sold it to current majority owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]], who also owns the NBA's [[Chicago Bulls]] on the West Side of town.

[[File:Paolo Uccello 050.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Paolo Uccello]]'s depiction of [[Saint George]] and the dragon, c. 1470, a classic image of a damsel in distress.]]

The '''damsel-in-distress''', '''persecuted maiden''', or '''princess in jeopardy''' is a classic theme in world literature, art, film and video games; most notably in those that have a lot of action. This [[fantasy tropes|trope]] usually involves beautiful, innocent, or helpless young female leads, placed in a dire predicament by a [[villain]], [[monster]] or [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]], and who requires a male [[hero]] to achieve her rescue. Often these young women are stereotyped as very physically weak and almost completely dependent on the male lead. After rescuing her, the hero often obtains her hand in marriage. She has become a [[stock character]] of fiction, particularly of [[melodrama]]. Though she is usually human, she can also be of any other species, including fictional or [[folklore|folkloric]] species; and even divine figures such as an [[angel]], [[spirit]], or [[deity]].

The word "damsel" derives from the French ''[[wikt:demoiselle|demoiselle]]'', meaning "young lady", and the term "damsel in distress" in turn is a translation of the French ''demoiselle en détresse''.{{cn|date=May 2017}} It is an archaic term not used in modern English except for effect or in expressions such as this. It can be traced back to the [[knight-errant]] of Medieval songs and tales, who regarded protection of women as an essential part of his [[chivalric code]] which includes a notion of [[honour]] and [[nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Johan Huizinga]] remarks in his book ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'', "the source of the chivalrous idea, is pride aspiring to beauty, and formalised pride gives rise to a conception of honour, which is the pole of noble life". Huizinga, ''[[The Autumn of the Middle Ages|The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'' (1919) 1924:58.&lt;/ref&gt; The English term "damsel in distress" itself first seems to have appeared in Richard Ames' 1692 poem "Sylvia’s Complaint of Her Sexes Unhappiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ames|first=Richard|title=Sylvia’s Complaint of Her Sexes Unhappiness : a Poem, Being the Second Part of Sylvia’s Revenge, Or, a Satyr Against Man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EDW-gC3gqx8C&amp;pg=PA1|year=1692|publisher=Richard Baldwin|location=London|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Ancient history ===
{{Unsourced section|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 011.jpg|thumb|[[Rembrandt]]'s [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] chained to the rock – a late-[[Renaissance]] damsel in distress from Greek mythology.]]

The damsel in distress theme featured in the stories of the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]]. [[Greek mythology]], while featuring a large retinue of competent [[List of Greek mythological figures|goddesses]], also contains helpless maidens threatened with sacrifice. For example, [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]]'s [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Ethiopia)|mother]] offended [[Poseidon]], who sent a beast to ravage the land. To appease him Andromeda's parents fastened her to a rock in the sea. The hero [[Perseus]] slew the beast, saving Andromeda. Andromeda in her plight, chained naked to a rock, became a favorite theme of later painters. This theme of the [[Princess and dragon]] is also pursued in the myth of [[Saint George and the Dragon|St George]].

Another early example of a damsel in distress is [[Sita]] in the ancient [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Ramayana]]''. In the epic, Sita is kidnapped by the villain [[Ravana]] and taken to [[Lanka]]. Her husband [[Rama]] goes on a quest to rescue her, with the help of the monkey-god [[Hanuman]].

=== Post-classical history ===
European [[fairy tale]]s frequently feature damsels in distress. Evil witches trapped [[Rapunzel]] in a tower, cursed the princess to die in "[[Snow White]]", and put [[Sleeping Beauty]] into a magical sleep. In all of these, a valorous prince comes to the maiden's aid, saves her, and marries her (though Rapunzel is not directly saved by the prince, but instead saves him from blindness after her exile).

The damsel in distress was an archetypal character of medieval romances, where typically she was rescued from imprisonment in a tower of a castle by a knight-errant. [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Clerk's Tale]]'' of the repeated trials and bizarre torments of patient Griselda was drawn from [[Petrarch]]. The [[Emprise de l'Escu vert à la Dame Blanche]] (founded 1399) was a [[chivalric order]] with the express purpose of protecting oppressed ladies.

The theme also entered the official [[hagiography]] of the Catholic Church – most famously in the story of [[Saint George]] who saved a princess from being devoured by a [[dragon]]. A late addition to the official account of this Saint's life, not attested in the several first centuries when he was venerated, it is nowadays the main act for which Saint George is remembered.

Obscure outside [[Norway]] is [[Hallvard Vebjørnsson]], the Patron Saint of [[Oslo]], recognised as a martyr after being killed while valiantly trying to defend a woman – most likely a [[slavery|slave]] – from three men accusing her of theft.

===Modern history===

====17th century====

In the 17th century English [[ballad]] ''[[The Spanish Lady]]'' (one of several English and Irish songs with that name), a Spanish lady captured by an English captain falls in love with her captor and begs him not to set her free but to take her with him to England, and in this appeal describes herself as "A lady in distress".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url = http://www.contemplator.com/england/slady.html
 |title = Spanish Lady
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====18th century====

[[File:Dicksee-Chivalry-1885.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Bernard Dicksee]]. ''Chivalry'']]

The damsel in distress makes her debut in the modern novel as the title character of [[Samuel Richardson]]'s ''[[Clarissa]]'' (1748), where she is menaced by the wicked seducer Lovelace.

Reprising her medieval role, the damsel in distress is a staple character of [[Gothic literature]], where she is typically incarcerated in a castle or monastery and menaced by a sadistic nobleman, or members of the religious orders. Early examples in this genre include Matilda in [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'', Emily in [[Ann Radcliffe]]'s ''[[The Mysteries of Udolpho]]'', and Antonia in [[Matthew Lewis (writer)|Matthew Lewis]]' ''[[The Monk]]''.

The perils faced by this Gothic heroine were taken to an extreme by the [[Marquis de Sade]] in ''[[The Misfortunes of Virtue|Justine]]'', who exposed the [[erotic]] subtext which lay beneath the damsel-in-distress scenario.

[[File:The Knight Errant b John Everett Millais 1870.jpg|left|thumb|[[John Everett Millais]]' ''The Knight Errant'' of 1870 saves a damsel in distress and underlines the erotic subtext of the genre.]]
One exploration of the theme of the persecuted maiden is the fate of Gretchen in [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's ''Faust'']]. According to the philosopher [[Schopenhauer]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The great Goethe has given us a distinct and visible description of this denial of the will, brought about by great misfortune and by the despair of all deliverance, in his immortal masterpiece Faust, in the story of the sufferings of Gretchen. I know of no other description in poetry. It is a perfect specimen of the second path, which leads to the denial of the will not, like the first, through the mere knowledge of the suffering of the whole world which one acquires voluntarily, but through the excessive pain felt in one's own person. It is true that many tragedies bring their violently willing heroes ultimately to this point of complete resignation, and then the will-to-live and its phenomenon usually end at the same time. But no description known to me brings to us the essential point of that conversion so distinctly and so free from everything extraneous as the one mentioned in Faust'' ([[The World as Will and Representation]], Vol. I, §68)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====19th century====

The misadventures of the damsel in distress of the Gothic continued in a somewhat caricatured form in Victorian [[melodrama]]. According to Michael Booth in his classic study ''English Melodrama'' the Victorian stage melodrama featured a limited number of stock characters: the hero, the villain, the heroine, an old man, an old woman, a comic man and a comic woman engaged in a sensational plot featuring themes of love and murder. Often the good but not very clever hero is duped by a scheming villain, who has eyes on the damsel in distress until fate intervenes to ensure the triumph of good over evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first = Michael |last = Booth |title = English Melodrama |publisher = Herbert Jenkins |year = 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such melodrama influenced the fledgling cinema industry and led to damsels in distress being the subject of many early silent films, especially those that were made as multi-episode serials. Early examples include ''[[The Adventures of Kathlyn]]'' in 1913 and ''[[The Hazards of Helen]]'', which ran from 1914 to 1917. The silent movie heroines frequently faced new perils provided by the industrial revolution and catering to the new medium's need for visual spectacle. Here we find the heroine tied to a railway track, burning buildings, and explosions. Sawmills were another stereotypical danger of the industrial age, as recorded in a popular song from a later era:
{{cquote|... A bad gunslinger called Salty Sam was chasin' poor Sweet Sue&lt;br&gt;
He trapped her in the old sawmill and said with an evil laugh,&lt;br&gt;
If you don't give me the deed to your ranch&lt;br&gt;
I'll saw you all in half!&lt;br&gt;
And then he grabbed her (and then)&lt;br&gt;
He tied her up (and then)&lt;br&gt;
He turned on the bandsaw (and then, and then...!) ...
|30px|10px|''[[Along Came Jones (song)|Along Came Jones]]'' by [[The Coasters]]}}

====20th century====
[[File:Perilsofnyoka.JPG|thumb|Jungle girl Nyoka, played by [[Kay Aldridge]], frequently found herself in distress in ''[[Perils of Nyoka]]'']]

During the [[First World War]], the imagery of a Damsel in Distress was extensively used in Allied propaganda (see illustrations). Particularly, the Imperial German conquest and occupation of Belgium was commonly referred to as [[The Rape of Belgium]] - effectively making British and French soldiers into knights bent on saving that rape victim. This was expressed explicitly in the lyrics of ''[[Keep the Home Fires Burning (1914 song) |Keep the Home Fires Burning]]'' mentioning British boys as having gone to help a "Nation in Distress". 

A form of entertainment in which the damsel-in-distress emerged as a stereotype at this time was [[stage magic]]. Restraining attractive female assistants and imperiling them with blades and spikes became a staple of 20th century magicians' acts. Noted illusion designer and historian [[Jim Steinmeyer]] identifies the beginning of this phenomenon as coinciding with the introduction of the "[[sawing a woman in half]]" illusion. In 1921 magician [[P. T. Selbit]] became the first to present such an act to the public. Steinmeyer observes that: "Before Selbit's illusion, it was not a cliche that pretty ladies were teased and tortured by magicians. Since the days of [[Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin|Robert-Houdin]], both men and women were used as the subjects for magic illusions". However, changes in fashion and great social upheavals during the first decades of the 20th century made Selbit's choice of "victim" both practical and popular. The trauma of war had helped to desensitise the public to violence and the emancipation of women had changed attitudes to them. Audiences were tiring of older, more genteel forms of magic. It took something shocking, such as the horrific productions of the [[Grand Guignol]] theatre, to cause a sensation in this age. Steinmeyer concludes that: "beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment".&lt;ref name="hiding"&gt;{{cite book |title = Hiding the Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible |first = Jim |last = Steinmeyer |publisher = William Heinemann/Random House |year = 2003 |pages = 277–295 |isbn = 0-434-01325-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The damsel-in-distress continued as a mainstay of the comics, film, and television industries throughout the 20th century. Imperiled heroines in need of rescue were a frequent occurrence in black-and-white [[film serial]]s made by studios such as [[Columbia Pictures]], [[Mascot Pictures]], [[Republic Pictures]], and [[Universal Studios]], and in the 1930s, 40s and early 50s. These serials sometimes drew inspiration for their characters and plots from adventure novels and comic books. Notable examples include the character [[Nyoka the Jungle Girl]], whom [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] created for comic books and who was later adapted into a serial heroine in Republic productions such as ''[[Perils of Nyoka]]'' (1942). Additional classic damsels in that mold were [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]], in both the novel and movie versions of ''[[Tarzan]]'', and Ann Darrow, as played by [[Fay Wray]] in the movie ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933), in one of the most iconic instances. The notorious hoax documentary ''[[Ingagi]]'' (1930) also featured this idea, and Wray's role was repeated by [[Jessica Lange]] and [[Naomi Watts]] in remakes. As journalist Andrew Erish has noted: "Gorillas plus sexy women in peril equals enormous profits".&lt;ref name="Erish"&gt;{{Cite journal |url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/959395991.html?dids=959395991:959395991&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+8%2C+2006&amp;author=Andrew+Erish&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=E.6&amp;desc=Movies |title = Illegitimate dad of 'Kong'; One of the Depression's highest-grossing films was an outrageous fabrication, a scandalous and suggestive gorilla epic that set box office records across the country |first = Andrew |last = Erish |journal = Los Angeles Times |publisher = Los Angeles Times |date = 8 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small screen iconic portrayal, this time in children's cartoons, was [[Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]]'s girlfriend, [[List of Underdog characters#Sweet Polly Purebred|Sweet Polly Purebred]].

Frequently cited examples of a damsel in distress in comics include [[Lois Lane]], who was eternally getting into trouble and needing to be rescued by [[Superman]], and [[Olive Oyl]], who was in a near-constant state of [[kidnapping|kidnap]], requiring her to be saved by [[Popeye]].

Damsels in distress have been cited as an example of differential treatment of genders in literature, film, and works of art. Feminist criticism of art, [[feminist film theory|film]], and [[feminist literary criticism|literature]] has often examined gender-oriented characterisation and plot, including the common "damsel in distress" trope, as perpetrating regressive and patronizing myths about women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://feministfrequency.com/video/damsel-in-distress-part-2-tropes-vs-women/|title=Damsel in Distress (Part 2) Tropes vs Women|date=28 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Alison Lurie, "Fairy Tale Liberation", ''The New York Review of Books'', v. 15, n. 11 (Dec. 17, 1970) (germinal work in the field); Donald Haase, "Feminist Fairy-Tale Scholarship: A Critical Survey and Bibliography", ''Marvels &amp; Tales: Journal of Fairy-Tale Studies'' v.14, n.1 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern writers and directors, such as [[Anita Sarkeesian]], [[Angela Carter]] and [[Jane Yolen]], have revisited classic [[fairy tale]]s and "damsel in distress" stories or collected and anthologised stories and [[Folklore|folk tales]] that break{{huh|date=January 2017}} the "damsel in distress" pattern.&lt;ref&gt;See Jane Yolen, "This Book Is For You", ''Marvels &amp; Tales'', v. 14, n. 1 (2000) (essay); Yolen, ''Not One Damsel in Distress: World folktales for Strong Girls'' (anthology); Jack Zipes, ''Don't Bet on the Prince: Contemporary Fairy Tales in North America and England'', Routledge: New York, 1986 (anthology).&lt;/ref&gt; 

While late twentieth-century feminist criticism may have highlighted alternatives to the damsel stereotype, the origins of some alternatives are to be found elsewhere. [[Joseph Campbell]]'s work on comparative mythology has provided a theoretical model for heroes throughout the history of literature, drama, and film, which has been further developed by [[Dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] writers such as [[Christopher Vogler]]. These theories suggest that within the underlying story arc of every hero is found an episode known as the [[Monomyth#Initiation|ordeal]], where the character is almost destroyed. By surviving fear, danger, or torture the hero proves he or she has special qualities and ultimately emerges re-invented to progress to ultimate victory. Within this theory the empowered "damsel" can be a female hero rendered powerless and imperilled during her heroic ordeal but who ultimately emerges as a strong figure who claims victory; yet the male and female versions of such ordeal and empowerment still differ at a fundamental level, in that when there is a character doing the rescuing (sometimes referred to as "help unlooked for"), he is almost invariably male.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==Empowered damsel==
Examples can be found in films that date back to the early days of movie making. One of the films most often associated with the stereotype of the damsel in distress, ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' (1914), in fact provides at least a partial counterexample, in that Pauline, as played by [[Pearl White]], is a strong character who decides against early marriage in favour of seeking adventure and becoming an author. Despite common belief, the film does not feature scenes with Pauline tied to a railroad track and threatened by a buzzsaw, although such scenes were incorporated into later re-creations and were also featured in other films made in the period around 1914. Academic Ben Singer has contested the idea that these "serial-queen melodramas" were male fantasies and has observed that they were marketed heavily at women.&lt;ref name="singer"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first motion picture serial made in the United States, ''[[What Happened to Mary?]]'' (1912), was released to coincide with a serial story of the same name published in McClure's ''Ladies' World'' magazine.

Empowered damsels were a feature of the serials made in the 1930s and 1940s by studios such as [[Republic Pictures]]. The "cliffhanger" scenes at the end of episodes provide many examples of female heroines bound and helpless and facing fiendish death traps. But those heroines, as played by actresses such as [[Linda Stirling]] and [[Kay Aldridge]], were often strong, assertive women who ultimately played an active part in vanquishing the villains.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

[[C.L. Moore]]'s 1934 story "[[Shambleau]]" – generally acknowledged as epoch-making in the history of [[science fiction]] – begins in what seems a classical damsel in distress situation: the protagonist, space adventurer [[Northwest Smith]], sees a "sweetly-made girl" pursued by a lynch mob intent on killing her and intervenes to save her, but finds her not a girl nor a human being at all, but a disguised alien creature, predatory and highly dangerous. Soon, Smith himself needs rescuing and barely escapes with his life.

These themes have received successive updates in modern-era characters, ranging from 'spy girls' of the 1960s to current movie and television heroines. In her book ''The Devil With James Bond'' (1967) Ann Boyd compared [[James Bond]] with an updating of the legend of [[St George]] and the "[[princess and dragon]]" genre, particularly with [[Julius No|Dr. No]]'s dragon tank. The damsel in distress theme is also very prominent in ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (novel)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', where the story is told in the [[First person narrative|first person]] by the young woman [[Vivienne Michel]], who is threatened with imminent rape by thugs when Bond kills them and claims her as his reward.

The female spy [[Emma Peel]] in the 1960s British television series ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' was often seen in "damsel in distress" situations. The character and her reactions, as portrayed by actress [[Diana Rigg]], differentiated these scenes from other movie and television scenarios where women were similarly imperilled as pure victims or pawns in the plot. A scene with Emma Peel bound and threatened with a death ray in the episode ''From Venus with Love'' is a direct parallel to James Bond's confrontation with a laser in the film ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''.&lt;ref name="fromvenus"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are examples of the classic hero's ordeal as described by Campbell and Vogler. The serial heroines and Emma Peel are cited as providing inspiration for the creators of strong heroines in more recent times. Ranging from Joan Wilder in ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' and [[Princess Leia]] in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' to "post feminist" icons such as [[Buffy Summers]] from ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', [[Xena]] and [[Gabrielle (Xena: Warrior Princess)|Gabrielle]] from ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'',  [[Sydney Bristow]] from ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'', [[Natasha Romanoff]] from [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], [[Kim Possible (character)|Kim Possible]] from the series of the [[Kim Possible|same name]], [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] from [[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]], and [[Veronica Mars (character)|Veronica Mars]] also from the series of the [[Veronica Mars|same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Reflecting these changes, [[Daphne Blake]] of the ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' cartoon series (who throughout the series is captured dozens of times, falls through trap doors, etc.) is portrayed in the [[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo film]] as a wisecracking feminist heroine (quote: "I've had it with this damsel in distress thing!"). The 2009 film ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' includes a classical damsel in distress episode, where [[Irene Adler]] (played by [[Rachel McAdams]]) is helplessly bound to a conveyor belt in an industrial slaughterhouse, and is saved from being sawn in half by a chainsaw; yet in other episodes of the same film Adler is strong and assertive – for example, overcoming with contemptuous ease two thugs who sought to rob her (and robbing them instead). In the film's climax it is Adler who saves the [[British Empire]], dismantling at the last moment a device set to poison the entire membership of Parliament.

In the final scene of the 2007 [[Walt Disney Pictures]] film ''[[Enchanted (2007 film)|Enchanted]]'' the traditional roles are reversed when male protagonist Robert ([[Patrick Dempsey]]) is captured by Queen Narissa ([[Susan Sarandon]]) in her dragon form. In a [[King Kong]] fashion, she carries him to the top of a New York skyscraper, until Robert's beloved [[Giselle (Disney)|Giselle]] climbs, sword in hand, to save him.

A similar role reversal is evident in [[Stieg Larsson]]'s ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'', in whose climatic scene the male protagonist is captured by a mass murderer, locked in an underground torture room, chained, stripped naked, and humiliated when his female partner enters to save him and destroy the villain. Still another example is ''[[Foxglove Summer]]'', part of [[Ben Aaronovitch]]'s ''[[Rivers of London (novel)|Rivers of London]]'' series - where the protagonist Peter Grant is bound and taken captive by the Queen of the Faeries, and it is Grant's girlfriend who comes to rescue him, riding a Steel Horse.

In [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s fairy tale ''[[The Snow Queen]]'' (1844), the protagonist Gerda, a little girl, rescues her friend Kai, a little boy, from the Snow Queen. In the 2013 film adaptation ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', Gerda and Kai are substituted with the sisters Anna and Elsa respectively.

According to Salzburge Academy on Media and Global Change, in 1981 Nintendo offered game designer Shigeru Miyamoto to create a new video game for the American market. In the game the hero was Mario, and the objective of the game was to rescue a young princess named Peach. Peach was depicted as having a pink dress and blond hair. The princess was kidnapped and trapped in a castle by the villain Bowser, who is depicted as a turtle. Princess Peach appears in 15 of the main Super Mario games and is kidnapped in 13 of them. The only main games in which Peach was not kidnapped were in the North America release of ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', but she was a character that can be played. Zelda became playable in some later games of the ''Legend of Zelda'' series or had the pattern altered.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;!-- ref name="Objectification of Women in Video Games" --&gt;

'''''Early Netherlandish Painting''''' (German: '''''Die altniederländische Malerei''''') is a pioneering 14-volume series of illustrated books by the German art historian [[Max Jakob Friedländer]] (1867–1958). The first volume was published in 1924, and the series ran until 1937. It was the first comprehensive modern art-historical survey of [[Early Netherlandish painting]],&lt;ref&gt;The painters are sometimes known as the Flemish Primitives&lt;/ref&gt; a  term often used in art history to describe artists of the [[Low Countries]] during the 15th- and 16th-century [[Northern Renaissance]].

Friedländer developed an interest in northern art of the period while director of the [[Bode Museum|Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The collection included a large selection of Flemish paintings, including [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Madonna in the Church]]'', [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' and ''[[Altar of Saint John]]'', and  [[Hugo van der Goes]]' ''Adoration of the Maji''. Friedländer was struck by the lack of biographical detail on even the most accomplished of the artists, some of whom were still identified by [[notname]]s, the sometimes poorly supported attributions, and general historical neglect.&lt;ref name="mv"&gt;McNamee (1998), vii&lt;/ref&gt;

The book focuses on establishing biographical details for the painters, attributing individual works, and detailing their major stylistic themes and techniques. The undertaking was extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists.&lt;ref name="s518"&gt;Silver (1986), 518&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was a major influence on [[Erwin Panofsky]]'s equally seminal ''[[Early Netherlandish Painting (Panofsky)|Early Netherlandish Painting]]'', which expanded on Friedländer's biographical and stylistic analysis to focus on [[iconography]], intended meaning and historical context.&lt;ref name="mv" /&gt;

'''Edward Lhuyd''' ({{IPA-cy|ˈɬɔɨd|pron}}; occasionally written as ''Llwyd'' in recent times, in accordance with Modern Welsh orthography) (1660 – 30 June 1709) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Natural history|naturalist]], [[Botany|botanist]], [[linguistics|linguist]], [[geographer]] and [[antiquary]]. He is also known by the Latinized form of his name, '''Eduardus Luidius'''.

==Life==
Lhuyd was born in [[Loppington]], [[Shropshire]], the illegitimate son of Edward Lloyd of [[Llanforda]], [[Oswestry]] and [[Bridget Pryse]] of [[Llansantffraid, Ceredigion|Llansantffraid]], near [[Tal-y-bont, Ceredigion|Talybont]], [[Cardiganshire]], and was a pupil and later a master at [[Oswestry School|Oswestry Grammar School]]. His family belonged to the gentry of south-west [[Wales]]; though well-established, his family was not well-off, and his father experimented with agriculture and industry in a manner that brought him into contact with the new science of the day. Lhuyd attended [[grammar school]] in [[Oswestry]] and went up to [[Jesus College, Oxford]] in 1682, but dropped out before his [[graduation]]. In 1684, he was appointed assistant to [[Robert Plot]], the [[Curator|Keeper]] of the [[Ashmolean Museum]] and replaced him as Keeper in 1690; he held this post until 1709.

Whilst employed by the Ashmolean he travelled extensively. A visit to [[Snowdonia]] in 1688 allowed him to construct for [[John Ray|John Ray's]] ''Synopsis Methodica Stirpium Britannicorum'' a list of [[flora]] local to that region. After 1697, Lhuyd visited every county in Wales, and then travelled to [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]], [[Cornwall]], and [[Brittany]] and the [[Isle of Man]]. In 1699, with financial aid from his friend [[Isaac Newton]], he published ''Lithophylacii Britannici Ichnographia'', a catalogue of [[fossil]]s collected from places around [[England]], mostly Oxford, and now held in the Ashmolean.

In 1701, Lhuyd was made [[Master's degree|MA]] ''[[honoris causa]]'' by the University of Oxford, and he was elected Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1708. Lhuyd died of [[pleurisy]] in Oxford in 1709.

He was responsible for the first scientific description and naming of what we would now recognize as a [[dinosaur]]: the [[sauropod]] [[tooth]] ''[[Rutellum|Rutellum implicatum]]'' (Delair and Sarjeant, 2002).

== Pioneering linguist ==
In the late 17th century, Lhuyd was contacted by a group of scholars, led by [[John Keigwin]] of [[Mousehole]], who were trying to preserve and further the [[Cornish language]] and he accepted the invitation to travel to Cornwall to study the language. Early Modern Cornish was the subject of a study published by Lhuyd in 1702; it differs from the medieval language in having a considerably simpler structure and grammar.

In 1707, having been assisted in his research by fellow Welsh scholar [[Moses Williams (antiquarian)|Moses Williams]], he published the first volume of ''Archaeologia Britannica: an Account of the Languages, Histories and Customs of Great Britain, from Travels through Wales, Cornwall, Bas-Bretagne, Ireland and Scotland''. This book is an important source for its linguistic description of Cornish, but even more so for its understanding of historical linguistics. Some of the ideas commonly attributed to linguists of the nineteenth century have their roots in this work by Lhuyd, who was "considerably more sophisticated in his methods and perceptions than [[William Jones (philologist)|[Sir William] Jones]]’’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Language Classification. History and Method|last = Campbell|first = Lyle, and William J. Poser|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2007|isbn = 978-0-521-88005-3|location = |pages = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lhuyd noted the similarity between the two [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]] families: [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] or [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages|P–Celtic]] ([[Breton language|Breton]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]]); and [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] or Q–Celtic ([[Irish language|Irish]], [[Manx language|Manx]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]]). He argued that the Brythonic languages originated in [[Gaul]] (France), and that the Goidelic languages originated in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Lhuyd concluded that as the languages had been of [[Celt]]ic origin, the people who spoke those languages were Celts. From the 18th century, the peoples of [[Brittany]], [[Cornwall]], [[Ireland]], [[Isle of Man]], [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] were known increasingly as Celts, and are regarded as the modern [[Celtic nations]] today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davies|first=John|authorlink=John Davies (historian)|title=A History of Wales| page=54 | publisher=Penguin| year=1994|location=London|isbn = 0-14-014581-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Amgueddfa DNA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who were the Celts? ...

==Legacy==

The Snowdon lily (now ''[[Gagea serotina]]'') was at one time called ''Lloydia serotina'' after Lhuyd.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

[[Cymdeithas Edward Llwyd]], the National Naturalists' Society of Wales, is named after him.

On 9 June 2001 a bronze bust of Lhuyd was unveiled outside the [[University of Wales]]'s Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies in [[Aberystwyth]], immediately adjacent to the [[National Library of Wales]], by [[Dafydd Wigley]], the former leader of [[Plaid Cymru]]. The sculptor was [[John Meirion Morris]] and the inscription on the plinth, carved by Ieuan Rees, reads {{small|EDWARD / LHUYD / 1660–1709 / IEITHYDD / HYNAFIAETHYDD / NATURIAETHWR}} ("linguist, antiquary, naturalist").&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.pmsa.org.uk/pmsa-database/11836/ |title=Edward Lhuyd Memorial |work=National Recording Project |publisher=[[Public Monuments and Sculpture Association]] | accessdate=30 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{lang|de|italic=no|Erich Friedrich Wilhelm Ludendorff}}''' (9 April 1865 – 20 December 1937) was a [[Imperial Germany|German]] general, the victor of the [[Battle of Liège]] and the [[Battle of Tannenberg]]. From August 1916, his appointment as [[Generalquartiermeister|Quartermaster general]] ({{lang-de|Erster Generalquartiermeister}}) made him the leader (along with [[Paul von Hindenburg]]) of the German war efforts during [[World War I]].  The failure of Germany's great [[Spring Offensive]] in 1918 in quest of total victory was his great strategic failure and he was forced out in October 1918.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Astore, "The Tragic Pursuit of Total Victory." ''MHQ: Quarterly Journal of Military History'' (Autumn 2007) 20#1)  pp 64-73.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the war, Ludendorff became a prominent nationalist leader, and a promoter of the [[Stab-in-the-back myth]], which posited that the German loss in World War I was caused by the betrayal of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] by [[Marxism|Marxists]], [[Bolsheviks]], and [[Jews]] who were furthermore responsible for the disadvantageous settlement negotiated for Germany in the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. He took part in the failed [[Kapp Putsch]] (coup d’état) with [[Wolfgang Kapp]] in 1920 and the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] of [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1923, and in 1925, he ran unsuccessfully for the office of [[President of Germany]] against his former superior Hindenburg.

From 1924 to 1928, he represented the [[German Völkisch Freedom Party|German {{lang|de|Völkisch|nocat=y}} Freedom Party]] in the {{lang|de|[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]}} (legislature). Consistently pursuing a purely military line of thought after the war, Ludendorff developed the theory of "[[Total War]]", which he published as {{lang|de|Der totale Krieg}} (''The Total War'') in 1935. In this work, he argued that the entire physical and moral forces of the nation should be mobilized, because [[peace]] was merely an interval between wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/350726/Erich-Ludendorff |title=Erich Ludendorff (German general) : Introduction – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=20 December 1937 |accessdate=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludendorff was a recipient of the [[Grand Cross of the Iron Cross]] and the [[Pour le Mérite]].

==Early life==
Ludendorff was born on 9 April 1865 in {{lang|pl|[[Kruszewnia]]}} near {{lang|de|[[Poznań|Posen]]}}, [[Province of Posen]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (now [[Poznań County|{{lang|pl|Poznań|nocat=y}} County]], [[Poland]]), the third of six children of August Wilhelm Ludendorff (1833–1905). His father was descended from [[Province of Pomerania (1653–1815)|Pomerania]]n merchants who had achieved the prestigious status of ''[[Junker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;William Brownell, and [[Denise Drace-Brownell]], ''The First Nazi: Erich Ludendorff, The Man Who Made Hitler Possible'' (2016) ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Erich's mother, {{lang|de|Klara Jeanette Henriette von Tempelhoff}} (1840–1914), was the daughter of the noble but impoverished {{lang|de|Friedrich August Napoleon von Tempelhoff}} (1804–1868) and his wife {{lang|de|Jeannette Wilhelmine von}} {{lang|pl|Dziembowska}} (1816–1854), who came from a [[Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions|Germanized]] [[Poles|Polish]] landed family on the side of her father {{lang|pl|Stephan von Dziembowski}} (1779–1859). Through {{lang|pl|Dziembowski}}'s wife {{lang|de|Johanna Wilhelmine von Unruh}} (1793–1862), {{lang|de|Erich}} was a remote descendant of the [[Count]]s of {{lang|de|[[Dönhoff]]}}, the [[Duke]]s of {{lang|de|[[Duchy of Liegnitz]]}} and {{lang|de|[[Duchy of Brieg]]}} and the [[Marquess]]es and [[Prince-elector|Electors]] of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]].

He had a stable and comfortable childhood, growing up on their small family farm. Erich received his early schooling from his maternal aunt and had a gift for mathematics,&lt;ref name="park"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parkinson |first1=Roger |title=Tormented warrior. Ludendorff and the supreme command |date=1978 |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |location=London |isbn=0-340-21482-1 |pages=13–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as did his younger brother {{lang|de|[[Hans Ludendorff|Hans]]}} who became a distinguished astronomer. He passed the entrance exam for the Cadet School at {{lang|de|[[Plön]]}} with distinction,&lt;ref name="park"/&gt; he was put in a class two years ahead of his age group, and thereafter he was consistently first in his class. (The famous World War II General {{lang|de|[[Heinz Guderian]]}} attended the same Cadet School, which produced many well-trained German officers.) Ludendorff's education continued at the {{lang|de|Hauptkadettenschule}} at {{lang|de|[[Groß-Lichterfelde]]}} near Berlin through 1882.&lt;ref name="DHM" /&gt;

==Pre-war military career==
[[File:Hindenburg and Ludendorff.jpg|thumb|left|[[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] and Ludendorff (right)]]

In 1885, Ludendorff was commissioned as a [[subaltern]] into the 57th Infantry Regiment, then at [[Wesel]]. Over the next eight years, he was promoted to lieutenant and saw further service in the 2nd Marine Battalion, based at [[Kiel]] and [[Wilhelmshaven]], and in the 8th Grenadier Guards at [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt on the Oder]]. His service reports reveal the highest praise, with frequent commendations. In 1893, he entered the War Academy, where the commandant, General Meckel, recommended him to the [[German General Staff|General Staff]], to which he was appointed in 1894. He rose rapidly and was a senior staff officer at the headquarters of V Corps from 1902 to 1904.

Next he joined the Great General Staff in Berlin, which was commanded by [[Alfred von Schlieffen]], Ludendorff directed the Second or Mobilization Section from 1904–13. Soon he was joined by [[Max Bauer]], a brilliant artillery officer, who became a close friend. 

In 1910 at age 45 "the 'old sinner', as he liked to hear himself called"&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, 1978, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;  married the daughter of a wealthy factory owner, {{lang|de|Margarethe Schmidt}} (1875–1936).  They met in a rainstorm when he offered his umbrella. She  divorced to marry him, bringing three stepsons and a stepdaughter.&lt;ref name="DHM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/biografien/LudendorffErich/index.html |title=Biografie Erich Ludendorff (German) |publisher=[[Deutsches Historisches Museum]] |date= |accessdate= 6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their marriage pleased both families and he was devoted to his stepchildren.

By 1911, Ludendorff was a full colonel. His section was responsible for writing the mass of detailed orders needed to bring the mobilized troops into position to implement the [[Schlieffen Plan|{{lang|de|Schlieffen|nocat=y}} Plan]].  For this they covertly surveyed frontier fortifications in Russia, France and Belgium.  For instance, in 1911 Ludendorff visited the key Belgian fortress city of [[Liège]].

Deputies of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], which became the largest party in the {{lang|de|[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]}} after the [[German federal election, 1912|German federal elections of 1912]], seldom gave priority to army expenditures, whether to build up its reserves or to fund advanced weaponry such as {{lang|de|[[Krupp]]}}'s siege cannons. Instead, they preferred to concentrate military spending on the [[Imperial German Navy]]. Ludendorff's calculations showed that to properly implement the Schlieffen Plan the Army lacked six corps.

Members of the General Staff were instructed to keep out of politics and the public eye,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Stein |first1=General |title=A War Minister and his work.  Reminiscences of 1914–1918 |date=1920 |publisher=Skeffington &amp; Son |location=London |page=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Ludendorff shrugged off such restrictions. With a retired general, [[August Keim]], and the head of the Pan-German League, Heinrich Class, he vigorously lobbied the {{lang|de|Reichstag}} for the additional men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=John |title=The warlords : Hindenburg and Ludendorff |date=2005 |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location=London |page=44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1913 funding was approved for four additional corps but Ludendorff was  transferred to regimental duties as commander of the 39th (Lower Rhine) [[Fusilier]]s, stationed at [[Düsseldorf]]. "I attributed the change partly for my having pressed for those three additional army corps."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ludendorff |first1=Erich |title=Ludendorff’s Own Story |date=1919 |publisher=Harper and Brothers |location=New York |page=31 |volume=I }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Tuchman]] characterizes Ludendorff in her book ''[[The Guns of August]]'' as Schlieffen's devoted disciple who was a glutton for work and a man of granite character but who was deliberately friendless and forbidding and therefore remained little known or liked. It is true that as his wife testified, "Anyone who knows Ludendorff knows that he has not a spark of humor...".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ludendorff |first1=M |title=My married life with Ludendorff |date=1929 |publisher=Hutchinson |location=London |page=25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was voluble nonetheless, although he shunned small talk. John Lee,&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 2005, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; states that while Ludendorff was with his Fusiliers, "he became the perfect regimental commander ... the younger officers came to adore him."  His adjutant, Wilhelm Breucker, became a devoted lifelong friend.

==Liège==
At the outbreak of war in the summer of 1914 Ludendorff was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff to the German Second Army under General [[Karl von Bülow]]. His assignment was largely due to his previous work investigating defenses of [[Liège]], Belgium. At the beginning of the [[Battle of Liège|Battle of Liège]], Ludendorff was an observer with the 14th Brigade, which was to infiltrate the city at night and secure the bridges before they could be destroyed. The brigade commander was killed on 5 August, so Ludendorff led the successful assault to occupy the city and its citadel. In the following days, two of the forts guarding the city were taken by desperate frontal infantry attacks, while the remaining forts were smashed by huge [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Krupp 42-cm]] and Austro-Hungarian Skoda 30-cm howitzers. By 16 August, all the forts around Liège had fallen, allowing the German First Army to advance. As the victor of Liège, Ludendorff was awarded Germany's highest military decoration for gallantry, the [[Pour le Mérite]], presented by Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] himself on 22 August.&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, 1978. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Command in the East==
German mobilization earmarked a single army, the Eighth, to defend their eastern frontier. Two Russian armies invaded East Prussia earlier than expected, the Eighth Army commanders panicked and were fired by ''OHL'', {{lang|de|[[Oberste Heeresleitung]]}}, German Supreme Headquarters. ''OHL'' assigned Ludendorff as the new chief of staff, while the War Cabinet chose a retired general, [[Paul von Hindenburg]], as commander.  They first met on their private train heading east.  They agreed that they must annihilate the nearest Russian army before they tackled the second.  On arrival, they discovered that General [[Max Hoffmann]] had already shifted much of the 8th Army by rail to the south to do just that, in an amazing feat of logistical planning. Nine days later the Eighth Army surrounded most of a Russian army at [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]], taking 92,000 prisoners in one of the great victories in German history.  Twice during the battle Ludendorff wanted to break off, fearing that the second Russian army was about to strike their rear, but Hindenburg held firm.

Then they turned on the second invading army in the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|Battle of the Masurian Lakes]]; it fled with heavy losses to escape encirclement.  During the rest of 1914, commanding an Army Group, they staved off the projected invasion of German [[Silesia]] by dexterously moving their outnumbered forces into [[Russian Poland]], fighting the battle of the [[Battle of the Vistula River|Vistula River]], which ended with a brilliantly executed withdrawal during which they destroyed the Polish railway lines and bridges needed for an invasion. When the Russians had repaired most of the damage the Germans struck their flank in the [[battle of Łódź (1914)|battle of Łódź]], where they almost surrounded another Russian Army.  Masters of surprise and deft maneuver, they argued that if properly reinforced they could trap the entire Russian army in Poland. During the winter of 1914–15 they lobbied passionately for this strategy, but were rebuffed by ''OHL''.

Early in 1915 they surprised the Russian army that still held a toehold in East Prussia by attacking in a snowstorm and surrounding it in the [[Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes]].  ''OHL'' then transferred Ludendorff, but Hindenburg's personal plea to the Kaiser reunited them.  [[Erich von Falkenhayn]], supreme commander at ''OHL'', came east to attack the flank of the Romanian army that was pushing through the Carpathian passes towards Hungary.  Employing overwhelming artillery, the Germans and Austro-Hungarians broke through the line between [[Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive|{{lang|pl|Gorlice|nocat=y}} and {{lang|pl|Tarnów|nocat=y}}]] and kept pushing until the Russians were driven out of most of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], the Austro-Hungarian southern part of partitioned Poland.  During this advance Falkenhayn rejected schemes to try to cut off the Russians in Poland, preferring direct frontal attacks.  Outgunned, during the summer of 1915 the Russian commander [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856–1929)|Grand Duke Nicholas]] shortened his lines by withdrawing from most of Poland, destroying railroads, bridges, and many buildings while driving 743,000 Poles,  
350,000 Jews, 300,000 Lithuanians and 250,000 Latvians into Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kershaw |first1=Ian |title=To Hell and back. Europe 1914–1949 |date=2015 |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |page=77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hindenburg-ludendorff.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Hindenburg (seated) and Ludendorff. Painting by [[Hugo Vogel]]]]

During the winter of 1915–16 Ludendorff's headquarters was in [[Kaunas]].  They occupied present-day Lithuania, western Latvia, and north eastern Poland, an area almost the size of France. Ludendorff demanded Germanization of the conquered territories and far-ranging annexations, offering land to German settlers; ''see {{lang|de|[[Drang nach Osten]]}}''. Far reaching plans envisioned Courland and Lithuania turned into border states ruled by German military governor commanders answerable only to the German Emperor.&lt;ref name="Baranowski 2010"&gt;''Nazi Empire: German Colonialism and Imperialism from Bismarck to Hitler'', page 102,  Shelley Baranowski, Cambridge University, Press 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed  massive annexations and colonisation in Eastern Europe in the event of the victory of the German Reich, and was one of the main supporters of the [[Polish Border Strip]].&lt;ref&gt;''Armies of occupation'' page 128 Roy Arnold Prete, A. Hamish Ion - Wilfrid Laurier University Press 1984 &lt;/ref&gt; Ludendorff planned to combine German settlement and Germanisation in conquered areas with expulsions of native populations; and envisioned an eastern German empire whose resources would be used in future war with [[Great Britain]] and [[United States]]&lt;ref name="Baranowski 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The silent dictatorship: the politics of the German high command under Hindenburg and Ludendorff, 1916–1918''. page 193, Martin Kitchen&lt;/ref&gt; Ludendorff's plans went as far as making [[Crimea]] a German colony&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Modern Germany, Volume 3: 1840–1945''. Hajo Holborn, page 488, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; As to the various nations and ethnic groups in conquered territories, Ludendorff believed they were "incapable of producing real culture" &lt;ref&gt;''The German Myth of the East: 1800 to the Present''. Vejas Gabriel Liulevicius - 2010, page 138&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 16 March 1916 the Russians, now with adequate supplies of cannons and shells, attacked parts of the new German defenses, intending to penetrate at two points and then to pocket the defenders.  They attacked almost daily until the end of the month, but the [[Lake Naroch Offensive]] failed, "choked in swamp and blood".&lt;ref&gt;Ludendorff, 1919, '''I''',  p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russians did better attacking the Austro-Hungarians in the south; the [[Brusilov Offensive]] cracked their lines with a well-prepared surprise wide-front attack led by well-schooled assault troops. The breakthrough was finally stemmed by Austro-Hungarian troops recalled from Italy stiffened with German advisers and reserves.  In July, Russian attacks on the Germans in the north were beaten back.  On 27 July 1916 Hindenburg was given command of all troops on the Eastern Front from the Baltic to [[Brody]] in the Ukraine.  They visited their new command on a special train, and then set up headquarters in [[Brest, Belarus|Brest-Litovsk]].  By August 1916 their front was holding everywhere.

==Military duumvirate with Hindenburg==
In the West in 1916 the Germans attacked unsuccessfully at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] and soon were reeling under British and French blows along the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]].  Ludendorff's friends at ''OHL'', led by Max Bauer, lobbied for him relentlessly. The balance was tipped when Romania entered the war, thrusting into Hungary.  Falkenhayn was replaced as Chief of the General Staff by Field Marshal Hindenburg on 29 August 1916.  Ludendorff was his chief of staff as first [[Quartermaster general]], with the stipulation that he would have joint responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parkinson |first1=Roger |title=Tormented warrior, Ludendorff and the supreme Command |date=1978 |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |location=London |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to [[General of the Infantry (Germany)|General of the Infantry]].  Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg|Bethmann-Hollweg]] warned the War Cabinet: "You don't know Ludendorff, who is only great at a time of success. If things go badly he loses his nerve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Müller |first1=Georg |editor-last1=Görlitz |editor-first1=Walter |title=The Kaiser and his court : the diaries, notebooks, and letters of Admiral Georg Alexander von Müller, chief of the naval cabinet, 1914–1918 |date=1961 |publisher=Macdonald |location=London |page=406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Their first concern  was the sizable Romanian Army, so troops sent from the Western Front checked Romanian and Russian incursions into Hungary. Then Romania was invaded from the south by German, Austro-Hungarian, Bulgarian, and Ottoman troops commanded by [[August von Mackensen]] and from the north by a German and Austro-Hungarian army commanded by Falkenhayn.  Bucharest fell in December 1916.  According to Mackensen, Ludendorff's distant management consisted of "floods of telegrams, as superfluous as they were offensive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Churchill|first1=Winston S.|title=The World Crisis|date=1949|publisher=Charles Scribner Sons|location=New York|page=685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When sure that the Romanians would be defeated ''OHL'' moved west, retaining the previous staff except for the operations officer, blamed for Verdun.  They toured the Western Front meeting {{mdash}}and evaluating{{mdash}} commanders, learning about their problems and soliciting their opinions.  At each meeting Ludendorff did most of the commander's talking. There would be no further attacks at Verdun and the Somme would be defended by revised tactics that exposed fewer men to British shells. A new backup defensive line would be built, like the one they had constructed in the east.  The Allies called the new fortifications the [[Hindenburg Line]]. The German goal was victory, which they defined as a Germany with extended borders that could be more easily defended in the next war.

Hindenburg was given titular command over all of the forces of the Central Powers. Ludendorff's hand was everywhere. Every day he was on the telephone with the staffs of their armies and the Army was deluged with "Ludendorff's paper barrage" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Binding |first1=Rudolph |title=A Fatalist at War |date=1929 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |page=179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of orders, instructions and demands for information.  His finger extended into every aspect of the German war effort. He issued the two daily communiques, and often met with the newspaper and newsreel reporters. Before long the public idolized him as their Army's brain.

==The Home Front==
Ludendorff had a goal: "One thing was certain{{mdash}} the power must be in my hands."&lt;ref&gt;Ludendorff, 1919, '''2''', p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;  As stipulated by the [[Constitution of the German Empire]] the government was run by civil servants appointed by the Kaiser. Confident that army officers were superior to civilians, ''OHL'' volunteered  to oversee the economy:  procurement, raw materials, labor, and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Feldman |first1=Gerald D. |title=Army, Industry and Labor in Germany 1914–1918 |date=1966 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |page=180 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bauer, with his industrialist friends, knew exactly what should be done, beginning by setting overambitious targets for military production in what they called the [[Hindenburg Programme|Hindenburg Program]]. Ludendorff enthusiastically participated in meetings on economic policy{{mdash}} loudly, sometimes pummeling the table with his fists. Implementation of the Program was assigned to General [[Wilhelm Groener|Groener]], a staff officer who had directed the Field Railway Service effectively. His office was in the War Ministry, not in ''OHL'' as Ludendorff had wanted. Therefore, he assigned staff officers to most of the government ministries, so he knew what was going on and could press his demands.

War industry's major problem was the scarcity of skilled workers, therefore 125,000 men were released from the armed forces and trained workers were no longer conscripted.  ''OHL'' wanted to enroll most German men and women into national service, but the Reichstag legislated that only males 17–60 were subject to "patriotic service" and refused to bind war workers to their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=John |title=The warlords : Hindenburg and Ludendorff |date=2005 |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location=London |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Groener realized that they needed the support of the workers, so he insisted that union representatives be included on industrial dispute boards. He also advocated an excess profits tax. The industrialists were incensed. On 16 August 1917 Ludendorff telegraphed an order reassigning Groener to command the 33rd Infantry Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kitchen |first1=Martin |title=The Silent Dictatorship. The Politics of the German High Command under Hindenburg and Ludendorff, 1916–1918 |date=1976 |publisher=Croom Helm |location=London |page=146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, "unable to control labour and unwilling to control industry, the army failed miserably"&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, 1966, p. 478.&lt;/ref&gt; (actually the government did control industry with its edicts and orders — and the result was disaster). To the public it seemed that Ludendorff was running the nation as well as the war. According to Ludendorff, "the authorities ... represented me as a dictator".&lt;ref&gt;Ludendorff, 1919,'''I''', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  He would not become Chancellor because the demands for running the war were too great.&lt;ref&gt;Ludendorff, 1919,  '''II''', 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Frank Tipton]] argues that while not technically a dictator, Ludendorff was "unquestionably the most powerful man in Germany" in 1917–18.&lt;ref&gt;Tipton, Frank B. ''A History of Modern Germany'' University of California Press, 2003, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

''OHL'' did nothing to mitigate the food disaster: despite the blockade everyone could have been fed adequately, but supplies were not managed effectively or fairly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=van der Kloot |first1=William |title=Great scientists wage the Great War |date=2014 |publisher=Fonthill |location=Stroud |pages=71–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Spring 1918 half of all the meat, eggs and fruit consumed in Berlin were sold on the black market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moyer |first1=L. V. |title=Victory Must be Ours |date=1995 |publisher=Hippocrene Books |location=New York |page=284 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In government==
The navy advocated unrestricted submarine warfare, which would surely bring the United States into the war. The Kaiser asked his commanders to listen to the warnings of his friend, the eminent chemist [[Walther Nernst]], who knew America well. Ludendorff promptly ended the meeting, it was "incompetent nonsense with which a civilian was wasting his time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mendelsohn |first1=Kurt |title=The World of Walther Nernst. The rise and Fall of German Science, 1864–1941 |date=1973 |publisher=MacMillan |location=London |page=92 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unrestricted submarine warfare began in February 1917, with ''OHL''’s strong support.  This fatal mistake reflected poor military judgment in uncritically accepting the Navy’s contention that there were no countermeasures, like convoying, and confident that the American armed forces were too feeble to fight effectively. Ultimately Germany was at war with 27 nations.

In the spring of 1917 the Reichstag passed a resolution for peace without annexations or indemnities.  They would be content with the successful defensive war undertaken in 1914. ''OHL'' was unable to defeat the resolution or to have it substantially watered down. The commanders despised Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg as weak, so they forced his resignation by repeatedly  threatening to resign themselves, despite the Kaiser's admonition that this was not their business. He was replaced by a minor functionary, [[Georg Michaelis]], the food minister, who announced that he would deal with the resolution as "in his own fashion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=de Gaulle |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles de Gaulle |title=The enemy's house divided |date=2002 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |location=Chapel Hill, NC |page=113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this put-down, the Reichstag voted the financial credits needed for continuing the war.

Ludendorff insisted on the huge territorial losses forced on the Russians in the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], even though this required that a million German soldiers remain in the east. During the peace negotiations with the Romanians his representative kept demanding the economic concessions coveted by the German industrialists. The commanders kept blocking attempts to frame a plausible peace offer to the western powers by insisting on borders expanded for future defense. Ludendorff regarded the Germans as the "master race"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Delbrück |first1=Hans |title=Ludendorffs selbstportrait |date=1922 |publisher=Verlag für Politik und Wirtschaft |location=Berlin |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and after victory planned to settle ex-soldiers in the Baltic states and in [[Alsace Lorraine]], where they would take over property seized from the French.&lt;ref name="Ludendorff, 1919, II, p. 76"&gt;Ludendorff, 1919, '''II''', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; One after another ''OHL'' toppled government ministers they regarded as weak.

=="Peace Offensive" in the West==
In contrast to ''OHL's'' questionable interventions in politics and diplomacy, their armies continued to excel. The commanders would agree on what was to be done and then Ludendorff and the ''OHL'' staff produced the mass of orders specifying exactly what was to be accomplished. On the western front they stopped packing defenders in the front line, which reduced losses to enemy artillery.  They issued a directive on elastic defense, in which attackers who penetrated a lightly held front line entered a battle zone in which they were punished by artillery and counterattacks.  It remained German Army doctrine through [[World War II]]; schools taught the new tactics to all ranks.  Its effectiveness is illustrated by comparing the first half of 1916 in which 77 German soldiers died or went missing for every 100 British to the second half when 55 Germans were lost for every 100 British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=van der Kloot |first1=William |title=World War I fact book |date=2010 |publisher=Amberley |location=Stroud, Gloucestershire |page=110 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1987-127-09A, Paul von Hindenburg, Erich Ludendorff.jpg|thumb|upright=1.03|Hindenburg and Ludendorff (pointing), 1917]]

In February 1917, sure that the new French commander General [[Robert Nivelle]] would attack and correctly foreseeing that he would try to pinch off  the German salient between [[Arras]] and [[Noyon]], they withdrew to the segment of the [[Hindenburg line]] across the base of the salient, leaving the ground they gave up as a depopulated waste land, in {{lang|de|[[Operation Alberich]]}}. The [[Second Battle of the Aisne|Nivelle Offensive]] in April 1917 was blunted by mobile defense in depth. Many French units [[French Army Mutinies|mutinied]], though ''OHL'' never grasped the extent of the disarray. 
The British supported their allies with a successful attack [[Battle of Arras (1917)|near Arras]]. Their major triumph was capturing [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]], using innovative tactics in which infantry platoons were subdivided into specialist groups. The Ridge gave the British artillery observers superb views of the German line but elastic defense prevented further major gains.  
The British had another success in June 1917 when a meticulously planned attack, beginning with the detonation of mines containing more high explosive than ever fired before, took the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Messines Ridge]] in Flanders. This was a preface to the British drive, beginning at the end of July 1917, toward the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele Ridge]], intended as a first step in retaking the Belgian coast line. At first the defense was directed by General [[Fritz von Lossberg|von Lossberg]], a pioneer in defense in depth, but when the British adjusted their tactics Ludendorff took over day by day control. The British finally took the Ridge, it was impossible to stop determined attacks that inched forward for preset, limited gains, but the British paid a heavy price.

Ludendorff worried about declining morale, so in July 1917 ''OHL'' established a propaganda unit.  In October 1917 they began mandatory patriotic lectures to the troops, who were assured that if the war was lost they would "become slaves of international capital".&lt;ref&gt;Ludendorff, 1919, '''II''', p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  The lecturers were to "ensure that a fight is kept up against all agitators, croakers and weaklings".&lt;ref&gt;Binding, 1929, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Following the overthrow of the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]], the new Russian government launched the [[Kerensky Offensive]] in July 1917 attacking the Austro-Hungarian lines in [[Galicia (Europe Europe)|Galicia]].  After minor successes the Russians were driven back and many of their soldiers refused to fight.  The counterattack was halted only after the line was pushed {{convert|240|km|mi}} eastwards.  The Germans capped the year in the East by capturing the strong Russian fortress of [[Battle of Jugla|Riga]] in September 1917, starting with a brief, overwhelming artillery barrage using many gas shells then followed by infiltrating infantry.  The Bolsheviks seized power and soon were at the peace table.

To bolster the wobbling Austro-Hungarian government, the Germans provided some troops and led a joint attack in Italy in October. They sliced through the Italian lines in the mountains at [[Battle of Caporetto|Caporetto]].  Two hundred and fifty thousand Italians were captured and the rest of Italian Army was forced to retreat to the Grappa-Piave defensive line.

On 20 November 1917 the British achieved a total surprise by attacking at [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]]. A short, intense bombardment preceded an attack by tanks which led the infantry through the German wire. It was Ludendorff's 52nd birthday, but he was too upset to attend the celebratory dinner. The British were not organized to exploit their break-through, and German reserves counterattacked, in some places driving the British back beyond their starting lines. The local German commander had not implemented defense in depth. 

[[File:Hindenburg, Kaiser, Ludendorff HD-SN-99-02150.JPG|thumb|left|325px|Hindenburg, Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], and Ludendorff, January 1917]]

At the beginning of 1918 almost a million munition workers struck; one demand was peace without annexations. ''OHL'' ordered that {{" '}}all strikers fit to bear arms' be sent to the front, thereby degrading military service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ludwig |first1=Emil |title=Hindenburg and the saga of the German revolution |date=1935 |publisher=William Heinemann |location=London |page=153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Russia out of the war, the Germans outnumbered the Allies on the Western Front.  After extensive consultations, ''OHL'' planned a series of attacks to drive the British out of the war. During the winter all ranks were schooled in the innovative tactics proven at Caporetto and Riga.  The first attack, [[Operation Michael]], was on 21 March 1918 near Cambrai.  After an effective [[hurricane bombardment]] coordinated by Colonel [[Georg Bruchmüller|Bruchmüller]], they slashed through the British lines, surmounting the obstacles that had thwarted their enemies for three years.  On the first day they occupied as large an area as the Allies had won on the Somme after 140 days.  The Allies were aghast, but it was not the triumph ''OHL'' had hoped for:  they had planned another Tannenberg by surrounding tens of thousands of British troops in the Cambrai salient,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zabecki |first1=David T. |title=The German 1918 Offensives: A case study in the operational level of war |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |page=114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but had been thwarted by stout defense and fighting withdrawal. They lost as many men as the defenders; {{mdash}}the first day was the bloodiest of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herwig |first1=Holger L. |title=The First World War, Germany and Austria-Hungary 1914–1918 |date=1997 |publisher=Arnold |location=London |page=403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the dead was Ludendorff’s oldest stepson, a younger had been killed earlier. They were unable to cut any vital railway. When Ludendorff motored near the front he was displeased by seeing how:  "The numerous slightly wounded made things difficult by the stupid and displeasing way in which they hurried to the rear." &lt;ref&gt;Ludendorff, 1919, '''II''', p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Americans doubled the number of troops being sent to France.

Their next attack was [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|in Flanders]]. Again they broke through, advancing {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and forcing the British to give back all of the ground that they had won the preceding year after weeks of battle.  But the Germans were stopped short of the rail junction that was their goal.  Next, to draw French reserves south, they struck along the {{lang|fr|[[Third Battle of the Aisne|Chemin de Dames]]}}. In their most successful attack yet they advanced {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the first day, crossing the Marne but stopping {{convert|56|km|mi}} from Paris.  But each triumph weakened their army and its morale. From 20 March 1918 to 25 June the German front lengthened from {{convert|390|km|mi}} to {{convert|510|km|mi}}.
Then they struck near Reims, to seize additional railway lines for use in the salient, but were foiled by brilliant French elastic tactics. Undeterred, on 18 July 1918 Ludendorff, still "aggressive and confident",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=von Lossberg |first1=Fritz |title=Meine Tätigkeit im Weltkriege 1914–1918 |date=1939 |publisher=E. S. Mittler &amp; Sohn |location=Berlin |page=343 }}&lt;/ref&gt; traveled to Flanders to confer about the next attack there.  A telephone call reported that the French and Americans led by a mass of tanks had smashed through the right flank of their salient pointing toward Paris, on the opening day of the [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Battle of Soissons]]. Everyone present realized that surely they had lost the war. Ludendorff was shattered. 

''OHL'' began to withdraw step by step to new defensive lines, first evacuating all of their wounded and supplies.  Ludendorff's communiques, which hitherto had been largely factual, now distorted the news, for instance claiming that American troops had to be herded onto troop ships by special police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maurice|first1=Major-General Sir F.|title=The last four months: The end of the war in the west|date=1919|publisher=Cassell|location=London|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 August 1918 they were completely surprised at [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]] when British tanks broke through the defenses and intact German formations surrendered. To Ludendorff it was the "black day in the history of the German Army".&lt;ref&gt;Ludendorff, 1919, '''II''', p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; The German retreats continued, pressed by Allied attacks. ''OHL'' still vigorously opposed offering to give up the territory they desired in France and Belgium, so the German government was unable to make a plausible peace proposal.

Ludendorff became increasingly cantankerous, railing at his staff without cause, publicly accusing the field marshal of talking nonsense, and sometimes bursting into tears.  Bauer wanted him replaced, but instead {{lang|de|Oberstabarzt}} Hochheimer was brought to ''OHL'', he had worked closely with Ludendorff in Poland during the winter of 1915–16 on plans to bring in German colonists,&lt;ref name="Ludendorff, 1919, II, p. 76"/&gt; before the war he had a practice in nervous diseases. The doctor "spoke as a friend and he listened as a friend",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Foerester |first1=Wolfgang |title=Der Feldherr Ludendorff im Unglück |date=1952 |publisher=Limes |location=Weisbaden |page=75 }}&lt;/ref&gt; convincing Ludendorff that he could not work effectively with one hour of sleep a night and that he must relearn how to relax.  After a month away from headquarters his patient had recovered from the severest symptoms of battle fatigue.

==Downfall==
On 29 September 1918 Ludendorff and Hindenburg told an incredulous Kaiser that they must have an immediate armistice. A new Chancellor, [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]], approached President [[Woodrow Wilson]] but his terms were stiff and the Army fought on. The chancellor told the Kaiser that he and his cabinet would resign unless Ludendorff was removed, but that Hindenburg must remain to hold the army together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=Alexander |title=Ring of Steel. Germany and Austria-Hungary at war 1914–1918 |date=2014 |publisher=Allen Lane |location=London |page=551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kaiser called his commanders in, curtly accepting Ludendorff's resignation and then rejecting Hindenburg's. Ludendorff would not accompany the field marshal back to headquarters, "I refused to ride with you because you have treated me so shabbily".&lt;ref&gt;von  Müller, 1961,  p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludendorff had assiduously sought all of the credit, now he was rewarded with all of the blame. Widely despised, and with revolution breaking out, he was hidden by his brother and a network of friends until he slipped out of Germany disguised in blue spectacles and a false beard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goodspeed |first1=D. J. |title=Ludendorff Soldier: Dictator: Revolutionary |date=1966 |publisher=Rupert Hart-Davis |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and fake [[Finnish passport]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Jorma Keränen |title=Suomen itsenäistymisen kronikka: Ludendorff saa suomalaisen passin|url= |location=|publisher=Gummerus  |pages=153 |date= |isbn=951-20-3800-5}} {{fi}} &lt;/ref&gt;   settling in a Swedish admirer's country home, until the Swedish government asked him to leave in February 1919. In seven months he wrote two volumes of detailed memoirs. Friends, led by Breucker, provided him with documents and negotiated with publishers. Groener (who is not mentioned in the book) characterized it as a showcase of his "caesar-mania".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Breucker |first1=Wilhelm |title=Die Tragik Ludendorffs. Eine kritische erinnerung an den general und seine zeit |date=1953 |publisher=Helmut Rauschenbusch |location=Berlin |page=53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a brilliant general, according to Wheeler-Bennett he was "certainly one of the greatest routine military organizers that the world has ever seen",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wheeler-Bennett |first1=John |title=Ludendorff: The Soldier and the Politician |journal=Virginia Quarterly |date=1938 |volume=14 |issue=2 |page=187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was a ruinous political meddler.  The influential military analyst [[Hans Delbrück]] concluded that "The Empire was built by {{lang|de|[[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Moltke]]}} and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], destroyed by [[Alfred von Tirpitz|Tirpitz]] and Ludendorff."&lt;ref&gt;Delbrück, 1922, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the Great War==
In exile, Ludendorff wrote numerous books and articles about the German military's conduct of the war while forming the foundation for the {{lang|de|[[Dolchstosslegende]]}}, the "stab-in-the-back theory," for which he is considered largely responsible.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Nebelin, Manfred: ''Ludendorff: Diktator im Ersten Weltkrieg'', Munich: Siedler Verlag--Verlagsgruppe Random House, 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludendorff was convinced that Germany had fought a defensive war and, in his opinion, that Kaiser Wilhelm II had failed to organize a proper counter-propaganda campaign or provide efficient leadership.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Ludendorff was extremely suspicious of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] and leftists, whom he blamed for the humiliation of Germany through the [[Versailles Treaty]]. Ludendorff claimed that he paid close attention to the business element (especially the Jews), and saw them turn their backs on the war effort by — as he saw it — letting profit, rather than patriotism, dictate production and financing.

Again focusing on the left, Ludendorff was appalled by the strikes that took place towards the end of the war and the way that the home front collapsed before the military front did, with the former poisoning the morale of soldiers on temporary leave. Most importantly, Ludendorff felt that the German people as a whole had underestimated what was at stake in the war; he was convinced that the Entente had started the war and was determined to dismantle Germany completely.

Ludendorff wrote:
{{quote|By the [[German Revolution|Revolution]] the Germans have made themselves pariahs among the nations, incapable of winning allies, [[helots]] in the service of foreigners and foreign capital, and deprived of all self-respect. In twenty years' time, the German people will curse the parties who now boast of having made the Revolution. |author=Erich Ludendorff, ''My War Memories, 1914–1918''}}

==Political career in the Republic==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00344A, München, nach Hitler-Ludendorff Prozess.jpg|thumb|400px||Ludendorff (centre) with Hitler and other early Nazi leaders and prominent radical German nationalists]]

Ludendorff returned to Berlin in February 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.vqronline.org/articles/1938/spring/wheelerbennett-ludendorff-soldier/ |title=Ludendorff: The Soldier and the Politician |author=John W. Wheeler-Bennett |journal=Virginia Quarterly |date=Spring 1938 |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=187–202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Staying at the [[Hotel Adlon|Adlon Hotel]], he talked with another resident, Sir [[Neill Malcolm]], the head of the British Military Mission.  After Ludendorff presented his excuses for the German defeat Malcolm said "you mean that you were stabbed in the back?",&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, 1978, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; ironically coining a key catchphrase for the German right-wing.

On 12 March 1920 5,000 {{lang|de|[[Freikorps]]}} troops under the command of [[Walther von Lüttwitz]] marched on the Chancellery, forcing the government led by [[Friedrich Ebert]] and [[Gustav Bauer]] to flee the city. The putschists proclaimed a new government with a right-wing politician, [[Wolfgang Kapp]] as new "chancellor". Ludendorff and Max Bauer were part of the putsch. The [[Kapp Putsch]] was soon defeated by a general strike that brought Berlin to a standstill. The leaders fled, Ludendorff to Bavaria, where a right-wing coup had succeeded. He published two volumes of annotated {{mdash}}and in a few instances pruned {{mdash}} documents and commentaries documenting his war service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ludendorff |first1=Erich |title=Urkunden der Obersten Heeresleitung über ihre Tätigkeit, 1916–18 / herausgegeben von Erich Ludendorff |date=1920 |publisher=E. S. Mittler |location=Berlin }}&lt;/ref&gt; He reconciled with Hindenburg, who began to visit every year.

In May 1923 Ludendorff had an agreeable first meeting with [[Adolf Hitler]], and soon he had regular contacts with National Socialists. On 8 November 1923, the Bavarian {{lang|de|Staatskomissar}} [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr|Gustav von Kahr]] was addressing a jammed meeting in a large beer hall, the {{lang|de|Bürgerbräukeller}}. Hitler, waving a pistol, jumped onto the stage, announcing that the national revolution was underway. The hall was occupied by armed men who covered the audience with a machine gun, the first move in the [[Beer Hall Putsch]]. Hitler announced that he would lead the {{lang|de|Reich}} Government and Ludendorff would command the army.  He addressed the now enthusiastically supportive audience and then spent the night in the War Ministry, unsuccessfully trying to obtain the army's backing. 

The next morning 3,000 armed Nazis formed outside of the {{lang|de|Bürgerbräukeller}} and marched into central Munich, the leaders just behind the flag bearers. They were blocked by a cordon of police, firing broke out for less than a minute. Most of the Nazi leaders were hit or dropped to the ground. Ludendorff and his adjutant Major Streck marched to the police line where they pushed aside the rifle barrels. He was respectfully arrested. He was indignant when sent home while the other leaders remained in custody. Four police officers and 14 Nazis had been killed, including Ludendorff's servant.

They were tried in early 1924. Ludendorff was acquitted, but Heinz was convicted of chauffeuring him, given a one-year suspended sentence and fined 1,000 marks. Hitler went to prison but was released after nine months. Ludendorff's 60th birthday was celebrated by massed bands and a large torchlight parade.  In [[German federal election, December 1924|1924]], he was elected to the Reichstag as a representative of the [[National Socialist Freedom Movement|NSFB]] (a coalition of the German {{lang|de|Völkisch}} Freedom Party ([[German Völkisch Freedom Party|DVFP]]) and members of the Nazi Party), serving until 1928. At around this time, he founded the Tannenberg League, a German nationalist organisation which was both anti-Semitic and anti-Catholic, and published literature espousing conspiracy theories involving Jews, Catholics &amp;ndash; especially [[Jesuit]]s &amp;ndash; and [[Freemasons]].&lt;ref name=evans201&gt;[[Richard J. Evans|Evans, Ricjard J.]] (2003) ''The Coming of the Third Reich'' New York: Penguin. pp.201-02 {{isbn|0-14-303469-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As his views became more extreme under the influence of his wife, [[Mathilde von Kemnitz]], Ludendorff gradually began to part company with Hitler, who was surreptitiously working to undermine the reputation of his one serious rival for the leadership of the extreme right in Germany.  Nonetheless, Ludendorff was persuaded to run for President of the Republic in the [[German presidential election, 1925|March 1925 election]] as the Nazi Party candidate, receiving only a pitiful 1.1 per cent of the vote; there is some evidence that Hitler himself persuaded Ludendorff to run, knowing that the results would be humiliating.&lt;ref name=evans201 /&gt; 

No one had a majority in the initial round of the election, so a second round was needed; Hindenburg entered the race and was narrowly elected. Ludendorff was so humiliated by what he saw as a betrayal by his old friend that he broke off relations with Hindenburg, and in 1927 refused to even stand beside the field marshal at the dedication of the [[Tannenberg memorial]].  He attacked Hindenburg abusively for not having acted in a "nationalistic soldier-like fashion". The Berlin-based liberal newspaper {{lang|de|[[Vossische Zeitung]]}} states in its article "Ludendorff's hate tirades against Hindenburg — Poisonous gas from Hitler's camp" that Ludendorff was, as of 29 March 1930, deeply grounded in Nazi ideology.&lt;ref name="Ludendorff beschimpft Hindenburg"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dfg-viewer.de/demo/viewer/?set%5Bimage%5D=2&amp;set%5Bzoom%5D=min&amp;set%5Bdebug%5D=0&amp;set%5Bdouble%5D=0&amp;set%5Bmets%5D=http%3A%2F%2Fzbw.eu%2Fbeta%2Fp20%2Fperson%2F7861%2F0437%2Fabout.de.xml |title=Ludendorff beschimpft Hindenburg | accessdate=28 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tipton notes that Ludendorff was a [[social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] who believed that war was the "foundation of human society," and that military dictatorship was the normal form of government in a society in which every resource must be mobilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Modern Germany | author=Frank B. Tipton | year=2003| page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Margaret L. Anderson]] notes that after the war, Ludendorff wanted Germany to go to war against all of Europe, and that he became a pagan worshipper of the Nordic god [[Wōden|Wotan]] (Odin); he detested not only [[Judaism]], but also [[Christianity]], which he regarded as a weakening force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Margaret Lavinia Anderson |title=Dying by the Sword. The Fall of the Hohenzollern and Habsburg Empires" from History 167b, ''The Rise and Fall of the Second Reich'' |date=5 December 2007 |url=http://history.berkeley.edu/faculty/Anderson/H167B/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement and death==
Ludendorff divorced and married  his second wife [[Mathilde von Kemnitz]] (1877–1966) in 1926. They published books and essays to prove that the world's problems were the result of Christianity, especially the [[Jesuits]] and [[Catholics]], but also conspiracies by Jews and the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]]. They founded the {{lang|de|[[:de:Bund für Deutsche Gotterkenntnis|Bund für Gotteserkenntnis]]}} {{de icon}} (Society for the Knowledge of God), a small and rather obscure [[esotericism|esoterical]] society of [[Theism|Theists]] that survives to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ludendorff.info/Wichtigste/englisch.htm |title=The God-cognition by Mathilde Ludendorff (1877–1966) |publisher=Bund für Gotterkenntnis Ludendorff e.V. |accessdate=20 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007225053/http://www.ludendorff.info/Wichtigste/englisch.htm |archivedate=7 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He launched several abusive attacks on his former superior Hindenburg for not having acted in a "nationalistic soldier-like fashion".

By the time Hitler came to power, Ludendorff was no longer sympathetic to him. The Nazis distanced themselves from Ludendorff because of his eccentric [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].&lt;ref&gt;David Nicholls, ''Adolf Hitler: A Biographical Companion'', ABC-CLIO, 1 January 2000, p.159.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 30 January 1933, the occasion of Hitler's appointment as Chancellor by President Hindenburg, Ludendorff sent the following telegram to Hindenburg: 

{{quote|I solemnly prophesy that this accursed man will cast our Reich into the abyss and bring our nation to inconceivable misery. Future generations will damn you in your grave for what you have done.&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw, Ian. ''Hitler''. Longman, 1991, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Some historians consider this text to be a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|de|Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte. [http://www.ifz-muenchen.de/heftarchiv/1999_4.pdf 47. Jahrgang, Oktober 1999]}} (PDF; 7&amp;nbsp;MB), S. 559–562.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to regain Ludendorff's favor, Hitler arrived unannounced at Ludendorff's home on his 70th birthday in 1935 to promote him to field marshal. Infuriated, Ludendorff allegedly rebuffed Hitler by telling him: "An officer is named General Field-Marshal on the battlefield!  Not at a birthday tea-party in the midst of peace."&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, 1978, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote two further books on military themes, demonstrating that he still could think coherently about war despite his political and social prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ludendorff |first1=Erich |title=The nation at war |date=1936 |publisher=Hutchinson |location=London |translator=A.S. Rappoport }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludendorff died of [[liver cancer]] in the private clinic {{lang|de|Josephinum}} in Munich, on 20 December 1937 at the age of 72.&lt;ref&gt;Ludendorffs Verlag: ''Der letzte Weg des Feldherrn Erich Ludendorff'', München 1938, S.&amp;nbsp;8: Das Kranken- und Sterbezimmer im Josephinum in München.&lt;/ref&gt; He was given — against his explicit wishes — a state funeral organized and attended by Hitler, who declined to speak at his eulogy. He was buried in the {{lang|de|Neuer Friedhof}} in [[Tutzing]] in [[Bavaria]].

'''Feminist views on [[BDSM]]''' vary widely from rejection to acceptance. BDSM refers to bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and Sado-Masochism. In order to evaluate its perception, two polarizing frameworks are compared. Some feminists, such as [[Andrea Dworkin]] and [[Susan Griffin]], have stated that they regard [[BDSM]] as a form of [[violence against women|woman-hating violence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffen|first=Susan|title="Sadomasochism and the Erosion of Self:A Critical Reading of Story of O" in [[Against Sadomasochism: A Radical Feminist Analysis]]|year=1982|location=East Palo Alto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|title=Woman Hating|year=1974|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other feminists, such as [[Gayle Rubin]] and [[Patrick Califia]], perceive BDSM as a valid form of expression of [[human female sexuality|female sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Jaclyn|title=Yes Means Yes: Visions of Female Sexual Power and a World without Rape|year=2008|publisher=Seal Press|location=Seattle|isbn=1-58005-257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some lesbian feminists practice BDSM and regard it as part of their sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sana Loue |author2=Martha Sajatovic |author3=Keith B. Armitage |title=Encyclopedia of Women's Health|year=2004|pages=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical relationship between feminists and BDSM practitioners has been controversial.  The two most extreme positions reflect those who believe that feminism and BDSM are mutually exclusive beliefs, and those who believe that BDSM practices are a fundamental expression of sexual freedom. Much of the controversy is left over from the [[feminist sex wars]] (acrimonious debates over sex issues) and the battle between the [[Anti-pornography feminism|anti-pornography feminists]] and the [[pro-sex feminist|pro-pornography feminists]].

== History ==

=== 1970s ===
In the 1970s, many different divisions of the feminist movement emerged.   As Andrew McBride writes, "During the 1970s, much of the discourse in the feminist movement was dominated by discussions of [[lesbian feminism]]. Toward the end of the decade, however, the conversations within feminism began to focus on a new topic: sexuality. This included sexuality of all types, not just lesbian sexuality. Included in the discussions and debates were heterosexuality, pornography, sadomasochism, butch/femme roles, and sex work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McBride|first=Andrew|title=Lesbian History:  The Sex Wars|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/lesbian.history/the_sex_wars|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lavender Menace]] and their concept of [[The Woman-Identified Woman|the woman identified woman]] and the [[Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media]] both came out strongly believing that engaging in BDSM play was contradictory to being a feminist. [[Samois]], a San Francisco-based lesbian BDSM group, maintained that feminists could engage in BDSM without being hypocritical.

=== 1980s ===
During the 80s, this sex war continued and reached the attention of several academics who attempted to dissect why such a division had occurred. Ardill and O'Sullivan explained the history using the conflict in the [[London Lesbian and Gay Centre|London Lesbian and Gay Center]] as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ardill|first=S|author2=O'Sullivan, S|title=Upsetting an applecart: Difference, desire and lesbian sadomasochism|journal=Feminist Review|year=2005|volume=80|pages=98–126|doi=10.1057/palgrave.fr.9400223}}&lt;!--|accessdate=8 May 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar conflicts were continuations of the issues in the 1970s.
The [[Lesbian Sex Mafia]] founded by [[Dorothy Allison]] appeared in New York advocating [[sex positive feminism]] and promoting the idea that all women had the right to explore their sexuality in whatever ways they saw fit. The controversial [[1982 Barnard Conference on Sexuality]], which brought these issues to the attention of academic feminists, is often regarded as officially launching the feminist sex wars.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Elizabeth|date=1983-01-01|title=The Context of 'Between Pleasure and Danger': The Barnard Conference on Sexuality|jstor=1394680|journal=Feminist Review|issue=13|pages=35–41|doi=10.2307/1394680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1990s ===
In the 1990s feminist scholars continued to research and apply different feminist academic [[:wikt:framework|frameworks]] to the questions of sexuality and BDSM in an effort to find a way to bridge the gap between the two groups.  Hopkins, in 1994 applied critical analysis to the feminist viewpoints against Sadomasochistic acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=P.D.|title=Rethinking sadomasochism: Feminism, interpretation and simulation|journal=Hypatia|year=1994|volume=9|issue=1|page=116|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1994.tb00112.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She takes each argument put forth against BDSM practice by women and answers it from within a feminist framework.   In the end, she points out that the issue is not as concrete as feminists may try and paint it and that they may need to examine the concepts in more detail.    In 1995, Teresa Hornsby also applied feminist frameworks to the subject of BDSM and came down on the side that the two were not contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hornsby|first=Teresa|title=Gender role reversal and the violated lesbian body: Toward a feminist hermeneutic of lesbian sadomasochism|journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies|year=1999|volume=3|issue=3|pages=61–72|doi=10.1300/j155v03n03_06}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Hornsby went further to examine whether or not violence itself was only a masculine activity.

=== 2000s ===
After 2000, advances in technology were opening up the world to more people and BDSM started coming out more and more in popular culture.  [http://law.uvic.ca/faculty_staff/faculty_directory/deckha.php Maneesha Deckha] applied a [[postcolonial feminist]] approach where she suggests treating BDSM as a cultural practice as a means to put to rest the divide between feminists and BDSM practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deckha|first=Maneesha|title=Pain as culture: A postcolonial feminist approach to S/M and women’s agency.|journal=Sexualities|year=2011|volume=14|issue=2|doi=10.1177/1363460711399032}}&lt;/ref&gt; She came to the conclusion as did those in the 90's that perhaps a more in depth look is needed to determine if feminist viewpoints on BDSM hold up under closer scrutiny.     In addition, Deckha did some work on the concepts of consent and the legality of BDSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deckha|first=Maneesha|title=Pain, pleasure, and consenting women: Exploring feminist responses to S/m and its legal regulation in Canada through [[Elfriede Jelinek|Jelinek's]] ''[[The Piano Teacher (Jelinek novel)|The Piano Teacher]]''.|journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender|year=2007|volume=30|issue=2|pages=425–459}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically addressing the question on whether or not women can give consent and whether BDSM activities should be regulated in the context of violence or the context of sexuality.  One point she makes is if legislation is made in the context of regulating it around sex then aren't we simply giving the patriarchy further control over women's expression of sexual identity.

=== Current feminist viewpoints ===
Current feminist viewpoints on BDSM practices continue to be controversial and at odds with one another. Some feminists view SM as an ideal feminist expression of sexual freedom while other feminists say that BDSM, and more particularly SM, reinforce patriarchy and that these practices are contradictory to feminism. Feminists who view BDSM as contradictory to feminism also often believe that women who engage in BDSM practices, and specifically those who play a submissive role in them, have been led by sexist power structures to believe that they enjoy these acts. This feminist viewpoint argues that the individuals who enjoy playing a submissive role in the bedroom only enjoy it because they have been led to believe that it is what is expected of them and that they should enjoy it. This viewpoint argues that if these individuals, particularly women, were able to explore their sexual desires without the influence of a sexist power structure that they would come to very different conclusions about what they enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deckha|first=Maneesha|title=Pain as a Culture: A Postcolonial Feminist Approach to S/M and Women's Agency|journal=Sexualities|year=2011|volume=14|issue=129|doi=10.1177/1363460711399032}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 May 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perspectives on lesbian BDSM ===
Lesbian SM (Sadism, Submission, Masochism) has been problematic in the analysis of feminist viewpoints on BDSM, especially with regards to whether or not lesbians are recreating patriarchal structures.    Many academic critics do not even tackle the idea of lesbian BDSM. Maneesha Deckha in her article, "Pain, pleasure, and consenting women: Exploring feminist responses to S/M and its legal regulation in Canada through [[Elfriede Jelinek|Jelinek's]] ''[[The Piano Teacher (Jelinek novel)|The Piano Teacher]]'' admitted that covering lesbian BDSM made her theories too convoluted to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deckha|first=M.|title=Pain, pleasure, and consenting women: Exploring feminist responses to S/m and its legal regulation in Canada through Jelinek's the piano teacher|journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender|year=2007|volume=30|series=2|pages=425–459|accessdate=5 February 2012|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlg/vol302/425-460_Deckha.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such lesbian erasure has been fairly common in second and third wave feminism as lesbian identity has frequently been subsumed in feminist identity. This concept is explained by Calhoun in "The Gender Closet: Lesbian disappearance under the sign 'woman'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calhoun|first=C|title=gender closet: Lesbian disappearance under the sign `women'|journal=Feminist Studies|year=1995|volume=21|series=1|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some, such as Deckha, believe  that although lesbians do practice BDSM, they are doing so in an effort to merely recreate the patriarchal power structure in the rest of society. Be it through domination and submission exchange of power, or the butch/femme dynamic, lesbians who interact in this way are convincing themselves that they are outside of patriarchy, when in reality they are reinforcing it because their sexuality is trapped within the patriarchal structure, true consent cannot occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deckha|first=Maneesha|title=Pain as culture: A postcolonial feminist approach to S/M and women’s agency|journal=Sexualities|year=2011|volume=14|series=2|pages=129–150|doi=10.1177/1363460711399032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Hornsby, believe that lesbians can in fact practice BDSM without recreating patriarchal systems because they have already declared themselves to be outside of those systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hornsby|first=Teresa|title=Gender role reversal and the violated lesbian body: Toward a feminist hermeneutic of lesbian sadomasochism|journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies|year=1999|volume=3|series=3|pages=61–72|doi=10.1300/j155v03n03_06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BDSM practitioners ===
Feminist writer Clarisse Thorn released a book in 2012 called ''The S&amp;M Feminist,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clarisse Thorn |title=The S&amp;M Feminist | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6D_AMgEACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9781477472040&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4b4fU8bNLYP7kAWYyoDoDA&amp;redir_esc=y | publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2012 | ISBN=978-1477472040}} (Essays on BDSM, gender and culture)&lt;/ref&gt; in which she often discusses her own experiences. The high-profile feminist anthology ''[[Yes Means Yes]],'' published in 2008, also featured an essay about BDSM and feminism by Stacey May Fowles.

Jessica Wakeman wrote of her own experience with SM activities in a follow-up interview after her article [http://www.thefrisky.com/2009-06-01/first-time-for-everything-spanking/ First Time For Everything: Getting Spanked] was published in 2009. At the time of the interview in October, 2010, Wakeman had been writing about feminist issues, including feminism and media criticism, feminism and politics, and feminism and sex for about eight years and considered herself to be a rather active feminist.&lt;ref name =carpm&gt;{{cite web|last=Carpentier|first=Megan|title=BDSM And Feminism: "Stop Telling Me What I’m Supposed To Like, D*mn It."|url=http://jezebel.com/5666107/bdsm-and-feminism-%20stop-telling-me-what-im-supposed-to-like-dmn-it|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wakeman discussed how she is able to enjoy spanking play and being dominated and still be a feminist. She discussed how spanking play is a fetish and is no different from other fetishes that individuals have, even though it does involve being hit by one's partner. She also commented that it is important to remember that when an individual is involved with BDSM play, such as spanking, if it is true BDSM play it has been discussed by both partners and either of them can stop the play at any time with a safe word. Furthermore, a real physically or emotionally abusive relationship is not safe and consensual like BDSM play is. There is a difference between what happens in the bedroom and what happens in real life. Wakeman wrote that she is able to enjoy things in the context of sex or flirting that she wouldn't want to happen in her day-to-day life.&lt;ref name =carpm/&gt;

Like other feminist BDSM practitioners, Wakeman rejects the argument that women are taught what they enjoy and led to be submissive by a dominant sexist power structure. Within BDSM communities, it is often said that submissive practitioners are the real dominants because they have the ultimate control over the situation with a safe word.&lt;ref name =carpm/&gt;

The '''flag of Florida''' consists of a red [[saltire]] on a white background, with the [[Seal of Florida|state seal]] superimposed on the center. The design was approved by popular referendum November 6, 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.fsu.edu/crc/conhist/1900amen.html|title=Amendments, Election of 11-6-1900|author=Florida Constitution Revision Commission|publisher=The Florida State University|date=August 4, 2005|accessdate=March 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag's current design has been in use since May 21, 1985, after the state seal was graphically altered and officially sanctioned for use by state officials.

In 2001, a survey conducted by the [[North American Vexillological Association]] (NAVA) placed [[Florida]]'s flag 34th in design quality out of the 72 Canadian provincial, U.S. state and U.S. territorial flags ranked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nava.org/digital-library/design/surveys/2001-State-Provincial-Flag-Survey.pdf|title=2001 State/Provincial Flag Survey  - NAVA.org|work=nava.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Spanish period===
[[File:Great Assembly of the States-General in 1651 01.jpg|thumb|Burgundian saltires at the [[States General of the Netherlands|Assembly of the States General]], 1651.]]

[[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] was a dynastic union and federation of kingdoms when [[Juan Ponce de León]] claimed [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] on April 2, 1513. Several banners or standards were used during the first period of settlement and governance in Florida, such as the royal standard of the [[Crown of Castile]] in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pensapedia.com/wiki/City_of_Five_Flags |title=City of Five Flags |accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cross of Burgundy flag|Cross of Burgundy]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]. As with other Spanish territories, the Burgundian saltire was generally used in Florida to represent collective Spanish sovereignty between 1513 and 1821.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flheritage.com/facts/symbols/flagdetails.cfm?id=3 |title=Florida's Historic Flags |accessdate=2012-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1763, Spain passed control of Florida to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] via the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]]. Great Britain used the [[Flag of Great Britain|original union flag]] with the white diagonal stripes in Florida during this brief period. The British also divided the Florida territory into [[East Florida]], with its capital at St. Augustine, and [[West Florida]], with its capital at Pensacola. The border was the [[Apalachicola River]].

Spain regained control of Florida in [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783]]. In 1785, [[Charles III of Spain#Birth of a nation|King Charles III]] chose a new [[Flag of Spain|naval and battle flag]] for Spain, which was now a more centralized nation-state, and its territories. This flag, a tri-band of red-gold-red, was used along with the Burgundian saltire in the provinces of East and West Florida until 1821, when the Florida provinces joined the United States.

===American Civil War===
Between 1821 and 1861, Florida had no official flag. {{cns|date=May 2018|text=The Lone Star and Stripes, previously the [[Flag of Texas|Naval Ensign of Texas]], was used as a provisional flag between 1861 and 1868,}} after Florida seceded from the [[United States|Union]] and declared itself a "sovereign and independent nation",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.floridamemory.com/exhibits/floridahighlights/secession/ |title=Ordinance of Secession, 1861 (From: Florida Convention of the People, Ordinance of Secession, 1861, Series S972) |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaffirming the preamble in the Constitution of 1838. This flag was also used when Floridian forces took control of U.S. forts and a navy yard in Pensacola. Col. William H. Chase was Commander of Floridian troops and the flag is also referred to as the Chase Flag. Later in the year the [[Florida Legislature]] passed a law authorizing Governor Perry to design an official flag. His design was the tri-band of the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] but with the blue field extending down and the new seal of Florida within the blue field.

As a member of the Confederacy, Florida saw use of all three versions of the Confederate flag. The [[Bonnie Blue Flag]], previously the flag of the short-lived [[Republic of West Florida]], was briefly used as an unofficial [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|flag of the Confederacy]]. It features a single five-point star centered in a blue background.

Between 1868 and 1900, the flag of Florida was simply the state seal on a white background. In a discrepancy,  however, a later version of the state seal depicts a steamboat with a white flag that includes a red saltire, similar to Florida's current flag. In the late 1890s, [[Governor of Florida|Governor]] [[Francis P. Fleming]] advocated that [[saltire|St. Andrew's Cross]] be added so that it would not appear to be a [[white flag]] of truce hanging still on a flagpole. Floridians approved the addition of St. Andrew's Cross by popular referendum in 1900.&lt;ref name=16Flags&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/contentViewer.aspx?category=PublicGuide&amp;file=About%20Florida%20--%20Flags%20of%20Florida.html |title=Florida House of Representatives - About Florida – Flags of Florida |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The red saltire of the [[Cross of Burgundy]] represents the cross on which St. Andrew was crucified, and the standard can be frequently seen in Florida's historic settlements, such as [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dma.myflorida.com/first-muster/ |title=First Muster - Florida Department of Military Affairs|accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, some historians see the addition of a red saltire as a commemoration of Florida's contributions to the Confederacy by Governor Fleming, who served in the 2nd Florida Regiment of the Confederate army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Governor Francis Philip Fleming|url=http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_florida/col2-content/main-content-list/title_fleming_francis.html|publisher=National Governors Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The addition was made during a period of nostalgia for the "[[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause]]" around the time of the flag's change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Dave|title=Flag debate spreading across Deep South|url=http://savannahnow.com/stories/091700/LOCflaginsight.shtml#.VaunxRNVhBd|accessdate=19 July 2015|work=Savannah Morning News|date=17 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ingraham|first1=Christopher|title=How the Confederacy lives on in the flags of seven Southern states|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/06/21/how-the-confederacy-lives-on-in-the-flags-of-seven-southern-states/|accessdate=19 July 2015|work=Washington Post|date=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian John M.

[[File:Sir_George_Etienne_Cartier_Monument,_Montreal.jpg|thumb|The George-Étienne Cartier Monument in Mount Royal Park, Montreal]]
The '''Sir George-Étienne Cartier Monument'''  is a monument in [[Mount Royal#Mount Royal Park|Mount Royal Park]] to [[George-Étienne Cartier]] by sculptor [[George William Hill (sculptor)|George William Hill]] (1862–1934).
[[File:Monument G E Cartier Est.JPG|thumb|left|The ''George-Étienne Cartier'' statue on the monument]]
The monument, which is topped by a winged [[Liberty (goddess)|Goddess of Liberty]], was inaugurated on September 6, 1919 in the heart of Fletcher's Field west side. In temperate months it is the site of free weekly drum circle festivals informally called [[Tam-Tams]].&lt;ref name="cartier"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=9d571f9c-ad2e-44f0-b106-138ef2ea32a3|title=Cartier returns|date=May 23, 2008|work=[[Montreal Gazette]]|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the front, or East side of the monument, George-Étienne Cartier is portrayed standing above four other figures, each one representing a Province that signed the [[Canadian Confederation|Canadian Confederation of 1867]]. 

On the North side of the monument, a woman with a young girl to her right and a young boy to her left is shown holding a sword in her left hand. The boy holds out his bonded wrists in a begging manner as the girl reads a book. This scene represents [[Canadian legislation|Legislation]].

On the South side, in a similar scene to the North side, a woman sits in the middle of a young boy who is holding a ball and a young girl who is reading a book. This represents Cartier's important contributions in education.

==Migration by the numbers==

According to the 2010 US Census, the Guatemalan-born population totaled 1,044,209 people, comprising 2.1% of the overall immigrant population of the US, and making Guatemala the 10th highest sender of immigrants in the US.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;U.S. Census Bureau, “The Hispanic Population: 2010,” Hispanic or Latino Origin Population by Type: 2000 and 2010 Table 1. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2011/dec/c2010br-04.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;. (Accessed Feb 11, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

Up until the 1960s, Guatemalan migration to the US was negligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2016/table1|title=Table 1.

This shows that even though ''legal'' migration may have slowed, migration as a whole from the country is on the rise.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Very few Guatemalans have furthermore been granted citizenship.

Martin and Pia Orrenius (eds.). Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, despite a recent spike in asylum claims, according to a [http://cmsny.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/CMS-Cristosal-Report-final.pdf 2017 report] by the Center for Migration Studies, many Guatemalans with legitimate claims of persecution are being rejected and deported back to the situations of violence from which they had fled.&lt;ref&gt;''Point of No Return: The Fear and Criminalization of Central American Refugees.''

Furthermore, as many Guatemalans must claim their need for asylum at the border with minimal to no legal support in developing their claim, it is extremely difficult to win cases and many end up being subject to removal.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Jacobs and Andrew Schoenholtz. “The State of Asylum Representation: Ideas for Change.” ''Georgetown Immigration Law Journal'' 16 (2002): 739.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the clear violence that more recent Guatemalan immigrants are fleeing (in 2014, Guatemala had the 9th highest murder rate in the world with 31.2 murders/100,000 residents) and the recent skyrocketing of asylum claims, the asylum grant rate has remained at an outrageously low 3-5%.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

Fearful of this reality, many who can, end up entering the US via what the immigration theorist Philip Martin calls the "back door" route—entering unauthorized.&lt;ref name="Philip L Martin 2014"/&gt; In fact, Pew Hispanic cites that in 2015, unauthorized migration made up the majority (56%) of Guatemalan migration, approximating 550,000 unauthorized Guatemalan immigrants that year.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Some Guatemalans have qualified for the program of [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals|Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)]] since the Obama Administration instituted it in 2012, but Pew Hispanic estimates that only about 17,700 Guatemalans satisfied the requirements to receive DACA status, which is currently being contested by the Trump administration.

==Geographic destinations ==
Guatemalans have primarily settled in California, Florida and Texas. As of 2015, 29% of Guatemalans in the US lived in California while 8% respectively lived in Florida and Texas.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Within California, Guatemalans are concentrated in Los Angeles (20%).&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Within these cities, ethnic enclaves and already-present communities help receive new migrants, connecting them with jobs and easing the transition, thus decreasing the linguistic and cultural costs of migration.

'''''How Do You Spell God?: Answers to the Big Questions from Around the World''''' is a book on religion by [[Rabbi Marc Gellman]] and [[Msgr. Thomas Hartman]] of ''[[The God Squad (Telecare)|The God Squad]]'', which answers questions about different religions. Each chapter's title is a question about any religion in general; for example, one chapter asks "What are some of the bad things in religions?", another asks "What question does each religion want to answer the most?", and another asks "What's a religion?".

== Foreword ==

A prologue written by the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] introduces us to the book itself, and he tells people what to expect as they read it. He describes the connection between religion and happiness, and the importance of peace and tolerance in the world among people of different faiths.

== Consumer Warning! ==

Rabbi Gellman and Msgr. Hartman give the reader a warning that if he/she takes religion very seriously, and if it seems to be disrespectful or funny in the wrong way, then it's the wrong book, and that their intent is to be serious and funny.

== Response ==
The book was recognized with the [[Christopher Award]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wchstv.com/abc/gma/godsquad.shtml Rabbi Marc Gellman and Msgr. Thomas Hartman: The God Squad on Good Morning America], [[WCHS-TV]], accessed April 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors were featured as animated characters in an [[HBO]] special based on the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3617/is_199611/ai_n8754105 "Heads up!: TV tips"], ''NEA Today'', November 1996, accessed April 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Individualist feminism''', sometimes also grouped with '''libertarian feminism''', is [[Feminism|feminist]] ideas which emphasize [[individualism]].&lt;ref name="About_ALF"&gt;{{cite web | title = About ALF - The Association of Libertarian Feminists  | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090828170220/http://alf.org/aboutalf/founding.shtml | archive-date = August 28, 2009 | url = http://alf.org/aboutalf/founding.shtml | website = alf.org | publisher = Association of Libertarian Feminists }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General ==

Individualist feminists attempt to change legal systems to eliminate class privileges and gender privileges and to ensure that individuals have equal rights, including an equal claim under the law to their own persons and property. Individualist feminism encourages women to take full responsibility for their own lives. It also opposes any government interference into the choices adults make with their own bodies because, it contends, such interference creates a coercive hierarchy (such as [[patriarchy]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

'''[[Iron]]''' has a long and varied tradition in the mythology and folklore of the world.

==In Europe==
===Cold iron===
{{redirect|Cold Iron|the poem by Rudyard Kipling|Cold Iron (poem)}}
'''Cold iron''' is a poetic term for [[iron]].

[[Francis Grose|Francis Grose's]] ''1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'' defines cold iron as "A sword, or any other weapon for cutting or stabbing." This usage often appears as "cold steel" in modern parlance.

[[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem "[[Cold Iron (poem)|Cold Iron]]", found in his 1910 collection of stories ''[[Rewards and Fairies]]'', used the term poetically to mean "weapon".

"Cold iron" is historically believed to repel, contain, or harm [[ghost]]s, [[fairy|fairies]], [[witch]]es, and other malevolent [[supernatural]] creatures.  This belief continued into later [[superstition]]s in a number of forms:

* Nailing an iron [[horseshoe]] to a [[door]] was said to repel [[evil spirit]]s or later, to bring good luck.
* Surrounding a [[cemetery]] with an iron [[fence]] was thought to contain the [[soul]]s of the [[dead]].
* Burying an iron [[knife]] under the entrance to one's [[house|home]] was alleged to keep [[witch]]es from entering.

In his novel ''[[Redgauntlet]]'', the [[Scotland|Scottish]] author [[Sir Walter Scott]] wrote, "Your wife's a witch, man; you should nail a horse-shoe on your chamber-door."

In modern fantasy, cold iron may refer to a special type of metal, such as meteoric iron or unworked metal. Weapons and implements made from cold iron are often granted special efficacy against creatures such as fairies and spirits.

===Horseshoes===
[[File:Horseshoe lucky on door.jpg|thumb|upright|A horseshoe on a door is regarded as a protective [[amulet|talisman]] in some cultures.]]

[[Horseshoe]]s are considered a good [[luck]] charm in many cultures, including those of England, Denmark,&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, Benjamin (1851). ''Northern Mythology: Comprising the Principal Popular Traditions and Superstitions of Scandinavia, North Germany, and the Netherlands''. E. Lumley.&lt;/ref&gt; Lithuania, and Estonia, and its shape, fabrication, placement and manner of sourcing are all important. A common tradition is that if a horseshoe is hung on a door with the two ends pointing up (as shown here) then good luck will occur. However, if the two ends point downwards then bad luck will occur. Traditions do differ on this point, though. In some cultures, the horseshoe is hung ''points down'' (so the luck pours onto you); in others, it is hung ''points up'' (so the luck does not fall out); still in others it does not matter so long as the horseshoe has been used (not new), was found (not purchased), and can be touched. In all traditions, luck is ''contained'' in the shoe and can ''pour out'' through the ends.

In some traditions, any good or bad luck achieved will only occur to the ''owner'' of the horseshoe, not the person who hangs it up. Therefore, if the horseshoe was stolen, borrowed or even just found then the ''owner'', not the person who found or stole the horseshoe will get any good or bad luck. Other traditions require that the horseshoe be found to be effective.

[[File:Horseshoe and devil.svg|thumb|right|upright|Illustration by [[George Cruikshank]] for ''The True Legend of St. Dunstan and the Devil'']]
One reputed origin of the tradition of lucky horseshoes is the story of [[Dunstan|Saint Dunstan]] and the Devil. Dunstan, who would become the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in AD 959, was a blacksmith by trade. The story relates that he once nailed a horseshoe to the Devil's hoof when he was asked to reshoe the Devil's horse. This caused the Devil great pain, and Dunstan only agreed to remove the shoe and release the Devil after the Devil promised never to enter a place where a horseshoe is hung over the door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The True Legend of St. Dunstan and the Devil: Showing How the Horse-Shoe Came to Be a Charm Against Witchcraft |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13978 |author=Edward G. Flight |location=London |year=1871 |edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory concerning the placing of horseshoes above doorways is to ward off [[Faeries]]; the theory being that supernatural beings are repelled by iron and as horseshoes were an easily available source of iron, they could be nailed above a door to prevent any unwanted, otherworldly guests.

==Meteoric iron in Tibet==
'''''[[Thogcha]]''''' ({{bo|t=ཐོག་ལྕགས|w=thog lcags}})&lt;ref&gt;Bellezza, John Vincent (March, 1999). ''Thogchags: The Ancient Amulets of Tibet.'' Source: [http://www.asianart.com/articles/thogchags/index.html] (accessed: Wednesday April 14, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; means 'sky-iron' in Tibetan.  [[Meteoric iron]] was highly prized throughout the Himalayas where it was included in sophisticated polymetallic alloys for ritual implements such as the [[singing bowl]] (Jansen, 1992) and [[phurba]] (Müller-Ebeling, ''et al.'', 2002).

Beer (1999: p.&amp;nbsp;234) holds that:

{{quote|Meteoric iron or "sky-iron" (Tib. gnam lcags) is the supreme substance for forging the physical representation of the [[vajra]] or other iron weapons, since it has already been tempered by the celestial gods in its passage across the heavens.  The indivisibility of form and emptiness is a perfect metaphor for the image of a meteorite or "stone fallen from the sky", manifesting out of the voidness of space as a shooting star or fireball, and depositing a chunk of fused "sky iron" on the earth below. Many vajras held by deities as weapons are described as being forged from meteorite iron, and Tibet, with its high altitude, thin atmosphere and desolate landscape, received an abundance of meteorite fragments. Tibetan vajras were often cast from meteorite iron, and as an act of sympathetic magic a piece of the meteoric iron was often returned to its original site.&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Robert (1999).

'''John "Grizzly" Adams''' ([[Pseudonym|also known as]] '''James Capen Adams''' and '''Grizzly Adams''') (1812–1860) was a famous California [[mountain man]] and trainer of [[grizzly bear]]s and other wild animals he captured for [[menagerie]]s, [[zoological gardens]] and [[circus]]es. When Theodore H. Hittell&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1860&lt;/ref&gt; met Adams in 1856 at Adams' Mountaineer Museum in San Francisco, California, Adams first represented himself as William Adams,&lt;ref&gt;Daily Alta&lt;/ref&gt; then a short time later told Hittell (also incorrectly) his name was James Capen Adams, an alias he maintained until 1860. He also told Hittell he was born on October 20, 1807, in Maine.&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1860, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, pp. 9-12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s the motion picture ''[[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]]'' starring [[Dan Haggerty]] was released. An NBC TV series of the same name starring Haggerty followed. Eventually the Grizzly Adams brand was trademarked by the film and television series creator Charles E. Sellier, Jr. The trademark is now owned by Grizzly Adams, LLC, based in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.

Sellier's 1970s movie and TV series used the same "James Capen Adams" name incorrectly conveyed by Hittell. The real John Adams did not have a middle name. His mother's maiden surname was "Capen". He did, however, actually have a younger brother named James Capen Adams.&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, pp. 155-156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p 569&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, pp. 9-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McClung, pp. 11 and 192&lt;/ref&gt;  Information on his Massachusetts death record (Vol. 139, p.&amp;nbsp;225) also indicates that his name was John and gives an estimated birth year of 1813, based on age at death (48 years). His tombstone lists his first name as John and his date of death as October 25, 1860, age 48 years.&lt;ref name="Find a Grave"&gt;{{Find a Grave|3|John "Grizzly" Adams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Grizzly Adams was of English ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, pp. 568-9&lt;/ref&gt; Born and raised in [[Medway, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;Hayden, ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; a suburb of [[Boston]], he received little to no education. Adams began as an apprentice in the footwear manufacturing industry at age fourteen.  &lt;ref&gt;Adams&lt;/ref&gt;  At age twenty-one, he left that occupation, seeking to satisfy his true love - the outdoors and nature. He signed on with a company of showmen as a zoological collector. John hunted and captured live wild animals in the wildest parts of [[Maine]], [[Vermont]] and [[New Hampshire]], where he honed his woodsman, survival, and marksmanship skills. However, Adams told Hittell, his hunting and trapping career ended abruptly when he received severe back and spine injuries from a Bengal tiger he was attempting to train for his employers.&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1911, pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  Not wanting to become a burden on his family, after a year of recuperating he returned to his [[Shoemaking|cobbler’s]] bench in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1836, John married Cylena Drury and they had three children: Arabella, Arathusa, and Seymour.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 661&lt;/ref&gt;

==California and Western States, 1849–1860==
In 1849 with the [[California Gold Rush]] in progress, John invested his life savings of over $6,000 to buy a large supply of footwear, and had it shipped to [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. He intended to sell his goods at great profit to the thousands of [[California Gold Rush|forty-niners]] passing through St. Louis. Through no fault of his own, he lost the entire investment in the [[St. Louis Fire (1849)|St. Louis wharf fire]].  Shortly thereafter, John's father committed suicide;&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; - it is possible that he invested heavily in John's scheme. At this point, John felt he had nothing to lose. He had a touch of [[California Gold Rush|gold fever]] and a yearning for adventure. He knew even if he failed to recoup his lost investment in the mines, he could at least support himself by hunting and trapping in the untapped wilds of California. He left his family and relatives behind in [[Massachusetts]] and joined the [[California Gold Rush|49ers]] on their way to California.  On his journey via the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]] and [[Southern Emigrant Trail|Gila]] trails, he twice survived near fatal illnesses and arrived at the gold fields of California late in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams tried his luck at mining, hunting game to sell to the miners, trading, and finally, ranching and farming.  At times he was rich and then, just as quickly, broke.  Late in 1852, having lost his ranch outside of [[Stockton, California]] to creditors, he took the few items he could salvage and headed into the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains to get away from it all.  With the help of the local [[Miwok people|Miwok Indians]], Adams built a cabin and stable and spent the winter alone in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra]].&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1911, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  John was an expert hunter and his [[New England]] training in shoemaking and leather craft gave him the necessary skills to fashion buckskin clothing and moccasins (the clothing he adopted as normal attire for the remainder of his life). He also made his own harness, pack saddles, snowshoes and other items he needed.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

John didn't stay in California all the time. He traveled great distances from his California base camp on foot, on horse or mule, or in an ox-drawn wagon. In 1853, he made a hunting and trapping expedition some 1,200 miles from his base camp in California to eastern [[Washington Territory]] (what is now western [[Montana]]).&lt;ref&gt;Storer, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; While there, he caught a yearling female grizzly that he named Lady Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, pp. 91–106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, P. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Even though she was already a year old and very wild, he managed to tame her and taught her to follow him without restraint.&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1911, pp. 186-7&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he trained her to carry a pack and then to pull a loaded sled. She even cuddled up near John to keep him warm in freezing conditions. Eventually, Lady Washington allowed John to ride on her back.

In 1854, Adams retrieved a pair of two-week-old male grizzly cubs from the den of their mother near [[Yosemite Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1911, pp.191-205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, pp 96-101&lt;/ref&gt;  He named one of them Benjamin Franklin. Ben saved John's life a year later in 1855, when a mother grizzly attacked Adams.&lt;ref&gt;Storer, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hittell|1911|pp= 305}}&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; John and Ben both bore the scars of that attack the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1911, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; The head injury John received in the attack led to his demise five years later. In the summer of 1854, John traveled to the [[Rocky Mountains]] to hunt and collect more live animals.&lt;ref&gt;Storer, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shenk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1911, pp. 266-268&lt;/ref&gt;  He and his hunting companions sold meat, hides and some live animals to the emigrants along the [[Emigrant Trail]]s near where the [[Oregon Trail]] and the [[Mormon Trail]] split away from each other (southwestern Wyoming). They also sold and traded at [[Fort Bridger]], [[Wyoming]] and [[Fort Bridger|Fort Supply]].  During this expedition, Lady Washington had an amorous encounter with a Rocky Mountain grizzly.&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1911, p 279&lt;/ref&gt;  The mating resulted in a male cub that was born the next year when she was with Adams in [[Corral Hollow]] on the eastern side of the [[California Coast Ranges|California coastal mountains]]. Adams christened her cub General Fremont, in honor of [[John C. Fremont]].&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1911, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

In the winter of 1854, Grizzly Adams captured a huge California grizzly in the largest cage trap Adams had ever constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Storer, pp 177-179&lt;/ref&gt;  John named him Samson.{{sfn|Hittell|1911|pp= 305}}&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p.p 139-144&lt;/ref&gt;  When the monster bear was later weighed on a hay scale, it tipped the beam at 1,500 pounds (one of the largest grizzly bears ever captured alive).&lt;ref&gt;Wright, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1855, Adams and his companions hunted and trapped game in the California Coast Range mountains, journeyed to the Kern River mines, then proceeded southward to the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] and [[Tejon Pass (Kern County)|Tejon Pass]]. Returning from the Tejon Pass area, Adams  followed the [[El Camino Real (California)|Old Spanish Route]] via [[Mission San Miguel Arcángel|San Miguel]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1911, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; Due to interest of the curious people the group met, John set up impromptu shows of his bears and other animals he had collected on his summer excursion.  These shows, a precursor to his circus career, were conducted in [[Mission San Miguel Arcángel|San Miguel]], [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], the [[Redwood City, California|redwoods]] and finally San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856, John retrieved all of his animals from [[#Association with Circus People|Howard's Ranch]] near [[Stockton, California]] where he had left them to be cared for while he was absent. He then opened the Mountaineer Museum in a basement on Clay Street in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Due to notices T. H. Hittell printed in the San Francisco daily ''Evening Bulletin'', Adams' show drew many more patrons. Soon thereafter, Adams was able to move his menagerie and museum, now called the Pacific Museum, to a better location. The new building could accommodate larger audiences and house more animals and displays. By 1858, he was referred to as the "Barnum of the Pacific", in a San Francisco newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;''Evening Bulletin'', January 18, 1858&lt;/ref&gt; In January, 1858, tragedy struck when noble Ben, John's favorite grizzly, died of an illness for which no remedy could be found. Adams was devastated at the loss, but continued to show his animals daily. He also continuously added more animals and other attractions to his museum. In 1859, due to such over extensions, he lost his museum building to creditors.  However, he was able to save most of his menagerie, which he relocated temporarily to another building.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

Grizzly Adams' health was deteriorating and he knew his life would soon end. Since he had been away from his wife in [[Massachusetts]] for over ten years, he wanted to earn enough before he died to leave her a comfortable sum.  He made arrangements to relocate his menagerie and collections to New York, in hopes of joining [[Phineas Taylor Barnum|P. T. Barnum]] as a part of his show.&lt;ref&gt;Andronik, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; On January 7, 1860, Adams and his menagerie departed from San Francisco on the clipper ship ''Golden Fleece'' on their way to New York City via [[Cape Horn]], a {{frac|3|1|2}}-month voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

In New York City, Grizzly Adams, still representing himself as James Capen Adams, joined with Barnum to perform his California Menagerie in a canvas tent for six weeks.  His health continued to decline and after a doctor told him he had better settle his affairs, Adams decided he would sell his menagerie to [[Phineas Taylor Barnum|Barnum]]. However, disregarding his doctor's prognosis, he managed to persuade Barnum to agree to let him perform his animals for another ten-weeks for a $500 bonus. Adams' willpower held out for the full contract, though at the end he could hardly walk onto the stage. From the proceeds of the sale of the menagerie and the bonus, he had accomplished his goal of providing a comfortable sum for his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Barnum, pp. 510–513&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
In 1855 Adams suffered head and neck trauma during a grizzly attack in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra]] of California. His scalp was dislodged, and he was left with a silver dollar-sized impression in his skull, just above his forehead. Adams had made pets of several grizzlies, and often wrestled with them while training them and in exhibitions. During one such bout, his most delinquent grizzly, General Fremont (named for [[John C. Fremont]]), struck Adams in the head and reopened the wound. It was subsequently reinjured several times, eventually leaving Adams' brain tissue exposed.

The damage was further exacerbated while Adams was on tour with a circus in [[New England]] during the summer of 1860, when a monkey he was attempting to train purportedly bit into the wound.&lt;ref&gt;Hutching's&lt;/ref&gt; After more than four months performing with his ''California Menagerie'', complications from the injury led to Adams' inability to continue with the show. After completing his contract with [[P. T. Barnum]], he retired to [[Neponset, Massachusetts]], where he died of illness (possibly [[meningitis]]) just five days after arriving at the home of his wife and daughter. Upon hearing of Adams' death, Barnum was deeply grieved. He died October 25, 1860. 

Adams was interred at the Bay Path Cemetery in [[Charlton, Massachusetts]]. It is believed P.T. Barnum commissioned the creation of his tombstone. Also buried there nearby are his mother, father, a sister, his wife, his son and one of his two daughters.&lt;ref name="Find a Grave" /&gt;

==Association with Theodore H. Hittell and Charles C. Nahl==
During Grizzly Adams' exhibition of his grizzly bears and other trained animals in San Francisco, he was working with Hittell from July, 1857 until December 1859.  Hittell listened to Adams narrate his adventures almost daily for an hour or so and took careful notes, cross-questioning Adams to assure he had it straight.  Adams knew, and was apparently flattered by the fact Mr. Hittell intended to write a book based upon Adams' talks.&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1911, Introduction, pp. ix-xiii&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, during this time, the artist [[Charles Christian Nahl|Charles C. Nahl]] took an interest in Adams' grizzlies and, working with Hittell, prepared illustrations (one of which is at the head of this article) that would be used in Hittell's forthcoming book. One of his paintings eventually became the model for the grizzly bear on [[#California's Flag|California's state flag]].&lt;ref&gt;Storer, pp. 276-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/Flags_Over_California.pdf |title=Bear Flag Museum| publisher=BearFlagMuseum.Org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1860, after Adams had relocated to New York, Theodore H. Hittell published his book, ''The Adventures of James Capen Adams, Mountaineer and Grizzly Bear Hunter of California'', in San Francisco,&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1860&lt;/ref&gt; and then later that year, in Boston.

==Association with circus people==
In 1833, John Adams hired on as a wild animal collector with a group of showmen.  Several menageries were active in the New England area at this time, probably the largest was the June, Titus Company's ''National Menagerie'' [[Pseudonym|aka]], ''Grand National Menagerie.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circushistory.org/Thayer/Thayer2b.htm |title=American Circus Anthology, Part Two : General History, A History of the Traveling Menagerie | publisher=CircusHistory.Org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circushistory.org/Thayer/Thayer2a.htm |title=American Circus Anthology, Part Two : General History| publisher=CircusHistory.Org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Boston, Massachusetts was the venue for many such menageries while Adams was living there, so he had the opportunity to meet and interact with the proprietors and performers. There were also circuses and menageries on the Pacific Coast when John reached California, one of which was the Joseph A. Rowe ''Olympic Circus'' that performed in San Francisco and [[Sacramento, California]] at the time he arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circushistory.org/Olympians/OlympiansR2.htm|title=Olympians of the Sawdust Circle, Ro-Ry |publisher=CircusHistory.Org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-adventure.net/land/mining/circus.html|title=Gold Rush Circus |publisher=E-adventure.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On two occasions, Adams told Hittell he had contact with an acquaintance from New England.  This person most likely was in some way connected to the circus/menagerie business.  Adams told Hittell that the man was his brother, "William", although Adams didn't have a brother by that name.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, pp. 568-9&lt;/ref&gt; According to Earle Williams,&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; the property that Adams ranched near [[Stockton, California]] in 1852 was the same land that was later acquired by Henry C. Lee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circushistory.org/Olympians/OlympiansL1.htm |title=Lee, Henry Charles |publisher=CircusHistory.Org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and John R. Marshall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circushistory.org/Olympians/OlympiansM1.htm |title=Marshall, John R. |publisher=CircusHistory.Org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;San Joaquin County Clerk, Stockton, California|1852, Deed Book A, Vol. 4 pp. 62-63&lt;/ref&gt; proprietors of the ''Lee and Marshall Circus.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circusinamerica.org/public/corporate_bodies/public_show/735 |title=Lee and Marshall Circus, 1852-1856 |publisher=CircusinAmerica.Org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lee hired a man by the name of David Howard to run the ranch which was about eight-miles southeast of Stockton, on Mariposa road. Grizzly Adams often left his stock and captured animals at "Howard's Ranch" to be cared for by Howard and Lee's circus people.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;  Lee's circus used the ranch to keep their circus stock, wagons and other items in the circus' winter off-season. According to Williams&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; when Grizzly Adams established his ''Mountaineer Museum'' in San Francisco, in 1856, the menagerie was a part of Lee's Circus, as a ''side show.''  Adams and a couple of his bears appeared with Rowe's ''Pioneer Circus'' in November.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p 205&lt;/ref&gt; In 1857, Adams had a partner named Sheppard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circusinamerica.org/public/corporate_bodies/public_show/285 |title=Shepard and Adams Circus or Adams' California Menagerie |publisher=CircusinAmerica.Org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, T. W. Tanner was a partner with Adams (this may have been the man who owned a half-interest in Adams' ''Pacific Museum,'' prior to Adams leaving for New York in January, 1860).  When Adams arrived in New York City in April 1860, he discovered while talking with P.T. Barnum, that Barnum had bought the one-half interest of Adams' ''California Menagerie,'' (possibly from Tanner). On April 30, 1860, Adams and Barnum opened the ''California Menagerie'' in a canvas tent on the corner of Broadway and Fourth Street in New York City&lt;ref&gt;Barnum, p. 502, et.sec.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andronik, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, pp. 244-7&lt;/ref&gt;  The show ran for six weeks.  Adams health was failing, and he sold the remaining interest in the menagerie to Barnum. Adams then went on a summer tour of Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Hampshire as part of Nixon &amp; Company's Circus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circusinamerica.org/public/corporate_bodies/public_show/147 |title=Nixon &amp; Co.'s Circus|publisher=CircusinAmerica.Org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued to perform with his bears and other trained animals until late October, 1860.

==Ties to the Famous Adams Family of New England==
John Adams was a member of the Adams family of New England that included many important men and women who contributed to the founding and early history of the United States. His great-great-great-great-grandfather, Henry Adams (1583–1646), emigrated with his family from England to Boston, Massachusetts in 1632, and thus established the famous Adams family in America.&lt;ref&gt;Adams&lt;/ref&gt;  Henry's descendants include the patriot, [[Samuel Adams]] and two presidents, [[John Adams]] and President Adams' son, [[John Quincy Adams]].  Grizzly was born in a suburb of Boston, Massachusetts, and was surrounded by relatives and cousins. During Grizzly Adams' childhood, President John Adams lived within a short buggy ride of him in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;McClung P. 187, Note 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCullough Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; John Adams was the third child and first son born to Eleazer Adams (1776–1849) and Sybil (Capen) Adams (1785–1844).&lt;ref&gt;Adams, pp. 568-9&lt;/ref&gt;  He had seven siblings, Susan B., Almy, Charles, James Capen, Zilpha, Francis and Albert.  John married Cylena Drury in 1836.  They had three children: Arabella, Arathusa Elizabeth, and Seymour.  His son, Seymour, never married, so there were no male descendants of Grizzly Adams bearing the Adams surname. John's younger brother, James Capen Adams, (the alias used by "Grizzly" Adams), married and fathered seven children.  Curiously, when Grizzly Adams toured in Connecticut with the circus during the summer of 1860, his brother (the real) James Capen Adams and his family were living in Norfolk, Connecticut at the time.&lt;ref&gt;United States Federal Census, 1860: Place: Norfolk, Litchfield, Connecticut; page: 30, Family 249, lines 25-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In his few years of hunting, John "Grizzly" Adams accomplished astonishing feats. Richard Dillon considers him to be "the greatest California mountain man of them all",&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and McCracken labels him the "Fabulous Mr. 'Grizzly' Adams."&lt;ref&gt;McCracken, Chap. XIV&lt;/ref&gt; Modern hunters with high-powered precision weapons rarely get up close and personal with their game the way Adams did.  He never hesitated to resort to hand-to-paw or knife-to-claw combat when necessary, and he captured more grizzlies alive in those few years than any other man has.&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he captured a wide variety of other wild animals, totaling in the hundreds, for menageries and zoos. Although Grizzly Adams did kill a number of bears, including grizzlies, he did so for food or their furs and hides.  He was not a ''conservationist'' as the term is used in modern times.  He did, however, genuinely love the outdoors, wildlife and unspoiled nature; he hated waste.&lt;ref&gt;McClung, p. viii&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Hall of Fame celebrated Adams' achievements in 1911 with the "Heroes of California" honor.

===Zoological gardens===
His Mountaineer Menagerie was the largest collection of live and mounted animal specimens on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]].  This collection became the Pacific Museum in San Francisco, where he and his animals entertained and educated people from far and wide.  He was referred to as "the Barnum of the Pacific" in an article published in a San Francisco newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;''Evening Bulletin'', January 18, 1858&lt;/ref&gt; His exhibitions also inspired others to campaign for the establishment of zoos, partially resultant of which were the establishment of Woodward's Gardens and, later, the famous [[San Francisco Zoo|Fleishhacker Zoo]] in San Francisco.  On the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], the Zoological Gardens in New York's [[Central Park Zoo|Central Park]] was established in 1860 and in 1899 the [[Bronx Zoo]] was opened.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flag of California===
[[Charles Christian Nahl|Charles C. Nahl]], using Adams' grizzlies as models, made drawings, etchings and paintings of grizzly bears in various scenes. His sketches (including the one at the top of this article) were used to illustrate Hittel's book about Adams.&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1860&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1911&lt;/ref&gt;  Nahl's 1855 painting of a California grizzly portrayed Adams' bear Samson, which the mountain man had brought to San Jose and San Francisco to display that year; this image ended up being the source for the [[Flag of California|California Bear Flag]], for which the official design specifications were put into law in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;Storer, pp. 276-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/Flags_Over_California.pdf |title=Bear Flag Museum| publisher=BearFlagMuseum.Org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation also established the grizzly as [[List of U.S. state mammals|California's state land animal]].

===Observations of grizzlies===
Although not educated as a naturalist in a college or university, Adams learned the habits and facts of grizzly life first-hand through his observations while hunting and trapping them. Because of this, he came to know more about the California grizzly bear than anyone else.&lt;ref&gt;Storer, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; The information that Adams narrated to Hittell was published in the book ''The Adventures of James Capen Adams''.&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1860&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1911&lt;/ref&gt;  His lore has been indispensable to naturalists including Storer&lt;ref&gt;Storer&lt;/ref&gt; and Wright,&lt;ref&gt;Wright&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to historians.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media presentations==
Adams was a famed United States outdoorsman, animal collector/trainer and an owner/performer in his own menagerie and later a partner of [[P. T. Barnum]]'s shows. A biography was published about Adams the year he died.&lt;ref&gt;Hittell 1860&lt;/ref&gt; He was the central character in Charles E. Sellier's 1972 novel ''[[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]].''
As a character in film and television, Adams has been played by:
* [[John Huston]] in ''[[The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean]]'' (1972)
* [[Dan Haggerty]] in ''[[The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams]]'' (1974, 1977–1978, 1982)
* Gene Edwards in ''[[The Legend of Grizzly Adams]]'' (1990)
* Tom Tayback in ''[[Grizzly Adams and the Legend of Dark Mountain]]'' (1999)
* Jeff Watson in ''[[P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3823">'''John Murray Cuddihy''' (January 22, 1922 - April 18, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cuddihy|first=John Murray|title=John Murray Cuddihy|url=http://www.obitsforlife.com/obituary/332118/Cuddihy-John.php|publisher=obitsforlife|accessdate=24 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) was an [[Americans|American]] [[sociologist]]. He was a member of the doctoral faculty at the Graduate School and University Center of the [[City University of New York]] (GSUC).

He is the author of ''No Offense: Civil Religion and Protestant Taste'' (1978) and ''The Ordeal of Civility: Freud, Marx, Lévi-Strauss and the Jewish Struggle with Modernity'' (1974), two books in the [[sociology of religion]]. Cuddihy has been described as a "Catholic atheist,", and "a brilliant yet eccentric critic of contemporary American Jewry".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Berenbaum, ''After Tragedy and Triumph: Essays in Modern Jewish Thought and the American Experience'' (1990), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Cuddihy received his bachelor's degree from St. John's College ([[Annapolis]]), three M.A.s: two from [[Columbia University]] and a third from the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maxweber.hunter.cuny.edu/socio/faculty/cuddi.html Biography] at the [[Hunter College]] Department of Sociology website.&lt;/ref&gt; He took a Ph.D. in Sociology at [[Rutgers University]].

He taught courses in sociological theory, sociology of religion, and the sociology of diaspora Jewry.

== Works ==
His doctoral dissertation was later published, in 1974, as ''The Ordeal of Civility''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moma.org/research/archives/EAD/Motherwellb.html Robert Motherwell Scrapbooks in The Museum of Modern Art Archives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''No Offense: Civil Religion and Protestant Taste'' was published in 1978.

In ''The Ordeal of Civility'', Cuddihy explicates the wrenching process of adjusting to [[modernity]] experienced by the [[shtetl]] [[Jews]] of the [[Pale of Settlement|Pale]] in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries who had to adapt quickly from a [[tribal]] culture to a modern [[Protestant]] civil culture rather than slowly adjusting over the centuries. It is in this context that he locates the efforts of Jewish intellectuals, such as [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] to facilitate the transition by providing a cohesive narrative that attempts to universalize the experience and thus provide an apologia to both the in-group of Jews and the out-group of [[gentiles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,917261,00.html Review by Richard Bernstein NYT 1975]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Cuddihy's "The Ordeal of Civility" |author=Sander L.

In ''No Offense'', a critique of American [[civil religion]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/civilrel.htm Content Pages of the Encyclopedia of Religion and Social Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901214226/http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/civilrel.htm |date=2006-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuddihy argues that Catholic and Jewish intellectuals in America gave up the distinctive religious claims of [[Catholicism]] and Judaism, respectively, in the interests of not offending the Protestant majority. Cuddihy views various intellectual critiques of modernity - both [[conservative]] and [[Political radicalism|radical]] - as the product of [[resentment]] against the more successful, enlightened, Protestant majority.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3651">'''Jopara'''&lt;ref&gt;Lustig, Wolf: Guaraní y ''jopara'' en el Paraguay (http://www.staff.uni-mainz.de/lustig/guarani/art/jopara.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPA-gn|ɟopaˈɾa|Guarani:}} or '''Yopará''' ({{IPA-es|ɟʝopaˈɾa|lang}}) is a colloquial form of [[Guarani language|Guarani]] spoken in [[Paraguay]] which uses a number of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[loan word]]s. Its name is from the Guarani word for "mixture."&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Scott Britton|Britton, A. Scott]] (2004). ''Guarani-English/English-Guarani Concise Dictionary''. New York: [[Hippocrene Books]]. {{ISBN|978-0781810661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Paraguayans, particularly younger ones, speak some form of Jopara.

==Social context==
The relative amount of Guarani or Spanish used in speech varies depending upon the birth of the speakers, the place where they speak, with whom they are speaking, the topic of discussion, and how they want their meaning to be interpreted. Generally, the rural and older population tends to use more Guarani, while the urban and younger population uses more Spanish—the rural and older population ''understands'' more Guarani and the urban and younger more Spanish.  General and every-day conversation is more suited to Guarani, while technical and specific or formal conversation is more suited to Spanish. Guarani can be interpreted as more "Paraguayan" while Spanish can be interpreted as more "sophisticated."

Since 1992, under the Paraguay's Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC) Act, Guarani in its "pure form"—different from the day-to-day speech of Jopara—has been taught in schools. This led to contradictory opinions: some say that teaching pure Guarani is the best means to preserve the language's integrity, while others argue that how Guarani is taught differs greatly from how it is commonly spoken.

==Lexicon==
Many grammatical [[Marker (linguistics)|markers]] for features found in Guarani but not in Spanish, like [[evidentiality]] markers, are borrowed from Guarani. For example (Guarani words in bold):&lt;ref name="Escobar"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/31465435/Escobar_c04SpAmLgsContact.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1513619630&amp;Signature=a%2BKvkyu%2BHmBNkYj4gSSZ7%2BSqyHM%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DEscobar_Anna_Maria._2012._Chapter_4_Span.pdf|chapter=Spanish in Contact with Amerindian Languages|pages=75-77|first=Anna María|last=Escobar|title=The Handbook of Hispanic Linguistics|year=2012|publisher=Blackwell|editor1-first=José Ignacio|editor1-last=Hualde|editor2-first=Anxton|editor2-last=Olarrea|editor3-first=Erin|editor3-last=O'Rourke}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''La niña '''ndaje''' no comía más casi dos días '''voi''' y por eso estaba un poco desnutrida, pero el tua '''ánga''' igual le pegaba'' 
* '''It is said''' that the girl would not eat for more than two days. '''Well,''' for that reason she was somewhat malnourished, but the '''stepfather''' would still hit her.
Some Spanish words, when put in a sentence mixed with Guarani, have a different meaning than that of standard Spanish. They can come from [[calque]]s of equivalent Guarani expressions. For example:&lt;ref name="Escobar"/&gt;
* ''Tu hijo creció '''todo ya'''.''
* Your son grew '''all already'''.

'''Juana María Rodríguez''' is a professor of Ethnic Studies, Gender and Women's Studies, and Performance Studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Her scholarly writing in [[queer theory]], [[critical race theory]], and [[performance studies]] highlights the intersection of race, gender, sexuality and embodiment in constructing subjectivity.

== Biography ==
Born Juana María de la Caridad Rodríguez y Hernández in [[Placetas|Placetas, Cuba]], Rodríguez emigrated to the United States in 1963 with her family.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces''. New York: NYU Press, 2003, p. 126.
&lt;/ref&gt; She has two siblings: and her sister [[Dinorah de Jesús Rodriguez|Dinorah de Jesús Rodríguez]],an experimental filmmaker and visual artist who works between Havana and Miami, and her brother René. Rodríguez identifies as queer and bisexual, and has published work about what she terms "bisexual erasure."&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, Juana María. "Queer Politics, Bisexual Erasure: Sexuality at the Nexus of Race, Gender, and Statistics." ''Lambda Nordica'' 1-2 (2016): 169–182. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education and career ===
Describing herself as an "accidental academic" in reference to her working class upbringing, Rodríguez attended [[City College of San Francisco]] before graduating with a Bachelor's degree from [[San Francisco State University]] in Liberal Studies. Her graduate degrees include a Masters in English and Comparative Literature from [[Columbia University]], and a Ph.D. in Ethnic Studies from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] where she studied with [[Norma Alarcón]], [[Judith Butler]], VèVè A. Clark, and [[Gerald Vizenor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crg.berkeley.edu/content/faculty-profile-associate-professor-juana-mar%C3%AD-rodr%C3%ADguez-gender-womens-studies|title=FACULTY SPOTLIGHT: Associate Professor Juana María Rodríguez, Gender &amp; Women's Studies|last=CRG Editor|first=|date=Fall 2009|website=Faultlines|publisher=Center for Race and Gender|access-date=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before joining the faculty at Berkeley, Rodríguez was an Assistant Professor of English at [[Bryn Mawr College]], and an Associate Professor of Women and Gender Studies at the [[University of California, Davis]] where she served as Director of the Cultural Studies Graduate Group.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://heymiyuki.wordpress.com/2015/11/30/beyond-the-ivory-tower-interviews-with-academics-1-with-juana-maria-rodriguez/|title=Beyond the Ivory Tower: Interviews with Academics #1 with Juana María Rodríguez|last=Baker|first=Miyuki|date=November 30, 2015|website=|publisher=Word Press|access-date=December 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Berkeley, she is affiliated with the Center for Race and Gender, the Center for New Media, the Center for the Study of Sexual Culture and the [[Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society|Haas Institute for a Fair and Equitable Society]], where she was a founding member of the LGBTQ Citizen Cluster.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2014, she was appointed to the [[University of California]] President's Advisory Committee on LGBT Students, Staff, and Faculty Member by [[Janet Napolitano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/lgbt-advisory-group-advances-recommendations-make-campuses-more-inclusive|title=LGBT advisory group advances recommendations to make campuses more inclusive|last=|first=|date=September 29, 2014|website=University of California|publisher=|access-date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic contributions ==
The author of two books, ''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces'' ([[New York University Press|NYU Press]], 2003) and ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' (NYU 2014), Rodríguez has also published essays in ''[[GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies|GLQ: a Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies]]; Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory; [[Radical History Review]]; PMLA; [[MELUS]]; Profession'' and others''.'' Rodríguez's work is considered part of queer of color critique, an intervention into [[queer theory]] that argues that sexuality can not be understood or analyzed outside of the ways it is mutually constituted by race and other dimensions of difference.

=== ''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces'' ===
Rodríguez's first book, ''Queer Latinidad: Identity Practices, Discursive Spaces'' ([[New York University Press|NYU Press]], 2003) introduced the idea of queer ''[[latinidad]]'' as a way to disarticulate the ways that history, geography, colonialism, ethnicity, nationality, language, religion, legal status, immigration status, class, color, and the politics of location exist to complicate facile notions of Latino identity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In that book, Rodríguez identifies three case studies that involve different understandings of ethnic and sexual identity: activism through the queer Latino/a HIV prevention agency [[Proyecto ContraSIDA por Vida]]; law through the [[Asylum in the United States|asylum]] case of Marcelo Tenorio, a gay Brazilian who was granted political asylum in the United States based on sexual persecution; and cyberspace by examining the internet chatrooms of the [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]] (Internet Relay Chat) an early form of digital connectivity.

==== Queering Spanish language ====
In her chapter on the IRC, "'Welcome to the Global Stage': Confessions of a Latina Cyber-Slut" in ''Queer Latinidad'', Rodríguez documents the use of the "@" or arroba in words like Latin@, amig@s, or nostr@s seen in the Spanish language digital spaces she studied, as a "creative linguistic intervention in the highly gendered structure of Spanish." She writes, "Unlike the slash in words such as Latinos/as or amigas/os, which maintains a gender binary while attempting to be inclusive, the @ or "at sign," literally marks where an individual is at in terms of gender."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She has also discussed the use of the "x" in terms such as Latinx and other approaches to the ungendering or queering of Spanish, although she also argues that gender can also be a site of pleasure and affirmation.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Sarah Hayley, and Oscar NÑ. "Latinx: The Ungendering of the Spanish Language." ''Latino USA''. N.p., 29 Jan. 2016. Web. 8 Dec. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' ===
Rodriguez's second book ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' (NYU Press 2014) looks at queer kinship practices, [[sodomy law]]s in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Latin dance]] styles, [[Television advertisement|commercials]], [[pornography]], [[burlesque]], [[San Francisco Pride|queer pride]] marches, alongside sexual practices such as [[BDSM]], [[polyamory]], daddy-play, and [[Butch and femme|butch-femme]] role playing to examine the relationship between sexual politics and sexual practices. In the book and elsewhere, she highlights how the [[Respectability politics|politics of respectability]] that surround sexuality inhibit the potential for more radical interventions into public policy and law around sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Sara. "Faculty Profile: Juana María Rodríguez on Sexuality in Public Discourse | Haas Institute." ''Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society''. N.p., 21 Mar. 2016. Web. 8 Dec. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the book, she uses the idea of [[gesture]] to emphasize non-verbal ways of communicating gendered and ethnic identity, and as a metaphor to think about activist practices that are partial, in-process and incomplete. The book features queer performance artist [[Xandra Ibarra]], and explores the taboo subject of racialized sexual violence.

==== Sexual practices ====
Rodríguez's work is often specifically praised for the ways in which it deals explicitly with queer sexual practices and forms of gender expression such as butch and femme.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dorrance, Jess. "Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings." ''Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory'' 0.0 (2016): 1–3. ''Taylor and Francis+NEJM''. Web. 5 Nov. 2016.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dominguez, Pier 2016"&gt;Dominguez, Pier. "The Potentiality of the Latina Femme Gesture." ''GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies'' 22.1 (2016): 143–145. ''glq.dukejournals.org''. Web. 10 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Tim. "No Sex Please, We're American." ''American Literary History'' (2015): ajv030. ''alh.oxfordjournals.org''. Web. 17 June 2015.
&lt;/ref&gt; She frequently uses her own sexual experiences, or what she terms "sexual archives" to illuminate her ideas on racialized abjection, feminine subjection, sexual vulnerability, and femme identity. In her writing, she often references the sensory, particularly touch, as a way to articulate an embodied sexual practice and a writing practice rooted in sociality.&lt;ref name="Dominguez, Pier 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Dahl, Ulrika. "The Latina Femme Promise of Vulnerability and Access." ''Lambda Nordica'' 1-2 (2016): 191–196.

&lt;/ref&gt; In reviews of her work, reviewers frequently remark on her lyrical use of language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dominguez, Pier 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Other accomplishments ==

=== Awards ===
In 2015, her book, ''Sexual Futures, Queer Gestures, and Other Latina Longings'' won the Alan Bray Memorial Book Prize, by the GL/Q Caucus of the [[Modern Language Association]] and was a [[27th Lambda Literary Awards|Lambda Literary Foundation Finalist for LGBT Studies]].

At the University of California, Berkeley, she has won the Social Science Division, Distinguished Teaching Award and the Graduate Assembly's Faculty Mentor Award.

=== Professional affiliations ===
A member of the [[American Studies Association]], the [[Modern Language Association]], and the [[National Women's Studies Association]], she was chair of the [[Modern Language Association]]'s Committee on the Status of Literatures of People of Color in the United States and edited a collection of essays entitled the "Affirmative Activism Project"&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, Juana María. "The Affirmative Activism Project." ''Profession'' (2007): 156–167. 
&lt;/ref&gt; on diversity in higher education. She was also elected to the National Council of the [[American Studies Association]] for a three-year term in 2013.

'''Marin Petrov Goleminov''' ({{lang-bg|Марин Петров Големинов}}; 28 September 1908 – 19 February 2000) was a [[Bulgaria]]n [[composer]], [[violin]]ist, [[Conducting|conductor]] and [[pedagogue]].

==Life and career==
Goleminov was born in [[Kyustendil]]; the son of an attorney, he studied law before switching to music. Having studied music at [[Sofia]], [[Paris]] and [[Munich]], in 1943 he was appointed to the faculty of the [[National Academy of Music (Bulgaria)|Bulgarian State Academy of Music]] in Sofia to teach orchestration, conducting and composition. From 1954 to 1956 he served as Rector of the [[Sofia National Opera|Sofia Opera]], and as Director of the same organization from 1965 to 1967. In 1976 he was presented with the [[Gottfried von Herder Award]] of the Vienna University, and in 1989 was made an Academician of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]]. He died in [[Espinho, Portugal|Espinho]], [[Portugal]].

Goleminov's compositions draw heavily on the traditional rhythms and melodic patterns of [[Bulgarian folk music]], while also exploring more modernist classical trends. His son [[Michail Goleminov|Michail]] is also a composer.

==Honours==
[[Goleminov Point]] in [[Antarctica]] is named after Marin Goleminov.

'''Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɑː|k|ˈ|t|iː|n|,_|b|ɑː|x|-}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bakhtin "Bakhtin"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ru|Михаи́л Миха́йлович Бахти́н}}, {{IPA-ru|mʲɪxɐˈil mʲɪˈxajləvʲɪtɕ bɐxˈtʲin|pron}}; {{OldStyleDate|16 November|1895|4 November}} – 7 March&lt;ref&gt;Gary Saul Morson and Caryl Emerson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=BViC_wkbd4oC&amp;dq= ''Mikhail Bakhtin: Creation of a Prosaics''], Stanford University Press, 1990, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; 1975) was a [[Russian people|Russian]] [[philosopher]], [[literary critic]], [[semiotician]]&lt;ref&gt;Maranhão 1990, p.197&lt;/ref&gt; and scholar who worked on [[literary theory]], ethics, and the [[philosophy of language]]. His writings, on a variety of subjects, inspired scholars working in a number of different traditions ([[Marxism]], [[semiotics]], [[structuralism]], religious criticism) and in disciplines as diverse as literary criticism, history, philosophy, sociology, anthropology and psychology. Although Bakhtin was active in the debates on aesthetics and literature that took place in the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1920s, his distinctive position did not become well known until he was rediscovered by Russian scholars in the 1960s.

== Early life ==
{{Semiotics}}
Bakhtin was born in [[Oryol]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], to an old family of the nobility. His father was the manager of a bank and worked in several cities. For this reason Bakhtin spent his early childhood years in Oryol, in [[Vilnius]], and then in [[Odessa]], where in 1913 he joined the historical and philological faculty at the local university (the [[Odessa University]]). Katerina Clark and Michael Holquist write: "Odessa..., like Vilnius, was an appropriate setting for a chapter in the life of a man who was to become the philosopher of [[heteroglossia]] and [[Carnivalesque|carnival]]. The same sense of fun and irreverence that gave birth to [[Isaak Babel|Babel]]'s Rabelaisian gangster or to the tricks and deceptions of [[Ostap Bender]], the [[picaro]] created by [[Ilf and Petrov]], left its mark on Bakhtin."&lt;ref&gt;Katerina Clark and Michael Holquist, ''Mikhail Bakhtin'' (Harvard University Press, 1984: {{ISBN|0-674-57417-6}}), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He later transferred to [[Petrograd Imperial University]] to join his brother Nikolai. It is here that Bakhtin was greatly influenced by the classicist [[Tadeusz Stefan Zieliński|F. F. Zelinsky]], whose works contain the beginnings of concepts elaborated by Bakhtin.

== Career ==
Bakhtin completed his studies in 1918. He then moved to a small city in western Russia, [[Nevel (town)|Nevel]] ([[Pskov Oblast]]), where he worked as a schoolteacher for two years. It was at that time that the first "[[Bakhtin Circle]]" formed. The group consisted of intellectuals with varying interests, but all shared a love for the discussion of literary, religious, and political topics. Included in this group were [[Valentin Voloshinov]] and, eventually, [[P. N. Medvedev]], who joined the group later in [[Vitebsk]]. Vitebsk was “a cultural centre of the region” the perfect place for Bakhtin “and other intellectuals [to organize] lectures, debates and concerts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/49580/Mikhail-Bakhtin |title=Mikhail Bakhtin (Russian philosopher and literary critic) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date=1975-03-07 |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; German philosophy was the topic talked about most frequently and, from this point forward, Bakhtin considered himself more a philosopher than a literary scholar. It was in Nevel, also, that Bakhtin worked tirelessly on a large work concerning moral philosophy that was never published in its entirety. However, in 1919, a short section of this work was published and given the title "Art and Responsibility". This piece constitutes Bakhtin's first published work. Bakhtin relocated to Vitebsk in 1920. It was here, in 1921, that Bakhtin married Elena Aleksandrovna Okolovich. Later, in 1923, Bakhtin was diagnosed with [[osteomyelitis]], a bone disease that ultimately led to the amputation of his leg in 1938. This illness hampered his productivity and rendered him an invalid.&lt;ref name="politru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polit.ru/news/2014/11/17/bakhtin/|title=Мемория. Михаил Бахтин|publisher=polit.ru|language=Russian|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Circulo_de_bajtin_1924.JPG|thumb|left|Bakhtin Circle, Leningrad, 1924-26.]]
In 1924, Bakhtin moved to [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], where he assumed a position at the Historical Institute and provided consulting services for the State Publishing House. It is at this time that Bakhtin decided to share his work with the public, but just before "On the Question of the Methodology of Aesthetics in Written Works" was to be published, the journal in which it was to appear stopped publication. This work was eventually published 51 years later. The repression and misplacement of his manuscripts was something that would plague Bakhtin throughout his career. In 1929, "Problems of Dostoevsky’s Art", Bakhtin's first major work, was published. It is here that Bakhtin introduces the concept of [[dialogism]]. However, just as this book was introduced, on 8 December 1928, right before Voskresenie's 10th anniversary, Meyer, Bakhtin and a number of others associated with Voskresenie were apprehended by the Soviet secret police, the [[Joint State Political Directorate|OGPU]] (Hirschkop 1999: p.&amp;nbsp;168), the leaders being sentenced up to ten years in labor camps of [[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]], though after an appeal to consider the state of his health his sentence was commuted to exile to [[Kazakhstan]], where he and his wife spent six years in [[Kostanay|Kustanai]] (now Kostanay), after which in 1936 they moved to [[Saransk]] (then in [[Mordovian ASSR]], now the Republic of [[Mordovia]]) where he taught at the [[Mordovian State University|Mordovian Pedagogical Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, D. J. (2013). Bakhtin reframed. London: I.B. Tauris.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encspb.ru/object/2804015084?lc=en&lt;/ref&gt;

During the six years he spent working as a book-keeper in the town of [[Kustanai]] he wrote several important essays, including "Discourse in the Novel". In 1936, living in [[Saransk]], he became an obscure figure in a provincial college, dropping out of view and teaching only occasionally. In 1937, Bakhtin moved to [[Kimry]], a town located one hundred kilometers from Moscow. Here, Bakhtin completed work on a book concerning the 18th-century German novel which was subsequently accepted by the Sovetskii Pisatel' Publishing House. However, the only copy of the manuscript disappeared during the upheaval caused by the German invasion.

After the amputation of his leg in 1938, Bakhtin's health improved and he became more prolific. In 1940, and until the end of [[World War II]], Bakhtin lived in Moscow, where he submitted a dissertation on [[François Rabelais]] to the [[Gorky Institute of World Literature]] to obtain a postgraduate title,&lt;ref&gt;Holquist ''Dialogism: Bakhtin and His World'' p.10&lt;/ref&gt; a dissertation that could not be defended until the war ended. In 1946 and 1949, the defense of this dissertation divided the scholars of Moscow into two groups: those official opponents guiding the defense, who accepted the original and unorthodox manuscript, and those other professors who were against the manuscript's acceptance. The book's earthy, anarchic topic was the cause of many arguments that ceased only when the government intervened. Ultimately, Bakhtin was denied a [[Higher doctorate|higher doctoral degree]] ([[Doctor of Sciences]]) and granted a lesser degree ([[Candidate of Sciences]], a [[research doctorate]]) by the State Accrediting Bureau. Later, Bakhtin was invited back to Saransk, where he took on the position of chair of the General Literature Department at the Mordovian Pedagogical Institute. When, in 1957, the Institute changed from a teachers' college to a university, Bakhtin became head of the Department of Russian and World Literature. In 1961, Bakhtin's deteriorating health forced him to retire, and in 1969, in search of medical attention, Bakhtin moved back to Moscow, where he lived until his death in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xxi-xxvi&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakhtin's works and ideas gained popularity after his death, and he endured difficult conditions for much of his professional life, a time in which information was often seen as dangerous and therefore often hidden. As a result, the details provided now are often of uncertain accuracy. Also contributing to the imprecision of these details is the limited access to Russian archival information during Bakhtin's life. It is only after the archives became public that scholars realized that much of what they thought they knew about the details of Bakhtin's life was false or skewed largely by Bakhtin himself.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschkop 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works and ideas ==

=== ''Toward a Philosophy of the Act'' ===
''Toward a Philosophy of the Act'' was first published in the USSR in 1986 with the title ''K filosofii postupka''. The manuscript, written between 1919–1921, was found in bad condition with pages missing and sections of text that were illegible. Consequently, this philosophical essay appears today as a fragment of an unfinished work. ''Toward a Philosophy of the Act'' comprises only an introduction, of which the first few pages are missing, and part one of the full text. However, Bakhtin's intentions for the work were not altogether lost, for he provided an outline in the introduction in which he stated that the essay was to contain four parts.&lt;ref&gt;Liapunov xvii&lt;/ref&gt; The first part of the essay deals with the analysis of the performed acts or deeds that comprise the actual world; "the world actually experienced, and not the merely thinkable world." For the three subsequent and unfinished parts of ''Toward a Philosophy of the Act'' Bakhtin states the topics he intends to discuss. He outlines that the second part will deal with aesthetic activity and the ethics of artistic creation; the third with the ethics of politics; and the fourth with religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 54&lt;/ref&gt;

''Toward a Philosophy of the Act'' reveals a young Bakhtin who is in the process of developing his moral philosophy by decentralizing the work of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. This text is one of Bakhtin's early works concerning [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]] and it is here that Bakhtin lays out three claims regarding the acknowledgment of the uniqueness of one's participation in Being:
# I both actively and passively participate in Being.
# My uniqueness is given but it simultaneously exists only to the degree to which I actualize this uniqueness (in other words, it is in the performed act and deed that has yet to be achieved).
# Because I am actual and irreplaceable I must actualize my uniqueness.

Bakhtin further states: "It is in relation to the whole actual unity that my unique thought arises from my unique place in Being."&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 41&lt;/ref&gt; Bakhtin deals with the concept of morality whereby he attributes the predominating legalistic notion of morality to human moral action. According to Bakhtin, the I cannot maintain neutrality toward moral and ethical demands which manifest themselves as one's voice of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Hirschkop 12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

It is here also that Bakhtin introduces an "architectonic" or [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]tic model of the human psyche which consists of three components: "I-for-myself", "I-for-the-other", and "other-for-me". The I-for-myself is an unreliable source of identity, and Bakhtin argues that it is the I-for-the-other through which human beings develop a sense of identity because it serves as an amalgamation of the way in which others view me. Conversely, other-for-me describes the way in which others incorporate my perceptions of them into their own identities. Identity, as Bakhtin describes it here, does not belong merely to the individual, rather it is shared by all.&lt;ref&gt;Emerson and Morson 184-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics'': polyphony and unfinalizability &lt;!--linked from 'Fabula and syuzhet'--&gt; ===
During his time in Leningrad, Bakhtin shifted his view away from the philosophy characteristic of his early works and towards the notion of dialogue. It is at this time that he began his engagement with the work of [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]. ''Problems of Dostoevsky’s Art'' is considered to be Bakhtin's seminal work, a work in which Bakhtin introduces three important concepts.

The first concept is the unfinalizable self: individual people cannot be finalized, completely understood, known, or labeled. Though it is possible to understand people and to treat them as if they are completely known, Bakhtin's conception of '''unfinalizability''' considers the possibility that a person can change, and that a person is never fully revealed or fully known in the world. Readers may find that this conception reflects the idea of the "soul"; Bakhtin had strong roots in [[Christianity]] and in the [[Neo-Kantian]] school led by [[Hermann Cohen]], both of which emphasized the importance of an individual's potentially infinite capability, worth, and the hidden soul.

Second is the idea of the relationship between the self and others, or other groups. According to Bakhtin, every person is influenced by others in an inescapably intertwined way, and consequently no voice can be said to be isolated. In an interview with the [[Novy Mir]] Editorial Staff ('Response to a Question from Novy Mir Editorial Staff'), Bakhtin once explained that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In order to understand, it is immensely important for the person who understands to be located outside the object of his or her creative understanding—in time, in space, in culture. For one cannot even really see one's own exterior and comprehend it as a whole, and no mirrors or photographs can help; our real exterior can be seen and understood only by other people, because they are located outside us in space, and because they are others.
~''New York Review of Books'', June 10, 1993.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, Bakhtin's philosophy greatly respected the influences of others on the self, not merely in terms of how a person comes to be, but also in how a person thinks and how a person sees him- or herself truthfully.

Third, Bakhtin found a true representation of "[[polyphony (literature)|polyphony]]" (i.e. many voices) in Dostoevsky's work. According to Dostoevsky, each character represents a voice that speaks for an individual self, distinct from others. This idea of polyphony is related to the concepts of unfinalizability and self-and-others, since it is the unfinalizability of individuals that creates true polyphony.

Bakhtin briefly outlined the polyphonic concept of truth. He criticized the assumption that, if two people disagree, at least one of them must be in error. He challenged philosophers for whom plurality of minds is accidental and superfluous. For Bakhtin, truth is not a statement, a sentence or a phrase. Instead, understanding is a number of mutually addressed, albeit contradictory and logically inconsistent, statements. Understanding needs a multitude of carrying voices. It cannot be held within a single mind, or be expressed by "a single mouth". The polyphonic truth requires many simultaneous voices. Bakhtin does not mean to say that many voices carry partial truths that complement each other. A number of different voices do not make the truth if simply "averaged" or "synthesized". Rather, it is the fact of mutual addressivity, of engagement, and of commitment to the context of a real-life event, that distinguishes understanding from misunderstanding.

After Bakhtin's ''Problems of Dostoevsky’s Art (1929)'' was translated into English and published in the West, a chapter on the concept of "carnival" was added to the book which was published with the slightly different title, ''Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics (1984)''. According to Bakhtin, ''carnival'' is the context in which distinct individual voices are heard, flourish and interact together. The carnival creates the "threshold" situations where regular conventions are broken or reversed and genuine dialogue becomes possible. The notion of a carnival was Bakhtin's way of describing Dostoevsky's polyphonic style: each individual character is strongly defined, and at the same time the reader witnesses the critical influence of each character upon the other. That is to say, the voices of others are heard by each individual, and each inescapably shapes the character of the other.

=== ''Rabelais and His World'': carnival and grotesque ===
{{Main article|Rabelais and His World}}
During World War II Bakhtin submitted a dissertation on the French Renaissance writer [[François Rabelais]] which was not defended until some years later. The controversial ideas discussed within the work caused much disagreement, and it was consequently decided that Bakhtin be denied his [[higher doctorate]]. Thus, due to its content, ''Rabelais and Folk Culture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance'' was not published until 1965, at which time it was given the title ''[[Rabelais and His World]]''&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xxv&lt;/ref&gt; (Russian: Творчество Франсуа Рабле и народная культура средневековья и Ренессанса, ''Tvorčestvo Fransua Rable i narodnaja kul'tura srednevekov'ja i Renessansa'').
	
In ''Rabelais and His World'', a classic of Renaissance studies, Bakhtin concerns himself with the openness of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel''; however, the book itself also serves as an example of such openness. Throughout the text, Bakhtin attempts two things: he seeks to recover sections of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'' that, in the past, were either ignored or suppressed, and conducts an analysis of the [[Renaissance]] social system in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language that was not. It is by means of this analysis that Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts: the first is ''carnival'' ([[carnivalesque]]) which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and the second is ''[[grotesque body|grotesque realism]]'' which is defined as a literary mode. Thus, in ''Rabelais and His World'' Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body and the material bodily lower stratum.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 297-299&lt;/ref&gt;

In his chapter on the history of laughter, Bakhtin advances the notion of its therapeutic and liberating force, arguing that "laughing truth ... degraded power".&lt;ref&gt;Iswolsky 1965, p. 92f.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Dialogic Imagination'': chronotope and heteroglossia &lt;!--linked from 'Fabula and syuzhet'--&gt; ===
''The Dialogic Imagination'' (first published as a whole in 1975) is a compilation of four essays concerning language and the essay: "[[Epic and Novel]]" (1941), "From the Prehistory of Novelistic Discourse" (1940), "Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel" (1937–1938), and "Discourse in the Novel" (1934–1935). It is through the essays contained within ''The Dialogic Imagination'' that Bakhtin introduces the concepts of ''[[heteroglossia]]'', ''[[dialogism]]'' and ''[[chronotope]]'', making a significant contribution to the realm of literary scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xxvi&lt;/ref&gt; Bakhtin explains the generation of meaning through the "primacy of context over text" (heteroglossia), the hybrid nature of language ([[polyglossia]]) and the relation between [[utterance]]s ([[intertextuality]]).&lt;ref&gt;Maranhão 1990, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wertsch98"&gt;[[James V. Wertsch]] (1998) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=73Vv7Y3vf14C Mind As Action]''&lt;/ref&gt; Heteroglossia is "the base condition governing the operation of meaning in any [[utterance]]."&lt;ref name="Wertsch98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holquist and Emerson 1981, p. 428&lt;/ref&gt; To make an utterance means to "appropriate the words of others and populate them with one's own intention."&lt;ref name="Wertsch98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin&lt;/ref&gt; Bakhtin's deep insights on dialogicality represent a substantive shift from views on the nature of language and knowledge by major thinkers such as [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;Holquist, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bakcult8"&gt;{{citation|last1=Hirschkop|first1=Ken|last2=Shepherd|first2=David G|title=Bakhtin and cultural theory|page=8|isbn=978-0-7190-2615-7|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|year=1989|accessdate=2011-04-26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCO8AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=Bakhtin%20Saussure%20Kant&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}} Unlike Kant, Bakhtin positions aesthetic activity and experience over abstraction. Bakhtin also clashes with Saussure's view of "langue is a 'social fact'", since Bakhtin views Saussure's society as a "disturbing homogenous collective"&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Epic and Novel", Bakhtin demonstrates the novel's distinct nature by contrasting it with the [[Epic poetry|epic]]. By doing so, Bakhtin shows that the novel is well-suited to the post-industrial civilization in which we live because it flourishes on diversity. It is this same diversity that the epic attempts to eliminate from the world. According to Bakhtin, the novel as a genre is unique in that it is able to embrace, ingest, and devour other genres while still maintaining its status as a novel. Other genres, however, cannot emulate the novel without damaging their own distinct identity.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xxxii&lt;/ref&gt;

"From the Prehistory of Novelistic Discourse" is a less traditional essay in which Bakhtin reveals how various different texts from the past have ultimately come together to form the modern novel.&lt;ref name="Holquist81xxxiii"&gt;Holquist 1981, p. xxxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

"Forms of Time and of the Chronotope in the Novel" introduces Bakhtin's concept of [[chronotope]]. This essay applies the concept in order to further demonstrate the distinctive quality of the novel.&lt;ref name="Holquist81xxxiii" /&gt; The word ''chronotope'' literally means "time space" (a concept he refers to that of Einstein) and is defined by Bakhtin as "the intrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships that are artistically expressed in literature."&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 84&lt;/ref&gt; For the purpose of his writing, an author must create entire worlds and, in doing so, is forced to make use of the organizing categories of the real world in which he lives. For this reason ''chronotope'' is a concept that engages reality.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 278&lt;/ref&gt;

The final essay, "Discourse in the Novel", is one of Bakhtin's most complete statements concerning his philosophy of language. It is here that Bakhtin provides a model for a history of discourse and introduces the concept of heteroglossia.&lt;ref name="Holquist81xxxiii" /&gt; The term ''heteroglossia'' refers to the qualities of a language that are extralinguistic, but common to all languages. These include qualities such as perspective, evaluation, and ideological positioning. In this way most languages are incapable of neutrality, for every word is inextricably bound to the context in which it exists.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Speech Genres and Other Late Essays'' ===
In ''Speech Genres and Other Late Essays'' Bakhtin moves away from the novel and concerns himself with the problems of method and the nature of culture. There are six essays that comprise this compilation: "Response to a Question from the ''Novy Mir'' Editorial Staff", "The ''Bildungsroman'' and Its Significance in the History of Realism", "The Problem of Speech Genres", "The Problem of the Text in Linguistics, Philology, and the Human Sciences: An Experiment in Philosophical Analysis", "From Notes Made in 1970-71," and "Toward a Methodology for the Human Sciences."

"Response to a Question from the ''Novy Mir'' Editorial Staff" is a transcript of comments made by Bakhtin to a reporter from a monthly journal called ''[[Novy Mir]]'' that was widely read by Soviet intellectuals. The transcript expresses Bakhtin's opinion of literary scholarship whereby he highlights some of its shortcomings and makes suggestions for improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' and Its Significance in the History of [[Literary realism|Realism]]" is a fragment from one of Bakhtin's lost books. The publishing house to which Bakhtin had submitted the full manuscript was blown up during the German invasion and Bakhtin was in possession of only the prospectus. However, due to a shortage of paper, Bakhtin began using this remaining section to roll cigarettes. So only a portion of the opening section remains. This remaining section deals primarily with [[Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Problem of Speech [[Genre]]s" deals with the difference between Saussurean [[linguistics]] and language as a living dialogue (translinguistics). In a relatively short space, this essay takes up a topic about which Bakhtin had planned to write a book, making the essay a rather dense and complex read. It is here that Bakhtin distinguishes between literary and everyday language. According to Bakhtin, genres exist not merely in language, but rather in communication. In dealing with genres, Bakhtin indicates that they have been studied only within the realm of [[rhetoric]] and [[literature]], but each discipline draws largely on genres that exist outside both rhetoric and literature. These extraliterary genres have remained largely unexplored. Bakhtin makes the distinction between primary genres and secondary genres, whereby primary genres legislate those words, phrases, and expressions that are acceptable in everyday life, and secondary genres are characterized by various types of text such as legal, scientific, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Problem of the Text in Linguistics, Philology, and the Human Sciences: An Experiment in Philosophical Analysis" is a compilation of the thoughts Bakhtin recorded in his notebooks. These notes focus mostly on the problems of the text, but various other sections of the paper discuss topics he has taken up elsewhere, such as speech genres, the status of the author, and the distinct nature of the human sciences. However, "The Problem of the Text" deals primarily with dialogue and the way in which a text relates to its context. Speakers, Bakhtin claims, shape an utterance according to three variables: the object of discourse, the immediate addressee, and a ''superaddressee''. This is what Bakhtin describes as the tertiary nature of dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xvii-xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;

"From Notes Made in 1970-71" appears also as a collection of fragments extracted from notebooks Bakhtin kept during the years of 1970 and 1971. It is here that Bakhtin discusses interpretation and its endless possibilities. According to Bakhtin, humans have a habit of making narrow interpretations, but such limited interpretations only serve to weaken the richness of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final essay, "Toward a Methodology for the Human Sciences", originates from notes Bakhtin wrote during the mid-seventies and is the last piece of writing Bakhtin produced before he died. In this essay he makes a distinction between dialectic and dialogics and comments on the difference between the text and the aesthetic object. It is here also, that Bakhtin differentiates himself from the [[Formalism (literature)|Formalists]], who, he felt, underestimated the importance of content while oversimplifying change, and the [[Structuralism|Structuralists]], who too rigidly adhered to the concept of "code."&lt;ref&gt;Holquist xx-xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disputed texts ==
Some of the works which bear the names of Bakhtin's close friends [[V. N. Vološinov]] and [[P. N. Medvedev]] have been attributed to Bakhtin – particularly ''Marxism and Philosophy of Language'' and ''The Formal Method in Literary Scholarship''. These claims originated in the early 1970s and received their earliest full articulation in English in Clark and Holquist's 1984 biography of Bakhtin. In the years since then, however, most scholars have come to agree that Vološinov and Medvedev ought to be considered the true authors of these works. Although Bakhtin undoubtedly influenced these scholars and may even have had a hand in composing the works attributed to them, it now seems clear that if it was necessary to attribute authorship of these works to one person, Vološinov and Medvedev respectively should receive credit.&lt;ref&gt;Bota and Bronckart.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bakhtin had a difficult life and career, and few of his works were published in an authoritative form during his lifetime.&lt;ref name="Brandist The Bakhtin Circle, 1-26"&gt;Brandist ''The Bakhtin Circle'', 1-26&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there is substantial disagreement over matters that are normally taken for granted: in which discipline he worked (was he a philosopher or literary critic?), how to periodize his work, and even which texts he wrote (see below). He is known for a series of concepts that have been used and adapted in a number of disciplines: [[dialogic|dialogism]], the [[carnivalesque]], the chronotope, heteroglossia and "outsidedness" (the English translation of a Russian term ''vnenakhodimost,'' sometimes rendered into English—from French rather than from Russian—as "exotopy"). Together these concepts outline a distinctive philosophy of language and culture that has at its center the claims that all discourse is in essence a dialogical exchange and that this endows all language with a particular ethical or ethico-political force.

== Legacy ==

As a literary theorist, Bakhtin is associated with the [[Russian Formalists]], and his work is compared with that of [[Yuri Lotman]]; in 1963 [[Roman Jakobson]] mentioned him as one of the few intelligent critics of Formalism.&lt;ref name="Holquist Dialogism, p.183"&gt;Holquist ''Dialogism'', p.183&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, Bakhtin's work tended to focus on ethics and aesthetics in general. Early pieces such as ''Towards a Philosophy of the Act'' and ''Author and Hero in Aesthetic Activity'' are indebted to the philosophical trends of the time—particularly the Marburg School [[Neo-Kantianism]] of Hermann Cohen, including [[Ernst Cassirer]], [[Max Scheler]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Nicolai Hartmann]]. Bakhtin began to be discovered by scholars in 1963,&lt;ref name="Holquist Dialogism, p.183"/&gt; but it was only after his death in 1975 that authors such as [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Tzvetan Todorov]] brought Bakhtin to the attention of the Francophone world, and from there his popularity in the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other countries continued to grow. In the late 1980s, Bakhtin's work experienced a surge of popularity in the West.

Bakhtin's primary works include ''Toward a Philosophy of the Act,'' an unfinished portion of a philosophical essay; ''Problems of Dostoyevsky’s Art,'' to which Bakhtin later added a chapter on the concept of carnival and published with the title ''Problems of Dostoyevsky’s Poetics''; ''Rabelais and His World,'' which explores the openness of the Rabelaisian novel; ''The Dialogic Imagination,'' whereby the four essays that comprise the work introduce the concepts of dialogism, heteroglossia, and chronotope; and ''Speech Genres and Other Late Essays,'' a collection of essays in which Bakhtin concerns himself with method and culture.

In the 1920s there was a "Bakhtin school" in Russia, in line with the [[discourse]] analysis of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and [[Roman Jakobson]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Ludwig Berger]] ''Redeeming Laughter: The Comic Dimension of Human Experience'' (1997) p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence ===
He is known today for his interest in a wide variety of subjects, ideas, vocabularies, and periods, as well as his use of authorial disguises, and for his influence (alongside [[György Lukács]]) on the growth of Western scholarship on the novel as a premiere literary genre. As a result of the breadth of topics with which he dealt, Bakhtin has influenced such Western schools of theory as [[Neo-Marxism]], [[Structuralism]], [[Social constructionism]], and [[Semiotics]]. Bakhtin's works have also been useful in anthropology, especially theories of ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, David  and Eric K. Silverman (2005) "Dialogics of the Body: The Moral and the Grotesque in Two Sepik River Societies." ''Journal of Ritual Studies'' 19 (2) 17-52.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, his influence on such groups has, somewhat paradoxically, resulted in narrowing the scope of Bakhtin's work. According to Clark and Holquist, rarely do those who incorporate Bakhtin's ideas into theories of their own appreciate his work in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Bakhtin is traditionally seen as a literary critic, there can be no denying his impact on the realm of [[Rhetorical|rhetorical theory]]. Among his many theories and ideas Bakhtin indicates that style is a developmental process, occurring both within the user of language and language itself. His work instills in the reader an awareness of tone and expression that arises from the careful formation of verbal phrasing. By means of his writing, Bakhtin has enriched the experience of verbal and written expression which ultimately aids the formal teaching of writing.&lt;ref&gt;Schuster 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Some even suggest that Bakhtin introduces a new meaning to rhetoric because of his tendency to reject the separation of language and ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Klancher 24.&lt;/ref&gt; As Leslie Baxter explains, for Bakhtin, “Because all language use is riddled with multiple voices (to be understood more generally as discourses, ideologies, perspectives, or themes), meaning-making in general can be understood as the interplay of those voices.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Leslie|title=Communication as...: Perspectives on theory|year=2006|publisher=SAGE|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bakhtin and communication studies ===
Bakhtin's communication legacy reaches beyond rhetoric, social constructionism and semiotics as he has been called "the philosopher of human communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Danow|first=David|title=The Thought of Mikhail Bakhtin: From Word to Culture.|year=1991|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bakhtin “concentrates heavily on language and its general use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gary|first=Kim|title=Mikhail Bakhtin: The philosopher of human communication|journal=The University of Western Ontario Journal of Anthropology|year=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=53–62 [54]|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=totem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie Baxter observes: “Communication scholars have much to gain from conversing with Bakhtin’s dialogism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Leslie|title=Voicing relationships: A dialogic perspective|year=2011|publisher=SAGE Publishing, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim argues that “theories of human communication through verbal dialogue or literary representations” such as the ones Bakhtin studied “will apply to virtually every academic discipline in the human sciences."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Gary|title=Mikhail Bakhtin: The philosopher of human communication" (54). |journal=The University of Western Ontario Journal of Anthropology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=53–62|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=totem}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bakhtin's theories on dialogism influence interpersonal communication research, and "dialogism represents a methodological turn towards the messy reality of communication, in all its many language forms.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=E.J.|title=Bakhtinian dialogism: A philosophical and methodological route to dialogue and difference?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/E_White/publication/242580201_Bakhtinian_dialogism_A_philosophical_and_methodological_route_to_dialogue_and_difference/links/559a66b808ae99aa62ccb40f/Bakhtinian-dialogism-A-philosophical-and-methodological-route-to-dialogue-and-difference.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to understand Bakhtin as a communication scholar one must take all forms of communication into account. While Bakhtin's works focused primarily on text, interpersonal communication is also key, especially when the two are related in terms of culture. Kim states that “culture as [[Clifford Geertz|Geertz]] and Bakhtin allude to can be generally transmitted through communication or reciprocal interaction such as a dialogue.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Gary|title=Mikhail Bakhtin: The philosopher of human communication.|journal=The University of Western Ontario Journal of Anthropology|year=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=53–62 [54]|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=totem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Interpersonal communication ====
“Any concrete [[utterance]] is a link in the chain of speech communication of a particular sphere. The very boundaries of the utterance are determined by a change of speech subjects. Utterances are not indifferent to one another, and are not self-sufficient; they are aware of and mutually reflect one another... Every utterance must be regarded as primarily a response to preceding utterances of the given sphere (we understand the word ‘response’ here in the broadest sense). Each utterance refutes affirms, supplements, and relies upon the others, presupposes them to be known, and somehow takes them into account... Therefore, each kind of utterance is filled with various kinds of responsive reactions to other utterances of the given sphere of speech communication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakhtin|first=Mikhail|title=Speech genres and other late essays|year=1986|publisher=University of Austin|location=Texas|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is reminiscent of the inter-personal theory of communication [[turn-taking]]. This means that every utterance is related to another utterance, true to turn-taking in which the conversational norms are followed in order for a conversation to have a cohesive flow in which individuals respond to one another. If, for example, an utterance does not pertain to a previous utterance then a conversation is not occurring. However, the utterance will likely pertain to an utterance that the individual once heard- meaning it is, in fact, interrelated, just not in the context of that particular conversation. As Kim explains, “the entire world can be viewed as [[wikt:polyglossic|polyglossic]] or multi-voiced since every individual possesses their own unique world view which must be taken into consideration through dialogical interaction."&lt;ref name="autogenerated54"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Gary|title=Mikhail Bakhtin: The philosopher of human communication|journal=The University of Western Ontario Journal of Anthropology|year=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=53–62 [54]|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&amp;context=totem}}&lt;/ref&gt; This world view must be considered when a conversation is occurring in order to better understand its cultural and communicative significance.

==== Communication and culture ====
“Bakhtin’s life work can be understood as a critique of the monologization of the human experience that he perceived in the dominant linguistic, literary, philosophical, and political theories of his time."&lt;ref name="baxter102"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=Leslie|title=Communication as...:Perspectives on theory|year=2006|publisher=SAGE Publishing, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  True to his roots of social constructionism and post-modernism Bakhtin “was critical of efforts to reduce the unfinalizable, open, and multivocal process of meaning-making in determinate, closed, totalizing ways."&lt;ref name="baxter102"/&gt; According to Bakhtin, the meaning found in any dialogue is unique to the sender and recipient based upon their personal understanding of the world as influenced by the socio-cultural background. “Bakhtin’s dialogism opens up space for communication scholars to conceive of difference in new ways” meaning they must take the background of a subject into consideration when conducting research into their understanding of any text as “a dialogic perspective argues that difference (of all kinds) is basic to the human experience."&lt;ref name="baxter102"/&gt; Kim argues that “his ideas of art as a vehicle oriented towards interaction with its audience in order to express or communicate any sort of intention is reminiscent of [[Clifford Geertz]]’s theories on culture."&lt;ref name="autogenerated54"/&gt; Culture and communication become inextricably linked to one another as one's understanding, according to Bakhtin, of a given utterance, text, or message, is contingent upon their culture background and experience.

==== Carnivalesque and communication ====
Sheckels contends that "what [... Bakhtin] terms the ‘carnivalesque’ is tied to the body and the public exhibition of its more private functions [...] it served also as a communication event [...] anti-authority communication events [...] can also be deemed ‘carnivalesque’.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheckels|first=T.F.|title=Maryland politics and political communication: 1950-2005|year=2006|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, MD|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Essentially, the act of turning society around through communication, whether it be in the form of text, protest, or otherwise serves as a communicative form of carnival, according to Bakhtin. Steele furthers the idea of carnivalesque in communication as she argues that it is found in corporate communication. Steele states “that ritualized sales meetings, annual employee picnics, retirement roasts and similar corporate events fit the category of carnival.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodman|first=M.B.|title=Corporate communication: Theory and Practice|year=1994|publisher=SUNY|location=Albany|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnival cannot help but be linked to communication and culture as Steele points out that “in addition to qualities of inversion, ambivalence, and excess, carnival’s themes typically include a fascination with the body, particularly its little-glorified or 'lower strata' parts, and dichotomies between ‘high’ or ‘low’.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodman|first=M.B.|title=Corporate communication: Theory and Practice|year=1994|publisher=SUNY|location=Albany|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high and low binary is particularly relevant in communication as certain verbiage is considered high, while slang is considered low. Moreover, much of popular communication including television shows, books, and movies fall into high and low brow categories. This is particularly prevalent in Bakhtin's native Russia, where postmodernist writers such as [[Boris Akunin]] have worked to change low brow communication forms (such as the mystery novel) into higher literary works of art by making constant references to one of Bakhtin's favorite subjects, [[Dostoyevsky]].

[[File:Inuit-Stiefel.jpg|thumb|Sealskin kamik. Left, winter kamik, right, summer kamik. Rachel Uyarasuk, [[Iglulik]], [[Nunavut]], [[Canada]]]]
'''Mukluks''' or '''Kamik''' ([[Inuktitut]]: [[Inuktitut syllabics|ᑲᒥᒃ]] {{IPA-iku|kaˈmik|}}&lt;ref&gt;''kamik'' Inuktitut Living Dictionary. Retrieved September 14, 2012, from [http://www.livingdictionary.com/search/viewResults.jsp?resultsId=1347641572684ri link].&lt;/ref&gt;) (singular: ᑲᒪᒃ ''kamak'', plural: ᑲᒦᑦ ''kamiit'') are a soft [[boot]], traditionally made of [[reindeer]] ([[caribou]]) skin or [[Pinniped|sealskin]], and worn by [[Arctic]] aboriginal people, including the [[Inuit]], [[Iñupiat]], and [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]]. 

Mukluks may be worn over an inner boot liner and under a protective overshoe.&lt;ref name=tyman_winter/&gt;&lt;ref name=first&gt;http://firstpeoplesofcanada.com/fp_groups/fp_inuit5.html&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''mukluk'' is often used for any soft boot designed for cold weather, and modern designs may use both traditional and modern materials. The word "mukluk" is of [[Iñupiat]] and [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]] origin, from ''maklak'', the [[bearded seal]], while "kamik" is an Inuit word. In the Inuipiaq language the "u" makes an "oo" sound, and so the spelling "maklak" is used with the same pronunciation.

[[File:Inuit footwear, Iglulik, 1987 - Bata Shoe Museum - DSC00395.JPG|thumb|Three-layer winter footwear system. Left to right, short overshoe, inner (fur inwards), outer (fur outwards).]]

==Related boots==
Another type of boot, sometimes called an '''Inuit boot''', originating in [[Greenland]] and the eastern part of [[Alaska]], is made by binding it with animal cartilage, and has a centre seam running down to the foot of the boot.

Another type has a soft leather sole, but the upper is knitted out of wool or a wool-rayon blend. Often called "Slipper Socks", these are traditionally worn by the people of the [[Hindu Kush]] Mountains.{{Relevance inline|date=December 2017}}

==Function==
As mukluks are soft-soled, and flex [[Anatomical terms of motion#Hands and feet|with the feet]], they allow hunters to move very quietly. A wearer can run, tip-toe, and even dance in mukluks.

Mukluks weigh little. While, for instance, U.S. Marine extreme-cold-weather boots weigh eight pounds (4kg), soft-soled boots made using modern materials weigh less than a tenth of that.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.taigaworks.ca/cart.php?m=product_detail&amp;p=51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mec&gt;https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5031-589/Expedition-Plus-Bootie&lt;/ref&gt; Because mukluks weigh little, there is no need for heavy lacing; [[friction]] is enough to hold them on the foot. Some mukluks are very lightly laced (through external loops sewn into the seams, so as not to leak). They may be laced over the arch of the foot, or around the top of the boot to stiffen it.&lt;ref&gt;freyahoffmeister.com/expeditions/greenland-national-championships-in-sisimiut-2006/&lt;/ref&gt; Many, however, have no lacing to constrict the [[Circulatory system|circulation]] and make the foot cold. The top of the boot stands up somewhat stiffly, and may be open at the top, which allows moisture to escape.

The design of the mukluk is used for the industrial manufacture of cold-weather boots, especially paired with a rugged contemporary sole. The key component of its success is its ability to breathe, that is, to allow air exchange. This is an advantage in extremely cold conditions where perspiration may become a factor in frostbite on one's feet. The bulkiness paired with their poor performance in slush makes them less ideal for the casual winter wearer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Manufacture==
[[File:Eskimos drilling ivory and making mukluks, Port Clarence, Alaska, ca 1900 (HEGG 337).jpeg|thumb|left|Making mukluks, right (left, drilling ivory), ca. 1900, Port Clarence, Alaska]]
Mukluks are often made with a wrapped sole, so that the seam around the sole is on the top and sides of the boot, not on the bottom edge. This helps avoid wear on the seams and leaks. 

Kamiks made for cold, dry winter weather may have fur low down on the outside, and other features that would be a problem when not on dry, powdery snow. Kamiks for warm, slushy, muddy, or open-ocean conditions are stitched finely from waterproof sealskin (see illustration, top left)&lt;ref name=tyman_summer&gt;http://www.johntyman.com/arctic/inuit202.html&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Blind stitch|Blind-stitching]] (not piercing the full depth of the skin) with sinew, which shrinks when wet, helps keep mukluks watertight.&lt;ref name=tyman_winter/&gt;&lt;ref name=tyman_summer/&gt; Commercial boots of modern materials will often require seam-sealing after purchase if they are to be fully waterproof.

Usually, the uppers of summer kamik are made [[ringed seal]] skin, while the soles are made of [[bearded seal]], which is tougher. The skin requires laborious preparation.&lt;ref name=tyman_summer/&gt; Winter kamik are often made of caribou leg fur; caribou, unlike seals, rely on fur rather than blubber for insulation, so their fur is warmer.&lt;ref name=tyman_winter/&gt;&lt;ref name=tyman_summer/&gt;

The short overshoes may also be made waterproof for wet conditions&lt;ref name=tyman_summer/&gt; or furry and grippy for dry ones.&lt;ref name=first/&gt;&lt;ref name=tyman_winter/&gt;

For insulation, mukluks may be lined with furs such as [[caribou]], [[rabbit]], [[fox]] and [[raccoon]]. Down, polyester, and closed-celled [[EVA foam]] is also used in soft-soled boots.&lt;ref name=mec/&gt; The inner boot is often made with the fur facing inwards.&lt;ref name=tyman_winter/&gt; It may also be made of textile.

Mukluks may be adorned with [[pompon]]s, [[bead]]s, embroidery, and other methods.

After a year's storage, traditional skin kamiks tend to stiffen and need to be worked and stretched to make them pliable again.&lt;ref name=tyman_winter&gt;http://www.johntyman.com/arctic/inuit201.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nazl el-Sourour''''' (also spelled ''Nazl es-Surur'', ''Nazel el-Surour'', etc.; {{lang-ar|نزل السرور}}, literally "Happiness Hotel") is a musical play created by Lebanese playwright and composer [[Ziad Rahbani]].&lt;ref name="PopC"&gt;

==Plot summary==
''Zakaria'' (Ziad) is an unemployed and penniless horse-racing betting addict. He is kicked out from his house by his wife Suraya and forced to choose a poor-man's motel called ''Nazl es-Surur''.

Much to his dismay, the motel is raided by two laid-off factory workers during his first night stay. The insurgents Abbas and Fahed, armed with machine guns and dynamite take the residents hostage. Abbas and Fahed were fired from their work because they were pushing co-workers to go on strike and they chose to take a "revolutionary" approach. Things go downhill from there on.&lt;ref name="PopC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ZRx"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpcyAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%D9%86%D8%B2%D9%84+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B1&amp;dq=%D9%86%D8%B2%D9%84+%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B1&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=o5WUTqOlGePc4QTqifGhCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA | script-title=ar:نزل السرور | publisher=University of Michigan | work=نزل السرور | year=1994 | accessdate=October 11, 2011 | author=Rahbani, Ziad|language=ar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="x"&gt;[http://kassab2.tripod.com/id22.html Nazel el sourour summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''Nazl es-Surur'' was Ziad's second play after ''Sahriyya'' (An evening's celebration - 1973) but unlike the Rahbani movement conforming ''Sahriyya'', ''Nazl es-Surur'' came to stand in contrast to the prevalent folklore orientation and theatricality of the works of his parents; it marked Ziad's ideological and artistic definitive break from the Rahbani school of thought.&lt;ref name= "PopC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bok"&gt;{{cite book | title=Translation, Humour and Literature - Language-based humor and the untranslatable: The case of Ziad Rahbani's theatre | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |author1=Chiaro, Delia |author2=Elzeer, Nada | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-4411-5823-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was considered as an augury to the [[Lebanese Civil War]] which erupted in 1975, but Ziad himself rejected this view, affirming that it was based on a real life incident, the taking of hostages at the Beirut branch of the Bank of America.&lt;ref name= "PopC"/&gt;

Although made in 1974, the play is still popular among Lebanese people and in the Arabic world notably for its songs and script; in fact Ziad had introduced a new kind of language-based humor that was unprecedented in Lebanese theater.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Fragments of dialogue from ''Nazl es-Surur'' and later Ziad plays continue to be used today and have become a part of the Lebanese pop-culture. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}The "Zakaria" character reappears with his wife "Souraya" in the 1978 play ''Bennesbe la bokra shou?'' (What do we need to do tomorrow?).&lt;ref name="Bok"/&gt;

This play was Ziad's first real appearance, which was performed in Cinema Orly theater.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} [[Fairouz]] was impressed by the song "Ba'atelak" (which reminds us of the period of the late Egyptian singer [[Mounira El Mahdeya]]), to the extent that she re-taped that song with her voice after it was sung by a second class singer in the beginning of the seventies.&lt;ref name="x" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bok"/&gt;

The '''Obi-Rakhmat Grotto''' is a [[Middle Paleolithic]] prehistoric site that yielded [[Neanderthal]] fossils. It is a shallow [[karst]] cave near the junction of the Chatkal and [[Pskem River]]s  at the southwestern end of the Talassky Alatau Range in the [[Tien Shan Mountains]], {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]].

== Excavations ==
The Obi-Rakhmat Grotto was discovered in 1962 by a team from the Institute of History and Archaeology of Uzbekistan, headed by A. R. Mukhamedzhanov. Initial excavations were carried out under the supervision of [[M. M. Gerasimov]] and H. K. Nasretdinov and from 1964 to 1965 by R. H. Suleimanov. An international multidisciplinary team resumed excavations in 1998 under the direction of [[Anatoly Derevyanko]], Andrei Krivoshapkin and Patrick Wrinn.&lt;ref name="Andrei I. Krivoshapkin"&gt;Andrei I. Krivoshapkin and P. Jeffrey Brantingham, The Lithic Industry of Obi-Rakhmat Grotto, Uzbekistan {{cite web|url= http://paleo.sscnet.ucla.edu/KrivoshapkingBrantUISPP2004.pdf |title=The Lithic Industry of Obi-Rakhmat Grotto, Uzbekistan }}. In: Actes du XIV Congres UISPP, 2–8 septembre 2001. BAR International 1240: 203-214&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stratigraphy ==

The cave is {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide at the entrance and {{convert|11.8|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} high and sitting at an elevation of {{convert|1250|m|ft|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="Carolina Mallol"&gt;Carolina Mallol, Susan M. Mentzer and Patrick J. Wrinn, A Micromorphological and Mineralogical Study of Site Formation Processes at the Late Pleistocene Site of Obi-Rakhmat, Uzbekistan{{cite web|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224962444_A_Micromorphological_and_Mineralogical_Study_of_Site_Formation_Processes_at_the_Late_Pleistocene_Site_of_Obi-Rakhmat_Uzbekistan |title=ineralogical Study of Site Formation Processes at the Late Pleistocene Site of Obi-Rakhmat }}. Geoarchaeology: An International Journal, Vol. 24, No. 5, 548–575 (2009). Published online in Wiley Interscience (www.interscience.wiley.com). DOI:10.1002/gea.20280&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence of deposits has a depth of about {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} and divides into 22 [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] units, based on texture and archaeological content. The rich [[Assemblage (archaeology)|assemblages]] of [[stone tool|lithic]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] suggest prolonged Neanderthal occupation.
* '''Artefacts''': core-burins on large flakes, unidirectional blade and flake cores, (mostly retouched [[blade]]s and retouched pointed blades, while other common types include [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s, atypical end [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], sidescrapers ([[grattoir de côté]]) and [[Mousterian]] points) and [[Levallois technique|Levallois]] forms. The Levallois forms are concentrated in the basal layers, especially stratum 19. The principal raw material is local [[Petrifaction|petrified]] [[limestone]].

Obi-Rakhmat's tool industry differs in only minor ways from the classic and elongated Levallois points of Kara-Bom. Obi-Rakhmat's finds share features of both the late Middle Paleolithic and the early [[Upper Paleolithic]] artifacts of Southwest Asia and the [[Altai Mountains]]. It appears that the Upper Paleolithic in the Altai emerged from a local Middle Paleolithic culture established in the area around 100,000 to 50,000 years ago. Based on material of the most recent excavations from 2007 to 2009 there is reason to assume that the Obi-Rakhmat lithic artefacts represent a transitional Middle-to-Upper Paleolithic industry.&lt;ref name="Chronology"&gt;Andrei I Krivoshapkin, Yaroslav V Kuzmin, A J Timothy Jull, Chronology of the Obi-Rakhmat Grotto (Uzbekistan): First Results on the Dating and Problems of the Paleolithic Key Site in Central Asia {{cite web|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224962231_Chronology_of_the_Obi-Rakhmat_Grotto_Uzbekistan_First_Results_on_the_Dating_and_Problems_of_the_Paleolithic_Key_Site_in_Central_Asia |title= First Results on the Dating and Problems of the Paleolithic Key Site in Central Asia}}. Proceedings of the 20th International Radiocarbon Conference, edited by A J T Jull. RADIOCARBON, Vol 52, Nr 2–3, 2010, p 549–554&lt;/ref&gt;

Stratum 19 seems to represent a series of exceptionally intensive occupational episodes because of the high density of finds and the presence of charcoal, burnt bones and artefacts.&lt;ref name="Carolina Mallol" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrei I. Krivoshapkin" /&gt;

== Chronology ==
([[Uranium-thorium dating]]s of [[travertine]] sediments range between 70,000–100,000 years [[Before Present|BP]]. These results are less secure due to the high uranium content and the presence of detritus, which contaminates dated sediments. [[electron paramagnetic resonance|ESR]] analysis of tooth enamel for eight [[Bovidae]]  give an age estimation of ca. 57,000 to 73,000 years BP (strata 12–14) and ca. 87,000 years BP (basal stratum 21.1). The preliminary results of [[optically stimulated luminescence|OSL]] dating on sediments from several profile locations gave uniform ages for all cultural successions: stratum 5.1 (56,000 ± 3200 years), stratum 8.1 (60,100 ± 3000 years), and stratum 21.2 (61,400 ± 3600 years):&lt;ref name="Chronology" /&gt;

Parts of the sequence is beyond the limit of sensitivity of the C&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; dating method. However layer 9, dated to 42,100 years BP is well within the limit. Possibly, the age of layer 14.1 (48,800 years BP) may be a minimal estimate, but more study is necessary to precisely determine the age. The true age of layer 14 at Obi-Rakhmat site is still open to discussion.&lt;ref name="Chronology" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrei I Krivoshapkin, Yaroslav V Kuzmin, A J Timothy Jull, Chronology of the Obi-Rakhmat Grotto (Uzbekistan): First Results on the Dating and Problems of the Paleolithic Key Site in Central Asia. Proceedings of the 20th International Radiocarbon Conference, edited by A J T Jull. RADIOCARBON, Vol 52, Nr 2–3, 2010, p 549–554. p 553]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fauna ==
The faunal assemblage is dominated by the [[Capra sibirica|Siberian mountain goat]] (''Capra sibirica'') and [[Cervus elaphus|red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus''), which constitute 90% of the identified fossils. Other faunal remains include sheep (''[[Ovis]]'' sp.), wild boar (''[[Sus scrofa]]''), fox (''[[Vulpes vulpes]]'') and marmot (''[[Marmot]]a sp''.). Carnivore remains are rare.

Evidence of human modification of the bones including cut marks, [[conchoidal fracture|conchoidal impact]], scars and burning, is consistently present. The lithic artefacts and faunal remains recovered at Obi-Rakhmat suggest that the site was repeatedly used by hominins as a short-term hunting and butchery station.&lt;ref name="Carolina Mallol" /&gt;

== Hominin remains ==

=== OR 1 ===
In 2003, hominin remains were recovered from stratum 16. They consist of 6 isolated permanent [[Maxilla|upper]] teeth and 121 cranial fragments from a single juvenile.&lt;ref name="Michelle Glantz"&gt;Michelle Glantz, Bence Viola, Patrick Wrinn, Tatiana Chikisheva, Anatoly Derevianko, Andrei Krivoshapkin, Uktur Islamov, Rustam Suleimanov, Terrence Ritzman, New hominin remains from Uzbekistan {{cite journal|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004724840800050X |title=New hominin remains from Uzbekistan | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2007.12.007 | volume=55 |journal=Journal of Human Evolution |pages=223–237}}.

=== Morphology ===
Six isolated permanent teeth were found. They consisted of an upper lateral incisor, upper third premolar, upper fourth premolar, upper first molar, and an upper second molar, as well as 121 cranial fragments. All of the teeth found had complete crowns with developed roots. The varying size of the roots in each tooth make it difficult to determine if they are damaged, or the length they are because of development. It was determined that all of the pieces belonged to a 9-12-year-old juvenile. The sex of this particular fossil remains unknown. The teeth found have [[Neanderthal]] features, as some of them show [[Taurodontism]], which is primarily found in the Neanderthal morphology. Studies of the pieces of cranium found are more ambiguous and harder to link to Neanderthals. The [[Parietal bone]] has a stronger likeness to anatomically modern humans, while other bones of the skull can be linked to Neanderthal craniums. Most researchers believe that this particular fossil is a Neanderthal because of the analysis of its dentition.

The Obi-Rakhmat fossil expresses a relatively Neanderthal-like dentition coupled with more ambiguous cranial anatomy (e.g., its [[parietal bone|parietal]] size and aspects of the external surface of its [[temporal bone|temporal]]) that does not conform to existing descriptions of sub-adult Neanderthals. It represents an individual of roughly 9 to 12 years of age at death, estimated from the examination of relative root development and degree of dental wear.&lt;ref name="Michelle Glantz" /&gt;

The sub-adult bone yielded non-calibrated  dates ranging from 29,990 ± 500 years BP to 37,800 ± 450 years BP.&lt;ref name="Johannes Krause" /&gt; To date, the best chronological estimate for the hominid remains from Obi-Rakhmat is ca. 60,000 to 90,000 years BP &lt;ref name="Michelle Glantz" /&gt; and 70,000 years BP.&lt;ref&gt;Anne R.

=== DNA analysis ===
The [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) sequences from the Obi-Rakhmat sub-adult ([[#OR 1|OR-1]]) and [[Teshik Tash]] child fall within the European Neanderthal mtDNA variation, showing that both individuals belonged to a population related to European and western Asian Neanderthals. However, the Teshik Tash mtDNA sequence seems to be more closely related to the mtDNA sequence from [[Scladina]] in western Europe than to the sequence from [[Okladnikov Cave]]. The absence of deep mtDNA divergence shows that Central Asian, Caucasian and European Neanderthals were not separated for a long time, supporting the view that Central Asia (most of the Russian plains) was relatively recently colonized by Neanderthals, maybe not before an exceptionally warm episode 125,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Johannes Krause"&gt;Johannes Krause, Ludovic Orlando, David Serre, Bence Viola, Kay Prüfer, Michael P.

'''Paleofeces''' (UK: Palaeofaeces) are ancient [[human feces]], often found as part of [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavations or surveys.  The term [[coprolite]] is often used interchangeably. Intact feces of ancient people may be found in caves in arid climates and in other locations with suitable preservation conditions.  They are studied to determine the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[health]] of the people who produced them through the analysis of seeds, small bones, and parasite eggs found inside. The feces can contain information about the person excreting the material as well as information about  the material itself. They can also be chemically analyzed for more in-depth information on the individual who excreted them, using [[lipid]] analysis and ancient [[DNA]] analysis. The success rate of usable DNA extraction is relatively high in paleofeces, making it more reliable than skeletal DNA retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;A Molecular Analysis of Dietary Diversity for Three Archaic Native Americans. Hendrik N. Poinar et al. PNAS 10 April 2001: 98 (8) 4317-4322. [DOI 10.1073/pnas.061014798]&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The reason this analysis is possible at all is due to the digestive system not being entirely efficient, in the sense that not everything that passes through the digestive system is destroyed. Not all of the surviving material is recognizable, but some of it is. This material is generally the best indicator archaeologists can use to determine ancient diets, as no other part of the archaeological record is as direct an indicator.&lt;ref&gt;Feder, Kenneth L., Linking to the Past: A Brief Introduction to Archaeology. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process that preserves the feces in a way such that they can be analyzed later is called the [[Maillard reaction]]. This reaction creates a casing of sugar that preserves the feces from the elements. To extract and analyze the information contained within, researchers generally have to freeze the feces and grind it up into powder for analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Divining Diet and Disease From DNA. Erik Stokstad. Science 28 July 2000: 289 (5479), 530-531. [DOI:10.1126/science.289.5479.530]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of research==

Analysis of archaeological feces has a relatively short history compared to many other archaeological materials. The founder of the discipline is  Dr. Eric O. Callen, who pioneered the subject in the late 1950s to mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Archaeological coprolite science: The legacy of Eric O. Callen (1912–1970)|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2005.11.032|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018206001027|year=2013|last1=Bryant|first1= V.|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|volume=237|issue=1|pages=51–66}}
&lt;/ref&gt; His early papers used coprolite analysis to investigate early Mexican diets, published in The Prehistory of the Tehuacan Valley: Environment, and Subsistence. Despite his work showing promise, archaeological coprolite studies remained a niche topic, with few other researchers becoming involved. After Callen's sudden death in 1970, his work was continued by [http://anthropology.tamu.edu/html/profile--vaughnbryant.html Vaughn Bryant] at [[Texas A&amp;M University]], Department of Anthropology. Coprolite analysis gradually became a topic of serious study. Today coprolite analysis in archaeology has increased exponentially, and they have provided important evidence concerning the evolution of human health and diet, in the Americas and other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Biomolecular and micromorphological analysis of suspected faecal deposits at Neolithic Çatalhöyük, Turkey|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2011.03.031|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440311001166|year=2011|last1=Shillito|first1= L-M.|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=38|issue=8|pages=1869–1877|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most famous examples is the coprolite from [[Paisley Caves]], Oregon, which has provided some of the earliest evidence for the human occupation of North America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/320/5877/786.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of analysis==

A wide variety of methods can be used to analyse ancient feces, ranging from microscopic to molecular. At a basic level the analysis of size and morphology can provide some information on whether they are likely to be human or from another animal. Analyzed contents can include those visible to the naked eye, such as seeds and other plant remains—to the microscopic, including pollen and phytoliths. Parasites in coprolites can give information on the living conditions and health of ancient populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879981713000405 | doi=10.1016/j.ijpp.2013.04.003 | volume=3 | title=Human intestinal parasites from a latrine in the 12th century Frankish castle of Saranda Kolones in Cyprus | journal=International Journal of Paleopathology | pages=218–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the molecular level, ancient [[DNA]] analysis can be used both to identify the species and to provide dietary information. A method using [[lipid]] analysis can also be used for species identification, based on the range of fecal [[sterols]] and [[bile acids]].&lt;ref&gt;http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/073/Ant0730086.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These molecules vary between species according to gut biochemistry, and so can distinguish between humans and other animals.

An example of researchers using paleofeces for the gathering of information using DNA analysis occurred at Hinds Cave in Texas by Hendrik Poinar and his team. The fecal samples obtained were over 2,000 years old. From the samples, Poinar was able to gather DNA samples using the analysis methods recounted above. From his research Poinar found that the feces belonged to three Native Americans, based on mtDNA similarities to present day Native Americans. Poinar also found DNA evidence of the food they ate. There were samples of buckthorn, acorns, ocotillo, nightshade and wild tobacco. No visible remnants of these plants were visible in the fecal matter. Along with plant material, there were also DNA sequences of animal species such as bighorn sheep and pronghorn antelope, both of which lack any evidence elsewhere in Hinds Cave, indicating that they were killed and consumed elsewhere.

This analysis of the diet was very helpful. Previously it was assumed that this population of Native Americans survived with berries being their main source of nutrients. From the paleofeces, it was determined that these assumptions were incorrect and in the approximately 2 days of food that are represented in a fecal sample, 2-4 animal species and 4-8 plant species were represented. The nutritional diversity of this archaic human population was rather extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;A Molecular Analysis of Dietary Diversity for Three Archaic Native Americans. Hendrik N. Poinar et al. PNAS 10 April 2001: 98 (8) 4317-4322. [DOI 10.1073/pnas.061014798]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the use of lipid analysis for identification of species is at the Neolithic site of [[Catalhoyuk]] in Turkey. Large midden deposits at the site are frequently found to contain fecal material &lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-archaeology.com/features/turkey-neolithic-life-at-catalhoyuk.htm&lt;/ref&gt; either as distinct coprolites or compressed 'cess pit' deposits. This was initially thought to be from dog on the basis of digested bone, however an analysis of the lipid profiles showed that many of the coprolites were actually from humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440311001166 | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2011.03.031 | volume=38 | title=Biomolecular and micromorphological analysis of suspected faecal deposits at Neolithic Çatalhöyük, Turkey | journal=Journal of Archaeological Science | pages=1869–1877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of parasites from fecal material within cesspits has provided evidence for health and migration in past populations. For example, the identification of fish tapeworm eggs in Acre in the Crusader period indicate that this parasite was transported from northern Europe. The parasite was rarely seen in the Levant area during this time but was common in Northern Europe. It is suggested that it was brought to the region by the incoming Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879981711000337 | doi=10.1016/j.ijpp.2011.10.005 | volume=1 | title=Human intestinal parasites in crusader Acre: Evidence for migration with disease in the medieval period | journal=International Journal of Paleopathology | pages=132–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20966">'''Political theology''' investigates the ways in which [[Theology|theological]] concepts or ways of thinking relate to [[politics]], [[society]], and [[economics]]. It has often been affiliated with Christianity, but since the 21st century, it has more recently been discussed with relation to other religions.

== Terminology ==
The term "political theology" is often used to denote religious thought about political principled questions. Scholars such as [[Carl Schmitt]] use it to denote religious concepts that were secularized and thus became key political concepts.{{cn|date=September 2017}} Another term which often occupies similar space in academic discourse is "[[public theology]]". It is said that political theology is directed more towards the government or the state, whereas public theology is more towards [[civil society]].{{sfn|Bell|2015|p=117}}

== Developments ==
The term ''political theology'' has been used in a wide variety of ways by writers exploring different aspects of believers' relationship with politics. It has been used to discuss [[Augustine of Hippo]]'s ''[[The City of God (book)|City of God]]''{{sfnm |1a1=Doody |1a2=Hughes |1a3=Paffenroth |1y=2005 |2a1=Elshtain |2y=2004}} and [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.{{sfn|Bauerschmidt|2004}} It has likewise been used to describe the [[Eastern Orthodox Church | Eastern Orthodox]] view of [[Symphonia (theology) | ''symphonia'']]{{sfn|McGuckin|2008|pp=391–395}} and the works of the [[Protestant Reformers|Protestant reformers]] [[Martin Luther]]{{sfn|Höpfl|1991|pp=xxii–xxiii}} and [[John Calvin]].{{sfn|Höpfl|1991}}{{page number|date=November 2017}} Though the political aspects of [[Christianity and politics|Christianity]], [[Political aspects of Islam|Islam]], [[Confucianism]], and other traditions has been debated for millennia, political theology has been an academic discipline since the 20th century.{{sfn|Bowker|2000}}

The recent use of the term is often associated with the work of [[Carl Schmitt]]. Writing amidst the turbulence of the [[Germany|German]] [[Weimar Republic]], Schmitt argued in his essay ''[[Carl Schmitt#Political Theology|Politische Theologie]]'' (1922){{sfn|Schmitt|2005}} that the main concepts of modern politics were secularized versions of older theological concepts. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] had used the term in his 1871 text "The Political Theology of Mazzini and the International"{{sfn|Marshall|1992|pp=300–301}} to which Schmitt's book was a response.{{sfnm |1a1=Maier |1y=1995 |1pp=75–76 |2a1=Schmitt |2y=2005 |2pp=64–66}} Drawing on [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' he argued that the [[State (polity)|state]] exists to maintain its own integrity in order to ensure [[Social order|order in society]] in times of crisis.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Some{{who?|date=July 2017}} have divided the approach of political theology between a rightist traditional concern with individual "moral reform" (such as Clyde Wilcox's ''God's Warriors'' [1992] and Ted Jelen's ''The Political World of the Clergy'' [1993]) and a leftist focus on collective "social justice" (such as [[Jeffrey K. Hadden]]'s ''The Gathering Storm in the Churches'' [1969] and Harold Quinley's ''The Prophetic Clergy'' [1974]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Williams |first=Rhys H. |author-link=Rhys H. Williams (sociologist) |year=1998 |title=Political Theology on the Right and Left |url=http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=332 |magazine=The Christian Century |volume=115 |issue=21 |location=Chicago |pages=722–724 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608162549/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=332 |archive-date=8 June 2013 |access-date=25 November 2017 |via=Religion Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kwok Pui-lan]] has argued that, while Schmitt may have come up with the term and its modern usage, political theologies were likewise forming along very different trajectories elsewhere around the world, such as in Asia. In China in the 1930s, for instance, the Protestant [[Y. T. Wu|Wu Yaozong]] advocated that a social revolution was necessary to save both China and the world.{{sfn|Kwok|2016}} This would likewise be true of the role of Protestants involved in Korean nationalism in the early twentieth century.{{sfn|Wells|1990}}

Many major non-Christian philosophers have written extensively on the topic of political theology during recent years, such as [[Jürgen Habermas]],{{sfn|Afrasiabi|1998}} [[Giorgio Agamben]], [[Simon Critchley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Critchley |first=Simon |author-link=Simon Critchley |date=1 February 2012 |title=Simon Critchley on 'The Faith of the Faithless: Experiments in Political Theology' |url=http://www.politicaltheology.com/blog/simon-critchley-on-the-faith-of-the-faithless-experiments-in-political-theology/ |website=Political Theology Today |access-date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Slavoj Zizek]].{{sfn|Breger|2001}} Since the early 21st century, there has also been a growing discourse around [[Islam]]ic political theology, especially within Western contexts that were previously dominated by Christianity.{{sfn|Lloyd|2013}}{{sfn|Ghobadzadeh|2018}}

== By region ==
=== China ===
{{Main article|Political theology in China}}
Political theology in China includes responses from Chinese government leaders, scholars, and religious leaders who deal with the relationship between religion and politics. For two millennia, this was organized based on a Confucian understanding of religion and politics, often discussed in terms of Confucian political philosophy.{{sfn|Wong|2011}} At various points throughout its history, Chinese Buddhism presented an alternative to the political import of Confucianism. However, since the mid-twentieth century, [[Communist Party of China|communist]] understandings of religion have dominated the discourse.

For Christianity, this relationship can be seen from the religion's earliest encounters in the country during the imperial period, with the [[Church of the East in China|Church of the East]]'s interaction with the [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]] and [[Jesuit missions to China|Jesuit missionaries]] in the Ming court. But it has developed the most in the 20th and 21st centuries after the establishments of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] and [[People's Republic of China]], especially through the establishment of the [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] and rise of [[House church (China)|house church]]es.

=== Germany ===
The influence of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) is also evident throughout much of German political theology. This is particularly clear in the work of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] theologian [[Johann Baptist Metz]] (born 1928) who explored the concept of political theology throughout his work.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://guweb2.gonzaga.edu/metz/ Johann-Baptist Metz]", ''The Vocabulary of Political Theology'', [[Gonzaga University]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=November 2017}} He argued for the concept of a "suffering God" who shared the pain of his creation, writing, "Yet, faced with conditions in God's creation that cry out to heaven, how can the theology of the creator God avoid the suspicion of apathy unless it takes up the language of a suffering God?" This leads Metz to develop a theology that is related to [[Marxism]]. He criticizes what he terms bourgeois Christianity and believes that the Christian Gospel has become less credible because it has become entangled with bourgeois religion. His work ''Faith in History and Society'' develops apologetics, or fundamental theology, from this perspective.

Two of the other major developers of political theology in Germany were [[Jürgen Moltmann]] and [[Dorothee Sölle]]. As in Metz' work, the concept of a suffering God is important to Moltmann's theological program. Moltmann's political theology was influenced strongly by the Marxist philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]], and both Moltmann and Sölle were influenced heavily by [[liberation theology]], as was Metz. Another early influence was the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory]], especially [[Walter Benjamin]], and the Frankfurt School's broader critique of [[modernity]].{{sfn|Osborne|Charles|2015}}

=== Middle East ===
{{Main article|Political theology in the Middle East}}
Christian political theology in the [[Middle East]] is a religious response by Christian leaders and scholars to political problems.{{fact|date=March 2018}} Political theologians try to balance the demands of a tumultuous region with the delicate but long history of Christianity in the Middle East. This has yielded a diversity of political theology disproportionate to the small size of Middle East Christian minorities. The region's importance to Christians worldwide – both for history and doctrinal authority for many denominations – also shapes the political theologies of the Middle East.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

For many Christian leaders, the dominant approach to political theology is one of survival. Many [[Arab Christians]] see themselves as the heirs of a rich Christian heritage whose existence is threatened by regional unrest and religious persecution. Their chief political goal is survival, which sets their political theology apart.{{sfn|Wessels|1995|pp=203–227}}

At times, Arab Christian leaders have appealed to Christians outside the region through both denominational challenges and broader calls to Christian unity for humanitarian or political aid. In other cases, Christian politicians downplay their faith in the public sphere to avoid conflict with their Muslim neighbours.{{sfn|Cragg|1991|pp=143–227}}

In the mid-20th century, many Christians in the Middle East saw secular politics as a way out of their traditional status as a minority community in the Islamic world.{{sfn|Cragg|1991|pp=143–227}} Christians played prominent roles throughout the [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab nationalist]] movement in the mid-20th century, where their experience with Western politics and generally high educational attainments made their contributions valuable to nationalist governments around the region. One prominent example was [[Michel Aflaq]], an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christian]] who formed the first [[Ba'ath Party|Ba'ath]] group from students in Damascus in the 1940s. His belief was that Christians should embrace Islam as part of their cultural identity because nationalism was the best way for Christians to be successful in the Middle East.{{sfn|Cragg|1991|pp=143–227}}

=== Sub-Saharan Africa ===
{{Main article|Political theology in sub-Saharan Africa}}
Political theology in sub-Saharan Africa deals with the relationship of theology and politics, arising from the [[internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid struggle]] in [[South Africa]] and nationalist campaigns of the mid to late twentieth century elsewhere. The increasing numbers of Christians in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] has led to an increased interest in Christian responses to the region's continuing issues of poverty, violence, and war.{{sfn|Katongole|2010|pp=1–4, 22–23}} According to the Cameroonian theologian and sociologist [[Jean Marc Ela|Jean-Marc Éla]], African Christianity "has to be formulated from the struggles of our people, from their joys, from their pains, from their hopes and from their frustrations today."{{sfn|Stinton|2004|p=25}} African theology is heavily influenced by [[liberation theology]], global [[black theology]], and postcolonial theology.

Notable thinkers include [[Itumeleng Mosala]], [[Jesse Mugambi|Jesse N. K. Mugambi]], and [[Desmond Tutu]].

=== United States ===
[[Reinhold Niebuhr]] also developed a theology similar to Metz in the practical application of theology. During the 1930s, Niebuhr was a leader of the [[Socialist Party of America]], and although he broke with the party later in life socialist thought is a prominent component of his development of [[Christian Realism]]. The work by Niebuhr that best exemplifies his relationship with political theology is ''[[Moral Man and Immoral Society|Moral Man and Immoral Society: A Study of Ethics and Politics]]'' (1932).

One of the most influential developers of recent political theology is [[Stanley Hauerwas]], though he considers his work to be better termed a "theological politics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hauerwas |first=Stanley |author-link=Stanley Hauerwas |title=Bonhoeffer: The Truthful Witness |url=http://www.homileticsonline.com/subscriber/interviews/hauerwas.asp |website=Homiletics Online |access-date=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hauerwas has actively critiqued the political theology of both [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and [[H. Richard Niebuhr]], and has been a frequently critic of Christians' attempt to attain political power and align themselves with secular political ideologies. Moreoever, he has been a severe critic of [[liberal democracy]], [[capitalism]], and [[militarism]], arguing that all of those ideologies are antithetical to Christian convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hauerwas |first=Stanley |author-link=Stanley Hauerwas |year=2002 |title=Stanley Hauerwas: An Interview |url=http://www.crosscurrents.org/Hauerwasspring2002.htm |magazine=Cross Currents |volume=52 |issue=1 |interviewer-last=Quirk |interviewer-first=Michael J. |access-date=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''rally 'round the flag effect''' (or '''syndrome''') is a concept used in [[political science]] and [[international relations]] to explain increased short-run popular support of the [[President of the United States]] during periods of [[international crisis]] or [[war]].&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;Goldstein, Joshua S.; Pevehouse, Jon C. (2008). ''International Relations: Eighth Edition''. New York: Pearson Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; Because rally 'round The Flag effect can reduce criticism of governmental policies, it can be seen as a factor of [[diversionary foreign policy]].&lt;ref name="Goldstein"/&gt;

== Mueller's definition ==
Political scientist [[John Mueller]] suggested the effect in 1970, in a landmark paper called "Presidential Popularity from Truman to Johnson". He defined it as coming from an event with three qualities:&lt;ref name="Mueller"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mueller |first=John |title=Presidential Popularity from Truman to Johnson |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=18–34 |year=1970 |doi=10.2307/1955610 |jstor=1955610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#"Is international"
#"Involves the United States and particularly the President directly"
#"Specific, dramatic, and sharply focused"

In addition, Mueller created five categories of rallies. These categories are considered dated by modern political scientists, as they rely heavily on [[Cold War]] events.&lt;ref name="Hetherington"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hetherington|first=Marc J.|last2=Nelson|first2=Michael|date=2003|title=Anatomy of a Rally Effect: George W. Bush and the War on Terrorism|jstor=3649343|journal=PS: Political Science and Politics|volume=36|issue=1|pages=37–42|doi=10.1017/S1049096503001665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mueller's five categories are:

#"Sudden US military intervention" (e.g., [[Korean War]], [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]])
#"Major diplomatic actions" (e.g., [[Truman Doctrine]])
#"Dramatic technological developments" (e.g., [[Sputnik crisis|Sputnik]])
#"US-Soviet summit meetings" (e.g., [[Potsdam Conference]])
#"Major military developments in ongoing wars" (e.g., [[Tet Offensive]])

== Causes and durations ==
Since Mueller's original theories, two schools of thought have emerged to explain the causes of the effect. The first, "The Patriotism School of Thought" holds that in times of crisis, the American public sees the President as the embodiment of national unity. The second, "The Opinion Leadership School" believes that the rally emerges from a lack of criticism from members of the opposition party, most often in the [[United States Congress]]. If opposition party members appear to support the president, the media has no conflict to report, thus it appears to the public that all is well with the performance of the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker|first=William D.|last2=Oneal|first2=John R.|date=2001|title=Patriotism or Opinion Leadership?: The Nature and Origins of the 'Rally 'Round the Flag' Effect|jstor=3176318|journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=45|issue=5|pages=661–687|doi=10.1177/0022002701045005006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two theories have both been criticized, but it is generally accepted that the Patriotism School of thought is better to explain causes of rallies, while the Opinion Leadership School of thought is better to explain duration of rallies.&lt;ref name="Hetherington"/&gt; It is also believed that the lower the presidential approval rating before the crisis, the larger the increase will be in terms of percentage points because it leaves the president more room for improvement. For example, Franklin Roosevelt only had a 12% increase in approval from 72% to 84% following the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], whereas George W. Bush had a 39% increase from 51% to 90% following the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name="Chapman"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chapman |first1=Terrence L. |last2=Reiter |first2=Dan |authorlink2=Dan Reiter |year=2004 |title=The United Nations Security Council and the Rally 'Round the Flag Effect |journal=The Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=886–909 |jstor=4149799 |doi=10.1177/0022002704269353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory about the cause of the effect is believed to be embedded in the [[US Constitution]]. Unlike in other countries, the constitution makes the President both [[head of government]] and [[head of state]]. Because of this, the president receives a temporary boost in popularity because his Head of State role gives him symbolic importance to the American people. However, as time goes on his duties as Head of Government require partisan decisions that polarize opposition parties and diminish popularity. This theory falls in line more with the Opinion Leadership School.

Due to the highly statistical nature of presidential polls, University of Alabama political scientist John O'Neal has approached the study of rally 'round the flag using mathematics. O'Neal has postulated that the Opinion Leadership School is the more accurate of the two using mathematical equations. These equations are based on quantified factors such as the number of headlines from the [[New York Times]] about the crisis, the presence of bipartisan support or hostility, and prior popularity of the president.&lt;ref name="Lian"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lian |first1=Bradley |first2=John R. |last2=O'Neal |title=Presidents, the Use of Military Force, and Public Opinion |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=277–300 |year=1993 |jstor=174524 |doi=10.1177/0022002793037002003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political Scientist from [[University of California, Los Angeles|The University of California Los Angeles]], Matthew A. Baum found that the source of a rally 'round the flag effect is from independents and members of the opposition party shifting their support behind the President after the rallying effect. Baum also found that when the country is more divided or in a worse economic state then the rally effect is larger. This is because more people who are against the president before the rallying event switch to support him afterwards. When the country is divided before the rallying event there is a higher potential increase in support for the President after the rallying event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baum|first=Matthew A.|date=2002-06-01|title=The Constituent Foundations of the Rally-Round-the-Flag Phenomenon|journal=International Studies Quarterly|language=en|volume=46|issue=2|pages=263–298|doi=10.1111/1468-2478.00232|issn=1468-2478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study by Political Scientist Terrence L. Chapman and Dan Reiter, rallies in Presidential approval ratings were found to be bigger when there was U.N. Security Council supported Militarized interstate disputes (MIDs). Having U.N. Security Council support was found to increase the rally effect in presidential approval by 8 to 9 points compared to when there wasn't U.N. Security Council support.&lt;ref name="Chapman" /&gt;

== Historical examples ==
The effect has been examined within the context of nearly every major foreign policy crisis since [[World War II]]. Some notable examples:

*[[Cuban Missile Crisis]]: According to [[Gallup poll]]s, President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s approval rating in early October 1962 was at 61%. By November, after the crisis had passed, Kennedy's approval rose to 74%. The spike in approval peaked in December 1962 at 76%. Kennedy's approval rating slowly decreased again until it reached the pre-crisis level of 61% in June 1963.&lt;ref name="Hetherington"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Tom W.|date=2003|title=Trends: The Cuban Missile Crisis and U.S. Public Opinion|jstor=3521635|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=67|issue=2|pages=265–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Iran hostage crisis]]: According to Gallup polls, President [[Jimmy Carter]] quickly gained 26 percentage points, jumping from 32 to 58% approval following the initial seizure of the [[U.S. Embassy, Tehran|U.S. embassy in Tehran]] in November 1979. However, Carter's handling of the crisis caused popular support to decrease, and by November 1980 Carter had returned to his pre-crisis approval rating.&lt;ref name="Callaghan"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Callaghan |first1=Karen J. |first2=Simo |last2=Virtanen |title=Revised Models of the 'Rally Phenomenon': The Case of the Carter Presidency |journal=The Journal of Politics |volume=55 |issue=3 |year=1993 |pages=756–764 |jstor=2131999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]] ([[Persian Gulf War]]): According to Gallup polls, President [[George H. W. Bush]] was rated at 59% approval in January 1991, but following the success of Operation Desert Storm, Bush enjoyed a peak 89% approval rating in February 1991. From there, Bush's approval rating slowly decreased, reaching the pre-crisis level of 61% in October 1991.&lt;ref name="Hetherington"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/4912/bush-job-approval-reflects-record-rally-effect.aspx|title=Bush Job Approval Reflects Record 'Rally' Effect|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2017-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, President [[George W. Bush]] received an unprecedented increase in his approval rating. On September 10, Bush had a [[Gallup Poll]] rating of 51%. By September 15, his approval rate had increased by 34 percentage points to 85%. Just a week later, Bush was at 90%, the highest presidential approval rating ever. Over a year after the attacks occurred, Bush still received higher approval than he did before 9/11 (68% in November 2002). Both the size and duration of Bush's popularity after 9/11 are believed to be the largest of any post-crisis boost. Many people believe that this popularity gave Bush a mandate and eventually the political leverage to begin the [[War in Iraq]].&lt;ref name="Hetherington"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Curran"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Curran |first1=Margaret Ann |first2=James N. |last2=Schubert |first3=Patrick A. |last3=Stewart |title=A Defining Presidential Moment: 9/11 and the Rally Effect |journal=Political Psychology |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=559–583 |year=2002 |jstor=3792592 |doi=10.1111/0162-895X.00298}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Death of Osama bin Laden]]: According to Gallup polls, President [[Barack Obama]] received a 6% jump in his Presidential approving ratings, jumping from 46% in the three days before the mission (April 29 – May 1) to a 52% in the 3 days after the mission (May 2–4).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/147437/obama-approval-rallies-six-points-bin-laden-death.aspx|title=Obama Approval Rallies Six Points to 52% After Bin Laden Death|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2017-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rally effect didn't last long, as Obama's approval ratings were back down to 46% by June 30.

== Controversy and Fears of Misuse ==
There are fears that the president will misuse the rally 'round the flag effect. These fears come from the [[Diversionary foreign policy|"diversionary theory of war"]] in which the President creates an international crisis in order to distract from domestic affairs and to increase their approval ratings through a rally 'round the flag effect. The fear associated with this theory is that a President can create international crisis to avoid dealing with serious domestic issues or to increase their approval rating when it begins to drop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Territorial Diversion: Diversionary Theory of War and Territorial Conflict|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume=72|issue=2|year=2010|pages=413–425|jstor=10.1017/s0022381609990879|doi=10.1017/s0022381609990879|last1=Tir|first1=Jaroslav}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tragedy of '''  Rostam and Sohrab''' forms part of the 10th-century Persian epic [[Shahnameh]] by the [[Persian literature|Persian poet]] [[Ferdowsi]]. It tells the tragic story of the heroes [[Rostam]] and his son, [[Sohrab]].

==Plot==
Rostam lived in [[Sistan]], [[Iran]] (also known as [[Persia]]), hero and one of the favorites of King [[Kay Kāvus|Kaykavous]]. Once, following the traces of his lost horse, he enters the kingdom of [[Samangan]] where he becomes the guest of the king during the search for his horse. There, Rostam meets princess [[Tahmina]]. She admires Rostam and knows of his reputation. She goes into his room at night and asks if he will give her a child and in return, she will bring his horse. Rostam leaves after he impregnates Tahmina and his horse is returned. Before he leaves, he gives her two tokens. If she has a girl, she is to take the jewel and plait it in the girl's hair. If she has a boy, she is to take the seal and bind it on the boy's arm. Nine months later, she bears his child—a son, whom she later names Sohrab. Years go by before Rostam and Sohrab meet. Finally, a new war between [[Persia]] and [[Turan]] is on the horizon. The two armies face each other and prepare for the imminent battle. By then, Sohrab has become known as the best fighter of Turan army. But Rostam's legend precedes him and the Turan army cowers before the hero. No one else dares to fight Rostam, so Sohrab is sent to wrestle with the legendary Khurasaan hero. Though Sohrab knows his father's name, he is unaware that the man before him is Rostam. On the battlefield, Rostam and Sohrab fight for what seems like an eternity, neither knowing the true name of his opponent.

After a very long and heavy bout of wrestling, Rostam breaks Sohrab's back and stabs him. Sohrab, dying, tells Rostam that his father will avenge his death and only then do they realize their identities. Sohrab produces the necklace that Rostam once gave Tahmina, who gave it to her son to keep him safe during the war. Rostam grieves heavily but cannot save his son. When she finds out her son is dead, Tahmina burns Sohrab's house and gives away all his riches. Then "the breath departed from out her body, and her spirit went forth after Sohrab her son."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Ferdowsi/kings.8.rustemsohrab.html|title=The Internet Classics Archive - The Epic of Kings by Ferdowsi|author=|date=|website=classics.mit.edu|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''''Shuowen Jiezi''''' ({{zh|t=說文解字|l=Explaining Graphs and Analyzing Characters}}) was an early 2nd-century [[Chinese dictionary]] from the [[Han Dynasty]]. Although not the first comprehensive [[Chinese character]] dictionary (the ''[[Erya]]'' predates it), it was the first to analyze the structure of the characters and to give the rationale behind them, as well as the first to use the principle of organization by sections with shared components, called [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] (''bùshǒu'' 部首, lit. "section headers").

==Circumstances of compilation==

[[Xu Shen]], a Han Dynasty scholar of the [[Five Classics]], compiled the ''Shuowen Jiezi''. He finished editing it in 100, but due to an unfavorable imperial attitude towards scholarship, he waited until 121 before having his son Xǔ Chōng present it to [[Emperor An of Han]] along with a memorial.

In analyzing the structure of characters and defining the words represented by them, Xu Shen strove to disambiguate the meaning of the pre-Han Classics, so as to render their usage by government unquestioned and bring about order, and in the process also deeply imbued his organization and analyses with his philosophy on characters and the universe. According to Boltz (1993:430), Xu's compilation of the ''Shuowen'' "cannot be held to have arisen from a purely linguistic or lexicographical drive." His motives were more pragmatic and political. During the Han era, the prevalent theory of language was Confucianist [[Rectification of Names]], the belief that using the correct names for things was essential for proper government. The [[postface]] (''xù'' 敘) to the ''Shuowen Jiezi'' (tr. Thern 1966:17) explains: "Now the written language is the foundation of classical learning, the source of kingly government." Compare how the postface describes the legendary invention of writing for governmental rather than for communicative purposes: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Cang Jie]], scribe for the Yellow Emperor, on looking at the tracks of the feet of birds and animals, realizing that the patterns and forms were distinguishable, started to create graphs, so that all kinds of professions could be regulated, and all people could be kept under scrutiny. (tr. Thern 1966:17)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pre-''Shuowen'' Chinese dictionaries like the ''[[Erya]]'' and the ''[[Fangyan]]'' were limited lists of synonyms loosely organized by semantic categories, which made it difficult to look up characters. Xu Shen analytically organized characters in the comprehensive ''Shuowen Jiezi'' through their shared graphic components, which Boltz (1993:431) calls "a major conceptual innovation in the understanding of the Chinese writing system."

==Structure==

[[Image:The 540 Shuowen Seal Radicals - numbered.svg|thumb|The 540 radicals of the ''Shuowen Jiezi'' in the original [[seal script]]]]
Xu wrote the ''Shuowen Jiezi'' to analyze [[seal script]] (specifically ''xiǎozhuàn'' 小篆 "small seal") characters that evolved slowly and organically throughout the mid-to-late Zhou dynasty in the state of Qin, and which were then standardized during the [[Qin dynasty]] and promulgated empire-wide. Thus, Needham et al. (1986: 217) describe the ''Shuowen jiezi'' as "a paleographic handbook as well as a dictionary".

The dictionary includes a preface and 15 chapters. The first 14 chapters are character entries; the 15th and final chapter is divided into two parts: a postface and an index of section headers. Xǔ Shèn states in his postface that the dictionary has 9,353 character entries, plus 1,163 graphic variants, with a total length of 133,441 characters. The transmitted texts vary slightly in content, owing to omissions and emendations by commentators (especially Xú Xuàn, see below), and modern editions have 9,831 characters and 1,279 variants.

===Sections===

{{see also|List of Shuowen Jiezi radicals}}
Xu Shen categorized Chinese characters into 540 sections, under "section headers" (''bùshǒu'', now the standard linguistic and lexicographical term for character [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]]): these may be entire characters or simplifications thereof, which also serve as components shared by all the characters in that section.  The number of section headers, 540, [[Numerology|numerologically]] equals 6 × 9 × 10, the product of the symbolic numbers of [[Yin and Yang]] and the number of the [[Heavenly Stems]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}  The first section header was 一 (''yī'' "one; first") and the last was 亥 (''hài'', the last character of the [[Earthly Branches]]).

Xu's choice of sections appears in large part to have been driven by the desire to create an unbroken, systematic sequence among the headers themselves, such that each had a natural, intuitive relationship (e.g., structural, [[semantic]] or [[phonetic]]) with the ones before and after, as well as by the desire to reflect [[cosmology]]. In the process, he included many section headers that are not considered ones today, such as 炎 (''yán'' "flame") and 熊 (''xióng'' "bear"), which modern dictionaries list under the 火 or 灬 (''huǒ'' "fire") heading. He also included as section headers all the [[sexagenary cycle]] characters, that is, the ten Heavenly Stems and twelve Earthly Branches. As a result, unlike modern dictionaries which attempt to maximize the number of characters under each section header, 34 ''Shuowen'' headers have no characters under them, while 159 have only one each. From a modern lexicographical perspective, Xu's system of 540 headings can seem "enigmatic" and "illogical".{{sfn|Thern|1966|p=4}} For instance, he included the singular section header 409 惢 (''ruǐ'' "doubt"), with only one rare character (''ruǐ'' 繠 "stamen"), instead of listing it under the common header 408 心 (''xīn'' "heart; mind").

===Character entries===

[[File:Shuowen-子.png|thumb|right|upright|Entry for 子 ''zǐ'' "child", showing the [[Small Seal Script|small seal]] form (top right), with the "ancient script" and ''Zhòuwén'' forms on the left{{sfn|Qiu|2000|p=73}}]]
The typical ''Shuowen'' format for a character entry consists of a seal graph, a short definition (usually a single [[synonym]], occasionally [[Shengxun|in a punning way]] as in the ''[[Shiming]]''), a pronunciation given by citing a [[homophone]], and analysis of compound graphs into semantic and/or phonetic components. Individual entries can additionally include graphic variants, secondary definitions, information on regional usages, citations from pre-Han texts, and further phonetic information, typically in ''dúruò'' (讀若 "read like") notation.{{sfn|Coblin|1978}}
In addition to the seal graph, Xu included two kinds of variant graphs when they differed from the standard seal, called ''ancient script'' (''gǔwén'' 古文) and ''Zhòu script'' (''Zhòuwén'' 籀文, not to be confused with the [[Zhou dynasty]]).

The ''Zhòu'' characters were taken from the no-longer extant ''[[Shizhoupian]]'', an early copybook traditionally attributed to a Shĭ Zhòu, or Historian Zhou, in the court of [[King Xuan of Zhou]] (r. 827–782 BCE). [[Wang Guowei]] and Tang Lan argued that the structure and style of these characters suggested a later date, but some modern scholars such as [[Qiu Xigui]] argue for the original dating.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|pp=72–77}}

The ''guwen'' characters were based on the characters used in pre-Qin copies of the classics recovered from the walls of houses where they had been hidden to escape the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|burning of books]] ordered by [[Qin Shihuang]].  Xu believed that these were the most ancient characters available, since [[Confucius]] would have used the oldest characters to best convey the meaning of the texts.  However, Wang Guowei and other scholars have shown that they were regional variant forms in the eastern areas during the [[Warring States period]], from only slightly earlier than the Qin seal script.{{sfn|Qiu|2000|pp=82–83}}

Even as copyists transcribed the main text of the book in [[clerical script]] in the late Han, and then in modern standard script in the centuries to follow, the small seal characters continued to be copied in their own (seal) script to preserve their structure, as were the ''guwen'' and ''Zhouwen'' characters.

===Character analysis===

[[File:Shuowen-Shuo.png|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=page of a Chinese dictionary, with headings in seal script and entries in conventional script|Page from a copy of a [[Song dynasty]] edition of the ''Shuowen'', showing characters with the 言 element, including 說 ''shuō'']]
The title of the work draws a basic distinction between two types of characters, ''wén'' 文 and ''zì'' 字, the former being those composed of a single graphic element (such as ''shān'' 山 "mountain"), and the latter being those containing more than one such element (such as ''hǎo'' 好 "good" with 女 "woman" and 子 "child") which can be deconstructed into and analyzed in terms of their component elements. Note that the character 文 itself exemplifies the category ''wén'' 文, while 字 (which is composed of 宀 and 子) exemplifies ''zì'' 字. Thus, ''Shuōwén Jiězì'' means "commenting on" (''shuō'' "speak; talk; comment; explain") the ''wén'', which cannot be deconstructed, and "analyzing" (''jiě'' "untie; separate; divide; analyze; explain; deconstruct") the ''zì''.{{sfn|Boltz|1993|p=431}}

Although the "six principles" of [[Chinese character classification]] (''liùshū'' 六書 "six graphs") had been mentioned by earlier authors, Xu Shen's postface was the first work to provide definitions and examples. He uses the first two terms, simple indicatives (''zhǐshì'' 指事) and pictograms (''xiàngxíng'' 象形) to explicitly label character entries in the dictionary, e.g., in the typical pattern of "(character) (definition) ...simple indicative" (A B 也...指事 (也)).{{sfn|Boltz|1993|p=432}} Logographs belonging to the third principle, phono-semantic compound characters (''xíngshēng'' 形聲), are implicitly identified through the entry pattern ''A… from B, phonetically resembles C'' (''A...從 B, C 聲''), meaning that element B plays a semantic role in A, while C gives the sound.{{sfn|Boltz|1993|pp=432–433}} The fourth type, compound indicatives (''huìyì'' 會意), are sometimes identified by the pattern ''A...from X from Y'' (''A...從 X 從 Y''), meaning that the compound A is given meaning through the graphic combination and interaction of both constituent elements. The last two of the six principles, borrowed characters (aka phonetic loan, ''jiǎjiè'' 假借) and derived characters (''zhuǎnzhù'' 轉注), are not identifiable in the character definitions.{{sfn|Boltz|1993|p=433}}

According to [[Imre Galambos]], the function of the ''Shuowen'' was educational. Since Han studies of writing are attested to have begun by pupils of 8 years old, Xu Shen's categorization of characters was proposed to be understood as a mnemonic methodology for juvenile students.{{sfn|Galambos|2006|pp=54–61}}

==Textual history and scholarship==

Although the original Han dynasty ''Shuōwén Jiězì'' text has been lost, it was transmitted through handwritten copies for centuries. The oldest extant trace of it is a six-page manuscript fragment from the [[Tang dynasty]], amounting to about 2% of the entire text. The fragment, now in Japan, concerns the ''mù'' (木) section header. The earliest post-Han scholar known to have researched and emended this dictionary, albeit badly, was Lǐ Yángbīng (李陽冰, fl. 765–780), who "is usually regarded as something of a ''bête noire'' of [''Shuowen''] studies," writes Boltz, "owing to his idiosyncratic and somewhat capricious editing of the text."{{sfn|Boltz|1993|p=435}}

''Shuowen'' scholarship improved greatly during the [[Southern Tang]]-[[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties and later during the [[Qing dynasty]]. The most important Northern Song scholars were the Xú brothers, Xú Xuàn (徐鉉, 916–991) and Xú Kǎi (徐鍇, 920–974). In 986, [[Emperor Taizong of Song]] ordered Xú Xuàn and other editors to publish an authoritative edition of the dictionary. Xu Xuan's textual criticism has been especially vital for all subsequent scholarship, since his restoration of the damage done by Lǐ Yángbīng resulted in the closest version we have to the original, and the basis for all later editions. Xu Kai, in turn, focused on exegetical study, analyzing the meaning of Xu Shen's text, appending supplemental characters, and adding [[fanqie|fǎnqiè]] pronunciation glosses for each entry. Among Qing ''Shuowen'' scholars, some like Zhū Jùnshēng (朱駿聲, 1788–1858), followed the textual criticism model of Xu Xuan, while others like Guì Fù (桂馥, 1736–1805) and Wáng Yún (王筠, 1784–1834) followed the analytical exegesis model of Xu Kai. One Qing scholar, [[Duan Yucai]], stands above all the others due to the quality of his research in both areas. His annotated ''Shuowen'' edition is the one most commonly used by students today.

Although the ''Shuowen Jiezi'' has had incalculable value to scholars and was traditionally relied upon as the most important early source on the structure of Chinese characters, many of its analyses and definitions have been eclipsed as vague or inaccurate since the discovery of [[oracle bone inscriptions]] in the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} It therefore can no longer be relied upon as the single, authoritative source for definitions and graphic derivations. Xu Shen lacked access to oracle bone inscriptions from the [[Shang dynasty]] and [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|bronzeware inscriptions]] from the Shang and [[Western Zhou dynasty]], to which scholars now have access; they are often critical for understanding the structures and origins of logographs. For instance, he put ''lǜ'' (慮 "be concerned; consider") under the section heading 思 (''sī'' "think") and noted it had a phonetic of ''hǔ'' (虍 "tiger"). However, the early bronze graphs for ''lǜ'' (慮) have the ''xīn'' (心 "heart") semantic component and a ''lǚ'' (呂 "a musical pitch") phonetic, also seen in early forms of ''lǔ'' (盧 "vessel; hut") and ''lǔ'' (虜 "captive").

Scholarship in the 20th century offered new understandings and accessibility. [[Ding Fubao]] collected all available ''Shuowen'' materials, clipped and arranged them in the original dictionary order, and photolithographically printed a colossal edition. Notable advances in ''Shuowen'' research have been made by Chinese and Western scholars like Mǎ Zōnghuò (馬宗霍), Mǎ Xùlún (馬敘倫), William G. Boltz, [[Weldon South Coblin]], Thomas B.I. Creamer, [[Paul Serruys]], [[Roy A. Miller]], and K.L. Thern.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36318">A '''sobriquet''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|oʊ|b|r|ᵻ|k|eɪ}} {{respell|SOH|bri-kay}}) or '''soubriquet''' is a [[nickname]], sometimes assumed, but often given by another. Distinct from a [[pseudonym]], it usually is a familiar name used in place of a real name without the need of explanation, often becoming more familiar than the original name.

Examples are Emiye Menelik, a name of Emperor [[Menelik II]] of [[Ethiopia]], who was popularly and affectionately recognized for his kindness ('emiye' means mother in [[Amharic]]); [[Genghis Khan]], who now is rarely recognized by his original name, Temüjin; and Mohandas Gandhi, who is better known as [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. Well-known places often have sobriquets, such as [[New York City]], often referred to as the [[Big Apple]]. Hence, ''sobriquet'' may apply to the nickname for a specific person, group of people, or place.

== Etymology ==

Two early variants of the term are found, ''sotbriquet'' and ''soubriquet''; often, the latter form is still used. The modern [[French language|French]] spelling is ''sobriquet''. The first form suggests derivation from ''sot'', foolish, and the second form, ''briquet'', is a French adaptation of Italian ''brichetto'', diminutive of ''bricco'', ass,{{clarify|date=January 2015}} knave, possibly connected with ''briccone'', rogue, which is supposed to be a derivative of the [[German language|German]] ''brechen'', to break; but [[Walter William Skeat|Skeat]] considers this spelling to be an example of [[false etymology]]. The real origin is to be sought in the form ''soubriquet''.

[[Émile Littré|Littré]] gives an early fourteenth century ''soubsbriquet'' as meaning a chuck under the chin, and this would be derived from ''soubs'', mod. ''sous'' ([[Latin|Lat.]] ''sub''), under, and ''briquet'' or ''bruchel'', the brisket, or lower part of the throat.

== Use ==

Sobriquets often are found in music, sports, and politics. Candidates and political figures often are branded with sobriquets, either while living or posthumously. For example, [[president of the United States]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] came to be known as "Honest Abe". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/honest-abe-wasnt-always-quite-so-honest-180962194/|title=When Lincoln Was More a Politician Than an "Honest Abe"|last=Mansky|first=Jackie|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' (1926) warned, "Now the sobriquet habit is not a thing to be acquired, but a thing to be avoided; &amp; the selection that follows is compiled for the purpose not of assisting but of discouraging it." Fowler included the sobriquet among what he termed the "battered ornaments" of the language, but opinion on their use varies. Sobriquets remain a common feature of speech today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5252">The '''Survey of English Usage''' was the first research centre in Europe to carry out research with [[Corpus linguistics|corpora]]. The Survey is based in the Department of English Language and Literature at [[University College London]].

== History ==

The Survey of English Usage was founded in 1959 by [[Randolph Quirk|Randolph (now Lord) Quirk]]. Many well-known linguists have spent time doing research at the Survey, including Bas Aarts, Valerie Adams, John Algeo, Dwight Bolinger, Noël Burton-Roberts, [[David Crystal]], Derek Davy, Jan Firbas, [[Sidney Greenbaum]], Liliane Haegeman, Robert Ilson, Ruth Kempson, [[Geoffrey Leech]], Jan Rusiecki, Jan Svartvik, and Joe Taglicht. The current Director is Bas Aarts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Survey Staff | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/staff/index.htm | publisher=[[University College London]] | accessdate=14 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original '''Survey Corpus''' predated modern computing. It was recorded on reel-to-reel tapes, transcribed on paper, filed in filing cabinets, and indexed on paper cards. Transcriptions were annotated with a detailed [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] and [[Paralanguage|paralinguistic]] annotation developed by Crystal and Quirk (1964).&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David, and Quirk, Randolph (1964). ''Systems of Prosodic and Paralinguistic Features in English''. The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; Sets of paper cards were manually annotated for grammatical structures and filed, so, for example, all noun phrases could be found in the noun phrase filing cabinet in the Survey. Naturally, corpus searches required a visit to the Survey.

This corpus is now known more widely as the '''London-Lund Corpus''' (LLC), as it was the responsibility of co-workers in Lund, Sweden, to computerise the corpus. Thirty-four of the spoken texts were published in book form as Svartvik and Quirk (1980),&lt;ref&gt;Svartvik, Jan and Quirk, Randolph (1980) (eds.). ''A Corpus of English Conversation'' Lund: CWK Gleerup.&lt;/ref&gt; and the corpus was used as the basis for the famous ''Comprehensive Grammar'' (Quirk ''et al.'' 1985).&lt;ref&gt;Quirk, Randolph, Greenbaum, Sidney, Leech, Geoffrey and Svartvik, Jan (1985). ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'' London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current research ==

=== Constructing corpora ===

In 1988 Sidney Greenbaum proposed a new project, '''ICE''', the [[International Corpus of English]]. ICE was to be an international project, carried out at research centres around the world, to compile corpora of English varieties where English was the first or second official language. ICE texts would contain spoken and written English in a balanced sample of one million words per component so that these samples could be compared in a wide varieties of ways. The ICE project continues around the world to the present day.

'''ICE-GB''', the British Component of ICE, was compiled at the Survey. ICE-GB was annotated to a very detailed level, including constructing a full grammatical analysis (parse) for every sentence in the corpus. The first release of ICE-GB took place in 1998. ICE-GB was distributed with software for searching and exploring the [[parsed corpus]] called ICECUP. Release 2 of ICE-GB has now been released and is available on CD.

As well as contrasting varieties of English, many researchers are interested in language development and change over time. A recent project at the Survey undertook the parsing of a large (400,000 word) selection of the spoken part of the LLC in a manner directly comparable with ICE-GB, forming a new, 800,000 word diachronic corpus, called the  Diachronic Corpus of Present-Day Spoken English ('''DCPSE'''). DCPSE has now been released and is available on CD from the Survey.

These two corpora comprise the largest collection of parsed and corrected, orthographically transcribed spoken English language data in the world, with over one million words of spoken English in this form.

=== Exploring corpora ===

[[Treebank|Parsed corpora]] are large databases containing detailed grammatical tree structures. One of the consequences of forming large collections of valuable linguistic data is a pressing need for methods and tools to help researchers and other users make the most of them. So in parallel with the parsing of natural language data, the Survey team have carried out research and development of software tools to help linguists use these corpora. The ICECUP research platform uses an intuitive grammatical query representation called Fuzzy Tree Fragments (FTFs) to search parsed corpora.

=== Linguistic research with corpora ===

As well as distributing corpora and tools to the [[corpus linguistics]] research community, the SEU carries out research into English language. Recent projects include research on the English Noun Phrase, Subordination in Spoken and Written English, and the English Verb Phrase. The Survey also provides support for PhD students who carry out research into English language corpora.

The '''Sycuan Institute on Tribal Gaming''' at the [[San Diego State University]] [[San Diego State University College of Professional Studies &amp; Fine Arts|College of Professional Studies &amp; Fine Arts]] "focuses," its own words, "on research, policy studies, and education related to the area of [[Native American gambling enterprises|tribal gaming]] management." As the institute's website goes on to put it: "The Institute, centered in the largest tribal [[gambling]] community in the world, is geared to studying tribal gaming within the broader industry of [[hospitality]] and [[tourism management]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://htm.sdsu.edu/degrees/htm#tribal-gaming&lt;/ref&gt;

In conjunction with educating students, professionals, tribal personnel and interested others for positions in the tribal gaming industry, the Institute conducts [[research]] in tribal gaming and collects [[benchmarking]] data. It holds an annual summit on tribal gaming that addresses policy, regulatory issues, trends, social issues and related matters, and conducts community lectures and symposia on topics geared to informing and engaging the community about tribal issues and community conflicts.

==Endowment and administration==
The Institute is managed and operated by the interdisciplinary Hospitality and Tourism Management Program at SDSU and supported by an endowment from the [[tribal council]] of the [[Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation]]. The endowment was established in 2005 with a $5 million gift from the Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation, and continual payments of $474,000 on a yearly basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://larsperner.com/pdf/NativeStudents.pdf|title=Leveraging the SDSU-Sycuan Institute on Tribal Gaming to Attract and Support More Native American Students: Some Preliminary Thoughts|work=Lars Perner, Ph.D., Asst.

==Academic curriculum==
Under the terms of the endowment, the Institute has created an academic curriculum leading to a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[Hospitality and Tourism Management]] with an emphasis in Tribal Casino Operations Management. The courses include casino operations, casino marketing and public relations, legal and regulatory issues and an introduction to tribal gaming's social, political and cultural context, along with elective courses on responsible gaming.

==Research center==
The Research Center is the portion "of the Institute that is focused on producing and disseminating unbiased research on tribal government gaming issues."&lt;ref&gt;http://htm.sdsu.edu/web/index.php/centers/sycuan_research_center&lt;/ref&gt;

He became a [[British subject]] in 1927 at the age of 39, renouncing his American passport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sanna|first=Ellyn|chapter=Biography of T. S.

Eliot attracted widespread attention for his poem "[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]" (1915), which was seen as a masterpiece of the [[Modernist poetry in English|Modernist]] movement. It was followed by some of the best-known poems in the English language, including ''[[The Waste Land]]'' (1922), "[[The Hollow Men]]" (1925), "[[Ash Wednesday (poem)|Ash Wednesday]]" (1930), and ''[[Four Quartets]]'' (1943).&lt;ref name=EB&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/184705/T-S-Eliot "Thomas Stearns Eliot"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', accessed 7 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known for his seven plays, particularly ''[[Murder in the Cathedral]]'' (1935) and ''[[The Cocktail Party]]'' (1949). He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1948, "for his outstanding, pioneer contribution to present-day poetry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1948/|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1948|work=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nobelprize&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1948/eliot-bio.html "The Nobel Prize in Literature 1948 – T.S.

==Life==

===Early life and education===
The [[Eliot family (America)|Eliots]] were a [[Boston Brahmin]] family with roots in [[England|Old]] and [[New England]]. Thomas Eliot's paternal grandfather, [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], had moved to [[St. Louis, Missouri]],&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bush, Ronald, ''T. S. Eliot: The Modernist in History'' (New York, 1991), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; to establish a Unitarian Christian church there. His father, [[Henry Ware Eliot]] (1843–1919), was a successful businessman, president and treasurer of the Hydraulic-Press Brick Company in St Louis. His mother, [[Charlotte Champe Stearns]] (1843–1929), wrote poetry and was a [[social worker]], a new profession in the early 20th century.

Eliot was the last of six surviving children; his parents were both 44 years old when he was born. Eliot was born at 2635 Locust Street, a property owned by his grandfather, William Greenleaf Eliot.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/LiterarySt.Louis|title=Literary St. Louis|last=|first=|publisher=Associates of St. Louis University Libraries, Inc. and Landmarks Association of St. Louis, Inc.|year=1969|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His four sisters were between 11 and 19 years older; his brother was eight years older. Known to family and friends as Tom, he was the namesake of his maternal grandfather, Thomas Stearns.

Eliot's childhood infatuation with literature can be ascribed to several factors. Firstly, he had to overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double [[inguinal hernia]], he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socializing with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books and was absorbed in tales depicting savages, the Wild West, or [[Mark Twain]]'s thrill-seeking [[Tom Sawyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S. Eliot: A Short Biography|year=2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot "would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sencourt|first=Robert|title=T.S. Eliot, A Memoir|year=1971|publisher=Garnstone Limited|location=London|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: "It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I feel that there is something in having passed one's childhood beside the [[Mississippi River|big river]], which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Marquis Childs quoted in ''St. Louis Post Dispatch'' (15 October 1930) and in the address "American Literature and the American Language" delivered at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] (9 June 1953), published in Washington University Studies, ''New Series: Literature and Language'', no. 23 (St. Louis: Washington University Press, 1953), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1898 to 1905, Eliot attended [[Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School|Smith Academy]], where his studies included Latin, Ancient Greek, French, and German. He began to write poetry when he was fourteen under the influence of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]'s ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', a translation of the poetry of [[Omar Khayyam]]. He said the results were gloomy and despairing and he destroyed them.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, Donald. [http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4738/the-art-of-poetry-no-1-t-s-eliot The Art of Poetry No. 1], ''The Paris Review'', Issue 21, Spring–Summer 1959, accessed 29 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His first published poem, "A Fable For Feasters", was written as a school exercise and was published in the ''Smith Academy Record'' in February 1905.&lt;ref name=Gallup&gt;Gallup, Donald. ''T. S. Eliot: A Bibliography (A Revised and Extended Edition)'', Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, New York, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Gallup, p.195 --&gt; Also published there in April 1905 was his oldest surviving poem in manuscript, an untitled lyric, later revised and reprinted as "Song" in ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', [[Harvard University]]'s student magazine.&lt;ref name=earlyyouth&gt;Eliot, T.S. ''Poems Written in Early Youth'', [[John Davy Hayward]], ed. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- pp.33-4 --&gt; He also published three short stories in 1905, "Birds of Prey", "A Tale of a Whale" and "The Man Who Was King". The last mentioned story significantly reflects his exploration of [[Igorot]] Village while visiting the [[1904 World's Fair]] of St. Louis.&lt;ref&gt;Narita, Tatsushi, "The Young T. S. Eliot and Alien Cultures: His Philippine Interactions", ''The Review of English Studies'', New Series, vol. 45, no. 180, 1994, pp. 523–525.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Narita, Tatsush, ''T. S. Eliot, The World Fair of St. Louis and "Autonomy"'', Nagoya: Kougaku Shuppan (2013), pp. 9–104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bush, Ronald, "The Presence of the Past: Ethnographic Thinking/ Literary Politics", in Elzar Barkan and Ronald Bush (eds), ''Prehistories of the Future'', Stanford University Press,(1995), pp. 3–5; 25–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a link with primitive people importantly antedates his anthropological studies at Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Alex, and Elizabeth Daumer, "Pound and T. S. Eliot", ''American Literary Scholarship'', 2005, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliot lived in St. Louis, Missouri for the first sixteen years of his life at the house on Locust St. where he was born. After going away to school in 1905, he only returned to St. Louis for vacations and visits. Despite moving away from the city, Eliot wrote to a friend that the "Missouri and the Mississippi have made a deeper impression on me than any other part of the world."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Following graduation, Eliot attended [[Milton Academy]] in [[Massachusetts]] for a preparatory year, where he met [[Scofield Thayer]] who later published ''[[The Waste Land]]''. He studied philosophy at [[Harvard College]] from 1906 to 1909, earning his [[bachelor's degree]] after three years, instead of the usual four.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; While a student, Eliot was placed on academic probation and graduated with a pass degree (i.e. no honours). He recovered and persisted, attaining a B.A. in an elective program best described as comparative literature in three years, and an M.A. in English literature in the fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/eliot/life.htm|title=T.S. Eliot's Life and Career|publisher=english.illinois.edu|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Kermode]] writes that the most important moment of Eliot's undergraduate career was in 1908 when he discovered [[Arthur Symons]]'s ''[[The Symbolist Movement in Literature]]''. This introduced him to [[Jules Laforgue]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]], and [[Paul Verlaine]]. Without Verlaine, Eliot wrote, he might never have heard of [[Tristan Corbière]] and his book ''Les amours jaunes'', a work that affected the course of Eliot's life.&lt;ref name=Kermode/&gt; The ''Harvard Advocate'' published some of his poems and he became lifelong friends with [[Conrad Aiken]], the American writer and critic.

After working as a philosophy assistant at Harvard from 1909 to 1910, Eliot moved to Paris where, from 1910 to 1911, he studied philosophy at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. He attended lectures by [[Henri Bergson]] and read poetry with [[Henri Alban-Fournier]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kermode&gt;Kermode, Frank. "Introduction" to ''The Waste Land and Other Poems'', Penguin Classics, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1911 to 1914, he was back at Harvard studying Indian philosophy and [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perl, Jeffry M., and Andrew P.

Eliot's Indic Studies"], ''Philosophy East &amp; West'' V. 35, No. 2, April 1985, pp. 116–131.&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot was awarded a scholarship to [[Merton College, Oxford]], in 1914. He first visited [[Marburg]], Germany, where he planned to take a summer programme, but when the [[First World War]] broke out he went to Oxford instead. At the time so many American students attended Merton that the [[Junior Common Room]] proposed a motion "that this society abhors the [[Americanization]] of Oxford". It was defeated by two votes, after Eliot reminded the students how much they owed American culture.&lt;ref name=SeymourJones1&gt;Seymour-Jones, Carole.

Eliot wrote to Conrad Aiken on New Year's Eve 1914: "I hate university towns and university people, who are the same everywhere, with pregnant wives, sprawling children, many books and hideous pictures on the walls ... Oxford is very pretty, but I don't like to be dead."&lt;ref name=SeymourJones1/&gt; Escaping Oxford, Eliot spent much of his time in London. This city had a monumental and life-altering effect on Eliot for several reasons, the most significant of which was his introduction to the influential American literary figure [[Ezra Pound]]. A connection through Aiken resulted in an arranged meeting and on 22 September 1914, Eliot paid a visit to Pound's flat. Pound instantly deemed Eliot "worth watching" and was crucial to Eliot's beginning career as a poet, as he is credited with promoting Eliot through social events and literary gatherings. Thus, according to biographer John Worthen, during his time in England Eliot "was seeing as little of Oxford as possible". He was instead spending long periods of time in London, in the company of Ezra Pound and "some of the modern artists whom the war has so far spared... It was Pound who helped most, introducing him everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Worthen|first=John|title=T.S. Eliot: A Short Biography|year=2009|publisher=Haus Publishing|location=London|pages=34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Eliot did not settle at Merton and left after a year. In 1915 he taught English at [[Birkbeck, University of London]].

By 1916, he had completed a doctoral dissertation for Harvard on "Knowledge and Experience in the Philosophy of [[F. H. Bradley]]", but he failed to return for the ''[[Oral exam|viva voce]]'' exam.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a reading of the dissertation, see {{Cite journal  | last = Brazeal  | first = Gregory  | title = The Alleged Pragmatism of T.S.

===Marriage===
[[File:Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot 1920.jpg|thumb|[[Vivienne Haigh-Wood Eliot]], passport photograph from 1920. ]]
In a letter to Aiken late in December 1914, Eliot, aged 26, wrote, "I am very dependent upon women (I mean female society)."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, T. S. ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot, Volume 1, 1898–1922''. p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Less than four months later, Thayer introduced Eliot to [[Vivienne Haigh-Wood]], a Cambridge [[governess]]. They were married at Hampstead Register Office on 26 June 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Richardson (art historian)|Richardson, John]], ''Sacred Monsters, Sacred Masters''. Random House, 2001, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short visit alone to his family in the United States, Eliot returned to London and took several teaching jobs, such as lecturing at  [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]], [[University of London]]. The philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] took an interest in Vivienne while the newlyweds stayed in his flat. Some scholars have suggested that she and Russell had an affair, but the allegations were never confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour-Jones, Carole. ''Painted Shadow: A Life of Vivienne Eliot''. Knopf Publishing Group, 2001, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage was markedly unhappy, in part because of Vivienne's health issues. In a letter addressed to Ezra Pound, she covers an extensive list of her symptoms, which included a habitually high temperature, [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[insomnia]], [[migraine]]s, and [[colitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Letters of T.S. Eliot: Volume 1, 1898–1922|year=1988|publisher=Faber and Faber|location=London|pages=533}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, coupled with apparent mental instability, meant that she was often sent away by Eliot and her doctors for extended periods of time in the hope of improving her health, and as time went on, he became increasingly detached from her. The couple formally separated in 1933 and in 1938 Vivienne's brother, Maurice, had her committed to a lunatic asylum, against her will, where she remained until her death of heart disease in 1947. Their relationship became the subject of a 1984 play ''[[Tom &amp; Viv (play)|Tom &amp; Viv]]'', which in 1994 was adapted as a film of [[Tom &amp; Viv|the same name]].

In a private paper written in his sixties, Eliot confessed: "I came to persuade myself that I was in love with Vivienne simply because I wanted to burn my boats and commit myself to staying in England. And she persuaded herself (also under the influence of [Ezra] Pound) that she would save the poet by keeping him in England. To her, the marriage brought no happiness. To me, it brought the state of mind out of which came ''The Waste Land''."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, T. S. ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot, Volume 1, 1898–1922.'' London: Faber and Faber. 1988. p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching, Lloyds, Faber and Faber===
[[File:TSEliotFaberHouse (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.55|A plaque at [[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]]'s Faber Building, 24 [[Russell Square]], London]]
After leaving Merton, Eliot worked as a schoolteacher, most notably at [[Highgate School]], a private school in London, where he taught French and Latin—his students included the young [[John Betjeman]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Later he taught at the [[Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe]], a state school in [[Buckinghamshire]]. To earn extra money, he wrote book reviews and lectured at evening extension courses at the University College London, and Oxford. In 1917, he took a position at [[Lloyds Bank (historic)|Lloyds Bank]] in London, working on foreign accounts. On a trip to Paris in August 1920 with the artist [[Wyndham Lewis]], he met the writer [[James Joyce]]. Eliot said he found Joyce arrogant—Joyce doubted Eliot's ability as a poet at the time—but the two soon became friends, with Eliot visiting Joyce whenever he was in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Ellmann|Ellmann, Richard]]. ''James Joyce''. pp. 492–495.&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot and Wyndham Lewis also maintained a close friendship, leading to Lewis's later making his well-known portrait painting of Eliot in 1938.

[[Charles Whibley]] recommended T.S. Eliot to [[Geoffrey Faber]].&lt;ref name="RK"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Kojecky|first1=Roger|authorlink1= |title= T. S.

===Conversion to Anglicanism and British citizenship===
[[File:T.S. Eliot house.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Faber and Faber]] building where Eliot worked from 1925 to 1965; the commemorative plaque is under the right-hand arch.]]
On 29 June 1927, Eliot converted to [[Anglicanism]] from [[Unitarianism]], and in November that year he took [[British nationality law|British citizenship]]. He became a [[churchwarden|warden]] of his parish church, [[St Stephen's, Gloucester Road]], London, and a life member of the [[Society of King Charles the Martyr]].&lt;ref&gt;plaque on interior wall of Saint Stephen's&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;obituary notice in ''Church and King'', Vol. XVII, No. 4, 28 February 1965,−− p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He specifically identified as [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]], proclaiming himself "classicist in literature, royalist in politics, and anglo-catholic {{sic}} in religion".&lt;ref&gt;Specific quote is "The general point of view [of the essays] may be described as classicist in literature, royalist in politics, and anglo-catholic {{sic}} in religion", in preface by T. S. Eliot to ''For [[Lancelot Andrewes]]: Essays on style and order'' (1929).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,756146,00.html Books: Royalist, Classicist, Anglo-Catholic], 25 May 1936, ''Time''.&lt;/ref&gt; About 30 years later Eliot commented on his religious views that he combined "a Catholic cast of mind, a Calvinist heritage, and a Puritanical temperament".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eliot|first=T. S.|title=On Poetry and Poets|year=1986|publisher=Faber &amp;amp; Faber|location=London|isbn=0571089836|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had wider spiritual interests, commenting that "I see the path of progress for modern man in his occupation with his own self, with his inner being" and citing  [[Goethe]] and [[Rudolf Steiner]] as exemplars of such a direction.&lt;ref&gt;Radio interview on 26 September 1959, ''Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk'', as cited in {{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Colin|title=Beyond the Occult|publisher=Bantam Press|location=London|year=1988|pages=335–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Eliot's biographers, [[Peter Ackroyd]], commented that "the purposes of [Eliot's conversion] were two-fold. One: the Church of England offered Eliot some hope for himself, and I think Eliot needed some resting place. But secondly, it attached Eliot to the English community and English culture."&lt;ref name="learner.org"/&gt;

===Separation and remarriage===
By 1932, Eliot had been contemplating a separation from his wife for some time. When Harvard offered him the [[Charles Eliot Norton professorship]] for the 1932–1933 academic year, he accepted and left Vivienne in England. Upon his return, he arranged for a formal separation from her, avoiding all but one meeting with her between his leaving for America in 1932 and her death in 1947. Vivienne was committed to the Northumberland House mental hospital, [[Stoke Newington]], in 1938, and remained there until she died. Although Eliot was still legally her husband, he never visited her.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour-Jones, Carole. ''Painted Shadow: A Life of Vivienne Eliot''. Constable 2001, p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1938 to 1957 Eliot's public companion was [[Mary Trevelyan]] of London University, who wanted to marry him and left a detailed memoir.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, Ronald, ''T. S. Eliot: The Modernist in History'' 1991, p. 11: "Mary Trevelyan, then aged forty, was less important for Eliot's writing. Where Emily Hale and Vivienne were part of Eliot's private phantasmagoria, Mary Trevelyan played her part in what was essentially a public friendship. She was Eliot's escort for nearly twenty years until his second marriage in 1957. A brainy woman, with the bracing organizational energy of a Florence Nightingale, she propped the outer structure of Eliot's life, but for him she, too, represented .."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Surette, Leon, ''The Modern Dilemma: Wallace Stevens, T.S. Eliot, and Humanism'', 2008, p. 343: "Later, sensible, efficient Mary Trevelyan served her long stint as support during the years of penitence. For her their friendship was a commitment; for Eliot quite peripheral. His passion for immortality was so commanding that it allowed him to ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haldar, Santwana, ''T. S. Eliot – A Twenty-first Century View'' 2005, p. xv: "Details of Eliot's friendship with Emily Hale, who was very close to him in his Boston days and with Mary Trevelyan, who wanted to marry him and left a riveting memoir of Eliot's most inscrutable years of fame, shed new light on this period in...."&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1946 to 1957, Eliot shared a flat at 19 [[Carlyle Mansions]], Chelsea, with his friend [[John Davy Hayward]], who collected and managed Eliot's papers, styling himself "Keeper of the Eliot Archive".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/books-obituaries/9670663/Valerie-Eliot.html Retrieved 1 July 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyndall Gordon|Gordon, Lyndall]]. ''T. S. Eliot: An Imperfect Life''. Norton 1998, p. 455.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayward also collected Eliot's pre-Prufrock verse, commercially published after Eliot's death as ''Poems Written in Early Youth''. When Eliot and Hayward separated their household in 1957, Hayward retained his collection of Eliot's papers, which he bequeathed to [[King's College, Cambridge]], in 1965.

On 10 January 1957, at the age of 68, Eliot married [[Esmé Valerie Fletcher]], who was 30. In contrast to his first marriage, Eliot knew Fletcher well, as she had been his secretary at [[Faber and Faber]] since August 1949. They kept their wedding secret; the ceremony was held in a church at 6:15 am with virtually no one in attendance other than his wife's parents. Eliot had no children with either of his wives. In the early 1960s, by then in failing health, Eliot worked as an editor for the [[Wesleyan University Press]], seeking new poets in Europe for publication. After Eliot's death, Valerie dedicated her time to preserving his legacy, by editing and annotating ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'' and a facsimile of the draft of ''The Waste Land''.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Jane.

In 1967, on the second anniversary of his death, Eliot was commemorated by the placement of a large stone in the floor of [[Poets' Corner]] in London's [[Westminster Abbey]]. The stone, cut by designer [[Reynolds Stone]], is inscribed with his life dates, his [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]], and a quotation from his poem "[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]", "the communication / of the dead is tongued with fire beyond / the language of the living."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/people/thomas-stearns-eliot|title=Thomas Stearns Eliot|publisher=westminster-abbey.org|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==
For a poet of his stature, Eliot produced a relatively small number of poems. He was aware of this even early in his career. He wrote to J.H. Woods, one of his former Harvard professors, "My reputation in London is built upon one small volume of verse, and is kept up by printing two or three more poems in a year. The only thing that matters is that these should be perfect in their kind, so that each should be an event."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, T. S. "Letter to J. H. Woods, April 21, 1919." ''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', vol. I. Valerie Eliot (ed.), New York: Harcourt Brace, 1988, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, Eliot first published his poems individually in periodicals or in small books or pamphlets, and then collected them in books. His first collection was ''Prufrock and Other Observations'' (1917). In 1920, he published more poems in ''Ara Vos Prec'' (London) and ''Poems: 1920'' (New York). These had the same poems (in a different order) except that "Ode" in the British edition was replaced with "Hysteria" in the American edition. In 1925, he collected ''The Waste Land'' and the poems in ''Prufrock'' and ''Poems'' into one volume and added ''The Hollow Men'' to form ''Poems: 1909–1925''. From then on, he updated this work as ''Collected Poems''. Exceptions are ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' (1939), a collection of light verse; ''Poems Written in Early Youth'', posthumously published in 1967 and consisting mainly of poems published between 1907 and 1910 in ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', and ''Inventions of the March Hare: Poems 1909–1917'', material Eliot never intended to have published, which appeared posthumously in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworld.com/~raparker/exploring/tseliot/works/poems/eliot-harvard-poems.html |title='&amp;#39;T.

During an interview in 1959, Eliot said of his nationality and its role in his work: "I'd say that my poetry has obviously more in common with my distinguished contemporaries in America than with anything written in my generation in England. That I'm sure of. ... It wouldn't be what it is, and I imagine it wouldn't be so good; putting it as modestly as I can, it wouldn't be what it is if I'd been born in England, and it wouldn't be what it is if I'd stayed in America. It's a combination of things. But in its sources, in its emotional springs, it comes from America."&lt;ref name=Hall25&gt;{{cite web

Cleo McNelly Kearns notes in her biography that Eliot was deeply influenced by Indic traditions, notably the [[Upanishads]]. From the Sanskrit ending of ''The Waste Land'' to the "What Krishna meant" section of ''Four Quartets'' shows how much Indic religions and more specifically Hinduism made up his philosophical basic for his thought process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/5912809/T._S._Eliot_and_Indic_Traditions_A_Study_in_Poetry_and_Belief|title=T. S. Eliot and Indic Traditions: A Study in Poetry and Belief|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It must also be acknowledged, as [[Chinmoy Guha]] showed in his book ''Where the Dreams Cross: T S Eliot and French Poetry'' (Macmillan, 2011), that he was deeply influenced by French poets from Baudelaire to Paul Valéry. He himself wrote in his 1940 essay on W.B. Yeats: "The kind of poetry that I needed to teach me the use of my own voice did not exist in English at all; it was only to be found in French." ("Yeats," ''On Poetry and Poets'', 1948)

===''The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock''===
{{Main|The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock}}

In 1915, [[Ezra Pound]], overseas editor of [[Poetry (magazine)|''Poetry'']] magazine, recommended to [[Harriet Monroe]], the magazine's founder, that she publish "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock".&lt;ref&gt;Mertens, Richard. [http://magazine.uchicago.edu/0108/features/letter.html "Letter By Letter"] in ''The University of Chicago Magazine'' (August 2001). Retrieved 23 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the character Prufrock seems to be middle-aged, Eliot wrote most of the poem when he was only twenty-two. Its now-famous opening lines, comparing the evening sky to "a patient etherised upon a table", were considered shocking and offensive, especially at a time when [[Georgian Poetry]] was hailed for its derivations of the nineteenth century [[romanticism|Romantic Poets]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The poem follows the conscious experience of a man, Prufrock (relayed in the "[[Stream of consciousness writing|stream of consciousness]]" form characteristic of the [[Modernists]]), lamenting his physical and intellectual inertia with the recurrent theme of carnal love unattained. Critical opinion is divided as to whether the narrator leaves his residence during the course of the narration. The locations described can be interpreted either as actual physical experiences, mental recollections, or as symbolic images from the unconscious mind, as, for example, in the refrain "In the room the women come and go".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The poem's structure was heavily influenced by Eliot's extensive reading of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and refers to a number of literary works, including ''[[Hamlet]]'' and those of the French Symbolists. Its reception in London can be gauged from an unsigned review in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' on 21 June 1917. "The fact that these things occurred to the mind of Mr. Eliot is surely of the very smallest importance to anyone, even to himself. They certainly have no relation to ''poetry''."&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, Arthur. [https://www.usask.ca/english/prufrock/recept1.htm "The New Poetry"], ''Quarterly Review'', October 1916, p. 226, citing the ''Times Literary Supplement'' 21 June 1917, no. 805, 299; Wagner, Erica (2001) [https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4250053,00.html "An eruption of fury"], ''The Guardian'', letters to the editor, 4 September 2001. Wagner omits the word "very" from the quote.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Waste Land''===
[[File:T.S. Eliot, 1923.JPG|thumb|right|T. S. Eliot in 1923, by [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]]]]
{{Main|The Waste Land}}
In October 1922, Eliot published ''The Waste Land'' in ''[[The Criterion]]''. Eliot's dedication to ''il miglior fabbro'' ("the better craftsman") refers to Ezra Pound's significant hand in editing and reshaping the poem from a longer Eliot manuscript to the shortened version that appears in publication.&lt;ref name="MillerJames E. Hughes Jr2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=James H., Jr.|title=T. S. Eliot: the making of an American poet, 1888–1922|year=2005|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, PA|isbn=0-271-02681-2|pages=387–388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was composed during a period of personal difficulty for Eliot—his marriage was failing, and both he and Vivienne were suffering from nervous disorders. The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to [[Richard Aldington]], saying, "As for ''The Waste Land'', that is a thing of the past so far as I am concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style."&lt;ref&gt;''The Letters of T. S. Eliot'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;596&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem is known for its obscure nature—its slippage between satire and prophecy; its abrupt changes of speaker, location, and time. This structural complexity is one of the reasons why the poem has become a touchstone of [[Modernist poetry in English|modern literature]], a poetic counterpart to a novel published in the same year, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.&lt;ref&gt;MacCabe, Colin. ''T. S. Eliot''. Tavistock: Northcote House, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among its best-known phrases are "April is the cruellest month", "I will show you fear in a handful of dust" and ''"[[Shanti Mantra|Shantih shantih shantih]]"''. The Sanskrit ''[[mantra]]'' ends the poem.

===''The Hollow Men''===
{{Main|The Hollow Men|The Hollow Men in popular culture}}
''The Hollow Men'' appeared in 1925. For the critic [[Edmund Wilson]], it marked "The nadir of the phase of despair and desolation given such effective expression in ''The Waste Land''."&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Wilson|Wilson, Edmund]]. "Review of Ash Wednesday", ''New Republic'', 20 August 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; It is Eliot's major poem of the late 1920s. Similar to Eliot's other works, its themes are overlapping and fragmentary. Post-war Europe under the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (which Eliot despised), the difficulty of hope and religious conversion, Eliot's failed marriage.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, the biographically oriented work of one of Eliot's editors and major critics, Ronald Schuchard.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allen Tate]] perceived a shift in Eliot's method, writing, "The mythologies disappear altogether in ''The Hollow Men''." This is a striking claim for a poem as indebted to [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] as anything else in Eliot's early work, to say little of the modern English mythology—the "Old [[Guy Fawkes]]" of the [[Gunpowder Plot]]—or the colonial and [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] mythos of [[Joseph Conrad]] and [[James George Frazer]], which, at least for reasons of textual history, echo in ''The Waste Land''.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Michael (ed.).

Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; The "continuous parallel between contemporaneity and antiquity" that is so characteristic of his mythical method remained in fine form.&lt;ref&gt;" 'Ulysses', Order, and Myth", ''Selected Essays'' T. S. Eliot (orig 1923).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Hollow Men'' contains some of Eliot's most famous lines, notably its conclusion: &lt;blockquote&gt;''This is the way the world ends''&lt;br/&gt;''Not with a bang but a whimper.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Ash-Wednesday''===
{{Main|Ash Wednesday (poem)}}
''Ash-Wednesday'' is the first long poem written by Eliot after his 1927 conversion to [[Church of England|Anglicanism]]. Published in 1930, it deals with the struggle that ensues when one who has lacked faith acquires it. Sometimes referred to as Eliot's "conversion poem", it is richly but ambiguously allusive, and deals with the aspiration to move from spiritual barrenness to hope for human [[salvation]]. Eliot's style of writing in ''Ash-Wednesday'' showed a marked shift from the poetry he had written prior to his 1927 conversion, and his post-conversion style continued in a similar vein. His style became less ironic, and the poems were no longer populated by multiple characters in dialogue. His subject matter also became more focused on Eliot's spiritual concerns and his Christian faith.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Many critics were particularly enthusiastic about ''Ash-Wednesday''. [[Edwin Muir]] maintained that it is one of the most moving poems Eliot wrote, and perhaps the "most perfect", though it was not well received by everyone. The poem's groundwork of orthodox Christianity discomfited many of the more secular ''[[Intellectual|literati]]''.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref name=Untermeyer&gt;[[Louis Untermeyer|Untermeyer, Louis]].

===''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats''===
{{Main|Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats}}
In 1939, Eliot published a book of [[light verse]], ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' ("Old Possum" was Ezra Pound's nickname for him). This first edition had an illustration of the author on the cover. In 1954, the composer [[Alan Rawsthorne]] set six of the poems for speaker and orchestra in a work titled ''Practical Cats''. After Eliot's death, the book was adapted as the basis of the musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' by [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], first produced in London's West End in 1981 and opening on [[broadway theatre|Broadway]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/an-introduction-to-old-possums-book-of-practical-cats|title=An introduction to Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats|website=The British Library|language=en|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Four Quartets''===
{{Main|Four Quartets}}
Eliot regarded ''Four Quartets'' as his masterpiece, and it is the work that led to his being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; It consists of four long poems, each first published separately: ''[[Burnt Norton]]'' (1936), ''[[East Coker (poem)|East Coker]]'' (1940), ''[[Four Quartets#The Dry Salvages|The Dry Salvages]]'' (1941) and ''[[Little Gidding (poem)|Little Gidding]]'' (1942). Each has five sections. Although they resist easy characterisation, each poem includes meditations on the nature of time in some important respect—[[theological]], historical, physical—and its relation to the human condition. Each poem is associated with one of the four [[classical elements]], respectively: air, earth, water, and fire.

''Burnt Norton'' is a meditative poem that begins with the narrator trying to focus on the present moment while walking through a garden, focusing on images and sounds like the bird, the roses, clouds, and an empty pool. The narrator's meditation leads him/her to reach "the still point" in which he doesn't try to get anywhere or to experience place and/or time, instead experiencing "a grace of sense". In the final section, the narrator contemplates the arts ("Words" and "music") as they relate to time. The narrator focuses particularly on the poet's art of manipulating "Words [which] strain, / Crack and sometimes break, under the burden [of time], under the tension, slip, slide, perish, decay with imprecision, [and] will not stay in place, / Will not stay still." By comparison, the narrator concludes that "Love is itself unmoving, / Only the cause and end of movement, / Timeless, and undesiring."

''East Coker'' continues the examination of time and meaning, focusing in a famous passage on the nature of language and poetry. Out of darkness, Eliot offers a solution: "I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope."

''The Dry Salvages'' treats the element of water, via images of river and sea. It strives to contain opposites: "The past and future / Are conquered, and reconciled."

''Little Gidding'' (the element of fire) is the most anthologised of the Quartets. Eliot's experiences as an air raid warden in [[the Blitz]] power the poem, and he imagines meeting [[Dante]] during the German bombing. The beginning of the Quartets ("Houses / Are removed, destroyed") had become a violent everyday experience; this creates an animation, where for the first time he talks of Love as the driving force behind all experience. From this background, the Quartets end with an affirmation of [[Julian of Norwich]]: "All shall be well and / All manner of thing&lt;!-- NOT "things" - Collected Poems, p.209 --&gt; shall be well."

The ''Four Quartets'' cannot be understood without reference to Christian thought, traditions, and history. Eliot draws upon the theology, art, symbolism and language of such figures as Dante, and mystics [[St. John of the Cross]] and [[Julian of Norwich]]. The "deeper communion" sought in ''East Coker'', the "hints and whispers of children, the sickness that must grow worse in order to find healing", and the exploration which inevitably leads us home all point to the pilgrim's path along the road of [[sanctification]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Plays==
{{Main|Sweeney Agonistes|Murder in the Cathedral|The Rock (play)|The Family Reunion|The Cocktail Party|The Confidential Clerk|The Elder Statesman}}
With the important exception of ''Four Quartets'', Eliot directed much of his creative energies after ''Ash Wednesday'' to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of [[Elizabethan]] and [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] verse drama; witness his allusions to [[John Webster|Webster]], [[Thomas Middleton]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Thomas Kyd]] in ''The Waste Land''. In a 1933 lecture he said "Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer, and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience, but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it."&lt;ref name="upuc"&gt;Eliot, T. S. ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism'', Harvard University Press, 1933 (penultimate paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''The Waste Land'' (1922), he wrote that he was "now feeling toward a new form and style". One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early [[jazz]]. The play featured "Sweeney", a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes, titled ''Fragment of a Prologue'' (1926) and ''Fragment of an Agon'' (1927), were published together in 1932 as ''[[Sweeney Agonistes]]''. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one.&lt;ref name=Gallup/&gt;

A pageant play by Eliot called ''The Rock'' was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the [[Diocese of London]]. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses.&lt;ref name=Gallup/&gt; [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], the [[Bishop of Chichester]], had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer [[E. Martin Browne]] for the production of ''The Rock'', and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the [[Canterbury Festival]] in 1935. This one, ''Murder in the Cathedral'', concerning the death of the martyr, [[Thomas Becket]], was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer [[Peter Ackroyd]] comments that "for [Eliot], ''Murder in the Cathedral'' and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility."&lt;ref name="learner.org"/&gt; After this, he worked on more "commercial" plays for more general audiences: ''The Family Reunion'' (1939), ''The Cocktail Party'' (1949), ''The Confidential Clerk'', (1953) and ''The Elder Statesman'' (1958) (the latter three were produced by [[Henry Sherek]] and directed by [[E. Martin Browne]]&lt;ref name="Darlington"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36063|title=Henry Sherek|last=Darlington|first=W. A.|year=2004|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=27 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The Broadway production in New York of ''The Cocktail Party'' received the 1950 [[Tony Award]] for Best Play. Eliot wrote ''The Cocktail Party'' while he was a visiting scholar at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ias.edu/files/pdfs/publications/letter-2007-spring.pdf T. S. Eliot at the Institute for Advanced Study], ''The Institute Letter'', Spring 2007, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 Eliot, Thomas Stearns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119203650/https://www.ias.edu/people/cos/users/teliot01 |date=19 January 2015 }} IAS profile&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding his method of playwriting, Eliot explained, "If I set out to write a play, I start by an act of choice. I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind."&lt;ref name="learner.org"/&gt;

==Literary criticism==
Eliot also made significant contributions to the field of [[literary criticism]], strongly influencing the school of [[New Criticism]]. He was somewhat self-deprecating and minimising of his work and once said his criticism was merely a "by-product" of his "private poetry-workshop" But the critic [[William Empson]] once said, "I do not know for certain how much of my own mind [Eliot] invented, let alone how much of it is a reaction against him or indeed a consequence of misreading him. He is a very penetrating influence, perhaps not unlike the east wind."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Roger Kimball, "A Craving for Reality", ''The New Criterion'' Vol. 18, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In his critical essay "[[Tradition and the Individual Talent]]", Eliot argues that art must be understood not in a vacuum, but in the context of previous pieces of art. "In a peculiar sense [an artist or poet] ... must inevitably be judged by the standards of the past."&lt;ref name=bartleby1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw4.html |title=Tradition and the Individual Talent|author= Eliot, T. S. |work=The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |date=1930 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This essay was an important influence over the New Criticism by introducing the idea that the value of a work of art must be viewed in the context of the artist's previous works, a "simultaneous order" of works (i.e., "tradition"). Eliot himself employed this concept on many of his works, especially on his long-poem ''The Waste Land''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leidykla.vu.lt/fileadmin/Literatura/51_3/98-108.pdf Dirk Weidmann: ''And I Tiresias have foresuffered all...'']. In: ''LITERATURA'' 51 (3), 2009, pp.98–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important to New Criticism was the idea—as articulated in Eliot's essay "[[Hamlet and His Problems]]"—of an "[[objective correlative]]", which posits a connection among the words of the text and events, states of mind, and experiences.&lt;ref name=Hamlet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw9.html |title=Hamlet and His Problems|author= Eliot, T. S. |work= The Sacred Wood |publisher=Bartleby.com |date=1921 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion concedes that a poem means what it says, but suggests that there can be a non-subjective judgment based on different readers' different—but perhaps corollary—interpretations of a work.

More generally, New Critics took a cue from Eliot in regard to his "'classical' ideals and his religious thought; his attention to the poetry and drama of the early seventeenth century; his deprecation of the Romantics, especially Shelley; his proposition that good poems constitute 'not a turning loose of emotion but an escape from emotion'; and his insistence that 'poets... at present must be difficult'."&lt;ref&gt;Burt, Steven and Lewin, Jennifer. "Poetry and the New Criticism". ''A Companion to Twentieth-Century Poetry'', Neil Roberts, ed. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishers, 2001. p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliot's essays were a major factor in the revival of interest in the [[metaphysical poets]]. Eliot particularly praised the metaphysical poets' ability to show experience as both psychological and sensual, while at the same time infusing this portrayal with—in Eliot's view—wit and uniqueness. Eliot's essay "The Metaphysical Poets", along with giving new significance and attention to metaphysical poetry, introduced his now well-known definition of "unified sensibility", which is considered by some to mean the same thing as the term "metaphysical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_modern_literature/v027/27.1baker.html |title=Project MUSE |publisher=Muse.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. E. Malloch, "The Unified Sensibility and Metaphysical Poetry", ''College English'', Vol. 15, No. 2 (Nov. 1953), pp. 95–101&lt;/ref&gt;

His 1922 poem ''The Waste Land''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html |author=Eliot, T. S. |title=The Waste Land|publisher=Bartleby.com |date= 1922|accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; also can be better understood in light of his work as a critic. He had argued that a poet must write "programmatic criticism", that is, a poet should write to advance his own interests rather than to advance "historical scholarship". Viewed from Eliot's critical lens, ''The Waste Land'' likely shows his personal despair about [[World War I]] rather than an objective historical understanding of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-2088/TS-Eliot |title=T. S. Eliot :: The Waste Land And Criticism |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=4 January 1965 |accessdate=3 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in his career, Eliot focused much of his creative energy on writing for the theatre; some of his earlier critical writing, in essays such as "Poetry and Drama,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/poetryanddrama029231mbp|title=Poetry And Drama|first=T. S.|last=Eliot|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Faber And Faber Limited.|accessdate=26 January 2017|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Hamlet and his Problems,"&lt;ref name=Hamlet /&gt; and "The Possibility of a Poetic Drama,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/200/sw5.html|title=The Possibility of a Poetic Drama|author= Eliot, T.

==Critical reception==

===Responses to his poetry===
The writer Ronald Bush notes that Eliot's early poems like "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock", "Portrait of a Lady", "La Figlia Che Piange", "Preludes", and "Rhapsody on a Windy Night" had "[an] effect [that] was both unique and compelling, and their assurance staggered [Eliot's] contemporaries who were privileged to read them in manuscript. [Conrad] Aiken, for example, marveled at 'how sharp and complete and [[sui generis]] the whole thing was, from the outset. The wholeness is there, from the very beginning.'"&lt;ref name="english.illinois.edu"&gt;Bush, Ronald. "T. S. Eliot's Life and Career", in John A Garraty and Mark C. Carnes (eds), ''American National Biography''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, via [http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/a_f/eliot/life.htm Modern American Poetry.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial critical response to Eliot's "The Waste Land" was mixed. Bush notes that the piece was at first correctly perceived as a work of jazz-like syncopation—and, like 1920s [[jazz]], essentially iconoclastic."&lt;ref name="english.illinois.edu"/&gt; Some critics, like [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Conrad Aiken]], and [[Gilbert Seldes]] thought it was the best poetry being written in the English language while others thought it was esoteric and wilfully difficult. Edmund Wilson, being one of the critics who praised Eliot, called him "one of our only authentic poets".&lt;ref name="Wilson, Edmund 1922"&gt;Wilson, Edmund, "The Poetry of Drouth". ''The Dial'' 73. December 1922. 611-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson also pointed out some of Eliot's weaknesses as a poet. In regard to "The Waste Land", Wilson admits its flaws ("its lack of structural unity"), but concluded, "I doubt whether there is a single other poem of equal length by a contemporary American which displays so high and so varied a mastery of English verse."&lt;ref name="Wilson, Edmund 1922"/&gt;

Charles Powell was negative in his criticism of Eliot, calling his poems incomprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, Charles. "So Much Waste Paper". Manchester Guardian. 31 October 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; And the writers of ''Time'' magazine were similarly baffled by a challenging poem like "The Waste Land".&lt;ref&gt;Time. 3 March 1923, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Crowe Ransom]] wrote negative criticisms of Eliot's work but also had positive things to say. For instance, though Ransom negatively criticised "The Waste Land" for its "extreme disconnection", Ransom was not completely condemnatory of Eliot's work and admitted that Eliot was a talented poet.&lt;ref&gt;Ransom, John Crowe. "Waste Lands". New York Evening Post Literary Review. 14 July 1923. 825-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing some of the common criticisms directed against "The Waste Land" at the time, Gilbert Seldes stated, "It seems at first sight remarkably disconnected and confused... [however] a closer view of the poem does more than illuminate the difficulties; it reveals the hidden form of the work, [and] indicates how each thing falls into place."&lt;ref&gt;Seldes, Gilbert. "T. S. Eliot". Nation. 6 December 1922. 614–616.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eliot's reputation as a poet, as well as his influence in the academy, peaked following the publication of ''The Four Quartets''. In an essay on Eliot published in 1989, the writer [[Cynthia Ozick]] refers to this peak of influence (from the 1940s through the early 1960s) as "the Age of Eliot" when Eliot "seemed pure zenith, a colossus, nothing less than a permanent luminary, fixed in the firmament like the sun and the moon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1989/11/20/t-s-eliot-at-101|title=T.S. ELIOT AT 101|publisher=newyorker.com|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But during this post-war period, others, like Ronald Bush, observed that this time also marked the beginning of the decline in Eliot's literary influence: &lt;blockquote&gt;As Eliot's conservative religious and political convictions began to seem less congenial in the postwar world, other readers reacted with suspicion to his assertions of authority, obvious in ''Four Quartets'' and implicit in the earlier poetry. The result, fueled by intermittent rediscovery of Eliot's occasional anti-Semitic rhetoric, has been a progressive downward revision of his once towering reputation.&lt;ref name="english.illinois.edu"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Bush also notes that Eliot's reputation "slipped" significantly further after his death. He writes, "Sometimes regarded as too academic ([[William Carlos Williams]]'s view), Eliot was also frequently criticized for a deadening [[neoclassicism]] (as he himself—perhaps just as unfairly—had criticized [[John Milton|Milton]]). However, the multifarious tributes from practicing poets of many schools published during his centenary in 1988 was a strong indication of the intimidating continued presence of his poetic voice."&lt;ref name="english.illinois.edu"/&gt;

Although Eliot's poetry is not as influential as it once was, notable literary scholars, like [[Harold Bloom]]&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold. ''The Western Canon: Books and Schools of the Ages''. NY: Riverhead, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Greenblatt]],&lt;ref&gt;Eds. Stephen Greenblatt, et al. ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume 2''. "T.S. Eliot". W.W. Norton &amp; Co.: NY, NY, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; still acknowledge that Eliot's poetry is central to the literary English canon. For instance, the editors of ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'' write, "There is no disagreement on [Eliot's] importance as one of the great renovators of the English poetry dialect, whose influence on a whole generation of poets, critics, and intellectuals generally was enormous. [However] his range as a poet [was] limited, and his interest in the great middle ground of human experience (as distinct from the extremes of saint and sinner) [was] deficient." Despite this criticism, these scholars also acknowledge "[Eliot's] poetic cunning, his fine craftsmanship, his original accent, his historical and representative importance as ''the'' poet of the modern [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]-[[Metaphysical poets|Metaphysical]] tradition".&lt;ref&gt;The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Volume 2. "T.S. Eliot". W.W. Norton &amp; Co.: NY, NY, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of anti-Semitism===
The depiction of [[Jew]]s in some of Eliot's poems has led several critics to accuse him of [[anti-Semitism]]. This case has been presented most forcefully in a study by [[Anthony Julius]]: ''T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form'' (1996).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gross|Gross, John]]. [https://archive.is/20120731045824/http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/was-t-s--eliot-a-scoundrel--8635 ''Was T.S. Eliot a Scoundrel?''], ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary magazine]]'', November 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Julius|Anthony, Julius]]. ''T.S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form''. Cambridge University Press, 1996 {{ISBN|0-521-58673-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Gerontion]]", Eliot writes, in the voice of the poem's elderly narrator, "And the jew squats on the window sill, the owner [of my building] / Spawned in some [[wikt:estaminet|estaminet]] of Antwerp."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, T. S. "Gerontion". ''Collected Poems''. Harcourt, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known example appears in the poem, "Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar". In this poem, Eliot wrote, "The rats are underneath the piles. / The jew is underneath the lot. / Money in furs."&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, T. S. "Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar". ''Collected Poems''. Harcourt, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Interpreting the line as an indirect comparison of Jews to rats, Julius writes, "The anti-Semitism is unmistakable. It reaches out like a clear signal to the reader." Julius's viewpoint has been supported by literary critics such as [[Harold Bloom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In a series of lectures delivered at the [[University of Virginia]] in 1933, published under the title ''After Strange Gods: A Primer of Modern Heresy'' (1934), Eliot wrote of societal tradition and coherence, "What is still more important [than cultural homogeneity] is unity of religious background, and reasons of race and religion combine to make any large number of free-thinking Jews undesirable."&lt;ref&gt;[[Russell Kirk|Kirk, Russell]]. [http://www.touchstonemag.com/archives/article.php?id=04-03-023-v "T. S. Eliot on Literary Morals: On T. S. Eliot's ''After Strange Gods''"], ''[[Touchstone Magazine]]'', volume 10, issue 4, Fall 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot never re-published this book/lecture.&lt;ref name = "Dean"/&gt; In his 1934 pageant play ''The Rock'', Eliot distances himself from Fascist movements of the Thirties by caricaturing Oswald Mosley's Blackshirts, who 'firmly refuse/ To descend to palaver with anthropoid Jews'.&lt;ref&gt;T.S. Eliot, ''The Rock'' (London: Faber and Faber, 1934), 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'new evangels'&lt;ref&gt;''The Rock'', 44&lt;/ref&gt; of totalitarianism are presented as antithetic to the spirit of Christianity.

[[Craig Raine]], in his books ''In Defence of T. S. Eliot'' (2001) and ''T. S. Eliot'' (2006), sought to defend Eliot from the charge of anti-Semitism. Reviewing the 2006 book, Paul Dean stated that he was not convinced by Raine's argument. Nevertheless, he concluded, "Ultimately, as both Raine and, to do him justice, Julius insist, however much Eliot may have been compromised as a person, as we all are in our several ways, his greatness as a poet remains."&lt;ref name = "Dean"/&gt; In another review of Raine's 2006 book, the literary critic [[Terry Eagleton]] also questioned the validity of Raine's defence of Eliot's character flaws as well as the entire basis for Raine's book, writing, "Why do critics feel a need to defend the authors they write on, like doting parents deaf to all criticism of their obnoxious children? Eliot's well-earned reputation [as a poet] is established beyond all doubt, and making him out to be as unflawed as the [[Gabriel|Archangel Gabriel]] does him no favours."&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry.

{{essay|date=November 2010}}

A '''truth-bearer''' is an [[entity]] that is said to be either true or false and nothing else. The thesis that some things are true while others are false has led to different theories about the nature of these entities.  Since there is divergence of opinion on the matter, the term ''truth-bearer'' is used to be neutral among the various [[philosophical theory|theories]].  Truth-bearer candidates include [[proposition]]s, [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, [[Type–token distinction|sentence-tokens]], [[statement (logic)|statements]], [[concept]]s, [[belief]]s, [[thought]]s, [[intuition (philosophy)|intuition]]s, [[utterance]]s, and [[judgement]]s but different authors exclude one or more of these, deny their existence, argue that they are true only in a derivative sense, assert or assume that the terms are synonymous,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. 
* "In [[mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], a statement (also called a proposition) is a complete declarative sentence, which is either true or false." [http://www.jcu.edu/math/Vignettes/logic.htm Vignette 17 Logic, Truth and Language]
* "A statement is just that; it is a declaration about something—anything—a declaration which can be evaluated as either true or false.  "I am reading this sentence" is a statement, and if indeed you have looked at it and comprehended its meaning, then it is safe to say that that statement can be evaluated as true."[http://home.att.net/~tangents/issue/think/concepts.htm Fundamental Logic Concepts: Statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522140629/http://home.att.net/~tangents/issue/think/concepts.htm |date=2008-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
or seek to avoid addressing their distinction or do not clarify it.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. * "Some philosophers claim that declarative sentences of natural language have underlying [[logical form]]s and that these forms are displayed by [[well-formed formula|formulas]] of a [[formal language]]. Other writers hold that (successful) declarative sentences express propositions; and formulas of formal languages somehow display the forms of these propositions." {{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Stewart|title="Classical Logic" in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  |editor=Edward N.

==Introduction==
Some distinctions and terminology as used in this article, based on Wolfram 1989&lt;ref name="Wolfram 1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram |first=Sybil|publisher=Routledge, London and New York|title=Philosophical Logic|year=1989|isbn=0-415-02317-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(Chapter 2 Section1) follow. 
''It should be understood that the terminology described is not always used in the ways set out, and it is introduced solely for the purposes of discussion in this article.''    Use is made of the [[type–token distinction|type–token]] and [[Use–mention distinction|use–mention]] distinctions. Reflection on [[occurrences of numerals]] might be helpful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Occurrences of numerals]]&lt;/ref&gt;
In grammar a sentence can be a declaration, an [[explanation]], a question, a command. In logic a declarative sentence is considered to be a sentence that can be used to communicate truth. Some sentences which are grammatically declarative are not logically so.

A '''character'''&lt;ref name=character group="nb"&gt;
'''Character''' A ''character'' is a typographic character (printed or written), a unit of speech, a phoneme, a series of dots and dashes (as sounds, magnetic pulses, printed or written), a flag or stick held at a certain angle, a gesture, a sign as use in sign language, a pattern or raised indentations (as in brail) etc. in other words the sort of things that are commonly described as the elements of an alphabet.&lt;/ref&gt; is a typographic character (printed or written) etc.

A '''word-token'''&lt;ref name=wordtoken group="nb"&gt;
'''Word-token'''
A word-token is a pattern of characters.&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters A ''This toucan can catch a can'' contains six word-tokens&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters D ''He is grnd''  contains three word-tokens&lt;/ref&gt; is a pattern of characters.
A '''word-type'''&lt;ref name=word-type group="nb"&gt;'''Word-type''' A word-type is an identical pattern of characters, .&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters A: ''This toucan can catch a can.'' contains five word-types (the word-token can occurring twice)
&lt;/ref&gt;
is an identical pattern of characters.
A '''meaningful-word-token'''&lt;ref name=meaningful-word-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Meaningful-word-token''' A meaningful-word-token is a meaningful word-token.  ''grnd'' in D ''He is grnd.''  is not meaningful..&lt;/ref&gt;
is a meaningful word-token.
Two word-tokens which mean the same are of the same '''word-meaning'''&lt;ref name=word-meaning group="nb"&gt;
'''Word-meaning''' Two word-tokens which mean the same are of the same word-meaning.  Only those word-tokens which are meaningful-word-tokens can have the same meaning as another word-token.
The pattern of characters A: ''This toucan can catch a can.''  contains six word-meanings.&lt;br /&gt;
Although it contains only five word-types, the two occurrences of the word-token ''can'' have different meanings.&lt;br /&gt;
On the assumption that ''bucket'' and ''pail'' mean the same, the pattern of characters B: ''If you have a bucket, then you have a pail'' contains ten word-tokens, seven word-types, and six word-meanings.
&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sentence-token'''&lt;ref name=sentence-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Sentence-token''' A sentence-token is a pattern of word-tokens.&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters D: ''He is grnd'' is a sentence-token because ''grnd'' is a word-token (albeit not a '''meaningful''' word-token.)
&lt;/ref&gt; is a pattern of word-tokens.
A '''meaningful-sentence-token'''&lt;ref name=meaningful-sentence-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Meaningful-sentence-token''' A meaningful-sentence-token is a meaningful sentence-token or a meaningful pattern of meaningful-word-tokens.&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters D: ''He is grnd'' is not a sentence-token because grnd is not a meaningful word-token.
&lt;/ref&gt;
is a meaningful sentence-token or a meaningful pattern of meaningful-word-tokens.
Two sentence-tokens are of the same sentence-type if they are identical patterns of word-tokens characters&lt;ref name=sentence-type group="nb"&gt;
'''Sentence-type''' Two sentence-tokens are of the same sentence-type if they are identical patterns of word-tokens characters, e.g. the sentence-tokens P: ''I'm Spartacus'' and Q: ''I'm Spartacus'' are of the same sentence-type.&lt;/ref&gt;
A '''declarative-sentence-token''' is a sentence-token which that can be used to communicate truth or convey information.&lt;ref name=declarative-sentence-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Declarative-sentence-token''' A declarative-sentence-token is a sentence-token which that can be used to communicate truth or convey information.&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters E: ''Are you happy?'' is not a declarative-sentence-token because it interrogative not declarative.
&lt;/ref&gt;
A '''meaningful-declarative-sentence-token''' is a meaningful declarative-sentence-token&lt;ref name=meaningful-declarative-sentence-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens'''
A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token is a meaningful declarative-sentence-token.&lt;br /&gt; 
The pattern of characters F: ''Cats blows the wind'' is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token because it is grammatically ill-formed&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters G: ''This stone is thinking about Vienna'' is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token because thinking cannot be predicated of a stone&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters H: ''This circle is square'' is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token because it is internally inconsistent&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters D: ''He is grnd''  is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token because it contains a word-token (''grnd'') which is not a meaningful-word-token
&lt;/ref&gt;
Two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens are of the same '''meaningful-declarative-sentence-type'''&lt;ref name=Meaningful-declarative-sentence-type group="nb"&gt;
'''Meaningful-declarative-sentence-types'''
Two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens are of the same meaningful-declarative-sentence-type if they are identical patterns of word-tokens characters, e.g. the sentence-tokens P: ''I'm Spartacus'' and Q: ''I'm Spartacus'' are of the same meaningful-declarative-sentence-type. In other words a sentence-type is a meaningful-declarative-sentence-type if all tokens of which are meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens
&lt;/ref&gt;
if they are identical patterns of word-tokens.
A '''nonsense-declarative-sentence-token'''&lt;ref name=nonsense-declarative-sentence-token group="nb"&gt;
'''Nonsense-declarative-sentence-token'''
A nonsense-declarative-sentence-token is a declarative-sentence-token which is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token.&lt;br /&gt;
The patterns of characters F: ''Cats blows the wind'', G: ''This stone is thinking about Vienna'' and H: ''This circle is square'' are nonsense-declarative-sentence-tokens because they are declarative-sentence-tokens but not meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens. The pattern of characters D: ''He is grnd'' is not a nonsense-declarative-sentence-token because it is not a declarative-sentence-token because it contains a word-token (''grnd'') which is not a meaningful-word-token.
&lt;/ref&gt;
is a declarative-sentence-token which is not a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token.
A '''meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use'''&lt;ref name=meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use group="nb"&gt;
'''Meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use'''
A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use occurs when and only when a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token is used declaratively, rather than, say, mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern of characters T: ''Spartacus did not eat all his spinach in London on Feb 11th 2009'' is a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token but, in all probability, it has never been used declaratively and thus there have been no meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses of T.  A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token can be used zero to many times. Two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens-uses of the same meaningful-declarative-sentence-type are identical if and only if they are identical events in time and space with identical users.
&lt;/ref&gt;
occurs when and only when a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token is used declaratively.

A '''referring-expression'''&lt;ref name=referring-expression group="nb"&gt;
'''Referring-expression''' An expression that can be used to pick out or refer to particular entity, such as definite descriptions and proper names
&lt;/ref&gt;
is expression that can be used to pick out or refer to particular entity.
A '''referential success'''&lt;ref name=referential-success group="nb"&gt;
'''Referential success''' a referring-expression’s success in identifying a particular entity OR a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use’s containing one or more referring-expression all of which succeed in identifying a particular entity
&lt;/ref&gt;
is a referring-expression’s success in identifying a particular entity.
A '''referential failure'''&lt;ref name=referential-failure group="nb"&gt;
'''Referential failure''' a referring-expression’s failure to identify a particular entity is referentially successful OR a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use’s containing one or more referring-expression that fail to identify a particular entity.
&lt;/ref&gt;
is a referring-expression’s failure to identify a particular entity.
A '''referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use'''&lt;ref name=Referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use group="nb"&gt;
'''Referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use'''  A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use containing no referring-expression that fails to identify a particular entity. A use of a token of the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type U: ''The King of France is bald’'  is a referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use if (and only if) the embedded referring-expression ‘The King of France’ is referentially successful.  No use of a token of the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type V: ''The highest prime has no factors other than itself and 1'' is not a referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use since the embedded referring-expression ''The highest prime'' is always a referential failure.
&lt;/ref&gt;
is a meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-use containing no referring-expression that fails to identify a particular entity.

==Sentences in natural languages==
As Aristotle pointed out, since some sentences are questions, commands, or meaningless, not all can be truth-bearers.
If in the proposal  "What makes the sentence ''Snow is white'' true is the fact that snow is white"   it is assumed that  '''sentences''' like ''Snow is white'' are truth-bearers, then it would be more clearly stated as "What makes the meaningful-declarative-sentence  ''Snow is white'' true is the fact that snow is white".

'''Theory 1a: '''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only meaningful-declarative-sentence-'''types'''&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;*'''Meaningful-declarative-sentence-types'''
Two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens are of the same meaningful-declarative-sentence-type if they are identical patterns of word-tokens characters, e.g. the sentence-tokens P and Q above are of the same meaningful-declarative-sentence-type. In other words a sentence-type is a meaningful-declarative-sentence-type if its tokens of are meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens&lt;/ref&gt;)
are truth-bearers 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Criticisms of Theory 1a'''

Some meaningful-declarative-sentence-'''types''' will be both truth and false, contrary to our definition of truth-bearer, e.g. (i)  the liar-paradox sentences such as "This sentence is false". (see Fisher 2008&lt;ref name="Fisher 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|title=Philosophy of Logic|year=2008|isbn=0-495-00888-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) (ii) Time, place and person dependent sentences e.g. "It is noon". "This is London", "I'm Spartacus".

''Anyone may ..ascribe truth and falsity to the deterministic propositional signs we here call utterances.  But if he takes this line, he must, like Leibniz, recognise that truth cannot be an affair solely of actual utterances, since it makes sense to talk of the discovery of previously un-formulated truths.'' (Kneale, W&amp;M (1962)&lt;ref name="Kneale 1962"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kneale|first=W&amp;M|title=The development of logic|publisher=Oxford|year=1962|isbn=0-19-824183-6}} page 593&lt;/ref&gt;)

'''Revision to Theory 1a''', by making a distinction between type and token.

To escape the time, place and person dependent criticism the theory can be revised, making use or the [[type–token distinction]],&lt;ref&gt;see Wolfram, Sybil (1989) generally on the application of type–token distinction&lt;/ref&gt;  as follows

'''Theory 1b: '''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens are truth-bearers 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Quine argued that the '''primary''' truth-bearers are utterances &lt;ref group="nb"&gt;'''Utterance''': The term ''utterance'' is frequently used to mean ''meaningful-declarative-sentence-token.'' See e.g. Grice, '''Meaning''', 1957 http://semantics.uchicago.edu/kennedy/classes/f09/semprag1/grice57.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Having now recognised in a general way that what are true are sentences, we must turn to certain refinements.  What are best seen as primarily true or false are not sentences but events of utterances.  If a man utters the words 'It is raining' in the rain, or the words 'I am hungry' while hungry, his verbal performance counts as true.  Obviously one utterance of a sentence may be true and another utterance of the same sentence be false.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
QUINE 1970&lt;ref name="QUINE 1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=QUINE |first=W.V.|title=Philosophy of Logic|year=1970|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-663625-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; page 13

'''Criticisms of Theory 1b'''

(i) Theory 1b prevents sentences which are meaningful-declarative-sentence-types from being truth-bearers.  If all meaningful-declarative-sentence-types typographically identical to "The whole is greater than the part" are true then it surely follows that the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type "The whole is greater than the part" is true (just as all meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens typographically identical to "The whole is greater than the part" are English [[logical consequence|entails]] the meaningful-declarative-sentence-types "The whole is greater than the part" is English) (ii) Some meaningful-declarative-sentences-tokens will be both truth and false, or neither, contrary to our definition of truth-bearer.  E.g. A token, t, of the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type ‘P: I'm Spartacus’, written on a placard.  The token t would be true when used by Spartacus, false when used by Bertrand Russell, neither true nor false when mentioned by Spartacus or when being neither used nor mentioned.

'''Theory 1b.1'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses are truth-bearers;  some meaningful-declarative-sentence-types are truth-bearers
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
To allow that at least some meaningful-declarative-sentence-types can be truth-bearers Quine allowed so-called eternal sentences&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;'''Eternal Sentence''': A sentence that stays forever true, or forever false, independently of any special circumstances under which they happen to be uttered or written.  More exactly,  a meaningful-declarative-sentence-type whose tokens have the same truth values. E.g. ''The whole is greater than the part'' is an eternal sentence, ''It is raining'' is not an eternal sentence but ''It rains in Boston, Mass., on July 15, 1968'' is an eternal sentence&lt;/ref&gt; to be truth-bearers.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Peirces's terminology, utterances and inscriptions are ''tokens'' of the sentence or other linguistic expression concerned; and this linguistic expression is the ''type'' of those utterances and inscriptions.  In Frege's terminology, truth and falsity are the two ''truth values''.  Succinctly then, an eternal sentence is a sentence whose tokens have the same truth values.... What are best regarded as true and false are not propositions but sentence tokens, or sentences if they are eternal &lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Quine 1970&lt;ref name="QUINE 1970"/&gt; pages 13–14

'''Theory 1c'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses are truth-bearers 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Arguments for Theory 1c'''

By respecting the [[use–mention]] Theory 1c avoids criticism (ii) of Theory 1b.

'''Criticisms of Theory 1c'''

(i) Theory 1c does not avoid criticism (i) of Theory 1b. (ii) meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses are events (located in particular positions in time and space) and entail a user.  This implies that (a) nothing (no truth-bearer) exists and hence nothing (no truth-bearer) is true (of false) anytime anywhere (b) nothing (no truth-bearer) exists and hence nothing (no truth-bearer) is true (of false) in the absence of a user.  This implies that (a)  nothing was true before the evolution of users capable of using meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens and (b) nothing is true (or false) accept when being used (asserted) by a user.  Intuitively the truth (or falsity) of ‘The tree continues to be in the quad’ continues in the absence of an agent to asset it.

'''Referential Failure'''
A problem of some antiquity is the status of sentences such as 
U: The King of France is bald
V: The highest prime has no factors
W: Pegasus did not exist 
Such sentences purport to refer to entitles which do not exist (or do not always exist). They are said to suffer from referential failure.  We are obliged to choose either (a) That they are not truth-bearers and consequently neither true nor false or (b) That they are truth-bearers and per se are either true of false.

'''Theory 1d'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses are truth-bearers.  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Theory 1d takes option (a) above by declaring that meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses that fail referentially are not truth-bearers.

'''Theory 1e'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token-uses are truth-bearers;  some meaningful-declarative-sentence-types are truth-bearers
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Arguments for Theory 1e'''

Theory 1e has the same advantages as Theory 1d.  Theory 1e allows for the existence of truth-bearers (i.e., meaningful-declarative-sentence-types) in the absence of users and between uses.  If for any x, where x is a use of a referentially successful token of a meaningful-declarative-sentence-type y x is a truth-bearer then y is a truth-bearer otherwise y is not a truth bearer.  E.g. If all uses of all referentially successful tokens of the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type ‘The whole is greater than the part’ are truth-bearers (i.e. true or false) then the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type ‘The whole is greater than the part’ is a truth-bearer.  If some but not all uses of some referentially successful tokens of the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type ‘I am Spartacus’ are true then the meaningful-declarative-sentence-type ‘I am Spartacus’ is not a truth-bearer.

'''Criticisms of Theory 1e'''

Theory 1e makes implicit use of the concept of an agent or user capable of using (i.e. asserting) a referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-token.  Although Theory 1e does not depend on the actual existence (now, in the past or in the future) of such users, it does depend on the possibility and cogency of their existence.  Consequently, the concept of truth-bearer under Theory 1e is dependent upon giving an account of the concept of a ‘user’.  In so far as referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens are particulars (locatable in time and space) the definition of truth-bearer just in terms of referentially-successful-meaningful-declarative-sentence is attractive to those who are (or would like to be) nominalists. The introduction of ‘use’ and ‘users’ threatens the introduction of intentions, attitudes, minds &amp;c. as less-than=welcome ontological baggage

==Sentences in languages of classical logic==

In [[classical logic]] a [[Sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]] in a language is true or false under (and only under) an [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] and is therefore a truth-bearer. For example, a language in the [[first-order predicate calculus]] might include one of more predicate symbols and one or more individual constants and one or more variables.  The interpretation of such a language would define a domain (universe of discourse); assign an element of the domain to each individual constant; assign the donation in the domain of some property to each unary (one-place) predicate symbol.&lt;ref&gt;See also '[[First-order logic#Semantics]]&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a language L consisted in the individual constant ''a'', two unary predicate letters ''F'' and ''G'' and the variable ''x'', then an interpretation I of L might define the Domain D as animals, assign Socrates to ''a'',  the denotation of the property being a man to ''F'' and the denotation of the property being mortal to ''G''.  Under the interpretation I of L then ''Fa'' would be true [[if and only if|if, and only if]] Socrates is a man,  and the sentence ''{{all}}(Fx {{imp}} Gx)'' would be true if, and only if all men (in the domain) are mortal.  In some texts an interpretation is said to give   [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|"meaning"]] to the symbols of the language.  Since ''Fa'' has the value true under some (but not all interpretations) it is not the sentence-type ''Fa'' which is said to be true but only some sentence-tokens of ''Fa'' under particular interpretations. A token of ''Fa'' without an interpretation is neither true nor false.  Some sentences of a Language like L are said to be true under all interpretations of the sentence, e.g. ''{{all}}(Fx {{or-}} {{not}}Fx),'' such sentences being termed [[logical truth]]s, but again such sentences are neither true nor false in the absence of an interpretation.

==Propositions==
Many authors&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Russell, Wittgenstein, and Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy URL = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/facts/#FacPro:  "By ‘proposition’, we shall mean truth-bearer, and remain neutral as to whether truth-bearers are sentences, statements, beliefs or abstract objects expressed by sentences, for instance—except in section 2.4.1."&lt;/ref&gt; use the term '''[[proposition]]''' as truth-bearers.  There is no single definition or usage.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, Matthew, "Propositions", The Stanford (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/propositions/&gt;."The term ‘proposition’ has a broad use in contemporary philosophy. It is used to refer to some or all of the following: the primary bearers of truth-value, the objects of belief and other “propositional attitudes” (i.e., what is believed, doubted, etc.), the referents of that-clauses, and the meanings of sentences."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Propositions |last=Mark |first=Richard |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3446801663/propositions.html |date=2006 |quote=On one use of the term, "propositions" are objects of assertion, what successful uses of declarative sentences say. As such, they determine truth-values and truth conditions. On a second, they are the objects of certain psychological states (such as belief and wonder) ascribed with verbs that take sentential complements (such as believe and wonder ). On a third use, they are what are (or could be) named by the complements of such verbs. Many assume that propositions in one sense are propositions in the others.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is used to mean a ''meaningful declarative sentence'' itself; sometimes it is used to mean '''the meaning of''' a meaningful declarative sentence.&lt;ref&gt;"Philosopher's tolerance towards propositions has been encouraged partly by ambiguity in the term 'proposition'. The term often is used simply for the sentences themselves, declarative sentences; and then some writers who do use the term for meanings of sentences are careless about the distinction between sentences and their meanings"  Quine 1970, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This provides two possible definitions for the purposes of discussion as below

'''Theory 2a''': &lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only meaningful-declarative-sentences are propositions
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Theory 2b''':&lt;blockquote&gt;
A meaningful-declarative-sentence-token expresses a proposition; two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens which have the same meaning express the same proposition; two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens with different meanings express different propositions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; (cf Wolfram 1989,&lt;ref name="Wolfram 1989 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Sybil|publisher=Routledge|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;21)

''Proposition'' is not always used in one or other of these ways.

'''Criticisms of Theory 2a.'''  
* If all and only meaningful-declarative-sentences '''are''' propositions, as advanced by Theory 2a, then the terms are synonymous and we can just as well speak of the meaningful-declarative-sentences themselves as the trutbearers - there is no distinct concept of proposition to consider, and the term ''proposition'' is literally redundant.

'''Criticisms of Theory 2b'''
* Theory 2b entails that if all meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens typographically identical to say, "I am Spartacus" have the same meaning then they (i) express the same proposition (ii) that proposition is both true and false,&lt;ref&gt;i.e. when expressed by a token-meaningful-declarative-sentence made by Spartacus, and when expressed by somebody other than Spartacus&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to the definition of truth-bearer.
* The concept of a proposition in this theory rests upon the concept of meaning as applied to meaningful-declarative-sentences, in a word '''synonymy''' among meaningful-declarative-sentence s.  Quine 1970 argues that the concept of synonymy among meaningful-declarative-sentences cannot be sustained or made clear, consequently the concepts of "propositions" and "meanings of sentences" are, in effect, vacuous and superfluous&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophers who favor propositions have said that propositions are needed because truth only of propositions, not of sentences [read ''meaningful-declarative-sentences'' Ed], is intelligible. An unsympathetic answer is that we can explain truth of sentences to be propositional in their own terms: sentences are true whose meanings are true propositions.  Any failure of intelligibilty here is already his own fault." Quine 1970 page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

see also [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Proposition]], ''The Russell-Myhill Antinomy'', also known as the ''Principles of Mathematics Appendix B Paradox''[http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/par-rusm.htm]

see also [http://www.iep.utm.edu/truth/#SH4b Internet Encycypedia of Philosophy] ''Propositions are abstract entities; they do not exist in space and time. They are sometimes said to be “timeless”, “eternal”, or “omnitemporal” entities. Terminology aside, the essential point is that propositions are not concrete (or material) objects. Nor, for that matter, are they mental entities; they are not “thoughts” as Frege had suggested in the nineteenth century. The theory that propositions are the bearers of truth-values also has been criticized. Nominalists object to the abstract character of propositions. Another complaint is that it’s not sufficiently clear when we have a case of the same propositions as opposed to similar propositions. This is much like the complaint that we can’t determine when two sentences have exactly the same meaning. The relationship between sentences and propositions is a serious philosophical problem.''

==Statements==
Many authors consider ''statements'' as truth-bearers, though as with the term "proposition" there is divergence in definition and usage of that term. Sometimes 'statements' are taken to be meaningful-declarative-sentences; sometimes they are thought to be what is asserted by a meaningful-declarative-sentence.  It is not always clear in which sense the word is used. This provides two possible definitions for the purposes of discussion as below.

A particular concept of a statement was introduced by Strawson in the 1950s.,&lt;ref name="Strawson 1950"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strawson|first=PF|year=1950|title=On referring|journal=Mind|volume=9}} reprinted in Strawson 1971 and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strawson 1957"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strawson|first=PF|year=1957|title=Propositions, Concepts and Logical Truths|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|volume=7}} reprinted in {{cite book| title= Logico-Linguistic Papers|last=Strawson|first=P.F.|year=1971| publisher= Methuen| isbn= 0-416-09010-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strawson 1952" /&gt;

Consider the following:
*I: The author of [[Waverley (novel)|Waverley]] is dead
*J: The author of [[Ivanhoe]] is dead
*K: I am less than six feet tall
*L: I am over six feet tall
*M: The conductor is a bachelor
*N: The conductor is married

On the assumption that the same person wrote Waverley and Ivanhoe, the two distinct patterns of characters (meaningful-declarative-sentences) I and J make the same statement but express different propositions. &lt;br /&gt;
The pairs of meaningful-declarative-sentences (K, L) &amp; (M, N) have different meanings, but they are not necessarily contradictory, since K &amp; L may have been asserted by different people, and M &amp; N may have been asserted about different conductors.

''What these examples show is that we cannot identify that which is true or false (the statement) with the sentence used in making it; for the same sentence may be used to make different statements, some of them true and some of them false.'' (Strawson, P.F. (1952)&lt;ref name="Strawson 1952"&gt;
{{cite book|last=Strawson |first=P.F.|title=Introduction to Logical Theory|publisher=Methuen: London|year=1952|pages=4|isbn=0-416-68220-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

This suggests:

* Two meaningful-declarative-sentence-tokens which say the same thing of the same object(s) make the same statement.

'''Theory 3a'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only statements are meaningful-declarative-sentences. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
'''Theory 3b'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All and only meaningful-declarative-sentences can be used to make statements 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Statement'' is not always used in one or other of these ways.

'''Arguments for Theory 3a'''
* "All and only statements are meaningful-declarative-sentences." is either a stipulative definition or a descriptive definition.  If the former, the stipulation is useful or it is not; if the latter, either the descriptive definition correctly describes English usage or it does not. In either case no arguments, as such, are applicable

'''Criticisms of Theory 3a'''

* If the term ''statement'' is synonymous with the term ''meaningful-declarative-sentence'', then the applicable criticisms are the same as those outlined under sentence below
* If all and only meaningful-declarative-sentences '''are''' statements, as advanced by Theory 3a, then the terms are synonymous and we can just as well speak of the meaningful-declarative-sentences themselves as the truth-bearers – there is no distinct concept of statement to consider, and the term ''statement'' is literally redundant.

'''Arguments for Theory 3b'''

== Thoughts ==
Frege (1919) argued that an indicative sentence in which we communicate or state something, contains both a thought and an assertion, it expresses the thought, and the thought is the sense of the sentence.&lt;ref name="Frege 1919"&gt;Frege (1919) ''Die Gedanke'' trans AM and Marcelle Quinton in {{cite journal|last=Frege|first=G|year=1956|title=The thought: A logical Enquiry|journal=Mind|volume=65}} reprinted in Strawson 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vittoria Piisimi''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 1595), was an Italian actress, singer, dancer, theatre director and musician. She was one of the most famous Italian actors of the period and known as the ''"divine Vittoria Piisimi"''. She and [[Isabella Andreini]] were the two most famed actresses of the era and described as great rivals.

==Life==
Piisimi was the [[primadonna]] of the famous [[commedia dell’arte]] [[Gelosi Company]] of [[Flaminio Scala]]. The company, first mentioned in 1568, was the first Commedia to tour outside Italy when it performed in [[Paris]] in 1571, and was described as the foremost commedia dell’arte troupe. Piisimi is first mentioned in 1573 and is confirmed as a member of the Gelosi troupe in 1574. she would in fact have been active earlier, as it was known that her lover, actor [[Adriano Valerini]] from [[Verona]], left her for [[Vincenza Armani]], who died in 1569, four years before 1573.

Piisimi received great praise and replaced Armani as the primadonna of the Italian theatre. Piisimi combined her acting with singing, dancing and by writing music and was reportedly admired also in these fields. She was called ''comica gelosa'' and mainly played the parts of heroine and subretto. On 24 July 1574, she performed for [[Henry III of France]] in the role of [[Pallas Athena]] in Venice, where she received great praise. At this point, she was the most famous actress in Italy and was known outside of Italy. Her performance was especially requested by the French monarch upon his visit to Venice in 1574. In 1579-1581, she was the leader of her own theatre company.

In 1589, the Gelosi troupe performed in [[Florence]] at the wedding of Grand Duke [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinand de Medici]] and [[Christina of Lorraine]]. At this event, the "rival prima donnas" Vittoria Piisimi performed as the gypsy in ''Zingara'' and Isabella Andreini as the madwoman in ''La Pazzia d’Isabella''. Their performances were considered the great highlight of the event and became a famous event of their rivalry.

In 1592, Piisimi left the Gelosi theatre. She was for a time the director of the Gli Uniti company. She returned to the Gelosi company in 1595.

The death date of Piisimi is unknown. She is last mentioned in 1595.

'''William Woodville Rockhill''' (May 1, 1854 &amp;ndash; December 8, 1914) was a [[United States]] [[diplomat]], best known as the author of the U.S.'s [[Open Door Policy]] for [[China]] and as the first American to learn to speak [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]].

==Life and career==
Rockhill was born in [[Philadelphia]], the son of Thomas Cadwalader Rockhill and Dorothea Anne Woodville (1823–1913). His father died when he was 13 years old and his mother relocated the family to [[France]] to escape the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name="orchidbooks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orchidbooks.com/book_reviews/rockhill_asian_affairs.html |title=R.

In 1876, Rockhill returned to the United States, and on December 14, 1876, he married his childhood sweetheart, Caroline Tyson, daughter of J. Washington Tyson and Marie Louise (Hewling) Tyson of Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt;  The couple purchased a [[cattle ranch]] in [[New Mexico]], but Rockhill concluded that ranching was not to his liking.&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt;  By 1880, he had completed a [[French language]] translation of the Tibetan version of the ''[[Udanavarga]]'', which was published in 1881.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Close+encounters+of+an+American+kind%3A+William+Woodville+Rockhill+in...-a053889292 Karl E. Meyer, "Close Encounters of an American Kind", ''World Policy Journal'' (Dec. 22, 1998)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rockhills sold the ranch in 1881 and moved to [[Montreux]], Switzerland, where William's mother lived.&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt;  He spent the next three years in Europe studying Tibetan, [[Sanskrit]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].&lt;ref name="orchidbooks" /&gt;  During this period, he co-authored a biography of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] with [[Nanjo Bunyu]] and [[Ernst Leumann]], and completed a [[French language]] translation of the [[Prātimokṣa]] [[sūtra]], published in 1884 under the title ''Prâtimoksha sutra; ou, Le traité d'émancipation selon la version tibétaine: avec notes et extraits du Dulva (Vinaya)''.&lt;ref name="orchidbooks" /&gt;

In 1883, Rockhill's wife came into a $70,000 inheritance on the death of a cousin, allowing Rockhill to take an unpaid position with the American [[Legation]] in [[Peking]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Close+encounters+of+an+American+kind%3A+William+Woodville+Rockhill+in...-a053889292 Karl E.

During the administration of [[President of the United States]] [[Grover Cleveland]], Rockhill served as [[Third Assistant Secretary of State]] from April 17, 1894, until February 13, 1896.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/rockhill-william-woodville |title=Profile from State Dept. Historian |publisher=History.state.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then served as [[United States Assistant Secretary of State]] under [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Richard Olney]] from February 14, 1896, until May 10, 1897.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

In 1897, President [[William McKinley]] named Rockhill [[United States Ambassador to Greece|U.S. Minister to Greece]], a position he held from September 25, 1897, to April 27, 1899.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;  He concurrently served as [[United States Ambassador to Serbia|Minister to Serbia]] from May 7, 1898, to April 27, 1899, and as [[United States Ambassador to Romania|Minister to Romania]] from May 18, 1898, to April 27, 1899.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

With the outbreak of the [[Boxer Rebellion]], U.S. Secretary of State [[John Hay]], who knew little of the Far East, turned to Rockhill for guidance.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary" /&gt;  As such, Rockhill drafted a memorandum that spelled out the famous [[Open Door Policy]] towards China; this memorandum was circulated to [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[France]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] and in March 1900, Secretary Hay announced that all the [[Great Powers]] had signed off on the Open Door Policy.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary" /&gt;  Rockhill was then despatched as President McKinley's [[special envoy]], where he represented the U.S. in the Conference of Ministers that followed the ending of the Boxer Rebellion.  During the negotiations surrounding the [[Boxer Protocol]], Rockhill argued against full [[war reparations]], instead encouraging the Great Powers to settle for a lump sum of $333 million in reparations to be divided amongst the Powers in proportion to their expenses incurred in intervening in China.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary" /&gt;  At Rockhill's urging, the American share of war reparations was used to fund student exchanges between China and the U.S.(a program known as the [[Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program]]).&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary" /&gt;

In 1905, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] appointed Rockhill [[United States Ambassador to China|U.S. Minister to China]], a position he held from June 17, 1905, until June 1, 1909.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;  This appointment came in the wake of the [[British Expedition to Tibet]] (1903–1904) that had forced [[Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama]] into isolation.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary" /&gt;  Learning that Rockhill spoke Tibetan, the Dalai Lama entered into a correspondence that was to last until Rockhill's death.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary" /&gt;  In June 1908, Rockhill made a five-day on-foot trek to [[Mount Wutai]] to meet the Dalai Lama and successfully convinced the Dalai Lama to seek peace with China and Britain.&lt;ref name="thefreelibrary" /&gt;

In 1909, President [[William Howard Taft]] named Rockhill [[United States Ambassador to Russia|Minister to Russia]] and Rockhill held this post from January 11, 1910, until June 17, 1911.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;  President Taft then named him [[United States Ambassador to Turkey|Minister to Turkey]], and he held this post from August 28, 1911, until November 20, 1913.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

===Death===
Appointed Advisor to the President of China, [[Yuan Shi Kai]], in 1914, Rockhill sailed San Francisco for China via Japan aboard the SS ''Chiyo Maru''.&lt;ref name=Sacramento&gt;''Sacramento Union'', No. 39, 9 Dec 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; Afflicted by a severe cold he contracted in San Francisco, he developed [[pleurisy]] on the voyage, and had to leave the ship on arrival at [[Honolulu]] for treatment. Four days later, the pleurisy overcome, the ordeal occasioned him heart failure and he died in hospital on 8 December 1914, aged 60.&lt;ref name="jstor" /&gt;  Rockhill is buried in the East Cemetery in [[Litchfield, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lawrence Kestenbaum |url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/robison-rockne.html#RIV004C0P |title=Political Graveyard |publisher=Political Graveyard |date= |accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33757">'''Work–family balance in the United States''' refers to the specific issues that arise when men and women in the United States attempt to balance their occupational lives with their family lives. This differs from [[Work-life balance in the United States|work-life balance]]: while work-life balance may refer to the health and living issues that arise from work, work–family balance refers specifically to how work and families intersect and influence each other. Work–family balance in the U.S. differs significantly for families of different [[Social class in the United States|social class]].

Middle-class family issues center on dual-earner spouses and parents while lower class issues center on problems that arise due to single parenting. Work–family balance issues also differ by class, since middle class occupations provide more benefits and family support while [[Low-wage economy|low-wage jobs]] are less flexible with benefits. Solutions for helping individuals manage work–family balance in the U.S. include legislation, workplace policies, and the marketization of [[care work]].

==History==
Family structure (how the family is organized) historically has been influenced by [[Structural change|social-level]] forces, many of them economic.&lt;ref name="Coontz_00"&gt;Coontz, Stephanie. 2000. "Historical Perspectives on Family Studies." Journal of Marriage and the Family 62: 283-297.&lt;/ref&gt; According to family historian [[Stephanie Coontz]], marriage and family formation in the 17th century was heavily influenced by desires to form economic and political alliances. Children were seen as a method of ensuring the passage of political and economic power to future generations.&lt;ref name="Coontz_06"&gt;Coontz, Stephanie. Marriage: A History. New York: Penguin, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by [[the Englightenment]], several changes to marriage occurred: the move toward individualism and the loosening of church influence over families after the [[Protestant Reformation]] resulted in the flourishing of the two-parent farm family.&lt;ref name="Coontz_06"/&gt; Prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]], the two-parent farm family was the dominant family model, in which both parents working side by side on family farms&lt;ref name="Pew"&gt;Pew Research Center. 2010. "The Decline of Marriage and Rise of New Families." Retrieved January 7, 2011 (http://pewsocialtrends.org/2010/11/18/the-decline-of-marriage-and-rise-of-new-families/).&lt;/ref&gt;  The two-parent farm family ceased to be the dominant family model after the [[Industrial Revolution]] occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Barkley, Paul W. 1976. "A Contemporary Political Economy of Family Farming." American Journal of Agricultural Economics 58(5): 812-819.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1920s was the first time that the majority of children lived in two-parent breadwinner-homemaker families (one where the father supported the family financially and the mother supported the family domestically).&lt;ref name="Coontz_00"/&gt;

In 19th century farm settings, children were an important part of their families' agricultural livelihoods.&lt;ref name="Coontz_00"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hammel, E.A., Sheila R. Johansson, and Caren A. Ginsberg. 1983. "The Value of Children During Industrialization: Sex Ratios in Childhood in Nineteenth-Century America." Journal of Family History 8: 346-366.&lt;/ref&gt; As industrialization occurred and families shifted from rural agricultural settings to urban ones, the number of children per household also declined. Children became less of an economic benefit and more of a cost: urban life necessitated educating children which was costly.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Robert V. 1975. "Family History and Demographic Transition." Journal of Social History 9(1): 1-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1910s and 1920s, women delayed childbirth for economic opportunities that were present in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Cookingham, Mary E. 1984. "Combining Marriage, Motherhood, and Jobs Before World War II: Women College Graduates, Classes of 1903-1935." Journal of Family History 9(2): 178-195.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this trend reversed during the [[Great Depression]] because of the lower number of economic opportunities available for women. As a result, Depression Era women were more likely to marry and have children earlier. In 1900, roughly 40 percent of single women were employed versus only five percent of married women (Preston, 2003). This 35 percent gap persisted for many years. Goldin (1992), in a study of women college graduates in the twentieth century, concluded that those graduating between 1900 and 1920 had to make "a distinct choice between family and career" &lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Rosalind Chait. 2004. Preface: Women and Work: Where Are We, Where Did We Come From, and Where Are We Going?Journal of Social Issues.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Works Progress Administration]] opened about 3,000 part-day Emergency Nusery Schools for about 75,000 children from 1933 to 1935, which provided child care to help eligible adults looking for work and which employed teachers in an industry where two-thirds of private nursery schools had closed during the Depression.&lt;ref name="vcu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;https://www.npr.org/2015/01/24/379530251/u-s-once-had-universal-child-care-but-rebuilding-it-wouldnt-be-easy&lt;/ref&gt;   Men were drafted into the military in large numbers during World War II, and women with young children were needed to supplement single women and those with older children at wartime factories.  Problems with women leaving children in unsafe situations while working began to appear.&lt;ref&gt;https://thinkprogress.org/heres-what-happened-the-one-time-when-the-u-s-had-universal-childcare-c965a3178112#.1kl2xmgdd&lt;/ref&gt;  ENS capacity peaked at 130,00 children in 1944.&lt;ref name="vcu"&gt;http://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/programs/child-care-the-american-history/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;  [[New Deal#Wartime welfare projects|Wartime New Deal measures]] such as the Lanham Act and Servicemen's Dependents Allowance Act of 1942 provided federal funding for day care centers starting in 1942.

The [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]]–[[homemaker]] model regained dominance during the twenty-year period immediately after World War II.&lt;ref name="Pew"/&gt; The [[Economy of the United States|economy]] relied upon the male [[Breadwinner model|breadwinner]] to earn the income to support his family financially, while women were relied upon to do the [[care work]] and other forms of domestic work to support her husband's earnings.

As the economy went into [[1970s recession|recession during the 1970s]], women entered the workforce in large droves. Families could no longer survive on the single income of the male breadwinner and both sexes were relied upon for financial support. The dominant family model starting in the 1970s was the dual-earner family where both parents worked.&lt;ref name="Pew"/&gt; Women also entered college in higher percentages.&lt;ref name="Torr"&gt;Torr, Berna M. 2011. "The Changing Relationship between Education and Marriage in the United States, 1940-2000." Journal of Family History 36(4): 483-503.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the economy was still assumed to run on an outdated breadwinner-homemaker model as evidence by the following things: women made significantly less income than men, they were still expected to do the majority of domestic work, and the nine-to-three o'clock school schedule of children still existed. The recession of the 1970s also further pushed the correlation between income and family structure. As more and more previously lucrative manufacturing jobs [[Outsourcing|were sent overseas]], men without college educations could no longer support their families on a single wage. Women's labor force participation rates have steadily increased since the 1940s&lt;ref name="Pew"/&gt; Since the 1970s, the relationship between marriage and college education has also been positive.&lt;ref name="Torr"/&gt;

Congress passed the Comprehensive Child Development Act in 1971, which subsidized child care to make it universal, but the bill was vetoed by President [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;https://thinkprogress.org/why-america-gave-up-on-the-fight-for-a-family-friendly-workplace-and-why-its-starting-again-54f536b27572#.lmabnqak4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
Historically significant pieces of legislation have been enacted at the federal level to address the sex disparities in the workplace. These pieces of legislation attempt to address the [[Male-female income disparity in the USA|wage gap in the U.S.]], gender discrimination in hiring and firing, and the occupational rights of workers in taking family and medical leave. Despite these significant legislative efforts, the U.S. still lags behind other developed countries in progressive family-friendly work policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suzanne M. Bianchi|Bianchi, Suzanne M.]] and Melissa A. Milkie. 2010. "Work and Family Research in the First Decade of the 21st Century." Journal of Marriage and Family 72: 705-725.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Equal Pay Act of 1963====
The [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]] attempted to abolish wage and payment discrimination between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964====
[[Title VII]] mandates against gender discrimination in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/titlevii.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; It makes gender discrimination on the basis of pregnancy and childbirth illegal. The [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act]] of 1978 is an amendment to Title VII that explicitly prohibits discrimination against pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/pregnancy.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993====

The [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] requires employers to provide job-protected unpaid leave for certain family and medical reasons. Legitimate reasons include pregnancy, childbirth, [[adoption]], [[foster care]] placement, and care for an ill family member.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/&lt;/ref&gt; However, this legislation is limited: coverage is only extended for twelve weeks and for employees who have worked for at least twelve months at the same job. Short-term medical illness and routine medical checkups were not covered until the FMLA, and family members other than parents, spouses, and children are not covered. Some states have extended the definition of family on their own, and therefore extended the coverage of FMLA.

==Effects on families==
The structural economic changes have influenced specific aspects of the family.&lt;ref name="Edin"&gt;Edin, Kathryn and Rebecca Joyce Kissane. 2010. "Poverty and the American Family: A Decade in Review." Journal of Marriage and Family 72:460-479.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all families are affected in the same way. In the U.S., whether or not a family is dual or single-earner is related to their social class and income.&lt;ref&gt;Conger, Rand D., Katherine J. Conger, and Monica J. Martin. 2010. "Socioeconomic Status, Family Processes, and Individual Development." Journal of Marriage and Family 72:685-704.&lt;/ref&gt; The economic changes in the past couple of decades have affected [[American middle class|middle-class]] and [[poverty in the united states|lower-class]] families very differently in many aspects, especially since the [[1970s recession|1970s economic recession]]. These family [[Social inequality|inequalities]] significantly affect the intersection of [[Race (United States Census)]] and [[Social class in the United States]] as well.

===Problems affecting middle-class families===
Middle-class families have certain class-specific problems that arise when family and work intersects. Many of them have to do with the balance parents must create between their career aspirations and their familial desires. Because the middle class has greater access to more stable occupations and the chances for occupational [[Career Moves|mobility]], many middle class American families must deal with the ultimate decision between balancing their families with their jobs. Although the figures vary depending on parents' household income, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates families spend anywhere from $134,370 to $269,520 raising a child from birth through age 17.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Robin W. "The Joys of Parenthood, Reconsidered." Contexts 7.2 (2008): 40-45. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Delayed fertility====
Middle class women oftentimes delay [[motherhood]] until after the peak of their [[Fertility rate|fertility]] at age 29–30, a delay that has become more common in the last two decades.&lt;ref&gt;Abma, Joyce C. and Gladys M. Martinez. 2006. "Childlessness Among Older Women in the United States: Trends and Profiles." ''Journal of Marriage and Family'' 68 (1045–1056)&lt;/ref&gt; Motherhood is delayed because of the higher educational and career aspirations middle class women oftentimes make&lt;ref&gt;Martin, S. P. 2000. "Diverging fertility among US women who delay childbearing past age 30." ''Demography'', 37 (523–533)&lt;/ref&gt;—the career incentives are too great to pass up.&lt;ref name="Caucutt"&gt;Caucutt, Elizabeth M., Nezih Guner, and John Knowles. 2002. "Why Do Women Wait? Matching, Wage Inequality, and the Incentives for Fertility Delay." ''Review of Economic Dynamics'' 5:815–855.&lt;/ref&gt; While middle class women on average have children at age 29, lower class women typically have children much earlier in their lives because of the lack of incentives to delay childbirth.&lt;ref name="Caucutt" /&gt; According to Edin and Kefalas, lower class women do not make the same delay because they are oftentimes lacking the career and [[Higher education in the United States|educational incentives]] that middle class women have.&lt;ref name="Caucutt" /&gt;

The delay in fertility becomes a problem among middle class women when they delay childbirth past their fertility peak.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Pamela. 2007. "The Rhetoric and Reality of 'Opting Out.'" ''Contexts'' 6:14–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Since fertility peaks at a certain age, pushing childbirth past that age significantly decreases the probability that certain women will be able to have children. The media has been an influence on women's fertility choices:&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Jennifer S. and William G. Axinn. 2004. "New Ideas and Fertility Limitation: The Role of Mass Media." ''Journal of Marriage and Family'' 66:1180–1200.&lt;/ref&gt; popular celebrities who have managed to have children well into their forties and other medical miracles covered in the media oftentimes give women false hope that they themselves will also be able to bear children later in life. For every success story, however, there are many more disappointments.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, Nancy. "Making Time for A Baby." ''Time'', April 15, pp. 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ideology of motherhood====
Although American women have made significant strides in the workplace, they are still culturally and socially required to be mothers first and foremost.&lt;ref&gt;Fursman, Lindy. 2002. 'Ideologies of Motherhood and Experiences of Work: Pregnant Women in Management and Professional Careers." Berkeley Collection of Working and Occasional Papers.&lt;/ref&gt; The cultural ideas of motherhood in the U.S. have given birth to a new ideal: a working mother who not only has a wonderful career but also manages to flawlessly balance her family and domestic duties as well. This ideal is known as the "[[Superwoman (sociology)|supermom]]."&lt;ref name="Hays"&gt;Hays, Sharon. "The Mommy Wars: Ambivalence, Ideological Work, and the Cultural Contradictions of Motherhood." In Family in Transition, edited by Arlene S. Skolnick, 40-56. Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The media is a culprit in this depiction: A study examining the portrayal of mothers in magazines showed that the most popular magazines in the U.S. still continue to promote the [[Homemaker|traditional role of motherhood]] while undermining homemakers by portraying them as [[Soccer mom|superficial and negative]].&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;Johnston, Deirdre D., and Debra H. Swanson. 2003. "Invisible Mothers: A Content Analysis of Motherhood Ideologies and Myths in Magazines." Sex Roles 49: 21-33.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, only the Supermom type is portrayed and rarely critiqued.&lt;ref&gt;Dillaway, Heather and Elizabeth Pare. 2008. "Locating Mothers How Cultural Debates About Stay-at-Home Versus Working Mothers Define Women and Home." [[Journal of Family Issues]] 29(4): 437-464.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this Supermom ideal, cultural contradictions of motherhood widely exist. Working mothers are often critiqued for being selfish and not spending enough time with their children.&lt;ref name="Johnston"/&gt; They defend their position by saying they work to support their children economically.&lt;ref name="Hays"/&gt; [[Homemakers]] are often critiqued for not pursuing meaningful careers.&lt;ref name="Johnston"/&gt; They respond by saying that the childcare and other [[domestic work]] they do for their families is much more important. Only the unrealistic depiction of the [[Superwoman (sociology)|supermom]] can balance these two ideological extremes, but that ideal is an unrealistic solution for most women.

====Inequalities in care work====
Despite the career gains women have made, their husbands have not reached parity in terms of their [[Household chore|domestic work]] and [[care work]].&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, Arlie Russell. The Second Shift: Working Parents and the Revolution at Home. New York: Penguin, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Women in the [[developed world]], including the U.S., still do hours more of housework than their male counterparts, despite their success in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;Craig, Lyn and Killian Mullan. 2010. "Parenthood, Gender and Work-Family Time in the United States, Australia, Italy, France, and Denmark." Journal of Marriage and Family 72: 1344-1361.&lt;/ref&gt; Working mothers on average do more work and sleep less than their husbands.&lt;ref name="Maume"&gt;Maume, David J., Rachel A. Sebastian, and Anthony R. Bardo. "Gender, Work-Family Responsibilities, and Sleep." Gender and Society 24(2010): 746-768.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blair-Loy, Mary and Jerry A. Jacobs. "Globalization, Work Hours, and the Care deficit Among Stockbrokers." Gender &amp; Society 17(2003): 230-249&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of who does more housework is also skewed by whether or not the husband or the wife is reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Braun, Michael, Noah Lewin-Epstein, Haya Stier, and Miriam K. Baumgartner. 2008. "Perceived Equity in the Gendered Division of Household Labor." Journal of Marriage and Family 70:1145-1156.&lt;/ref&gt;
Unsurprisingly then, working mothers do not spend a significantly lower amount of time with their children compared to women who do not work—working mothers simply sleep less on average.&lt;ref name="Maume"/&gt;

As a result, many middle-class families have resorted to alternative methods of child care.&lt;ref name="Owens"&gt;Owens, Erica and Gail Ring. 2007. "Difficult Children and Difficult Parents : Constructions by Child Care." [[Journal of Family Issues]] 28(6):827-850.&lt;/ref&gt; A common option is to buy child care, such as [[day care]] providers and centers.&lt;ref name="Owens"/&gt;

===Problems affecting lower-class families===
[[American lower class|Lower class]] families have been heavily influenced by income as well. Lower-class families have a different set of work–family balancing issues, many of which are much more difficult to solve than those of middle-class families.&lt;ref name="Edin"/&gt;

====Single-parenting====
Lower-class families are disproportionately made up of [[single mother]] households. According to Kathryn Edin, this is because of the lack of incentive to marry other lower class men among lower class women, and the desire to save marriage for more quality prospects.&lt;ref name="Edin"/&gt; Unlike middle class women, lower class women do not have the same financial and marriage incentives to marry especially in the face of likely divorce. As a result, lower class mothers have less incentive to delay their [[childbearing]] to later years. Many of the problems shared by single parents are disproportionately felt by the lower class for these very reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Zhan, Min and Shanta Pandey. 2004. "Postsecondary Education and Economic Well-Being of Single Mothers and Single Fathers." Journal of Marriage and Family 66:661-673.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inability to use the income and time of two spouses has a harmful effect upon the work opportunities of lower-income mothers. Another factor is income: single-mothers tend to work lower income wage,&lt;ref&gt;jobs&lt;/ref&gt; which come with few benefits such as [[maternity leave]], [[health insurance]], [[childcare]],&lt;ref name="Press, Julie 2006"&gt;Press, Julie, Jay Fagan, and Elisa Bernd. 2006. "Child Care, Work, and Depressive Symptoms Among Low-Income Mothers." Journal of Family Issues 27(5): 609-632.&lt;/ref&gt; and flexible schedules. [[McJob|Low-wage work]] oftentimes is characterized by weekly [[Shift work|schedule]] changes,&lt;ref name="Wessels"&gt;Wessels, Anke. 2003. "Displacing mothers from work and welfare." UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; little flexibility, and extreme short notice for changes.&lt;ref&gt;Backett-Milburn, Kathryn, Kaura Airey, Linda McKie, and Gillian Hogg. 2008. "Family comes first or open all hours?: How low paid women working in food retailing manage webs of obligation at home and work." The Sociological Review 6(3):474-496.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, lower class mothers have a greater a time crunch and more conflict in balancing their work needs with those of their children. Single mother home environments are much poorer because of nonstandard hours and schedules.&lt;ref&gt;Lleras, Christy. 2008. "Employment, Work Conditions, and the Home Environment in Single-Mother Families." Journal of Family Issues 29(10):1268-1297.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Care work====
Single-mother and lower-class families have a much more difficult time negotiating [[childcare]] or finding sustainable childcare options.&lt;ref name="Press, Julie 2006"/&gt; The breadwinner-homemaker family and economic model does not apply to single-parent families because the single-parent must be both roles at all times.&lt;ref name="Wessels"/&gt; Because [[Day care|child care services]] cost a substantial amount, low-income mothers spend a higher percentage of their income on child care than middle class mothers do.&lt;ref name="Wessels"/&gt; Few low-income mothers are happy with their childcare arrangements&lt;ref name="Wessels"/&gt; especially in light of the fact that low-income childcare arrangements suffer from frequent disruptions.&lt;ref name="Usdansky"&gt;Usdansky, Margaret L. and Douglas A. World. 2008. "When Child Care Breaks Down : Mothers' Experiences With Child Care Problems and Resulting Missed Work." Journal of Family Issues 29(9):1185-1210.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, state assistance for childcare is nowhere near the level of other developed countries and has actually decreased.&lt;ref name="Usdansky"/&gt;

==Solutions==
The United States has lagged behind the [[social benefits]] that support working families when compared to other developed countries.&lt;ref name="Craig"/&gt; Of the twenty-one richest countries in the world, only the United States does not mandate [[paid parental leave]], and among the industrialized Western nations only the United States does not mandate paid vacations.&lt;ref name="Gerson, Kathleen 2010"&gt;Gerson, Kathleen. "Finishing the Gender Revolution." The Unfinished Revolution: How a New Generation Is Reshaping Family, Work, and Gender in America. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Many solutions to the family-work balance problem have been observed in other countries and proposed in the U.S.&lt;ref name="Gerson, Kathleen 2010"/&gt; Solutions specific to the U.S. have also developed recently. Recent U.S. policy has focused on "restoring marriage" rather than providing direct support to children.&lt;ref name="Gerson, Kathleen 2010"/&gt;

===Care crisis===
The [[care work|care crisis]] in the United States refers to the lack of care work as the result of [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Karen V., Rosanna Hertz, and Cameron Macdonald. 2002. "Care and Kinship : An Introduction." Journal of Family Issues 23:703-715.&lt;/ref&gt; For the middle class, there has been an ongoing debate over who should take care of children: family members or child care providers&lt;ref name="Owens"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hickman, Lisa N. 2006. "Who Should Care for Our Children? : The Effects of Home Versus Center Care on Child Cognition and Social Adjustment." Journal of Family Issues 27:652-684.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the debate is slowly shifting to one concerning parents and [[Daycare|child care providers]] to [[domestic workers]]. [[Globalization]] and the entrance of women into the workforce has prompted the mass immigration of transnational care chains - poor women who leave their home countries and go to developed countries to work specifically as domestic workers.&lt;ref name="Hondagneu"&gt;Hondagneu-Sotelo, Pierrette. Domestica: Immigrant Workers Cleaning and Caring in the Shadows of Affluence. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This has become an option for many middle and upper-class families.&lt;ref name="Hondagneu"/&gt;

Poor families, however, still do not have the same care work markets that middle-class families do. Relying on formal child care providers is less disruptive and risky, but providers still pose a significant price problem.&lt;ref name="Usdansky"/&gt;

===Workplace===
There are many [[Family-friendliness|workplace policies]] that can alleviate the burden of work–family balance for many middle-class families. Some options in family-friendly workplaces include providing [[paid leave]] or options for reduced hours.&lt;ref name="Singley, Susan G 2005"&gt;Singley, Susan G. 2005. "Transitions to Parenthood: Work-Family Policies, Gender, and the Couple Context." Gender and Society. 19: 376-397&lt;/ref&gt; Workplaces are realizing that employees with well balanced family and work lives are actually valuable to firms:&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Nick, Tobias Kretschmer, and John van Reenen. 2011. "Are Family-Friendly Workplace Practices a Valuable Firm Resource?" Strategic Management Journal 32:343-367.&lt;/ref&gt; workplace childcare assistance can increase [[productivity]] and [[morale]] among employees, as well as lessen [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]], accidents, and [[absenteeism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sahibzada, Khatera, Leslie B. Hammer, Margaret B. Neal and Daniel C. Kuang. 2005. "The Moderating Effects of Work-Family Role Combinations and Work-Family Organizational Culture on the Relationship Between Family-Friendly Workplace Supports and Job Satisfaction." Journal of Family Issues 26:820-839.&lt;/ref&gt; Childcare options for working parents can be key in [[job satisfaction|workplace satisfaction]].&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;Payne, Stephanie C., Allison L. Cook, and Ismael Diaz. 2011. "Understanding childcare satisfaction and its effect on workplace outcomes: The convenience factor and the mediating role of work-family conflict." Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Workplace supports such as personal time off, paid leave, on-site or nearby childcare, financial assistance for childcare, and other family-friendly policies are Western European workplace norms that could solve the work–family balance problem in the United States.&lt;ref name="Craig"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;

There are many other options of work–family policies that lead to happier and more productive workers.&lt;ref name="Cardenas, R. 2005"&gt;Cardenas, R. &amp; Major, D. (2005). Combining employment and breastfeeding: Utilizing a work-family conflict framework to understand obstacles and solutions.  Journal of Business and Psychology, 20(1), 31-51.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these options include educational classes, such as classes on the wellbeing of a newborn or family, put on by the company, that has been shown to be associated with less reported work–family conflict.&lt;ref name="Frye, N. 2004"&gt;Frye, N. &amp; Breaugh, J.  (2004). Family-friendly policies, supervisor support, work-family conflict, family-work conflict, and satisfaction: A test of a conceptual model.  Journal of Business and Psychology, 19(2), 197-220.&lt;/ref&gt;  A room that would allow for breast milk pumping could be one of the most helpful work–family policies for a company and family.  A 1995 study found 86% of breastfed infants experienced no illness during the 1-year duration of the study &lt;ref&gt;Cohen, R., Mrtek, M., Mrtek, R. (1995). Comparison of maternal absenteeism and infant illness rate among breastfed and formula-feeding woman in to corporations.  American Journal of Health Promotion, 19(2), 148-153.&lt;/ref&gt; and another study found breastfeeding infants decreases the chances of acute infections.&lt;ref&gt;Murtaugh, M. (1997). Optimal breastfeeding duration. Journal of Obstetric, Gynecological, and Neonatal Nursing, 97, 1252-1255.&lt;/ref&gt;  Breastfeeding will help the company because breastfeeding has been linked to lower health care costs.  This prolonged breast feeding saved one company $240,000 in health care savings and $60,000 in reduced absenteeism.&lt;ref name="Cardenas, R. 2005"/&gt;  Some other work–family policies that could help the family and company include various scheduling options, such as paid vacation, flex schedules, working from home, part-time work, and job sharing.  Employees who have this flexibility increase productivity and have less work–family spill over &lt;ref&gt;Hill, J., Erickson, J., Holmes, E, and Ferris, M. (2010). Workplace flexibility, work hours, and work-life conflict: Finding an extra day or two. Journal of Family Psychology, 24(3), 349-358.&lt;/ref&gt; and they are less likely to miss work due to family related issues.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, L., Bauer, T., &amp; Grandey, A. (2003). Work-family conflict and work-related withdrawal behaviors. Journal of Business and Psychology, 17(3), 419-436.&lt;/ref&gt;

One extremely important aspect of all these policies is the management support and work environment that go along with it.  It has been shown multiple times that the work culture influence whether employees take advantage of work–family policies.&lt;ref name="Secret, M. 2000"&gt;Secret, M. (2000). Identifying the family, job, and workplace characteristics of employees who use work-family benefits. Family Relations, 49(2), 217-225.&lt;/ref&gt;  This work culture is a better predictor of use of policies than individual's needs or values.&lt;ref name="Secret, M. 2000"/&gt;  If an individual feels that using a policy will affect his/her chances of advancement he/she is more likely to refuse to use the policy.&lt;ref name="Frye, N. 2004"/&gt;  This is why management support is a big part of this work–family policy.

However, many constrains still exist. These workplace policies are largely only offered at [[White-collar worker|higher salary jobs]],  which are once again out of reach for the poor.&lt;ref name="Wessels"/&gt; The huge lack of government funding at the state and federal levels also make these workplace policies unrealistic at this point.&lt;ref name="Singley, Susan G 2005"/&gt;

===Government support===
If government support for workplace family-friendly policies or childcare subsidies was stronger, more solutions could be attempted. For example, child care subsidies by the government actually result in less childcare and work disruptions and could impact low-income families as well by making childcare more affordable.&lt;ref&gt;Prohaska, Ariane and John F. Zipp. 2011. "Gender Inequality and the Family and Medical Leave Act." Journal of Family Issues 32(11):1425-1448.&lt;/ref&gt; However, government support is not at the level of other developed countries.&lt;ref name="Craig"/&gt; Legislation such as the [[Family and Medical Leave Act]] had little impact on gender inequality in care work and was strongly opposed by businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Forry, Nicole D. and Sandra L. Hofferth. 2011. "Maintaining Work: The Influence of Child Care Subsidies on Child Related Work Disruptions." Journal of Family Issues 32(3):346-368.&lt;/ref&gt;

:Fewer than half of working parents stay home when their children are sick, even though research shows that sick children recover more quickly when a parent is there. …54 percent of working women are not entitled to any paid leave for taking care of a sick child or other family members.&lt;ref name=Crittenden&gt;Crittenden, A. (2001). Conclusion. In A. Crittenden, The Price of Motherhood (p. 239). New York: Holt.&lt;/ref&gt;

If our society were to follow in the footsteps of other countries who allow [[paid time off]] for taking care of sick children or even for having children our country might be able to get rid of the welfare program. Mothers wouldn't need welfare because they could have a job and be able to take care of children. Employers would have to allow parents to leave work to take care of children and they would have to pay them for it as well.  When the parent is still getting a paycheck there would be no need for welfare programs to supplement another income or for a lack of income.
