      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3343">The '''Advanced Airborne Sensor''' ('''AAS''') is a multifunction [[radar]] installed on the [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon|P-8 Poseidon]] maritime patrol aircraft. The radar is built by [[Raytheon]] as a follow-on to their '''[[AN/APY-10#AN/APS-149|AN/APS-149 Littoral Surveillance Radar System]]''' ('''LSRS''').

The AAS has its roots in the highly classified AN/APS-149 LSRS, which was designed to provide multi-function moving target detection and tracking and high resolution ground mapping at standoff ranges covering land, [[littoral zone|littoral]], and water areas. The radar was deployed on a small number of [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orions]], with "game changing" results. Containing a double-sided [[Active electronically scanned array|AESA radar]] with near 360-degree coverage, it could scan, map, track, and classify targets, and do all of these tasks near simultaneously; it was reportedly sensitive enough to pick up a formation of people moving over open terrain.&lt;ref name="foxtrot14april14"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/exclusive-p-8-poseidon-flies-with-shadowy-radar-system-1562912667|title=Exclusive: P-8 Poseidon Flies With Shadowy Radar System Attached|website=Foxtrot Alpha|first=Tyler|last=Rogoway|date=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Building upon the LSRS, the AAS also has a double-sided AESA radar, which contains a [[Moving target indication|moving target indicator]] (MTI) that can detect, classify, and track targets on land and at sea at the same time, with [[synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) and [[inverse synthetic aperture radar]] (ISAR) for picture-like radar imagery of both inland and ocean areas at the same time; these can profile vessels from a long distance and generate fine resolution without relying on optical sensors, especially in day or night and in adverse weather conditions. Once it detects and classifies a hostile vessel, the P-8 can send targeting information to another armed platform and guide a networked weapon (e.g. [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk cruise missiles]], [[AGM-84H/K SLAM-ER|SLAM-ER]], [[AGM-158 JASSM|JASSM]], [[AGM-158C LRASM|LRASM]], [[GBU-53/B|SDB II]]) to it through a [[data link]]. The AAS is in ways superior to the [[AN/APG-76#AN/APY-7|AN/APY-7]] used on the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]'s [[Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS|E-8 Joint STARS]], looking both port and starboard rather than just being side-looking. Other potential missions could include detecting and tracking low flying and stealthy [[cruise missile]]s, communications relaying, and [[electronic warfare]] as a standoff platform to penetrate contested airspace, since AESA radars are capable of radar jamming, producing fake targets, frying electronic components, and even [[cyberwarfare]].&lt;ref name="foxtrot14april14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defense-update.com/20140417_boeing-p-8a-begins-advanced-airborne-sensor-testing.html#.VfXzUDeFOM8|title=Boeing P-8A Begins Advanced Airborne Sensor Testing|website=Defense Update|first=Tamir|last=Eshel|date=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique involves the low angle incidence of flux material on vicinal substrates. Vicinal [[Thin-film|substrates]] are composed of atomic terraces separated by atomic steps. The ATLAS technique allows for the fabrication of well defined planar arrays of [[plasmon]]ic [[nanostructure]]s, of dimensions unachievable by [[lithography]].

A [[collimation|collimated]] beam of [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s is evaporated at an [[Angle#Types of angles|oblique]] angle to the substrate. This causes the steps to "shadow" the beam, and the molecules to be adsorbed only on the exposed parts of the steps in direct [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] of the [[Knudsen cell|evaporator]].

The principal attraction of the technique is its relative simplicity, as it does not involve multiple [[lithography]] steps and can be applied to [[metal]], [[semiconductor]] or [[oxide]] surfaces alike.

The technique is a "[[Nanotechnology#Bottom-up approaches|bottom-up]]" approach and allows great control over the separation of nanostructures within the array, as well as their individual widths.  The separation is controlled by the size of the atomic terraces of the substrate, which is determined by its miscut from the principal [[Miller index#The crystallographic planes and directions|index]]; and the width of the nanostructures is controlled by the oblique angle of the deposition.

'''''ATLAS''''' has been shown to be a very versatile technique, with the growth of [[metal]]lic, [[semi-conductor|semi-conducting]] and [[magnet]]ic nanowires and nanodots demonstrated using a variety of source materials and substrates.&lt;ref name="nanolett"&gt;Floriano Cuccureddu, Shane Murphy, Igor V. Shvets, Mauro Porcu, H. W. Zandbergen, ''Plasmon Resonance in Silver Nanoparticles Arrays Grown by Atomic Terrace Low-Angle Shadowing'', '''Nano Lett.''', 2008, 8 (10), pp 3248–3256, [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl801600w]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic Principles ==

[[File:ATLAS-Technique-Schematic1.png|thumb|alt=Schematic showing both "downhill" and "uphill" deposition models used in ATLAS|Figure 1. Deposition at a shallow angle on a vicinal surface (a) deposition of nanostructures on the outer step edges; beam at an angle ''β'' along the "downhill" direction, (b) substrate is rotated by 180° and the beam is directed in the "uphill" direction.]]

Figure 1(a) shows a schematic of the deposition in the "downhill" direction, that is, from an outer step edge to a lower terrace.  The deposition angle ''β'' between the beam and surface is small (1°-3°) so that some areas of the terraces are exposed to the beam, and others are [[shadow|geometrically shadowed]].

The deposition angle ''β'' determines the width of the nanostructures, according to the following relation:

:&lt;math&gt; w \approx a \left( \frac{1}{\alpha} - \frac{1}{\alpha + \beta} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''w'' is the nanostructure width, ''a'' is the height of one step, ''α'' is the miscut angle and ''β'' is the deposition angle between the incident beam and the surface (''α'' and ''β'' are assumed to be small and are measured in radians).

Figure 1(b) shows a similar situation, but this time with the substrate rotated by 180° so that the incident beam is now in the "uphill" direction, and nearly parallel to the surface.  In this case, the step faces provide the bonding sites and the deposited material grows along the steps, similar to the [[Pulsed laser deposition#Nucleation and growth of the film on the substrate surface|step-flow growth]] mechanism.

In order to grow nanowires with a width of fifteen [[nanometer]]s or less, the deposition [[temperature]] for both orientations should be chosen such that the [[mean free path]] of the [[adatom]]s on the surface is limited to a few nanometers.

== Experimental Development ==
The ATLAS system was developed within the [http://www.tcd.ie/Physics/applied-physics/ Applied Physics Group] at the School of [[Physics]], [[Trinity College, Dublin]].  The experimental procedure is relatively straightforward, when compared to [[lithography]] or other approaches, meaning that only standard equipment is needed.

The set-up consists of an [[ultra high vacuum|ultrahigh vacuum]] chamber (base pressure in the low 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; [[Torr]] range), with the sample mounted at a large working distance (40-100 [[centimetre|cm]]) from the evaporation source.  This large distance provides the high [[collimation]] required for the ATLAS technique.  The sample itself is mounted on a rotation stage and can be tilted through 200° with a precision of ±0.5°.

The substrate can be heated during deposition by either passing [[direct current]] through the sample for [[semiconductor]]s or by driving current through a separate heating foil underneath the substrate for [[insulator (electricity)|insulating]] [[oxide]]s.

== Versatility ==
&lt;!--image of results [[File:ATLASresults.png|thumb|Caption]]--&gt;
The capabilities of the system were first tested by growing arrays of 10-30&amp;nbsp;nm wide metallic nanowires on two types of vicinal substrates, [[step-bunching|step-bunched]] [[Silicon|Si]]([[Miller index#Definition|111]]) and [[Sapphire|α-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]([[Miller index#Case of hexagonal and rhombohedral structures|0001]]).  Deposition of [[gold|Au]] and [[silver|Ag]] onto these substrates yields arrays of wires with a width and height of 15&amp;nbsp;nm and 2&amp;nbsp;nm, and separated by approximately 30&amp;nbsp;nm.

Since its introduction in 2008, ATLAS has been demonstrated as a simple technique to produce nanowires of a variety of materials down to a width of 15&amp;nbsp;nm and thickness of 2&amp;nbsp;nm, on several stepped substrates.
&lt;!--different nanowire materials, substrates--&gt;

== Limitations ==
Although ATLAS is a versatile technique, some limitations do exist.  The initial growth of the nanowires is [[nucleation|nucleated]] on certain preferential [[adsorption]] sites.  This can form [[epitaxial]] seeds, which grow independently of each other, until they meet, which forms an overall [[polycrystalline]] wire.  This polycrystallinity can affect the stability of the wire when exposed to air, and can increase the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] due to its [[Crystallographic defect|defective]] nature.  It is an ongoing topic of research to increase the epitaxiality of nanowires by [[lattice matching]], or increasing initial mobility through heating of the substrate.

Despite these limitations, ATLAS's results of a 15&amp;nbsp;nm width is approximately a five-fold reduction in size compared to other shallow-angle techniques.&lt;ref name="old"&gt;J. Oster, M. Kallmayer, L. Wiehl, H. J. Elmers, H. Adrian, F. Porrati, M. Huth, '''J. Appl. Phys.''' 97, 014303 (2005), [https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.1825629]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5950">'''Construction communication''', within an organizational context, is to convey an instruction to influence the actions/behaviors of others, or may involve an [[Exchange (organized market)|exchange]] of, or request for [[information]] during a [[construction]] [[project]].&lt;ref name=Dainty&gt;Dainty, Andrew Dainty; Moore, David; Murray, Michael. (20 January 2006). ''Communication in Construction Theory and Practice.'' Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-32723-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[Communication]] usually involves the transfer of [[information]], a generic term that embraces meaning such as [[knowledge]], processed [[data]], [[skills]] and [[technology]].&lt;ref&gt;
Cheng, E., H. Li, P. Love, and Z. Irani. 2001. Network communication in the construction
industry. Within [[construction]], information is exceptionally diverse given the huge number of parties involved with the construction [[Business operations|operations]] [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=858013 Corporate Communication], 61–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication within project-based environments presents special challenges. This is especially true within the [[construction industry]], where [[interaction]] tends to be characterised by unfamiliar groups of people coming together for short periods before disbanding to work on other endeavours.&lt;ref name=Dainty/&gt;

== Importance ==
Per M.E.L. Hoezen, the author of ''The problem of communication in construction.''
&lt;blockquote&gt;The efficiency and effectiveness of the construction process strongly depend on the quality of
communication. In literature four reasons are mentioned why improvements in communication are
needed. The first reason is that an improvement in the communication within the building team, in project teams and between project manager and contractors, could reduce failure. Second, more open communication at all levels could lead to innovations and better technical solutions. Third, communication improvements in early phases of projects would positively influence the quality as perceived by all stakeholders involved. Finally, improved communication during the briefing might lead to better decision making, for example less haste in moving to solutions and better ways of looking at the requirements first.&lt;ref&gt;Hoezen, M.E.L. [http://doc.utwente.nl/58078/1/06_Hoezen.pdf The Problem of Communication in Construction.] University of Twente. Retrieved 23 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Communication is essential to all [[business]] activities; it enables an [[organization]], and is an integral part of the [[construction]] process. Beyond the argument, any improvement in communication can improve an organization's operating [[effectiveness]]. Good communication within an organization and between organizations contributing to the construction project can improve [[motivation]] levels and improve the processes. Conversely, inadequate communication can result in a [[work motivation|demotivated]] [[workforce]] and lead to problems in construction.&lt;ref name=Emmitt&gt;Emmitt, Stephen; Gorse, Christopher A. (2003). ''Construction communication.'' Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|1-4051-0002-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction projects are [[Building|complex]] and [[risky]], requiring the active [[participation (ownership)|participation]] of all contributors. [[Co-operation]] and [[Collaboration|co-ordination]] of activities through [[interpersonal]] and [[Group behavior|group communication]] are essential in ensuring the project is completed successfully. Poor communication, lack of consultation and inadequate [[feedback]] are to be found as the root cause of defects in many constructed works. Poor co-ordination and communication of design information lead to design problems that cause design errors. Communication is the one aspect of the [[management]] of projects that pervades all others.&lt;ref name=Emmitt/&gt;

Given that construction is such a fragmented, dynamic and disparate sector, the challenges of communicating effectively are greater than in most other production [[environment (systems)|environment]]s. Contractually driven relationships, [[conflict (process)|conflict]] and a lack of mutual [[respect]] and [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], all combine to hinder open communication and render the role of the project manager extremely demanding and problematic. Nevertheless, addressing communication in the [[industry]] can be seen as a principal enabler for improving the industry in the future.

== Issues ==
Since the early 1940s, literature on communication in construction has appeared, mainly based on the situation in the UK.&lt;ref name=Emmitt/&gt;

Many problems concerning communication have been reported, with a focus on intra-supplier communication within the construction sector; demand-supply communication during the design phase; and communication between and within single demand and supply side parties, during whole the construction process.&lt;ref name=Emmitt/&gt;

With the globalization of the construction industry, emerging issues in construction communication in international contexts, such as problem-solving in international projects, have started to receive more attention.&lt;ref name=Handford&gt;Handford Michael and Petr Matous (2011) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889490610000669 Lexicogrammar in the international construction industry: A corpus-based case study of Japanese-Hong-Kongese on-site interactions in English], ''English for Specific Purposes'', Volume 30, Issue 2, Pages 87-100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Handford2&gt;Handford Michael and Petr Matous (2015) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889490614000817 Problem-solving discourse on an international construction site: Patterns and practices] ''English for Specific Purposes'', Volume 18,  Pages 85–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RL-10 rocket engine.jpg|thumb|300px|[[RL-10]] is an early example of cryogenic rocket engine.]]

A '''cryogenic rocket engine''' is a [[rocket engine]] that uses a [[cryogenic fuel]] or [[oxidizer]], that is, its fuel or oxidizer (or both) are gases liquefied and stored at very low temperatures.&lt;ref name="saturn"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bilstein, Roger E.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, these engines were one of the main factors of [[NASA]]'s success in reaching the Moon by the [[Saturn V]] rocket.&lt;ref name="saturn"/&gt;

During [[World War II]], when powerful rocket engines were first considered by the German, American and Soviet engineers independently, all discovered that rocket engines need high [[mass flow rate]] of both oxidizer and fuel to generate a sufficient thrust. At that time oxygen and low molecular weight hydrocarbons were used as oxidizer and fuel pair. At room temperature and pressure, both are in gaseous state. Hypothetically, if propellants had been stored as pressurized gases, the size and mass of fuel tanks themselves would severely decrease rocket efficiency. Therefore, to get the required mass flow rate, the only option was to cool the propellants down to [[cryogenic]] temperatures (below −183&amp;nbsp;°C [90 K], −253&amp;nbsp;°C [20 K]), converting them to [[liquid]] form. Hence, all cryogenic rocket engines are also, by definition, either [[Liquid-propellant rocket|liquid-propellant rocket engines]] or [[hybrid rocket engine]]s.&lt;ref name="isbn0-470-08024-8"&gt;{{cite book

Various cryogenic fuel-oxidizer combinations have been tried, but the combination of liquid hydrogen ([[LH2]]) fuel and the liquid oxygen ([[LOX]]) oxidizer is one of the most widely used.&lt;ref name="saturn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The liquefaction temperature of oxygen is 89 [[kelvin]]s and at this temperature it has a density of 1.14&amp;nbsp;kg/l, and for hydrogen it is 20 kelvins, just above [[absolute zero]], and has a density of 0.07&amp;nbsp;kg/l.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both components are easily and cheaply available,  and when burned have one of the highest [[enthalpy]] releases by combustion,&lt;ref name="isbn0-7923-5813-9"&gt;{{cite book|author=Biswas, S.

==Construction==

The major components of a cryogenic rocket engine are the [[combustion chamber]] (thrust chamber), [[pyrotechnic initiator]], fuel injector, fuel [[cryopump]]s, oxidizer cryopumps, [[gas turbine]], cryo valves, regulators, the fuel tanks, and [[rocket engine nozzle]]. In terms of feeding propellants to the combustion chamber, cryogenic rocket engines (or, generally, all liquid-propellant engines) are either [[Pressure-fed engine (rocket)|pressure-fed]] or [[Pump-fed engine|pump-fed]], and pump-fed engines work in either a [[gas-generator cycle (rocket)|gas-generator cycle]], a [[Staged combustion cycle (rocket)|staged-combustion cycle]], or an [[expander cycle]].

The cryopumps are always [[turbopump]]s powered by a flow of fuel through gas turbines. Looking through this aspect, engines can be differentiated into a main flow or a bypass flow configuration. In the main flow design, all the pumped fuel is fed through the gas turbines, and in the end injected to the combustion chamber. In the bypass configuration, the fuel flow is split; the main part goes directly to the combustion chamber to generate thrust, while only a small amount of the fuel goes to the turbine.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Biography==

===Early life===
Derbyshire was born in [[Coventry]], daughter of Emma (née Dawson) and Edward Derbyshire.&lt;ref name="Brennan"&gt;Breege Brennan, Master's Thesis in Computer Music, Dublin, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; of Cedars Avenue, Coundon, Coventry.&lt;ref name=MorseCodeMusician&gt;Christine Edge, ''[http://delia-derbyshire.net/Morse%20code%20musician Morse code musician: How Delia crashed the sound barrier]'', ''Sunday Mirror'', 12 April 1970, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a sheet-metal worker.&lt;ref name="Dial a tune"&gt;Article by Kisten Cubitt "Dial a tune" in The Guardian newspaper, 3 September 1970&lt;/ref&gt; She had one sibling, a sister, who died young.&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt; Her father died in 1965 and her mother in 1994.&lt;ref name="About Delia"/&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], immediately after the [[Coventry Blitz]] in 1940, she was moved to [[Preston, Lancashire]] for safety. Her parents had moved from there originally&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt; and most of her surviving relatives still live in the area.&lt;ref name="About Delia"/&gt; She was very bright and, by the age of four, was teaching others in her class to read and write in primary school,&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt; but said "The radio was my education".&lt;ref name=Cavenagh1998&gt;Delia Derbyshire in conversation with John Cavanagh, 4 October 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents bought her a piano when she was eight years old. Educated at [[Barr's Hill Grammar School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barrshill.coventry.sch.uk/index.php/general-news-newsmenu-37/392-did-you-know |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604033717/http://www.barrshill.coventry.sch.uk/index.php/general-news-newsmenu-37/392-did-you-know |archivedate=4 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 1948 to 1956, she was accepted at both [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], "quite something for a working class girl in the 'fifties, where only one in 10 [students] were female",&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt; winning a scholarship to study mathematics at [[Girton College, Cambridge]] but, apart from some success in the mathematical theory of electricity, she claims she did badly.&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt; After one year at Cambridge she switched to music, graduating in 1959 with a BA in mathematics and music, having specialised in medieval and modern music history.&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt; Her other principal qualification was [[LRAM]] in pianoforte.&lt;ref name="About Delia"&gt;{{cite web|last=Blackburn|first=Clive|title=About Delia|url=http://www.cblackburn.fslife.co.uk/about_delia.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911230845/http://www.cblackburn.fslife.co.uk/about_delia.htm|archivedate=11 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She approached the careers office at the university and told them she was interested in "sound, music and acoustics, to which they recommended a career in either deaf aids or depth sounding".&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt; Then she applied for a position at [[Decca Records]], only to be told that the company did not employ women in their recording studios.&lt;ref name="Scotsman Article"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mansfield|first=Susan|title=Variations on the Dr Who theme|publisher=[[The Scotsman]]|date=25 September 2004|url=http://news.scotsman.com/doctorwho/Variations-on-the-Dr-Who.2567025.jp|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Surface&gt;Interview with Delia Derbyshire, conducted by Sonic Boom and published in ''Surface Magazine'' (May 2000).
&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, she took positions at the UN in Geneva,&lt;ref name="Guardian Obit"/&gt; from June to September, teaching piano to the children of the British Consul-General and mathematics to the children of Canadian and South American diplomats.&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt; Then from September to December, she worked as an assistant to Gerald G. Gross,&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt; Head of Plenipotentiary and General Administrative Radio Conferences at the [[International Telecommunication Union|International Telecommunications Union]]. She returned to [[Coventry]] and from January to April 1960 taught general subjects in a primary school there. Then she went to London where from May to October she was an assistant in the promotion department of music publishers [[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]].&lt;ref name="About Delia"/&gt;

===BBC Radiophonic Workshop===
In November 1960, she joined the BBC as a trainee assistant studio manager&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt; and worked on ''Record Review'', a magazine programme where critics reviewed classical music recordings. She said: "Some people thought I had a kind of second sight. One of the music critics would say, "I don't know where it is, but it's where the trombones come in" and I'd hold it up to the light and see the trombones and put the needle down exactly where it was. And they thought it was magic."&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt; She then heard about the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop|Radiophonic Workshop]] and decided that was where she wanted to work. This was received with some puzzlement by the heads in Central Programme Operation because people were usually "assigned" to the Radiophonic Workshop. But in April 1962 she was indeed assigned there&lt;ref name="About Delia"/&gt; in [[Maida Vale]], where for eleven years she would create music and sound for almost 200 radio and television programmes.&lt;ref name="CMJ obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/computer_music_journal/v025/25.4news.pdf|title=obituary| work=[[Computer Music Journal]], Vol 25, No. 4, Winter 2001, p.13|publisher=[[MIT Press]]/[[Project MUSE]]|accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1962 she assisted composer [[Luciano Berio]] at a two-week [[Dartington International Summer School|summer school]] at [[Dartington Hall]], for which she borrowed several dozen items of equipment from the BBC.&lt;ref name=Papers&gt;Delia Derbyshire's papers at Manchester University.&lt;/ref&gt; One of her first works, and the most widely known, was her 1963 electronic realization of a score by [[Ron Grainer]] for the [[Doctor Who theme music|theme tune of the ''Doctor Who'' series]],&lt;ref name="BBC28112016" /&gt; one of the first television themes to be created and produced by entirely electronic means.

{{Listen|filename=Doctor Who theme excerpt.ogg|title=Doctor Who theme excerpt|description=An excerpt from the theme music to ''Doctor Who''}}
When Grainer first heard it, he was so amazed by her rendering of his theme that he asked "Did I really write this?" to which Derbyshire replied "Most of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delia Derbyshire Electronic Music Pioneer|work=Official Delia Derbyshire website|url=http://www.delia-derbyshire.org|accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grainer attempted to get her a co-composer credit, but the attempt was prevented by the [[BBC]] bureaucracy, which then preferred to keep the members of the workshop anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ayres|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Ayres|title=Doctor Who—The Original Theme|work=A History of the Doctor Who Theme|url=http://markayres.rwsprojects.co.uk/DWTheme.htm#Original|quote=The story goes that on listening to playback, he enquired of Delia, "Did I write that?". To which she replied, "Most of it!".|accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would not be credited on-screen for her work until ''Doctor Who''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s 50th anniversary special, ''[[The Day of the Doctor]]''. Derbyshire's original arrangement served as Doctor Who's main theme for its first seventeen seasons, from 1963-80. The theme was reworked over the years, to her horror, and the version that had her "stamp of approval" is her original one.&lt;ref name="Delia Derbyshire Radio Scotland interview 1997"&gt;{{cite web|title=Delia Derbyshire Radio Scotland interview 1997|publisher=[[NME.com]]|url=http://www.nme.com/artists/delia-derbyshire|accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delia also composed some of the incidental music used in the show, including ''Blue Veils and Golden Sands'' and ''The Delian Mode''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/e71ca197-4808-4132-b1cc-0078d8066fee&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964–65 she collaborated with the British artist and playwright [[Barry Bermange]] for the BBC's [[Third Programme]] to produce four ''Inventions for Radio'', a collage of people describing their dreams, set to a background of electronic sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deacon|first=Nigel|title=Barry Bermange Plays|url=http://www.suttonelms.org.uk/BB.HTML|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guy|first=Martin|title=Delia Derbyshire – An audiological chronology|date=10 November 2007|url=http://delia-derbyshire.net/#TheDreams|accessdate=25 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unit Delta Plus===
In 1966, while still working at the BBC, Derbyshire with fellow Radiophonic Workshop member [[Brian Hodgson]] and [[Electronic Music Studios (London) Ltd|EMS]] founder [[Peter Zinovieff]] set up Unit Delta Plus,&lt;ref name="Guardian Obit"/&gt; an organisation which they intended to use to create and promote electronic music. Based in a studio in Zinovieff's townhouse at 49 Deodar Road in [[Putney]], they exhibited their music at a few experimental and electronic music festivals, including the 1966 ''The Million Volt Light and Sound Rave'' at which [[The Beatles]]' "[[Carnival of Light]]" had its only public playing.

In 1966, she recorded a demo with [[Anthony Newley]] entitled ''Moogies Bloogies'', although as Newley moved to the United States, the song was never released. After a troubled performance at the [[Royal College of Art]], in 1967, the unit disbanded.&lt;ref name="Unit Delta Plus"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unit Delta Plus|publisher=Delia-derbyshire.org|url=http://www.delia-derbyshire.org/unitdeltaplus.php|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late sixties, she again worked with Hodgson in setting up the Kaleidophon studio at 281–283 Camden High Street in [[Camden Town]] with fellow electronic musician [[David Vorhaus]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Obit"/&gt; The studio produced electronic music for various London theatres and in 1968 the three used it to produce their first album as the band [[White Noise (band)|White Noise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cuttingsarchive.org/index.php/Delia_Derbyshire_(1937-2001)|title=Delia Derbyshire (1937-2001) - The Doctor Who Cuttings Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their debut, ''[[An Electric Storm]]'', is now considered an important and influential album in the development of electronic music.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Derbyshire and Hodgson left the group subsequently, and future White Noise albums were solo Vorhaus projects.

The trio, using pseudonyms, also contributed to the [[Standard Music Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{discogs release|id=435907|name=Standard Music Library ESL 1104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these recordings, including compositions by Derbyshire using the name "Li De la Russe" (from an anagram-esque use of the letters in "Delia" and a reference to her auburn hair) were later used on the seventies [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] science fiction rivals to ''Doctor Who'': ''[[The Tomorrow People]]''&lt;ref name="The Tomorrow People"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Tomorrow People – Themes and Incidentals|publisher=[[Trunk Records]]|url=http://www.trunkrecords.com/turntable/tomorrow_people.shtml|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Timeslip]]''.&lt;ref name="Timeslip"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Music of Timeslip|publisher=Timeslip.org.uk – The Official Timeslip Website|url=http://www.timeslip.org.uk/production/music.php|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, she assisted [[Guy Woolfenden]] with his electronic score for [[Peter Hall (theatre director)|Peter Hall's]] production of ''[[Macbeth]]'' with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]].&lt;ref name="Guardian Obit"/&gt; The two composers also contributed the music to Hall's film ''[[Work Is a Four-Letter Word]]'' (1968).&lt;ref name="IMDb page"&gt;{{IMDb name|0220262}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her other work during this period included taking part in a performance of electronic music at [[The Roundhouse]],&lt;ref name="Guardian Obit"/&gt; which also featured work by [[Paul McCartney]], the score for an [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]]-sponsored student fashion show&lt;ref name="Guardian Obit"/&gt; and the sounds for [[Anthony Roland]]'s award-winning film of Pamela Bone's photography, entitled ''Circle of Light''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Circle of Light|publisher=The Roland Collection of Films &amp; Videos on Art|url=http://www.roland-collection.com/rolandcollection/section/29/660.htm|accessdate=25 July 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914075457/http://www.roland-collection.com/rolandcollection/section/29/660.htm|archivedate=14 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She composed a score for [[Yoko Ono]]'s short film ''Wrapping Event'', but no known copy of the film with the soundtrack is known to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guy|first=Martin|title=Delia Derbyshire – An audiological chronology|date=10 November 2007|url=http://delia-derbyshire.net/#WrappingEvent|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, she left the BBC and worked a brief stint at Hodgson's Electrophon studio&lt;ref name="Guardian Obit"/&gt; during which time she contributed to the soundtrack to the film ''[[The Legend of Hell House]]''.&lt;ref name="IMDb page"/&gt;

The studios [[Electrophon]] and Kaleidophon were named after early [[electrical musical instrument]]s made by [[Jörg Mager]] in pre-war Germany.

In 1975 she stopped producing music. Her final works were two soundtracks for video pioneers [[Madelon Hooykaas]] and [[Elsa Stansfield]] on their short films ''Een Van Die Dagen ("One Of These Days")'' in 1973 and ''Overbruggen ("About Bridges")'' in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guy|first=Martin|title=Delia Derbyshire – An audiological chronology|date=10 November 2007|url=http://delia-derbyshire.net/#EenVanDieDagen|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===

After her music career, Derbyshire worked as a radio operator for the laying of a [[British Gas]] pipeline, in an art gallery and in a bookshop.&lt;ref name="Guardian Obit"/&gt; In late 1974 she married David Hunter&lt;ref name="bmd-marriage"&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=[[General Register Office for England and Wales]]|title=Register of Marriages|volume=Northumberland West 1|page=1761|date=Oct–Dec 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Haltwhistle in Northumberland, the labourer son of a miner&lt;ref name="MailOnSunday"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Fidelma|title=Mail on Sunday|publisher=[[Mail on Sunday]]|date=20 March 2005|url=http://delia-derbyshire.net/sites/mailonsunday.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to gain local acceptance; the relationship was brief and disastrous although she never divorced. She also frequented the gallery space of Chinese artist [[Li Yuan-chia]] at his stone farmhouse in Cumbria. In 1978 she returned to London&lt;ref name="About Delia"/&gt; and met Clive Blackburn. In January 1980 she bought a house in Northampton where, four months later, Blackburn joined her. He remained her partner for the rest of her life, though at one point they lived separately. According to Blackburn, "in private, she never stopped writing music either. She simply refused to compromise her integrity in any way. And ultimately, she couldn't cope. She just burnt herself out. An obsessive need for perfection destroyed her."&lt;ref name="MailOnSunday" /&gt;

In 2001 she returned to music, providing sounds used as source material by [[Pete Kember]] on ''Sychrondipity Machine (Taken from an Unfinished Dream)'', a 55-second track for the compilation ''Grain: A Compilation of 99 Short Tracks'', released by Dot Dot Dot Music in 2001. In the liner notes, she is credited with "liquid paper sounds generated using fourier synthesis of sound based on photo/pixel info (B2wav - bitmap to sound programme)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grain|url=http://dotdotdotmusic.com/fulltrack1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The track was released posthumously and dedicated to her. 

Derbyshire's later life was chaotic due to chronic alcoholism; she died of [[renal failure]], aged 64, in July 2001.&lt;ref name="Guardian Obit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonny Mugwump, "[http://thequietus.com/articles/00768-the-bbc-radiophonic-workshop-review The BBC Radiophonic Workshop]", The Quietus, 25 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archive==
After Derbyshire's death, 267 [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tapes]] and a box of a thousand papers were found in her attic. These were entrusted to [[Mark Ayres]] of the BBC and in 2007 were given on permanent loan to the [[University of Manchester]]. Almost all the tapes were digitised in 2007 by Louis Niebur and David Butler, but none of the music has been published due to copyright complications.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, A. "Delia Derbyshire: the lost tapes" in ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]'' 297 (November 2008), page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the University acquired Derbyshire's childhood collection of papers and artefacts from Andi Wolf. This collection is accessible at the [[John Rylands Library]] in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://archives.li.man.ac.uk/ead/html/gb133bdd-p1.shtml Juvenile Papers of Delia Derbyshire]" [[University of Manchester]].

==Dramatic and documentary portrayals==
In 2002, [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast a [[radio play]] entitled [[Doctor Who at the BBC: The Plays#Blue Veils and Golden Sands by Martyn Wade|''Blue Veils and Golden Sands'']] as part of its ''[[Afternoon Drama|Afternoon Play]]'' strand, telling the story of Derbyshire and her pioneering musical work.&lt;ref name="guard-review"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/dec/23/tvandradio.radio|title=Pick of the day|first=Harold|last=Jackson|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 December 2002|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play starred actress [[Sophie Thompson]] as Derbyshire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007jvh7|title=Blue Veils and Golden Sands|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was written by Martyn Wade.&lt;ref name="guard-review"/&gt;

In October 2004 the Tron Theatre, Glasgow hosted Standing Wave, a play written by Nicola McCartney, score by Pippa Murphy. This was produced by Reeling and Writhing, directed by Katherine Morley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/oct/12/theatre1|title=Standing Wave, Tron, Glasgow|last=Fisher|first=Mark|date=2004-10-12|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Canadian filmmaker [[Kara Blake]] released ''[[The Delian Mode]]'', a short documentary film about Derbyshire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtve.es/television/20111114/the-delian-mode/475329.shtml "The Delian Mode"]. [[RTVE]], November 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The film won the [[Genie Award]] for [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Short Documentary|Best Short Documentary Film]] in 2010. 

In 2013 the BBC showed a television [[docudrama]] depicting the creation and early days of ''Doctor Who'' in 1963, called ''[[An Adventure in Space and Time]]'', as part of the celebrations for the programme's fiftieth anniversary. Derbyshire appeared as a character in it, portrayed by actress Sarah Winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2013/02/delia-derbyshire-cast-in-adventure-in.html|title=Delia Derbyshire cast in An Adventure in Space and Time|first=Chuck|last=Foster|work=Doctor Who News|date=10 February 2013|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Episode 5 "Derbyshire" of the BBC children's science TV programme ''[[Absolute Genius with Dick &amp; Dom]]'' is an exploration of Derbyshire's creation of the ''Doctor Who'' theme recording using her techniques on equipment archived from the Radiophonic Workshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/cbbc/episode/b01qy0b5/Absolute_Genius_with_Dick_and_Dom_Derbyshire/|title=Derbyshire|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coventry-based theatre company Noctium Theatre produced a play named Hymns for Robots about Derbyshire's working life,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noctiumtheatre.com Noctium Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; which played at the 2018 Edinburgh Fringe festival.

[[File:Divestment growth en.svg|thumb|300px|As of 2017, 800 institutions possessing 6000 billion dollars divested from the [[fossil fuel]] industry.]]

'''Fossil fuel divestment''' or '''fossil fuel divestment and investment in climate solutions''' is the removal of investment assets including stocks, bonds, and investment funds from companies involved in extracting [[fossil fuels]], in an attempt to reduce [[Global warming|climate change]] by tackling its ultimate causes.

Numerous groups advocate fossil fuel [[divestment]], which in 2015 was reportedly the fastest growing divestment movement in history.&lt;ref name=Guardian2015/&gt;  Beginning on campuses in The United States in 2010 with students urging their administrations to turn investments in the fossil fuel industry into investments in clean energy and communities most impacted by climate change, the movement soon spread across the globe. By December 2016, a total of 688 institutions and over 58,000 individuals representing $5.5 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]] in assets worldwide had been divested from fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Divestment Commitments|url=http://gofossilfree.org/commitments/|website=Gofossilfree.org|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carrington/&gt;

==Motivations for divestment==

===Reducing carbon emissions===
Fossil fuel divestment aims to reduce carbon emissions by accelerating the adoption of renewable energy through the stigmatisation of fossil fuel companies. This includes putting public pressure on companies that are currently involved in fossil fuel extraction to invest in renewable energy.

The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] found that all future carbon dioxide emissions must be less than 1,000 gigatonnes to provide a 66% chance of [[avoiding dangerous climate change]]; this figure includes all sources of carbon emissions. To avoid dangerous climate change, only 33% of known extractable fossil fuel of known reserves can be used; this carbon budget can also be depleted by an increase in other carbon emission sources such as deforestation and cement production. It is claimed that, if other carbon emissions increase significantly, then only 10% of the fossil fuel reserves can be used to stay within projected safe limits.&lt;ref name="How much of the world's fossil fuel can we burn?"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Duncan|title=How much of the world's fossil fuel can we burn?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/keep-it-in-the-ground-blog/2015/mar/25/what-numbers-tell-about-how-much-fossil-fuel-reserves-cant-burn|website=theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency, Earth's average temperature has risen by 1.4'''°'''F over the past century, and is predicted to rise another 2'''°''' to 11.5'''°''' over the next hundred years with continued carbon emission rates. This rise in temperature would far pass the level of warming that scientists have deemed safe to support life on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/climatechange/climate-change-basic-information|title=Climate Change: Basic Information|last=EPA,OAR,OAP,CCD|first=US|website=epa.gov|language=en|access-date=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting on the Paris Agreement: The Toronto Principle===
{{Reduced pull quote|1=right

Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2{{nnbsp}}°C  and{{nbsp}}...

The ''Toronto Principle'' is a fossil fuel divestment strategy, which puts into action the aims set forth at the [[Paris Agreement]] in 2015. It was first coined by Benjamin A. Franta, in an [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/8/franta-divestment-toronto-principle/ article] in the [[The Harvard Crimson|Harvard Crimson]], as a reference to the [[University of Toronto]]’s fossil fuel divestment process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/2/8/franta-divestment-toronto-principle/|title=On Divestment, Adopt the Toronto Principle|last=Franta|first=Benjamin A.|date=8 February 2016|work=Harvard Crimson|access-date=5 March 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[350.org]] submitted a petition for divestment on 6 March 2014, President Gertler established an ''ad hoc'' Advisory Committee on Divestment from Fossil Fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/to350/pages/50/attachments/original/1428958642/fossil-fuel-divest-new.pdf?1428958642|title=The Fossil Fuel Industry and the Case for Divestment|last=|first=|date=10 April 2015|website=Toronto350.org|publisher=The Asquith Press at the Toronto Reference Library|access-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, the Committee released a [http://www.president.utoronto.ca/secure-content/uploads/2015/12/Report-of-the-Advisory-Committee-on-Divestment-from-Fossil-Fuels-December-2015.pdf report] with several recommendations. Foremost, they argued that "targeted and principled divestment from companies in the fossil fuels industry that meet certain criteria...should be an important part of the University of Toronto’s response to the challenges of climate change."&lt;ref name=utoronto&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.utoronto.ca/secure-content/uploads/2015/12/Report-of-the-Advisory-Committee-on-Divestment-from-Fossil-Fuels-December-2015.pdf|title=Report of the President’sAdvisory Committee on Divestment from Fossil Fuels|last=Karney|first=Brian et. al|date=15 December 2015|website=|publisher=University of Toronto|access-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the report went further, and allied itself with the Paris Agreement. It recommended that the university divest from companies that “blatantly disregard the international effort to limit the rise in average global temperatures to not more than one and a half degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages by 2050...These are fossil fuels companies whose actions are irreconcilable with achieving internationally agreed goals."&lt;ref name=utoronto/&gt;

Franta identified this response as the Toronto Principle, which, as he argues, "aligns rhetoric and action. It suggests that it is all institutions’ responsibility to give life to the Paris agreement. Harvard could adopt this Toronto principle, too, and the world would be better for it."&lt;ref name="Arabella2014" /&gt; Franta also identified how the Toronto Principle would be put into practice, which includes "moving investments away from coal companies and coal-fired power plants, companies seeking non-conventional or aggressive fossil fuel development (such as oil from the Arctic or tar sands), and possibly also companies that distort public policies or deceive the public on climate. At present, these activities are incompatible with the agreement in Paris."&lt;ref name="How much of the world's fossil fuel can we burn?" /&gt; In adhering to the Toronto Principle, Franta argues that leading institutions can use their status and power to meaningfully respond to the challenge of [[climate change]], and act based on the goals at the Paris Agreement.

Stranded assets, which are known in relation to fossil fuel companies as the [[carbon bubble]], occur when the reserves of fossil fuel companies are deemed environmentally unsustainable and so unusable and so must be written off. Currently the price of fossil fuels companies' shares is calculated under the assumption that all of the companies' fossil fuel reserves will be consumed, and so the true costs of [[carbon dioxide]] in intensifying [[global warming]] is not taken into account in a company's stock market [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]].&lt;ref name=MPcommittee&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/mar/06/carbon-bubble-threat-uk-economy-fossil-fuels-mps |title='Carbon bubble' poses serious threat to UK economy, MPs warn|last=Harvey|first=Fiona|publisher= The Guardian|date=6 March 2014|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a study by [[HSBC]] found that between 40% and 60% of the market value of [[BP]], [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and other European fossil fuel companies could be wiped out because of stranded assets caused by carbon emission regulation.&lt;ref name="The Logic of Divestment: Why We Have to Kiss Off Big Carbon Now"/&gt; Bank of England governor [[Mark Carney]], speaking at the 2015 World Bank seminar, has stated: "The vast majority of reserves are unburnable" if global temperature rises are to be limited to below 2{{nnbsp}}°C.&lt;ref name="Mark Carney: most fossil fuel reserves can't be burned"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shankleman|first1=Jessica|title=Mark Carney: most fossil fuel reserves can't be burned|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/13/mark-carney-fossil-fuel-reserves-burned-carbon-bubble|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the [[International Energy Agency]] released an independent analysis on the effect of carbon emissions controls. This estimated that $300 billion in fossil-fuel investments would be stranded by 2035 if cuts in carbon emissions are adopted so that the global mean surface temperature increases by no more than 2{{nnbsp}}°C.&lt;ref name=IEA2014&gt;{{cite web|title=World Energy Investment Outlook – Special Report|url=http://www.worldenergyoutlook.org/investment/|publisher=International Energy Agency|accessdate=30 March 2015|page=43|date=3 June 2014}} The report estimated that about $120 billion of new fossil-fuel capacity in the power sector would be idled before repaying its investment costs, along with about $130 billion of stranded exploration costs for oil and about $50 billion for gas.&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the Carbon Tracker Initiative found that between 2010 and 2015 the [[Coal mining in the United States|US coal]] sector had lost 76% of its value including the closure of 200 mines. It found that [[Peabody Energy]], the world's largest private coal mining company, had lost 80% of its share price over this time. This was attributed to [[Environmental Protection Agency]] regulations and competition from [[shale gas]].&lt;ref name="US coal sector in 'structural decline', financial analysts say"&gt;{{cite web|title=US coal sector in 'structural decline', financial analysts say|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/24/us-coal-sector-in-terminal-decline-financial-analysts-say|website=theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, fossil fuel companies invested $670{{nbsp}}billion in exploration of new oil and gas resources.&lt;ref name="Leave fossil fuels buried to prevent climate change, study urges"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carrington|first1=Damian|title=Leave fossil fuels buried to prevent climate change, study urges|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/07/much-worlds-fossil-fuel-reserve-must-stay-buried-prevent-climate-change-study-says|website=theguardian.com|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Risk of regulation and carbon pricing====
A 2015 report studied 20 fossil fuel companies and found that, while highly profitable, the hidden economic cost to society was also large.&lt;ref name="hope-etal-2015"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  The report spans the period 2008–2012 and notes that: "for all companies and all years, the economic cost to society of their {{CO2}} emissions was greater than their after‐tax profit, with the single exception of [[ExxonMobil]] in 2008."&lt;ref name="hope-etal-2015"/&gt;{{rp|4}}  Pure coal companies fare even worse: "the economic cost to society exceeds total revenue (employment, taxes, supply purchases, and indirect employment) in all years, with this cost varying between nearly $2 and nearly $9 per $1 of revenue."&lt;ref name="hope-etal-2015"/&gt;{{rp|4,5}}  The paper suggests:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This hidden or externalised cost is an implicit subsidy and accordingly represents a risk to those companies.  There is a reasonable chance that society will act to either reduce this societal cost by regulating against fossil fuel use or recover it by imposing carbon prices. Investors are increasingly focused on this risk and seeking to understand and manage it."&lt;ref name="hope-etal-2015"/&gt;{{rp|2}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similarly, in 2014, financial analyst firm [[Kepler Chevreux|Kepler Cheuvreux]] projected $28 trillion in lost value for fossil fuel companies under a regulatory scenario that targets 450 parts per million of atmospheric {{CO2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/2014/28-trillion-11465|title=Fossil fuels face $30 trillion losses from climate, renewables|last=|first=|date=28 April 2014|work=Reneweconomy|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429075913/http://reneweconomy.com.au/2014/28-trillion-11465|archive-date=29 April 2014|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.keplercheuvreux.com/pdf/research/EG_EG_253208.pdf|title=Stranded assets, fossilised revenues|last=|first=|date=24 April 2014|work=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420071604/http://www.keplercheuvreux.com/pdf/research/EG_EG_253208.pdf|archive-date=20 April 2017|dead-url=|publisher=Kepler Cheuvreux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Competition from renewable energy sources====
Competition from renewable energy sources may lead to the loss of value of fossil fuel companies due to their inability to compete commercially with the renewable energy sources. In some cases this has already happened.&lt;ref name="Solar has won. Even if coal were free to burn, power stations couldn't compete"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parkinson|first1=Giles|title=Solar has won. Even if coal were free to burn, power stations couldn't compete|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/07/solar-has-won-even-if-coal-were-free-to-burn-power-stations-couldnt-compete|website=The Guardian|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deutsche Bank predicts that 80% of the global electricity market will have reached grid parity for solar electricity generation by the end of 2017.&lt;ref name="Solar at grid parity in most of world by 2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar at grid parity in most of world by 2017|url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/2015/solar-grid-parity-world-2017|website=reneweconomy.com.au/|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, 67% of the world's electricity generation was produced from fossil fuels.&lt;ref name="Breakdown of Electricity Generation by Energy Source"&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakdown of Electricity Generation by Energy Source|url=http://www.tsp-data-portal.org/Breakdown-of-Electricity-Generation-by-Energy-Source#tspQvChart|publisher=The Shift Project|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanwell Corporation, an electricity generator owned by the [[Government of Queensland]] made a loss in 2013 from its 4,000{{nbsp}}MW of coal and gas fired generation capacity. The company attributed this loss to the expansion of rooftop solar generation which reduced the price of electricity during the day; on some days the price (usually AUD$40–50/MWh) was almost zero.&lt;ref name="Solar has won. Even if coal were free to burn, power stations couldn't compete"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanwell blames solar for decline in fossil fuel baseload"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stanwell blames solar for decline in fossil fuel baseload|url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/2013/stanwell-blames-solar-for-decline-in-fossil-fuel-baseload-54543|website=reneweconomy.com.au|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian Government and Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecast the production of energy by rooftop solar to rise sixfold between 2014 and 2024.&lt;ref name="Solar has won. Even if coal were free to burn, power stations couldn't compete"/&gt;

====Unstable fossil fuel prices====
Unstable fossil fuel prices has made investment in fossil fuel extraction a more risky investment opportunity. [[West Texas Intermediate]] [[crude oil]] fell in value from $107 per barrel in June 2014 to $50 per barrel in January 2015. [[Goldman Sachs]] stated in January 2015 that, if oil were to stabilize at $70 per barrel, $1 trillion of planned oilfield investments would not be profitable.&lt;ref name="The Logic of Divestment: Why We Have to Kiss Off Big Carbon Now"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dickinson|first1=Tim|title=The Logic of Divestment: Why We Have to Kiss Off Big Carbon Now|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-logic-of-divestment-why-we-have-to-kiss-off-big-carbon-20150114|website=Rollingstone.com|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of divestment==
===Stigmatization of fossil fuel companies===
A study by the [[Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment]] at the [[University of Oxford]] found that the stigmatisation of fossil fuel companies caused by divestment can "materially increase the uncertainty surrounding the future cash flows of fossil-fuel companies."&lt;ref name=Ansar/&gt; That, in turn, "can lead to a permanent compression in the trading multiples&amp;nbsp;– e.g., the share price to earnings (P/E) ratio of a target company."&lt;ref name=Ansar/&gt;

The study also says that:
{{Block quote|The outcome of the stigmatisation process poses the most far-reaching threat to fossil fuel companies. Any direct impacts pale in comparison.&lt;ref name=Ansar&gt;Atif Ansar, Ben Caldecott and James Tilbury, [ "Stranded assets and the fossil fuel divestment campaign: what does divestment mean for the valuation of fossil fuel assets?"], [[University of Oxford]], 11 March 2015 (page visited on 20 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Economic risks of divestment from fossil fuels==
According to a 2013 study by the Aperio Group, the economic risks of disinvestment from fossil fuel companies in the [[Russell 3000 Index]] are "statistically irrelevant".&lt;ref name="Do the Investment Math: Building a Carbon-Free Portfolio"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geddes|first1=Patrick|title=Do the Investment Math: Building a Carbon-Free Portfolio

==Legal cases==
In November 2014, a group of seven undergraduate, graduate, and law students filed a lawsuit at the [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]] Superior Court against the president and fellows of Harvard College and others for "mismanagement of charitable funds" and "intentional investment in abnormally dangerous activities" in relation to Harvard's investments in fossil-fuel companies.&lt;ref&gt;John Schwartz, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/us/harvard-students-move-fossil-fuel-divestment-fight-to-court.html Harvard Students Move Fossil Fuel Stock Fight to Court], ''New York Times'' (19 November 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, the superior court granted Harvard's motion to dismiss. The superior judge wrote: "Plaintiffs have brought their advocacy, fervent and articulate and admirable as it is, to a forum that cannot grant the relief they seek."&lt;ref name="Klein "&gt;Mariel A. Klein &amp; Theodore R. Delwiche, [http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/3/24/judge-dismisses-divestment-lawsuit/ Judge Dismisses Divestment Lawsuit], ''Harvard Crimson'' (24 March 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction from the fossil-fuel industry==
In October 2014, [[Exxon Mobil]] stated that the fossil-fuel divestment was "out of step with reality" and that "to not use fossil fuels is tantamount to not using energy at all, and that's not feasible."&lt;ref name="The Logic of Divestment: Why We Have to Kiss Off Big Carbon Now"/&gt;

In March 2014, John Felmy, the chief economist of the [[American Petroleum Institute]], stated that the movement to divest from fossil-fuel companies "truly disgusts me" and stated that academics and campaigners who support divestment are misinformed, uninformed or liars. Felmy particularly criticized the environmentalist and author [[Bill McKibben]].&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Quirmbach, [http://www.wpr.org/american-petroleum-institute-economist-efforts-divest-fossil-fuels-disgust-him American Petroleum Institute Economist: Efforts to Divest From Fossil Fuels 'Disgust' Him], [[Wisconsin Public Radio]] (4 March 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Coal Association]] has pointed out that divesting from the fossil fuel industry does not necessarily result in a reduction of demand for fossil fuels, rather it would result in environmentally conscious investors losing influence over the operation of those companies. In fact, coal has been the fastest growing energy source over the last decade and is an important raw material for steel and cement in developing countries.&lt;ref name = Sporton&gt;{{cite news

==Exponential growth into a global divestment movement==
From half a dozen college campuses in 2011, calling on their administrations to divest endowments from coal and other fossil fuels and invest in clean energy and "just [[Energy transition|transition]]" strategies to empower those most impacted by environmental degradation and climate change, the campaign had spread to an estimated 50 campuses in spring 2012.&lt;ref name=Arabella2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring the Global Fossil Fuel Divestment Movement, September 2015|url=http://www.arabellaadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Measuring-the-Growth-of-the-Divestment-Movement.pdf|publisher=Arabella Advisors|accessdate=27 March 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323091725/http://www.arabellaadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Measuring-the-Growth-of-the-Divestment-Movement.pdf|archivedate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By September 2014, 181 institutions and 656 individuals had committed to divest over $50 billion.&lt;ref name=Arabella2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring the Global Fossil Fuel Divestment Movement, September 2014

==Groups involved in divestment campaigns==
===Fossil Free ANU===
[[File:Divestment activists with Bob Brown.jpg|thumb|Fossil Free ANU campaigners with [[Bob Brown]]]]
[[File:ANU Students Vote for Divestment.jpg|thumb|In October 2014, more than 82% of ANU students voted for full fossil fuel divestment]]

The divestment campaign at the [[Australian National University]] is one of the longest running in the world and, while it has not yet achieved full fossil fuel divestment, it has had substantial wins, most notably in 2011 and 2014.

Fossil Free ANU formed out of the ANU Environment Collective (EC), a consensus-based and non-hierarchical group of students affiliated with the [[Australian Student Environment Network]], when students were notified in 2011 by campaigners at the [[Northern Rivers|Northern Rivers, NSW]] that ANU was the 12th largest shareholders in the [[coal seam gas]] company Metgasco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = About Us|url = http://www.anuenviro.org/values/|website = ANU Enviro Collective|access-date = 1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following student protests, including an event called 'ANU Gets Fracked' that saw students erect a mock gas rig in Union Court, the ANU Council announced in October 2013 that it would divest from Metgasco, citing student concerns and the fact that the [[Australian Ethical Investment]] did not approve of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ANU to sell coal seam gas shares after student pressure|url = http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2011/10/13/3338652.htm|website = www.abc.net.au|access-date = 1 February 2016|language = en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Stayner, an activist from the EC, stated in the ANU student paper [[Woroni]] that: "He took some convincing, but the Vice Chancellor is showing leadership on this urgent issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ANU Removes Itself From Coal Seam Gas Operations {{!}} Woroni|url = http://dev.woroni.com.au/articles/news/anu-removes-itself-coal-seam-gas-operations|website = dev.woroni.com.au|access-date = 1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, student concerns were again raised in 2012 when it was revealed that the ANU had only reduced its holding in Metgasco from over 4 million shares in 2011 to 2.5 million in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Metgasco Our Dirty Secret|url = http://www.woroni.com.au/news/metgasco-our-dirty-secret/|website = Woroni|access-date = 1 February 2016|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Tom Swann filed a FOI request to the ANU requesting all "documents created during 2012, which refer to the University's purchase, sale or ownership of shares in any company which generates revenue from oil, coal, gas, or uranium."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ANU Investments in Fossil Fuels – a Freedom of Information request to Australian National University – Right To Know|url = https://www.righttoknow.org.au/request/anu_investments_in_fossil_fuels|website = www.righttoknow.org.au|access-date = 1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These documents revealed that ANU had substantial holdings in major fossil fuel companies and had been buying shares in Santos while selling shares in Metgasco.&lt;ref name=CanberraTimes&gt;{{cite web|title = ANU students lukewarm on 'gold standard' policy|url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/anu-students-lukewarm-on-gold-standard-policy-20131007-2v3e4.html|website = Canberra Times|access-date = 1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students lobbying and public pressure led the ANU Council to implement a Socially Responsible Investment Policy (SRI) in late 2013 modelled on Stanford University, which aims to "avoid investment opportunities considered to be likely to cause substantial social injury."&lt;ref name=CanberraTimes/&gt;

In 2014, students from Fossil Free ANU organised the first student-initiated referendum at the ANU and in elections in September more than 82 per cent of students voted in favour of the ANU divesting from fossil fuels in what was the highest turnout in a student election at the university in more than a decade.&lt;ref name=theage&gt;{{Cite news|title = Students put the Coalition on notice over climate change|url = http://www.theage.com.au/comment/students-put-the-coalition-on-notice-over-climate-change-20141022-119sn7.html|newspaper = The Age|date = 23 October 2014|access-date = 1 February 2016|first = Louis|last = Klee}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, the ANU Council announced that it would divest from seven companies, two of which, Santos and Oil Search, performed poorly in an independent review undertaken by the Centre for Australian Ethical Research.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{cite web|title = ANU sale of fossil fuel holdings not enough: students|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10-03/anu-selling-fossil-fuel-company-holdings-not-enough-student-says/5789748|website = ABC News|access-date = 1 February 2016|language = en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision provoked a month-long controversy with the ''[[Australian Financial Review]]'' publishing over 53 stories criticising the decision including 12 front pages attacking the ANU, with its editor-in-chief, Michael Stutchbury, prouncing the decision to be as "disingenuous" as banning the burqa.&lt;ref name=theage/&gt; These attacks, which ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' editorial described as "verging on hysterical"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ANU investment policy draws fire|url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/comment/ct-editorial/anu-investment-policy-draws-fire-20141007-10r8pu.html|website = Canberra Times|access-date = 1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was joined by members of the cabinet of the [[Abbott Government]], with the Treasurer [[Joe Hockey]] stating that the ANU Council is "removed from the reality of what is helping to drive the Australian economy and create more employment,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Coalition accused of ‘bullying’ ANU after criticism of fossil fuel divestment|url = https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/oct/13/coalition-accused-of-bullying-anu-after-criticism-of-fossil-fuel-divestment|newspaper = The Guardian|date = 12 October 2014|access-date = 1 February 2016|issn = 0261-3077|language = en-GB|first = Oliver|last = Milman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education Minister Christopher Pyne calling it "bizarre"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Pyne says ANU decision to ditch mining shares 'bizarre'|url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10-13/pyne-says-anu-decision-to-ditch-mining-companies-bizarre/5808674|website = ABC News|access-date = 1 February 2016|language = en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]] calling it "stupid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Tony Abbott attacks ANU's 'stupid decision' to dump fossil fuel investments|url = http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/tony-abbott-attacks-anus-stupid-decision-to-dump-fossil-fuel-investments-20141015-116a0y.html|website = The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date = 1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Louis Klee, an activist from Fossil Free ANU, wrote in ''The Age'' that the reaction demonstrated not just "the complicity of state power with the mining industry," but also &lt;blockquote&gt;that the citizens of this country are powerful voices in the debate over climate justice. It demonstrates that they are, ultimately, voices speaking with growing eloquence, urgency and authority for one thing: action to address global climate change.&lt;ref name=theage/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===350.org===
{{Main|350.org}}

350.org is an international [[environmental organization]] encouraging citizens to action with the belief that publicizing the increasing levels of carbon dioxide will pressure world leaders to address climate change and to reduce levels from 400 parts per million to 350 parts per million. As part of its global policy, 350.org launched their Go Fossil Free: Divest from Fossil Fuels! campaign in 2012, which campaign calls for colleges and universities, as well as cities, religious institutions, and pension funds to withdraw their investments from fossil fuel companies.

===Divest-Invest Philanthropy===

===Divest Harvard===
Divest Harvard is an organization at Harvard University that seeks to compel the university to divest from fossil fuel companies.

===Fossil Free MIT===
{{Primary sources|section about MIT|date=November 2016}}
Fossil Free MIT (FFMIT) is a student organization at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] made up of MIT undergrads, graduate students, post-docs, faculty, staff and alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fossilfreemit.org/who-we-are/ |title=About Us; Fossil Free MIT webpage |website=fossilfreemit.org |date= |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was formed in Fall 2012 by six MIT students following a visit to Boston by [[Bill McKibben]] of 350.org on his "Do the Math" tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fossilfreemit.org/history-of-ffmit-our-campaign/ |title=History of FFMIT and Our Campaign; Fossil Free MIT webpage |website=fossilfreemit.org |date= |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has collected over 3,500 signatures in a petition calling for MIT to (1) immediately freeze new investments in fossil fuel companies, and (2) divest within five years from current holdings in these companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fossilfreemit.org/the-petition/ |title=Sign the Petition!; Fossil Free MIT webpage |website=fossilfreemit.org |date= |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following discussions with FFMIT, the university administration initiated a "campus-wide conversation" on climate change to take place from November 2014 to May 2015, which included the formation of the MIT Climate Change Conversation Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/climateaction/ClimateActionPlanTimeline-2015Oct21.pdf/ |title=Timeline: Creation of MIT Plan for Action on Climate Change |website=climateaction.mit.edu |date=October 2015 |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee, composed of 13 faculty, staff, and students, was charged with engaging the MIT community to determine how the university could address climate change and with offering recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/vpr/climate/MIT_Climate_Change_Conversation_Report_2015.pdf |title=Report of the MIT Climate Change Conversation Committee: MIT and the Climate Challenge |website=climateaction.mit.edu |date=June 2015 |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conversation included solicitation of ideas and opinions of MIT community members, as well as a number of public events. The largest event was a fossil fuel divestment debate among six prominent voices on climate change that was attended by approximately 500 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/vpr/climate/MIT_Climate_Change_Conversation_Report_2015.pdf |title=Report of the MIT Climate Change Conversation Committee: MIT and the Climate Challenge |website=climateaction.mit.edu |date=June 2015 |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee released a report in June 2015, recommending a number of initiatives to be undertaken by the university. In regards to fossil fuel divestment, the committee "rejected the idea of blanket divestment from all fossil fuel companies"; although there was  "support by (three-quarter) majority of the committee for targeted divestment from companies whose operations are heavily focused on the exploration for and/or extraction of the fossil fuels that are least compatible with mitigating climate change, for example coal and tar sands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/vpr/climate/MIT_Climate_Change_Conversation_Report_2015.pdf |title=Report of the MIT Climate Change Conversation Committee: MIT and the Climate Challenge |website=climateaction.mit.edu |date=June 2015 |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the campus-wide conversation, on 21 October 2015, President [[L. Rafael Reif]] announced the MIT Plan for Action on Climate Change. While the plan enacted many of the committee’s recommendations, the university administration chose not to divest its holdings in fossil fuel companies, stating that "divestment...is incompatible with the strategy of engagement with industry to solve problems that is at the heart of today’s plan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/climateaction/ClimateChangeStatement-2015Oct21.pdf |title=A Plan for Action on Climate Change |website=climateaction.mit.edu |date=21 October 2015 |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, Fossil Free MIT began a sit-in outside the office of the President to protest the shortcomings of the plan, including the rejection of divestment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fossil Free MIT|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V135/N29/fossilfree.html |title=MIT’s Climate Plan doesn’t add up. So we’re sitting-in.; News; The Tech |website=http://tech.mit.edu/ |date=29 October 2015 |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100 people overall participated in the sit-in, which received coverage by multiple news outlets, including the [[Boston Globe]], [[Boston Magazine]], and the [[Daily Caller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fossilfreemit.org/news/ |title=In the News; Fossil Free MIT webpage |website=fossilfreemit.org |date= |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sit-in, which lasted 116 days, ended officially with an agreement with Vice President for Research [[Maria Zuber]] following negotiations about how to improve the Plan. The agreement did not include divestment, but succeeded in establishing a climate advisory committee and a climate ethics forum. In addition, the administration agreed to strengthen the university’s carbon mitigation commitments, striving for carbon neutrality "as soon as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vivian Zhong|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V136/N6/sitin.html |title=Fossil Free MIT ends sit-in after agreement; News; The Tech |website=http://tech.mit.edu/ |date=3 March 2015 |accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvard's decision not to divest was explained in an open letter from the University President, [[Drew Faust]]:

{{Quote|Divestment is likely to have negligible financial impact on the affected companies. And such a strategy would diminish the influence or voice we might have with this industry.

In November 2012, the board of trustees unanimously voted to divest the remainder of its fossil-fuel holdings (then about 3% of its portfolio) over the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unity.edu/news/unity-college-reports-no-loss-fossil-fuel-divestment Unity College Reports No Loss from Fossil Fuel Divestment] (press release), Unity College (1 May 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Unity"&gt;[http://www.unity.edu/about-unity/sustainability-science/fossil-fuel-divestment Divestment: Our Commitment to Fossil Fuel Divestment], Unity College.&lt;/ref&gt; The college completed divestment in 2014, three years ahead of schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Zahra Hirji &amp; Elizabeth Douglass, [http://insideclimatenews.org/news/20032015/map-tracking-academias-fossil-fuel-divestment Map: Tracking Academia's Fossil Fuel Divestment], ''Inside Climate News'' (20 March 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Unity College was the first institution of higher education in the United States to divest from fossil fuels.&lt;ref name="Unity"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diane Toomey, [http://e360.yale.edu/feature/interview_stephen_mulkey_how_a_small_college_launched_divestment_from_fossil_fuels/2773/ How A Small College Launched Divestment from Fossil Fuels], ''Environment 360'' (9 June 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[University of Dayton]] ([[Dayton, Ohio]], USA)&amp;nbsp;– In May 2014, the University of Dayton's board of trustees unanimously approved a plan to begin to divest the university's holdings from the top 200 fossil-fuel companies. At the time of the announcement, about 5% ($35 million) of the university's $670 million investment pool was held in such companies. UD became the first Catholic university in the U.S. to divest from fossil fuels. The plan was publicly announced in June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Stewart, [http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/ud-to-cut-coal-and-fossil-fuel-investments/ngRFD/ UD to cut coal and fossil fuel investments], ''Dayton Daily News'' (23 June 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.udayton.edu/news/articles/2014/06/dayton_divests_fossil_fuels.php Dayton Divests] (press release), University of Dayton (23 June 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The university planned to review its progress in 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Roewe, [http://ncronline.org/blogs/eco-catholic/university-dayton-divests-fossil-fuels University of Dayton divests from fossil fuels], ''National Catholic Reporter'' (24 June 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[University of Maine System]] ([[Maine]], USA)&amp;nbsp;– in January 2015, the board of trustees of the University of Maine System unanimously voted to divest from direct holdings in coal-mining companies. The system's total investments were about $589 million; the decision would affect $502,000 of direct investments in coal, which amounts to about 30% of the system's total ($1.7 million exposure to coal, including both direct and indirect investments). Some board members stated that they would continue to consider full system-wide divestment in the future. Separately, the [[University of Maine at Presque Isle]], one of seven schools within the system, announced that its own foundation had divested from all fossil-fuel investments.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Respaut, [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/01/27/maine-university-coal-idUSL1N0V62N320150127 University of Maine Board votes to divest from coal], Reuters (27 January 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[University of Massachusetts]] ([[Massachusetts]], USA)&amp;nbsp;– in December 2015, the board of trustees of the University of Massachusetts System announced their plans to divest from direct holdings in coal companies. Once this decision was released, the escalation of a four-year student-run campaign, the UMass Fossil Fuel Divestment Campaign, occurred. A 500 student week long occupation of the Whitmore Administration Building led to 34 student arrests and a decision to vote on fossil fuel divestment at the next Board of Trustees Meeting. On 25 May 2016 it was announced the University of Massachusetts system would divest its endowment from direct holdings in fossil fuels, becoming the first major public university to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.umass.edu/newsoffice/article/umass-becomes-first-major-public UMass Becomes First Major Public University to Divest from Direct Fossil Fuel Holdings] (25 May 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[General Synods of the United Church of Christ|2013 general synod]] of the [[United Church of Christ]] (UCC) passed a resolution (sponsored by the Massachusetts Conference and ten other conferences of the UCC) outlining a path to divestment of church funds from fossil-fuel holdings. Under the resolution, a plan for divestment will be developed by June 2018. The original proposal considered by the general synod called for a five-year plan to divestment; this was changed following negotiations between divestment proponents and the UCC's investment arm, United Church Funds.&lt;ref&gt;Micki Carter, [http://www.ucc.org/gs2013-fossil-fuel-divestment-vote United Church of Christ to become first U.S. denomination to move toward divestment from fossil fuel companies], United Church of Christ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Brandeis Raushenbus, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/02/fossil-fuel-divestment-ucc_n_3535729.html Fossil Fuel Divestment Strategy Passes at United Church of Christ Convention (UCC)], ''Huffington Post'' (2 July 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennel"&gt;Celeste Kennel-Shank.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31354">The '''French Restoration style''' was predominantly [[French Neoclassicism|Neoclassicism]], though it also showed the beginnings of [[romanticism]] in music and literature. The term describes the arts, architecture, and decorative arts of the [[Bourbon Restoration]] period (1814–1830), during the reign of [[Louis XVIII]] and [[Charles X of France|Charles X]]  from the fall of [[Napoleon]] to the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 and the beginning of the reign of [[Louis-Philippe]].

==Architecture and design==

===Public buildings and monuments===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
To commemorate the memory of [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]] and to expiate the crime of their execution,  King Louis XVIII built the [[Chapelle expiatoire]] by [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]] on the site of the small cemetery of the Madeleine, where their remains (now in the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]]) had been hastily buried following their execution. It was completed and dedicated in 1826.

The royal government restored the symbols of the old regime, but continued the construction of most of the monuments and urban projects begun by Napoleon. The church of [[La Madeleine, Paris|La Madeleine]], begun under Louis XVI, had been turned by Napoleon into the Temple of Glory (1807).  It was now turned back to its original purpose, as the Royal church of [[La Madeleine, Paris|La Madeleine]]. All of the public buildings and churches of the Restoration were built in a relentlessly [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style.  Work resumed, slowly, on the unfinished [[Arc de Triomphe]], begun by Napoleon.  At the end of the reign of Louis XVIII,  the government decided to transform it from a monument to the victories of Napoleon into a monument celebrating the victory of the Duke of Angôuleme over the Spanish revolutionaries who had overthrown their Bourbon king. A new inscription was planned: "To the Army of the Pyrenees"  but the inscription had not been carved and the work was still not finished when the regime was toppled in 1830. {{sfn|Héron de Villefosse|1958|page=313}}

The [[Canal Saint-Martin]] was finished in 1822, and the building of the [[Bourse de Paris]], or stock market, designed and begun by [[Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart]] from 1808 to 1813, was modified and completed by [[Éloi Labarre]] in 1826. New storehouses for grain near the Arsenal, new slaughterhouses, and new markets were finished. Three new suspension bridges were built over the Seine;  the Pont d'Archeveché,  the Pont des Invalides and footbridge of the Grève.  All three were rebuilt later in the century.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Several new churches were begun during the Restoration to replace those destroyed during the Revolution. A battle took place between architects who wanted a neogothic style, modeled after Notre-Dame, or the neoclassical style, modeled after the basilicas of ancient Rome. The battle was won by a majority of neoclassicists on the Commission of Public Buildings, who dominated until 1850. [[Jean Chalgrin]] had designed Saint-Philippe de Role before the Revolution in a neoclassical style; it was completed (1823–30) by [[Étienne-Hippolyte Godde]]. Godde also completed Chalgrin's project for Saint-Pierre-du-Gros-Caillou {1822–29), and built the neoclassic basilicas of Notre-Dame-du-Bonne Nouvelle ((1823–30) and Saint-Denys-du-Saint-Sacrament (1826–35). {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=84–85}}  Other notable neoclassical architects of the Restoration included [[Louis-Hippolyte Lebas]], who built [[Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, Paris|Notre-Dame-de-Lorette]] (1823–36); (1823–30); and [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]], who built the church of [[Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Paris|Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul]] (1824–44). Hittorff went on to along a brilliant career in the reigns of Louis Philippe and Napoleon III, designing the new plan of the Place de la Concorde and constructing the [[Gare du Nord]] railway station (1861–66). {{sfn|Sarmant|2012|page163}}

===Commercial architecture - the shopping gallery===
[[File:Galerie of the Palais Royal - interior, 1831.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Galerie d'Orleans at the [[Palais-Royal]] (1818–29), a shopping arcade covered with a glass roof, by [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]]]]
A new form of commercial architecture had appeared at the end of the 18th century; the passage, or shopping gallery, a row of shops along a narrow street covered by a glass roof. They were made possible by improved technologies of glass and cast iron, and were popular since few Paris streets had sidewalks and pedestrians had to compete with wagons, carts, animals and crowds of people.  The first indoor shopping gallery in Paris had opened at the [[Palais-Royal]] in 1786;  rows of shops, along with cafes and the first restaurants,  were located under the arcade around the garden.  It was followed by the passage Feydau in 1790–91,  the passage du Caire in 1799, and the [[Passage des Panoramas]] in 1800.{{sfn|Fierro|2003|page=36}}   In 1834 the architect [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]] carried the idea a step further, covering an entire courtyard of the Palais-Royal, the Galerie d'Orleans, with a glass skylight. The gallery remained covered until 1935.  It was the ancestor of the glass skylights of the Paris department stores of the later 19th century. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=70–71}}

===Residential architecture===
[[File:Square d'Orléans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|English neoclassical house in the [[Square d'Orleans]] (1829–35) by [[Edward Cresy]]]] 
During the Restoration, and particularly after the coronation of King [[Charles X]] in 1824. New residential neighborhoods were built on the Right Bank in Paris, as the city grew to the north and west. Between 1824 and 1826, a time of economic prosperity, the quarters of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Europe, Beaugrenelle and Passy were all laid out and construction began.  The width of lots grew larger; from six to eight meters wide for a single house to between twelve and twenty meters for a residential building. The typical new residential building was four to five stories high, with an attic roof sloping forty-five degrees, broken by five to seven windows. The decoration was largely adapted from that of the Rue de Rivoli;  horizontal rather than vertical orders, and simpler decoration. The windows were larger and occupied a larger portion of the façades. Decoration was provided by ornamental iron shutters and then wrought-iron balconies. Variations of this model were the standard on Paris boulevards until the Second Empire.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=74–75}}

The hôtel particular, or large private house of the Restoration, usually was built in a neoclassical style, based on Greek architecture or the style of [[Palladio]], particularly in the new residential quarters of Nouvelle Athenes and the Square d'Orleans on Rue Taibout (9th arrondissement), a private residential square (1829–35) in the English neoclassical style designed by Edward Cresy. Residents of the square included [[George Sand]] and [[Frédéric Chopin]]. Some of the houses in the new quarters in the 8th arrondissement, particularly the quarter of François I, begun in 1822,  were made in a more picturesque style, a combination of the Renaissance and classical style, called the ''Troubadour'' style. This marked the beginning of the movement away from uniform neoclassicism toward eclectic residential architecture.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=74–75}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The decorative style of the French Restoration borrowed from both the geometry of the neoclassical style era, and the overload of decoration of the Louis XIV style, along with the color of Renaissance. One of the best examples is the Charles X museum within the Louvre, a suite of rooms that was created for, among other purposes, the Salon of artists that was held there annually. The ceilings were divided into compartments filled with paintings and lavishly decorated with corniches, columns and pilasters. The neo-Gothic also began to appear in interior decoration during the 1820, particularly in the design of galleries and salons with arches and arched windows and rose windows modeled after those in gothic cathedrals.  Another feature of the French restoration was polychromy, the use of bright colors in the decorations, either with colored stone, glass, or paintings. Ceilings were particularly lavish, with hemicycles, cupolas, pendants, and vaults, often filled with decorative paintings. {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=182}}

Another good example of the French Restoration style of design is the interior of the [[Chapelle expiatoire]]. While the layout of the building and architecture is sober and perfectly Greco-Roman neoclassicism, the inside of the dome is decorated with rosettes, and there is an abundance of high-relief sculpted decoration in bands below the cornices and between the columns supporting the dome, including stylized Maltese crosses, fleur-de-lis and roses. The floor also has elaborate polychrome decoration in stone with the same motifs. {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=186}}

With the downfall of Napoleon, those aristocrats who had fled France during the Revolution began to return; they found their furniture had largely been confiscated and sold during the Revolution, and they had little money to buy lavish new furniture. The new King, Louis XVIII, liked the Empire style, so that style remained in place, with slightly rounded lines, and the removal of the Napoleonic symbols and ornaments,&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'', pg. 96-97&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Louis XVIII in 1824, the new King, his brother Charles X, allotted an indemnity to aristocrats whose belongings had been confiscated during the Revolution, and the luxury furniture industry began to revive. Interest began to develop in older styles, particularly Gothic and Renaissance, especially after the creation of a museum of French monuments during the Revolution, but the gothic revival movement did not become really strong until after the publication in 1831 of ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]] (1831).&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'', pg. 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;

Ornament of gilded bronze became rarer;  most ornament was marquetry inlay, either light wood into dark, or dark wood into light;  often in form of very elaborate floral designs, under the influence of the Duchesse de Berry. Under Charles X, the ''á la Cathédral'' or Cathedral chair became popular, with a back resembling the form of a Gothic stained glass window.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, (2006) pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt; The Gothic rose also became a popular decoration on furniture, along with stylized palmettes and other floral designs. Comfort was another consideration in the design of new chairs. The Voltaire armchair, with sabre-curved front legs, a high curving padded back and padded armrests, became popular.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, (2006) pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt; It took its name from a popular illustration of portrait of Voltaire, made about 1820, which showed him seated in s similar armchair.&lt;ref&gt;Storck, Justin, ''Le Dictionnaire pratique de menuiserie, ébénisterie, charpente,''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Restoration saw the beginning of the long battle between neoclassicism and romanticism in painting and other domains of art. [[Jacques-Louis David]], the dominant neoclassical painter during the reign of Napoleon, went into exile in Belgium;  however, other prominent students of David remained in Paris, and continued the style, simply changing the subject matter.  They included [[François Gérard]], who painted the coronation of King [[Charles X]] in 1827, following almost exactly the composition used by David in his coronation painting of the Emperor Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Toman, ''Neoclassicism et Romanticism'' (2007), page 377&lt;/ref&gt;  Other former pupils of David included [[Antoine-Jean Gros]] (1771-1835), and the most prominent of all, [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], (1780-1867), who painted his famous ''Grand Odalisque'' in the year that Napoleon first went into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Toman, ''Neoclassicism et Romanticism'' (2007), page 377&lt;/ref&gt;

The new generation of neoclassicists, led by Ingres and Gérard, largely ignored the idea of a classicism based on Ancient Roman and Greek values, and concentrated instead on the perfection of the depiction of human body, by its lines, composition and color.&lt;ref&gt;Toman, ''Neoclassicism et Romanticism'' (2007), page 382&lt;/ref&gt; During the Restoration, Ingres was commissioned to paint a mural for the ceiling of the Salle Clarac of the [[Louvre]], called ''Apothéose de Homer''.  Completed in 1827, it brought together all of the famous artists of history, attending the crowning of Homer by an angel.  Ingres also surpassed all of his contemporaries of the period as a portrait painter. In 1819 Ingres painted ''Roger rescuing Angelique'', inspired by St. George slaying a dragon, in an almost surrealistic setting.  Here Ingres' style foreshadowed the drama of [[Gustave Moreau]] Other painters who often followed the more delicate and sensual version of neoclassicism included [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]] (1758–1821), and the portraitist [[Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]].&lt;ref&gt;Toman, (2007), page 390–96&lt;/ref&gt;

An entirely different approach to painting was taken by [[Théodore Géricault|Jean Louis Théodore Géricault]]  with his painting ''The Raft of the Meduse'' (1818–1819), depicting the true story of the survivors of a shipwreck, gathered on a raft, appealing for help to a far distant ship. Géricault had meticulously studied anatomy to make the dead bodies on the raft more realistic. The painting was bitterly attacked by many critics and defended by many others, including the poet [[Baudelaire]] and the painter [[Horace Vernet]]. Géricault returned to the theme in 1821-24, with "The Tempest" or "The shipwreck" a painting of a corpse washed ashore on beach during storm. (1821–24), illustrating graphically again how humans were powerless against nature. In 1822–23, Gericault painted ''La Folle'', a portrait of a madwoman in a Paris asylum with a distant, hopeless stare. His school of painting became known a "theatrical romanticism".&lt;ref&gt;Toman, (2007), page 411-412&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugène Delacroix]] was another major painter of "theatrical romanticism" who emerged during the Restoration.  As a young painter, he was particularly impressed by the works of [[Rubens]] in the Louvre, by the drawings of [[Goya]], and the paintings of [[John Constable|Constable]].  After traveling to England, where he met Constable, he returned to Paris and became friends with [[Stendhal]], [[Balzac]] and [[Victor Hugo]]. At the Paris Salon of 1827, he showed nine paintings.  The following year, he presented ''The Death of Sardanapale''.  In the fall of 1830, shortly after the [[July Revolution]], which toppled King Charles X, he painted  ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'', which was presented at the 1831 Salon, and became one of the icons of French art.&lt;ref&gt;Toman, (2007), page 408-409&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The most prominent French sculptor of the Restoration was [[François Joseph Bosio]] (1768-1845).  Born in [[Monaco]], he received a scholarship from the Prince of Monaco to study in Paris, under [[Augustin Pajou]].  During the Empire of Napoleon, he sculpted some of the plaques on the column in [[Place Vendôme]], and made numerous portrait busts of the Emperor's family.  During the restoration, he became the royal sculptor to the King, and made both portrait busts and sculptors in the classical-romantic style.  He made the central statue Louis XVI for the Expiatory Chapel, called ''Apotheosis of Louis XVI'' or ''Louis XVI called to immortality, supported by an angel''. In 1828 he completed a new work of sculpture for the top of the [[Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]] at the Louvre.  A chariot and horse sculpture, taken by Napoleon from [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice, had originally been placed atop the arch, but it had been returned to Venice after Napoleon's downfall.  The Bourbons commissioned Bosio to make a new work, Peace guiding a Chariot, to commemorate the Bourbon Restoration. Bosio was also commissioned to replace the equestrian statue of Louis XIV which had been the centerpiece of [[Place des Victoires]], which had been destroyed during the Revolution. His new version, twelve meters high, was installed in 1828.

Another notable French sculptor of the period was Pierre Jean David 1788–1856), who called himself [[David d'Angers]], to distinguish himself from his teacher, Jacques Louis David. He worked in the studio of Jacques Louis David beginning in 1809. Then, between 1811 and 1816 he studied at the French Academy in Rome, where he became familiar with the works of [[Canova]], the great Italian master of romanticism. However, he turned his own work toward classicism, illustrating the patriotic and moral virtues. He made busts or statues of many notable statesmen, including the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Goethe]].  In 1830, he began working on his best-known work, the frieze over the entrance of the [[Panthéon|Pantheon]], titled ''The Country recognizes its great men'', which he completed in 1837. {{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=298}}

Another notable sculptor who began his career during the Restoration was [[François Rude]], (1784–1847), He moved to Paris from Dijon in 1805 to study with [[Pierre Cartellier]]. In 1811 he won the [[Prix de Rome]], but he was a confirmed Bonapartist, and after the downfall of Napoleon, he went into exile in Beligium, where he had success as a portrait sculptor. He did not return until 1827. Between 1833 and 1836, he made the celebrated sculptures, called ''Les Marseillaise'', which decorate the [[Arc de Triomphe]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Bourbon restoration saw the rise of [[romanticism]] to the position of the dominant movement in French literature. The earliest prominent romantic was [[François-René de Chateaubriand]], an essayist and diplomat. He began the Restoration as a committed defender of the Catholic faith and royalist, but gradually moved into the liberal opposition and became a fervent supporter of freedom of speech.  Other prominent romantic writers of the period included the poet and politician [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], [[Gérard de Nerval]], [[Alfred de Musset]], [[Théophile Gautier]], and [[Prosper Mérimée]].&lt;ref&gt;''Petit Larousse de l'histoire de France'' (2004), pages 361-364&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite limitations on press freedom, Paris editors published the first works of some of France's most famous writers. [[Honoré de Balzac]] moved to Paris in 1814, studied at the University of Paris, wrote his first play in 1820, and published his first novel, ''Les Chouans'', in 1829. [[Alexandre Dumas]] moved to Paris in 1822, and found a position working for the future King, Louis-Philippe, at the Palais-Royal. In 1829, At the age of 27, he published his first play, ''Henri III and his Courts''. [[Stendhal]], a pioneer of literary realism, published his first novel, ''[[The Red and the Black]]'', in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;''Petit Larousse de l'histoire de France'' (2004), pages 361-364&lt;/ref&gt;

The young [[Victor Hugo]] declared that he wanted to be "Chateaubriand or nothing". His first book of poems, published in 1822 when he was twenty years old, earned him a royal prize from Louis XVIII. His second book of poems in 1826 established him as one of France's leading poets. He wrote his first plays, ''Cromwell'' and ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'' in 1827 and 1830, and his first short novel, ''The Last Days of a Condemned Man'', in 1829. The premiere of the ultra-romantic play ''Hernani'' caused a riot in the audience, on the eve of the fall of the Bourbon Monarchy,&lt;ref&gt;''Petit Larousse de l'histoire de France'' (2004), pages 361-364&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The restoration of the monarchy with the coronation of Louis XVIII brought an end to the era of gigantic outdoor celebrations with patriotic music of the Revolution and the Empire of Napoleon. Instead, music returned to the salons of the old aristocracy, who returned from exile, and the new aristocracy created under Napoleon Bonaparte. The Music Conservatory in Paris was renamed the Royal School of Music, and the King commissioned the Italian-born [[Luigi Cherubini]], newly named music director of the chapel of the Tuileries Palace, to write a requiem mass for Louis XVI, as well as a coronation mass for himself. The composer [[Gaspare Spontini]] was named director of royal music. A royal institution of religious music was also established in 1825, to perform early masterpieces of French religious music by [[Clément Janequin]]  and [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], which had been banned during the Revolution and ignored under Napoleon I.{{Sfn|Vila|2007|page=126}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The composers most performed in the part of the period were the work of composers of the pre-revolutionary period, [[Gluck]], [[Sacchini]] and [[Spontini]], but new composers soon appeared, including [[Carl Maria von Weber]], who arrived from Germany, and staged a highly-successful French version of the first romantic German opera,  ''[[Der Freischütz]]'', or ''The Marksman'',  in 1824.{{Sfn|Vila|2007|page=126}}

The most successful musical theater of the period was the [[Théâtre-Italien]], which performed in the Salle Favert in Paris; it produced the a series of operas by the most famous composer of the period, [[Gioachino Rossini]], including ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' in 1819.  Rossini moved to Paris in 1824, and was named Director of Music and Staging at the Théâtre-Italien.  Only Italian works were presented, always in Italian.  Rossini became the most prominent figure of the Paris musical world, writing the music for the coronation of Charles X in 1824.

In 1820 a Bonapartist assassinated the Duke du Berry at the Paris opera house on rue de Richelieu. King Louis XVIII ordered the immediate closing, and then the demolition, of the Opera House. The Opera moved to the [[Salle Le Peletier]], where it remained for fifty years. This theater was the scene of the birth of the first French grand opera, and the first romantic opera, with the premier of ''La Muette de Portici'' by [[Daniel Auber|Auber]] in July 1829. The theme of this opera, the rebellion of the people of Naples against Spanish rule, was particularly romantic and revolutionary.  A performance of the opera in Brussels in 1830 led to riots, followed by a real revolution. [[Wagner]] attended a performance and wrote, "it was something entirely new; no one had seen a subject of an opera so current;  it was the first true musical drama in five acts entirely provided with all the elements of tragedy, and notable also for its tragic ending."{{Sfn|Vila|2007|page=126}}

The Paris opera continued to astonish its audiences with new musical and visual effects. For the opera ''The Last Days of Pompeii'' by [[Giovanni Pacini]], the opera employed the scientist and inventor [[Louis Daguerre]] to create optical illusions on a screen simulating dancing flames and the waves of the sea.{{Sfn|Vila|2007|page=126}}

To satisfy the demands of Paris opera-goers for truly grand opera, Rossini was commissioned to write the [[Le siège de Corinthe]] and then ''[[William Tell (opera)|William Tell]]''.  This last work, which premiered at the Pelletier opera house on August 3, 1829, despite its famed overture, disappointed the critics, who criticized its excessive length, weak story, and lack of action.  The criticism stung Rossini, and, at the age of thirty-seven, he retired from writing operas.{{Sfn|Vila|2007|page=133}}

The musical salons of the aristocracy had a working-class counterpart in Paris during the Restoration;  the ''[[goguette]]'', musical clubs formed by Paris workers, craftsmen, and employees. There were ''goguettes'' of both men and women.  They usually met once a week, often in the back room of a cabaret, where they would enthusiastically sing popular, comic, and sentimental songs. During the Restoration, songs were also an important form of political expression. The poet and songwriter [[Pierre-Jean de Béranger]] became famous for his songs ridiculing the aristocracy, the established church and the ultra-conservative parliament. He was imprisoned twice for his songs, in 1821 and 1828, which only added to his fame. His supporters around France sent ''[[foie gras]]'', fine cheeses and wines to him in prison. The celebrated Paris police chief [[Eugène François Vidocq]] sent his men to infiltrate the ''goguettes'' and arrest those who sang songs ridiculing the monarch.{{Sfn|Vila|2007|page=128}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5939">'''Gannet''' is an oil and gas field located in the United Kingdom’s Central [[North Sea]]. It is 180 km east of [[Aberdeen]] Scotland, and the water depth at the Gannet offshore installation is 95 metres (312 ft).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shell.co.uk/content/dam/royaldutchshell/documents/lubricants/gannet-2014-complex-021799-asset-fact-sheets-marketing.pdf|title=Gannet complex Fact Sheet - Shell (2015)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is located in Blocks 22/21, 22/25, 22/26 and 21/30. It is half-owned by [[Royal Dutch Shell]] (50%) and partly by [[ExxonMobil]] (50%) and has been operated by Shell UK Ltd since ‘first oil’ in November 1993. The Gannet A installation is the host platform for [[Subsea (technology)|subsea]] tiebacks designated Gannet B to G. Like most Shell fields in the central and northern North Sea the field is named after a sea bird the [[gannet]].

== The Gannet reservoirs ==
The Gannet reservoirs are located at a depth of between 1768 m and 2728 m and extend over several blocks. They comprises good quality turbiditic sands of a [[Tertiary|Tertiary age]] (Tay, Rogaland, [[Forties Oil Field|Forties]], Lista and Andrew Formations) and were discovered in 1973. The formation comprises a mixture of hydrocarbon reservoirs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/gannet/|title=Offshore Technology - Gannet Oil and Gas Field Project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
The topsides for Gannet were designed by [[Amec Foster Wheeler|Matthew Hall Engineering]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Matthew Hall Engineering publicity brochure undated but c. 1990&lt;/ref&gt; which was also responsible for procurement and construction and commissioning assistance. They were awarded the contract in July 1989.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Initially there were facilities for 15 oil production wells, two gas production wells and seven spare slots; there was also provision for 39 subsea risers. The production capacity was 56,000 [[Barrel (unit)|barrels]] of oil per day and 4.0 million standard cubic metres of gas per day. There are four production trains for both oil and gas processing. Electricity generation is powered by two 21 MW [[Rolls-Royce RB211|Rolls Royce RB-211]] gas turbines. The topside accommodation was for 40 people. The integrated deck topsides (9600 tonnes) are supported by a four leg steel jacket (lift weight 8400 tonnes).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The topsides were fabricated by Redpath Offshore North; and the jacket by RGC Offshore at [[Methil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abarrelfull.wikidot.com/gannet-oil-and-gas-field|title=A Barrel Full - Gannet Oil and Gas Field (2013)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
Oil from the platform wellheads and subsea wells is routed to one of the three horizontal first stage 3-phase separators.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Process Overall Flow Scheme, undated &lt;/ref&gt; Oil from the separators is combined and fed to common second, third and fourth stage 3-phase separators. Processed oil is exported by pipeline to the [[Fulmar Oil Field|Fulmar]] A installation and thence via [[Norpipe]] to [[Teesside]]. Gas from the second, third and fourth stage separators is compressed to the operating pressure of the first stage separators with which it is combined and further compressed. Gas from the Gannet A gas wellheads and from the Gannet B &amp;C subsea wells flows to one of the two vertical separators. Gas is co-mingled with the off-gas from the oil separators is dehydrated through counter-current contact with [[Triethylene glycol]]. Gas is compressed for export to [[St Fergus Gas Terminal|St Fergus]] via the Fulmar gas pipeline. There are also facilities for gas injection into Gannet A, B &amp; C reservoirs and for gas lift to oil production wells on reservoirs, A, C, D, E, F and G. [[Produced water]] is treated prior to overboard disposal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Oil export capacity is 88,000 barrels per day. Gas compression and dehydration capacity is 246 million standard cubic feet per day. Gannet A has a gas lift capacity of 130 million standard cubic feet per day and a produced water handling capability of 60,000 [[Barrel (unit)|barrels]] per day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Shell have indicated that there is greater than 25% ullage of the total system capability available in the plant for additional third party processing and transportation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1291">The '''Gap Analysis Program''' is a nationwide program in the [[United States]] to assess and support the overall conservation status of wildlife.  The program is directed and coordinated under the [[United States Geological Survey]], but is implemented in coordination with state and regional programs. 

GAP works to ensure that common species – those that are not officially endangered – remain common by identifying those species and plant communities that are not adequately represented in existing conservation lands. 

The GAP program began in the 1980s, based on analysis of [[Hawaii]]an [[bird]] species by [[J. Michael Scott]].

GAP has produced national land cover and protected areas datasets, which it uses to assess the conservation status of mammal, bird, reptile, and amphibian species in the U.S.

A GAP program normally has three principal components:
1. Landcover analysis
2. Vertebrate species distribution prediction
3. Land stewardship database

Each component is normally performed as a [[GIS]] layer.

'''''Gossypium''''' is a [[genus]] of [[flowering plant]]s in the tribe [[Gossypieae]] of the [[Malva|mallow]] family, [[Malvaceae]] from which [[cotton]] is harvested. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the [[Old World|Old]] and [[New World]]s. There are about 50 ''Gossypium'' species,&lt;ref name=wendel1&gt;Jonathan F. Wendel, Curt Brubaker, Ines Alvarez, Richard Cronn and James McD. Stewart. 2009. Evolution and Natural History of the Cotton Genus. In Andrew H. Paterson (Ed.). Genetics and Genomics of Cotton. Plant Genetics and Genomics: Crops and Models, 2009, Volume 3, 3–22.&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest genus in the tribe Gossypieae and new species continue to be discovered.&lt;ref name=wendel1/&gt; The name of the genus is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''goz'', which refers to a soft substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NJ6PyhVuecwC |title=The Names of Plants |first=D. |last=Gledhill |edition=4 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-86645-3 |year=2008 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotton is the primary natural fibre used by modern [[human]]s. Where cotton is cultivated it is a major oilseed crop and a main protein source for animal feed. Cotton is thus of great importance for agriculture, industry and trade, especially for tropical and subtropical countries in Africa, South America and Asia. Consequently, the genus ''Gossypium'' has long attracted the attention of scientists.

The origin of the genus ''Gossypium'' is dated to around 5–10 million years ago.&lt;ref name=senchina&gt;David S. Senchina, Ines Alvarez, Richard C. Cronn, Bao Liu, Junkang Rong, Richard D. Noyes, Andrew H. Paterson, Rod A. Wing, Thea A. Wilkins and Jonathan F. Wendel.  2003.  Rate Variation Among Nuclear Genes and the Age of Polyploidy in Gossypium.  Mol. Biol. Evol. 20(4):633–643.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gossypium'' species are distributed in arid to semiarid regions of the tropics and subtropics. Generally shrubs or shrub-like plants, the species of this genus are extraordinarily diverse in morphology and adaptation, ranging from fire-adapted, herbaceous perennials in Australia to trees in Mexico.&lt;ref name=wendel1/&gt;

Cultivated cottons are perennial shrubs most often grown as annuals. Plants are 1–2 m high in modern cropping systems, sometimes higher in traditional, multiannual cropping systems, now largely disappearing. The leaves are broad and lobed, with three to five (or rarely seven) lobes. The seeds are contained in a [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]] called a "boll", each seed surrounded by fibres of two types. These fibres are the more commercially interesting part of the plant and they are separated from the seed by a process called [[ginning]]. At the first ginning, the longer fibres, called staples, are removed and these are twisted together to form yarn for making thread and weaving into high quality textiles. At the second ginning, the shorter fibres, called "linters", are removed, and these are woven into lower quality textiles (which include the eponymous [[Lint (material)|Lint]]). Commercial species of cotton plant are ''[[Gossypium hirsutum|G. hirsutum]]'' (&gt;90% of world production), ''[[Gossypium barbadense|G. barbadense]]'' (3–4%), ''[[Gossypium arboreum|G. arboreum]]'' and ''[[Gossypium herbaceum|G. herbaceum]]'' (together, 2%). Many varieties of cotton have been developed by selective breeding and hybridization of these species.  Experiments are ongoing to cross-breed various desirable traits of wild cotton species into the principal commercial species, such as resistance to insects and diseases, and drought tolerance. Cotton fibres occur naturally in colours of white, brown, green, and some mixing of these.

Most wild cottons are [[ploidy|diploid]], but a group of five species from America and Pacific islands are tetraploid, apparently due to a single hybridization event around 1.5 to 2 million years ago.&lt;ref name=senchina/&gt;  The tetraploid species are ''[[Gossypium hirsutum|G. hirsutum]]'', ''[[Gossypium tomentosum|G. tomentosum]]'', ''[[Gossypium mustelinum|G. mustelinum]]'', ''[[Gossypium barbadense|G. barbadense]]'', and ''[[Gossypium darwinii|G. darwinii]]''.

==''Gossypium'' genome==
{{Technical|section=Gossypium genome|date=January 2011}}
A public genome sequencing effort of cotton was initiated &lt;ref&gt;Z. Jeffrey Chen, Brian E. Scheffler, Elizabeth Dennis, Barbara A. Triplett, Tianzhen Zhang, Wangzhen Guo, Xiaoya Chen, David M. Stelly, Pablo D. Rabinowicz, Christopher D. Town, Tony Arioli,  Curt Brubaker, Roy G. Cantrell, Jean-Marc Lacape, Mauricio Ulloa, Peng Chee, Alan R. Gingle, Candace H. Haigler, Richard Percy, Sukumar Saha, Thea Wilkins and Robert J. Wright, Allen Van Deynze, Yuxian Zhu, Shuxun Yu, Ibrokhim Abdurakhmonov, Ishwarappa Katageri, P. Ananda Kumar, Mehboob-ur-Rahman, Yusuf Zafar, John Z. Yu, Russell J. Kohel, Jonathan F. Wendel, Andrew H. Paterson.  2007.  Toward Sequencing Cotton (Gossypium) Genomes. Plant Physiology, December 2007, Vol. 145, pp. 1303–1310. http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/145/4/1303&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 by a consortium of public researchers. They agreed on a strategy to sequence the genome of cultivated, [[allotetraploidy|allotetraploid]] cotton. "Allotetraploid" means that the genomes of these cotton species comprise two distinct subgenomes, referred to as the At and Dt (the 't' for tetraploid, to distinguish them from the A and D genomes of the related diploid species). The strategy is to sequence first the D-genome relative of allotetraploid cottons, ''G. raimondii'', a wild South American ([[Peru]], [[Ecuador]]) cotton species, because of its smaller size due essentially to less repetitive DNA (retrotransposons mainly). It has nearly one-third the number of bases of tetraploid cotton (AD), and each chromosome is only present once.{{Clarify|date=January 2011}} The A genome of ''G. arboreum'', the 'Old-World' cotton species (grown in [[India]] in particular), would be sequenced next. Its genome is roughly twice the size of ''G. raimondii'''s. Once both A and D genome sequences are assembled, then research could begin to sequence the actual genomes of tetraploid cultivated cotton varieties.  This strategy is out of necessity; if one were to sequence the tetraploid genome without model diploid genomes, the euchromatic DNA sequences of the AD genomes would co-assemble and the repetitive elements of AD genomes would assembly independently into A and D sequences, respectively.  Then there would be no way to untangle the mess of AD sequences without comparing them to their diploid counterparts.

The public sector effort continues with the goal to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources.  The public-sector effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids, as well as 454 reads.  These later types of reads will be instrumental in assembling an initial draft of the D genome.  In 2010, two companies ([[Monsanto]] and [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]]), completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of ''G. raimondii'' about 50x.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Monsanto and Illumina Reach Key Milestone in Cotton Genome Sequencing|url = http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/monsanto-illumina-key-milestone-cotton-genome-sequencing.aspx|website = www.monsanto.com|access-date = 2016-01-31|last = APPDMZ\gyoung|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160201042838/http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/monsanto-illumina-key-milestone-cotton-genome-sequencing.aspx|archivedate = 2016-02-01|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They announced they would donate their raw reads to the public. This public relations effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the cotton genome. Once the D genome is assembled from all of this raw material, it will undoubtedly assist in the assembly of the AD genomes of cultivated varieties of cotton, but a lot of hard work remains.

A '''hot link''' also referred to as a "red link" is a type of sausage often associated with the [[cuisine of the Southern United States]], featured commonly as a part of [[Barbecue in the United States|American barbecue]], [[soul food]], and [[Cajun cuisine|Cajun]]&lt;ref name="Billock 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tutwiler 2010"/&gt; and [[Louisiana Creole cuisine|Louisiana Creole]] cuisines. It is sometimes referred to as a "Louisiana hot link".&lt;ref name="Kidd 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cutlip 2014"/&gt; It is also a part of [[Texan cuisine]]&lt;ref name="Stern Stern 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blow 1983"/&gt; and the [[Culture of Chicago#Food and drink|cuisine of Chicago]], Illinois. The hot link is usually prepared using pork, beef, or a combination of both. It is sometimes used as an ingredient in other dishes, such as [[jambalaya]] and [[gumbo]].&lt;ref name="Claiborne Edge Milam 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodgers Williams Caruso 2001"/&gt; Hot link sausages are [[mass production|mass-produced]] by some companies in the United States.&lt;ref name="Blow 1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ray Bhunia 2013"/&gt;

==Preparation==
Pork or beef, or a blend of both,&lt;ref name="Mitchell 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cicero 2015"/&gt; is typically used as the primary meat ingredient.&lt;ref name="Stern Stern 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Devine Dikeman 2014"/&gt; The hot link can be spiced using red pepper flakes and cayenne pepper.&lt;ref name="Cutlip 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Devine Dikeman 2014"/&gt; Additional spices may be used, such as thyme, paprika, crushed bay leaves and onion flakes.&lt;ref name="Cutlip 2014"/&gt; Hot link sausages are sometimes [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]].&lt;ref name="Mitchell 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meyer 2016"/&gt;

==By location==
===Louisiana===
In Southern Louisiana, where [[Cajun cuisine]] is abundant, a hot link sausage on a bun is consumed more frequently than hot dogs.&lt;ref name="Tutwiler 2010"/&gt;

===Texas===
In Texas, the hot link is typically prepared with [[beef]],&lt;ref name="Blow 1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stern &amp; Stern 2011-2nd source"/&gt; and is usually cooked over indirect heat.&lt;ref name="Stern &amp; Stern 2011-2nd source"/&gt; Common sides to accompany the Texas hot link includes sliced white bread, crackers, orange cheese, onion slices and pickles.&lt;ref name="Blow 1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stern &amp; Stern 2011-2nd source"/&gt; In [[Pittsburg, Texas]], the hot link is a popular food and has been produced there since 1897.&lt;ref name="Blow 1983"/&gt; In Pittsburg, hot links are typically broiled or baked to the point of having a "half-burned look".&lt;ref name="Blow 1983"/&gt; In 1983, Pittsburg Hot Link Packers, Inc. in Pittsburg, Texas was producing 12,000 pounds of hot links per week.&lt;ref name="Blow 1983"/&gt; Almost all of the hot links produced by Pittsburg Hot Link Packers were consumed within 100 miles of Pittsburg during this time.&lt;ref name="Blow 1983"/&gt;

===Illinois===
In Chicago, Illinois, hot links are typically prepared using [[pork]], may be spiced with pepper, fennel and sage, and are typically covered with a barbecue sauce.&lt;ref name="Stern &amp; Stern 2011-2nd source"/&gt; They are commonly available at [[soul food]] barbecue restaurants in the city's south side,&lt;ref name="Stern &amp; Stern 2011-2nd source"/&gt; often served with french fries and white bread.&lt;ref name="Stern &amp; Stern 2011-2nd source"/&gt; They may be slow cooked in a [[barbecue pit]].&lt;ref name="Stern &amp; Stern 2011-2nd source"/&gt;

'''''How It's Made''''' ('''''Comment c'est fait''''' in Quebec) is a documentary [[television program|television series]] that premiered on January 6, 2001, on the [[Discovery Channel (Canada)|Discovery Channel]] in Canada, and [[Science (TV channel)|Science]] in the United States. The program is produced in the Canadian province of [[Quebec]] by Productions MAJ, Inc. and Productions MAJ 2.&lt;ref&gt;3959015 Canada, Inc.{{full|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The show is a [[documentary film|documentary]] showing how common, everyday items (including clothing and accessories like alligator handbags, foodstuffs like [[bubble gum]], industrial products such as [[engine]]s, musical instruments such as [[guitar]]s, and sporting goods such as [[snowboard]]s) are manufactured.

''How It's Made'' is filmed without explanatory text to simplify overdubbing in different languages. For example, the show currently avoids showing a narrator or onscreen host, does not often have employees of featured companies speak on camera, and keeps human interaction with the manufacturing process to a bare minimum.

An off-screen narrator explains each process, often with humorous [[pun]]s. Each half-hour show usually has three or four main segments, with each product getting a demonstration of approximately five minutes; exceptions are allowed in the allotted time for more complex products. Usually, every show has at least one product with a historic background note preceding it, showing how and where the product originated, and what people used before it.

In April 2007, all episodes run in the United States (on the [[Discovery Channel]] and [[Science (TV channel)|Science]]) had the individual season openings replaced with a new opening used for every episode. Similar to most other Discovery Channel shows, the credits now run during the last segment, with only a blue screen and the request for feedback (and the website) at the end.

In September 2007, the ninth season began airing on Science, along with new openings, graphics, and soundtracks, and Zac Fine replaced Brooks T. Moore as the narrator. However, the eleventh season, which started airing in September 2008, reinstated Moore as the narrator and reverted to a previous title sequence and soundtrack.

In June 2008, the Science Channel added ''How It's Made: Remix,'' which consists of previous segments arranged into theme installments like "Food", "Sporting Goods", and such. In 2013, the Science Channel added ''How It's Made: Dream Cars'', which focused exclusively on high-performance and exotic cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = How It's Made: Dream Cars |url = http://science.discovery.com/tv-shows/how-its-made/videos/dream-cars.htm |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130618132310/http://science.discovery.com/tv-shows/how-its-made/videos/dream-cars.htm |publisher = [[Science (TV channel)|Science]] |archive-date = June 18, 2013 |deadurl = yes |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were later shown on the [[Velocity (TV channel)|Velocity]] channel.

==Hosts==
Canadian hosts have included [[Mark Tewksbury]] (season 1, 2001), Lynn Herzeg (seasons 2–4, 2002–2004), June Wallack (season 5, 2005) and Lynne Adams (season 6 onwards, 2006–present).

A different voice-over track is recorded for US audiences by [[Brooks Moore]] (seasons 1–8, 2001–2007, 2008–present) and Zac Fine (2007–2008). The scripts are almost identical but the main difference in the US versions are that the units of measurement are given in [[United States customary units]] instead of [[metric system|metric units]]. At one point in the US run, a subtitled conversion was shown on-screen over the original narration.

In the United Kingdom, the rest of Europe, and in some cases in Southeast Asia, the series is narrated by [[Tony Hirst]].

The '''Independent Production Fund''' (IPF) is a Canadian private independent foundation that supports the production of Canadian dramatic digital media entertainment content and television series. It also provides professional development services and training to digital media producers and creators, in English and in French. See also [[:fr:Fonds_indépendant_de_production|Fonds indépendant de production]] entry (in French).

== History ==
In 1990 [[Maclean Hunter Limited]], a former Canadian communications company, created the Maclean Hunter Television Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maclean Hunter Television Fund 5th Anniversary: A Boost To Canadian Television|url=http://playbackonline.ca/1996/06/03/5354-19960603/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with a capital endowment of $29.2 M restricted in perpetuity, as a result of a Decision by the [[Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications  Commission]] (CRTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Decision CRTC 89-766|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1989/DB89-766.HTM}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Fund was incorporated federally as a corporation without share capital and was granted [[charitable organization|charitable status]].  Its mandate was to fund television drama series and undertake industry training with the interest generated by the endowment and return on investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adilman|first1=Sid|title=Where's The TV Drama?|publisher=Toronto Star|date=May 17, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fund mandate was extended to undertake the administration of other independent private funds supporting the Canadian film, television and digital media industry:  the Cogeco Program Development Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cogeco Fund: About|url=http://cogecofund.ca/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  launched in 1993, the Bell Fund  (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Digital Content Grants and Co-Production Support Underscore Bell Fund Vision|url=http://onscreenmanitoba.com/new-digital-content-grants-and-co-production-support-underscore-bell-fund-vision-and-2014/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a series of other short-term industry Funds.

In 1994 Maclean Hunter was acquired by [[Rogers Communications]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Rogers Communications Inc.|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/45/Rogers-Communications-Inc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Fund was renamed the Independent Production Fund.   A five-member board of directors representing different sectors of the production industry governed the Fund’s activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independent Production Fund Guide to Web Series Best Practices|url=http://onscreenmanitoba.com/independent-production-fund-guide-to-web-series-best-practices/|website=OnScreen Manitoba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the CRTC approved the IPF as a "Canadian Independent Production Fund"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRTC: List of Certified Independent Production Funds|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/GENERAL/CIPFund.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  eligible to receive contributions from [[Broadcast Distribution Undertaking]]s (BDU's). In 2017, Cogeco Communications directed its annual Broadcast Distribution Undertaking (BDU) contributions to the IPF to establish the Cogeco TV Production Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/independent-production-fund-assume-production-181800467.html|title=Independent Production Fund to Assume Production Funding Activities of Cogeco Program Development Fund and Receive Annual Financial Contributions From Cogeco Communications Inc.|last=|first=|date=May 23, 2018|website=Yahoo! Finance|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1991 to 2010 the IPF invested over $47M in 251 Canadian television drama series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipf.ca/AnnualReports/IPF-REPORT-2010.pdf|title=IPF Annual Report 2010|last=|first=|date=May 23, 2018|website=IPF Website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the IPF’s mandate was revised to focus funding on drama series created for new digital platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=15 Canadian web series get funding from the Independent Production Fund|url=http://www.nsi-canada.ca/2011/06/15-canadian-web-series-get-funding-from-the-independent-production-fund/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Financing for Web Drama|url=http://www.jillgolick.com/2010/01/financing-for-web-drama/|website=Running with My Eyes Closed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krewen|first1=Nick|title=IPF renews web series funding indefinitely|url=http://playbackonline.ca/2013/12/03/ipf-renews-web-series-funding-indefinitely/|website=Playback}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allocates nearly $2M per year from the interest generated by the endowment and recoupment of its funding investments, to original digital drama series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cummins|first1=Julianna|title=IPF invests nearly $2M across 17 web series|url=http://playbackonline.ca/2014/06/23/ipf-invests-nearly-2m-across-17-web-series/|website=Playback}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2010-2017 the IPF invested $12.8M in 114 short form scripted digital series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ipf.ca/AR2017/statistics/|title=IPF Annual Report 2017|last=|first=|date=May 23, 2018|website=IPF Website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Industrial computed tomography''' ('''CT''') '''scanning''' is any computer-aided [[tomography|tomographic]] process, usually [[X-ray computed tomography]], that uses [[irradiation]] to produce three-dimensional internal and external representations of a scanned object. Industrial CT scanning has been used in many areas of industry for internal inspection of components. Some of the key uses for industrial CT scanning have been flaw detection, failure analysis, metrology, assembly analysis and [[reverse engineering]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;Flisch, A., et al. Industrial Computer Tomography in Reverse Engineering Applications. DGZfP-Proceedings BB 67-CD Paper 8, Computerized Tomography for Industrial Applications and Image Processing in Radiology, March 15–17, 1999, Berlin, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woods, Susan. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110821224332/http://micromanufacturing.com/showthread.php?t=876 "3-D CT inspection offers a full view of microparts"], November 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as in [[medical imaging]], industrial imaging includes both nontomographic radiography ([[industrial radiography]]) and computed tomographic radiography (computed tomography).

==Types of scanners==
[[File:CT Scanner Line Beam.jpg|thumb|alt=CT Scanner Beamline|right|Line beam scanner]]

''Line beam scanning'' is the traditional process of industrial CT scanning.&lt;ref name="Hofmann"&gt;Hofmann, J., Flisch, A., Obrist, A., Adaptive CT scanning-mesh based optimisation methods for industrial X-ray computer tomography applications. NDT&amp;E International (37), 2004, pp. 271–278.&lt;/ref&gt; X-rays are produced and the beam is collimated to create a line. The X-ray line beam is then translated across the part and data is collected by the detector.  The data is then reconstructed to create a 3-D v[[Volume rendering|olume rendering]] of the part.

In ''cone beam scanning'', the part to be scanned is placed on a rotary table.&lt;ref name="Hofmann" /&gt; As the part rotates, the cone of X-rays produce a large number of 2D images that are collected by the detector. The 2D images are then processed to create a 3D [[volume rendering]] of the external and internal geometries of the part.

[[File:Cone Beam CT Scanner.png|thumb|alt=CT Scanner Beamline|right|Cone beam scanner]]

==History==
Industrial CT scanning technology was introduced in 1972 with the invention of the [[CT scan|CT scanner]] for medical imaging by [[Godfrey Hounsfield]]. The invention earned him a Nobel Prize in medicine, which he shared with [[Allan McLeod Cormack]].&lt;ref&gt;Zoofan, Bahman. [http://www.3dscanningtechnologies.com/ComputedTomographyPage.php?3D_Micro-Tomography_-_A_Powerful_Engineering_Tool-4/ "3D Micro-Tomography – A Powerful Engineering Tool"]. 3D Scanning Technologies. July 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3dscanningtechnologies.com/pdfs/parts.pdf Noel, Julien. "Advantages of CT in 3D Scanning of Industrial Parts]. August 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Many advances in CT scanning have allowed for its use in the industrial field for metrology in addition to the visual inspection primarily used in the medical field (medical [[CT scan]]).

==Analysis and inspection techniques==
Various inspection uses and techniques include part-to-CAD comparisons, part-to-part comparisons, assembly and defect analysis, void analysis, wall thickness analysis, and generation of CAD data. The CAD data can be used for [[reverse engineering]], geometric dimensioning and tolerance analysis, and production part approval.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714085255/http://www.micromanu.com/x/guideArchiveArticle.html?id=1695 "Reducing Preproduction Inspection Costs with Industrial (CT) Computed Tomography."] Micro Manufacturing Magazine for the global micro manufacturing technology industry, August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assembly===
One of the most recognized forms of analysis using CT is for assembly, or visual analysis. CT scanning provides views inside components in their functioning position, without disassembly. Some software programs for industrial CT scanning allow for measurements to be taken from the CT dataset volume rendering. These measurements are useful for determining the clearances between assembled parts or the dimension of an individual feature.[[File:Industrial Computed Tomography - Failures - Void.jpg|thumb|An industrial computed tomography (CT) scan conducted on an aluminum casting to identify internal failures such as voids. All color coordinated particles within casting are voids/porosity/air pockets, which can additionally be measured and are color coordinated according to size.]]

===Void, crack and defect detection===
[[File:Peppergrinder 3D-flight-through microCT.OGG|thumb|Flight through a 3D reconstruction of a disposable pepper grinder. Glass in blue.]]

Traditionally, determining defects, voids and cracks within an object would require destructive testing. CT scanning can detect internal features and flaws displaying this information in 3D without destroying the part. Industrial CT scanning (3D X-ray) is used to detect flaws inside a part such as porosity,&lt;ref name=Lambert&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lambert | first1 = J. | last2 = Chambers | first2 = A.

Metal casting and moulded plastic components are typically prone to porosity because of cooling processes, transitions between thick and thin walls, and material properties. Void analysis can be used to locate, measure, and analyze voids inside plastic or metal components.

===Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing analysis===
Traditionally, without destructive testing, full metrology has only been performed on the exterior dimensions of components, such as with a [[coordinate-measuring machine]] or with a vision system to map exterior surfaces. Internal inspection methods would require using a 2D X-ray of the component or the use of destructive testing. Industrial CT scanning allows for full non-destructive metrology.

===Image-based finite element methods===
Image-based finite element method converts the 3D image data from X-ray computed tomography directly into meshes for [[Finite element method|finite element analysis]]. Benefits of this method include modelling complex geometries (e.g. composite materials) or accurately modelling "as manufactured" components at the micro-scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Transient thermal finite element analysis of CFC–Cu ITER monoblock using X-ray tomography data|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277338941_Transient_thermal_finite_element_analysis_of_CFCCu_ITER_monoblock_using_X-ray_tomography_data|journal = Fusion Engineering and Design|date = 2015-05-28|pages = 100–111|volume = 100|doi = 10.1016/j.fusengdes.2015.04.048|first = Ll.

[[File:Micronet800logo.gif|thumb|right|Logo]]
'''Micronet 800''' was an information provider (IP) on [[Prestel]], aimed at the 1980s personal computer market. It was an online magazine that gave subscribers computer related news, reviews, general subject articles and downloadable [[telesoftware]].

Users would log onto the [[Prestel]] network (which was usually a local call) and then access the Micronet 800 home page by entering *800# (hence the name) on their modem or computer.  Most Micronet 800 members would have their default main index page set to page 800 automatically.

==History==
The name Micronet 800 derives from its home page, 800, on the BT Prestel videotext service.

Micronet 800 derived from the earlier development in 1980 and 1981 of 'Electronic Insight' by Bob Denton. Electronic Insight was a Prestel-based feature-and-price-comparison site listing computers, calculators and other electronic and IT products, whose main page was on page 800 of Prestel.  Electronic Insight was acquired by Telemap Group, a part of EMAP, East Midland (note, not Midlands) Allied Press, in 1982 on the recommendation of Richard Hease, a number of whose computer magazines EMAP had just bought.  Telemap had been formed in 1981 to explore the opportunities of British Telecom's Prestel videotext service.  It had been looking at the horticultural market that EMAP served with a number of magazine titles, notably providing a 'Closed User Group' purchasing network for garden centre businesses, complementing EMAP's printed 'Garden Trade News' magazine. But horticulturalists and IT proved not to be a natural marriage, and the service had insufficient users to make it viable.

Richard Hease, in 1982 Chairman of EMAP's Computer &amp; Business Press which had acquired Electronic Insight, organised a pitch to the Telemap Group by David Babsky of a projected interactive online computer magazine to replace the existing content of Electronic Insight. Babsky showed a 'dummy issue' of the intended online magazine, programmed in [[Integer BASIC]] on an [[Apple II]] computer. Hease suggested that there be several different 'areas' of the magazine, with titles such as MicroNews, MicroNet (for those interested in networking), etc., and Babsky proposed that the entire project be called 'Micronet 800' to ensure that it could be easily found by anyone using Prestel, as its page number would be part of its name. Hease and Denton negotiated with BT Prestel for a special relationship that would rank it alongside the Nottingham Building Society's plans for its Homelink as the two key thrusts for Prestel.

Hease negotiated with then telecoms minister [[John Butcher (British politician)|John Butcher]] a £25 subsidy for Micronet subscribers to have their homes equipped free with a telephone jack-socket for the relevant modem.

The Telemap editorial staff was first based at 8 Herbal Hill, [[Clerkenwell]], [[London]] (after the preliminary discussions and presentation at EMAP's offices in [[Hatton Garden]]), and the technical staff in an EMAP building in [[Peterborough]]. In 1986 the technical staff moved down to the London building.

Telemap was to be the base for Micronet 800 and the editorial development of the site. Hease's and Denton's '''Prism Micro Products''',&lt;ref name="vtu"&gt;Viewdata and TV user, January 1983, [http://www.viewdata.org.uk/download.php?cat=15_Prestel&amp;file=vatu-v6i1-p8.pdf Page 8]&lt;/ref&gt; the exclusive distributor of Sinclair Computers in the UK, was charged with developing the required modems for the enterprise, to ensure that Micronet 800's pages could be accessed by such 'microcomputers' as [[Apple II]], Sinclair [[ZX81]], [[BBC Micro]]computer, [[Dragon 32/64|Dragon]], [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PCs]], [[Commodore PET]]s, and subsequently the Sinclair [[ZX Spectrum|Spectrum]] and [[Sinclair QL|QL]], [[Camputers Lynx|Lynx]], Commodore [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC 20]] and [[Commodore 64|64]] and others of the first wave of 1980s [[home computer]]s.

Although fast by contemporary standards, Prestel modems were quite slow from today's point of view (1200 [[baud]] download, 75 upload) and the display was just 24 lines of 40 characters, with seven colours and very simple block graphics. Yet Micronet 800 had versions of many of the Internet's subsequent features, especially an interactive 'ChatLine' (similar to Internet Relay Chat) developed by Mike Brown, who joined Micronet 800 from the Council for Educational Technology, where he'd devised a standard UK format for downloadable programs which became known as 'telesoftware'.

Micronet 800 was quite similar in scope to, and compatible with, the German Bildschirmtext and French Minitel services, but Minitel achieved volume sales for its terminals by the simple expedient of replacing paper telephone books with their terminals. Based on its success, Minitel proved resilient against the Internet adoption in France.

For Micronet, Denton negotiated that the interested parties would all agree to adopt the CET, Council for Educational Technology, format for telesoftware - one of two then competing formats.  Telesoftware allowed users to download software directly from the Prestel site. Micronet then negotiated with hobbyist computer groups to provide applications and utilities that would be listed on, and be downloadable from, the Micronet 800 site. Approximately 50% of software - for Sinclair, Apple, BBC Micro, IBM, etc. - was available at no cost, and the other 50% was paid for by the automatic addition of the cost of the software to the subscriber's telephone bill.

Prism developed a broad range of modems from a simple acoustic coupler to integrated 'network interfaces' for each of the early home and personal computers.  Prism models included the VTX5000, the only modem custom designed for the popular Sinclair [[ZX Spectrum]], and the more general purpose Modem 1000 and Modem 2000. These were ready-to-use out of a box, so that the buyer would get the modem with all relevant leads, cards (if necessary) and software to connect with Micronet.

Some 25,000 subscribers were eventually signed up to Micronet 800 to make it the largest CUG, Closed User Group, on Prestel; its total user base peaked at 90,000. Micronet achieved over 1.1 million page views a week. Its first subscriber, who joined on its opening day, 1 March 1983, was Jeremy Dredge, an estate agent from [[Thames Ditton]] in Surrey. Its 10,000th subscriber was Tom Corcoran, a director of BBC television's [[Top Of The Pops]].

In 1985 Telemap saw that Prism was preoccupied with its Sinclair computer distribution agency and in developing Prism's own 'luggable' Wren microcomputer, so prospective Micronet subscribers were then sent a list of several other modem suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viewdata.org.uk/download.php?cat=15_Prestel&amp;file=Cover%20letter%20and%20modem%20suppliers.pdf Letter accompanying brochure]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Prism's collapse in 1985 and the subsequent purchase of their stock by Telemap, and in a bid to increase take-up, Micronet 800 encouraged users by giving away a free modem to new users subscribing for a year.

However, in a move that saw the demise of Micronet, Prestel priced the home user out of the service with a new pricing structure, adding time charges on top of the phone charges for evening access which effectively killed off home usage even though the network was under-utilized during the 6{{nbsp}}pm to 8{{nbsp}}am time-slot. Today this remains the peak usage time of the Internet.

Many of the lessons learned with respect to online publishing and interactive services were pioneered by Micronet 800 and became every bit as important with the growth of the Internet.

BT became the majority shareholder in 1987 (after a previous 19% Telemap stake had been sold to [[Bell Canada]]) initially managing the company as part of BT Spectrum, its Value Added Services Group, before passing the group to BT Prestel. In 1988 the company passed a milestone by becoming the only Value Added Data service to become profitable. In 1989 BT finally acquired the entire company,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viewdata.org.uk/download.php?cat=15_Prestel&amp;file=LogOn9Autumn1989.pdf "Log On, the magazine for MicronetMembers", Autum 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; moved it into a BT building (Dialcom House) in [[Apsley, Hertfordshire|Apsley]], just outside [[Hemel Hempstead]] in [[Hertfordshire]], and folded the business into first the [[Dialcom]] Group along with the rest of the BT Prestel companies and [[Telecom Gold]] and subsequently BT Managed Network Services.

In 1991 along with all its online services, BT closed the service deciding to focus on providing network services and transferred the subscriber base to Compuserve which subsequently became AOL in the UK.

The Micronet service closed 31 October 1991. It had 10,000 members at closure and was "easily the largest online service in the UK specialising in microcomputing".&lt;ref&gt;Letter from BT to customers 27 September 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this apparent success, this was less than 10% of the number of users they were predicting having shortly after launch.&lt;ref name="vtu"/&gt;

[[File:Micronet800page.jpg|thumb|right|Micronet 800 page c. 1985, transcribed at the time onto Micronet 800 headed paper. This was a competition entry in Micronet's popular [[science fiction]] pages]]
Micronet 800 pioneered many public online services, such as Multi User Games, long before the Internet was in widespread use.
*[[Discussion board|Chatlines]]: Users could post messages that other users could see and respond to. Celebrity Chatline was a weekly feature conceived by Publisher Ian Rock and implemented by Sid Smith in which a prominent person was interviewed by Micronet users whose questions appeared onscreen, with Micronet personnel usually typing the answers (if the 'celebrity' couldn't type or format the text themselves). Early 'celebrities' included Sir [[Clive Sinclair]], [[Feargal Sharkey]], [[Fatima Whitbread]] and [[David Brudenell-Bruce, Earl of Cardigan|Lord Cardigan]].
*Downloadable software: Micronet 800 implemented the CET specification that allowed 8 bit files to be transmitted over a 7 bit medium, with some basic error detection and error correction.
*[[Online game]]s: The longest-running game on the system was StarNet, a [[Play-by-mail]] game, whereby the players would send in moves which would be executed once a day (a sort of very slow game of chess, where the aim was to become the emperor of the galaxy) run by Liverpudlian Mike Singleton by inputting the moves he was forwarded by email from Micronet into a [[Commodore PET]] computer. Micronet 800 also hosted [[SHADES]], one of the first [[MUD]]s - a realtime, highly competitive hack-and-slash game that is still running today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://games.world.co.uk/shades/inshades/history/Mags.htm "SHADES - What the computer magazines used to say..."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430090107/http://games.world.co.uk/shades/inshades/history/Mags.htm |date=30 April 2009 }} at games.world.co.uk. Accessed 18 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[E-mail]]: Each Prestel user had a unique number (usually the last nine digits of the subscriber's telephone number), and this could be used to send messages. Micronet users were reported to be particularly enthusiastic about the medium, sending twice as many 'mailbox' messages as regular Prestel users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/037/news.htm ''Micronet Matters - Sinclair User 37 (by Sid Smith)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717004544/http://www.sincuser.f9.co.uk/037/news.htm |date=17 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July 1984 users could send a pre-formatted 'Happy Birthday' email to [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] via [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]], in whose name the Buckingham Palace press office telephone number had been registered as a Prestel user.
*Gallery: Conceived by Publisher Ian Rock, this was an area where users could post their own pages about anything they wished, subject to minor oversight for libel and obscenity.
*News and reviews: Micronet was frequently the first organisation worldwide to report on happenings in the UK computer industry.

== Research career ==
McKinnon's research interests center on disaster management, preparedness, and communication, working at the intersection of scientific research, advocacy and policy. In the policy arena, she resolved to apply her expertise in both science and communication to teach science to disaster managers, revising [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]]'s (FEMA) science curriculum for emergency managers as a contractor and working on several projects with [[Natural Resources Canada]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  

McKinnon is currently a co-investigator of Project ESPRESSO, lending her expertise in terrestrial landslides and hazard mapping towards the project's goal of characterizing extraterrestrial target surfaces—asteroids, comets, and moons—and reducing other operational risks for robots and humans in space exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.espresso.institute/team/|title=Team|website=ESPRESSO|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project, which represents a consortium of seven partner institutions, was proposed in response to [[NASA]]'s 2016 call for Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute nodes, and is one of thirteen selected projects resulting from that call.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sservi.nasa.gov/sserviteams/|title=U.S. Teams|work=Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She holds a joint appointment at the [[SETI Institute]], one of ESPRESSO's partner institutions.  

== Science communication ==
McKinnon's science communication efforts range from popular [[science writing]] to consulting on the hit television show [[Stargate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/18647-mika-mckinnon-stargate-star-trek-beyond-sci-fi-physics|title=This Physicist Makes Sure 'Stargate' Is Scientifically Accurate|work=Inverse|access-date=2018-07-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201706/profiles.cfm|title=Profiles In Versatility: Mika McKinnon|last=|first=|date=|website=American Physical Society|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, McKinnon has consulted on Doomsday: 10 Ways the World Will End, [[No Tomorrow (TV series)|No Tomorrow]], [[Madam Secretary (TV series)|Madam Secretary]], and [[Star Trek: Discovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm8802986/|title=Mika McKinnon|website=IMDb|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a profile with her alma mater, [[UCSB]], she notes that her interest in communication stemmed from the media's misrepresentation of a major landslide in the Pacific Northwest.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was a contributing editor for [[Gawker Media]], providing coverage on popular science topics for [[io9]] and later became a science writer for [[Gizmodo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kinja.com/spacemika|title=Mika McKinnon|website=Kinja.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her bylines cover a range of topics including space exploration, dinosaur discovery, the convergence of science and art, and disaster preparedness.

'''Moley Robotics''' is a [[robotics]] company headquartered in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. It was founded by Mark Oleynik in 2015 to create [[service robot]]s for [[kitchen]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://time.com/3819525/robot-chef-moley-robotics/  |title=Meet The Robot Chef That Can Prepare Your Dinner |date= 14 April 2015  |author=Megan Gibson   |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/13/future-of-food-how-we-cook  |title= Future of food: how we cook |date= 13 September 2015  |author=Nicola Davis, Stephen Burgen and Zoë Corbyn  |publisher=[[The Guardian]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is best known for creating the first robot kitchen called The Moley Robotic Kitchen (MK1).&lt;ref name="shadow1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discovery.com/dscovrd/tech/meet-the-worlds-first-robotic-kitchen/  |title=Meet the World's First Robotic Kitchen |date= 14 April 2015  |author=  |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/kochroboter-moley-robotics-lehrt-maschine-kochen-a-1066971.html  |title= Maschine am Herd: Gestatten, RoboKoch |date= 11  December 2015  |author=  |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-32282131  |title='Robot chef' aimed at home kitchen |date= 14 April 2015  |author= Jonathan Amos  |publisher=[[BBC News]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Mark Oleynik, a computer scientist, founded the Moley Robotics in 2014 as a way to have good food at home without the skills to make it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/robot-make-me-dinner-180957535/?no-ist  |title= This Robot Will Make You Dinner |date=  |author=  |publisher=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Moley Robotics partnered started working on a [[robotic kitchen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3037493/Moley-Robotics-robotic-hands-whip-favourite-recipes-order.html  |title=Robocook: The $14,000 extra pair of hands in the kitchen that can whip up your favorite recipes |date=13 April 2015  |author= Katherine Rushton  |publisher=[[Daily Mail]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the company introduced its Robotic Kitchen. It made its debut at the [[Hannover Messe]] [[industrial robotics]] trade fair in [[Hannover, Germany]] in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://m.chinadaily.com.cn/en/2015-04/14/content_20432333.htm  |title= Merkel, Modi visit Hannover Messe |date= 14 April 2015  |author=  |publisher=[[China Daily]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Robotic Kitchen has been distinguished in several international science and engineering events. In May 2015, the Robotic Kitchen won the "Best of the Best" [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]] [[Shanghai]] award in [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ingenieur.de/Panorama/Hannover-Messe/Kochender-Roboter-sensiblen-Haenden  |title=Hannover Messe 2015 - Kochender Roboter mit sensiblen Händen |date=  |author=  |publisher= Ingenieur.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2016, the prototype was finalist at the first edition of the UAE [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] &amp; Robotics Award in  the international category, health sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.roboticsforgood.ae/finals/moley-robotic-kitchen  |title= The UAE AI &amp; Robotics Award for Good - Moley Robotic Kitchen |date=  |author=  |publisher= Robotics for Good }}&lt;/ref&gt; The consumer version of the Robotic Kitchen is slated to launch in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/multimedia/photo-gallery/2015/4/photos-robots-star-at-industrial-trade-fair-in-germany.html  |title= Photos: Robots star at industrial trade fair in Germany |date=13 April 2015  |author=  |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Robotic Kitchen ==
The current prototype of the Moley Robotic Kitchen includes two [[robotic arm]]s with hands equipped with tactile sensors, an [[oven]], an electric [[stove]], a [[dishwasher]] and a [[touchscreen]] unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21648474-ultimate-kitchen-gadget-home-has-everything-robotic  |title= Robochef gets cooking |date=18 April 2015  |author=  |publisher=[[The Economist]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-june-23-2015-1.3123898/robot-chef-could-revolutionize-or-kill-home-cooking-1.3123926  |title='Robot Chef' could revolutionize or kill home cooking |date= 23 June 2015  |author= Shannon Higgins and Sujata Berry  |publisher=[[CBC Radio]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These artificial hands can pick up and interact with most kitchen equipment, such as [[blender]]s, [[whisk]]s, knives and the [[Kitchen stove|hob]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.gov.uk/government/news/robotics-innovation-a-kitchen-that-cooks-for-itself  |title= Robotics innovation: a kitchen that cooks for itself |date= 20  May 2015  |author=  |publisher=[[GOV.UK]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It captures, with an integrated [[Stereo camera|3D camera]] and [[wired glove]], the entire work of a human chef and upload it into a [[database]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/04/23/technology/robot-chef/  |title=Robo chef: Would you trust a cook with no taste buds? |date=23 April 2015  |author= Sheena McKenzie  |publisher=[[CNNMoney]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chef's actions are translated into digital movements using [[gesture recognition]] algorithms created in collaboration with [[Stanford University]] and [[Carnegie Mellon University]] professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techinsider.io/moley-to-present-the-worlds-first-robot-kitchen-in-2017-2015-11  |title= The world's first robot kitchen is coming |date= 19 November 2015  |author= Danielle Muoio  |publisher=[[Business Insider#Tech Insider|Tech Insider]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, The Robotic Kitchen reproduces the whole sequence of actions to cook an identical meal from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11534416/Robotic-hands-cook-any-dish-with-skill-of-master-chef...then-clean-up.html  |title= Robotic hands cook any dish with skill of master chef...then clean up |date= 14 April 2015  |author= Sarah Knapton  |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.thestar.com/life/2015/04/17/robot-kitchen-serves-up-dinner-with-skill-and-flair.html  |title=Robot kitchen serves up dinner with 'skill and flair' |date= 17 April 2015  |author=  |publisher=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the current prototype, the user operates the installation via a built-in touchscreen or smartphone application with cooking ingredients prepared in advance and put in preset locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roboterwelt.de/magazin/haute-cuisine-a-la-moley-robotics/  |title= Haute Cuisine à la Moley Robotics |date= 28  May 2015  |author=  |publisher= Roboterwelt  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moley Robotic's objective in the future is to enable the user to select from a  library of over 2,000 recorded [[recipe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/robotic-chef-prepare-meals-homes-starting-2017/  |title= Robot chef coming to a kitchen near you in 2017 |date= 18 April 2015  |author= Carey Reed  |publisher=[[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.publico.pt/tecnologia/noticia/e-se-a-cozinha-viesse-com-um-robo-chef-1692374  |title=E se a cozinha viesse com um robô chef? |date= 16 April 2015  |author=  |publisher=[[Público (Portugal)]]  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In red the chlorophyll, in yellow the oil. In the majority of the cells of this culture oil represents a substantial fraction of the cell volume. The picture was shot using a confocal microscope by Elisa Corteggiani Carpinelli and the method used is the same described in [http://mplant.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/08/19/mp.sst120 Corteggiani Carpinelli, E. et al., (2013)] ]]
''[[Nannochloropsis]]'' is a genus of [[alga]] within the [[heterokont]] line of [[eukaryotes]], that is being investigated for [[biofuel]] production. One marine ''Nannochloropsis'' species has been shown to be suitable for algal biofuel production due to its ease of growth and high oil content (28.7% of dry weight), mainly unsaturated fatty acids and a significant percentage of palmitic acid. It also contains enough unsaturated fatty acid linolenic acid and polyunsaturated acid (&gt;4 double bonds) for a quality [[biodiesel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gouveia|first=L|author2=Oliveira|title=Microalgae as a raw material for biofuels production|journal=J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol|date=4 Nov 2009|pmid=18982369|doi=10.1007/s10295-008-0495-6|volume=36|issue=2|pages=269–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions that lead to oil content increase==
Oil productivity is defined as the oil produced by the algae per day per liter of culture, which is dependent on both growth rate and lipid content. Growth rate indicates how rapid the algae grow and lipid content indicates the percentage of dry weight that is lipid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huerlimann|first=R|author2=de Nys, Heimann|title=Growth, Lipid Content, Productivity, and Fatty Acid Composition of Tropical Microalgae for Scale-Up Production|journal=[[Biotechnol Bioeng]]|date=1 Oct 2010|pmid=20506156|doi=10.1002/bit.22809|volume=107|issue=2|pages=245–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most of the studies, these two factors are investigated independently. Under normal growth conditions, ''Nannochloropsis'' does not reach its optimal oil production. Several conditions, including stress conditions, have been reported to increase oil content in ''Nannochloropsis''.

===Nitrogen deprivation===
[[Nitrogen]] is essential for algal growth. Within a cell, nitrogen is involved in synthesizing amino acids, nucleic acids, [[chlorophyll]], and other nitrogen-containing organic compounds.&lt;ref name=algae&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham|first=L|title=Algae|year=2009|publisher=Pearson|location=USA|isbn=0-321-55965-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study in which 30 different microalgal strains were screened, one ''Nannochloropsis'' strain was shown to obtain 60% lipid content after nitrogen deprivation, up from 30% under normal growth conditions.&lt;ref name=mforo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodolfi|first=L|author2=Chini Zittelli|title=Microalgae for oil: strain selection, induction of lipid synthesis and outdoor mass cultivation in a low-cost photobioreactor|journal=[[Biotechnol Bioeng]]|date=1 Jan 2009|pmid=18683258|doi=10.1002/bit.22033|volume=102|issue=1|pages=100–12|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strain was selected for further scale-up experiments in a photobioreactor under natural sunlight. Lipid productivity increased to 204 milligram per liter per day(mg/L/day) under nitrogen starvation conditions, almost twice as much as the 117&amp;nbsp;mg/L/day under sufficient nutrition conditions. Based on these results, a two-phase cultivation process, with a nutrient sufficient phase to rapidly increase number of cells prior to a nitrogen deprived phase to boost lipid content, was found to produce more than 90&amp;nbsp;kg of lipid per hectare per day in outdoor cultures. I, depending on sun light conditions.&lt;ref name=mforo /&gt;

===Carbon dioxide aeration===
Algae play an important role in earth's [[carbon cycle]]. Algae generate large deposits of carbonate minerals and organic compounds that are resistant to microbial breakdown, thereby contributing to the reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; level in the atmosphere, making the earth more habitable for other organisms.&lt;ref name=algae /&gt; The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration also has an effect on algae growth and lipid content. In ''Nannochloropsis oculata'', the effect of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration on biomass production and lipid accumulation was investigated. The results showed that the lipid content of ''N. oculata'' increased from 30.8% to 50.4% upon 2% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; aeration. Thus, this algal strain is recommended to be grown with 2% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to maximize lipid production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chiu|first=SY|author2=Kao|title=Lipid accumulation and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization of ''N. oculata'' in response to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; aeration|journal=Bioresour Technol|date=Jan 2009|pmid=18722767|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2008.06.061|volume=100|issue=2|pages=833–8|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue light and Ultraviolet A (UV-A)===
A light-acquisition problem exists for aquatic algae since submergence can reduce light intensity and dampen photosynthesis. For land plants, full-spectrum of sunlight, from blue to red light, is available for chlorophyll absorption. However, red light is absorbed in the few meters of water closest to the surface of an aquatic environment and the light environment beneath these few meters is mainly blue-green in quality. Algal cells are likely to be transported to such depth of water, and many have evolved a mechanism to better absorb blue-green light.&lt;ref name=algae /&gt; A ''Nannochloropsis'' species isolated from Singapore's coastal water was investigated under different light wavelengths (red, green, blue, and white) and intensities to determine the optimal condition for biomass productivity and lipid production. The maximum fatty acid yield was achieved for both phototrophic (sunlight is the only energy source) and mixotrophic (utilize both sunlight and energy from carbon source) cultures at 55.15 and 111.96&amp;nbsp;mg/L, respectively, under cell exposure to blue light (470&amp;nbsp;nm). The biomass productivity of the algae also peaked under blue light for both cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Das|first=P|author2=Lei|title=Enhanced algae growth in both phototrophic and mixotrophic culture under blue light|journal=Bioresour Technol|date=Feb 2011|pmid=21183340|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2010.11.102|volume=102|issue=4|pages=3883–7|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, [[UV-A]] (320 - 400&amp;nbsp;nm) was added to the photosynthetically active light spectrum (400 - 700&amp;nbsp;nm) to culture ''Nannochloropsis'' in order to study the effect of UV-A on growth and lipid accumulation. The results showed that modulated UV-A usage can lead to an increase in growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forjan|first=E|author2=Garbayo|title=UV-A mediated modulation of photosynthetic efficiency, xanthophyll cycle and fatty acid production of ''Nannochloropsis''|journal=Mar Biotechnol|date=17 Jul 2010|pmid=20640472|doi=10.1007/s10126-010-9306-y|volume=13|issue=3|pages=366–75|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alginate oligosaccharides===
Alginate, or [[alginic acid]],  is a natural acidic linear polysaccharide derived from seaweed. It is composed of α-L-guluronate and β-D-mannuronate. Bulk alginate is widely used in the food industry and for medical purposes due to its unique characteristics such as high viscosity in aqueous solution and gel-forming property in the presence of calcium ions. Previous studies have also shown that alginate oligosaccharides may act as growth promoting agents on some plant cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xu|first=X|author2=Iwamoto|title=Root growth-promoting activity of unsaturated oligomeric uronates from alginate on carrot and rice plants|journal=Biosci Biotechnol Biochem|date=Sep 2003|pmid=14519996|volume=67|issue=9|pages=2022–5|doi=10.1271/bbb.67.2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of an alginate oligosaccharide mixture (AOM) on ''N. oculata'' was studied. The growth rate of this alga was significantly increased by AOM. Moreover, AOM appeared to alleviate the algicidal effect of Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; significantly. These results suggests that AOM can be used a growth promoting supplement for ''N. oculata'' culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yokose|first=T|author2=Nishikawa|title=Growth-promoting effect of alginate oligosaccharides on a unicellular marine microalga, ''Nannochloropsis oculata''|journal=Biosci Biotechnol Biochem|date=Feb 2003|pmid=19202274|volume=73|issue=2|pages=450–3|doi=10.1271/bbb.80692|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature===
Temp has significant impact on algal growth rate, cell size, and biochemical composition. Either in natural habitats of algae or in controlled growth systems, temperature will vary. In a study on the effect of temperature on growth rate and lipid content, temperature showed no significant relation with ''Nannochloropsis sp.'' growth rate between 15&amp;nbsp;°C and 30&amp;nbsp;°C. However, another algal species in the same study, ''Isochrysis galbana'', showed increased growth rate as the temperature increased from 15&amp;nbsp;°C to 30&amp;nbsp;°C. In many algal species, increased lipid content is also observed under increased temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sayegh|first=FA|author2=Montagnes|title=Temperature shifts induce intraspecific variation in microalgal production and biochemical composition|journal=Bioresour Technol|date=Feb 2011|pmid=20970325|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2010.10.011|volume=102|issue=3|pages=3007–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture technologies==
Different culture technologies are being tested with ''Nannochloropsis'' to determine most cost-effective culture methods.

===Helical-tubular photobioreactor===
Tubular systems are the most widely used commercial culture systems. They are usually made of polypropylene acrylic or polyvinylchloride pipes which have small internal diameters and an air pump that generates bubbles to mix and agitate the culture. They usually use artificial light but some models use natural light. The major disadvantages of this type of system, varying among individual systems, are high space requirements, cleaning, low efficiency, low gas transfer, and hydrodynamic stress. Several other problems also occur, including growth of the algae on the tube wall leading to blockage of light, high oxygen concentration inhibition of growth, and limits on the length of the tube in single run. Coiled systems were developed mainly to improve space utilization. The main advantages are: 1) large ratio of culture volume to surface area and optimized light penetration depth; 2) easy control over temperature and contaminants; 3) easy spatial distribution of fresh air and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; 4) better CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transfer through the culture; and 5) automated sensor providing cell concentration reads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Briassoulis|first=D|author2=Panagakis|title=An experimental helical-tubular photobioreactor for continuous production of ''Nannochloropsis sp''|journal=Bioresour Technol|date=Sep 2010|pmid=20400300|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2010.03.103|volume=101|issue=17|pages=6768–77|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open pond and flat-plate photobioreactor===
Raceway ponds are shallow ponds between 10 and 50&amp;nbsp;cm deep. They are less expensive to build compared to photobioreactors, and have low-energy-consuming paddlewheels to mix the circulate the culture. The culture is open to the atmosphere, thus allowing liquid evaporation to stabilize the temperature. They are widely used to culture several algae and cynobacteria. However, only limited types of microalgae can be grown in open ponds. Other disadvantages include large area required, low efficiency of light utilization, poor gas/liquid transfer, no temperature control, high risk of contamination, and low final density of culture.&lt;ref name=open&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jorquere|first=O|author2=Kiperstok|title=Comparative energy life-cycle analyses of microalgal biomass production in open ponds and photobioreactors|journal=Bioresour Technol|date=Feb 2010|pmid=19800784|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2009.09.038|volume=101|issue=4|pages=1406–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flat-plates are a closed system such as helical-tubular photobioreactor. They have a flat surface screen made of glass or optical light film for the even reception of light. A study compared the cultures of ''Nannochloropsis sp.'' in open ponds and photobioreactors, tubular and flat-plate. Horizontal tubular photobioreactor was not shown to be economically viable. Both open pond and flat-plate photoreactors were proven to be feasible, given that the lipid content of biomass could be increased to 60%. However, neither system is competitive due to the low cost of petroleum.&lt;ref name=open /&gt;

===Fed-batch culture===
Some algae can grow faster under mixotrophic conditions rather than under photoautotrophic conditions. Under mixotrophic conditions, both light and a carbon substrate such as sugars can provide energy for cell growth. Although adding glucose increased the growth rate of the algal culture, it also adds extra cost to algal lipid production. This needs to be further studied to determine economical feasibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xu|first=F|author2=Cai|title=Growth and fatty acid composition of ''Nannochloropsis sp.'' grown mixotrophically in fed-batch culture|journal=Biotechnol Lett|date=Sep 2004|pmid=15604757|doi=10.1023/B:BILE.0000045626.38354.1a|volume=26|issue=17|pages=1319–22|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flue gas method===
A unique bio-technology-based environmental system can utilize [[flue gas]] from coal burning power plants. This method is reported to decrease the cost of algae production significantly. It also absorbs excessive CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus alleviating greenhouse effect.&lt;ref name=diesel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koberg|first=M|author2=Cohen|title=Bio-diesel production directly from the microalgae biomass of ''Nannochloropsis'' by microwave and ultrasound radiation|journal=Bioresour Technol|date=Mar 2011|pmid=21208797|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2010.12.004|volume=102|issue=5|pages=4265–9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion to biodiesel or biofuel==
Several different technologies were reported to convert algal culture into biofuel or biodiesel.

===Direct transesterification===
A direct transesterification of ''Nannochloropsis'' biomass to biodiesel production can be achieved using either microwave or ultrasound radiation. The microwave method was shown to be the simplest and most efficient method for one-stage direct transesterification.&lt;ref name=diesel /&gt;

===Direct pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis===
In a recent study, ''Nannochloropsis sp.'' cells was pyrolyzed. The results showed that bio-oils obtained from catalytic pyrolysis had lower oxygen content and higher heating value than those from direct pyrolysis. The catalytic pyrolysis product mainly contained aromatic hydrocarbons. These properties make ''Nannochloropsis'' residue a very promising candidate for algal fuel production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pan|first=P|author2=Hu|title=The direct pyrolysis and catalytic pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis sp. residue for renewable bio-oils.|journal=Bioresour Technol|date=Jun 2010|pmid=20153636|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2010.01.070|volume=101|issue=12|pages=4593–9|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thames Estuary and Wind Farms from Space NASA.jpg|thumb||Satellite image of the [[Thames Estuary]] taken by OLI]]

The '''Operational Land Imager''' ('''OLI''') is a remote sensing instrument aboard [[Landsat 8]], built by [[Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies]]. Landsat 8 is the successor to [[Landsat 7]] and was launched in 2013.&lt;ref name="gerace"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Increased potential to monitor water quality in the near-shore environment with Landsat's next-generation satellite |journal=[[Journal of Applied Remote Sensing]] |first1=Aaron D. |last1=Gerace |first2=John R. |last2=Schott |first3=Robert |last3=Nevins |volume=7 |id=073558 |date=January 2013 |doi=10.1117/1.JRS.7.073558 |bibcode=2013JARS....7.3558G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OLI is a [[push broom scanner]] that uses a four-mirror telescope with fixed mirrors.

== Overview and mission ==
OLI operates alongside TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) onboard the LDCM.&lt;ref name="ltaL8"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/L8 |title=Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) |series=Long Term Archive |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The build and design of OLI differs from previous generations of instruments, while still maintaining data continuity with archived Landsat data from the last 40 years by keeping the same spectral and spatial resolutions of previous instruments.

OLI aids the Landsat-8 mission in the imaging of Earth's surface and the collection of moderate resolution data that is used to monitor changing trends on the surface and evaluate how land usage changes over time. The images and data that OLI has helped collect have practical applications today in agriculture, mapping, and monitoring changes in snow, ice, and water.&lt;ref name="Knight2014"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager Design, Characterization and Performance |journal=Remote Sensing |first1=Edward J. |last1=Knight |first2=Geir |last2=Kvaran |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=10286-10305 |date=October 2014 |doi=10.3390/rs61110286 |bibcode=2014RemS....610286K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Specifications and design ==
OLI is a pushbroom sensor that operates in the visible (VIS) and short wave infrared (SWIR) spectral regions.&lt;ref name="MurphyMorris2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://landsat.usgs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Murphy_Morris_Science_Team_OLI_chart.pdf |title=Operational Land Imager |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |first=Jeanine |last=Murphy-Morris |date=8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a swath width of {{convert|185|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}}, which means it can image the entire Earth over a repeating cycle of 16 days.&lt;ref name="ball-oli"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ball.com/aerospace/programs/oli |title=Operational Land Imager |publisher=Ball Aerospace |access-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; OLI uses nine channels, which range from wavelengths of 443&amp;nbsp;nm to 2,200&amp;nbsp;nm. Of these nine channels, eight are multispectral and one is panchromatic. The eight multispectral channels have a {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} spatial resolution, and the panchromatic channel has a spatial resolution of {{convert|15|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name="MurphyMorris2008" /&gt;

|}

While the spectral and spatial resolution of OLI's channels were kept the same as prior instruments in order to maintain data continuity with the entire Landsat archive, two spectral bands (the first a blue visible channel and the second an infrared channel) were added.&lt;ref name="Knight2014" /&gt; These bands were designated as band 1 and band 9, and serve as an enhancement from previous instruments, which lacked these channels. Band 1 was created to locate and determine water resources and investigate coastal areas, and band 9 serves a unique purpose of detecting cirrus clouds.&lt;ref name="ltaL8" /&gt;

== Applications ==
OLI has several different applications due to the many different bands. Band 1 is helpful in imaging shallow water resources and tracking aerosols. Bands 2, 3, and 4 are in the [[visible spectrum]] and are helpful in creating true color composite images. Band 5 is helpful for ecology purposes and can help determine vegetation index or [[Normalized difference vegetation index|NDVI]]. Bands 6 and 7 are useful in geology and can help in distinguishing different saturated and unsaturated rocks and soils. Band 8 is helpful in creating images with very high resolution and precision. Band 9 is used for detecting different types of clouds.&lt;ref name="L8-bands"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/landsat-8/landsat-8-bands/ |title=Landsat 8 Bands |series=Landsat Science |publisher=NASA/GSFC |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir John Philip Baxter''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|KBE|CMG|FAA}} (7 May 1905 – 5 September 1989), better known as '''Philip Baxter''', was a British [[chemical engineer]]. He was the second director of the [[University of New South Wales]] from 1953, continuing as [[vice-chancellor]] when the position's title was changed in 1955. Under his administration, the university grew from its technical college roots into the "fastest growing and most rapidly diversifying tertiary institution in Australia".&lt;ref name="UNSW"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/historicalresources/onlineexhibitions/vice-chancellor.html#baxter |title=The Vice-Chancellors of the University of New South Wales Exhibition |publisher=[[University of New South Wales]] |accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Baxter College]] is named in his honour.

Baxter was born in Wales, but grew up in England, entering the [[University of Birmingham]] at age 16. He joined [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] as a chemical engineer, and became head of the Central Laboratory of its General Chemicals Division in [[Widnes]], investigating the chemistry of [[chlorine]] and [[fluorine]]. He was elected to the Widnes Municipal Council in 1939, a seat he held until 1949. During the [[Second World War]] he provided [[James Chadwick]] with samples of [[uranium hexafluoride]] for [[Tube Alloys]], the British wartime [[nuclear weapons]] program, and later established a pilot plant to produce it in Widnes. In 1944, in response to a request from the Americans for someone with expertise in both uranium chemistry and industrial operations, he went to [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], to assist the [[Manhattan Project]].

Baxter was recruited by the then-New South Wales University of Technology as a professor of [[chemical engineering]] in 1949. He became one of the most prolific public advocates of nuclear power for Australia. He served as chairman of the [[Australian Atomic Energy Commission]] from 1957 to 1972 and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] from 1969 to 1970. He oversaw the construction of the [[High Flux Australian Reactor]] (HIFAR) at [[Lucas Heights, New South Wales|Lucas Heights]]. He also founded the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] (NIDA), and, as the chairman of the [[Sydney Opera House Trust]], brought the [[Sydney Opera House]] to completion and opening on 20 October 1973.

==Early life==
John Philip Baxter was born in [[Machynlleth]] in Wales on 7 May 1905, the younger child of John Baxter and his wife Mary Netta {{née}} Morton.&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |last=Gissing |first=Philip |id=A170072b |title=Baxter, Sir John Philip (1905–1989) |volume=17|year=2007 |pp=72–76 |accessdate=6 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an older sister, Muriel. His father was a [[telegraphist]] with the [[British Post Office]], as was his mother before her marriage. The family moved to [[Hereford]] in England,&lt;ref name="AAS"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Angyal |first=S.J. |title=Sir Philip Baxter 1905–1989 |url=http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/aasmemoirs/baxter.htm  |journal=Records of the Australian Academy of Science |volume=8 |issue=3 |year=1991 |accessdate=6 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he attended [[Aylestone Business and Enterprise College|Hereford High School for Boys]].&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; At school, he enjoyed playing tennis.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;

Baxter passed the [[Joint Matriculation Board|Northern Universities Matriculation]] examination when he was 14, but found that this was too young to be admitted to a university. He passed it again the following year, and then passed the University of London Matriculation examination the year after, when he was 16, after which he was permitted to enter the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt; He was interested in [[metallurgy]] and enrolled in a science course. He earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree with [[first class honours]] in 1925, and his [[Master of Science]] the following year.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; His main form of recreation remained tennis. With the help of a £250 per annum James Watt research scholarship,&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt; he wrote his 1928 [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) thesis on "The combustion of [[carbonic oxide]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |url=http://findit.bham.ac.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=44BIR_VU1&amp;search_scope=default_scope&amp;docId=44BIR_ALEPH_DS003278024&amp;fn=permalink |title=The combustion of carbonic oxide |first=J. P. |last=Baxter  |publisher=[[University of Birmingham]] |degree=PhD |year=1928 }}&lt;/ref&gt; under the supervision of F. H. Burstall.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

==Imperial Chemical Industries==
A recommendation from Burstall helped Baxter secure a research engineer position with [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) in [[Billingham]], where a new chemical factory had been established to make [[sodium hydroxide]]. Here he met Lilian May Thatcher, who worked as a [[stenographer]] in nearby [[Stockton-on-Tees]]. The two became engaged, but before they could marry, [[Alexander Fleck]] had Baxter transferred to ICI's new General Chemicals Division in [[Widnes]] as head of the Central Laboratory. Baxter and Lilian were married in the [[register office]] in Stockton-on-Tees on 17 August 1931. Three years later they designed and built their own home in [[Farnworth, Cheshire|Farnworth]], where they lived until 1949. They had four children: a daughter, Valerie; an adopted son, Peter; and sons Dennis and Roderick.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;

The Central Laboratory's focus at this time was on the chemistry of [[chlorine]] and [[fluorine]]. [[Chloralkali process|Electrolysis of salt water]] produced chlorine and sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), but there was not as much demand for the chlorine, so ICI was eager to create new products using chlorine that it could sell. New products that were created included various solvents, chlorinated rubber, and [[Lindane]], an [[insecticide]] developed in collaboration with ICI's [[Syngenta|Agricultural Research Station]] at [[Jealott's Hill]]. Baxter personally received a number of patents for his work. He became Research Manager of the General Chemicals Division in 1935. He reorganised the Central Laboratory into seven sections, each with its own Assistant Research Manager, an organisational structure known as "Baxter and the seven dwarves", which was not generally considered a success at the time.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;

In addition to his scientific work, Baxter was involved in local politics. He was elected to the Widnes Municipal Council in 1939, a seat he held until 1949. He was leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the Council, and chairman of the local party organisation in the [[Widnes (UK Parliament constituency)|Widnes UK Parliament constituency]].&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

==Tube Alloys==
In 1940, with Britain at war during the [[Second World War]], Baxter was approached by physicist [[James Chadwick]], who asked if he could supply a sample of [[uranium hexafluoride]].&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt; Baxter did so on a personal basis, using research money.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|p=52}} Chadwick then came back and asked Baxter if he could supply a much larger amount, about {{convert|3|kg}}. This time, Baxter demurred. The production of such a large quantity would require the purchase of additional equipment. ICI's [[hydrofluoric acid]] plant was out of commission and would require repairs. The bill for that amount of uranium hexafluoride would therefore come to around £3,000, a sum that he could not spend from research funds. He would require permission from senior ICI management, who would want to know if it would assist the war effort and whether 3 kg was all that would be required, or if further orders could be expected. Chadwick then revealed that this was part of a secret project, codenamed [[Tube Alloys]], the object of which was to build an atomic bomb. Permission from ICI management was secured by [[Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell|Frederick Lindemann]] making a direct approach to [[Henry Mond, 2nd Baron Melchett|Lord Melchett]], one of ICI's directors.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=62}}

ICI pilot plants for producing {{convert|1|long cwt|0|lk=on}} of pure uranium metal and {{convert|50|to|100|kg}} of uranium hexafluoride per diem commenced operation in Widnes in mid-1943.{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=228–229}} The following year, in response to a request from the Americans for someone with expertise in both uranium chemistry and industrial operations, Baxter was sent to [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], for three months to assist the [[Manhattan Project]].{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=258–260}} The [[Calutron|electromagnetic separation process]] had problems with the efficiency of its chemical processes for uranium recovery.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=145}} At the request of the director of the Manhattan Project, [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], Baxter subsequently returned to Oak Ridge for an indefinite period, this time with his family. He became the personal assistant to the general manager, with responsibility for coordinating research, development and production activities.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;{{sfn|Gowing|1964|pp=258–260}} For his wartime nuclear weapons work, Baxter was made an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] on 1 January 1946.&lt;ref name="OBE"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=37412|supp=y|page=276|date=28 December 1945}} ''Officer of the Order of the British Empire''&lt;/ref&gt;

Baxter returned to Widnes as Research Director of the General Chemicals Division after the war ended in 1945. He became a director of
Thorium Ltd,&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt; a company half owned by ICI that was involved in the production of radioactive substances,{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974|pp=319–322}} and was a consultant to the British nuclear energy program.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt; His General Chemicals Division at Widnes was involved in chemical separation of uranium products, which he considered a patriotic duty.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974|p=173}} Baxter was personally responsible for the research and development that was the basis for the design of the [[Springfields]] uranium hexafluoride plant, and was a member of the committee that oversaw the construction of the chemical separation plant to extract [[plutonium]].{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974|p=407}} Much to Baxter's disappointment,&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt; ICI management did not see nuclear energy as being part of its core mission, and disengaged from it.{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974|pp=174–175}} He also became dismayed at political and economic developments in the United Kingdom after the Conservatives lost office in 1945.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;

==University of New South Wales==

(left to right) {{ill|Gennadiy Yagodin|ru|Ягодин, Геннадий Алексеевич}}, Baxter and [[Robert Street]].]]
In 1949, Baxter heard that the [[New South Wales University of Technology]] was looking for a professor of [[chemical engineering]]. He applied, and was offered the job. Baxter and his family packed their belongings and sailed to Australia on the [[ocean liner]] ''[[SS Orcades (1948)|Orcades]]'', arriving in Sydney on 16 January 1950. They bought a house in [[Enfield, New South Wales|Enfield]], where Baxter would reside for the rest of his life. At the time the university was located in temporary accommodation on the grounds of the [[Sydney Technical College]] campus in [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]]. Baxter became the head of a new School of Chemical Engineering that was created on his arrival, but he initially had only one full-time staff member as most of the instruction was carried out by part-time staff. Although he had no previous teaching experience, he turned out to be a good, well-organised lecturer, and he worked closely with his first postgraduate students, whose research was into fields that Baxter had been involved with in England.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;

A number of other professors disliked the name and organisational structure of the university, and wanted it to shake off the association with "technology" and become a "real university". While Baxter did not side with them, contending that the university's association with the government provided funding and facilities, most of what he did moved in that direction. He hired full-time staff, and broadened the scope of the subjects taught and the research carried out. A Department of Food Technology was the first, and for many years the only, one of its kind in Australia. He replaced the diploma-level with a new bachelor of science in chemical engineering degree, offering conversion courses to allow students to upgrade their diplomas to degrees. The first chemical engineering students had enrolled in  1949, and nine graduated with the bachelor of science degree in 1952. The School of Chemical Engineering became the first school to relocate to the new campus in [[Kensington, New South Wales|Kensington]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

In February 1952, Baxter became deputy-director of the university. He defeated [[Arthur Denning]] in an election for director in December, assuming the position on 1 January 1953. As Denning had argued for the retention of the university's links with the Public Service Board, it was widely seen as a victory for the proponents of autonomy, but with his industrial background Baxter had little in common with the professors who came from academia, and did not share their views on the role and organisation of a university. The university did receive autonomy on 1 July 1954, and when traditional university titles were adopted in 1955, Baxter became [[vice-chancellor]].&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

[[File:Baxter Oliphant (1954).jpg|thumb|left|During a two-day symposium on "Atomic Power in Australia" at the New South Wales University of Technology, Sydney, which began on 31 August 1954, Professors [[Marcus Oliphant]] (left), [[Homi Jehangir Bhabha]] (centre) and Philip Baxter, meet over a cup of tea]]
A committee appointed by the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], [[Robert Menzies]], and chaired by [[Keith Murray, Baron Murray of Newhaven|Keith Murray]], recommended in 1957 that a medical school be established at Kensington. Its creation, followed by that of a Faculty of Arts, prompted the university to change its name to the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in 1958. Baxter established a number of unusual schools. He created a School of Nuclear Engineering in anticipation that a nuclear power industry would be established in Australia. He also created schools of Textile Technology, Wool Technology, Food Technology and Highway Engineering and Traffic Engineering. The School of Business Administration and an Institute of Administration was established in 1960, and ultimately the [[Australian Graduate School of Management]] in 1969. When the Faculty of Arts was created, he insisted that all Arts students take at least one science subject.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

In Baxter's eyes, the main role of the university was to provide trained engineers and technologists for industry, which he believed was suffering from a critical skill shortage. With this constantly in mind, he pursued a rapid expansion of the university. Student numbers grew from 3,751 when he became vice-chancellor in 1955, to over 15,988 when he retired in 1969. This was far short of the university of 25,000 students that he had hoped to create, but in the 1950s the idea of a university that large horrified some academics. Baxter considered it wasteful when good students returned to academia after only a brief time working in industry, but even more so when they dropped out or failed their courses. While his critics saw high failure rates as the inevitable result of lowering admission standards in order to boost student numbers, Baxter viewed it as result of poor teaching and inefficient administration. He walked out of a heated Staff Association meeting on the matter. To help industry, he established Unisearch Limited, a company that provided expert assistance in 1959.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unisearch.com.au/about/unisearch |title=Unisearch – Australia's leading provider of expert opinion services |publisher=Unisearch |accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baxter's biggest clashes with academic staff were over governance issues. He had a preference for industry-style organisation, with clear lines of authority. In 1957, he created a committee of deans, chaired by himself, that met every Wednesday. This became the vice-chancellor's advisory committee in 1960. Through this he created an administrative mechanism which set the university free from the traditional constraints. He did away with the election of deans by the faculty, replacing it with one in which deans were appointed by the University Council on his recommendation. This provided for more efficient administration, but violated the academic tradition of a dean being ''[[primus inter pares]]'' among academic colleagues. This aroused the ire of academic staff, and in the end a compromise was reached whereby each faculty elected a chairman who was responsible for academic matters, while the council appointed a dean who was in charge of administrative matters. This proved to be quite successful, and was retained by Baxter's successors.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; [[Ronald Max Hartwell|Ronald Hartwell]] characterised Baxter's administration as "unusual, undemocratic and unacademic".&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.afterhourschemist.com.au/news/1989/9/6/philip-baxter-atom-bomb-pioneer/ |accessdate=11 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324065220/http://www.afterhourschemist.com.au/news/1989/9/6/philip-baxter-atom-bomb-pioneer/ |archive-date=24 March 2015 |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |title=Philip Baxter, Atom Bomb Pioneer |date= 6 September 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His successor, [[Rupert Myers]], declared that: "History will show Sir Philip Baxter to have been a great educational administrator who built a fine university and made many beneficial changes in the ways universities handled their business and interacted with governments and the community."&lt;ref name="HIFAR"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/portal/system/files/engineering-heritage-australia/nomination-title/HIFAR.pdf |accessdate=11 September 2015 |title=Nomination of the HIFAR Research Reactor as a National Engineering Landmark |publisher=[[Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 August 1949, the Australian government created the Industrial Atomic Energy Policy Committee, chaired by [[Mark Oliphant]] and with Baxter as a member, to advise government on the development of [[nuclear power]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/110551032 |title=Industrial Use of Atomic Energy. |newspaper=[[The Times and Northern Advertiser, Peterborough, South Australia|The Times and Northern Advertiser]]  |date=9 September 1949 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/DetailsReports/AgencyDetail.aspx?reg_no=CA%20343 |publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]] |title=Agency Details – Industrial Atomic Energy Policy Committee |accessdate=12 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the committee's own recommendation, it was superseded by the Atomic Energy Policy Committee in April 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/DetailsReports/AgencyDetail.aspx?reg_no=CA%20332 |publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]] |title=Agency Details –  Atomic Energy Policy Committee |accessdate=12 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn was replaced by the [[Australian Atomic Energy Commission]] (AAEC) in November. The AAEC was run by a three commissioners, with [[Jack Stevens]] as chairman, Baxter as vice-chairman and Hugh Murray from the [[Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company]] as the third member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/DetailsReports/AgencyDetail.aspx?reg_no=CA%20278 |publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]] |title=Agency Details – Atomic Energy Commission |accessdate=12 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAEC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apo.ansto.gov.au/dspace/bitstream/10238/2809/2/First_Ten_Years_1963.pdf  |publisher=[[Australian Atomic Energy Commission]] |first =Philip |last=Baxter |title=The First Ten Years – 1953–1963 |accessdate=12 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baxter succeeded Stevens as chairman in 1957. He worked part-time, spending Fridays at the AAEC until he retired from the UNSW in 1969. Thereafter he was full-time, until he retired from the AAEC on 15 April 1972.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt; He was also the Australian member on the [[Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency|Board of Governors]] of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] when it was created in 1957 and again from 1964 to 1972, serving as its chairman from 1969 to 1970.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

The AAEC established its offices in [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee]].&lt;ref name="AAEC"/&gt; Baxter and Frederick White from the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) visited nuclear facilities in Britain, the United States and Canada in 1953. As there were few people in Australia with nuclear technology experience, he arranged with [[John Cockcroft|Sir John Cockcroft]] for Australians to be seconded to the British [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] in [[Harwell, Oxfordshire|Harwell]]. Some 60 Australian scientists were working there by 1956. During a symposium on "Atomic Power in Australia" held at the New South Wales University of Technology on 31 August and 1 September 1954, Baxter clashed with [[Harry Messel]], the head of the School of Physics at the [[University of Sydney]], over the latter's plans to build a low-power experimental [[nuclear reactor]].&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

[[File:Nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights.jpg|thumb|left|Nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights completed]]
Baxter would have none of it; he wanted a "real reactor, not a low-power toy".&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; He prevailed; the government authorised a [[High Flux Australian Reactor]] (HIFAR).&lt;ref name="AAEC"/&gt; Based on the [[DIDO (nuclear reactor)|DIDO reactor]] at Harwell, HIFAR was cooled and [[neutron moderator|moderated]] by [[heavy water]], and fuelled with [[enriched uranium]].&lt;ref name="HIFAR2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ansto.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/6449/HIFAR_Media_Backgrounder.pdf |title=HIFAR Media Backgrounder |publisher=[[Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation]] |accessdate=12 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began at [[Lucas Heights, New South Wales|Lucas Heights]] in October 1955,&lt;ref name="AAEC"/&gt; and HIFAR went [[Criticality (status)|critical]] on 26 January 1958.&lt;ref name ="HIFAR2"/&gt; By the time he became full-time chairman in 1969, the AAEC had grown to an organisation with a staff of over 1,000 and a budget of $8.5 million.&lt;ref name="HIFAR2"/&gt; The AAEC explored the country looking for uranium deposits, developed technology for uranium enrichment, and produced designs for nuclear reactors.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;

More controversially, Baxter pressed the case for Australia to have the capacity to produce nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Reynolds|2000|pp=145–146}} In 1958, he proposed creating a facility at [[Mount Isa]] to breed [[weapons-grade plutonium]]. His proposals found a sympathetic ear in Prime Minister [[John Gorton]], who approved plans to build a [[CANDU reactor]] at [[Jervis Bay]] in 1969.{{sfn|Clohesy|Deery|2015|pp=228–229}}{{sfn|Reynolds|2000|p=141}}  An access road was built and ground was cleared,&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; but Gorton lost office on 10 March 1971, and the project was suspended, and later cancelled by his successors.{{sfn|Clohesy|Deery|2015|p=232}} Nailing his colours to the mast, Baxter continued his advocacy. In 1975 he declared:{{quote|Over the years I have initially advocated that we should create the necessary technology and industrial background to enable us to move into a nuclear armament quickly. More recently things have changed internationally. I'm now of the opinion that we should begin actively to create nuclear weapons for the defence of Australia.{{sfn|Leah|2014|p=83}} }}

For his work as chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Baxter was made a [[Companion Order of St Michael and St George]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] on 13 June 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1066637&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true |title=Baxter, John Philip – The Order of St Michael and St George – Companion |publisher=It's an Honour |accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was created a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the Civil Division in the [[1965 Queen's Birthday Honours]] on 12 June 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1082139&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true |title=Baxter, John Philip – The Order of the British Empire – Knights Commander |publisher=It's an Honour |accessdate=12 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts and legacy==
[[File:2013AU07.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Sydney Opera House]] ]]
Baxter had been a member of the drama group in Stockton-on-Tees, and had performed on stage with University Drama Club at UNSW, sometimes with his daughter Valerie. In response to a request from the [[Australian Broadcasting Commission]] and the [[Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust]] in 1958 for improved training of actors, he founded the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] (NIDA).&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt; By 2013, NIDA was regarded as one of the world's finest drama schools, with alumni that included [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Judy Davis]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Baz Luhrmann]] and [[Hugo Weaving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/top-25-drama-schools-world-558898 |title=The Top 25 Drama Schools in the World |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=12 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1969 to 1975, Baxter was part-time and unpaid chairman of the [[Sydney Opera House Trust]]. He had recently retired from the UNSW, but the job was no sinecure. The architect, [[Jørn Utzon]], had left, construction was behind schedule and over budget, and specialist staff needed to be recruited. Baxter put the project under his unpopular but decisive grip, and brought the [[Sydney Opera House]] to completion and opening on 20 October 1973.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;

Baxter was awarded honorary doctorates by [[Montreal University]] in 1958, the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] in 1966, the [[University of Queensland]] in 1967, [[Loughborough University]] in 1970 and the UNSW in 1971.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; [[Philip Baxter College, University of New South Wales|Philip Baxter College]] at the UNSW was named after him in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kensingtoncolleges.unsw.edu.au/colleges/philipbaxtercollege/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618150945/http://www.kensingtoncolleges.unsw.edu.au/colleges/philipbaxtercollege/index.html |archive-date=18 June 2016 |title=Kensington Colleges Philip Baxter College| publisher=University of New South Wales |accessdate=12 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in [[Haberfield, New South Wales|Haberfield]] on 5 September 1989, and his remains were cremated. He was survived by three of his children; his wife Lilian had died on 27 July 1989, and his son Peter had died in a motor vehicle accident in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="AAS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; His papers are in the archives at the University of New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/Collections/private_records.html |publisher=University of New South Wales |title=Private Records |accessdate=12 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''portable CD player''' is a [[portable audio player]] used to play [[compact disc]]s. The first audio player released was the [[Discman|Discman D-50]] by [[Sony]].&lt;ref name="aye"&gt;Lungu, R. [http://gadgets.softpedia.com/news/History-of-the-Portable-Audio-Player-046-01.html "History of the Portable Audio Player."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502104636/http://gadgets.softpedia.com/news/History-of-the-Portable-Audio-Player-046-01.html |date=2012-05-02 }} 2008-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
The basic features of a portable CD player are:

#Play/Pause
#Stop
#Rewind
#Fast forward
#Hold (some models)
#[[Liquid crystal display]]
#Headphone/audio out socket

The play and pause feature allows the user to pause in the middle of the track (song) and resume it at the same place the listener left off at once the play button is hit again. The stop feature stops the track allowing the user to then switch tracks easily. The fast forward and rewind feature will either fast forward or rewind the track the amount of time you hold the button down. The liquid crystal display provides a visual of how much battery is left, what track (number) is currently playing, and the amount of time elapsed on the track.  Some portable CD players can play [[CD-R]]/[[CD-RW]] discs and some can play other formats such as [[MP3]]-encoded audio.

The [[Mini CD|8 cm CD]] provides a smaller alternative to the normal 12&amp;nbsp;cm CD (although with a lower capacity). Miniature players exist that only play this format.

== How it works ==
Like a full-size CD player, a portable CD player reads the bumps and grooves using a laser. With its photocell (a device that detects any sort of light reflection given off of certain area), it determines whether there is a reflection of light given off from the CD when the laser hits. Depending on the light reflection, the photocell will return a 1 (if there is no reflection) or a 0 (if there is any light reflection). When its laser hits a groove on a CD, it will not reflect any light, making it a 1. When its laser hits a bump or any other surface on the CD, a light reflection will appear making it a 0. The series of data from 0–1 on the CD is then transformed by a digital to analog converter, to recreate the shape of a [[sound wave]]. The headphones then amplify the sounds and then the audio is now able to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/cd5.htm "How CDs Work"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues with recordable CDs ==
Some portable CD players do not play recordable CDs (CD-R, CD-RW) because of the way these CDs are recorded. A consumer-recorded CD is recorded by making marks in a thin layer of organic dye, which leads to incompatibility with some CD players. For some users of CD-Rs, the solution to this is to burn the CD at a slower speed or use a different brand of recordable CDs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerhope.com/forum/index.php?topic=18461.0 "CD player won't play my burned cds."] 2006-02-17&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future ==
Portable CD players are declining in popularity since the rise in popularity of [[Portable media player]]s that play [[digital audio]] files including the [[iPod]] and [[smartphone]]s. Before digital audio players became popular, many switched over to [[MiniDisc]] as an alternative to CDs, due to the compact size of the MiniDisc format.&lt;ref&gt;Wallop, H.

The '''Poultry Cooperative Research Centre''', or '''Poultry CRC''', is a [[joint venture]] established and supported under the [[Australia]]n Government's [[Cooperative Research Centres]] Program.

The Poultry CRC's major challenge is to help Australia achieve sustainable, ethical poultry production in the face of population growth and climate change.

In July 2008, the Poultry CRC won the World's Poultry Science Association (WPSA) Industry/Organisation Award at the World’s Poultry Congress in Brisbane in recognition of an outstanding contribution to the development of the poultry industry. In August 2012 the Poultry CRC was awarded WPSA's Education Award at the World's Poultry Congress in Brazil for their exceptional contribution to poultry education. In addition, the Poultry CRC received an Australian Collaborative Innovation Award in May 2012.

== Structure of the CRC  ==

The Poultry CRC is an unincorporated joint venture between seven Essential Participants and is governed by a skills-based board. It manages its research and development programs through a public company, Poultry CRC Ltd. The Poultry CRC is headquartered at the [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] in Armidale, New South Wales, and has an extensive collaborative network comprising researchers, educators and support staff from its participating organisations. The original Poultry CRC was established on 1 July 2003, with the current CRC an extension to 2017.

== Poultry CRC Research Programs ==

Three integrated Programs address the major challenge of meeting increasing demand for ‘clean and green’ poultry products and maintaining food security in the face of climate change and population growth.

This requires innovative approaches to:

#maintaining poultry health and enhancing bird welfare;
#improving resource utilisation and reducing environmental impacts of poultry production; and
#controlling poultry product-associated food safety issues and enhancing egg quality for consumers.

'''Program 1 - Health and Welfare''' - aims to maintain a sustainable, healthy and welfare conscious supply of poultry products despite newly emerging pathogens, increasing environmental concerns about production and changing consumer demands. For many diseases, current vaccines fail to offer complete protection. Changes in production, including reduced reliance on antibiotics and increased use of free-range systems, require a complete reconsideration of protection strategies. The CRC brings together the world’s best research and capability providers in diagnostics, animal health products and welfare to develop a holistic solution. This program of highly integrated projects builds on the success of the first CRC while adding key capabilities, such as vaccine delivery methods, mass sequencing of antigens, and therapeutics.

'''Program 2 – Nutrition and Environment''' - addresses resource utilisation and reduction of environmental impacts, including the emission of odours and greenhouse gases (GHG).

'''Program 3 – Safe and Quality Food Production''' - focuses on controlling food-borne illnesses related to poultry products (''i.e.'', ''Campylobacter'' for chicken meat and ''Salmonella'' for eggs) and addresses major consumer dissatisfaction associated with inconsistency in egg quality.

Thirty-five postgraduates are being integrated within the three Programs' research projects, involving immediate and direct interaction with end-users. The CRC expects several to find direct employment with industry, some through its internships program.

'''Retaining walls''' are relatively rigid walls used for supporting the soil mass laterally so that the soil can be retained at different levels on the two sides.
Retaining walls are structures designed to restrain soil to a slope that it would not naturally keep to (typically a steep, near-vertical or vertical slope). They are used to bound soils between two different elevations often in areas of terrain possessing undesirable slopes or in areas where the landscape needs to be shaped severely and engineered for more specific purposes like hillside farming or roadway overpasses.

==Definition==
A retaining wall is a structure designed and constructed to resist the lateral pressure of soil, when there is a desired change in ground elevation that exceeds the [[angle of repose]] of the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Ching, F. D., Faia., R., S., &amp; Winkel, P. (2006). ''Building Codes Illustrated: A Guide to Understanding the 2006 International Building Code'' (2 ed.). New York, NY: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

A basement wall is thus one kind of retaining wall.  But the term usually refers to a cantilever retaining wall, which is a freestanding structure without lateral support at its top.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, J. (1991). ''Simplified Design of Masonry Structures''. New York: John Wiley and Sons, Inc. pp. 70–75. {{ISBN|0471179884}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These are cantilevered from a footing and rise above the grade on one side to retain a higher level grade on the opposite side. The walls must resist the lateral pressures generated by loose soils or, in some cases, [[hydrostatic pressure|water pressures]].&lt;ref&gt;Crosbie, M. &amp; Watson, D. (Eds.). (2005). ''Time-Saver Standards for Architectural Design.'' New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Terminology.jpg|thumb]]

Every retaining wall supports a "wedge" of [[soil]]. The wedge is defined as the soil which extends beyond the failure plane of the soil type present at the wall site, and can be calculated once the [[angle of repose|soil friction]] angle is known. As the setback of the wall increases, the size of the sliding wedge is reduced. This reduction lowers the pressure on the retaining wall.&lt;ref&gt;(2011) Commercial Installation Manual for Allan Block Retaining Walls (p. 13)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important consideration in proper design and installation of retaining walls is to recognize and counteract the tendency of the retained material to move downslope due to [[gravity]]. This creates [[lateral earth pressure]] behind the wall which depends on the [[angle]] of internal [[friction]] (phi) and the cohesive strength (c) of the retained material, as well as the direction and magnitude of movement the retaining structure undergoes.

Lateral earth pressures are zero at the top of the wall and – in homogenous ground – increase proportionally to a maximum value at the lowest depth. Earth pressures will push the wall forward or overturn it if not properly addressed. Also, any [[groundwater]] behind the wall that is not dissipated by a [[drainage]] system causes [[hydrostatic pressure]] on the wall. The total pressure or thrust may be assumed to act at one-third from the lowest depth for lengthwise stretches of uniform height.&lt;ref name="retaining-wall-tests"&gt;
{{cite book| last = Terzaghi| first = K.| author-link = Karl von Terzaghi| title = Large Retaining Wall Tests| publisher = Engineering News Record Feb. 1, March 8, April 19 | year = 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless the wall is designed to retain water, It is important to have proper drainage behind the wall in order to limit the pressure to the wall's design value. Drainage materials will reduce or eliminate the hydrostatic pressure and improve the stability of the material behind the wall. [[Drystone]] retaining walls are normally self-draining.

As an example, the [[International Building Code]] requires retaining walls to be designed to ensure stability against overturning, sliding, excessive [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] pressure and water uplift; and that they be designed for a [[safety factor]] of 1.5 against lateral sliding and overturning.&lt;ref&gt;2006 International Building Code Section 1806.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

[[File:Retaining Wall Type Function.jpg|840px|thumb|center|Various types of retaining walls]]

===Gravity===

[[File:Gravity Walls.jpg|thumb|Construction types of gravity retaining walls]]

Gravity walls depend on their mass (stone, concrete or other heavy material) to resist pressure from behind and may have a &lt;!-- "batter" is NOT A TYPO --&gt;'batter' setback to improve stability by leaning back toward the retained soil. For short landscaping walls, they are often made from [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]]less stone or segmental concrete units (masonry units).&lt;ref name="SEG"&gt;{{cite web| title = Segmental Retaining Walls| publisher = [[National Concrete Masonry Association]]| url = http://www.ncma.org/use/srw.html| accessdate = 2008-03-24 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073923/http://www.ncma.org/use/srw.html |archivedate = 2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dry-stacked gravity walls are somewhat flexible and do not require a rigid footing.

Earlier in the 20th century, taller retaining walls were often gravity walls made from large masses of concrete or stone. Today, taller retaining walls are increasingly built as composite gravity walls such as: geosynthetics such as geocell cellular confinement earth retention  or with precast facing; [[gabion]]s (stacked steel wire baskets filled with rocks); crib walls (cells built up log cabin style from precast concrete or timber and filled with granular material); or soil-nailed walls (soil reinforced in place with steel and concrete rods).&lt;ref name="soil-mechanics"&gt;{{cite book| last = Terzaghi| first = K.| author-link = Karl von Terzaghi| title = Theoretical Soil Mechanics| place = New York| publisher = John Wiley and Sons| year=1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cantilevered===

[[File:Counterfort.jpg|thumb|Counterfort/Buttress on Cantilevered Wall]]
Cantilevered retaining walls are made from an internal stem of steel-reinforced, cast-in-place concrete or mortared masonry (often in the shape of an inverted T). These walls cantilever loads (like a [[beam (structure)|beam]]) to a large, structural footing, converting horizontal pressures from behind the wall to vertical pressures on the ground below. Sometimes cantilevered walls are buttressed on the front, or include a [[Buttress|counterfort]] on the back, to improve their strength resisting high loads. Buttresses are short [[wing wall]]s at right angles to the main trend of the wall. These walls require rigid concrete footings below seasonal frost depth.  This type of wall uses much less material than a traditional gravity wall.

[[File:Spundwand.jpg|thumb|Sheet pile wall]]
Sheet pile retaining walls are usually used in soft soil and tight spaces. Sheet pile walls are made out of steel, vinyl or wood planks which are driven into the ground. For a quick estimate the material is usually driven 1/3 above ground, 2/3 below ground, but this may be altered depending on the environment. Taller sheet pile walls will need a tie-back [[Earth anchor|anchor]], or "dead-man" placed in the soil a distance behind the face of the wall, that is tied to the wall, usually by a cable or a rod. [[Earth anchor|Anchors]] are then placed behind the potential failure plane in the soil.

===Bored pile ===

Bored pile retaining walls are built by assembling a sequence of [[bored pile]]s, proceeded by excavating away the excess soil.  
Depending on the project, the bored pile retaining wall may include a series of [[earth anchor]]s, reinforcing beams, soil improvement operations and [[shotcrete]] reinforcement layer.
This construction technique tends to be employed in scenarios where sheet piling is a valid construction solution, but where the vibration or noise levels generated by a [[pile driver]] are not acceptable.

===Anchored===

{{See also|Tieback (geotechnical)}}

[[File:Anchored wall.jpg|thumb|Anchored wall in the mountainous region of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro state]], Brazil]]
An anchored retaining wall can be constructed in any of the aforementioned styles but also includes additional strength using cables or other stays anchored in the rock or soil behind it. Usually driven into the material with boring, anchors are then expanded at the end of the cable, either by mechanical means or often by injecting [[Shotcrete|pressurized concrete]], which expands to form a bulb in the soil. Technically complex, this method is very useful where high loads are expected, or where the wall itself has to be slender and would otherwise be too weak.

==Alternative retaining techniques==

===Soil nailing===

{{main|Soil nailing}}
Soil nailing is a technique in which soil slopes, [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavations]] or retaining walls are reinforced by the insertion of relatively slender elements – normally steel reinforcing bars. The bars are usually installed into a pre-drilled hole and then [[grout]]ed into place or drilled and grouted simultaneously. They are usually installed untensioned at a slight downward inclination. A rigid or flexible facing (often sprayed concrete) or isolated soil nail heads may be used at the surface.

===Soil-strengthened===
A number of systems exist that do not consist of just the wall, but reduce the earth pressure acting directly on the wall. These are usually used in combination with one of the other wall types, though some may only use it as facing, ''i.e.'', for visual purposes.

====Gabion meshes====
{{Main|Gabion}}
This type of soil strengthening, often also used without an outside wall, consists of [[wire]] [[mesh]] "boxes", which are filled with roughly cut stone or other material. The mesh cages reduce some internal movement and forces, and also reduce erosive forces. 
Gabion walls are free-draining retaining structures and as such are often built in locations where ground water is present. However, management and control of the ground water in and around all retaining walls is important.

===Mechanical stabilization===

{{main|Mechanically stabilized earth}}

Mechanically stabilized earth, also called MSE, is soil constructed with artificial reinforcing via layered horizontal mats ([[geosynthetics]]) fixed at their ends. These mats provide added internal shear resistance beyond that of simple gravity wall structures. Other options include steel straps, also layered. This type of soil strengthening usually needs outer facing walls (S.R.W.'s – Segmental Retaining Walls) to affix the layers to and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://geostone.com/CAD/8vs4-16ft_batter.jpg JPG image]. geostone.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The wall face is often of precast concrete units&lt;ref name="SEG"/&gt; that can tolerate some differential movement. The reinforced soil's mass, along with the facing, then acts as an improved gravity wall. The reinforced mass must be built large enough to retain the pressures from the soil behind it. Gravity walls usually must be a minimum of 50 to 60 percent as deep or thick as the height of the wall, and may have to be larger if there is a slope or surcharge on the wall.

[[Cellular confinement systems|Cellular confinement systems (geocells)]] are also used for steep earth stabilization in gravity and reinforced retaining walls with geogrids. Geocell retaining walls are structurally stable under self- weight and externally imposed loads, while the flexibility of the structure offers very high seismic resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leshchinsky, D. |year=2009|url=http://geosyntheticsmagazine.com/2009/08/01/research-and-innovation-seismic-performance-of-various-geocell-earth-retention-systems/|title=Research and Innovation: Seismic Performance of Various Geocell Earth-retention Systems|journal=Geosysnthetics|volume= 27|issue= 4|pages= 46–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outer fascia cells of the wall can be planted with vegetation to create a [[green wall]].

A '''retention basin,''' sometimes called a '''wet pond,''' '''wet [[detention basin]]''' or '''stormwater management pond,''' is an artificial lake with vegetation around the perimeter, and includes a permanent pool of water in its design&lt;ref&gt;[http://wef.org Water Environment Federation], Alexandria, VA; and [http://www.asce.org American Society of Civil Engineers], Reston, VA. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdU-VXXV_H0C "Urban Runoff Quality Management."] WEF Manual of Practice No.  23; ASCE Manual and Report on Engineering Practice No.  87. 1998. {{ISBN|1-57278-039-8}}. Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, D.C. [https://www.epa.gov/eg/industrial-wastewater-studies-miscellaneous "Preliminary Data Summary of Urban Storm Water Best Management Practices."] Chapter 5. August 1999. Document No. EPA-821-R-99-012.&lt;/ref&gt;'''&lt;ref&gt;University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. "If you build it they will come: Frogs flourish in humanmade ponds." ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 27 August 2015. &lt;www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/08/150827154644.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;'''. It is used to manage [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] to prevent [[flood]]ing and downstream [[erosion]], and improve [[water quality]] in an adjacent [[river]], [[stream]], [[lake]] or [[bay]].  

It is distinguished from a [[detention basin]], sometimes called a "dry pond", which temporarily stores water after a storm, but eventually empties out at a controlled rate to a downstream water body.  It also differs from an [[infiltration basin]] which is designed to direct stormwater to [[groundwater]] through permeable soils.

Wet ponds are frequently used for water quality improvement, [[groundwater recharge]], flood protection, aesthetic improvement or any combination of these.  Sometimes they act as a replacement for the natural absorption of a forest or other natural process that was lost when an area is developed.  As such, these structures are designed to blend into neighborhoods and viewed as an amenity.&lt;ref&gt;Mississippi State University. College of Engineering. [http://www.abe.msstate.edu/csd/p-dm/all-chapters/chapter4/chapter4/srb1.pdf Stormwater Retention Basins. Chapter 4, Best Management Practices.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In urban areas, [[impervious surface]]s (roofs, roads) reduce the time spent by rainfall before entering into the stormwater drainage system.  If left unchecked, this will cause widespread flooding downstream.  The function of a stormwater pond is to contain this surge and release it slowly.  This slow release mitigates the size and intensity of storm-induced flooding on downstream receiving waters. Stormwater ponds also collect suspended sediments, which are often found in high concentrations in stormwater water due to upstream construction and sand applications to roadways.

==Design features==
Storm water is typically channeled to a retention basin through a system of street and/or [[parking lot]] [[storm drain]]s, and a network of drain channels or underground pipes. The basins are designed to allow relatively large flows of water to enter, but discharges to receiving waters are limited by outlet structures that function only during very large storm events.

Retention ponds are often landscaped with a variety of [[grass]]es, [[shrub]]s and/or [[wetland]] plants to provide bank stability and aesthetic benefits.  Vegetation also provides water quality benefits by removing soluble nutrients through uptake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udfcd.org Urban Drainage &amp; Flood Control District], Denver, CO.  [http://www.udfcd.org/downloads/pdf/critmanual/Volume%203%20PDFs/04%20Structural%20BMP%202008-04%20rev.pdf Urban Storm Drainage Criteria Manual. Volume 3, Structural BMPs.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731053100/http://www.udfcd.org/downloads/pdf/critmanual/Volume%203%20PDFs/04%20Structural%20BMP%202008-04%20rev.pdf |date=2009-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some areas the ponds can attract nuisance types of wildlife like ducks or [[Canada goose|Canada geese]], particularly where there is minimal landscaping and grasses are mowed.  This reduces the ability of [[fox]]es, [[coyote]]s and other [[predator]]s to approach their prey unseen. Such predators tend to hide in the cattails and other tall, thick grass surrounding natural water features.

Depth of retention ponds is of critical importance, for removal of pollutants and the volume of fish that could be inhabiting the pond.  [[Urban fishing]] continues to be one of the fastest growing fishing segments as new suburban neighbourhoods are built around these aquatic areas

==Other meanings==
A retention basin can also be a part of a [[nuclear reactor]] used to contain a core meltdown.

A '''reverse-contrast''' letterform is a [[typeface]] or custom [[lettering]] in which the [[stress (font)|stress]] is reversed from the norm: instead of the vertical lines being the same width or thicker than horizontals, which is normal in [[Latin-alphabet]] writing and especially printing, the horizontal lines are the thickest.&lt;ref name="Type Tuesday Eye"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barnes &amp; Schwarz|title=Type Tuesday|url=http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/type-tuesday13|website=[[Eye (magazine)|Eye magazine]]|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Chosen Contrast"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abel|first1=Naomi|title=The Chosen Contrast|url=http://www.alphabettes.org/the-chosen-contrast/|website=Alphabettes|accessdate=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A Short History of the Italian"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shields|first1=David|title=A Short History of the Italian|journal=Ultrabold|date=2008|issue=4|pages=22-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a dramatic effect, in which the letters seem to have been printed the wrong way round. Originally invented in the early nineteenth century as attention-grabbing novelty display designs, modern font designer [[Peter Biľak]], who has created a design in the genre, has described them as "a dirty trick to create freakish letterforms that stood out."&lt;ref name="Beauty and Ugliness in Type design" /&gt;

Reverse-contrast letters are rarely used for body text, being more used in [[Display typeface|display]] applications such as headings and posters, in which the unusual structure may be particularly eye-catching.&lt;ref name="Anatomy of a typeface"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawson|first1=Alexander|title=Anatomy of a Typeface|date=1990|publisher=Godine|location=Boston|isbn=9780879233334|pages=321–323|edition=1st&lt;!--|accessdate=23 October 2015--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were particularly common in the nineteenth century, and have been revived occasionally since then. They could be considered as [[slab serif]] designs because of the thickened serifs, and are often characterised as part of that genre.

The reverse-contrast effect has been extended to other kinds of typeface, such as [[sans-serif]] designs and designs more suitable for extended text passages.&lt;ref name="A Short History of the Italian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fontlists: reverse contrast"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peters|first1=Yves|title=Fontlists: Reverse Contrast|url=https://www.fontshop.com/people/yves-peters/fontlists/reverse-contrast|website=Fontshop|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design style, also known as "reverse-stroke" or "horizontal-stress", has no connection to reverse-contrast ''printing'', where light text is printed on a black background.&lt;ref name="Osborne2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Osborne|title=Health Literacy From A to Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a9mnNKpOWPkC&amp;pg=PA211|date=18 November 2012|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-1-4496-7734-3|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
{{see also|Didone (typography)|label 1=Didone typefaces}}
[[File:01 Humanística.svg|thumb|Diagonal angle of stress in the typeface [[Centaur (typeface)|Centaur]], based on 1470s Venetian printing. The narrowest part of the stroke is at top left/bottom right, so the axis is diagonal.]]
Throughout the development of the modern [[Latin alphabet]] with an upper-case based on [[Roman square capitals]] and lower-case based on [[handwriting]], it has been the norm for the vertical lines to generally be slightly thicker than the horizontals. Early 'roman' or '[[Antiqua (typeface class)|antiqua]]' type followed this model, often placing the thinnest point of letters at an angle and downstrokes heavier than upstrokes, mimicking the writing of a right-handed writer holding a [[quill pen]]. (The [[Hebrew alphabet]], in contrast, is normally "reverse-contrast" from a Latin-alphabet perspective, as the verticals are lighter.&lt;ref name="Abel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abel|first1=Naomi|title=Chosen Contrast|url=http://www.alphabettes.org/the-chosen-contrast/|website=Alphabettes|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

From the arrival of [[roman type]] around 1475 to the late eighteenth century, relatively little development in letter design took place, as most fonts of the period were intended for body text, and they stayed relatively similar in design and rooted in traditions of Italian humanistic handwriting.{{efn|This was not the only way in which fonts could appear different, however: differences in [[x-height]], spacing, condensation and [[Type color|colour on the page]] can make body text fonts look different in design even if individual letters are not that different.}}
[[File:04 Didona.svg|thumb|A Didone type, [[Bodoni]], from the late eighteenth century. The contrast has been increased and the axis of the contrast made more purely vertical.]]
[[File:05 Egípcia.svg|thumb|A conventional slab-serif typeface, [[Rockwell (typeface)|Rockwell]].{{efn|Rockwell is actually from the 1930s, but early slab-serif typefaces were very similar.&lt;ref name="Sentinel: history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sentinel's Ancestors|url=http://www.typography.com/fonts/sentinel/history/|publisher=Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones|accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The serifs have been thickened and the contrast is minimal.]]

Starting in the eighteenth century, typefounders developed what are now called [[Serif#Transitional|transitional]] and then [[Didone (typography)|Didone]] types.{{efn|Some elements of what became transitional typefaces appeared from the very late seventeenth century, as lettering and from the groundbreaking [[Romain du Roi]] alphabet of the French crown, but generally typefounders stayed using typefaces of conservative design into the eighteenth century.}} These typefaces had a far greater amount of stroke contrast than before, with the difference in stroke width much greater than in earlier types.{{efn|Didone types were at the time called 'modern' for their sophisticated image; the name has fallen from use as they have become less common in body text from around the end of the nineteenth century.}}&lt;ref name="Transitional &amp; Modern Type Families"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phinney|first1=Thomas|title=Transitional &amp; Modern Type Families|url=http://www.graphic-design.com/typography/design/transitional-modern-type-families|website=Graphic Design &amp; Publishing Center|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Cees W. |last1= De Jong |first2= Alston W. |last2= Purvis |first3= Friedrich |last3=  Friedl |last-author-amp= yes |year= 2005 |title= Creative Type: A Sourcebook of Classical and Contemporary Letterforms |publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson |page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Didot history HFJ"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hoefler|first1=Jonathan|title=Didot History|url=http://www.typography.com/fonts/didot/history/|publisher=Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These had more constructed letterforms, matching the steely calligraphy of the period, and daringly slender horizontals and serif details that could show off the increasingly high quality of paper and printing technology of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Meggs |first1=  Philip B. |last2= Purvis |first2=  Alston W. |last-author-amp= yes |chapter= Graphic Design and the Industrial Revolution |title= History of Graphic Design |location= Hoboken, NJ |publisher= Wiley |year= 2006 |page= 122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sutton|first= James | last2 = Sutton|first2= Alan |last-author-amp= yes | title=An Atlas of Typeforms | publisher=Wordsworth Editions | year=1988 | page=59 | isbn=1-85326-911-5 | url=http://openlibrary.org/b/OL22453920M}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, these typefaces had a strictly vertical stress: without exception, the vertical lines were thicker than the horizontals, creating a much more geometric and modular design.

A second major development of the period was the arrival of the printed poster and increasing use of signpainting and printing for publicity and advertising material, for example in newspaper adverts. This caused a desire to develop eye-catching new types of letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eskilson|first1=Stephen J.|title=Graphic Design: A New History|date=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=9780300120110|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, new styles of lettering and "[[Display typeface|display type]]" began to appear, such as "fat face" bold faces, [[sans serif]] letters, apparently inspired by classical antiquity, and then [[slab-serif]]s.&lt;ref name="The nymph and the grot: the revival of the sanserif letter"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mosley|first1=James|title=The Nymph and the Grot: the Revival of the Sanserif Letter|date=1999|publisher=Friends of the St Bride Printing Library|location=London|pages=1–19|isbn=9780953520107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fat faces Phinney"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phinney|first1=Thomas|title=Fat Faces|url=http://graphic-design.com/typography/design/decorative-display-typestyles|publisher=Graphic Design and Publishing Centre|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote= It became clear that in 1805 Egyptian [sans-serif] letters were happening in the streets of London, being plastered over shops and on walls by signwriters, and they were astonishing the public, who had never seen letters like them and were not sure they wanted to.|last= Mosley |first= James|author-link=James Mosley|title= The Nymph and the Grot, an Update |url= http://typefoundry.blogspot.co.uk/2007/01/nymph-and-grot-update.html|date= 6 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English Vernacular"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mosley|first1=James|title=English Vernacular|journal=Motif|date=1963|volume=11|pages=3-56|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English vernacular (2006)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mosley|first1=James|title=English vernacular (2006)|url=http://typefoundry.blogspot.co.uk/2006/02/english-vernacular.html|website=Type Foundry (blog)|accessdate=21 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These letterforms were a new departure and not simply larger versions of traditional serif letters.&lt;ref name="Scrambled Eggs &amp; Serifs"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frere-Jones|first1=Tobias|title=Scrambled Eggs &amp; Serifs|url=http://www.frerejones.com/blog/scrambled-eggs-and-serifs/|publisher=Frere-Jones Type|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The history and technique of lettering"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nesbitt|first1=Alexander|title=The History and Technique of Lettering|date=1998|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, NY|isbn=9780486402819|pages=158–161&lt;!--|accessdate=23 October 2015--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably to be more eye-catching, these new styles of letter were often extremely bold.&lt;ref name="The Story of Our Friend, the Fat Face"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kennard|first1=Jennifer|title=The Story of Our Friend, the Fat Face|url=http://fontsinuse.com/uses/5578/the-story-of-our-friend-the-fat-face|website=Fonts in Use|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known reverse contrast typeface dates to about 1821. It was created by the H.W. Caslon company in London, presumably as a parody of the crisp, high-contrast "Didone" typefaces and lettering of the period.&lt;ref name="Type Tuesday Eye"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beauty and Ugliness in Type design" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnes Twitter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barnes|first1=Paul|title=Twitter post|url=https://twitter.com/PauloBarnesi/status/753127753738809344?lang=en-gb|website=Twitter|accessdate=1 August 2016|quote=[Nicolete] Gray says it was Italian in origin (via France), though I've never seen French or Italian sources...I am unsure of the full story}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Henry Caslon Devroye"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devroye|first1=Luc|title=Henry Caslon|url=http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-54976.html|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Heller|editor-first1= Steven|editor-last2=Meggs|editor-first2=Philip B.|last-author-amp= yes |title=Texts on Type: Critical Writings on Typography|date=2001|publisher=Allworth Press|location=New York|isbn=9781581150827|page=71&lt;!--|accessdate=23 October 2015--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conceptual Type" /&gt; A caps-only design, the foundry's steel master [[Punchcutting|punches]] survive in the collection of the [[St Bride Library]], London.&lt;ref name="Type Tuesday Eye" /&gt;{{efn|Barnes and Schwartz show images of surviving punches for the Five Lines Pica size from the 1830s, which was not the first size to be released.&lt;ref name="Type Tuesday Eye" /&gt;}} [[Nicolete Gray]], quoting French historian [[Francis Thibaudeau]], wrote in ''Nineteenth Century Ornamented Typefaces'' that the style appeared (presumably as lettering) in France slightly earlier during the [[First French Empire]] (1804-1815).&lt;ref name="Nineteenth-century Ornamented Typefaces"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Nicolete|title=Nineteenth-century Ornamented Typefaces|date=1976|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Caslon company called the type ''Italian''. Gray proposes that the style was "probably" Italian in origin, although it was certainly very common for display types to be given unusual, exotic names as a brand; for example, "Egyptian" was often applied to sans- (and then slab-) serif types of the period and "Antique" to slab-serifs.&lt;ref name="Scrambled Eggs &amp; Serifs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nineteenth-century Ornamented Typefaces" /&gt; Reverse-contrast designs do slightly resemble ''[[capitalis rustica]]'' writing from Ancient Rome, which also has emphatic horizontal serifs at top and bottom, although this may be a coincidence.&lt;ref name="Adrian Frutiger (on Westside)" /&gt; Other names such as ''Egyptian'' were also used.&lt;ref name="Beauty and Ugliness in Type design"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Biľak|first1=Peter|title=Beauty and Ugliness in Type design|url=http://ilovetypography.com/2012/09/25/beauty-and-ugliness-in-type-font-design/|website=I love typography|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vinne, Theodore Low 1902, p. 333"&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Vinne|first1=Theodore|title=The Practice of Typography, Plain Printing Types|date=1902|publisher=The Century Co|location=New York|pages=333–334|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/details/practiceoftyppla00deviuoft|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding design, the Caslon Italian typeface is very clearly "conceptual" in design, deliberately taking aspects of the fat face and one by one inverting them. It has very thick [[serif]]s, so the gap between the serifs and the main strokes making up the letters is very small, as can be seen on letters such as 'E' and 'S'. To make the effect even more shocking, the triangular serifs were inverted (becoming thinner as they met the letter, not thicker), and the thicker line on the 'A' was moved from its normal position on the right (the natural position matching the handwriting of a right-handed writer) to the left, making a letter that seems to have been drawn the wrong way round. Writing for [[Print (magazine)|''Print'']] magazine, [[Paul Shaw (design historian)|Paul Shaw]] described it as "one of the most bizarre slab serif types of the 19th century."&lt;ref name="Arbor, a Fresh Interpretation of Caslon Italian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Arbor, a Fresh Interpretation of Caslon Italian|url=http://www.printmag.com/imprint/arbor-review/|website=Print|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Slab-serif letterforms were new at the time.

Within a few years of their introduction the printer and social reformer [[Thomas Curson Hansard]] had described them as "typographic monstrosities":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Fashion and Fancy commonly frolic from one extreme to another. To the razor-edged fine lines and serifs of [Didone] type...a reverse [of [[Sans-serif|sans]] and [[slab serif]]s] has succeeded...the property of which is, that the strokes which form the letters are all of one uniform thickness! After this, who would have thought that further extravagance could have been conceived? It remains, however, to be stated, that the ingenuity of one founder has contrived a type in which the natural shape is reversed, by turning all the serifs and fine strokes into fats, and the fats into leans. Oh! sacred shades of ''[eminent typefounders of the past]'' [[Joseph Moxon|Moxon]] and [[:fr:Christoffel van Dijck|van Dijck]], of [[John Baskerville|Baskerville]] and [[Giambattista Bodoni|Bodoni]]!

In contrast, [[Walter Tracy]] described the design in 1986 as "a [[jeu d’esprit]], not meant to be judged in conventional aesthetic terms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tracy|first1=Walter|title=Letters of Credit: A View of Type Design|date=2003|publisher=David R.

The design was apparently successful, since it rapidly spread to the United States and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="A Short History of the Italian" /&gt; For example, the George Bruce company of New York displays Caslon's Italian (or a close copy) in its 1828 specimen book.&lt;ref name="A Specimen Book of Printing Types 1828"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Specimen Book of Printing Types|date=1828|publisher=George Bruce|location=New York|url=http://www.circuitousroot.com/artifice/letters/press/noncomptype/typography/bruce/index.html|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many versions of similar design were released, both as metal and as wood type.&lt;ref name="Shaw2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Shaw|title=Revival Type: Digital Typefaces Inspired by the Past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n7e0DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA123|date=April 2017|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-21929-6|pages=123–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Other digitised specimen books of the period showing Italians are Caslon 1841,&lt;ref name="Specimen of Printing Types by Henry Caslon 1841"&gt;{{cite book|title=Specimen of Printing Types by Henry Caslon|date=1841|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LVsJAAAAQAAJ|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce 1869,&lt;ref name="Bruce 1869"&gt;{{cite book|title=An Abridged Specimen of Printing Types: Made at Bruce's New York Type-foundry|date=1869|publisher=G.

[[Peter Biľak]]'s Karloff is a sophisticated revival of the original reverse-contrast faces designed partly through mathematical interpolation. Biľak's group digitally inverted the contrast of a conventional Didone font: this allowed Biľak to create a family of normal and matching reverse-contrast fonts with upper- and lower-case, together with a low-contrast slab serif design, all with the same basic structure. These have been released as Karloff Positive, Negative and Neutral, the name referring to [[Boris Karloff]].&lt;ref name="Beauty and Ugliness in Type design" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Conceptual Type"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Biľak|first1=Peter|title=Conceptual Type|url=https://www.typotheque.com/articles/conceptual_type|website=Typotheque|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Karloff review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shinn|first1=Nick|title=Karloff Review|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/karloff/|website=Typographica|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Karloff Positive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Karloff Positive|url=https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/karloff_positive|website=Typotheque|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Village Type's Arbor like Karloff adds a lower-case, while Match &amp; Kerosene's Slab Sheriff is caps-only, with a 'A' featuring the conventional stress on the right.&lt;ref name="Slab Sheriff"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheldon|first1=Alex|title=Slab Sheriff|url=https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/matchandkerosene/slab-sheriff/|website=MyFonts|publisher=Match and Kerosene|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arbor&gt;{{cite web|title=Arbor|url=https://vllg.com/constellation/arbor|publisher=Village Type|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revival with extremely high contrast is Kris Sowersby's Maelstrom.&lt;ref name="Bantjes Maelstrom"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bantjes|first1=Marian|title=Maelstrom|url=http://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/maelstrom/|website=Typographica|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Font Review Journal Maelstrom review"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Heck |first1=Bethany |title=Review: Maelstrom |url=http://fontreviewjournal.com/maelstrom/ |website=Font Review Journal |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maelstrom Design Information"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sowersby |first1=Kris |title=Maelstrom Design Information |url=https://klim.co.nz/blog/maelstrom-design-information/ |publisher=Klim Type Foundry |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other unreleased revivals have reportedly been made for private use by [[Paul Barnes (designer)|Paul Barnes]] and [[Justin Howes]].&lt;ref name="Caslon’s Italian by James Clough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul Barnes Caslon Italian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barnes|first1=Paul|title=Caslon Italian|url=http://www.moderntypography.com/Typedesign/Classics/CaslonItalian/index.html|accessdate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reverse-contrast idea fused with a separate genre of slab-serif face, known as [[Clarendon (typeface)|Clarendons]]. In the mid to late nineteenth century, it became popular for type foundries to offer reverse-contrast variants of Clarendon, a popular slab serif type genre, especially in the [[United States]], creating large block serifs at the top and bottom of the letter. This was known as "French Clarendon" type.&lt;ref name="Provan, Archie 1983, pp. 20-21"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Provan |first1= Archie |first2= Alexander S. |last2= Lawson |last-author-amp= yes |title= 100 Type Histories |volume= volume 1 |publisher= National Composition Association |location= Arlington, VA |year= 1983 |pages= 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="P.T.

Barnum|date = |accessdate = |website = MyFonts|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of French Clarendon type was that it allowed very large, eye-catching serifs while the letters remained narrow, suiting the desire of poster-makers for condensed but very bold type.&lt;ref name="Know your type: Clarendon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Challand|first1=Skylar|title=Know Your Type: Clarendon|url=http://idsgn.org/posts/know-your-type-clarendon/|publisher=IDSGN|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; French Clarendon designs were often created in wood type, used for large-print letters on posters. They are often associated with "wild-west" printing and seen on circus posters and wanted notices in western movies, although the style was really used in many parts of the world during this period. The style is sometimes called 'circus letter'.&lt;ref name="Anatomy of a typeface" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Provan, Archie 1983, pp. 20-21"/&gt; The practice was less popular with more artisanal printers: [[Theodore Low De Vinne|DeVinne]] commented in 1902 that "To be hated, it needs but to be seen."&lt;ref name="Vinne, Theodore Low 1902, p. 333"/&gt; In Europe the style was sometimes called Italienne, matching the Caslon name. In contrast to the original Caslon type, which features horizontals in the middle of the letter (like the cross-bar in the H) that are often but not always thick, French Clarendon types have the only thick lines at the top and botton, and all inner horizontals thin, and are generally less "conceptually" reverse-contrast, with serifs in a more conventional alignment apart from the thick strokes at top and bottom.&lt;ref name="Adrian Frutiger (on Westside)" /&gt;
{{Quote box
 |quote  = Although Bodoni and Didot fuelled their designs with the calligraphic practices of their time, they created new forms that collided with typographic tradition and unleashed a strange new world, where the structural attributes of the letter-serif and stem, thick and thin strokes, vertical and horizontal stress-would be subject to bizarre experiments...Fonts of astonishing height, width and depth appeared: expanded, contracted, shadowed, inlined, fattened, faceted and floriated. Serifs abandoned their role as finishing details to become independent architectural structures, and the vertical stress of traditional letters canted in new directions.&lt;ref name="Thinking with Type 23" /&gt;

A variety of more modern adaptations have been made of the style, including [[Robert Harling (typographer)|Robert Harling]]'s Playbill (1938)  and more recently [[Adrian Frutiger]]'s Westside, [[URW++]]'s Zirkus and Bitstream's P. T. Barnum.&lt;ref name="Adrian Frutiger (on Westside)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frutiger, Osterer &amp; Stamm|title=Adrian Frutiger&amp;nbsp;– Typefaces: The Complete Works|date=2014|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783038212607|pages=346–351}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="P.T.

Writing on why he created a design in the genre, Frutiger, a designer better-known for his work in the [[sans-serif]] genre, commented:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As a type designer I wanted to draw something in every style. It's a matter of professional pride...I found the existing Italiennes with their big feet too harsh and strict...the fine curves in the serifs give ''Westside'' its own expression. A text set in this typeface looks like a weaving pattern...I really enjoyed drawing it. For one thing it was great fun.&lt;ref name="Adrian Frutiger (on Westside)" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Frutiger decided to return to the Caslon type's pattern of all horizontals being thick apart from those on 'a' and 'e', which he felt could not be fitted into this system.

Because of their quirky, hand-made design, lighter versions of the French Clarendon style were popular for uses such as film posters in the 1950s and '60s.&lt;ref name="Backasswards!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1299">The '''roadometer''' was a 19th-century device like an [[odometer]] for measuring mileage, towed by a wagon, invented in 1847 by [[William Clayton (Mormon)|William Clayton]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mormonwiki.com/William_Clayton William Clayton] from mormonwiki.com, accessed December 18, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Orson Pratt]], [[Mormon]] pioneers.&lt;ref name=farmcollector&gt;[http://www.farmcollector.com/equipment/roadometer-counted-settlers-distance-traveled.aspx  Roadometer Counted Settlers’ Distance Traveled] from farmcollector.com accessed December 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The roadometer invented by William Clayton and Orson Pratt had cogs and gears made of wood. It recorded wheel revolutions by the mile and quarter-mile. They used their invention to provide an estimate of the distance their party traveled each day between Omaha, Nebraska, and [[Salt Lake City]], Utah.&lt;ref name=farmcollector/&gt; Subsequently in 1849, it was attached to the wagon of [[Addison Pratt]], to be used to record the daily mileage of the [[Jefferson Hunt]] wagon train that pioneered the [[Mormon Road]] from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles.

A '''secretary desk''' or '''escritoire''' is made of a base of wide drawers topped by a desk with a hinged desktop surface, which is in turn topped by a [[bookcase]] usually closed with a pair of doors, often made of glass.  The whole is usually a single, tall and heavy piece of furniture.
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Secretarydeskside20050410.jpg|thumb|right|225px|]] --&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Secretarydeskfront20050410.png|thumb|right|Secretary desk]]
Like the [[slant top desk]], the main work surface is a hinged piece of wood which is flat when open and oblique when raised to enclose secondary work surfaces such as small shelves, small drawers and nooks  stacked in front of the user. Thus, like the [[Wooton desk]], the [[fall front desk]] and others with a hinged desktop, and unlike closable desks with an unmovable desktop like the [[rolltop desk]] or the [[cylinder desk]] all documents and various items must be removed from the work surface before closing up.

When closed, the secretary desk looks like a cross between a commode-dresser, a [[slant top desk]] and a book case.  The secretary is one of the most common [[Antiques|antique]] desk forms and has been endlessly reproduced and copied for home use in the last hundred years. Among home desk forms, it is the tallest, biggest and heaviest, excluding wall units and modular desks which typically can be disassembled for moving, or some of the biggest of the [[armoire desk]]s, which are usually delivered unassembled.

The desk described here is most correctly{{According to whom|date=December 2016}} termed a ''secretary and bookcase''. There is no unanimity on this term, even among specialists. In Europe the same piece of furniture has been called ''bureau and bookcase'' and then desk and bookcase.  Also, the general public usually calls this kind of desk a ''secretary'', or ''secrétaire''. In a taxonomic sense one could sometimes say that all desks which have the capacity to close off the working surface are secretaries, while all others are simply desks, but such a division would be too broad to be useful.{{According to whom|date=December 2016}} To add to the confusion, certain forms of the secretary desk are called ''escritoire'', usually when the bookcase section is covered with glazed panels instead of wooden doors, but the term ''escritoire'' is also sometimes used to define a very portable [[writing slope]], which is it at the other extreme in terms of bulk and weight.

[[Image:Chippendale Desk.jpg|thumb|right|Chippendale desk]]
When a secretary desk is cut in half vertically, so to speak, to provide a secretary desk half as wide as usual on one side and a glassed door cabinet on the other, this big piece of furniture is called a ''side-by-side secretary''. The term is also applied sometimes to very big pieces of furniture made up of three elements, one of them being a half-wide secretary desk.  Until recently there was a good example of a side-by-side secretary in the second floor office of the historic home of [[John Muir]] in [[Martinez, California]].  The attic of this home also had a good example of a [[portable desk]].

On most antique secretaries and also on most reproductions the user has to pull out two small wooden planks called sliders (sometimes "lopers") in order to support the desktop, before actually turning the desktop from its closed, angled, position to its normal horizontal working position. However, in quite a few of the antique versions a system of internal gears or levers connected both to the sliders and the hinged desktop automatically pushed the sliders out at the same time as the user pulled on the closed desktop to put it in its horizontal position. When the user closed it afterwards, the sliders would then retract automatically.  In such a case, the secretary is also known as a [[mechanical desk]] like many other desk forms which have some sort of mechanism pushing out elements of the desk and then pulling them back in automatically.

A secretary desk is, despite its name, generally not used by a person with the title of [[secretary]], since this kind of desk is an antique form which is now extremely rare in the modern [[office]], where a secretary (frequently called an administrative assistant) normally works.

[[File:Deepwater drilling systems 2.png|thumb|300px|Comparison of deepwater semi-submersible and [[drillship]]]]

A '''semi-submersible platform''' is a specialised [[marine vessel]] used in a number of specific offshore roles including as [[offshore drilling|offshore drilling rigs]], safety vessels, oil production platforms, and heavy lift cranes.  They are designed with good stability and [[seakeeping]] characteristics. Other terms for these platforms include ''semi-submersible'', ''semi-sub'', 
or simply ''semi''.{{citation needed (lead)|date=November 2018}}

While drillships are another type of drilling rig that can drill in ultra-deepwater—drillships are capable of holding more equipment—semisubmersibles are sometime chosen for their comparative stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?insight_id=338&amp;c_id=24|title=How Do Semisubmersibles Work?|website=www.rigzone.com|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Offshore drilling in water depth greater than around 520 meters requires that operations be carried out from a floating vessel, since fixed structures are not practical. Initially in the early 1950s monohull ships such as [[CUSS I]] were used, but these were found to have significant heave, pitch and yaw motions in large waves, and the industry needed more stable drilling platforms.

A semi-submersible obtains most of its buoyancy from ballasted, watertight [[Floats (nautical)|pontoons]] located below the ocean surface and wave action. Structural columns connect the pontoons and operating deck.&lt;ref name="oceanstaroec2000"&gt;[http://www.oceanstaroec.com/fame/2000/semisubmersible.htm 2000Technology Pioneers]. Oceanstaroec.com. Retrieved on 2010-12-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The operating deck can be located high above the sea level owing to the good [[Ship stability|stability]] of the design, and therefore is kept well away from the waves.

With its hull structure submerged at a deep draft, the semi-submersible is less affected by wave loadings than a normal ship. With a small water-plane area, however, the semi-submersible is sensitive to load changes, and therefore must be carefully [[:wikt:trim|trimmed]] to maintain stability. Unlike a [[Submersible drilling rig|submersible]], a semi-submersible vessel is not supported by resting on the [[seabed]].

Semi-submersible vessels are able to transform from a deep to a shallow [[draft (hull)|draft]] by deballasting (removing ballast water from the hull), thereby becoming surface vessels. Usually they are moved from location to location in this configuration. The [[Heavy-lift_ship|heavy lift vessels]] use this capability to submerge the majority of their structure, locate beneath another floating vessel, and then deballast to pick up the other vessel as a cargo.

==Early history==
[[File:Blue Water Rig No. 1.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Blue Water Rig No. 1]]]]
The semi-submersible design was first developed{{when|date=November 2018}} for [[oil platform|offshore drilling]] activities. Bruce Collipp of [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] is regarded as the inventor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceanstaroec.com/fame/1998/collipp.htm 1998 Industry Pioneers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204170426/http://www.oceanstaroec.com/fame/1998/collipp.htm |date=4 February 2012 }}. Oceanstaroec.com. Retrieved on 2010-12-30.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, [[Edward Robert Armstrong]] may have paved the way with his idea of "seadrome" landing strips for airplanes in the late 1920s, since his idea involved the same use of columns on ballast tanks below the surface and anchored to the ocean floor by steel cables.&lt;ref&gt;America-Europe via North Atlantic airways over the Armstrong seadrome system of commercial ocean transit by airplane, Edward Robert Armstrong (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;

When oil drilling moved into offshore waters,{{when|date=November 2018}}&lt;!-- would really help the global reader grok the concept if we could add, factually, something like "... after the 19y0s".  Do we know when this occurred in petroleum exploration? --&gt; fixed platform rigs and [[submersible drilling rig|submersible rigs]] were built, but were limited to shallow waters. The first [[jackup rig]]s were built{{when|date=November 2018}} when drilling equipment was needed in water depths greater than {{convert|100|ft|m|0}} in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

The first semisubmersible arrived by accident in 1961. Blue Water Drilling Company owned and operated the four column [[submersible drilling rig]] ''Blue Water Rig No.1'' in the Gulf of Mexico for [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Oil Company]]. As the [[Pontoon (boat)|pontoons]] were not sufficiently [[buoyant]] to support the weight of the rig and its consumables, it was towed between locations at a draught midway between the top of the pontoons and the underside of the deck. It was observed that the motions at this draught were very small, and Blue Water Drilling and Shell jointly decided that the rig could be operated in the floating mode.&lt;ref name="oceanstaroec2000"/&gt;

The first purpose built drilling semi-submersible ''Ocean Driller'' was launched in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;60 Years in the Gulf of Mexico, E&amp;P Magazine, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, many semi-submersibles have been purpose-designed for the drilling industry mobile offshore fleet.

The industry quickly accepted the semi-submersible concept and the fleet increased rapidly to 30 units by 1972.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Classification==
Drilling rig construction has historically occurred in boom periods and therefore "batches" of drilling rigs have been built. Offshore drilling rigs have been loosely classified in nominal "generations" depending upon the year built and water depth capability as follows:{{cn|date=July 2014}}{{or|date=July 2014}}

==Applications==

===Mobile offshore drilling units (MODU)===
[[File:20061204 MightyServant3 JUSTbefore.JPG|thumb|300px|Semi-submersible drilling rig on [[Mighty Servant 3|MS3 semi-submersible heavy-lift ship]]]]
[[File:Eni saipem scarabeo 7.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Saipem Scarabeo 7 semi-submersible drilling rig docked in [[Cape Town]]]]
Semi-submersible rigs make stable platforms for drilling for offshore oil and gas. They can be towed into position by a [[tugboat]] and anchored, or moved by and kept in position by their own [[azimuth thruster]]s with [[dynamic positioning]].

The [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]] MODU Code is an accredited design and operational guideline for mobile offshore drilling units of the semi-submersible type.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imo.org/publications/mainframe.asp?topic_id=740&amp;doc_id=2512 ]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semi-submersible crane vessels (SSCV)===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ship prefix]] --&gt;
[[File:SSCVThialf.jpg|thumb|300px|Thialf in Norwegian fjord with [[Fulmar Oil Field|Fulmar]] single anchor leg mooring (SALM) buoy.]]
[[File:Iolair.jpg|thumb|300px|Iolair on [[Elbe river]], 1990]]
[[File:Oil platform P-51 (Brazil).jpg|thumb|300px|The Brazilian [[Petrobras]] P-51 semi-submersible oil platform]]

The advantages of the semi-submersible vessel stability were soon recognized for [[offshore construction]] when in 1978 [[Heerema Marine Contractors]] constructed the two sister [[crane vessel]]s called [[DCV Balder|''Balder'']] and [[Hermod (ship)|''Hermod'']]. These semi-submersible crane vessels (SSCV) consist of two lower hulls (pontoons), three columns on each pontoon and an upper hull. Shortly after [[J. Ray McDermott]] and [[Saipem]] also introduced SSCVs, resulting in two new enormous vessels ''DB-102'' (now [[SSCV Thialf|''Thialf'']]) and ''[[Saipem 7000]]'', capable of lifting respectively 14,200 and 14,000 tons.

During transit an SSCV is de-ballasted to a draught where only part of the lower hull is submerged. During lifting operations, the vessel is ballasted down. This way, the lower hull is well submerged. This reduces the effect of waves and swell. High [[Instantaneous stability|stability]] is obtained by placing the columns far apart. The high stability allows them to lift extremely high loads safely.

===Offshore support vessels (OSV)===
Semi-submersibles are particularly suited to a number of offshore support vessel roles because of their good stability, large deck areas, and variable deck load (VDL). Some of the most prominent vessels are;
*''Uncle John'' – Diving and construction support vessel, built for Houlder Offshore in 1977&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/othpdf/200-399/oth363.pdf Summary report on an investigation into the correlation between full-scale measured and predicted motions of the SSSV 'Uncle John']&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Seaway Swan]]'' – [[Diving support vessel]] built in 1977
*''[[Transocean Marianas|Tharos]]'' – Offshore safety support vessel, built in 1979 and since converted into a drilling vessel, and rechristened ''[[Transocean Marianas]]''
*''[[Stadive]]'' – DSV built for [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] in 1982&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shell.co.uk/home/content/gbr/aboutshell/shell_businesses/e_and_p/introduction/thehistory_01041405.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706173007/http://www.shell.co.uk/home/content/gbr/aboutshell/shell_businesses/e_and_p/introduction/thehistory_01041405.html |date=6 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Iolair]]'' – Offshore safety support vessel, built for [[BP]] in 1982, Sedco/Phillips SS was the first built to Red Adair's recommendations. ''Iolair'' followed.
*''[[Safe Karinia]]'' – Offshore operations vessel, built in 1982
*''[[Polyconfidence]]'' – Offshore accommodation platform, built in 1988. Since converted to a dynamically positioned drilling vessel by Diamond Offshore. Renamed Ocean Confidence.
*''[[Q4000 (vessel)|Q4000]]'' – Offshore multiservice vessel, built for [[Caldive]] in 2002&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helixesg.com/Portals/0/PDFs/q4000.pdf] {{Dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Ocean Odyssey]]'' – Converted semi-submersible drilling rig used as a rocket launch pad

===Offshore production platforms===
When oil fields were first developed in offshore locations, drilling semi-submersibles were converted for use as combined drilling and production platforms. These vessels offered very stable and cost effective platforms. The first semi-submersible floating production platform was the ''Argyll FPF'' converted from the ''Transworld 58'' drilling semi-submersible in 1975 for the Hamilton Brothers North Sea Argyll oil field.

As the oil industry progressed into deeper water and harsh environments, purpose-built production semi-submersible platforms were designed. The first purpose-built semi-submersible production platform was for the [[Balmoral field]], UK North Sea in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gvac.se/gva-500/ *GVAC – GVA 5000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226225843/http://www.gvac.se/gva-500/ |date=26 February 2012 }}. Gvac.se. Retrieved on 2010-12-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''smart doorbell''' is an internet-connected [[doorbell]] that notifies the [[smartphone]] of the home owner when a guest arrives to the entrance of the door. It activates when the guest presses the button of the doorbell, or alternatively, when the doorbell senses a guest with its built-in [[motion sensor]]s. The smart door bell allows the home owner using the smartphone app to watch and talk with the guest by using the doorbell's built-in high-definition infrared camera and microphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canitec.org/best-peephole-camera-reviews-and-buying-guide/ |title=Best Peephole Cameras and Buying Guide |website=canitec.org |date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some smart doorbells also allow the user to open to door to the guest remotely using a [[smart lock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-a-smart-doorbell-and-which-should-you-buy/ |title=What Is A Smart Doorbell, And Which Should You Buy? |website=Makeuseof.com |date=2015-06-10 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
One of the earliest smart doorbells that entered to the market is the [[Ring Video Doorbell]] which was created by entrepreneur [[James Siminoff]] in 2012. Since then, several smart doorbells have been introduced to the market, some of them with additional, unique features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safewise.com/resources/smart-doorbell-buyers-guide |title=8 Best Smart Doorbells for Your Home |website=SafeWise.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shu |first=Les |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/smartbell-doorbell/ |title=Smartbell is a smartphone-based doorbell solution for your home |publisher=Digital Trends |date=2013-11-18 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/10/ding-smart-doorbell-not-smart-good/ |title=Ding Is a Smart Doorbell—But Not Too Smart for Its Own Good |website=Wired.com |date=2016-10-12 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security issues==
Alarming concerns regarding the security of the smart doorbells have been raised. Researchers at Pen Test Partners in the UK have analyzed the Ring smart doorbell and concluded that it's possible for an attacker to gain access to the homeowner’s wireless network by unscrewing the Ring, pressing the setup button and accessing the configuration URL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://betanews.com/2016/01/14/your-smart-doorbell-may-let-in-unwanted-visitors/ |title=Your smart doorbell may let in unwanted visitors |website=Betanews.com |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another security issue that have been observed, a mix-up of two databases allowed some users of the Ring smart doorbell to view live footage from complete strangers' front porches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.grahamcluley.com/ring-smart-doorbell-privacy/ |title="Smart" doorbell bug exposes video footage from strangers' homes |website=Grahamcluley.com |date=2016-05-17 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Software development process}}
'''Software development''' is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, [[computer programmer|programming]], [[software documentation|documenting]], [[software testing|testing]], and [[Software bugs|bug fixing]] involved in creating and maintaining [[application software|applications]], [[software framework|frameworks]], or other software components. Software development is a process of writing and [[Software maintenance|maintaining]] the [[source code]], but in a broader sense, it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, sometimes in a planned and [[Software development process|structured]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestpricecomputers.co.uk/glossary/application-development.htm |title=Application Development (AppDev) Defined and Explained |publisher=Bestpricecomputers.co.uk |date=2007-08-13 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, software development may include research, new development, prototyping, modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=DRM Associates|title=New Product Development Glossary |url=http://www.npd-solutions.com/glossary.html |year=2002|accessdate=2006-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software can be developed for a variety of purposes, the three most common being to meet specific needs of a specific client/business (the case with [[custom software]]), to meet a perceived need of some set of potential [[user (computing)|users]] (the case with [[Commercial software|commercial]] and [[open source software]]), or for personal use (e.g. a scientist may write software to automate a mundane task). '''Embedded software development''', that is, the development of [[embedded software]], such as used for controlling consumer products, requires the development process to be [[System integration|integrated]] with the development of the controlled physical product.  [[System software]] underlies applications and the programming process itself, and is often developed separately.

The need for better [[quality control]] of the software development process has given rise to the discipline of [[software engineering]], which aims to apply the systematic approach exemplified in the [[engineering]] paradigm to the process of software development.

There are many approaches to software project management, known as software development life cycle models, methodologies, processes, or models. The [[waterfall model]] is a traditional version, contrasted with the more recent innovation of [[agile software development]].

==Methodologies==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}

A [[software development process]] (also known as a software development methodology, model, or life cycle) is a framework that is used to [[structure]], [[plan]], and control the process of developing [[information system]]s. A wide variety of such frameworks has evolved over the years, each with its own recognized strengths and weaknesses. There are several different approaches to software development: some take a more structured, engineering-based approach to developing business solutions, whereas others may take a more incremental approach, where software evolves as it is developed piece-by-piece. One system development methodology is not necessarily suitable for use by all projects. Each of the available methodologies is best suited to specific kinds of projects, based on various technical, organizational, project and team considerations.

Most methodologies share some combination of the following stages of software development:
* Analyzing the problem
* Market research
* Gathering requirements for the proposed business solution
* Devising a plan or design for the software-based solution
* Implementation (coding) of the software
* Testing the software
* Deployment
* [[Software maintenance|Maintenance]] and [[Software bugs|bug fixing]]

These stages are often referred to collectively as the software development life-cycle, or SDLC. Different approaches to software development may carry out these stages in different orders, or devote more or less time to different stages. The level of detail of the documentation produced at each stage of software development may also vary. These stages may also be carried out in turn (a “waterfall” based approach), or they may be repeated over various cycles or iterations (a more "extreme" approach). The more extreme approach usually involves less time spent on planning and documentation, and more time spent on coding and development of automated tests. More “extreme” approaches also promote continuous testing throughout the development life-cycle, as well as having a working (or bug-free) product at all times. More structured or “[[Waterfall model|waterfall]]” based approaches attempt to assess the majority of risks and develop a detailed plan for the software before  [[implementation]] (coding) begins, and avoid significant design changes and re-coding in later stages of the software development life-cycle planning.

There are significant advantages and disadvantages to the various methodologies, and the best approach to solving a problem using software will often depend on the type of problem. If the problem is well understood and a solution can be effectively planned out ahead of time, the more "waterfall" based approach may work the best. If, on the other hand, the problem is unique (at least to the development team) and the structure of the software solution cannot be easily envisioned, then a more "extreme" incremental approach may work best.

==Software development activities==

===Identification of need===
The sources of ideas for software products are plentiful. These ideas can come from [[market research]] including the [[demographics]] of potential new customers, existing customers, sales prospects who rejected the product, other internal software development staff, or a creative third party. Ideas for software products are usually first evaluated by [[marketing]] personnel for economic feasibility, for fit with existing channels distribution, for possible effects on existing product lines, required [[Software feature|features]], and for fit with the company's marketing objectives. In a marketing evaluation phase, the cost and time assumptions become evaluated. A decision is reached early in the first phase as to whether, based on the more detailed information generated by the marketing and development staff, the project should be pursued further.&lt;ref name="Mor01"&gt;Joseph M. Morris (2001). ''Software Industry Accounting''. p.1.10&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''"Great Software Debates"'', [[Alan M. Davis]] states in the chapter ''"Requirements"'', sub-chapter ''"The Missing Piece of Software Development"''
&lt;blockquote&gt;Students of engineering learn engineering and are rarely exposed to finance or marketing. Students of marketing learn marketing and are rarely exposed to finance or engineering. Most of us become specialists in just one area. To complicate matters, few of us meet interdisciplinary people in the workforce, so there are few roles to mimic. Yet, software product planning is critical to the development success and absolutely requires knowledge of multiple disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Alan M. Davis. Great Software Debates (October 8, 2004), pp:125-128 Wiley-IEEE Computer Society Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because software development may involve compromising or going beyond what is required by the client, a software development project may stray into less technical concerns such as [[human resources]], [[risk management]], [[intellectual property]], [[budgeting]], [[crisis management]], etc. These processes may also cause the role of [[business development]] to overlap with software development.

===Planning===
Planning is an objective of each and every activity, where we want to discover things that belong to the project.
An important task in creating a software program is extracting the [[requirement]]s or [[requirements analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, P., and Wand, Y. [http://www.kathrynpieplow.pwrfaculty.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Ralph-Wand-definition-design.pdf A Proposal for a Formal Definition of the Design Concept]. In, Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., [[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos, J.]], and Robinson, W., (eds.), Design Requirements Engineering: A Ten-Year Perspective: Springer-Verlag, 2009, pp. 103-136&lt;/ref&gt; Customers typically have an abstract idea of what they want as an end result but do not know what ''software'' should do. Skilled and experienced software engineers recognize incomplete, ambiguous, or even contradictory requirements at this point.  Frequently demonstrating live code may help reduce the risk that the requirements are incorrect.

"Although much effort is put in the requirements phase to ensure that requirements are complete and consistent, rarely that is the case; leaving the software design phase as the most influential one when it comes to minimizing the effects of new or changing requirements. Requirements volatility is challenging because they impact future or already going development efforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Otero|first1=Carlos|title=Software Design Challenges|url=http://www.ittoday.info/ITPerformanceImprovement/Articles/2012-06Otero.html|website=IT Performance Improvement|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis LLC|accessdate=19 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the general requirements are gathered from the client, an analysis of the scope of the development should be determined and clearly stated.  This is often called a scope document.

===Designing===
{{Main|Software design|Systems design}}
Once the requirements are established, the design of the software can be established in a [[software design document]].  This involves a preliminary or [[high-level design]] of the main modules with an overall picture (such as a [[block diagram]]) of how the parts fit together.  The language, operating system, and hardware components should all be known at this time.  Then a detailed or low-level design is created, perhaps with [[software prototyping|prototyping]] as proof-of-concept or to firm up requirements.

===Implementation, testing and documenting===
[[Implementation]] is the part of the process where [[software engineering|software engineers]] actually [[computer programming|program]] the code for the project.

[[Software testing]] is an integral and important phase of the software development process. This part of the process ensures that [[software bug|defects]] are recognized as soon as possible. In some processes, generally known as [[test-driven development]], tests may be developed just before implementation and serve as a guide for the implementation's correctness.

[[Software documentation|Documenting]] the internal design of software for the purpose of future maintenance and enhancement is done throughout development. This may also include the writing of an [[API]], be it external or internal. The software engineering process chosen by the developing team will determine how much internal documentation (if any) is necessary. Plan-driven models (e.g., [[Waterfall model|Waterfall]]) generally produce more documentation than [[Agile software development|Agile]] models.

===Deployment and maintenance===
[[Software deployment|Deployment]] starts directly after the code is appropriately tested, approved for [[software release|release]], and sold or otherwise distributed into a production environment. This may involve installation, customization (such as by setting parameters to the customer's values), testing, and possibly an extended period of evaluation. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Software training and [[Technical support|support]] is important, as software is only effective if it is used correctly.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[Software maintenance|Maintaining]] and enhancing software to cope with newly discovered [[software bug|faults]] or requirements can take substantial time and effort, as missed requirements may force redesign of the software. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Subtopics==

===View model===
[[File:TEAF Matrix of Views and Perspectives.svg|thumb|456px|The [[TEAF]] Matrix of Views and Perspectives.]]
A [[view model]] is a framework that provides the [[View model|viewpoints]] on the [[system]] and its [[environment (systems)|environment]], to be used in the [[software development process]]. It is a graphical representation of the underlying semantics of a view.

The purpose of viewpoints and views is to enable human engineers to comprehend very [[complex system]]s and to organize the elements of the problem and the solution around domains of [[expertise]]. In the [[engineering]] of physically intensive systems, viewpoints often correspond to capabilities and responsibilities within the engineering organization.&lt;ref name="NIST2003"&gt;Edward J. Barkmeyer ea (2003). [http://www.mel.nist.gov/msidlibrary/doc/AMIS-Concepts.pdf ''Concepts for Automating Systems Integration''] NIST 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most complex system specifications are so extensive that no one individual can fully comprehend all aspects of the specifications. Furthermore, we all have different interests in a given system and different reasons for examining the [[system]]'s [[specification]]s. A [[business]] executive will ask different questions of a system make-up than would a system implementer. The concept of viewpoints framework, therefore, is to provide separate viewpoints into the specification of a given complex system. These viewpoints each satisfy an audience with interest in some set of aspects of the system. Associated with each viewpoint is a viewpoint language
that optimizes the vocabulary and presentation for the audience of that viewpoint.

===Business process and data modelling===
[[Information visualisation|Graphical representation]] of the current state of information provides a very effective means for presenting information to both users and system [[software developer|developers]].
[[File:Process and data modeling.svg|thumb|360px|example of the interaction between business process and data models.&lt;ref name=SS93 /&gt;]]
* A [[business model]] illustrates the functions associated with the business process being modeled and the organizations that perform these functions. By depicting activities and information flows, a foundation is created to visualize, define, understand, and validate the nature of a process.
* A [[data model]] provides the details of information to be stored and is of primary use when the final product is the generation of computer [[software code]] for an application or the preparation of a functional specification to aid a computer software [[make-buy decision|make-or-buy decision]]. See the figure on the right for an example of the interaction between business process and data models.&lt;ref name="SS93"&gt;Paul R. Smith &amp; Richard Sarfaty (1993). [http://www.osti.gov/energycitations/servlets/purl/10160331-YhIRrY/ Creating a strategic plan for configuration management using Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools.] Paper For 1993 National DOE/Contractors and Facilities CAD/CAE User's Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, a model is created after conducting an interview, referred to as [[business analysis]]. The interview consists of a facilitator asking a series of questions designed to extract required information that describes a process. The interviewer is called a facilitator to emphasize that it is the participants who provide the information. The facilitator should have some knowledge of the process of interest, but this is not as important as having a structured methodology by which the questions are asked of the process expert. The methodology is
important because usually a team of facilitators is collecting information across the facility and the results of the information from all the interviewers must fit together once completed.&lt;ref name=SS93 /&gt;

The models are developed as defining either the current state of the process, in which case the final product is called the "as-is" snapshot model, or a collection of ideas of what the process should contain, resulting in a "what-can-be" model. Generation of process and data models can be used to determine if the existing processes and information systems are sound and only need minor modifications or enhancements, or if re-engineering is required as a corrective action. The creation of business models is more than a way to view or automate your information process. Analysis can be used to fundamentally reshape the way your business or organization conducts its operations.&lt;ref name=SS93 /&gt;

===Computer-aided software engineering===
[[Computer-aided software engineering]] (CASE), in the field [[software engineering]], is the scientific application of a set of software tools and methods to the development of [[software]] which results in high-quality, defect-free, and maintainable software products.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, D.L (1989). "Selecting and effectively using a computer-aided software engineering tool". Annual Westinghouse computer symposium; 6-7 Nov 1989; Pittsburgh, PA (USA); DOE Project.&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to methods for the development of [[information system]]s together with automated tools that can be used in the software development process.&lt;ref&gt;P. Loucopoulos and V. Karakostas (1995). ''System Requirements Engineering''. McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "computer-aided software engineering" (CASE) can refer to the [[software]] used for the automated development of [[systems software]], i.e., computer code. The CASE functions include analysis, design, and programming. CASE tools automate methods for designing, documenting, and producing structured computer code in the desired [[programming language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/projects/devglossary/_case.html CASE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218104409/http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/projects/devglossary/_case.html |date=2012-02-18 }} definition In: ''[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/projects/devglossary/ Telecom Glossary 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122063850/http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/projects/devglossary/ |date=2005-11-22 }}. Retrieved 26 Oct 2008.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Two key ideas of Computer-aided Software System Engineering (CASE) are:&lt;ref&gt;K. Robinson (1992). ''Putting the Software Engineering into CASE''. New York : John Wiley and Sons Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Foster computer assistance in software development and [[software maintenance]] processes, and
* An engineering approach to software development and maintenance.

Typical CASE tools exist for [[configuration management]], [[data modeling]], [[model transformation]], [[refactoring]], [[source code generation]].

===Integrated development environment===
[[File:Anjuta-2.0.0-2.png|thumb|360px|[[Anjuta]], a C and C++ IDE for the GNOME environment]]
An [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) also known as ''integrated design environment'' or ''integrated debugging environment'' is a [[software application]] that provides comprehensive facilities to [[computer programmer]]s for software development. An IDE normally consists of a:
*[[Source code editor]],
*[[Compiler]] or [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]],
*[[Build automation]] tools, and
*[[Debugger]] (usually).
IDEs are designed to maximize programmer productivity by providing tight-knit components with similar [[user interface]]s. Typically an IDE is dedicated to a specific [[programming language]], so as to provide a feature set which most closely matches the [[programming paradigm]]s of the language.

===Modeling language===
A [[modeling language]] is any [[artificial language]] that can be used to express [[information]] or [[knowledge]] or [[system]]s in a [[structure]] that is defined by a consistent set of rules. The rules are used for interpretation of the meaning of components in the structure. A modeling language can be graphical or textual.&lt;ref&gt;Xiao He (2007). "[ftp://antvision.cn/pub/%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6/%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87/%E4%BD%95%E5%95%B8%E8%80%81%E5%B8%88%E8%AE%BA%E6%96%87/A%20metamodel%20for%20the%20notation%20of%20graphical%20modeling%20languages.pdf A metamodel for the notation of graphical modeling languages]". In: ''Computer Software and Applications Conference, 2007. COMPSAC 2007 – Vol. 1. 31st Annual International'', Volume 1, Issue, 24–27 July 2007, pp 219-224.&lt;/ref&gt; Graphical modeling languages use a [[diagramming technique|diagram techniques]] with named symbols that represent concepts and lines that connect the symbols and that represent relationships and various other graphical annotation to represent constraints. Textual modeling languages typically use standardised keywords accompanied by parameters to make computer-interpretable expressions.

Examples of graphical modelling languages in the field of software engineering are:
*[[Business Process Modeling Notation]] (BPMN, and the [[XML]] form BPML) is an example of a [[process modeling]] language.
*[[EXPRESS (data modeling language)|EXPRESS]] and EXPRESS-G (ISO 10303-11) is an international standard general-purpose [[data modeling]] language.
*[[Extended Enterprise Modeling Language]] (EEML) is commonly used for business process modeling across layers.
*[[Flowchart]] is a schematic representation of an algorithm or a stepwise process,
*[[Fundamental Modeling Concepts]] (FMC) modeling language for software-intensive systems.
*[[IDEF]] is a family of modeling languages, the most notable of which include [[IDEF0]] for functional modeling, [[IDEF1X]] for information [[Information model|modeling]], and [[IDEF5]] for modeling ontologies.
*[[LePUS3]] is an [[object-oriented]] visual Design Description Language and a [[formal specification]] language that is suitable primarily for modelling large object-oriented ([[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]) programs and [[design patterns]].
*[[Specification and Description Language]](SDL) is a specification language targeted at the unambiguous specification and description of the behaviour of reactive and distributed systems.
*[[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) is a [[general-purpose modeling]] language that is an industry standard for specifying software-intensive systems. UML 2.0, the current version, supports thirteen different diagram techniques and has widespread tool support.

Not all modeling languages are executable, and for those that are, using them doesn't necessarily mean that programmers are no longer needed. On the contrary, executable modeling languages are intended to amplify the productivity of skilled programmers, so that they can address more difficult problems, such as [[parallel computing]] and [[distributed system]]s.

===Programming paradigm===
A [[programming paradigm|programming paradi]][[programming paradigm|gm]] is a fundamental style of [[computer programming]], which is not generally dictated by the project management methodology (such as waterfall or agile). Paradigms differ in the concepts and abstractions used to represent the elements of a program (such as objects, functions, variables, constraints) and the steps that comprise a computation (such as assignations, evaluation, continuations, data flows).  Sometimes the concepts asserted by the paradigm are utilized cooperatively in high-level system architecture design; in other cases, the programming paradigm's scope is limited to the internal structure of a particular program or module.

A [[programming language]] can support [[multi-paradigm programming language|multiple paradigms]]. For example, programs written in [[C++]] or [[Object Pascal]] can be purely [[procedural programming|procedural]], or purely [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]], or contain elements of both paradigms. Software designers and programmers decide how to use those paradigm elements. In [[object-oriented programming]], programmers can think of a program as a collection of interacting objects, while in [[functional programming]] a program can be thought of as a sequence of stateless function evaluations. When programming computers or systems with many processors, [[process-oriented programming]] allows programmers to think about applications as sets of concurrent processes acting upon logically shared [[data structures]].

Just as different groups in [[software engineering]] advocate different ''methodologies'', different [[programming language]]s advocate different ''programming paradigms''. Some languages are designed to support one paradigm ([[Smalltalk]] supports object-oriented programming, [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] supports functional programming), while other programming languages support multiple paradigms (such as [[Object Pascal]], [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Visual Basic]], [[Common Lisp]], [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], and [[Oz (programming language)|Oz]]).

Many programming paradigms are as well known for what methods they ''forbid'' as for what they enable. For instance, pure functional programming forbids using [[side-effect (computer science)|side-effects]]; [[structured programming]] forbids using [[goto]] statements. Partly for this reason, new paradigms are often regarded as doctrinaire or overly rigid by those accustomed to earlier styles.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Avoiding certain methods can make it easier to prove theorems about a program's correctness, or simply to understand its behavior.

Examples of high-level paradigms include:
*[[Aspect-oriented software development]]
*[[Domain-specific modeling]]
*[[Model-driven engineering]]
*[[Object-oriented programming]] methodologies
**[[Grady Booch]]'s [[object-oriented design]] (OOD), also known as object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD). The Booch model includes six diagrams: class, object, state transition, interaction, module, and process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Georges G. |last1=Merx |first2=Ronald J. |last2=Norman |year=2006 |title=Unified Software Engineering with Java |page=201 |isbn=0130473766 |publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Search-based software engineering]]
*[[Service-oriented modeling]]
*[[Structured programming]]

'''Suspension array technology''' (or '''SAT''') is a high throughput, large-scale, and multiplexed screening platform used in [[molecular biology]]. SAT has been widely applied to [[genomic]] and [[proteomic]] research, such as [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) genotyping, [[genetic disease]] screening, [[gene expression]] profiling, screening drug discovery and clinical diagnosis.&lt;ref name="rev"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Dunbar|first1= Sherry A.|year= 2006|title= Applications of Luminex xMAP technology for rapid, high-throughput multiplexed nucleic acid detection|journal= Clinica Chimica Acta|volume= 363|issue= 1–2|pages= 71–82|doi= 10.1016/j.cccn.2005.06.023|pmid= 16102740}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Seideman|first1= Jonathan|last2= Peritt|first2= David|year= 2002|title= A novel monoclonal antibody screening method using Luminex-100 microsphere system|journal= Journal of Immunological Methods|volume= 267|issue= 2|pages= 165–171|doi=10.1016/s0022-1759(02)00168-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bac"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Dunbar|first1= Sherry A.|last2= Vander Zee|first2= Coe A.|last3= Oliver|first3= Kerry G.|last4= Karem|first4= Kevin L.|last5= Jacobson|first5= James W.|year= 2003|title= Quantitative, multiplexed detection of bacterial pathogens: DNA and protein applications of the Luminex LabMAP system|journal= Journal of Microbiological Methods|volume= 53|issue= 2|pages= 245–252|doi= 10.1016/S0167-7012(03)00028-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAT uses microsphere beads (5.6&amp;nbsp;um in diameter) to prepare arrays. SAT allows for the simultaneous testing of multiple gene variants through the use of these microsphere beads as each type of microsphere bead has a unique identification based on variations in optical properties, most common is fluorescent colour. As each colour and intensity of colour has a unique wavelength, beads can easily be differentiated based on their wavelength intensity. Microspheres are readily suspendable in solution and exhibit favorable kinetics during an assay. Similar to flat microarrays (e.g. [[DNA microarray]]), an appropriate receptor molecule, such as DNA [[oligonucleotide]] probes, [[antibodies]], or other [[proteins]], attach themselves to the differently labeled microspheres. This produces thousands of microsphere array elements. Probe-target hybridization is usually detected by optically labeled targets, which determines the relative abundance of each target in the sample.&lt;ref name="SAT"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Nolan|first1= John P.|last2= Sklar|first2= Larry A.|year= 2002|title= Suspension array technology: evolution of the flat-array paradigm|journal= Trends in Biotechnology|volume= 20|issue= 1|pages= 9–12|doi=10.1016/s0167-7799(01)01844-3|pmid= 11742671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of SAT using DNA hybridization==
[[File:Suspension array.jpg|thumb|right|650px|Overview of the suspension array technology procedures, using DNA hybridization as a model.]]
[[DNA]] is extracted from cells used to create test fragments. These test fragments are added to a solution containing a variety of microsphere beads. Each type of microsphere bead contains a known DNA probe with a unique [[fluorescent]] identity. Test fragments and probes on the microsphere beads are allowed to hybridize to each other. Once hybridized, the microsphere beads are sorted, usually using [[flow cytometry]]. This allows for the detection of each of the gene variants from the original sample. The resulting data collected will indicate the relative abundance of each hybridized sample to the microsphere.

==Multiplexing==
Since microsphere beads are easily suspended in solution and each microsphere retains its identity when hybridized to the test sample, a typical suspension array experiment can analyze a wide range of biological analysis in a single reaction, called "multiplexing". In general, each type of microsphere used in an array is individually prepared in bulk. For example, the commercially available microsphere arrays from Luminex xMAP&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; technology uses a 10X10 element array. This array involves beads with red and infrared dyes, each with ten different intensities, to give a 100-element array.&lt;ref name="SAT" /&gt; Thus, the array size would increase exponentially if multiple dyes are used. For example, five different dyes with 10 different intensities per dye will give rise to 100,000 different array elements.

==Procedure==

===Sample targeting===
When using different types of microspheres, SAT is capable of simultaneously testing multiple variables, such as [[DNA]] and [[proteins]], in a given sample. This allows SAT to analyze variety of molecular targets during a single reaction. The common [[nucleic acid]] detection method includes direct DNA hybridization. The direct DNA hybridization approach is the simplest suspension array assay whereby 15 to 20 bp DNA oligonucleotides attached to microspheres are amplified using [[PCR]]. This is the optimized probe length as it minimizes the melting temperature variation among different probes during probe-target hybridization.&lt;ref name="rev" /&gt; After amplifying one DNA oligoprobe of interest, it can be used to create 100 different probes on 100 different sets of microspheres, each with the capability of capturing 100 potential targets (if using a 100-plex array). Similarly, target DNA samples are usually [[PCR]] amplified and labeled.&lt;ref name="SAT" /&gt; Hybridization between the capture probe and the target [[DNA]] is achieved by melting and annealing [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] target [[DNA]] sequences to their capture probes located on the microspheres. After washing to remove non-specific binding between sequences, only strongly paired probe-targets will remain hybridized.&lt;ref name="rev" /&gt;

===Sorting and detection with flow cytometry===
''For more details on this topic, see [[flow cytometry]]''

Since the optical identity of each microsphere is known, the quantification of target samples hybridized to the microspheres can be achieved by comparing the relative intensity of target markers in one set of microspheres to target markers in another set of microspheres using [[flow cytometry]]. Microspheres can be sorted based using both their unique optical properties and level of hybridization to the target sequence.

==Strengths==
* '''Rapid/high throughput:''' In multiplex analysis, a 100-plex assay can be analyzed in every 30 seconds. The recent reported high-throughput [[flow cytometry]] can sample a 96-well plate in 1 minute, and theoretically, the 100-plex assay with this system can be analyzed in less than 1 second, or potentially deliver 12 million samples per day.&lt;ref name="SAT" /&gt;
* '''High array density/multiplex:''' Compared to flat microarrays, SAT allows one to perform parallel measurements. A few microliters of microspheres could contain thousands of array elements and each array element is represented by hundreds of individual microspheres. Thus, the measurement by [[flow cytometry]] represents a replicate analysis of each array element.&lt;ref name="SAT" /&gt;
* '''Effective gathering of information:''' One of the benefits of using SAT is that it allows you to take one sample from a patient or research organism and simultaneously test for multiple gene variants. Thus, from a single sample you can determine which virus from a series of viruses a patient has, or which base pair mutation is present in the organism with a unique phenotype.&lt;ref name="bac" /&gt;
* '''Cost-effective:''' Currently, commercially available suspension array kits costs $0.10-$0.25 per sequence tested.&lt;ref name="rev" /&gt;

==Weaknesses==
* '''Relatively low array size''': Although it has the potential to use an increased amount of dyes to generate millions of different array elements, the current generation of commercially available microsphere arrays (from Luminex xMAP&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; technology) only uses two sets of dyes and therefore can only detect ~100 targets per experiment.&lt;ref name="SAT" /&gt;
* Hybridization between different sets of probes and target sequences requires a '''specific annealing temperature''', which is affected by length and sequence of the oligonucleotide probe. Therefore, for every experiment, only one possible annealing temperature can be used. Thus, all probes used in given experiment must be designed to hybridize to the target at the same temperature. Although introducing base pair mismatch in some sets of the probes could minimize annealing temperature differences between each set of probes, the hybridization problem is still significant if more than 10-20 targets are tested in one reaction.&lt;ref name="rev" /&gt;

In [[electrical engineering]], a '''switch''' is an [[electrical component]] that can "make" or "break" an [[electrical circuit]], interrupting the [[Electric current|current]] or diverting it from one conductor to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The mechanism of a switch removes or restores the conducting path in a circuit when it is operated. It may be operated manually, for example, a light switch or a keyboard button, may be operated by a moving object such as a door, or may be operated by some sensing element for pressure, temperature or flow. A switch will have one or more sets of contacts, which may operate simultaneously, sequentially, or alternately. Switches in high-powered circuits must operate rapidly to prevent destructive arcing, and may include special features to assist in rapidly interrupting a heavy current. Multiple forms of actuators are used for operation by hand or to sense position, level, temperature or flow.  Special types are used, for example, for control of machinery, to reverse electric motors, or to sense liquid level. Many specialized forms exist. A common use is control of lighting, where multiple switches may be wired into one circuit to allow convenient control of light fixtures.

By analogy with the devices that select one or more possible paths for electric currents, devices that route information in a computer network are also called "switches" - these are usually more complicated than simple electromechanical toggles or pushbutton devices, and operate without direct human interaction.

==Description==
[[File:switches-electrical.agr.jpg|300px|thumb|Electrical switches. Top, left to right: circuit breaker, [[mercury switch]], wafer switch, [[DIP&amp;nbsp;switch]], surface mount switch, [[reed switch]]. Bottom, left to right: wall switch (U.S.&amp;nbsp;style), miniature toggle switch, in‑line switch, push-button switch, rocker switch, microswitch.]]The most familiar form of switch is a manually operated [[electromechanical]] device with one or more sets of [[electrical contacts]], which are connected to external circuits.  Each set of contacts can be in one of two states: either "closed" meaning the contacts are touching and electricity can flow between them, or "open", meaning the contacts are separated and the switch is nonconducting.  The mechanism actuating the transition between these two states (open or closed) are usually (there are other types of actions) either an "''alternate action''" (flip the switch for continuous "on" or "off") or "''momentary''" (push for "on" and release for "off") type.

A switch may be directly manipulated by a human as a control signal to a system, such as a computer keyboard button, or to control power flow in a circuit, such as a [[light switch]]. Automatically operated switches can be used to control the motions of machines, for example, to indicate that a garage door has reached its full open position or that a machine tool is in a position to accept another workpiece. Switches may be operated by process variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, current, voltage, and force, acting as [[sensor]]s in a process and used to automatically control a system. For example, a [[thermostat]] is a temperature-operated switch used to control a heating process. A switch that is operated by another electrical circuit is called a [[relay]]. Large switches may be remotely operated by a motor drive mechanism. Some switches are used to isolate electric power from a system, providing a visible point of isolation that can be padlocked if necessary to prevent accidental operation of a machine during maintenance, or to prevent electric shock.

An ideal switch would have no voltage drop when closed, and would have no limits on voltage or current rating. It would have zero [[rise time]] and [[fall time]] during state changes, and would change state without "bouncing" between on and off positions.

Practical switches fall short of this ideal; they have resistance, limits on the current and voltage they can handle, finite switching time, etc. The ideal switch is often used in circuit analysis as it greatly simplifies the system of equations to be solved, but this can lead to a less accurate solution. Theoretical treatment of the effects of non-ideal properties is required in the design of large networks of switches, as for example used in telephone exchanges.

==Contacts==
[[File:On-Off Switch.jpg|100px|thumb|A toggle switch in the "on" position.]]
In the simplest case, a switch has two conductive pieces, often [[metal]], called ''contacts'', connected to an external [[Electric circuit|circuit]], that touch to complete (make) the circuit, and separate to open (break) the circuit. The contact material is chosen for its resistance to [[corrosion]], because most metals form [[Electrical insulation|insulating]] [[oxide]]s that would prevent the switch from working. Contact materials are also chosen on the basis of [[electrical conductivity]], [[Hardness (materials science)|hardness]] (resistance to [[Wear#Abrasive wear|abrasive wear]]), [[Strength of materials|mechanical strength]], low cost and low [[toxicity]].

Sometimes the contacts are [[Electroplating|plated]] with [[noble metals]]. They may be [[design]]ed to wipe against each other to clean off any contamination. Nonmetallic [[electrical conductor|conductors]], such as conductive [[plastic]], are sometimes used. To prevent the formation of insulating oxides, a minimum [[wetting current]] may be specified for a given switch design.

{{anchor|contact_terminology}}

===Contact terminology===
[[File:Tpst.jpg|300px|thumb|Triple-pole single-throw (TPST or 3PST) [[knife switch]] used to short the windings of a 3‑phase wind turbine for [[Dynamic braking|braking]] purposes. Here the switch is shown in the open position.]]

In electronics, switches are classified according to the arrangement of their contacts. A pair of contacts is said to be "''closed''" when current can flow from one to the other. When the contacts are separated by an [[insulator (electric)|insulating air gap]], they are said to be "''open''", and no current can flow between them at normal voltages.  The terms "''make''" for closure of contacts and "''break''" for opening of contacts are also widely used.

The terms '''pole''' and '''throw''' are also used to describe switch contact variations. The number of "''poles''" is the number of electrically separate switches which are controlled by a single physical actuator. For example, a "''2-pole''" switch has two separate, parallel sets of contacts that open and close in unison via the same mechanism. The number of "''throws''" is the number of separate wiring path choices other than "open" that the switch can adopt for each pole. A single-throw switch has one pair of contacts that can either be closed or open. A double-throw switch has a contact that can be connected to either of two other contacts, a triple-throw has a contact which can be connected to one of three other contacts, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herley.com/index.cfm?act=app_notes&amp;notes=switches RF Switch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423212637/http://www.herley.com/index.cfm?act=app_notes&amp;notes=switches |date=2011-04-23 }} Explanation by [[Herley Industries|Herley&amp;nbsp;– General Microwave]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Break-before-make|Make-before-break}}
In a switch where the contacts remain in one state unless actuated, such as a [[push-button]] switch, the contacts can either be '''normally open''' (abbreviated "'''n.o.'''" or "'''no'''") until closed by operation of the switch, or '''normally closed''' ("'''n.c.'''" or "'''nc'''") and opened by the switch action. A switch with both types of contact is called a ''changeover switch'' or ''double-throw switch''. These may be "'''make-before-break'''" ("'''MBB'''" or shorting) which momentarily connects both circuits, or may be "'''break-before-make'''" ("'''BBM'''" or non-shorting) which interrupts one circuit before closing the other.

These terms have given rise to abbreviations for the types of switch which are used in the [[electronics]] industry such as "''single-pole, single-throw''" (SPST) (the simplest type, "on or off") or "''single-pole, double-throw''" (SPDT), connecting either of two terminals to the common terminal. In [[Mains electricity|electrical power]] wiring (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;house and building wiring by [[electrician]]s), names generally involve the suffix ''"-way"''; however, these terms differ between [[British English]] and [[American English]] (i.e., the terms ''two&amp;nbsp;way'' and ''three&amp;nbsp; way'' are used with different meanings).

Switches with larger numbers of poles or throws can be described by replacing the "S" or "D" with a number (e.g. 3PST, SP4T, etc.) or in some cases the letter "T" (for "triple") or "Q" (for "quadruple").

===Contact bounce===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Elektronika BK]] --&gt;
[[File:Bouncy Switch.png|200px|thumb|Snapshot of switch bounce on an [[oscilloscope]]. The switch bounces between on and off several times before settling.]]
Contact bounce (also called ''chatter'') is a common problem with mechanical switches and [[relay]]s. Switch and relay contacts are usually made of springy metals. When the contacts strike together, their momentum and elasticity act together to cause them to bounce apart one or more times before making steady contact. The result is a rapidly pulsed electric current instead of a clean transition from zero to full current. The effect is usually unimportant in power circuits, but causes problems in some [[analogue electronics|analogue]] and [[logic circuit]]s that respond fast enough to misinterpret the on‑off pulses as a data stream.&lt;ref name="Walker1998"&gt;Walker, PMB, ''[[Chambers Science and Technology Dictionary]]'', Edinburgh, 1988, {{ISBN|1-85296-150-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of contact bounce can be eliminated by use of [[mercury-wetted relay|mercury-wetted contacts]], but these are now infrequently used because of the hazard of mercury release. Alternatively, contact circuit voltages can be [[low-pass filter]]ed to reduce or eliminate multiple pulses from appearing. In digital systems, multiple samples of the contact state can be taken at a low rate and examined for a steady sequence, so that contacts can settle before the contact level is considered reliable and acted upon. Bounce in SPDT switch contacts signals can be filtered out using a [[Multivibrator#Bistable|SR flip-flop]] (latch)  or [[Schmitt trigger]]. All of these methods are referred to as 'debouncing'.

By analogy, the term "debounce" has arisen in the software development industry to describe rate-limiting or throttling the frequency of a method's execution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unscriptable.com/2009/03/20/debouncing-javascript-methods/ "Debouncing Javascript Methods"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401013409/http://unscriptable.com/2009/03/20/debouncing-javascript-methods/ |date=2013-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Contact bouncing is used in the [[Hammond organ]] and together with the multiple non-synchron closing contacts under a piano key known as the ''Hammond Click''. 

In the [[Hammond organ]], multiple wires are pressed together under the piano keys of the manuals. Their bouncing and non-synchronous closing of the switches is known as ''Hammond Click'' and compositions exists that use and emphasize this feature. Some [[electronic organ]]s have a switchable replica of this sound effect.&lt;ref&gt;Features of Technics E-33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arcs and quenching===
When the power being switched is sufficiently large, the electron flow across opening switch contacts is sufficient to [[ionize]] the air molecules across the tiny gap between the contacts as the switch is opened, forming a [[gas plasma]], also known as an [[electric arc]]. The plasma is of low resistance and is able to sustain power flow, even with the separation distance between the switch contacts steadily increasing. The plasma is also very hot and is capable of eroding the metal surfaces of the switch contacts. Electric current arcing causes significant [[Contact protection#Contact wear|degradation of the contacts]] and also significant [[electromagnetic interference]] (EMI), requiring the use of [[arc suppression]] methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lab Note #105 ''Contact Life&amp;nbsp;– Unsuppressed vs. Suppressed Arcing'' | author =  | publisher = Arc Suppression Technologies | date = April 2011 | url = http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/lab-app-notes/ | accessdate = February 5, 2012 | format = [[pdf]] | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203004750/http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/lab-app-notes/ | archivedate = December 3, 2013 | df =  }} (3.6 Mb)&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the voltage is sufficiently high, an arc can also form as the switch is closed and the contacts approach. If the voltage potential is sufficient to exceed the [[breakdown voltage]] of the air separating the contacts, an arc forms which is sustained until the switch closes completely and the switch surfaces make contact.

In either case, the standard method for minimizing arc formation and preventing contact damage is to use a fast-moving switch mechanism, typically using a spring-operated [[Tipping point (physics)|tipping-point mechanism]] to assure quick motion of switch contacts, regardless of the speed at which the switch control is operated by the user. Movement of the switch control lever applies tension to a spring until a tipping point is reached, and the contacts suddenly snap open or closed as the spring tension is released.

As the power being switched increases, other methods are used to minimize or prevent arc formation. A plasma is hot and will rise due to [[convection]] air currents. The arc can be quenched with a series of non-conductive blades spanning the distance between switch contacts, and as the arc rises, its length increases as it forms ridges rising into the spaces between the blades, until the arc is too long to stay sustained and is extinguished. A ''puffer'' may be used to blow a sudden high velocity burst of gas across the switch contacts, which rapidly extends the length of the arc to extinguish it quickly.

Extremely large switches in excess of 100,000‑watt capacity often have switch contacts surrounded by something other than air to more rapidly extinguish the arc. For example, the switch contacts may operate in a vacuum, immersed in [[mineral oil]], or in [[Sulfur hexafluoride#Dielectric medium|sulfur hexafluoride]].

In AC power service, the current periodically passes through zero; this effect makes it harder to sustain an arc on opening. Manufacturers may rate switches with lower voltage or current rating when used in DC&amp;nbsp;circuits.

===Power switching===
When a switch is designed to switch significant power, the transitional state of the switch as well as the ability to withstand continuous operating currents must be considered. When a switch is in the on state, its resistance is near zero and very little power is dropped in the contacts; when a switch is in the off state, its resistance is extremely high and even less power is dropped in the contacts. However, when the switch is flicked, the resistance must pass through a state where a quarter of the load's rated power{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} (or worse if the load is not purely resistive) is briefly dropped in the switch.

For this reason, power switches intended to interrupt a load current have spring mechanisms to make sure the transition between on and off is as short as possible regardless of the speed at which the user moves the rocker.

Power switches usually come in two types. A momentary on‑off switch (such as on a [[laser pointer]]) usually takes the form of a button and only closes the circuit when the button is depressed. A regular on‑off switch (such as on a [[flashlight]]) has a constant on-off feature. Dual-action switches incorporate both of these features.

===Inductive loads===
When a strongly [[inductance|inductive]] load such as an [[electric motor]] is switched off, the current cannot drop instantaneously to zero; a [[Electric arc|spark]] will jump across the opening contacts. Switches for [[inductance|inductive]] loads must be rated to handle these cases. The spark will cause [[electromagnetic interference]] if not suppressed; a [[snubber]] network of a [[resistor]] and [[capacitor]] in series will quell the spark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.illinoiscapacitor.com/pdf/Papers/RC_snubber.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215074956/http://www.illinoiscapacitor.com/pdf/papers/rc_snubber.pdf |archivedate=2017-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incandescent loads===
[[File:General-Electric-silent-T-rated-light-switch.jpg|65px|thumb|right|A "T-rated" wall switch (the T is for ''Tungsten'' filament)&lt;ref name="Electrical_Power_Systems_Technology_pg337"&gt;{{cite book |title=Electrical Power Systems Technology |last1=Fardo |first1=Stephen |last2=Patrick |first2=Dale |date=2009-01-01 |publisher=The Fairmont Press, Inc. |page=337 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bohwbWi3bUMC&amp;lpg=PA337&amp;dq=switch%20T-rated&amp;pg=PA337#v=onepage&amp;q=switch%20T-rated&amp;f=false |accessdate=2015-01-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171224053707/https://books.google.com/books?id=bohwbWi3bUMC&amp;lpg=PA337&amp;dq=switch%20T-rated&amp;pg=PA337#v=onepage&amp;q=switch%20T-rated&amp;f=false |archivedate=2017-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is suited for incandescent loads.]]When turned on, an [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent lamp]] draws a large [[inrush current]]  of about ten times the steady-state current; as the filament heats up, its resistance rises and the current decreases to a steady-state value. A switch designed for an incandescent lamp load can withstand this inrush current.&lt;ref name="Electrical_Power_Systems_Technology_pg337"/&gt;

===Wetting current===
''[[Wetting current]]'' is the minimum current needing to flow through a mechanical switch while it is operated to break through any film of [[oxidation]] that may have been deposited on the switch contacts.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory K. McMillan (ed) ''Process/Industrial Instruments and Controls Handbook (5th Edition)'' (McGraw Hill, 1999) {{ISBN|0-07-012582-1}} page 7.26&lt;/ref&gt; The film of oxidation occurs often in areas with high [[humidity]]. Providing a sufficient amount of wetting current is a crucial step in designing [[Control engineering|systems]] that use delicate switches with small [[contact pressure]] as sensor inputs. Failing to do this might result in switches remaining electrically "open" due to contact oxidation.

==Actuator==
The moving part that applies the operating force to the contacts is called the ''[[actuator]]'', and may be a '''toggle''' or ''dolly'', a '''rocker''', a '''push-button''' or any type of mechanical linkage ''(see photo).''

===Biased switches===
A switch normally maintains its set position once operated. A biased switch contains a mechanism that springs it into another position when released by an operator. The momentary [[push-button]] switch is a type of biased switch. The most common type is a "push-to-make" (or normally-open or NO) switch, which makes contact when the button is pressed and breaks when the button is released. Each key of a computer keyboard, for example, is a normally-open "push-to-make" switch. A "push-to-break" (or normally-closed or NC) switch, on the other hand, breaks contact when the button is pressed and makes contact when it is released. An example of a push-to-break switch is a button used to release a door held closed by an [[electromagnet]]. The interior lamp of a household [[refrigerator]] is controlled by a switch that is held open when the door is closed.

===Rotary switch===
{{main|Rotary switch}}
[[File:Rotaryswitch.gif|thumb|A three-deck stacked rotary switch. Any number of switching elements may be stacked in this manner, by using a longer shaft and additional spacing standoffs between each switching element.]]

A rotary switch operates with a twisting motion of the operating handle with at least two positions. One or more positions of the switch may be momentary (biased with a spring), requiring the operator to hold the switch in the position. Other positions may have a detent to hold the position when released. A rotary switch may have multiple levels or "decks" in order to allow it to control multiple circuits.

One form of  rotary switch consists of a spindle or "rotor" that has a contact arm or "spoke" which projects from its surface like a cam. It has an array of terminals, arranged in a circle around the rotor, each of which serves as a contact for the "spoke" through which any one of a number of different electrical circuits can be connected to the rotor. The switch is layered to allow the use of multiple poles, each layer is equivalent to one pole. Usually such a switch has a detent mechanism so it "clicks" from one active position to another rather than stalls in an intermediate position. Thus a rotary switch provides greater pole and throw capabilities than simpler switches do.

Other types use a cam mechanism to operate multiple independent sets of contacts.

Rotary switches were used as channel selectors on television receivers until the early 1970s, as range selectors on electrical metering equipment, as band selectors on multi-band radios and other similar purposes. In industry, rotary switches are used for control of measuring instruments, [[switchgear]], or in control circuits.  For example, a [[radio control]]led overhead crane may have a large multi-circuit rotary switch to transfer hard-wired control signals from the local manual controls in the cab to the outputs of the remote control receiver.

===Toggle switch===
[[File:togglesw2.jpg|thumb|Large toggle switch, depicted in circuit "open" position, electrical contacts to left; background is 1/4" square graph paper]]
[[File:Nova1200.agr.jpg|thumb|Bank of toggle switches on a [[Data General Nova]] [[minicomputer]] front panel.]]
[[File:Toggle switch logic.jpg|thumb|Toggle switches with the shared cover preventing certain forbidden combinations]]

A toggle switch is a class of electrical switches that are manually actuated by a mechanical [[lever]], handle, or rocking mechanism.

Toggle switches are available in many different styles and sizes, and are used in numerous applications. Many are designed to provide the simultaneous actuation of multiple sets of [[electrical contact]]s, or the control of large amounts of [[electric current]] or [[Mains electricity|mains]] voltages.

The word "toggle" is a reference to a kind of mechanism or joint consisting of two arms, which are almost in line with each other, connected with an elbow-like pivot. However, the phrase "toggle switch" is applied to a switch with a short handle and a positive snap-action, whether it actually contains a toggle mechanism or not. Similarly, a switch where a definitive click is heard, is called a "positive on-off switch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gladstone|first=Bernard|title=The New York Times complete manual of home repair|year=1978|publisher=Times Books|pages=399|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9VGAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=heard#search_anchor|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329030338/http://books.google.com/books?id=Q9VGAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=heard#search_anchor|archivedate=2014-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A very common use of this type of switch is to switch lights or other electrical equipment on or off. Multiple toggle switches may be mechanically interlocked to prevent forbidden combinations.

In some contexts, particularly [[computing]], a toggle switch, or the action of toggling, is understood in the different sense of a mechanical or software switch that alternates between two states each time it is activated, regardless of mechanical construction. For example, the [[caps lock]] key on a computer causes all letters to be generated in capitals after it is pressed once; pressing it again reverts to lower-case letters.

==Special types==
[[File:Float switch on.jpg|thumb|Opened [[float switch]] of a dirty water pump]]
Switches can be designed to respond to any type of mechanical stimulus: for example, vibration (the trembler switch), tilt, air pressure, fluid level (a [[float switch]]), the turning of a key ([[key switch]]), linear or rotary movement (a [[limit switch]] or [[microswitch]]), or presence of a magnetic field (the [[reed switch]]). Many switches are operated automatically by changes in some environmental condition or by motion of machinery. A [[limit switch]] is used, for example, in machine tools to interlock operation with the proper position of tools. In heating or cooling systems a [[sail switch]] ensures that air flow is adequate in a duct. [[Pressure switch]]es respond to fluid pressure.

===Mercury tilt switch===
{{main|Mercury switch}}
The mercury switch consists of a drop of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] inside a [[glass]] bulb with two or more contacts. The two contacts pass through the glass, and are connected by the mercury when the bulb is tilted to make the mercury roll on to them.

This type of switch performs much better than the ball tilt switch, as the [[liquid metal]] connection is unaffected by dirt, debris and oxidation, it wets the contacts ensuring a very low resistance bounce-free connection, and movement and vibration do not produce a poor contact. These types can be used for precision works.

It can also be used where arcing is dangerous (such as in the presence of explosive vapour) as the entire unit is sealed.

===Knife switch===
{{main|Knife switch}}
[[File:Sectionneur.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A high-voltage disconnect switch used in an electrical substation. Such switches are used mostly to isolate circuits, and usually cannot break load current. High-voltage switches are available for the highest transmission voltages, up to 1&amp;nbsp;million volts. This switch is gang-operated so that all three phases are interrupted at the same time.]]

Knife switches consist of a flat metal blade, hinged at one end, with an insulating handle for operation, and a fixed contact. When the switch is closed, current flows through the hinged pivot and blade and through the fixed contact. Such switches are usually not enclosed. The knife and contacts are typically formed of [[copper]], [[steel]], or [[brass]], depending on the application. Fixed contacts may be backed up with a spring. Several parallel blades can be operated at the same time by one handle. The parts may be mounted on an insulating base with terminals for wiring, or may be directly bolted to an insulated switch board in a large assembly. Since the electrical contacts are exposed, the switch is used only where people cannot accidentally come in contact with the switch or where the voltage is so low as to not present a hazard.

Knife switches are made in many sizes from miniature switches to large devices used to carry thousands of amperes. In electrical transmission and distribution, gang-operated switches are used in circuits up to the highest voltages.

The disadvantages of the knife switch are the slow opening speed and the proximity of the operator to exposed live parts. Metal-enclosed safety [[disconnect switch]]es are used for isolation of circuits in industrial power distribution. Sometimes spring-loaded auxiliary blades are fitted which momentarily carry the full current during opening, then quickly part to rapidly extinguish the arc.

===Footswitch===
A footswitch is a rugged switch which is operated by foot pressure. An example of use is in the control of a machine tool, allowing the operator to have both hands free to manipulate the workpiece. The foot control of an [[electric guitar]] is also a footswitch.

===Reversing switch===
A DPDT switch has six connections, but since polarity reversal is a very common usage of DPDT switches, some variations of the DPDT switch are internally wired specifically for polarity reversal. These crossover switches only have four terminals rather than six. Two of the terminals are inputs and two are outputs. When connected to a battery or other DC source, the 4-way switch selects from either normal or reversed polarity. Such switches can also be used as intermediate switches in a [[multiway switching]] system for control of lamps by more than two switches.

==Light switches==
{{main|Light switch}}
In building wiring, light switches are installed at convenient locations to control lighting and occasionally other circuits. By use of multiple-pole switches, [[multiway switching]] control of a lamp can be obtained from two or more places, such as the ends of a corridor or stairwell. A [[wireless light switch]] allows remote control of lamps for convenience; some lamps include a [[touch switch]] which electronically controls the lamp if touched anywhere. In public buildings  several types of [[vandal resistant switch]]es are used to prevent unauthorized use.

==Slide switches==
Slide switches are mechanical switches using a slider that moves (slides) from the open (off) position to the closed (on) position.

==Electronic switches==
[[File:Tactile switches.jpg|thumb|right|Three push button switches (Tactile Switches). Major scale is inches.]]
{{see also|Electronic switch}}
A [[relay]] is an electrically operated switch. Many relays use an electromagnet to operate a switching mechanism mechanically, but other operating principles are also used. [[Solid-state relays]] control power circuits with no moving parts, instead using a semiconductor device to perform switching—often a [[silicon-controlled rectifier]] or [[TRIAC|triac]].

The [[analogue switch]] uses two [[MOSFET]] transistors in a [[transmission gate]] arrangement as a switch that works much like a relay, with some advantages and several limitations compared to an electromechanical relay.

The power transistor(s) in a [[switching voltage regulator]], such as a [[power supply unit (computer)|power supply unit]], are used like a switch to alternately let power flow and block power from flowing.

Many people use [[metonymy]] to call a variety of devices "switches" that conceptually connect or disconnect signals and communication paths between electrical devices, analogous to the way mechanical switches connect and disconnect paths for electrons to flow between two conductors. Early telephone systems used an automatically operated [[Strowger switch]] to connect telephone callers; telephone exchanges contain one or more [[crossbar switch]]es today.

Since the advent of [[digital logic]] in the 1950s, the term ''switch'' has spread to a variety of digital [[active device]]s such as [[transistor]]s and [[logic gate]]s whose function is to change their output state between two [[logic level]]s or connect different [[Digital signal (electronics)|signal]] lines, and even computers, [[network switch]]es, whose function is to provide connections between different [[computer port (hardware)|ports]] in a [[computer network]]. The term 'switched' is also applied to [[telecommunications network]]s, and signifies a network that is [[circuit switched]], providing dedicated circuits for communication between end nodes, such as the [[public switched telephone network]]. The common feature of all these usages is they refer to devices that control a [[binary numeral system|binary]] [[State (computing)|state]]: they are either ''on'' or ''off'', ''closed'' or ''open'', ''connected'' or ''not connected''.

'''Technology''' ("science of craft", from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|τέχνη}}, ''techne'', "art, skill, cunning of hand"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[wikt:-logia|-logia]]''&lt;ref name="Liddell 1980"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Greek-English Lexicon (Abridged Edition)|first=Henry George|last2=Scott|first2=Robert|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1980|isbn=978-0199102075|location=United Kingdom|pages=|quote=|via=|author=Liddell|title-link=A Greek-English Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the collection of [[Art techniques and materials|techniques]], [[skill]]s, [[wikt:method|methods]], and [[Business process|processes]] used in the production of [[Good (economics)|goods]] or [[Service (economics)|services]] or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as [[scientific investigation]]. Technology can be the [[knowledge]] of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in [[machines]] to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings.

The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic [[tool]]s. The [[prehistory|prehistoric]] discovery of [[Control of fire by early humans|how to control fire]] and the later [[Neolithic Revolution]] increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the [[wheel]] helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the [[printing press]], the [[telephone]], and the [[Internet]], have lessened physical barriers to [[communication]] and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.

Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced [[economy|economies]] (including today's [[economic globalization|global economy]]) and has allowed the rise of a [[Conspicuous leisure|leisure class]]. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as [[pollution]] and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's [[natural environment|environment]]. Innovations have always influenced the [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]] of a society and raised new questions of the [[ethics of technology]].  Examples include the rise of the notion of [[efficiency]] in terms of human [[productivity]], and the challenges of [[bioethics]].

Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the [[human condition]] or worsens it. [[Neo-Luddism]], [[anarcho-primitivism]], and similar [[reactionary]] movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as [[transhumanism]] and [[techno-progressivism]] view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the [[human condition]].

[[File:Handtiegelpresse von 1811.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The spread of paper and printing to the West, as in this [[printing press]], helped [[scientist]]s and [[politician]]s communicate their ideas easily, leading to the [[Age of Enlightenment]]; an example of technology as cultural force.]]
The use of the term "technology" has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon in English, and it was used either to refer to the description or study of the [[useful arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Universal Technological Dictionary, or Familiar Explanation of the Terms Used in All Arts and Sciences|last=Crabb|first=George|publisher=Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy|year=1823|isbn=|location=London|page=524|quote=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to allude to technical education, as in the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (chartered in 1861).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind and Hand: The Birth of MIT|last=Mannix|first=Loretta H.|last2=Stratton|first2=Julius Adams|publisher=MIT Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0262195249|location=Cambridge|pages=190–92|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "technology" rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the [[Second Industrial Revolution]]. The term's meanings changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists, beginning with [[Thorstein Veblen]], translated ideas from the German concept of ''[[:de:Technik|Technik]]'' into "technology." In German and other European languages, a distinction exists between ''technik'' and ''technologie'' that is absent in English, which usually translates both terms as "technology." By the 1930s, "technology" referred not only to the study of the [[industrial arts]] but to the industrial arts themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Technik Comes to America: Changing Meanings of Technology Before 1930|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, the American sociologist Read Bain wrote that "technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Technology and State Government|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=2|issue=6|page=860|doi=10.2307/2084365|jstor=2084365|year=1937|last1=Bain|first1=Read}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bain's definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists.  Scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as [[applied science]], rather than as the things that people make and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Shaping of Technology|last=MacKenzie|first=Donald A.|last2=Wajcman|first2=Judy|publisher=Open University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0335199136|edition=2nd|location=Buckingham|pages=|chapter=Introductory Essay|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of "technique" to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]]'s work on [[technologies of the self]] (''techniques de soi'').

Dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions. The ''[[Merriam-Webster's Advanced Learner's English Dictionary|Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary]]'' offers a definition of the term: "the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems" and "a machine, piece of equipment, method, etc., that is created by technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/technology|title=Technology {{!}} Definition of Technology by Merriam-Webster|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Merriam-Webster|access-date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ursula Franklin]], in her 1989 "Real World of Technology" lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is "practice, the way we do things around here."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Real World of Technology|last=Franklin|first=Ursula|publisher=House of Anansi|year=1999|isbn=978-0887848919|edition=revised|location=Scarborough|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used to imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to [[high technology]] or just [[consumer electronics]], rather than technology as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology|title=Technology|last=|first=|date=|work=BBC News|access-date=7 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Stiegler]], in ''[[Technics and Time, 1]]'', defines technology in two ways: as "the pursuit of life by means other than life," and as "organized inorganic matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stiegler |first=Bernard | title=Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus | year=1998 |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] | isbn=978-0804730419 | pages=17, 82|title-link=Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus }} Stiegler has more recently stated that [[biotechnology]] can no longer be defined as "organized inorganic matter," given that it is, rather, "the reorganization of the organic." {{cite book | last=Stiegler |first=Bernard | title=L'avenir du passé: Modernité de l'archéologie | year=2008 |publisher=La Découverte | isbn=978-2707154958 | page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]] or wooden [[spoon]], or more complex machines, such as a [[space station]] or [[particle accelerator]]. Tools and machines need not be material; {{anchor|Virtual technology}}virtual technology, such as [[computer software]] and [[business method]]s, fall under this definition of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c6/c6s5.htm|title=Industry, Technology and the Global Marketplace: International Patenting Trends in Two New Technology Areas|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/5902/20150818090057/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind02/c6/c6s5.htm|archive-date=18 August 2005|dead-url=yes|website=Science and Engineering Indicators 2002|accessdate=7 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. Brian Arthur]] defines technology in a similarly broad way as "a means to fulfill a human purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arthur |first=W. Brian |date=2009 |title=The Nature of Technology |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |page=28 |isbn=978-1416544050 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "technology" can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques. In this context, it is the current state of humanity's knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products, to solve problems, fulfill needs, or satisfy wants; it includes technical methods, skills, processes, techniques, tools and raw materials. When combined with another term, such as "medical technology" or "space technology," it refers to the state of the respective field's knowledge and tools. "[[State-of-the-art]] technology" refers to the [[high technology]] available to humanity in any field.

[[File:C4004 (Intel).jpg|thumb|right|The invention of integrated circuits and the [[microprocessor]] (here, an [[Intel 4004]] chip from 1971) led to the modern [[computer revolution]].]]
Technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Borgmann | first=Albert | authorlink=Albert Borgmann | year=2006 | title=Technology as a Cultural Force: For Alena and Griffin | journal=The Canadian Journal of Sociology | volume=31 | issue=3 | pages=351–60 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/canadian_journal_of_sociology/v031/31.3borgmann.html | format=fee required | accessdate=16 February 2007 | doi=10.1353/cjs.2006.0050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, technology is the application of math, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known. A modern example is the rise of [[communication]] technology, which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures; the rise of [[cyberculture]] has at its basis the development of the [[Internet]] and the [[computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://macek.czechian.net/defining_cyberculture.htm | title=Defining Cyberculture | accessdate=25 May 2007 | author=Macek, Jakub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all technology enhances culture in a creative way; technology can also help facilitate [[political oppression]] and war via tools such as guns. As a cultural activity, technology predates both [[science]] and [[engineering]], each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor.

==Science, engineering and technology==
[[File:Zoom lunette ardente.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Lavoisier]] conducting an experiment with combustion generated by amplified sun light]]
The distinction between science, engineering, and technology is not always clear. [[Science]] is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/science|title=Science|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Dictionary.com|publisher=|access-date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, because they have to satisfy requirements such as [[utility]], [[usability]], and [[safety]].{{Citation needed|reason=This implies that some technologies are not product of science if they have utility, that seems wrong|date=August 2017}}

Engineering is the [[goal-oriented]] process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, [[mathematics|mathematical]], [[language|linguistic]], and [[history|historical]] knowledge, to achieve some practical result.

Technology is often a consequence of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of [[electron]]s in [[electrical conductor]]s by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as [[semiconductor]]s, [[computer]]s, and other forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intute.ac.uk/sciences/ |title=Intute: Science, Engineering and Technology |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Intute]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217141847/http://www.intute.ac.uk/sciences/ |archive-date=17 February 2007 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=17 February 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists, historians, and policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science. In the immediate wake of [[World War II]], for example, it was widely considered in the United States that technology was simply "applied science" and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time. An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in [[Vannevar Bush]]'s treatise on postwar science policy, ''Science – The Endless Frontier'': "New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature&amp;nbsp;... This essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/nsf50/vbush1945.htm#summary|title=Science the Endless Frontier|last=Bush|first=Vannevar|date=July 1945|website=|publisher=National Science Foundation|access-date=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late-1960s, however, this view came under direct attack, leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks (initiatives resisted by the scientific community). The issue remains contentious, though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wise|first=George|year=1985|title=Science and Technology|journal=Osiris (2nd Series)|volume=1|pages=229–46|doi=10.1086/368647|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Between Politics and Science: Assuring the Integrity and Productivity of Research|last=Guston|first=David H.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0521653183|location=New York|pages=|quote=|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of tools by [[Homo (genus)|early humans]] was partly a process of discovery and of evolution.

Approximately 50,000 years ago, the use of tools and [[behavioral modernity|complex set of behaviors]] emerged, believed by many archaeologists to be connected to the emergence of fully modern [[language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/15/science/early-voices-the-leap-to-language.html|title=Early Voices: The Leap to Language|last=Wade|first=Nicholas|date=15 July 2003|work=The New York Times|access-date=7 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era were [[clothing]] and shelter; the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly, but they were a key to humanity's progress.

[[File:Néolithique 0001.jpg|thumb|An array of Neolithic artifacts, including bracelets, axe heads, chisels, and polishing tools]]

Human's technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the [[Neolithic]] Period ("New Stone Age"). The invention of polished [[stone axe]]s was a major advance that allowed [[deforestation|forest clearance]] on a large scale to create farms. This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic, but were originally used in the preceding [[Mesolithic]] in some areas such as [[Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Driscoll|first1=Killian|title=The early prehistory in the west of Ireland: Investigations into the social archaeology of the Mesolithic, west of the Shannon, Ireland|date=2006|url=http://lithicsireland.ie/mlitt_mesolithic_west_ireland_chap_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agriculture]] fed larger populations, and the transition to [[sedentism]] allowed simultaneously raising more children, as infants no longer needed to be carried, as [[nomad]]ic ones must. Additionally, children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the [[hunter-gatherer]] economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/01/060103114116.htm|title=The First Baby Boom: Skeletal Evidence Shows Abrupt Worldwide Increase In Birth Rate During Neolithic Period|last=University of Chicago Press Journals|first=|date=4 January 2006|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=7 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child Transport, Family Size, and Increase in Human Population During the Neolithic|journal=[[Current Anthropology]]|author=Sussman, Robert W. |author2=Hall, Roberta L. |volume=13|issue=2| pages=258–67|date=April 1972|doi=10.1086/201274 |jstor=2740977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first uses of iron alloys such as [[steel]] dates to around 1800 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The significance of the composition of excavated iron fragments taken from Stratum III at the site of Kaman-Kalehöyük, Turkey|journal=Anatolian Archeological Studies|volume=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200903261611.htm |title=Ironware piece unearthed from Turkey found to be oldest steel |last= |first= |date=26 March 2009 |work=The Hindu |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329111924/http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200903261611.htm |archive-date=29 March 2009 |dead-url=yes |access-date=8 November 2016 |via= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Energy and transport====
[[File:Wheel Iran.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[wheel]] was invented circa 4000 BCE.]]
{{Main article|History of transport}}
Meanwhile, humans were learning to harness other forms of energy. The earliest known use of wind power is the [[sailing ship]]; the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a Nile boat dating to the 8th millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The oldest representation of a Nile boat|journal=Antiquity|volume=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; From prehistoric times, Egyptians probably used the power of the annual [[flooding of the Nile]] to irrigate their lands, gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and "catch" basins. The ancient [[Sumer]]ians in [[Mesopotamia]] used a complex system of canals and levees to divert water from the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers for irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crawford|first=Harriet|date=2013|title=The Sumerian World|location=New York City, New York and London, England|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0203096604|pages=34–43|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qSOYAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=Sumerian+irrigation#v=onepage&amp;q=Sumerian%20irrigation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to archaeologists, the [[wheel]] was invented around 4000 BCE probably independently and nearly simultaneously in Mesopotamia (in present-day [[Iraq]]), the Northern Caucasus ([[Maykop culture]]) and Central Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East|last=Potts|first=D.T.|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=|page=285|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates on when this may have occurred range from 5500 to 3000 BCE with most experts putting it closer to 4000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Light on the Most Ancient East|last=Childe|first=V.

=== Medieval and modern history (300 CE&amp;nbsp;– present) ===
{{Main article|Medieval technology|Renaissance technology|Industrial Revolution|Second Industrial Revolution|Information Technology|Productivity improving technologies (economic history)}}

Innovations continued through the [[Middle Ages]] with innovations such as [[silk]], the [[horse collar]] and [[horseshoe]]s in the first few hundred years after the fall of the [[Roman Empire]]. [[Medieval technology]] saw the use of [[simple machine]]s (such as the [[lever]], the [[screw]], and the [[pulley]]) being combined to form more complicated tools, such as the [[wheelbarrow]], [[windmill]]s and [[clock]]s. The [[Renaissance technology|Renaissance]] brought forth many of these innovations, including the [[printing press]] (which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge), and technology became increasingly associated with [[science]], beginning a cycle of mutual advancement. The advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food, followed by the wider availability of consumer goods.

[[File:Late model Ford Model T.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|The [[automobile]] revolutionized personal transportation.]]
Starting in the United Kingdom in the 18th century, the [[Industrial Revolution]] was a period of great technological discovery, particularly in the areas of [[British Agricultural Revolution|agriculture]], [[manufacturing]], [[mining]], [[metallurgy]], and [[transport]], driven by the discovery of [[steam power]]. Technology took another step in a [[second industrial revolution]] with the harnessing of [[electricity]] to create such innovations as the [[electric motor]], [[light bulb]], and countless others. Scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for [[flight|powered flight]] and advancements in [[medicine]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]]. The rise in technology has led to [[skyscraper]]s and broad [[urban area]]s whose inhabitants rely on [[motor]]s to transport them and their food supply. Communication was also greatly improved with the invention of the [[telegraph]], [[telephone]], [[radio]] and [[television]]. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the [[airplane]] and [[automobile]].

[[File:USAF F-16A F-15C F-15E Desert Storm edit2.jpg|thumb|[[F-15]] and [[F-16]] flying over [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] during the [[Gulf War]] in 1991.]]
The 20th century brought a host of innovations. In [[physics]], the discovery of [[nuclear fission]] has led to both [[nuclear weapons]] and [[nuclear power]]. [[Computers]] were also invented and later [[miniaturization|miniaturized]] utilizing [[transistor]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s. [[Information technology]] subsequently led to the creation of the [[Internet]], which ushered in the current [[Information Age]]. Humans have also been able to [[space exploration|explore space]] with [[satellite]]s (later used for [[telecommunication]]) and in manned missions going all the way to the moon. In medicine, this era brought innovations such as [[Cardiac surgery|open-heart surgery]] and later [[stem cell treatments|stem cell therapy]] along with new [[pharmaceutical drug|medications]] and treatments.

Complex [[manufacturing]] and [[construction]] techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain these new technologies, and entire [[industry|industries]] have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools. Modern technology increasingly relies on training and education&amp;nbsp;– their designers, builders, maintainers, and users often require sophisticated general and specific training. Moreover, these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have been created to support them, including [[engineering]], [[medicine]], and [[computer science]], and other fields have been made more complex, such as [[construction]], [[transportation]], and [[architecture]].

==Philosophy==
===Technicism===
Generally, technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collins English Dictionary|last=|first=|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2011|isbn=978-0007437863|editor-last=Breslin|editor-first=Gerry|location=|pages=|chapter=technicism|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken to an extreme, technicism "reflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to control reality, to resolve all problems with the use of scientific–technological methods and tools."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Philosophical and Ethical Problems of Technicism and Genetic Engineering|journal=Society for Philosophy and Technology|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology. Some, such as Stephen V. Monsma,&lt;ref name="Monsma 1986"&gt;{{cite book| last = Monsma | first = Stephen V.| publisher = W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co|location= [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]]| title = Responsible Technology | year= 1986| isbn = 978-0802801753 }}&lt;/ref&gt; connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher [[moral authority]].

===Optimism===
{{See also|Extropianism}}
Optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as [[transhumanism]] and [[singularitarianism]], which view [[technological evolution|technological development]] as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition. In these ideologies, technological development is morally good.

Transhumanists generally believe that the point of technology is to overcome barriers, and that what we commonly refer to as the [[human condition]] is just another barrier to be surpassed.

Singularitarians believe in some sort of "[[accelerating change]]"; that the rate of technological progress accelerates as we obtain more technology, and that this will culminate in a "[[Technological singularity|Singularity]]" after [[artificial general intelligence]] is invented in which progress is nearly infinite; hence the term. Estimates for the date of this Singularity vary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://intelligence.org/ie-faq/#WhenWillTheSingularity|title=Intelligence Explosion FAQ|last=Muehlhauser|first=Luke|date=10 November 2015|website=|publisher=[[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]]|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but prominent futurist [[Ray Kurzweil]] estimates the Singularity will occur in 2045.

Kurzweil is also known for his history of the universe in six epochs: (1) the physical/chemical epoch, (2) the life epoch, (3) the human/brain epoch, (4) the technology epoch, (5) the artificial intelligence epoch, and (6) the universal colonization epoch. Going from one epoch to the next is a Singularity in its own right, and a period of speeding up precedes it. Each epoch takes a shorter time, which means the whole history of the universe is one giant Singularity event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|publisher=Penguin|year=2005|isbn=978-1101218884|location=|pages=|chapter=The Six Epochs|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics see these ideologies as examples of [[scientism]] and [[techno-utopianism]] and fear the notion of [[human enhancement]] and [[technological singularity]] which they support. Some have described [[Karl Marx]] as a techno-optimist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.changesurfer.com/Acad/DemocraticTranshumanism.htm|title=Democratic Transhumanism 2.0|last=Hughes|first=James|date=|website=Changesurfer|publisher=|access-date=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skepticism and critics===
{{See also|Luddite|Neo-Luddism|Anarcho-primitivism|Bioconservatism}}
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Refer to caption|[[Luddites]] smashing a power loom in 1812]]
On the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[John Zerzan]], who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed. They suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health.

Many, such as the [[Luddites]] and prominent philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]], hold serious, although not entirely, deterministic reservations about technology (see "[[The Question Concerning Technology]]"&lt;ref name="Heidegger 1977"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lovitt | first = William | chapter = The Question Concerning Technology | year= 1977 | chapter-url = http://www.culturaleconomics.atfreeweb.com/Anno/Heidegger%20The%20Question%201954.htm | accessdate=21 November 2007 | title = The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays | publisher = Harper Torchbooks | pages = 3–35 | isbn = 978-0613913140}}&lt;/ref&gt;). According to Heidegger scholars [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and Charles Spinosa, "Heidegger does not oppose technology. He hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that 'in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or, what comes to the same thing, to rebel helplessly against it.' Indeed, he promises that 'when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology, we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1977|isbn=|location=New York|pages=25–26|translator-last=Lovitt|translator-first=W.|chapter=The Question Concerning Technology|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either techno-optimists or techno-pessimists tend to allow."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophical Romanticism|last=Dreyfus|first=Hubert|last2=Spinosa|first2=Charles|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=|editor-last=Kompridis|editor-first=Nikolas|location=New York|pages=265–81|chapter=Further Reflections on Heidegger, Technology, and the Everyday|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics such as [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', [[Anthony Burgess]]'s ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', and [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. In [[Goethe's Faust|Goethe's ''Faust'']], Faust selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology. More recently, modern works of science fiction such as those by [[Philip K. Dick]] and [[William Gibson]] and films such as ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technology's impact on human society and identity.

The late cultural critic [[Neil Postman]] distinguished tool-using societies from technological societies and from what he called "technopolies," societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices, values, and world-views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology|last=Postman|first=Neil|publisher=Vintage|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Darin Barney]] has written about technology's impact on practices of [[citizenship]] and democratic culture, suggesting that technology can be construed as (1) an object of political debate, (2) a means or medium of discussion, and (3) a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship. As a setting for democratic culture, Barney suggests that technology tends to make [[ethics|ethical]] questions, including the question of what a good life consists in, nearly impossible because they already give an answer to the question: a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Nation Under Google|last=Barney|first=Darin|publisher=House of Anansi Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Toronto|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolas Kompridis]] has also [http://www.parrhesiajournal.org/parrhesia08/parrhesia08_kompridis.pdf written] about the dangers of new technology, such as [[genetic engineering]], [[nanotechnology]], [[synthetic biology]], and [[robotics]]. He warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings, including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature. These concerns are shared by other philosophers, scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues (e.g. [[Francis Fukuyama]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Bill Joy|William Joy]], and [[Michael Sandel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Technology's Challenge to Democracy|journal=Parrhesia|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another prominent critic of technology is [[Hubert Dreyfus]], who has published books such as ''On the Internet'' and ''What Computers Still Can't Do''.

A more infamous anti-technological treatise is ''[[s:Industrial Society and Its Future|Industrial Society and Its Future]]'', written by the Unabomber [[Ted Kaczynski]] and printed in several major newspapers (and later books) as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the techno-industrial infrastructure. There are also subcultures that disapprove of some or most technology, such as self-identified [[off-gridder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Vannini, Phillip, and Jonathan Taggart. "Voluntary simplicity, involuntary complexities, and the pull of remove: The radical ruralities of off-grid lifestyles." Environment and Planning A 45.2 (2013): 295-311.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appropriate technology===
{{See also|Technocriticism|Technorealism}}
The notion of [[appropriate technology]] was developed in the 20th century by thinkers such as [[E.F. Schumacher]] and [[Jacques Ellul]] to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized [[infrastructure]] or parts or skills imported from elsewhere. The [[ecovillage]] movement emerged in part due to this concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lunner-Kolstrup|first=Christina|last2=Hörndahl|first2=Torsten|last3=Karttunen|first3=Janne P.|date=2018-07-03|title=Farm operators' experiences of advanced technology and automation in Swedish agriculture: a pilot study|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=215–26|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1458670|pmid=30047856|issn=1059-924X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optimism and skepticism in the 21st century===
''This section mainly focuses on American concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other Western countries. ''

{{Quotation|The inadequate quantity and quality of American jobs is one of the most fundamental economic challenges we face. [...] What's the linkage between technology and this fundamental problem?|Bernstein, Jared|"It’s Not a Skills Gap That’s Holding Wages Down: It’s the Weak
Economy, Among Other Things," in ''[[The American Prospect]]''|October 2014}}

In his article, [[Jared Bernstein]], a Senior Fellow at the [[Center on Budget and Policy Priorities]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbpp.org/jared-bernstein|title=Jared Bernstein|last=|first=|date=2013-09-13|website=|publisher=[[Center for Budget and Policy Priorities]]|access-date=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; questions the widespread idea that [[automation]], and more broadly, technological advances, have mainly contributed to this growing [[labor market]] problem.
His thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism. Essentially, he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and American issues concerning [[unemployment]] and declining wages.

He uses two main arguments to defend his point.
First, because of recent technological advances, an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs. Yet, scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved. Indeed, [[automation]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;threatens repetitive jobs but higher-end jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that "requires flexibility judgment and common sense"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=It's Not a Skills Gap That's Holding Wages Down: It's the Weak Economy, Among Other Things|journal=The American Prospect|volume=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; remain hard to replace with [[machine]]s. Second, studies have not shown clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades.

Therefore, according to Bernstein, instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current American increasing unemployment and declining wages, one needs to worry more about "bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand, trade, income, and opportunity."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

For people who use both the Internet and mobile devices in excessive quantities it is likely for them to experience [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and over exhaustion as a result of disruptions in their sleeping patterns. Continuous studies have shown that increased [[Body mass index|BMI]] and weight gain are associated with people who spend long hours online and not exercising frequently.&lt;ref&gt;7.Kim JH 2010 ~Kim JH, Lau C, Cheuk K-K, Kan P, Hui HL, Griffiths SM.

Statistically, teens reportedly have fourfold the amount of road traffic incidents as those who are 20 years or older, and a very high percentage of adolescents write (81%) and read (92%) texts while driving.&lt;ref&gt;Kim JH 2010 ~Kim JH, Lau C, Cheuk K-K, Kan P, Hui HL, Griffiths SM. Brief report:predictors of heavy internet use and associations with health promoting and health risk behaviors among Hong Kong university students. J Adolesc. 2010;33(1):215–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, mass media and technology have a negative impact on people, on both their mental and physical health.

===Complex technological systems===
[[Thomas P. Hughes]] stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems, we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human-Built World: How to Think About Technology and Culture|last=Hughes|first=Thomas P.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0226359335|location=Chicago|pages=1–11|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is the difference between a [[wheel]] or a [[compass]] and cooking machines such as an [[oven]] or a [[gas stove]]? Can we consider all of them, only a part of them, or none of them as technologies?

Technology is often considered too narrowly; according to Hughes, "Technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity".&lt;ref name="Hughes, Thomas P. 2004"&gt;Hughes, Thomas P. (2004) "Introduction: Complex Technology" (1–11) in "Human-Built World: How to Think About Technology and Culture"&lt;/ref&gt; This definitio's emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded definitions that may mistakenly include cooking "technologies," but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems.

Yet, because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies, Hughes argues that [[engineer]]s, [[scientist]]s, and [[Management|managers]] have often believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want. They have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, [[Evgeny Morozov]] particularly challenges two concepts: "Internet-centrism" and "solutionism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=To Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism|last=Morozov|first=Evgeny|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2013|isbn=978-1610391399|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet-centrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the Internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces. Solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet. In fact, technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations. According to [[Alexis Madrigal]]'s review of Morozov's theory, to ignore it will lead to "unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/03/toward-a-complex-realistic-and-moral-tech-criticism/273996/|title=Toward a Complex, Realistic, and Moral Tech Criticism|last=Madrigal|first=Alexis C.|date=13 March 2013|work=The Atlantic|access-date=11 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benjamin R. Cohen and Gwen Ottinger also discussed the multivalent effects of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Benjamin |last1=Cohen |first2=Gwen |last2=Ottinger |editor-first1=Gwen |editor-last1=Ottinger |editor-first2=Benjamin |editor-last2=Cohen| chapter=Introduction: Environmental Justice and the Transformation of Science and Engineering |date=2011 |pages=1–18 |title=Technoscience and Environmental Justice: Expert Cultures in a Grassroots Movement |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0262015790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, recognition of the limitations of technology, and more broadly, scientific knowledge, is needed&amp;nbsp;– especially in cases dealing with [[environmental justice]] and health issues. Ottinger continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers’ new comprehension of their role. Such an approach of technology and science "[require] technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently. [They have to consider themselves as] collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Gwen |last1= Ottinger |editor-first1=Gwen |editor-last1=Ottinger |editor-first2=Benjamin |editor-last2=Cohen |title=Technoscience and Environmental Justice: Expert Cultures in a Grassroots Movement |date=2011 |pages=229–48 |chapter=Rupturing Engineering Education: Opportunities for Transforming Expert Identities Through Community-Based Projects |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0262015790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitiveness==
Technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function. The science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane, but it is all technology, and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage.

Technology-based planning is what was used to build the US industrial giants before WWII (e.g., [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow]], [[DuPont]], [[General Motors|GM]]) and it is what was used to transform the US into a [[superpower]]. It was not economic-based planning.

==Future technology==
{{main article|Emerging technologies}}

[[Theories of technology]] often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the [[high technology]] and science of the time. As with all predictions of the future, however, technology's is uncertain.

In 2005, futurist [[Ray Kurzweil]] predicted that the future of technology would mainly consist of an overlapping "GNR Revolution" of [[genetics]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[robotics]], with robotics being the most important of the three.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Singularity is Near|last=Kurzweil|first=Ray|publisher=Penguin|year=2005|isbn=978-1101218884|location=|pages=|chapter=GNR: Three Overlapping Revolutions|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16485">'''Teledermatology''' is a subspecialty in the medical field of [[dermatology]] and probably one of the most common applications of [[telemedicine]] and [[e-health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ATA Teledermatology SIG | url = http://www.atmeda.org/icot/sigtelederm.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070202162157/http://www.atmeda.org/icot/sigtelederm.htm | archive-date = 2 February 2007 | dead-url = yes | publisher = American Telemedicine Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; In teledermatology, telecommunication technologies are used to exchange medical information (concerning [[skin]] conditions and [[tumours]] of the skin) over a distance using audio, visual and data communication. Applications comprise health care management such as diagnoses, consultation and treatment as well as (continuous) education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Wootton R | veditors = Wootton R, Craig J, Patterson V | chapter = Realtime Telemedicine |title=Introduction to Telemedicine | publisher = CRC Press | date = December 2017 |isbn=978-1-351-98946-6 |edition=Second | page = 88 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hApEDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Wurm_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wurm EM, Hofmann-Wellenhof R, Wurm R, Soyer HP | year = 2007 | title = Telemedizin und Teledermatologie: Vergangenheit Gegenwart und Zukunft | url = | journal = JDDG | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 106–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Burg_2005"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Burg G, Soyer HP, Chimenti S | date = 2005 | chapter = Teledermatology | veditors = Frisch P, Burgdorf W | title = EDF White Book, Skin Diseases in Europe | location = Berlin | pages = 130–133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dermatologists Perednia and Brown were the first to coin the term "teledermatology" in 1995. In a scientific publication, they described the value of a teledermatologic service in a rural area underserved by dermatologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perednia DA, Brown NA | year = 1995 | title = Teledermatology: one application of telemedicine | url = | journal = Bull Med Libr Assoc | volume = 83 | issue = 1| pages = 42–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modes of data transmission==
Teledermatology (as telemedicine) is practised on the basis of two concepts: '''[[Store and forward]] (SAF)''' and '''real time/live interactive teledermatology'''. Hybrid modes also exist (combining SAF and real time applications).

The SAF method is most commonly used in teledermatology: It involves sending (forwarding) digital images associated with (anonymous) medical information to the data storage unit of a consulted specialist. It can be as easy as sending an email with a digital image of a lesion to seek advice for a skin condition. Advantages of this method are that it does not demand the presence of both parties at the same time and does not usually require expensive equipment.

In real-time/ live interactive teledermatology applications, provider and individuals usually interact via live [[videoconferencing]]. It may also involve [[remote surgery]] and the use of telerobotic microscopes in dermatopathology. This mode generally requires more sophisticated and costly technology than used in the SAF mode. Both participants must be available at the same time.

==Areas of application==

===Health care management===
'''Direct consultation''' involves an individual with a skin condition contacting a dermatologist via [[telecommunication]] to request diagnosis and treatment. In this field, mobile applications of teledermatology gain importance.

[[Telediagnosis]] in the absence of personal contact with health care workers to the individual is complex. It requires active participation of the individual and without appropriate guidance may lead to improper management. However, as a [[triage]] tool, leading the individual directly to the appropriate specialist for his/her disease, it could be very valuable in the near future.

'''Specialist referral''' is a major area of application in teledermatology A general practitioner (or other medical professional) that sees the individual consults a specialist/ specialised centre via [[telecommunication]] in order to get a second opinion. The specialist then helps the GP in rendering a diagnosis, providing management options et cetera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Telederm.org | url = http://www.telederm.org/ | publisher = eDermConsult }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Home telehealth/telehomecare''' involves an individual with a chronic condition being examined and managed remotely at home. An important field of interest of telehomecare in dermatology is the follow-up treatment of individuals with skin conditions requiring regular follow-up such as crural ulcers. Crural ulcers are a common [[skin]] condition that needs follow up visits up to twice a week demanding significant time commitments by the individuals in addition to causing a financial burden on the health care system. Teledermatology can help to reduce the time and costs involved in the follow-up of such conditions.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | vauthors = Binder B, Hofmann-Wellenhof R, Salmhofer W, Okcu A, Kerl H, Soyer HP | title = Teledermatological monitoring of leg ulcers in cooperation with home care nurses | journal = Archives of Dermatology | volume = 143 | issue = 12 | pages = 1511–4 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18086999 | doi = 10.1001/archderm.143.12.1511 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and information===
'''Medical education/continuous education''' are a major advantage of telemedicine/e-health. Numerous universities offer online courses, computer-based training and Web applications in this field principally aimed at medical students. Specialist training courses via internet are also available, particularly in [[dermoscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = IDD International Dermoscopy Diploma | url = http://www.medunigraz.at/IDD | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110113143842/https://www.medunigraz.at/IDD | archive-date = 13 January 2011 | dead-url = yes | publisher =  Medizinische Universität Graz }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''General medical/health information''' may be accessed by non-professionals, such as individuals affected by a skin condition, and their relatives, through the [[internet]]. They are also able to join peer support groups with others affected by the same condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = DermNet NZ | url = http://www.dermnetnz.org | publisher =  New Zealand Dermatological Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domains with special interest==

===Teledermoscopy===
In teledermoscopy, digital dermoscopic [[lesion]] images (with or without clinical images) are transmitted electronically to a specialist for examination. This can be done on the web-based telediagnostic network [http://www.campusmedicus.com Campus Medicus].

[[Dermoscopy]] (dermatoscopy, epiluminescence microscopy) is the technical field of using an epiluminescence [[microscope]] for viewing skin lesions in magnification in-vivo. It is particularly useful in the early detection of malignant skin lesions (i.e., melanoma). Digital dermoscopic images can be taken with a [[digital camera]] attached to a dermatoscope or special video cameras suited for dermoscopy, e.g. the [[Fotofinder|FotoFinder]]. Since dermoscopy is based on examination of a two-dimensional image it is very well suited for digital imaging and teledermatology.

===Teledermatopathology===
Teledermatopathology is the transmission of dermatopathologic images either in real-time with the aid of a robotic microscope or using a store-and-forward system (transmission as a single file). In the latter method (SAF) a rather new development is the introduction of virtual slide systems (VSS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Massone C, Soyer HP, Lozzi GP, Di Stefani A, Leinweber B, Gabler G, Asgari M, Boldrini R, Bugatti L, Canzonieri V, Ferrara G, Kodama K, Mehregan D, Rongioletti F, Janjua SA, Mashayekhi V, Vassilaki I, Zelger B, Zgavec B, Cerroni L, Kerl H | display-authors = 6 | title = Feasibility and diagnostic agreement in teledermatopathology using a virtual slide system | journal = Human Pathology | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 546–54 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17270240 | doi = 10.1016/j.humpath.2006.10.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual slides are made by digitally scanning an entire glass slide at a high [[Image resolution|resolution]] and then sending the images to a storage system. These can be then assessed on a computer screen similar to conventional microscopy, allowing the [[pathologist]] to maneuver around the image and view every part of the slide at any magnification.

===Teledermoscopically aided dermatopathology===
This is the transmission of crucial medical data and dermoscopic as well as clinical images to a pathologist who renders the conventional histopathologic diagnosis.

In the everyday clinical setting, skin [[biopsies]] are taken by the physician directly responsible for the individual and are assessed by a dermatopathologist. This pathologist has most likely never seen the clinical aspect of the lesion and might not have any information about the person. These limitations can be overcome by teledermoscopically aided dermatopathology whereby a patient history and clinical data may increase the sensitivity of [[diagnosis]].&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal | vauthors = Bauer J, Leinweber B, Metzler G, Blum A, Hofmann-Wellenhof R, Leitz N, Dietz K, Soyer HP, Garbe C | title = Correlation with digital dermoscopic images can help dermatopathologists to diagnose equivocal skin tumours | journal = The British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 155 | issue = 3 | pages = 546–51 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16911279 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2006.07342.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally it has been shown that provision of such data may improve the level of diagnostic confidence held by the assessing dermatopathologists.

===Mobile teledermatology===
Mobile telemedicine is a system in which at least one participant (the person seeking advice or the doctor, for instance) uses wireless or mobile equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Handyscope | url = https://www.fotofinder.de/en/technology/skin-cancer-diagnostics/handyscope/ | publisher = FotoFinder Systems GmbH }}&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e. mobile phones, handheld devices), in contrast to conventional stationary [[telemedicine]] platforms. Travellers who develop skin lesions as well as doctors who are on the move in hospital/non-hospital area can benefit from this new development in teledermatology. In order to facilitate access to medical advice and enable individuals to play a more active role in managing their own health status, mobile teledermatology seems to be especially suited for patient filtering or [[triage]]. (i.e. referral based on the severity and character of their skin condition). Another possible practical application is for follow-up of individuals with chronic skin conditions.

===Suitability of cases===
Not all cases are suitable for teledermatology. The type of cases suited for teledermatology is a topic, which requires more studies. Some studies have observed that eczema and follicular lesions were diagnosed with relatively more certainty, while in some other studies it was seen that diagnoses were made with more certainty in cases like viral warts, herpes zoster, acne vulgaris, irritant dermatitis, vitiligo, and superficial bacterial and fungal infections. Unlike in western studies where pigmented lesions suspicious of melanomas are one of the most referred cases for teledermatology (with or without teledermatoscopy), Asian studies have fewer cases referred based on the suspicion of melanoma.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal | vauthors = Kaliyadan F, Venkitakrishnan S | year = 2009 | title = Teledermatology: Clinical case profiles and practical issues | url = | journal = Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol | volume = 75 | issue = | pages = 32–5 | doi=10.4103/0378-6323.45217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implemented projects by country==

=== United Kingdom ===
24% of the population in England and Wales seek medical advice for a skin condition, and approximately 6% of patients presenting with a skin problem are referred for specialist advice each year.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield J, Grindlay D, Williams H. Skin conditions in the UK: a health care needs assessment. Nottingham: Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology, University of Nottingham, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Health encourages the use of digital technology in key areas to support delivery of the quality, innovation, productivity, and prevention (QIPP). This includes the introduction of digital or online services to deliver greater convenience for patients and to free up face-to-face clinical time for individuals who really need it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2011/12 | url = https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-operating-framework-for-the-nhs-in-england-2011-12 | work = Department of Health | publisher = GOV.UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
Teledermatology and teledermoscopy currently exist in different forms in Australia. They assist with combatting the high [[skin cancer]] rates and allows rural patients to access specialist advice without having to travel. However, [[Store and forward|store-and-forward]] teledermatology or teledermoscopy are not currently funded under the Australian national health scheme called [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]]. Research has been done into the economic impact of funding teledermoscopy in the Australian setting, finding that it would cost around $2 for every day that diagnosis or treatment was expedited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Snoswell CL, Caffery LJ, Whitty JA, Soyer HP, Gordon LG | title = Cost-effectiveness of Skin Cancer Referral and Consultation Using Teledermoscopy in Australia | journal = JAMA Dermatology | volume = 154 | issue = 6 | pages = 694–700 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29801161 | pmc = 6145645 | doi = 10.1001/jamadermatol.2018.0855 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian dermatologists have been reported as reflecting on teledermoscopy by saying "that it is valuable, [and] advanced dermatology service" but given the option "they would prefer face-to-face consultation with patients where possible to allow for a full body examination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Snoswell CL, Whitty JA, Caffery LJ, Finnane A, Soyer HP | title = What do Australian dermatologists expect to be paid for store-and-forward teledermoscopy?

A '''thermostatic radiator valve''' (TRV) is a self-regulating [[valve]] fitted to hot [[water heating]] system [[radiator (heating)|radiator]], to control the temperature of a room by changing the flow of hot water to the radiator.

== Functioning ==

The classic thermostatic radiator valve contains a plug, typically made of wax (forming a [[wax motor]]), which expands or contracts with the surrounding temperature. This plug is connected to a pin which in turn is connected to a valve.  The valve gradually closes as the temperature of the surrounding area increases, limiting the amount of hot water entering the radiator. This allows a maximum temperature to be set for each room.

As the valve works by sensing the temperature of the air surrounding it, it is important to ensure that it is not covered by material (such as curtains). If the controller is removed from the valve the valve turns on and the radiator will always be hot.

The replacement of a manual heating control with a TRV has been estimated to save at least {{convert|280|kg}} of CO{{sub|2}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Home-improvements-and-products/Heating-and-hot-water/Thermostats-and-heating-controls Energy Saving Trust (2011), Heating and hot water controls]&lt;/ref&gt; They are also considerably cost-efficient, using heat only when needed, and can reduce heating bills by up to 17 percent a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plumber-horsham.com/1/post/2014/03/thermostatic-radiator-valve-why-you-should-fit-them-in-your-home.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324095935/http://www.plumber-horsham.com/1/post/2014/03/thermostatic-radiator-valve-why-you-should-fit-them-in-your-home.html |archivedate=2014-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, electronic TRVs are becoming available which use electronic temperature sensing, and frequently contain programmers so that individual radiators may be programmed for different temperatures at different times of the day. Such increased control allows even better energy and CO{{sub|2}} saving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opentrv.org.uk/ OpenTRV aims to save 50% of space heating energy for typical UK home]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TIme-dependent neutronics and temperatures''' ('''TINTE''') is a two-group diffusion code for the study of nuclear and thermal behavior of high temperature reactors.  It was developed by [[Forschungszentrum Jülich]] in Germany, formally known as KFA ({{Lang-de|Kernforschungsanlage}}), to investigate [[Very high temperature reactor|HTGRs]] in 2D (r-Z) geometry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19273">The '''United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing, and Allied Workers of America''' ('''UCAPAWA''') was a labor union formed in 1937 and incorporated large numbers of Mexican, black, Asian, and Anglo food processing workers under its banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruiz|first=Vicki|title=Cannery Women Cannery Lives|year=1987|publisher=University of New Mexico Press.|location=Albaquerque|isbn=0-8263-1006-0|page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders envisioned a national decentralized labor organization with power flowing from the bottom up. Although it was a short-lived, the UCAPAWA influenced the lives of many workers and had a major impact for both women and minority workers in the union.

==History==
The United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing Allied Workers of America (or UCAPAWA) was an organization formed after the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL) ignored several delegate members plea to have better working conditions for farm and food processing workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruiz|first=Vicki|title=Cannery Women, Cannery Lives: Mexican Women, Unionization, and the California Food Processing Industry, 1930-1950|year=1987|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At its head stood an intense and energetic organizer named Donald Henderson who was a young economics instructor at [[Columbia University]] and a member of the [[Communist party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnesen|first=Eric|title=Encyclopedia of U.S Labor and Working-Class History, 3 Vol set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zEWsZ81Bd3YC&amp;pg=PA1414&amp;lpg=PA1414&amp;dq=donald+henderson+ucapawa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zAX815k3FJ&amp;sig=GNLaCSm2TISoyGWInyVqhOFpS0A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w6GnUartNYOtigL2toCIBA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC|accessdate=30 May 2013|pages=1414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson, who was also one of the founders of the People’s Congress, noted the importance this union placed on popularizing the conditions of black and Mexican American workers and organizing them as a way to improve their social and economic situation. Henderson declared that the “International Office was sufficiently concerned with the conditions facing . . . the Negro people and the Mexican and Spanish American peoples.” Henderson observed that both minority groups were deprived of civil rights, exploited to the point of starvation, kept in decayed housing, denied educational opportunities, and in Henderson’s view, “blocked from their own cultural development.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zaragosa|first=Vargas|title=Labor Rights Are Civil Rights: Mexican American Workers in Twentieth-Century America|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0-691-11546-X|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henderson eventually, as President of the union, established it as the agricultural arm of [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) in 1937 after having been abandoned by the AFL.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Joshua.  Shortest Straw: CPUSA in Labor Organizing,  Master's Thesis. Published by CSU Pomona Library, June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to persuade the AFL to charter an international union of agricultural workers and increasingly drawn to the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) industrial union structure, Henderson and representatives from locals throughout the country met in Denver in July 1937 to form UCAPAWA, which promptly received a charter from the CIO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnesen|first=Eric|title=Encyclopedia of U.S Labor and Working- Class History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zEWsZ81Bd3YC&amp;pg=PA1414&amp;lpg=PA1414&amp;dq=donald+henderson+ucapawa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zAX815k3FJ&amp;sig=GNLaCSm2TISoyGWInyVqhOFpS0A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w6GnUartNYOtigL2toCIBA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC|accessdate=30 May 2013|pages=1414}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the reason behind its founding was to address the concerns of agricultural laborers and their counterparts in packing and canning during the [[Great Depression]].

The UCAPAWA represented multi-cultural workers from Mexicans in sugar beet to black sharecroppers in Arkansas and Missouri. They were also very involved in [[Asian-American]] workers such as [[Filipino people|Filipino]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] cannery workers in Washington. UCAPAWA was particularly strong among Mexican and Mexican American workers. In 1940, the ''San Francisco News'' called UCAPAWA the "fastest growing agricultural union in California", and attributed its success to its appeal to Mexican and Mexican American workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = (title unknown)| work = San Francisco News| date = 1940-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The union was also supported by such outside organizations as the [[John Steinbeck Committee to Aid Agricultural Organization]], the J. Lubin Society, the Spanish-speaking Peoples Congress, and on occasion, local clergy.

A commitment to [[union democracy|trade union democracy]], shared by both national leaders and regular members provided the underlying philosophy for union endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruiz|first=Vicki|title=Cannery Women, Cannery Lives: Mexican Women, Unionization and the California Food Processing Industry, 1930-1950|year=1987|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=978-0826309884|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Some leaders of the UCAPAWA saw themselves as participants of a radical culture and political projects. When the UCAPAWA entered an affiliation the Arkansas-based [[Southern Tenant Farmers Union]] (STFU) there was controversy regarding political associations. Infighting between Communist party leaders and the local [[Socialists]] who served as the organization’s principal administrators, as well as personality and ideological conflicts marred the alliance from the start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnesen|first=Eric|title=Encyclopedia of United States Labor and Working-class History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zEWsZ81Bd3YC&amp;pg=PA1414&amp;lpg=PA1414&amp;dq=donald+henderson+ucapawa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zAX815k3FJ&amp;sig=GNLaCSm2TISoyGWInyVqhOFpS0A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w6GnUartNYOtigL2toCIBA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC|accessdate=30 May 2013|pages=1415}}&lt;/ref&gt;   According to the {{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of United States Labor and Working-class history}} both the STFU and UCAPAWA differed over a fundamental issue: Whether agricultural workers could best be served by a protest organization or a trade union. STFU thought that sharecroppers and tenant farmers could not be organized because they were uneducated and too poor.

The UCAPAWA disagreed and argued that agricultural workers could be taught the rudimentary procedures for running the locals and that union members had to support their own organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnesen|first=Eric|title=The Encyclopedia of United States Labor and Working-Class History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zEWsZ81Bd3YC&amp;pg=PA1414&amp;lpg=PA1414&amp;dq=donald+henderson+ucapawa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zAX815k3FJ&amp;sig=GNLaCSm2TISoyGWInyVqhOFpS0A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w6GnUartNYOtigL2toCIBA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC|accessdate=30 May 2013|pages=1414–1415}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Another difference between the STFU and UCAPAWA was that the STFU wanted a centralized government while the UCAPAWA believed in a more decentralized system. After the STFU departed, the UCAPAWA’s constitution guaranteed local autonomy and provided for local control of at least half of all dues collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruiz|first=Vicki|title=Cannery Women, Cannery Lives: Mexican Women, Unionization, and the California Food Processing Industry, 1930-1950|year=1987|publisher=University of New Mexico|isbn=978-0826309884|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The STFU dispute was a turning point for UCAPAWA. Agricultural unions did not have [[collective bargaining]] rights and often faced local hostility. As a result, UCAPAWA shifted its focus from the fields to processing plants.

The UCAPAWA distanced themselves further from conventional unions and organizations by representing working classes generally ignored by traditional craft affiliates. Union officers deliberately enlisted black, Mexican, Asian and female labor organizers in order to launch campaigns aimed at minorities and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruiz|first=Vicki|title=Cannery Women, Cannery Lives: Mexican Women, Unionization, and the California Food Processing Industry, 1930-1950|year=1987|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|isbn=978-0826309884|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UCAPAWA was spreading their wings from fields to fisheries, canneries, processing plants and even tobacco manufacturing workers. The UCAPAWA was fast becoming one of the more influential unions in America and when the 1939 [[Madera Cotton Strike]] happened the UCAPAWA proved they were a force to be reckoned with. Besides UCAPAWA proving themselves a strong union they were also beginning to acquire a reputation as a [[Communist Party]] (CP).

While some truly believe the demise of the UCAPAWA was caused by the involvement with the Radical Party, many members of UCAPAWA believed themselves to be more liberal than anything. The argument of whether the union leaders were supporters of Communism set off an argument between many local leaders. [[Vicki L. Ruiz]] makes a very important statement in her book {{cite book |title=Cannery Women, Cannery Lives: Mexican Women, Unionization, and the California Food Processing Industry, 1930-1950}} She writes that “UCAPAWA certainly had a leftist stance, though the nature and extent of its leftist ideology will continue to be debated.” Despite their roots or political stance, the UCAPAWA had shown that it could organize the nation’s most vulnerable workers. It also showed that women and minority groups were capable of playing an important role in the labor movement.

==Role of women==

One of the most prominent roles that UCAPAWA played was in the workplace for women, especially Mexican women. Forming half of UCAPAWA’s total membership, women were not silent partners. On the contrary, they performed various services ranging from negotiating contracts to calling numbers at bingo. Women organizing women became a union hallmark. Women enthusiastically joined a labor organization that actively encouraged their involvement and offered them genuine opportunities for leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruiz|first=Vicki L|title=Cannery Women Cannery Lives|year=1987|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albaquerque|isbn=0-8263-1006-0|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; UCAPAWA food and tobacco locals proved successful in securing higher wages and benefits that were particularly important to women. In fact, one of the most important positions, Vice President, was filled by [[Dorothy Ray Healey]].  Left-wing labor activists like Healey were successful because they embraced the Popular Front viewpoint and represented themselves as links to ethnic communities and as advocates of racial equality. Healey was assisted by a core group of college students and Young Communist League members who worked in the plant during the summer and were actively involved in organizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zaragosa|first=Vargas|title=Labor Rights Are Civil Rights: Mexican American Workers in Twentieth-Century America|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0-691-11546-X|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning, UCAPAWA had the financial support of the CIO, but there were hard times ahead for the newly-formed organization. UCAPAWA was one of the few labor unions that allowed women to hold positions of authority. There, they pushed for such benefits as [[maternity leave]] and [[equal pay]], and they were on the forefront in the struggle for women's equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trujillo |first=David |title=Labor Reaches Out |journal=Political Affairs Magazine |publisher=Communist Party, USA |date=December 2003 |url=http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/view/83/1/14 |accessdate=2006-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031152502/http://www.politicalaffairs.net/article/view/83/1/14/ |archivedate=October 31, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1937, Henderson could report a membership of over 120,000 workers in more than 300 locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnesen|first=Eric|title=Encyclopedia of U.S Labor and Working-Class History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zEWsZ81Bd3YC&amp;pg=PA1414&amp;lpg=PA1414&amp;dq=donald+henderson+ucapawa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zAX815k3FJ&amp;sig=GNLaCSm2TISoyGWInyVqhOFpS0A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=w6GnUartNYOtigL2toCIBA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC|accessdate=30 May 2013|pages=1414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1946, nearly nine of ten cannery contracts set the minimum wage at sixty-five cents an hour. Two thirds contained "equal pay for equal work" clauses. More importantly, three fourths provided leave of absence for pregnancy or other reasons without losing seniority. Four fifths of the agreements also included benefits as paid vacations as well as bonuses for night or swing shift work. More than half had stipulations concerning paid holidays, union input in setting piece rates, and overtime pay after forty hours per week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruiz|first=Vicki L|title=Cannery Women Cannery Lives|year=1987|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albaquerque|isbn=0-8263-1006-0|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1938 pecan-sheller's strike led by [[Emma Tenayuca]] in [[San Antonio]], UCAPAWA president Henderson dispatched organizer [[Luisa Moreno]] to turn the local, ''El Nogal'', into an efficient bargaining organization.  Tenayuca had by then already established the Texas Pecan Shelling Workers Union, UCAPAWA Local 172. Their primary grievances put forth against the Seligmann Company were a 15% pay cut, deploring plant conditions, and unpaid homework.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Joshua.  Shortest Straw: CPUSA in Labor Organizing,  Master's Thesis. Published by CSU Pomona Library, June 2010.  Page 38&lt;/ref&gt; The strike, which also became violent when strikers were teargassed, ended with the recognition of the UCAPAWA local and a minimum wage for workers. Local San Antonio Police responded by attacking Tenyuaca and the UCAPAWA local leadership, arresting them and charging them with "Communist Agitation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Vargas |first =Zaragosa  |title=Labor Rights are Civil Rights. |publisher= Princeton University Press |year= 2005 | location= Princeton | isbn= 0-691-11546-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, UCAPAWA Vice-President [[Dorothy Ray Healey]] played an important role in unionizing workers at [[California Sanitary Canning Company]] (Cal San) in [[Los Angeles]], who struck in August of the same year. Union members picketed the cannery, grocery stores that sold Cal San goods, and the houses of the Shapiro brothers, the plant's owners. Faced with children holding signs bearing slogans such as "I'm underfed because Mama is underpaid," the Shapiro brothers met with negotiators and soon reached a settlement. The Cal San local became UCAPAWA's second largest, and the union's ranks grew to include the workers at several [[California]] canneries.

==Strikes==

One of the early strikes of UCAPAWA was the 1939 Madera Cotton Strike, which, despite provoking a violent reaction from the Associated Farmers, succeeded in winning a minimum wage for union members. It also served as an example of inter-ethnic solidarity, with [[African American]], [[Mexican American]], and [[White American]] workers all participating in the strike.

In [[Seattle, Washington]], UCAPAWA represented [[Filipino people|Filipino]] cannery workers from 1937 to 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Filipino Cannery Unionism Across Three Generations 1930s-1980s| work = Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project| publisher = University of Washington| date = 2006-05-12| url = http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/Cannery_intro.htm| accessdate = 2006-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was a great example of UCAPAWA supporting a minority group that wad usually overlooked by bigger unions.

In Texas, UCAPAWA was instrumental in unionizing and uniting workers from feed, flour, and cotton mills. At a 1938 [[wildcat strike]] of shrimp-processing plant workers, a UCAPAWA organizer was murdered on the picket line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title = Texas State Industrial Union Council| encyclopedia = [[Handbook of Texas]]| publisher = University of Texas| date = May 2005|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/octbg| accessdate = 2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At post-strike meetings, Dorothy Healey outlined election procedures and general union bylaws. The cannery workers who had led the strike were elected to every major post. UCAPAWA organizers Luke Hinman and Ted Rasmussen, who began an organizing drive at the California Walnut Growers' Association plant, replaced Healey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zaragosa|first=Vargas|title=Labor Rights Are Civil Rights: Mexican American Workers in Twentieth-Century America|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|isbn=0-691-11546-X|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demise==

In the [[Southern United States|South]], the [[Southern Tenant Farmers Union]] (STFU), which Communist UCAPAWA President Donald Henderson regarded as "a utopian agrarian movement," became affiliated with the union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title = Southern Tenant Farmers Union| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of the American Left| year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; A power struggle between the groups erupted soon after the affiliation and culminated with a 1939 protest against the eviction of sharecroppers in Missouri, which was not supported by the national organization. As a result, the STFU left the union.
[[Anticommunism]] was not the sole thread in the fabric of responses to UCAPAWA's organization although there were Communists in UCAPAWA. However, UCAPAWA was not a "communist union."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stein|first=Walter J.|title=California and the Dust Bowl Migration|year=1973|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Connecticut|isbn=0-8371-6267-X|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, UCAPAWA became the [[Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers]] (FTA). In 1946, the Los Angeles local "collapsed under the weight of [[Red Scare]] witchhunts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Ruiz |first =Vicki L.  |title=From Out of the Shadows: Mexican Women in Twentieth Century America |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 1998 | location= New York City | isbn= 0-19-513099-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1950, the FTA had only 1,000 workers as members, and it was folded into the [[Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union|Distributive and Processing Workers of America]].

'''Vegetable oil refining''' is a process to transform [[vegetable oil]] into [[biofuel]] by [[hydrocracking]] or [[hydrogenation]].  Hydrocracking breaks big molecules into smaller ones using [[hydrogen]] while hydrogenation adds hydrogen to molecules.  These methods can be used for production of [[gasoline]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]], [[propane]], and other chemical [[feedstock]]. Diesel fuel produced from these sources is known as ''green diesel'' or ''renewable diesel''.

==Feedstock==
The majority of plant and animal oils are [[vegetable oils]] which are [[triglycerides]]—suitable for refining.  Refinery feedstock includes [[canola]], [[algae]], [[jatropha]], [[salicornia oil|salicornia]], [[palm oil]], and [[tallow]]. One type of algae, [[Botryococcus braunii]] produces a different type of oil, known as a [[triterpene]], which is transformed into [[alkanes]] by a different process.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Comparison to biodiesel ==
Based on its feedstock green diesel could be classified as [[biodiesel]]; however, based on the processing technology and chemical formula green diesel and biodiesel are different products.  The chemical reaction commonly used to produce biodiesel is known as [[transesterification]]. Vegetable oil and [[alcohol]] are reacted, producing [[esters]], or biodiesel, and the coproduct, [[glycerol]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

When refining vegetable oil, no glycerol is produced, only fuels.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Commercialization==
Various stages of converting renewable hydrocarbon fuels produced by hydrotreating is done throughout energy industry. Some commercial examples of vegetable oil refining are [[NExBTL]], [[H-Bio]], the ConocoPhilips process, and the [[UOP LLC|UOP]]/[[Eni]] [[Ecofining]] process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.greencarcongress.com/2006/12/conocophillips_.html |title=Green Car Congress: ConocoPhillips Begins Production of Renewable Diesel Fuel at Whitegate Refinery  |work=greencarcongress.com |year=2012 |accessdate=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Petrobras planned to use {{convert|256|Ml|oilbbl}} of vegetable oils in the production of H-Bio fuel in 2007.  ConocoPhilips is processing {{convert|42000|USgal/d|oilbbl/d}} of vegetable oil.Other
companies working on the commercialization and industrialization of renewable hydrocarbons and biofuels include Neste, REG Synthetic Fuels, LLC, ENI, UPM Biofuels, Diamond Green Diesel partnered with countries across the globe.In practice, these renewable diesels lower greenhouse gas emissions by 40-90%,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Products|url = https://www.neste.com/en/companies/products|accessdate = 2015-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; have higher energy per content yields than petroleum-based diesels, and better cold-flow properties to work in colder climates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, all of these green diesels can be introduced into any diesel engine or infrastructure without many mechanical modifications at any ratio with petroleum-based diesels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Renewable diesel from vegetable oil in particular is a growing and profound substitute for petroleum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gladstein.org/gna_whitepapers/renewable-diesel-as-a-major-transportation-fuel-in-california-opportunities-benefits-challenges/|title=Renewable Diesel as a major transportation fuel in California: Opportunities, Benefits, and Challenges|last=|first=|date=August 2017|website=www.Gladstein.org/gna_whitepapers/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  California fleets used over 200,000,000 gallons of renewable diesel in 2017.  [[California Air Resources Board|CARB]] predicts over 2 billion gallons of fuel to be consumed in the state under its [[Low-carbon fuel standard|Low Carbon Fuel Standard]] requirements in the next ten years. Fleets operating on Renewable Diesel from various refiners and feedstocks are reported to see lower emissions, reduced maintenance costs, and nearly identical experience when driving with this fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.staroilco.net/renewable-diesel-as-a-major-transportation-fuel-in-california/|title=Renewable Diesel as a Major Transportation Fuel in California|last=|first=|date=January 20, 2018|website=www.StarOilco.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company history==
WhistleOut was launched in Sydney, Australia in May 2008 with an initial focus of just mobile phone plans. Later the search tool expanded to include comparisons of broadband plans, subscription TV offers and financial services.

Eventually credit card and home loan comparisons were removed, and the company returned its focus to comparison shopping of communication services. The Australia site currently compares over 16,000 plan combinations from 30 suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WhistleOut|url=https://www.whistleout.com.au/|website=WhistleOut|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
