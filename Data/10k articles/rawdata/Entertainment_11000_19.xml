'''Aberrant decoding''' or '''aberrant reading''' is a concept used in fields such as [[communication studies|communication]] and [[media studies]], [[semiotics]], and [[journalism]] about how messages can be interpreted differently from what was intended by their sender. The concept was proposed by [[Umberto Eco]] in an article published first in 1965 in [[Italian language|Italian]] and in 1972 in English.&lt;ref name=Eco1972&gt;{{cite paper|last=Eco|first=Umberto|others=trans. Paola Splendore|journal=Working Papers in Cultural Studies|title=Towards a Semiotic Inquiry Into the Television Message|year=1972|volume=3|pages=103–21|publisher=University of Birmingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Every [[communication]] act requires that the messages must be [[Encode (semiotics)|encoded]] into a set of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] by the sender. These signs must then be transmitted and [[Decode (semiotics)|decoded]] by the receiver to understand the contained messages. The [[Code|code system]] must be shared by both the sender and the receiver in order for the communication to succeed. For example, thoughts must be encoded into words, transmitted through air, and then be decoded back to thoughts. Often the sender has a certain meaning to convey with his message, hoping the receiver will interpret it correctly. This right interpretation can be called the ''preferred decoding'' or ''preferred reading''. When the interpretation of the message is different from what was intended, this can be called ''aberrant decoding''.&lt;ref name=Fiske1990&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=John|title=Introduction to Communication Studies|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415046725|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aberrant decodings can occur in a more widespread range of situations, as wrong interpretation of a media product or text whose incoming message is not the one intended by the creator of the product or text.&lt;ref&gt;Danesi, Marcel (2009), Dictionary of Media and Communications. M.E.Sharpe, Armonk, New York. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Eco, aberrant decodings were rare in [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial societies]], when most communication occurred between people who shared the same [[culture]]. He lists four classes of exceptions where aberrant decodings could have happened:&lt;ref name=Hartley2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Hartley|first=John|title=Communication, Cultural and Media Studies: The key concepts|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415268899|edition=3rd|author2=Rennie, Elinor|author3= Brennan, Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*People who did not share the same language.
*People trying to interpret the meanings of past cultures. For example, [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] people looking at [[Roman art]].
*People who did not share the same [[belief system]]. For example, [[Christian]]s looking at [[Paganism|pagan]] art.
*People who came from different cultures. For example, white [[Europeans]] looking at [[Aboriginal art]].

Eco continues that in contemporary media, instead of being exceptions, aberrant decodings have become the norm. For example, TV broadcasters know beforehand that their messages will be interpreted in various ways. He speculated that because of this freedom of interpretation, the power of media over individuals might be much less influential than is thought.&lt;ref name="Hartley2002" /&gt;

This idea of examining the messages contained in the media and how the audience interprets them has since become one of the core concepts of academic media research. Eco's article influenced, among others, [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]'s [[Hall's Theory|encoding/decoding theory]].&lt;ref name="Hartley2002" /&gt;

[[John Fiske (media scholar)|John Fiske]] has argued that aberrant decoding occurs mainly with [[Iconography|iconic codes]], referring to visual messages.&lt;ref name="Fiske1990" /&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;''Iconic codes'' or ''iconic signs'' in semiotics and communication theory could also refer to a [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs|class of signs]] defined by [[iconicity]] (as in [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]]'s triadic sign theory). But in this case Fiske contrasts iconic signs with "verbal language" (p. 78).&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, he explains how prehistoric cave paintings of animals are often seen as graceful and moving. However, in 1960 [[M. L. J. Abercrombie|Margaret Abercrombie]]&lt;ref name=Abercrombie1960&gt;{{cite book|last=Abercrombie|first=Margaret|title=The Anatomy of Judgement: An Investigation into the Processes of Perception and Reasoning|year=1960|publisher=Hutchinson|location=London|isbn=978-1299246812}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that the paintings are, in fact, depictions of dead animals. Thus if we accept Abercrombie's claim, we can argue that our modern culture, where we value living animals and only rarely encounter dead ones, has led us to aberrant decoding of the paintings.

{{For|the backgammon variant|Acey-deucey}}

'''Acey Deucey''', also known as '''In-Between''', '''Sheets''' or '''Maverick''', is a simple [[card game]] that involves betting.

==Rules==
Before the action, each player must add their [[Betting in poker#Ante|ante]] into the pot.  Two cards are then dealt face-up to one player.  That player then bets from nothing to the amount that is in the pot at the time whether or not the third card will numerically fall in between the first two.  If the third card falls in between the two other cards, the bettor takes the amount he bet out of the pot; if the third card falls outside of the two other cards, the bettor must add what he bet to the pot; and if the third card matches the numerical value of one of the other two cards, the bettor must add to the pot double what they bet.  If two cards of the same value come up, e.g. 2,2 the bettor picks if the next card will be higher or lower and bets.  If the next card is the same as the last two, i.e. a 2, the bettor must triple their bet. 

===Regionally specific rules===
The rules and specifics of the game often vary from region to region. For example in [[Liaoning province]], northeast China the minimum number of players is 4 and each player is required to ante before the first card is turned.  Two cards are then dealt face-up to one player.  That player then bets from nothing to the amount that is in the pot at the time (during the first time around the table players are only allowed to bet up to half of the pot) whether or not the third card will numerically fall in between the first two. Other regions, such as in the United States, play the game by combining two decks of cards. This adds another dynamic to the game due to the extra number of similar type cards. Beyond that, most of the other rules followed by United States players are similar to those which are observed in the Liaoning province.

Just about all regions play if the third card falls in between the two other cards, the bettor takes the amount he bet out of the pot; if the third card falls outside of the two other cards, the bettor must add what he bet to the pot; and if the third card matches the numerical value of one of the other two cards, this is referred to as a "Post" and the bettor must add to the pot double his initial bet. If two cards of the same value come up, e.g. 2,2 the bettor picks if the next card will be higher or lower and bets.  If the next card is the same as the last two, i.e. a 2, this is considered a "Post" and the player is required to pay triple the bet for the hand.

===Aces===
In addition to this, there is a special rule for [[Ace (card)|Aces]]. If the first card turned is an Ace the player may choose its value as either the high Ace or the low one. Low Ace is always lower than any other card, including the deuce. If an Ace comes up as the second card turned it is always considered the high Ace. If a player "Posts" on an Ace they are required to pay four times their bet for that hand. Aces also cause an automatic loss if it is the third card turned when the first two cards are a match, e.g. 6,6. The best spread in the game is considered to be a low Ace on the left and a high Ace on the right. This is also one of the worst [[Hand (card games)|hands]] to get as you run the risk of the third card being an Ace and having to pay four times your bet for the hand.

==Strategy==

Players attempting to middle two posts with a spread of less than 8 will show a long term loss. (Where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the spread between the posts (i.e., the value of the higher card minus the value of the lower card), &lt;math&gt;4 (n - 1)=4(11-(n-1))+2 \times 2 \times 3 &lt;/math&gt; solves to a break-even point of 8.0.)

==Variations==

A variation is to split the cards if two end cards are the same value. This requires the bettor to ante in for two hands and the dealer would draw one more card under each of the end cards. After this, the same rules apply.

Some new rules that increase payouts and betting:
*Blind Pot - Bet the pot before your 2 outside cards are placed.  In the case of a win, you win the pot.  If you are outside of your cards you lose half the pot.  If you post you have to pay the full amount of the pot.
*"AutoPot" - Any A-2 played as your outside cards automatically make the player bet the full amount of the pot.
*Post Bet - You can bet that your inside card will match one of your outside cards.  In the case of this you win the full pot and in addition each player pays an equal percentage to match the pot.  Therefore, the player that post would win 2x the pot.  If the player bets the post and misses he owes half the amount of the pot to the pot.
*Satan 6s - Any player that gets 6-6-6 as their cards must pay 6x the amount of the pot to the pot.

==In popular culture==
The game show ''[[Card Sharks]]'' is based on Acey Deucey and closely resembles the rules. In this game, two players answer high-low survey questions, and guess whether the next card is higher or lower (with duplicates counting as wrong).

Acey-ducey is often mentioned in the book series [[The Corps Series|The Corps]] by [[W.E.B. Griffin]] which is set in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]], and follows the lives of a group of [[United States Marine Corps|marines]] in special service. Griffin never explains the game in the slightest, but his characters are often playing it when they are interrupted by the war, i.e. required to stop playing to perform some duty.

In 1978 a [[type-in program]] [[BASIC]] [[video game]] version was distributed via the book [[BASIC Computer Games]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atariarchives.org/basicgames/showpage.php?page=2 Acey Ducy] in [[BASIC Computer Games]], 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

An unsold 1985 game show pilot hosted by [[Jim McKrell]], entitled ''Split Decision,'' had contestants playing the game Acey Deucey while answering general knowledge questions.  Each player picked a card to share and had their own base card, and tried to fit a card in or bust the other player.

{{distinguish|Afternoon Play}}

'''''Afternoon''''' is a [[feminist]] play written in 1883 by [[Ouida]]. It features a man, Earl L'Estrange, who marries a peasant girl, Claire Glyon. L'Estrange grows disillusioned with her and it seems she drowned herself. However, twenty years later he falls in love with a reclusive artist famous for her work, which turns out to be Claire herself, who has not drowned at all. For the remainder of the play, Claire and her friend Laura mock L'Estranger with biting wit, and he in turn eventually concedes that he had not valued his wife as he should have.

'''Alvin Tan''' is the founder and artistic director of [[The Necessary Stage]] (TNS), and the co-artistic director of the [[M1 Singapore Fringe Festival]]. Under Tan's leadership, TNS has grown from a small society in 1987 to one of Singapore’s most prominent and respected theatre companies. He also initiated the Company's Theatre For Youth Branch and the Marine Parade Theatre Festival. 

He has a Bachelor of Arts from the [[National University of Singapore]], a Diploma in Education from [[UCL Institute of Education|the Institute of Education]], and a Master of Arts from the [[University of Birmingham]].

==Career==
One of the leading proponents of devising theatre in Singapore, Tan has directed more than 40 plays, which have been staged in Singapore, Malaysia, Glasgow, Cairo, Busan, Seoul, Melbourne, Birmingham, London, Dublin, Cairo, New Delhi, Hungary and Romania. Some of these landmark productions include ''Lanterns Never Go Out'', ''Still Building'', ''Pillars'', ''Galileo'', ''Koan'' and ''godeatgod''. He was also involved in ''Diaspora'' in Scotland, for which he co-directed goteatgod with [[7:84 Theatre Company|7:84]], a Scottish theatre company.

In 1997, Tan was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship. The following year, he was conferred the Young Artist Award by the [[National Arts Council (Singapore)|National Arts Council]]. Tan is also strongly involved in civil society work, representing Singapore in numerous conferences and workshops around the world. Tan was invited to participate in the World Culture Forum Alliance in São Paulo and the Conference of Asian Foundations and Organisations in Barcelona, as well as 2005's World Culture Forum in Jordan.

In December 2005, Tan directed ''Boxing Day: The Tsunami Project'', a response to the tragedy of 2004, as well as ''Separation 40'' with [[Kuala Lumpur]] theatre group Dramalab's Zahim Albakri, which won three 2005 BOH Cameronian Arts Awards including Best Director. He  co-directed a collaborative project entitled ''Mobile'', a commission of the Singapore Arts Festival 2006 with artists from Japan, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand that had its world premiere in Singapore in June 2006. ''Mobile'' toured to Kuala Lumpur for a three-night run at The Actors Studio in Bangsar, and Japan for several performances in March 2007.

In September 2006, Tan directed a main season production for The Necessary Stage, ''Fundamentally Happy'' held at The Necessary Stage Black Box. The play toured to Malaysia for stagings at The Actors Studio in January 2007, before being reprised as part of the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival 2007 at the [[National Museum of Singapore|National Museum Gallery Theatre]]. The play was adapted into a film in 2015 by directors Tan Bee Thiam and Lei Yuan Bin, starring [[Adibah Noor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loh|first1=Genevieve Sarah|title=Singapore directors to appeal Malaysian ban of their film Fundamentally Happy|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-directors-to-appeal-malaysian-ban-of-their-film/3224944.html|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=21 October 2016|date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Animated films]] in the United States date back to at least 1906 when [[Vitagraph]] released ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]''.&lt;ref name="CartoonEncyclopedia"&gt;Jeff Lenburg 1991 The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons {{ISBN|0-8160-2252-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although early animations were rudimentary they rapidly became more sophisticated with such classics as ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' in 1914, [[Felix the Cat]], and [[Koko the Clown]].

Originally a novelty, some early animated silents depicted [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] acts or were strongly influenced by the [[comic strip]]. Later, they were distributed along with [[newsreel]]s. Early animation films, like their live-action silent cousins, would come with a [[Film score|musical score]] to be played by an [[organist]] or even an [[orchestra]] in larger theatres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==History==
The art of animation can be traced back to prehistoric and ancient times when people drew multiple pictures on walls and clay pots to try and capture the illusion of life. This eventually led to the invention of the [[Zoetrope]] in 1834. However it was not until the advent of [[film]] did animation start to take off. There is no single creator of film animation, since many people were working on several similar projects around the same time.

[[Georges Méliès]]; creator of [[special effect]] in motion pictures, was one of the first people to use animation with his technique. Méliès discovered a technique when his camera accidentally  broke down while shooting a bus driving by. When he had fixed the camera, a hearse happened to be passing by just as Méliès restarted rolling the film, his end result was that he had managed to make a bus transform into a hearse, which is a camera effect called a [[stop trick]]. He had discovered that by shooting one frame at a time and changing the image in between frames he could create the illusion of movement, thus [[stop-motion animation]].

[[J. Stuart Blackton]] was possibly the first American film-maker to use techniques animation. Several of his films, among them ''[[The Enchanted Drawing]]'' (1900) and ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (1906) were film versions of Blackton's "lightning artist" routine, and utilized modified versions of Méliès' early stop-motion animation techniques to make a series of [[blackboard]] drawings appear to move and reshape themselves. 'Humorous Phases of Funny Faces' is regularly cited as the first true animated film, and Blackton is considered the first true [[animator]].

[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|200px|''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908) by [[Émile Cohl]]]]
Another French artist, [[Émile Cohl]], created a film in 1908 called ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]''. The film largely consisted of a [[stick figure]] moving about and encountering all manner of morphing objects, such as a wine bottle that transforms into a flower. There were also sections of live action where the animator's hands would enter the scene. The film was created by drawing each frame on paper and then shooting each frame onto [[negative film]], which gave the picture a blackboard look. This makes ''Fantasmagorie'' the first animated film created using what came to be known as [[traditional animation|hand-drawn animation]].

[[Image:Gertie the Dinosaur.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=6:58|left|''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' by Winsor McCay, 1914]]

Following the successes of Blackton and Cohl, many other artists began experimenting with animation. One such artist was [[Winsor McCay]], who created detailed animation with painstaking attention to detail. Each frame was drawn on paper; which invariably required backgrounds and characters to be redrawn and animated. Among McCay's most noted films are ''[[Little Nemo (1911 film)|Little Nemo]]'' (1911), ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' (1914) and ''[[The Sinking of the Lusitania]]'' (1918).

The production of animated short films, typically referred to as "cartoons", became an industry of its own during the 1910s, and cartoon shorts were produced to be shown in [[movie theaters]]. The most successful early animation producer was [[John Randolph Bray]], who, along with [[animator]] [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[cel animation]] process which dominated the animation industry for the rest of the decade.

The most popular cartoon series during the silent era was [[Pat Sullivan (film producer)|Pat Sullivan]]'s [[Felix the Cat]]. ''Felix the Cat'' was first created in 1919 with [[Feline Follies]] and became hugely successful throughout the 1920s. However the studio came into trouble during the advent of sound cartoons in the early 1930s when the popularity of Walt Disney's Mickey Mouse was rising above Sullivan's Felix. Sullivan tried to adapt Felix by creating Felix sound cartoons, but they failed to please audiences and Sullivan closed the studio in 1930. He died three years later due to health problems related to [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite news |last=Gordon |first=Ian |title=Felix the Cat |work=St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100434 |accessdate=2009-06-24 | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''Australian pub''' or '''hotel''' is a '''[[public house]]''' or '''pub''' for short, in Australia, and is an establishment licensed to serve [[alcoholic beverage|alcoholic drinks]] for consumption on the premises. They also provide other services, as entertainment venues, serving meals and providing basic accommodation.

== History ==

=== Origin ===
The Australian pub is a direct descendant of the British and Irish [[public house|pub]]. The production and consumption of alcoholic drinks has long played a key role in Western commerce and social activity, and this is reflected in the importance of pubs in the [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|British colonisation of Australia]] after 1788. However, in the 19th century the local version evolved a number of distinctive features that set it apart from the classic British or urban Irish pub.

In many cases, pubs were the first structures built in newly colonised areas, especially on the [[gold mining|goldfields]], and new towns often grew up around them. Pubs typically served multiple functions, simultaneously serving as hostelry, post office, restaurant, meeting place and sometimes even [[general store]].

==== Nineteenth-century development ====

Pubs proliferated during the 19th century, especially during the [[gold rush]] that began in the 1850s, and many fine examples were built in the state capitals and major regional cities and towns. Some of the best colonial-era pubs in Australia's major cities have fallen victim to urban re-development, which has destroyed a significant portion of Australia's 19th-century architectural heritage. State capitals like [[Melbourne]] and [[Adelaide]], and large regional cities and towns such as [[Kalgoorlie]] in Western Australia still boast some examples, and many other 19th century pubs survive in country towns.

Among the colonial-era hotels, now lost to development, were the [[Bellevue Hotel, Brisbane|Bellevue Hotel]] in [[Brisbane]] (demolished in 1979)&lt;ref name="bellevue demolition"&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Hurst |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/bellevue-hotel-was-cheaper-to-knock-down-20091231-lkui.html |title=News article detailing Bellevue Hotel demolition timeline |work=Brisbane Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; and two of Sydney's pub-hotels – the Hotel Australia, which formerly stood on the corner of Castlereagh St and Martin Place (demolished c. 1970 to make way for the [[MLC Centre]]) and the Tattersall's Hotel in Pitt St. Its marble bar was dismantled and reinstalled in a basement under the Sydney Hilton Hotel, which was built on the site of the Tattersall's Hotel in the early 1970s.

The development that solidified the characteristic style of the modern Australian pub was the introduction of the American-style bar counter in the early nineteenth{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} century. Customers began to sit apart from the publicans, the atmosphere became commercial rather than home-like and the pub became a distinctly public, Australian [[Patriarchy|male-dominated]] establishment.

== Beer drinking culture in Australia ==
Australia's beer-drinking culture is descended from the northern European tradition, which favoured grain-derived beverages like beer and spirits, whereas in southern European countries like Italy and [[Greece]] wine was the drink of choice. Beer was for many years the largest-selling form of alcoholic drink in Australia, and Australia has long had one of the highest per capita rates of beer consumption in the world.

Australia did not develop a significant wine-making industry until the 20th century and while the wine industry grew steadily, wine did not become a major consumer drink until the late 20th century. Therefore, for the period between 1800 and 1950, alcohol production and consumption in Australia was dominated by beer and spirits, with Australian pubs becoming synonymous with ice-cold pilsener beer.

== Effect of licensing laws ==
Liquor licensing policies in early colonial Australia were relatively liberal, but in the late 19th century there was growing pressure from conservative Christian groups, known as the [[Temperance movement|Temperance]] Leagues, to restrict the sale of alcohol. In [[Liverpool riot of 1916|1916 after drunken soldiers rioted]] in Sydney new licensing laws restricted alcohol in all Australian states, in most cases banning sales after 6 pm. The new legislation also forced publicans seeking a spirits licence to also obtain a beer licence and to provide accommodation.

The licensing laws restricted the sale and service of alcohol almost exclusively to pubs for decades. Alcohol could usually  be purchased only in pubs, and many states placed restrictions on the number of bottles per customer that could be sold over the counter. It was not until the late 20th century that "bottle-shops" and chain-store outlets (where liquor was sold but not served) became common and restaurants and cafes were more widely licensed to serve liquor or to allow customers to "bring their own".

Opening hours were generally heavily restricted, and pubs were usually open only from 10 am to 6 pm, Monday to Saturday. Some pubs were granted special licences to open and close earlier – e.g. opening at 6 am and closing at 3 pm – in areas where there were large numbers of people working night shifts. Pubs were invariably closed on Sundays, until the various state Sunday Observance Acts were repealed during the 1950s and early 1960s.

These restrictions created a small but lucrative black market in illegal alcohol, leading to the proliferation of illegal alcohol outlets in many urban areas; the so-called "sly grog shop". After the [[Federation of Australia]] in 1901, Australia's new constitution ruled that the [[Commonwealth of Australia]] had no power to legislate in this area, so each state enacted and enforced its own liquor licensing regulations. This meant the [[Prohibition]] lobby in Australia had to lobby each individual state government, and was unable to achieve any nationwide ban on the sale of alcohol. Although liquor sales remained heavily restricted for many years, Australia did not experience the many social ills, including the vast expansion of [[organised crime]] that resulted from Prohibition in the United States in the 1920s.

Perhaps because of the generally hot, dry climate, Australian beer drinkers soon came to favour chilled [[pilsener]] style beers. This trend was reinforced with the expansion and consolidation of the Australian brewing industry, and by the development of hop growing, especially in [[Tasmania]].

The dominance of chilled pilsener beer was further reinforced by the [[List of Australian inventions#Colonial era – 19th century|invention of refrigeration]]. Australia was one of the first countries to adopt the new technology on a wide scale and pubs were among the first local businesses to use refrigeration, to keep beer ice-cold.

Another notable feature of Australian beer is its relatively high alcohol content, which for many years has typically ranged between 4 percent and 6 percent alcohol – somewhat higher than their British and American counterparts.

Beer production in Australia began with small private breweries supplying local pubs. The industry rapidly became both larger in scale and more centralised as brewers adopted [[mass-production]] techniques during the late 19th century and new modes of transport came into operation.

By the 20th century the major brewing firms had become very large [[vertical integration|vertically integrated]] businesses. They owned the breweries and ran truck fleets and distribution networks, and the major brewers owned chains of pubs across the country. The premises were typically operated on a [[leasehold]] basis by licensed publicans.

As they grew, the larger and more successful firms began to take over smaller breweries, although they often retained the older brand names and the loyal clientele of those brands, such as [[Carlton &amp; United Breweries]] (CUB) continuing to distribute "Tooth's [[KB Lager]]" and "[[Resch's]] Pilsener" and "DA" ("Dinner Ale") after they had bought and eventually closed the Reschs and Tooths breweries. By the mid-20th century the brewing industry was dominated by a handful of large and powerful state-based companies: Tooth's and Toohey's in Sydney, Carlton United in Melbourne, Castlemaine in Brisbane, West End and Coopers in Adelaide and Swan in Perth.  These brands effectively became unofficial mascots for their respective states. In Victoria, until the late 1990s, a distinction was largely observed of serving the similar CUB lagers Carlton Draught on tap and Victoria Bitter and, to a lesser extent, Melbourne Bitter in bottles and cans; as Victoria Bitter became a prominent national brand on tap, in turn it became considerably more common on tap in Victoria.

In the late 20th century these beer empires began to expand overseas, before being themselves merged into consolidated global producers; brands under the Australasian CUB and Lion-Nathan subsidiaries of major global beverage empires have considerable presence in Australasia, the UK, Europe and many other regions.

== Pubs and licensing laws ==
Each Australian state has its own set of liquor licensing laws which regulate the times that pubs could open and close. Until recently these laws were relatively strict, a legacy of the influence of the 'reformist' Christian Temperance groups in the late 19th and early 20th century.

=== The temperance movement ===
The concerns of these groups were in some areas well-founded. Alcohol abuse was an endemic social problem in most western countries and, as the local brewing and distilling industry expanded, it quickly became a serious problem in Australia. However, the Temperance movements were driven by a dogmatic Christian world view, and the aim of the larger "Christian Morality" movement at this time was to outlaw any social behaviour which went against Christian teaching – this included the consumption of alcohol, all forms of gambling and animal racing, prostitution and recreational (non-alcohol) drug use.

Temperance advocates feared – with some justification – that workers would spend all their time and money in the pub if they were permitted to stay there throughout the evening, and that children and families would suffer as a result (which they often did). Pubs were seen as a nexus for all kinds of immoral activity, including illegal "[[SP betting]]", and the Temperance movement lobbied long and hard to have public houses tightly regulated and their opening hours severely restricted.

In this area, the "[[wowser]]s" (as they were dubbed) were very successful but these high moral concerns backfired, at least in terms of liquor licensing, and the new laws led to the evolution of what was a new phenomenon in Australian 20th century pub culture.

=== The six o'clock swill ===
From the advent of the [[eight-hour day]] until the late 1970s, most Australian blue-collar workers were tied to a 9am-5pm, Monday-to-Friday work schedule. Because most pubs were only permitted to stay open until 6 pm, workers would commonly head for the nearest pub as soon as they finished work at 5 pm, where they would drink as much as possible, as quickly as possible, in the hour before the pub closed. This practice came to be known as the "[[six o'clock swill]]".

It fostered an endemic culture of daily [[binge drinking]], which in turn created persistent problems of alcohol-related violence – drunken patrons regularly got into alcohol-fuelled fights in and around the pub, and many husbands arrived home in the early evening extremely drunk, with negative consequences. This destructive 'tradition' persisted through most of the 20th century but it quickly disappeared after the 1960s, when changes to the licensing laws in most states allowed pubs to stay open until 10 pm.

Another factor that reinforced the nexus between pubs and problem drinking was the fact that, until the late 20th century in most parts of Australia, alcohol could usually only be purchased over the counter at the pub, and the types and amount of alcohol that could be sold was also restricted.

=== The bottle shop ===
The pub-based "bottle shop", usually one of the smaller bars converted into a sales area for bottled and canned drinks, is now commonplace in Australian pubs, but these only began to appear in the 1960s. These were followed by specialist "sales-only" retail outlet chains where alcohol is not served on the premises. It is still unusual for alcohol to be sold in retail grocery stores in Australia, and specialist liquor stores account for most of the alcohol sold in Australia. In most large cities and towns there were also a number of designated "early openers", pubs that were specially licensed to open in the early morning and close mid-afternoon. These early openers primarily catered for shift workers who had just finished a 9pm-6am night shift.

=== The pub crawl ===
Another Australian pub tradition, which some considered almost as undesirable as the six o'clock swill, was the [[pub crawl]]. In many inner city and suburban areas, it was common to find numerous pubs located within a short distance of each other. It became a regular tradition, especially on weekends and public holidays, for groups of drinkers to undertake marathon drinking sessions that moved from pub to pub. Pub crawls would begin in the late afternoon or early evening, then progress to each of the neighbouring pubs in turn. Although it still continues in some areas, the worst excesses of the pub crawl tradition have largely disappeared thanks to the enforcement of [[Alcohol server training|responsible service of alcohol (RSA)]] laws. These laws have made it illegal to serve drunk patrons and both premises and server are liable to severe fines for supplying alcohol to people who are intoxicated.

=== Violence and crime ===
These regulations and conventions created a climate in which many pubs – especially those located near dockyards and other industrial sites – gained a reputation for being violent, dangerous and generally unsavoury places. Australians were among the highest per capita alcohol consumers in the world, and the combination of large amounts of alcohol, an all-male clientele and aggravating factors like the six o'clock swill regularly led to violent clashes between inebriated patrons.

The relationship between pubs and crime in Australia was established early, and some inner-city and suburban pubs were frequented by criminals, who met there to recruit accomplices and plan "jobs". Criminals also regularly used particular pubs as "shop fronts" from which to sell the proceeds of their crimes on the black market. Late in the 20th century, this dubious tradition came to include drug dealing, and every major Australian city has pubs which became notorious from the 1970s as virtual "supermarkets" for cannabis, amphetamines, heroin and other drugs.

=== Gambling ===
Gaming and betting is another major part of Australian pub culture. Legal gambling is a relatively new phenomenon in Australia, but illegal gaming has always been part of pub culture. Because legal betting on horse and dog races was for many years restricted to racetracks, and no off-track betting was permitted, illegal betting (usually known as "starting price" or [[SP bookmaking]]) proliferated. Pubs became a major venue for the collection of bets and the distribution of winnings. One Australian author has noted that SP bookmaking had become so widespread by the early 20th century that constituted "a virtual national act of civil disobedience".

One of the betting games most closely associated with the Aussie pub was the coin game [[two-up]], which was extremely popular during the 19th and earlier 20th century. It is most often associated with the celebration of [[Anzac Day]] on 25 April each year. In the years after World War I, it became traditional that, after the early morning commemorative service and march, ex-servicemen would gather at local pubs to drink, reminisce and play two-up. Although still technically illegal, Anzac Day two-up games are now openly played in streets and laneways outside pubs and it has become a national institution that is now generally ignored by police.

Slot machines, known locally as "[[Slot machine#Australia|pokies]]", remain an important source of custom and revenue, although restrictive state-level licensing means that only a minority of pubs can operate them.  In 2002, over half of the $4 billion in gambling revenue collected by state governments came from pubs and clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/ageing/technicalpapers/paper_10/technicalpaper10.pdf|title=Productivity Commission, Economic Implications of an Ageing Australia, 12 April 2005, Technical Paper No.10, "Gambling revenue"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Live music and the pub circuit ==
{{Main|Pub rock (Australia)}}

In the 1970s and 1980s, pubs played an important role as venues for live rock music in Australia.

Reflecting the age of its fans, in the preceding decades, pop and rock music performances were typically "all ages" events. Smaller concerts were often held in public venues like community, church, school or local council halls, and larger performances (like tours by visiting international acts) were staged in major concert halls or sports stadiums. Some concerts were staged in licensed premises, but the vast majority were in public venues open to all ages, and alcohol was unavailable.

By the late 1960s, Australia's "baby boomer" pop audience was ageing into its late teens and early twenties. This demographic trend coincided with the gradual relaxation of states'  restrictive licensing laws – the legal drinking age was generally lowered to 18 (in line with changes to the voting age) and the opening hours of pubs were finally allowed to be extended to 10pm.

Rock concerts were attracting younger audiences in large numbers, and changes in the licensing laws enabled pubs to begin presenting regular concerts by rock groups in the early 1970s. Such "pub gigs" were often presented free-of-charge, with the cost recouped from alcohol sales, although it became more common for licensees and/or promoters to charge an entry fee, especially for the more popular groups whose fees were higher.

=== Low cost venues ===
The relatively low cost of staging pub gigs, the large numbers of patrons they attracted and the high volume of alcohol sales that resulted made them very attractive to pub licensees. State capitals like Melbourne and Sydney had dozens of pubs in inner-city and suburban areas, and many of these had large function rooms or large public bars from the early 1970s pubs became one of the most important outlets for Australian rock music. Many significant Australian groups of the 1970s and 1980s – including [[AC/DC]], [[Cold Chisel]], [[Midnight Oil]], [[The Choirboys (band)|The Choirboys]] and [[INXS]] – spent their formative years playing on the pub circuit.

Another significant feature of the pub gig was that it gave rock groups in the so-called "Second Wave" of Australian rock the chance to develop their performance and repertoire. Pubs like the renowned [[Station Hotel]] in [[Prahran]], Melbourne, offered extended residencies to popular or up-and-coming rock bands, enabling them to hone their playing 'chops' and refine their material in front of a varied audience, and many groups generated fiercely loyal local followings thanks to pub residencies.

The live proficiency of Australian 'pub-rock' bands of this period is widely attributed to their experiences playing in the rough-and-ready atmosphere of the pub circuit. Unlike the frenzied but generally upbeat atmosphere typical of Sixties pop shows, pub gigs could be a testing experience for even the most accomplished band. Often as not, a significant proportion of the audience were in varying states of intoxication, and groups who did not provide the kind of performance that was required by the audience would be mercilessly heckled by dissatisfied crowds.

=== Regular venues ===
By the late 1970s a significant number of capital-city and regional pubs were presenting rock music on a regular basis, forming a loose but lucrative circuit of venues for bands all over Australia, and the most popular venues offered music every night of the week.

Certain groups became closely associated with formative residencies at particular pubs – a prime example was the long-running residency by Midnight Oil at the Royal Antler Hotel in [[Narrabeen]], on Sydney's northern beaches in the late 1970s.

Some pubs became associated with particular styles – in the early 1980s, the Civic Hotel in Sydney's CBD provided important support for many emerging local "[[New wave music|new wave]]" acts including [[Mental As Anything]], [[The Choirboys (band)|The Choirboys]], The Numbers, [[Sunnyboys]], INXS and [[Matt Finish]].
Other pub-rock venues became renowned for offering a wide variety of music by the best established and emerging acts; venues of this period include the General Bourke Hotel in Adelaide, the Railway Hotel in Richmond, Victoria, and in Sydney, the  Annandale Hotel, the Family Inn in [[Rydalmere]], the Hopetoun Hotel in [[Surry Hills]] and the [[Sandringham Hotel, Newtown|Sandringham Hotel]] in [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]].

By the end of the 1970s the pub circuit was a major provider of rock music entertainment in Australia and as a result, early tours by many visiting overseas acts from overseas who were becoming popular in Australia included many performances at major city and regional pubs; this included the first Australian tours by bands like [[XTC]], [[The Cure]] and [[Simple Minds]]; such bands were often "broken" locally thanks to airplay on the ABC's new non-commercial 24-hour rock radio station [[Triple J]], which played a wide variety of new music not heard on commercial pop-rock stations, and many international rock acts of the 1980s gained live exposure on the Australian pub circuit before gaining wider acceptance.

Pub rock flourished in the 1980s, and this period is now regarded with a degree of nostalgia, and it has come to be considered something of a "golden age" for Australian post-punk rock music. A number of social and economic trends combined to reduce the flourishing pub-rock circuit to a shadow of its former self.

In the late 1980s Australian state governments began relaxing the laws governing legalised gambling. One of the most significant changes was the controversial decision to allow the placement of [[poker machine]]s in pubs. Poker machines quickly delivered huge financial returns to pub licensees and it soon became much easier and more profitable for licensees to close the rooms formerly used for music shows and refurbish them as poker machine parlours.

=== The effects of real estate development ===
Another related trend that severely affected the pub circuit was the property boom in Australian capital cities in the 1980s. In cities like Sydney, which once boasted dozens of pubs in the central business district alone, rising prices and increased demand for CBD and inner-city properties saw many pubs closed and demolished. Their strategic location made them prime targets for redevelopment, as did the fact that these buildings – which were often only two or three stories high – were relatively easy and cheap to buy up and redevelop.

The interlinked process of urban redevelopment and [[gentrification]] also had a major effect on pubs that acted as rock music venues. From the 1970s on, Australian capital-city CBDs began to be redeveloped; many buildings that were once occupied by businesses or offices that operated on a 9-to-5 basis moved to cheaper locations and in the 1990s a significant number of formerly commercial buildings were either demolished to make way for apartment complexes, or were redeveloped for housing.

=== Gentrification ===
Another trend that had a significant impact on the pub circuit was the process of gentrification in inner-city suburbs in Australian cities. For much of the 20th century, suburbs like Port Melbourne and Newtown (Sydney) were working class, low-income areas with a high proportion of migrants, sometimes regarded as slums. However, in the last quarter of the 20th century, suburbs like [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]] and Newtown attracted many younger people because of their colourful character, the availability of cheap rental housing and their proximity to the city and major tertiary institutions like [[The University of Sydney]]. Many former students eventually settled in the area and bought property there, and these former "slums" soon became some sought-after locales, beginning a process of gentrification that saw many pub venues put under increasing pressure to modify their trading hours and limit the amount of noise that emanated from pub gigs, which was often considerable.

These significant changes to social demographies led to many renowned pub venues such as the Hopetoun Hotel in Surry Hills ceasing their presentation of music and other events. The inherent value of the property occupied by pubs also led to many more being demolished or developed.

One notable casualty of this trend in Sydney was the former [[Harold Park Hotel]] in Glebe. This once thriving pub venue was a popular music venue from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s, and during its heyday in the 1980s, as well as regular rock gigs, it presented a variety of other events including:

* "Writers in the Park", a weekly performance forum for authors, which featured an appearance by renowned author [[Tom Wolfe]]
* "Comics in the Park", which presented some of the best Australian and overseas comedians, including a legendary impromptu stand-up performance by American comedian [[Robin Williams]]
* the weekly political discussion forum "Politics in the Park"

The typical Aussie pub differs markedly from the cosy, welcoming, family-friendly "cottage" atmosphere of British pubs, albeit with some exceptions. Rapid urban development, coupled with a widespread disregard for Australia's colonial architectural history, has played a large part in this. Most older English pubs have been declared protected heritage sites, since many are now centuries old, but this curatorial attitude is yet to achieve widespread acceptance in Australia, and few pubs in Australia date back further than the second half of the 19th century and some of the grandest Victorian-era pubs have also been destroyed.

Surviving late 19th-century pubs such as the [[Old Canberra Inn]] in [[Lyneham, Australian Capital Territory]] are similar to their British antecedents in layout and atmosphere, although many Australian pubs of this era are typically a good deal larger than the average British pub; many are three stories high or more, and they usually include several very spacious bar areas, as well as large accommodation spaces on the upper floors.

Major regional and country pubs dating from the 19th century and early 20th century are often large and imposing structures, and many were lavishly decorated, both inside and out. Because of Australia's high summer temperatures, wide awnings and verandahs were common around pub exteriors, as they were for most colonial-era commercial buildings. Pub verandahs and balconies were often fitted with elaborate [[iron lace]] facings and cast-iron columns, because these new mass-produced components were highly fashionable, relatively cheap, and easily transportable. Sometimes, in areas where wood was plentiful, internal decoration included elaborately carved wooden fretwork panels.

=== In the nineteenth century ===
19th century pub interiors often featured very high ceilings – typically four metres (12&amp;nbsp;feet) or more. Ceilings and upper walls were often embellished with elaborate plaster panels and cornices. Mass-produced embossed tin panelling was widely used when it became available in the late 19th century. Windows were often glazed with decorative [[leadlight]] or etched/sandblasted glass panes.

The main bars in the biggest pubs typically featured large and very impressive serving bars, featuring intricately carved and finished wood and/or stone features, with brass rails, ceramic or brass pump handles, tiles, mirrors, etched glass panels and many other types of decoration.

By far the most opulent extant example of the 19th-century Australian pub bar is the famed Marble Bar, originally built in the former Tattersall's Hotel in Sydney. Even relatively modest pubs often featured impressive bars carved from native [[Toona ciliata|Australian red cedar]] (which was then in plentiful supply) and other native woods, and often embellished with decorative ceramic tiles and marble and/or brass fittings.

=== In the twentieth century ===
Following the consolidation of the brewery industry in the 20th century, many new pubs were built and in large cities many older pubs were either extensively renovated or demolished and replaced with new structures.

Although Australian pubs vary considerably in size and design, it is possible to define a number of distinctive features that describe the 'classic' Australian urban pub of the mid-20th century. The typical Aussie pub was functionally designed, often in a stripped-back [[Art Deco]] or [[International style (architecture)|International Style]]. Usually two or three-storey structures, they are typically built of brick and/or concrete, making extensive use of prefabricated plaster sheeting and cornices, ceramic tiles and [[terrazzo]] in their internal linings.

In layout, urban pubs typically feature several inter-connected bar-rooms of different sizes and designations, usually clustered around a large central bar area with several serving outlets. Many suburban pubs also often include an outdoor or semi-enclosed area known as a "[[beer garden]]", where food and drink was served and where (especially in recent years) families with children are able to eat (although children of course cannot be served alcohol and they are not permitted in any other area of the pub).

Larger pubs – especially regional cities and large towns – often included a substantial kitchen and dining room and/or a function room of some kind, such as a ballroom, although this was not common in later urban pubs. A feature common to almost all Australian pubs, whether in the city, the suburbs or in rural and regional areas, was the provision of rooms that could be rented out as accommodation, usually located on the floors above the bars.

Unlike their ornate 19th-century predecessors, 20th century pub bars are relatively spartan in design and decoration. In most pubs the ceilings and upper walls were fairly plain, although some featured moulded Art Deco cornice and ceiling designs. The lower walls were typically tiled for ease of cleaning, and floors were usually paved with terrazzo and/or tiles.

=== Decorative art ===
Compared to America and Europe, relatively few large [[Art Deco]] and [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] buildings were constructed in Australia in the 1930s and 1940s. Few of these have survived the recent waves of urban redevelopment and most of Australia's fine Art Deco cinemas, shops, restaurants and office buildings were torn down in the late 20th century. Therefore, Australian pubs of the mid-20th century are among the best surviving examples of Art Deco and International Style urban architecture in Australia.

Although these newer pubs were generally far more utilitarian in design than their predecessors, one especially notable decorative feature of Australian pubs developed in the 1920s and 1930s – the iconic paint-on-glass beer advertisement.

This distinctive Australian graphic genre probably evolved from the elaborate back-painted bar mirrors of the 19th century. Often mounted on the outer walls of pubs, these eye-catching pieces were not printed posters or standard paintings. They were elaborate craft products created by teams of skilled commercial artists, many of whom were employed by the breweries for their entire working lives.

The creation of these beer ads was a specialised craft – they were entirely hand-painted in reverse on thick glass, and then wall-mounted in heavy brass frames, which were kept highly polished. Some exterior displays were made with translucent paint, so that they could be illuminated from behind. They featured striking and often highly stylised designs and compositions, painted in vibrant colours, and in many cases the text and some parts of the graphic were accentuated with real gold leaf.

They varied in size, but the larger examples were as much as a square metre in size or more. Like the example below, they typically depicted archetypal 'Aussie' sporting scenes – swimming, surfing, sailing, horse-racing, cricket or football – or social events such as picnics, dances and parties.

Many Deco-style pubs had sections of curved façade, because a large proportion of Australian pubs are built on street corners, and these spaces were often highlighted by the large curved frames of these colourfully painted beer ads.

Because of their inherent fragility and location, many of these marvellous works either deteriorated beyond repair or were destroyed by accident or vandalism. Over the years, as advertising materials (and the pubs themselves) were progressively modernised during the late 20th century, almost all the hand-painted beer ads were removed, but their distinctive style has become well-recognised and much-loved, and they are still a reference point in modern Australian commercial art. The best surviving examples are now museum pieces and expensive collectors' items.

== Pubs and social segregation ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2008}}
Perhaps the most striking functional difference between Australian pubs and drinking establishments in other countries is that, for most of their history, Australian pubs were strictly segregated along gender and racial lines.

As author Diane Kirkby has observed: "Masculinity and national identity were ... interwoven with pub culture and the ethnic and sexual exclusivity of that culture was celebrated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://australianpubs.20megsfree.com/custom.html |title=Looking Back |publisher=Australianpubs.20megsfree.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a controversial move in 2007, the [[Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal]] granted a [[gay bar]] in [[Collingwood, Victoria]] the right to refuse entry to heterosexuals and lesbians in order to preserve the bar's gay character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18927252/ns/world_news-weird_news/t/australian-gay-bar-allowed-ban-heterosexuals/ Australian gay bar allowed to ban heterosexuals Locale can even turn away lesbians to preserve atmosphere, court rules], Associated Press (May 29, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniella Miletic, [http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/straightout-ban-at-gay-venues-sparks-uproar/2007/05/28/1180205160437.html Straight-out ban at gay venues sparks uproar], ''The Age'' (May 29, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender segregation ===
The main bar of the typical Australian pub, usually the largest, was the so-called "Public Bar". However, this title was an ironic [[misnomer]], since until the 1970s, only men were permitted to drink in Public Bars.

Most pubs included a "Ladies' Lounge", furnished with chairs and tables, where women and men could drink together, but in many pubs women were usually only admitted to the Lounge Bar when accompanied by a male. It was also common for women not to be allowed to buy drinks for themselves.

Sexual segregation in pubs persisted into the 1970s and only began to break down after women's rights activists began to publicly challenge the convention. One of the most famous incidents in this informal campaign took place in January 1973, when a group of feminist activists staged a protest against the rule in the Public Bar of the Hotel Manly in Sydney.

When they entered and ordered drinks they were refused service by the publican, who typically claimed that the hotel had insufficient toilet facilities to cater for women. The women's response – deliberately echoing the tactics of the early [[Suffragettes]] – was to chain themselves to a railing that ran around the bar. The event gained wide media attention and caused the hotel industry considerable embarrassment; within a few years this long-standing sexist convention had virtually disappeared in most urban areas, and it was eventually enforced by state and federal anti-discrimination legislation.

=== Women in pubs ===

It has been found that, despite their long history of gender segregation, pubs provided an important source of income for many women.

Widowhood and wife desertion were much more common in 19th-century Australia than today, and in the absence of any [[social safety net]] for single mothers, women had to explore options to provide for their families, especially in remote areas. Pub-keeping provided jobs not only for widows and deserted wives, but also for many female ex-convicts.

It was comparatively lucrative work, so pub-keeping became a welcome and preferred option for many women. The evolution of the 'classic' pub and the women's roles in the pub developed concurrently in the mid-19th century, when the term "barmaid" first came into common usage.

Barmaids, like many other working women, had to fight against the 'traditional' gender challenges of lower pay rates and social stigmatisation. Unlike other classes of working women, such as domestic servants and shop staff, barmaids were often stigmatised and shunned. This discrimination was exacerbated by the "morals" campaigns that were waged around Australia from the 1880s to the 1920s, and religiously motivated temperance activists deliberately fostered a negative image of the barmaid as a "loose woman" who lured men into pubs to drink and squander their money.

The reality was often the exact opposite. Barmaids typically prided themselves on their ability to pour, chat, and keep a clean bar simultaneously – not to mention their ability to support themselves and their family – and they deeply resented this characterisation by prohibitionists, but the stereotype stuck. Even though many barmaids loved the job because it offered better pay and greater freedom than typical female occupations like household servants, barmaids remained the object of scorn by 'proper' society.

== Pubs as accommodation ==

Accommodation was another vital facet of Australian pub operation, and indeed it is the origin of the pub's "proper" business title, often required by licencing requirements –  Australian pubs are usually registered for business under the formal name "hotel", and the more upmarket pubs often reversed this, placing the word "Hotel" before the name (e.g. the Hotel Australia).

Many city, suburban and country pubs offered reasonably priced accommodation, as well as dining facilities for visitors and business people, and this tradition continues, with pubs joining together in an accommodation cooperative that operates under the name "PubStay".

Country-town and rural hotels were of crucial importance in the years before the advent of the [[motel]] and modern budget hotel chains. Moreover, licensing laws often required the provision of a minimum level of accommodation, differentiating hotels from bars which themselves came under pressure from de-licensing legislation from the late 1890s onwards. Until the later 20th century, a significant proportion of tourists, commercial travellers, business people and touring performers in Australia regularly relied on pub accommodation. As one former commercial traveller lamented in a recent [[Radio National|ABC Radio]] social history feature, the end of the era of pub accommodation also led to the disintegration of the social networks that centred on rural and regional pubs.

City and suburban pubs were an important accommodation source for country people visiting the cities for major events, such the annual [[Sydney Royal Easter Show]]. For single people, pubs also offered an alternative to boarding houses or rental housing, with many pubs renting rooms to long-term tenants who lived and ate at the pub, sometimes over periods of several decades.

== Australian pubs worldwide ==
There are an estimated 3,000 Australian themed pubs worldwide. They have been criticised for a lack of authenticity. They are particularly prevalent wherever expatriate communities are found, arguably due to a sense of connection to the [[Australian diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://travel.ninemsn.com.au/world/993203/worlds-best-aussie-bars |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208081544/http://travel.ninemsn.com.au/world/993203/worlds-best-aussie-bars |archive-date=8 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australiansabroad.com/hollandsite/bars.html|title=Australians Abroad – Holland – Bars|website=www.australiansabroad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Battlefield: Bad Company 2''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] firm [[EA DICE]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[iOS]] and [[Kindle Fire]] systems. It is a direct [[sequel]] to ''[[Battlefield: Bad Company]]'' and is part of the ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'' game series. It was released worldwide in March 2010. The iOS port was released on the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] on December 16, 2010.&lt;ref name="iOS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ie.ign.com/articles/2010/12/22/battlefield-bad-company-iphone-review|title=Battlefield Battlefield: Bad Company iPhone Review|date=December 22, 2010|last=Gallegos|first=Anthony|publisher=IGN|accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Kindle Fire version was released in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.droidgamers.com/index.php/tablet-gaming/tablet-gaming-news/4145-ea-announces-eight-games-now-available-for-the-kindle-fire|title=EA announces eight games now available for the Kindle Fire |publisher=DroidGamers|author=AndrewH|date=July 3, 2012|accessdate=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is primarily a [[squad]]-level first-person shooter based in a contemporary [[modern warfare]] setting. Additionally, the game includes a [[Single-player video game|single-player]] campaign, where the player re-assumes the role of Preston Marlowe, the [[protagonist]] of the original game. The game's [[Frostbite (game engine)|Frostbite 1.5]] engine allows for destructible environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5190403/battlefield-bad-company-2-ups-the-destruction |title=Battlefield Bad Company 2 Ups the Destruction |publisher=Kotaku|last=Crecente|first=Brian |date=March 30, 2009|accessdate=January 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Multiplayer video game|Multiplayer]] maps, which allow for five different game modes, contain a wide selection of vehicles, aircraft and emplacements.

The game was met with positive reception from critics, garnering a [[weighted arithmetic mean|mean]] of 88 from aggregator [[Metacritic]] for the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, and 87 for the PC version. It became a commercial success, selling more than twelve million units since its initial release. Seven VIP map packs, as well as a [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] game mode, were added after launch; an expansion pack, ''[[Battlefield: Bad Company 2: Vietnam]]'' (centered on the [[Vietnam War]]), released on December 21, 2010.

==Gameplay==
While ''Bad Company 2'' is primarily a first-person shooter, it follows other games in the series by allowing the player to control certain vehicles, including [[All-terrain vehicle|ATVs]], [[armoured personnel carrier|APCs]], tanks, and helicopters. On foot, players are given access to a variety of real-world small arms such as [[assault rifle]]s and [[machine gun]]s. Players can also jump, crouch, and sprint. They can carry one primary weapon and a [[Handgun|pistol]] in multiplayer, or two primary weapons in single-player, as well as [[Hand grenade|grenade]]s and other equipment. Players can fire "from the hip", but zooming in and using [[iron sight]]s, [[Reflector sight|reflex sights]], or [[telescopic sight]]s (depending on the weapon) will provide much better accuracy when shooting.

''Bad Company 2'' heavily emphasizes destructible environments. Large sections of most buildings can be destroyed by explosives, and some walls and fences break down under barrages of bullets, with the game's [[physics engine]] realistically simulating the destruction.

The game utilizes a "[[Health (gaming)#Recharging health|regenerating health]]" system, rather than giving players [[health (gaming)|health points]] as older games in the ''Battlefield'' series have done. To accommodate this in multiplayer, the "Medic" equipment now accelerates health regeneration rather than directly restoring the player's health. If a player is wounded, he or she must take cover and avoid damage in order to regain health. A heavily wounded player will see dirt and blood around the edges of the screen.

===Single-player===
''Bad Company 2'' features a story-driven single-player campaign. For most of the narrative, the player takes control of Preston Marlowe, one of the members of the titular "Bad Company". The exception to this is the first mission, which is set prior to the rest of the campaign. Each mission is divided into a series of objectives, often interspersed with [[cutscene]]s which simulate the style of [[war film]]s. While the other members of Bad Company will engage in combat, the game relies upon the player to complete the objectives and kill most of the enemies. Although the player's [[Non-player character|computer-controlled]] allies can never die, they cannot carry out objectives. Aside from [[infantry]] combat, the campaign contains several missions in which the player controls a vehicle, or mans a weapon turret while a teammate controls the vehicle.

Each weapon in the campaign is considered a collectible - the first time the player picks up that type of weapon, a "Collectable Unlocked" message appears. There are also sensor stations throughout the campaign which the player can find and destroy - this is also recorded in the campaign stats. "Supply Drop" crates are scattered throughout the missions, where the player can exchange weapons and replenish ammo. The Supply Drop crates will remember any weapon the player picks up and this weapon will then be available for the rest of the campaign.

===Multiplayer===
[[File:Bad Company 2 multiplayer.jpg|left|thumb|Screenshot of ''Battlefield: Bad Company 2's'' multiplayer mode. The player is armed with an [[M249 light machine gun]].]]
Multiplayer is class-based, with four classes: Assault, Engineer, Medic, and Recon. Each class has a variety of unique weapons and equipment, and serves a specific role in combat. There are also some weapons that can be used by any class, such as pistols and [[shotgun]]s. Each class gains experience and levels up separately.

New items are unlocked by earning [[experience point]]s, which are gained for performing actions conducive to the goals of the player's team, such as eliminating enemy players, healing team mates, or capturing or defending points of interest. These points count towards a total of 50 ranks. Bonuses to the base number of points can be awarded under certain circumstances (such as eliminating an enemy by means of a headshot).

Multiplayer mode features 15 vehicles, including new additions, such as the [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk]], a [[quad bike]], a four-man [[patrol boat]], a personal [[watercraft]], a [[ZU-23-2]] mounted on a [[BMD-3]] armoured personnel carrier, and a [[Northrop Grumman MQ-8 Fire Scout]], controlled via remote computer terminals. The available maps are set in various environments such as [[South America]] and [[Alaska]], near the borders of [[Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Porter |first=Will |date=May 2009|title='EA has promised dense jungles…'|journal=Official Xbox Magazine |issue=46 |page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to those seen in the single-player.

A [[dog tag]] system, as seen in ''[[Battlefield 2142]]'' and ''Battlefield: Bad Company'', is also used, awarding players with their opponents' dog tags when they defeat them with a knife attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/985/985866p1.html |title=Pre-E3 2009: Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Multiplayer Hands-on |last=Miller |first=Greg |date=May 22, 2009|publisher=IGN |accessdate=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players can use party chat for each game mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/battlefield-bad-company-2/1053497p1.html |title=Bad Company 2 Will Not Block Party Chat |publisher=[[GameSpy]]|last=Barber|first=Tyler |date=December 9, 2009|accessdate=January 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game uses the [[PunkBuster]] anti-cheat program to protect from cheaters in online multiplayer matches.

''Bad Company 2'' features several game types:

'''Conquest:''' Features the classic gameplay of the ''Battlefield'' series. Players must capture and defend flags for as long as possible. If a base is taken, it can be recaptured, and the cycle can repeat until the game's end. Every kill depletes one ticket, and tickets gradually decrease when one team controls more than half of the flags on the map. Vehicles can spawn once a flag is captured. When one team's tickets are depleted, that team will lose the game. Lost tickets can be regained by reviving fallen team mates.

'''Onslaught:''' Tasks one squad of up to four players to capture certain points on the map, allowing the squad to advance. The game is won by capturing all the points. Unlike other modes, the only enemies are [[Video game bot|bots]]. This game mode features new lighting and time of day on existing maps, as well as new vehicles. It is available for Xbox 360 and PS3 only; a PC version was planned, but was cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefront.com/battlefield-193-and-bad-company-2-onslaught-mode-both-cancelled-for-pc/ |title=Battlefield 1943 and Bad Company 2 Onslaught Mode Both Cancelled for PC |last=Whitaker |first=Ron |date=February 3, 2011 |publisher=[[GameFront]] |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rush:''' Players must defend or destroy pairs of M-COM stations until either the attackers run out of [[Spawning (video gaming)|respawn]] tickets or all of the stations are destroyed. Lost tickets can be regained by reviving fallen team mates. An M-COM station can be destroyed by planting a charge, using explosive weapons or ballistics, or simply by demolishing the building in which it is located. However, not all M-COM stations exist in destructible buildings, forcing players to use a variety of methods to achieve the same goal. When a charge is planted by the attacking team, an alarm is activated and the defenders have a limited amount of time to get to the M-COM station and disarm the bomb before it detonates.

'''Squad Deathmatch:''' Features up to four squads, each fighting against the other. An infantry support vehicle is available for any squad to claim, giving a significant advantage. The first squad to score fifty kills wins the match.

'''Squad Rush:''' Similar to Rush, but consists of only two squads, one defending and the other attacking. The maps used for Squad Rush are smaller versions of those for both Conquest and Rush modes. There are only 2 M-COM stations in each round.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
''Bad Company 2'' is set in the near future during the fictional Second Russo-American War between the [[United States]] and [[Russian Federation]], the latter supporting the fictional Latin American Militia, a rebel group operating in [[South America]].

===Plot===
The game begins in October 1944, as a group of US [[commando]]s infiltrate an [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]-controlled island in the [[Sea of Japan]] as part of "Operation Aurora." They secure a Japanese scientist who was working on a secret scalar weapon, and escape the island on a submarine. However, as foreshadowed by the scientist's warnings, the commandos witness the weapon firing and subsequently perish from the resulting [[tsunami]], sparking a myth within the U.S. Army.

In  2008, Privates Preston Marlowe, Terrence Sweetwater, George Haggard and Sergeant Samuel Redford are fighting in Russia in an attempt to secure a scalar weapon device. Despite evading Russian soldiers and completing the mission successfully, the device is discovered to be a fake. Impressed with their previous activities, Army General Braidwood has the squad transferred into the [[Special Activities Division]] and assigns them a new mission; to contact Agent James Wyatt (called Aguire in-game), much to the disappointment of Redford, who had hoped to retire after the previous mission.

The squad travels to [[Bolivia]] in search of the agent, and after many firefights, they eventually save Aguire. He sends them to retrieve his scalar technology intelligence from a French [[weather satellite]] that can be controlled from a base in the [[Andes]]. Sweetwater lands the satellite and the squad successfully defeat a Russian attempt to destroy it. Marlowe locates the data server and proceeds to descend the mountain during a blizzard while dodging Russian patrols. He survives, and is extracted by the others.

During extraction, Aguire briefs the squad about the man responsible for rebuilding scalar weaponry; Arkady Kirilenko, a Russian Army colonel the squad encountered in Russia. Kirilenko is hoping to use scalar weaponry to disable America's [[Electrical grid|power grid]] and pave the way for a Russian [[Mainland invasion of the United States|invasion]]. He is believed to be hiding in [[Chile]]. The squad head there, aided by US forces, and find Kirilenko, who escapes again. Left with only Kirilenko's papers, Sweetwater discovers there is a shipping manifest for an abandoned ship called the ''Sangre Del Toro''. Aided by the rest of the squad, Marlowe finds the ship and retrieves a compound essential to the use of the weapon, while also discovering the truth behind Operation Aurora - the US military knew it was a suicide mission, and the operation was planned in order to learn more about the weapon's capabilities.

While attempting to meet Aguire in [[Ecuador]], the squad's helicopter is shot down and they are separated. Along with their helicopter pilot, Flynn ([[Eric Loren]]), they regroup and escape the local militia. Redford gives Aguire the compound before finding out that Aguire has double-crossed them by allying himself with Kirilenko. Aguire reveals that he wants revenge against the United States for what happened to his father, Thomas Wyatt (one of the commandos killed in 1944 during Operation Aurora). Despite this, Kirilenko betrays Aguire and kills him. Before he can kill the squad, however, Flynn intervenes and saves them at the cost of his own life.

While the squad is mourning Flynn, they hear Kirilenko talking through a guard's radio. Marlowe knifes the guard and the squad proceeds toward the city of [[Quito]]. Here, after battling squads of South American and Russian troops, they find a large [[Antonov An-225 Mriya|An-225]] [[cargo aircraft]] that is believed to house the scalar weapon. This is confirmed as a powerful [[electromagnetic pulse]] is suddenly released, disabling all electronic equipment in the city except the aircraft. Haggard and Sweetwater become disheartened, with Haggard going so far as suggesting the squad abort the mission. Angry at his allies for giving up, Marlowe is about to continue the mission alone before Redford stops him and then convinces the rest to continue. They then infiltrate the aircraft as it takes off. After a firefight to reach the cockpit, they find it empty. They return to the [[Loading dock|cargo bay]] to find Kirilenko attempting to fire the scalar weapon again, this time high over the southern United States. With the help of explosives from the plane's armory, they access and destroy the scalar weapon.

The explosion sends the aircraft plummeting, forcing the squad to bail out, but Kirilenko grabs the last parachute before Marlowe. In [[free fall]], Marlowe kills Kirilenko, and is then saved by Sweetwater who hands Marlowe the parachute that was stolen by Kirilenko. The squad lands in [[Texas]], Haggard's home state. Shortly after, General Braidwood arrives to inform them that they are to aid the US Army against an incoming Russian invasion that recently passed through [[Alaska]] and [[Canada]], much to the squad's disappointment.

==Development==
The game was first announced in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/950/950715p1.html|title=Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Announced|last=Ahearn|first=Nate|date=February 3, 2009|publisher=IGN|accessdate=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 19, game developer DICE posted a [[Twitter]] announcement stating the game will have [[Dedicated hosting service|dedicated server]] support. This was in response to [[Infinity Ward]]'s announcement on October 17 that ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'' would not support dedicated servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cullen|first=Johnny |url=http://www.vg247.com/2009/10/19/dice-dedicated-servers-is-a-given/ |title=DICE: Dedicated servers are a "given" |publisher= [[VG247]] |date=October 19, 2009|accessdate=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A PS3 version of the [[Betaware|beta]] began development on November 19,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.battlefield.ea.com/battlefield_bad_company/archive/2009/12/14/ps3-beta-update.aspx |title=PS3 Beta Update!|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|last=VanDyke|first=Gordon |date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=July 10, 2013|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100512200509/http://blogs.battlefield.ea.com/battlefield_bad_company/archive/2009/12/14/ps3-beta-update.aspx| archivedate= May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the PC version was pushed back until February 2010 because of difficulties with PC varieties.

The online multiplayer demo for the Xbox 360 and the [[closed beta]] for the PC were released on January 28, 2010, and [[Server (computing)|server]]s ran until February 25. The demo was released on the PS3 on February 4, 2010 in Europe and North America and February 11, 2010 in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.battlefield.ea.com/battlefield_bad_company/archive/2010/02/04/battlefield-bad-company-2-ps3-multiplayer-demo-is-here.aspx |title=Battlefield Bad Company 2 PS3 Multiplayer Demo is Coming Today!|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|last=VanDyke|first=Gordon|date=February 4, 2010 |accessdate=July 10, 2013| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100524094837/http://blogs.battlefield.ea.com/battlefield_bad_company/archive/2010/02/04/battlefield-bad-company-2-ps3-multiplayer-demo-is-here.aspx| archivedate= May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PS3 beta featured the map "Arica Harbor", while the PC beta, Xbox 360 demo, and PS3 demo featured the map "Port Valdez".

During an interview with GameZone's Dakota Grabowski in March 2010, Senior Producer Patrick Bach revealed that following the negative feedback from PC gamers after the first ''Battlefield: Bad Company'' was not released on the PC, Electronic Arts and DICE had a separate dedicated team working on the PC version of ''Bad Company 2''. Bach stated "We see it as very, very hardcore and important part of our customers. So we put a lot of effort into making sure that everything worked perfect." Bach also commented on the use of peripherals such as a mouse and keyboard on consoles, saying "I don't think that we have any special connections to peripherals to the consoles [...] The biggest problem with peripherals for consoles is that the console itself is a level playground. It's even and you know the consumer has the same technology and have the same peripherals and same controls – which makes it easier for us to create a game that feels fair. By catering to a mouse and keyboard for the consoles, it would maybe skew the even playground."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grabowski|first=Dakota |url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/03_01_10_11_00AM.htm/|title=Battlefield: Bad Company 2 – "We take our PC Games Seriously" |publisher= GameZone |date=March 1, 2010|accessdate=July 10, 2013| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100304131520/http://www.gamezone.com/news/03_01_10_11_00AM.htm| archivedate= March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PC version of the game was co-developed with fellow Swedish developer Coldwood Interactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/jbripley/status/610545260276617218|title=Joakim Bodin - Twitter |first=Joaki|last=Bodin |work=[[Twitter]]|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Audio===
The game uses [[Dolby Digital]] and Frostbite's High Definition Audio Range technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cullinane|first=Justin |url=http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/pc/games/162024/reviews/134575.Battlefield-Bad-Company-2/|title=Battlefield Bad Company 2 Review|publisher= GamePlanet|date=March 3, 2010 |accessdate=July 10, 2013| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120717055630/http://www.gameplanet.co.nz/pc/games/175500.Battlefield-Bad-Company-2/reviews/134575.Battlefield-Bad-Company-2/| archivedate= July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score was composed by Mikael Karlsson and is featured on the ''Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Official Soundtrack'', which was released on February 2, 2010.&lt;ref name="composer"/&gt;

==Marketing and release==

===Editions===
As a pre-order promotion, EA offered the "Limited Edition" of ''Bad Company 2'' at normal pricing. By pre-ordering the Limited Edition, buyers of the PC version were given early access to the closed beta from January 28 to February 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hooks|first=Jerard  |url=http://daxgamer.com/2010/01/bad-company-2-pc-beta-details-confirmed/ |title=Bad Company 2 PC beta details confirmed |publisher= Daxgamer |date=January 8, 2010|accessdate=May 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owners of the Limited Edition on all systems were also given early access to numerous weapons and vehicle perks, which included the [[Thompson submachine gun|M1A1 Thompson]] and an [[M1911 pistol]], as well as four vehicle perks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.battlefield.ea.com/battlefield_bad_company/archive/2009/10/29/battlefield-bad-company-2-limited-edition-unviel.aspx |title=Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Limited Edition Unveil|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|last=Ladee|first=Dragon|date=October 29, 2010|accessdate=July 10, 2013| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100629172911/http://blogs.battlefield.ea.com/battlefield_bad_company/archive/2009/10/29/battlefield-bad-company-2-limited-edition-unviel.aspx | archivedate=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the six upgrades offered by EA on all pre-orders of the Limited Edition, select retailers offered their own incentives. Copies pre-ordered at [[GameStop]], for example, came with an additional code, unlocking the [[AKS-74U]] [[carbine]] and giving access to the Squad Rush game mode 30 days early (North America only). All six Limited Edition upgrades, as well as the AKS-74U, are also available to owners of the Standard Edition of the game, but they must be acquired by accumulating points in-game.

The "Ultimate Edition" was released on August 31, 2010 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The package includes ''Battlefield: Bad Company 2'', ''[[Battlefield 1943]]'',  "Onslaught" mode, and immediate access to four vehicle upgrades and two weapon unlocks from purchase, a bonus originally included only in the Limited Edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sliwinski |first=Alexander |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2010/08/31/battlefield-bad-company-2-ultimate-edition-officially-announced/ |title=Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Ultimate Edition officially announced - and released |publisher= Joystiq|date=August 31, 2001|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Battlefield: Bad Company 2'' received mostly positive reviews from game critics. Aggregating review websites [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]] have the PlayStation 3 version at 88.83%&lt;ref name="GRPS3" /&gt; and 88/100&lt;ref name="MCPS3" /&gt; respectively, the Xbox 360 version at 89.03%&lt;ref name="GRX360" /&gt; and 88/100,&lt;ref name="MCXbox" /&gt; and the PC version at 88.34%&lt;ref name="GRPC" /&gt; and 87.&lt;ref name="MCPC" /&gt; The iOS version received generally poorer reviews and holds scores of 73.33%&lt;ref name="GRiOS" /&gt; and 64/100.&lt;ref name="MCiOS" /&gt;

GameZone's Steven Hopper gave the game 9.25/10, saying, "Even though the single-player campaign still isn't where it needs to be, ''Bad Company 2'' is definitely a great sequel that builds on its predecessor in every way, making for one that no shooter fan will want to miss, especially if you go online for your gaming."&lt;ref name="gamezone" /&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' gave the game 9.5 out of 10, praising the improvements made over the first ''Bad Company''.&lt;ref name="GI" /&gt; [[GameTrailers]] gave the game 9.1 out of 10, praising its use of an intertwining multiplayer in which "Purists will appreciate that you must earn every kill." Level design was also commended; "Bad Company 2 features sprawling, densely populated environments with an excellent level of detail." However, they referred to the single-player mode as "predictable."&lt;ref name="GT" /&gt;

[[GameSpy]] reviewer Anthony Gallegos gave the game 4.5 stars out of 5, describing the single-player campaign as "a blast" and concluding that "the staying power for BFBC2 lies in its multiplayer."&lt;ref name="gamespy" /&gt; Dan Whitehead from [[Eurogamer]] reviewed the game and gave it a score of 9/10, describing it as an "open challenge" to [[Activision]]'s market leader, ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2'', and calling ''Bad Company 2'' a "way superior game" when compared to ''Modern Warfare 2''. Whitehead also commented that it had "immediately evident" improvements over the previous game in the series, and concluded that ''Bad Company 2'' is "the online shooter at its most streamlined, most thoughtful, most exhilarating."&lt;ref name="eurogamer" /&gt; [[IGN]] gave the game 8.9 out of 10, praising the visuals as being "near-photo realistic" and calling it "one of the best looking games around."&lt;ref name="ign" /&gt;

'''''Blue Defense!''''' (formerly '''''Defend!''''') is an iOS game by Canadian developer [[John Kooistra]]&lt;ref name="original ta review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toucharcade.com/2008/11/12/defend-a-simple-but-effective-099-iphone-shooter/|title=Blue Defense! Review - Touch Arcade|work=Touch Arcade}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released on Jan 31, 2009. A sequel entitled '''''Blue Defense: Second Wave!''''' was developed by [[Cat in a Box Games]] and released on September 30, 2010. '''''Blue Attack!''''' is a spin-off.

==Critical reception==

===Blue Defense!===
TouchArcade said "Progressive levels are increasingly challenging and provides a good amount of gameplay. Normally, we frown upon games without sound, but for $0.99 and an otherwise fun game, we can overlook it".&lt;ref name="original ta review" /&gt; Appadvice wrote "''Blue Defense!'' is a fun little game that doesn't clutter up the experience with anything. Those looking for something reminiscent of arcade classics like ''[[Space Invaders]]'', ''[[Galaga]]'', or other vertical shooters will be pleased. If you don't like primary colors, silence, or are afraid of your [[iPhone]] getting motion sickness, this game is not for you. Personally, I enjoyed it for a day and didn't open it up again until this review".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appadvice.com/appnn/2008/12/review-blue-defense|title=Review: Blue Defense!|author=David Marcus|work=AppAdvice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  TouchMyApps said "''Blue Defense!'' is tastefully designed and brimming with twists, turns and tongue biting.  Its polished graphics, smooth animation and habit-forming gameplay are praiseworthy, but without sound and a global scoring system it feels somewhat unfinished.  So, is it worth the 99 cents?  Absolutely".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touchmyapps.com/2008/11/19/blue-defense-in-review-saving-earth%E2%80%99s-billions-one-twist-at-a-time/|title=TouchMyApps|work=TouchMyApps}}&lt;/ref&gt; 148Apps wrote "Fantastic, simple, fun, wonderful game. Very unexpected but very much appreciated. Easily one of my favorite games thus far for the iPhone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.148apps.com/reviews/blue-defense/|title=Blue Defense [Updated] » 148Apps » iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch App Reviews and News|work=148Apps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue Defense: Second Wave!===
''Blue Defense: Second Wave!'' has a [[Metacritic]] score of 85% based on 7 critic reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/ios/blue-defense-second-wave!|title=Blue Defense: Second Wave!|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AppSmile said "Following in the style of the original ''Blue Defense'', ''Second Wave'' offers some additional control methods and a bunch of game modes to keep you busy as you blast invading forces and climb the leaderboards. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.appsmile.com/2010/09/29/blue-defense-second-wave-review/&lt;/ref&gt; NoDPad wrote "As a sequel, '''Blue Defense: Second Wave''' captures everything that was great about the first game, refines it, builds upon it, ups the ante manifold. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nodpad.com/2010/09/29/blue-defense-second-wave-review-brilliant/|title=Blue Defense: Second Wave! Review: Brilliant! «  No DPad - The latest in iPhone and iPod Touch gaming reviews, previews and news.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 148Apps said "It's just hard to come up with a list of complaints about this game, because of how well made it is. ''Blue Defense: Second Wave'' is original, intense, addictive, and most of all, fun. Fan of [[action games]] on iOS deserve to give this game a shot. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.148apps.com/reviews/blue-defense-wave-review-september-30th/|title=Blue Defense: Second Wave Review » 148Apps » iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch App Reviews and News|work=148Apps}}&lt;/ref&gt; AppSpy said "''Blue Defense: Second Wave!'' is a great sequel to what was already a great title and while the tilt controls may be a bit gimmicky, the gameplay is almost second to none. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appspy.com/review/4305/blue-defense-second-wave-review|title=Blue Defense: Second Wave! Review|author=Andrew Nesvadba|date=1 October 2010|work=appspy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Touchgen said "A brilliant game to play for that ten minute break, or on the bus. It lacks long term appeal due to both being so intense, and because there are too many modes and choices to make. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.touchgen.net/blue-defense-second-wave-review&lt;/ref&gt; Multiplayer.it wrote "Although way better than the previous chapter, ''Blue Defense: Second Wave!'' is certainly less ambitious than ''[[Red Conquest]]''. It must be said though that even if the game lacks any real additional mode, plot or multiplayer experience, the new units and the deeper control system will satisfy any hardcore gamer that thought the first ''Blue Defense'' was too easy. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://multiplayer.it/recensioni/81402-blue-defense-second-wave-un-pianeta-da-difendere-di-nuovo.html|title=Blue Defense: Second Wave!|author=Vincenzo Lettera|date=13 October 2010|work=Multiplayer.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pocket Gamer UK said "Blue Defense: Second Wave! is amusing when played to fill a free minute or two, but it lacks the depth needed to encourage extended play. "&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pocketgamer.co.uk/r/iPhone/Blue+Defense%3A+Second+Wave!/review.asp?c=23902&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue Attack!===
IGN said "This is a great little space shooter for $2. I like the weapon upgrades and different formations. The game is a challenge when it comes to beating the clock, perhaps too much of a challenge that it closes off parts of the game. Still, it's a worthy addition to your shooter library."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2009/02/02/blue-attack-iphone-review|title=Blue Attack! iPhone Review|work=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Capitol Steps''' are an [[United States|American]] political-[[satire]] group which has been performing since 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/capitol-steps-go-into-comedy-overdrive-during-government-shutdown/2013/10/03/2937be12-2b7d-11e3-97a3-ff2758228523_story.htm |title= Capitol Steps Go Into Comedy Overdrive During Government Shutdown| work= [[The Washington Post]]| date= October 3, 2013 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Capitol Steps' material parodies well-known contemporary songs, usually introduced with a short skit. The songs are interspersed with other routines, including a [[spoonerism]] routine ("Lirty Dies") near the end of each performance with [[innuendo]]es about recent scandals. They have released over 40 albums, primarily song [[parody|parodies]]. Originally consisting of [[United States Congress|congressional]] staffers who performed around [[Washington, D.C.]], the troupe is now primarily made up of professional actors and singers. The Capitol Steps have performed on [[PBS]], [[public radio]] and in small- and medium-size venues around the United States.

==Reagan years==
In 1981, three [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Congress|congressional]] staffers ([[William Strauss|Bill Strauss]], Elaina Newport,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/2004/01/25/elaina-newport-co-founder-the-capitol-steps-comedy-troupe-washington/b0040c1d-389e-42ef-9562-0a4ee995853b/|title=Elaina Newport, Co-Founder, the Capitol Steps comedy troupe, Washington|date=25 January 2004|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.weta.org/boundarystones/2016/10/27/capitol-steps-washingtons-own-political-satire-troupe|title=The Capitol Steps: Washington's Own Political Satire Troupe|first=|last=WETA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/entertainment/article182223301.html|title=Their material is ripped from the headlines, but The Capitol Steps comedy troupe doesn’t take it too seriously|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://charlierose.com/guests/9449|title=Elaina Newport - Charlie Rose|website=Charlie Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/06/30/capitol.steps/newport.q.a/|title=AllPolitics - Capitol Steps: Elaina Newport Interview|website=www.cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/01/movies/theater-in-review-capitol-steps-between-iraq-and-a-hard-place.html|title=Capitol Steps -- 'Between Iraq and a Hard Place'|date=1 August 2003|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://viewingamerica.shanti.virginia.edu/sites/shanti.virginia.edu.viewingamerica/files/cyou/CYOU2004/fall/political_humor/70s.html|title=hi|website=viewingamerica.shanti.virginia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Crisis-Inflames-Bias-Against-Asians-Ethnic-2931872.php|title=Crisis Inflames Bias Against Asians / Ethnic stereotypes in broadcast, print media prompt protests|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jim Aidala) used their spare time at the Subcommittee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation, and Government Processes of the Senate Committee of Governmental Affairs to write and sing [[parody|parodies]] of current events. Joined by fellow Republican Senate staffers Nancy Baskin, Barbie Granzow and Dave Nichols, they decided on a [[Christmas]] show as their first performance while continuing to work full-time as congressional staffers. They chose "The Capitol Steps" as their group name because of a [[sex scandal]] earlier that year in which Congressman [[John Jenrette]] had sex with his wife, [[Rita Jenrette|Rita]], on the steps of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/capitol-steps-turn-30/2011/12/28/gIQATJaLNP_story.html|title=Capitol Steps turn 30|date=December 28, 2011|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=May 13, 2017|author=Lonnae O'Neal Parker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first show was a December 11, 1981 Christmas party for the [[United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]].&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; The performers, considering the show a success, performed the same songs several more times that month. In 1982, the group expanded to include [[United States House of Representatives|House]] staffers and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. Despite being predominantly Republican, they tried to make their shows bipartisan with a roughly-even mix of songs lampooning Democrats and Republicans. Although the group attracted media interest at the time, they refused interview requests out of concern that their jobs could be endangered by press coverage and their behavior might affect Strauss and Newport's subcommittee chair [[Charles H. Percy]].

In February 1983, the Capitol Steps began to perform monthly at the [[Shoreham Hotel]] and became open to publicity for the first time. They received a favorable review in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', and their performances were successful. In November 1984, they performed at Percy's election-night party; during the party they learned that the senator had lost the election, and Strauss and Newport would lose their jobs with him. Shortly afterwards, the Capitol Steps became a professional group and recorded their first album: ''[[Capitol Steps Live! at the Shoreham]]''.  In the fall of 1986 the Capitol Steps began performing on a regular basis at Chelsea's Cabaret in the Georgetown area.

Three years later,{{when|date=January 2018}} the group decided to quit their full-time jobs. At this time, they included David Gencarelli, Richard Paul, Anne Hill, Ann Schmitt, Brian Ash, and Mike Loomis; all except Loomis and Gencarelli were still with the group in 2012 with Newport. In September 1988, the Capitol Steps performed at the [[White House]] for an audience which included President [[Ronald Reagan]], his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]], and hundreds of members of Congress. Through an aide, Reagan asked the group to perform songs poking fun at him; they obliged, and the president enjoyed the show. The Capitol Steps released five albums during Reagan's two presidential terms, including ''Thank God I'm A Contra Boy'', ''We Arm the World'', and ''Workin' 9 to 10''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?124305-1/capitol-steps|title=Capitol Steps, Apr 10 1984 - Video - C-SPAN.org|website=C-SPAN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/events/antitrust_law/2016/04/at_capitol_steps.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==George H. W. Bush years==
[[Image:CapStepsatCUA 3344.jpg|thumb|alt=Three men onstage in judicial robes|2008 skit at the  [[Catholic University of America]]]]
The Capitol Steps expanded their repertoire of material to include international and foreign policy affairs (such as the [[United States invasion of Panama]]) and local gaffes (such as [[George Herbert Walker Bush]]'s recognition of September 7 as [[Pearl Harbor Day]]) after Bush's 1988 election. The group became known for parodying Vice President [[Dan Quayle]], particularly after Quayle's infamous correction of a child's spelling of "potato" by telling him to add a final ''-e''.

The Capitol Steps released six albums during the elder Bush's presidency, including ''Stand By Your Dan'', ''76 Bad Loans'', and ''Georgie on My Mind'', and performed several times at the White House. On three occasions, the president accepted the group's invitation to sing songs poking fun at himself with them onstage.

==Clinton years==
Before the [[Lewinsky scandal]], [[Bill Clinton]]'s administration provided fodder for new songs and albums and a variety of personalities who were easy to exaggerate: the easygoing Clinton and the First Lady, [[Hillary Clinton|Hillary]], Vice-President [[Al Gore]] and several Surgeon General [[Joycelyn Elders]], who had suggested that [[masturbation]] could be a useful part of a comprehensive sex-education curriculum.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"/&gt;

In 1994, the Capitol Steps performed at the White House for Clinton and Gore.

==George W. Bush years==
The [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]] yielded the pre-election "I Want a Brand New Pair of Candidates" and several other songs about the aborted recount.

The popular impression of [[George W. Bush]]'s intellect, fed by his frequent grammatical errors in speeches, allowed the Capitol Steps to reuse much Dan Quayle material. After the events of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001]], jokes aimed at the president or  American politics no longer seemed appropriate to the general public. The group cancelled most of their performances for the next several weeks, performing an edited show at a nightclub on September 15. It was successful, and they soon found new material that people would find funny in October 2001. The group poked fun at the improved national view of Bush and at figures who were becoming more relevant to the American public, including [[New York City|New York]] Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]], [[United Kingdom|British]] Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], and [[France|French]] President [[Jacques Chirac]].

Heightened security nationwide soon became a popular subject for the Capitol Steps and other comedians in the wake of media reports that travelers were being questioned in airports for having powdered sugar from a [[donut]] on their clothing. By the end of the year, the group was poking fun at terrorists.

In 2002 and 2003, their material lampooned [[SUV]]s and their drivers, [[Hans Blix]], the collapse of [[Enron]], the standoff with [[Saddam Hussein]], [[Condoleezza Rice]], Democratic hopefuls for the [[2004 Democratic National Convention|2004 presidential nomination]], the capture of Saddam Hussein, same-sex weddings, the [[Kobe Bryant]] [[Kobe Bryant sexual assault case|trial]], and the [[California]] [[California recall election, 2003|gubernatorial recall election]] (in which they reused "The Fondler"—a Clinton-era parody of "The Wanderer"—with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] as the target). Since 2004 the Capitol Steps have remained topical with their parodies, releasing songs about the marriage of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and [[Camilla, The Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla Parker Bowles]], U.S. immigration-reform-law proposals, and the [[Tom DeLay]] scandals.
On December 18, 2007, group co-founder Bill Strauss died at his home in McLean, Virginia of [[pancreatic cancer]].

==Obama years==
[[Image:CapStepsatCUA 3304.jpg|thumb|alt=Woman holding a picture of Barack Obama|Obama campaign skit with cast member Felicia Curry]]
They released several albums during the Obama administration, including ''Mock the Vote'', ''How to Succeed in Congress without Really Lying'', ''Fiscal Shades of Gray'', ''Take the Money and Run for President'', ''Desperate Housemembers'', ''Liberal Shop of Horrors'', and ''Obama Mia''.

==Trump years==
They released ''Orange Is the New Barack'' in 2017.

==Live Shows==

In 2008, Mark Eaton stated they had booked over 700 shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bendsource.com/bend/politics-is-a-joke-creating-caricatures-on-the-capitol-steps/Content?oid=2141570|title=Politics is a Joke: Creating caricatures on the Capitol Steps|first=Eric|last=Flowers|website=The Source Weekly - Bend}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the Capitol Steps had multiple casts, with 24 cast members:{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Recordings==
Since their first album in 1984, the Capitol Steps have released a new recording of their songs, parodies, and sketches at least once a year (usually in the late spring). The group has also released holiday recordings in 1989, 1993 and 2006. A 2001 "special high school release", revised and re-released in 2005, is made up of songs written for participants of the [[National Young Leaders Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/education/edlife/leadership-t.html|title=Congratulations!

Their 20th-anniversary book included a CD retrospective of their work.

'''Clown society''' is a term used in [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]] for an organization of comedic entertainers ([[Heyoka]] or "clowns") who have a formalized role in a culture or society.

==Description and function==
Sometimes clown societies have a sacred role, to represent a [[trickster]] character in religious ceremonies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Other times the purpose served by members of a clown society is only to [[parody]] excessive seriousness, or to deflate pomposity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

In the sense of how clowns function in their culture:{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}
*A clown shows what is wrong with the ordinary way of doing things.
*A clown shows how to do ordinary things in a different fashion that is revealing of what would otherwise be perceived as the serious or true state of things.

Members of a clown society may dress in a special [[costume]] reserved for  clowns, which is often a [[ridiculous]]ly extreme or improper form of normal dress.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Some members paint their body with horizontal black and white stripes, which represent a [[skeleton]].&lt;ref&gt;Lotsee Patterson, Mary Ellen Snodgrass (1994) ''Indian terms of the Americas'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=V7L54EZ5M1AC&amp;pg=PA122 p.122]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cazeneuve1957p242"&gt;Cazeneuve (1957) p.242 quotation: {{quotation|...leur corps est peint souvent de raies blanches et noires qui leur donnent plus ou moins l'apparence de squelettes.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the [[Zuni people|Zuni]] clown society of the [[Pueblo Indians]], "one is initiated into the [[Ne'wekwe]] order by a ritual of filth-eating" where "[[mud]] are smeared on the body for the [[clown]] performance, and parts of the performance may consist of sporting with mud, smearing and daubing it, or drinking and pouring it onto one another".&lt;ref name="Parsons34"&gt;{{cite journal

While in their costume, clowns have special permission from their society to parody or criticize defective aspects of their own culture. They are always required to be funny. Other persons living within the same culture may recognize a clown when they see one, but seldom consciously understand what the clowns do for their society. The typical explanation is "He's just a funny man."{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

In the case of the [[jester]] at the English Royal Court with his cap of bells and [[pig's bladder]] stick he was allowed to make fun of, be indelicate and sometimes downright rude to members of the royal family and their entourage without fear of reprisal.

Clown societies usually train new members to become clowns. The training normally takes place by an [[apprentice]] system, although there may be some rote schooling as well.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Sometimes the training is [[improvisational comedy]], but usually a clown society trains members in well known forms of costume, pantomime, song, dance, and common visual gags. Occasionally these include a scripted performance, or skit, which is part of a standard repertoire that "never gets old," and is expected by members of the culture that the clown society is part of.

In Native North America. [[humor]] assumes "a sacred position within ceremonials";&lt;ref&gt;Emmons, Sally L. A. (2000). ''A disarming laughter: The role of humor in tribal cultures: An examination of humor in contemporary Native American literature and art''. Ph.D Dissertation, University of Oklahoma.=&lt;/ref&gt; examples are found in [[Trickster]] traditions, [[Pueblo clown societies]], [[Cherokee]] [[Booger Dance|"Booger" dances]], and aspects of the Northwest Coast Potlatch.&lt;ref name="Johansen05"&gt;{{cite journal

==Examples==
* [[Circus clowns]] function as a clown society, in [[western culture|occidental culture]].
* [[Sacred clown]]s are called [[heyoka]] in [[Lakota people|Lakota]] Sioux [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American culture]].
* Members of the [[Clandestine Insurgent Rebel Clown Army]] combine the ancient arts of clowning and fooling with the relatively recent skills of non-violent [[direct action]].
* [[The Oxford Imps]]

==Difference from school for comedians==
A ''clown society'' is different from, but closely related to a school for [[comedian]]s. Comedians serve many of the same social functions of parody and social criticism, and also embody the role of the trickster, but a comedian usually only uses slightly exaggerated mannerisms to show that he/she is joking. Comedians who are not also clowns do not wear a blatantly outrageous or formalized costume.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Also, a ''[[comedian]]'' has to take personal responsibility for his/her humour and its consequences, whereas a person in [[clown]]-costume has some protection from reprisal.

&lt;!-- There is another difference between a "comedian" and a "comic" a comic is nearer to the traditional clown, as in the case of someone like Ken Dodd who wears loud and exaggerated costumes but still is basically a "stand-up" and manages to bridge the gap between the two different styles. --&gt;
As a general rule, a ''[[comedian]]'' says funny things, a ''[[comic]]'' does funny things, and a ''[[clown]]'' does things funny.

'''Count Smokula''' is a comedic [[fictional character]] created and portrayed by Robert "Smokey" Miles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} He has made numerous live appearances, roles in movies, TV shows and internet videos.

==Count Smokula and Smokesylvania==
As imagined by Miles, Count Smokula is a 496-year-old accordion-playing vampire with a cape and fez from the vaguely Eastern-European nation of Smokesylvania. He has been described as "Bela Lugosi-meets-Jackie Mason"&lt;ref name="NewTimes04"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2004-09-16/calendar/tongue-and-groove/|title=Tongue and Groove - Count Smokula lights up the Trunk Space|publisher=Phoenix New Times|date=September 16, 2004|accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as "a sort of Yiddish Dracula, who plays the accordion and exhibits the longest tongue this side of Gene Simmons of KISS".&lt;ref name="LATimes04"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/nov/09/local/me-only9/|title=E.T. in a Tutu? No, Thank You, the Judges Decide|publisher=latimes.com|date=November 29, 2004|last=Harvey|first=Steve|accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Count has a thick Smokesylvanian accent (he plays the "sqveezebox" and loves "to rock like you vouldn't believe it").&lt;ref name="NewTimes04"/&gt; Music is his first love and the Count Smokula Orchestra started up about 300 years ago in Glipsch, Smokesylvania where he was greatly influenced by Shnotta Shmulevitz, Smokesylvania's most famous singer.&lt;ref name="RockCity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockcitynews.com/editorial/interviews04/countsmokula.html|title=INTERVIEW June 2004 Count Smokula
|publisher=Rock City News|date=June 2004|accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he definitely doesn't suck - as he says "I gave up fangs and blood 300 years ago, my doctor told me too much cholesterol".&lt;ref name="NewTimes04"/&gt; He subscribes to a belief in Smokulism, a "voild vide" faith revealed to the Count one sleepless night in 1997 after "ingesting a rather large vegetarian pizza in the presence of the Russian Madonna". It is a way of raising ones thoughts up from the dirt and down from the clouds to live in the world as it is, and this National Belief System of Smokesylvania can be achieved by just paying $10 for a certificate to become a true Smokulist.&lt;ref name="BrooWaha"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://losangeles.broowaha.com/article.php?id=3134|title=He Likes The Night Life Since The Day That He Died|publisher=BrooWaha|date=February 19, 2008|last=Schwind|first=Gary|accessdate=2008-10-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430153236/http://losangeles.broowaha.com/article.php?id=3134|archivedate=April 30, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At an indefinite date, the Count left Smokesylvania (or rather, it left him since he tells us they moved the country stone-by-stone to the South Pacific since "the veather vas too inclement")&lt;ref name="NewTimes04"/&gt; for [[Hollywood, California]]&lt;ref name="cherry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cherrycapri.com/people_profiles.php|title=Artist Profile: Count Smokula|publisher=[[Cherry Capri]]|date=July 2, 2004|accessdate=2008-10-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215043241/http://www.cherrycapri.com/people_profiles.php|archivedate=February 15, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RockCity"/&gt; where he planned to make a fortune as a "public excess show host" so he could restore the glory of Smokesylvania.

The Count has been a longtime regular at the annual [[Doo Dah Parade]] in Pasadena, the counter-culture answer to the more staid [[Rose Parade]], where he is a familiar and often photographed figure.&lt;ref name="LATimes02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/nov/14/news/wk-rivenburg14/|title=Picking queen can be a royal pain|publisher=latimes.com|date=November 14, 2002|last=Rivenburg|first=Roy|accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HERE'S+LONG,+SHORT+OF+DOO+DAH+PARADE-a0110544036

The Count got his start in the Los Angeles underground scene, often performing at burlesque shows,&lt;ref name="NewTimes04"/&gt;  so it is not surprising{{Who|date=July 2010}} that he has a special affinity for burlesque and strippers. His relationship with the burlesque revival group, the Fishnet Floozys, has made him MC at a number of their shows in Los Angeles and Hollywood and hosting the "Count Smokula Burlesque Review".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefishnetfloozys.com/bio.htm|title=The Fishnet Floozys|publisher=thefishnetfloozys.com|accessdate=2008-10-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908010746/http://www.thefishnetfloozys.com/bio.htm|archivedate=2008-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or you might find him as MC for the "Burlesque Cabaret" at the ''Red Door Gallery'' in Phoenix,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2005-03-03/calendar/tranz-it/

Count Smokula has had a long association{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} with independent cult film producer [[Troma Entertainment|Troma Films]], creator of films such as [[The Toxic Avenger (film)|The Toxic Avenger]] and [[Blood Sucking Freaks]]. As the Count has said "When watching a Troma movie, you must not only suspend your disbelief: you must lock it up in a small iron crate and torture it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/7997

He has even ventured off to the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo]] where he was the Ringmaster of the Vamphear Circus in April 2006 featuring opera clown [[Christina Linhardt]], Hillel aka Mr. Balloonman, stilt walker and fire eater Philip Solomon and aerialist Brandy Wirtz. A highlight{{Who|date=July 2010}} of the show was his rendition of his own "Guantanamo Bay Theme Song".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnic.navy.mil/navycni/groups/public/@pub/@southe/@guantanamobay/documents/document/cnic_048381.pdf

'''''Dead Romance''''' is an original novel by [[Lawrence Miles]], originally published as part of the [[Virgin New Adventures]] series. The New Adventures were a spin-off from the long-running British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. Though part of the sequence of stories that featured the fictional archaeologist [[Bernice Summerfield]], this was released as something of a standalone, and she is not in it. The main character and narrator Christine Summerfield are not connected to her in any way. A former New Adventures [[Seventh Doctor]] companion, [[Chris Cwej]], does appear. The Seventh Doctor briefly appears as "the Evil Renegade" in Chris's tampered memories.

Almost the entirety of the book is set within a bottle universe.  This concept is most fully explored in Miles's two-book cycle ''[[Interference: Book One|Interference]]''.
(it is implied that this bottle universe is the one which appears in Interference)

Christine Summerfield reappears as Cousin Eliza in the [[Faction Paradox]] audio plays (also by Miles), voiced by Emma Kilbey.

A second edition of ''Dead Romance'' was published by [[Mad Norwegian Press]] in 2004.  This contained some minor alterations which made the book more consistent with Miles's later [[Faction Paradox]] mythos.

The novel is partly an exploration of Miles's "bottle universe" concept that places [[Virgin Publishing]]'s Virgin New Adventures series within a bottle universe inside the [[BBC Books]] [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] universe (and by extension these bottles are within a larger one containing all televised serials). This concept is most fully explored in Miles's two-book cycle ''[[Interference: Book One|Interference]]''.

This idea was never followed up on in any future novels and was abandoned, with the idea of the book series's being in bottle universes inside each other being retconed in the reprint with Lawrence Miles himself stating in a foreword to the Mad Norwegian Press edition that this was a bad idea and was rightfully ignored

The book is critically acclaimed. ''Doctor Who'' analyst Elizabeth Sandifer called it "the best Lawrence Miles novel ever. Possibly the best ''Doctor Who''-related novel ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.philipsandifer.com/2013/01/outside-government-8-dead-romance.html |title=Outside the Government 8 (Dead Romance) |work=TARDIS Eruditorum |last=Sandifer |first=Philip |date=28 January 2013 |accessdate=13 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309064554/http://www.philipsandifer.com/2013/01/outside-government-8-dead-romance.html |archivedate=9 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Directors Guild of Canada''' ('''DGC''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[trade union|labour union]], founded in 1962, which represents more than 4,800 professionals from 48 different [[profession|occupation]]s in the [[Cinema of Canada|Canadian film]] and [[List of Canadian television series|television]] industry. The DGC represents directors, editors, assistant directors, location managers, production assistants and others.

The "DGC" has district councils in the following provinces; British Columbia, Alberta, Sakatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic. However, in Quebec certain positions are represented by other unions such as IATSE 514 and the Quebec union "AQTIS". Each district council has written its own specific Standard Agreement to represent its members.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aqtis.qc.ca/en/association/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iatse514.net/en/iatse-514/mission-statement/&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Office for the Directors Guild of Canada is located on Peter Street, Toronto, Ontario.

In North American [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] [[terrestrial television]] broadcasting, a '''distributed transmission system''' ('''DTS''' or '''DTx''') is a form of [[single-frequency network]] in which a single broadcast signal is fed via [[microwave]], [[landline]], or [[communications satellite]] to multiple synchronised terrestrial [[radio transmitter]] sites. The signal is then simultaneously broadcast on the same frequency in different overlapping portions of the same coverage area, effectively combining many small transmitters to generate a [[service contour|broadcast area]] rivalling that of one large transmitter or to fill gaps in coverage due to terrain or localised obstacles.

== History ==
While the idea of a single-frequency network of multiple transmitters broadcasting the same programming on the same channel from multiple transmitter sites is not a new concept, the [[ATSC]] digital television standard in use in North America was not designed for this mode of operation and was poorly adapted to these applications. The restrictive timing requirements and poor [[multipath interference]] handling of early ATSC implementations would have precluded multiple synchronous transmitters on the same frequency at the time of the first wide-scale commercial ATSC deployment in 1998; these restrictions eased somewhat as receiver design advanced in subsequent years. By 2004, technology existed to provide digital television receivers with the means to detect static (not mobile or changing) multipath interference (subject to certain timing constraints) and compensate for its effects on the digital signal.

Tests have been run by various individual broadcasters or broadcast groups, including the [[Metropolitan Television Alliance]] (MTVA, a [[consortium]] of [[New York city]] television stations).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntia.doc.gov/otiahome/dtv/nyc911.html NTIA: NYC 9/11 Digital Television Transition Project]&lt;/ref&gt; A series of initial tests involving four distributed transmission sites and over 100 test measurement sites in NYC and New Jersey were completed in June 2008, along with smaller-scale tests in New York in 2007. The New York market is uniquely problematic for multipath reception due to the large number of man-made obstacles which prevent adequate digital coverage of the entire city from the main broadcast facilities atop the [[Empire State Building]]. (The proposed 1776-foot [[One World Trade Center|Freedom Tower]] has not yet been constructed, and the [[DTV transition in the United States|2009 US DTV transition]] has already been completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvnewsday.com/articles/2008/05/29/daily.3/ BIG STICK, BIG JOB: Finding NY's new TV home, TVNewsday, May 29 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Technical issues ==
To the receiver, a signal from a single-frequency network appears as a single broadcast with strong [[multipath interference]]; in the worst case, it is detected as a main signal and a reflection both of equal strength as signals arrive from multiple transmitters to the same intermediate location at slightly different times.

The [[ATSC]] standard used for [[digital television]] in North America, unlike the [[DVB-T]] standard in [[Europe]] and other nations, uses [[8VSB]] instead of [[OFDM]]—a [[modulation]] which allowed a station to transmit at lower peak power levels, but which historically has been far inferior in handling multipath [[reflected signal|reflection]]s and [[RF interference]].

The first widespread commercial deployment of US ATSC digital television began in 1998, with the first early adopters being stations in the largest markets (including New York city, served by transmitters atop the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]). Digital receivers of this era, while expensive, were poorly equipped to deal with reflected signals—a severe drawback in urbanised environments. Later generations of receiver design significantly mitigated these limitations; by 2004 technology existed to build receivers capable of detecting and compensating for static multipath interference conditions where a single echo was 10&amp;nbsp;dB weaker (within a 30 microsecond time difference) or the same strength (the worst case, but within a 12 microsecond range).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An ATSC DTV receiver with improved robustness to multipath and distributed transmission environments |author=Wu, Y. |author2=Xianbin Wang |author3=Citta, R. |author4=Ledoux, B. |author5=Lafleche, S. |author6=Caron, B. |journal=IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting |year=2004 |doi=10.1109/TBC.2004.823843 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the transmitters could be kept at sufficiently precise synchronisation and sufficiently close geographical spacing to operate within these limits, a single-frequency network using the new receiver design would be possible even with the existing North American ATSC digital broadcast standards.&lt;ref&gt;Design procedures and field test results of a distributed-translator network, and a case study for an application of distributed-transmission; SALEHIAN K., WU Y., CARON B.; Communications Research Centre (CRC) Ottawa, IEEE transactions on broadcasting, 2006, ISSN 0018-9316 IETBAC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tests by [[Pennsylvania State University]] public educational [[WPSX-TV]] (now WPSU-TV) were initially made in 2003&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadcastengineering.com/news/broadcasting_wpsxtv_set_begin/ WPSX-TV set to begin experimental DTX transmission, May 15, 2003 12:00 PM]&lt;/ref&gt; WPSU was in analog a [[VHF]] 3 station which serves [[State College, Pennsylvania]] from a distant transmitter which must also cover [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania|Johnstown]] and [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]]. As a digital station, WSPU had used a large [[UHF]] 15 transmitter at the location of the original [[Band I|low-VHF]] broadcast tower, leading to localised problems with [[terrain shielding]] which interfered with UHF reception in State College itself. Relocation of the main transmitter would have interfered with the station's ability to serve the other two communities. Addition of a small (50 [[kilowatt|kW]]) synchronised digital TV transmitter in State College, on the same frequency as the main UHF 15 signal, proved a means to improve reception; further improvements would be possible by adding small co-channel 50&amp;nbsp;kW transmitters in each community to be served.

ATSC released standards on September 25, 2004 as guidance on the design of multiple transmitters, single frequency networks and multiple frequency networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsc.org/communications/press/2004-09-25-new-practices.php ATSC approves new recommended practice A/111: Design of Synchronized Multiple Transmitter Networks, September 25, 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215161632/http://www.atsc.org/communications/press/2004-09-25-new-practices.php |date=December 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new 2004 standards included:
* A/110A, "Synchronization Standard for Distributed Transmission, Revision A"
* A/111, "Design of Synchronized Multiple Transmitter Networks" &lt;ref&gt;[http://broadcastengineering.com/storage_networking/atsc-distributed-transmission/index1.html ATSC distributed transmission], Broadcast Engineering, February 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical issues addressed included that of synchronization between transmitters ([[GPS]] was used to supply a 1&amp;nbsp;Hz and a 10&amp;nbsp;MHz reference frequency, as well as timing information) and precise control of transmitted frequencies (to within 1&amp;nbsp;Hz). Identification for each individual transmitter needed to be embedded in the signal for troubleshooting purposes, yet the main data stream on every synchronised transmitter must be identical; this is done by adding a second, low bit rate [[spread spectrum]] signal 27–30&amp;nbsp;dB weaker than the main signal. As this "watermark" identifier is buried under the stronger main signal, multiple repetitions of this same identifier could be received and summed in order to provide a readable version of the watermark to broadcast technicians. A standard receiver, meanwhile, would see the same signal from all transmitters by design.

The generation of non-MPEG data carried as part of the [[transport layer]] (such as the position of transmitted frame sync, or the initial state of trellis encoding devices) would also have to be matched exactly between every synchronized transmitter. Even though this data is discarded after the received signal is demodulated, any mismatch could create interference between the various co-channel signals. An extra “operations and maintenance” distributed transmission packet (OMP, packet identifier PID:0x1FFA) would need to be added to the ATSC data at the studio and used to control various parameters needed for configuration and synchronization of the individual transmitters.

The location, directional pattern and power levels for each of the transmitters would also have to be very carefully chosen, as the ATSC system is subject to very strict limits on the maximum time difference between arrival of multiple versions of the same signal at the receiver. In problem reception areas, significant improvements could be obtained but careful design would be required to operate multiple co-channel transmitters without destructive interference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axcera.com/downloads/technotes-whitepapers/hershberger_white_paper.pdf The ATSC Distributed Transmission System and Applications to Translator Service] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326011411/http://www.axcera.com/downloads/technotes-whitepapers/hershberger_white_paper.pdf |date=March 26, 2009 }}, David L.

== Regulatory issues ==
While the US [[Federal Communications Commission]] has supported DTS in principle since 2004, an FCC call for public comment at the end of 2005 garnered a wide spectrum of responses in early 2006, ranging from strong support by groups such as the [[National Association of Broadcasters]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nab.org/AM/AMTemplate.cfm?template=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=2496 National Association of Broadcasters submission to FCC, 2006, supporting DTS]&lt;/ref&gt; to widespread opposition by groups who advocate the free use of "white spaces" (unused broadcast frequencies)&lt;ref&gt;[http://gullfoss2.fcc.gov/prod/ecfs/retrieve.cgi?native_or_pdf=pdf&amp;id_document=6518333904 Opposition to DTV DTS, various organisations, as filed with FCC in 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; for non-broadcast purposes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commoncause.org/atf/cf/%7BFB3C17E2-CDD1-4DF6-92BE-BD4429893665%7D/FCC%20COMMENTS_05-312_DTS_NPRM_FINAL_010606.PDF CommonCause.org objections to DTS, FCC 2006 filing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081128080002/http://www.commoncause.org/atf/cf/%7BFB3C17E2-CDD1-4DF6-92BE-BD4429893665%7D/FCC%20COMMENTS_05-312_DTS_NPRM_FINAL_010606.PDF |date=November 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as wireless data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newamerica.net/publications/resources/2006/fcc_comments_opposition_to_digital_tv_distributed_transmission_system New America: Opposition to DTV DTS, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The FCC granted six-month special technical authority to [[WTVE]] [[Reading, Pennsylvania]] in December 2006, allowing it to operate a distributed transmission system on an experimental basis but did not authorise the systems on any permanent, licensed basis at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadcastengineering.com/RF/broadcasting_transmission_boost Transmission boost: The FCC permits a distributed transmission system, Harry C. Martin, Broadcast Engineering, Feb 1, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215101205/http://broadcastengineering.com/RF/broadcasting_transmission_boost |date=December 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An FCC-sponsored test market exercise in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] shut down all analogue full-power commercial broadcasts at noon on September 8, 2008. While a large number of the resulting calls from viewers were straightforward questions about installation of antennas and converters, or the need to scan for channels before being able to watch digital television, hundreds more were about a more intractable problem. Viewers of longtime full-power low-VHF broadcasters like [[WECT]] ([[NBC]] 6 Wilmington), a signal which in its analogue form reached to the edge of [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]], could no longer receive the station - even with the converter and proper antenna installation. The move to UHF 44 and a different transmitter site had substantially reduced WECT's coverage area&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.televisionbroadcast.com/article/72120 Confronting the Cliff Effect], Paige Albiniak, TV Broadcast, December 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and, for many who for many years were on the fringes of the analogue NBC 6 signal, WECT was no more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20081111-fcc-oks-digital-workaround-for-dtv-signal-range-problems.html FCC OKs digital workaround for DTV signal range problems, Matthew Lasar, ArsTechnica, November 11, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 2008 the FCC issued an order approving the use of distributed transmission systems by terrestrial DTV broadcasters, subject to various restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-08-256A1.pdf FCC order on distributed transmission, November 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; This allows broadcasters to apply for DTS facilities to cover the area once covered by analogue TV, while not expanding coverage beyond the existing analogue coverage area. It also prohibits a broadcaster "cherry picking" a coverage area in such a way as to cover urban areas while leaving rural viewers with no signal.

This waiver has come too late to allow the newly proposed DTS facilities to be constructed and operational before the federally mandated 2009 analogue shutoff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hometheatermag.com/news/111708fccfix/ Home Theater News: FCC Green-Lights DTV Range Fix, Mark Fleischmann, November 17, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Consumer Electronics Association]] and [[CTIA – The Wireless Association|CTIA]] proposed in December 2009 to force all stations to use this method, so that the companies they represent could use the remaining space in the [[TV band]] for [[mobile broadband]].  Unlike the [[digital television transition in the United States]], they do not propose that stations be forced to pay for it however, much like the 2&amp;nbsp;GHz [[broadcast auxiliary service]] was forced to move by the FCC, but only after the beneficiary ([[Sprint Nextel]]) compensated broadcasters for the [[regulatory taking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadcastengineering.com/news/cea-ctia-pitch-model-free-spectrum-broadcast-use-20091228/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113222532/http://broadcastengineering.com/news/cea-ctia-pitch-model-free-spectrum-broadcast-use-20091228/ |archivedate=2010-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Individual broadcasters ==
In [[Puerto Rico]], [[Spanish language]] independent [[WSTE]] 7 "Super Siete" currently operates multiple analogue transmitters on the same frequency to cover various portions of the same island; this system has shown limitations due to interference between the transmitters if all are operational simultaneously. Use of a properly synchronised digital DTS could help to reduce this interference.

In [[Pennsylvania]], independent [[WTVE]] is [[city of license|licensed]] to serve [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]] even though its primary audience is in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. A distributed transmission system now allows it to tailor its coverage area to improve coverage in areas where its signal is currently [[rimshot (broadcasting)|marginal]].

In [[Virginia]] public television [[WVPT]]/[[WVPY]] operate a combined total of five additional on-channel synchronised transmitters to fill areas blocked by mountains from two main VHF/UHF transmitters; a set of [[United States dollar|US$]]100,000 synchronised digital transmitters can replace service from the same number of conventional analogue [[broadcast translator]]s and also enable overnight [[datacasting]] of instructional materials to the area's 188 [[school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wvpt.net/pi/WVPY1%20Stamped.pdf WVPY application for experimental DTS transmitter at Luray VA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wvpt.net/pi/WVPY2%20Stamped.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New Mexico]], [[Telemundo]] affiliate [[KTDO]] proposes DTS as a means of pairing a low-power DTV facility currently operating in its [[city of license|community of license]] ([[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]]) with a second facility atop a mountain overlooking [[El Paso, Texas]] in order to reach a wider audience.&lt;ref&gt;http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1232496&amp;Service=TV&amp;Form_id=387&amp;Facility_id=36916&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Missouri]], FOX affiliate [[KRBK]] operates a DTS as a way to service the Springfield, Missouri market from 5 transmission points based around the Springfield DMA.  This system went on air in late 2011, and is still being revised today.

In [[Alaska]], Anchorage MyTV affiliate [[KYES-TV]] operates with limited resources and equipment, covering a large and sparsely populated area with many small [[broadcast translator]] stations. While broadcast signal synchronization is not an issue (as the overlap between signals falls entirely into unpopulated areas), the ability to re-use multiple small transmitters may allow the station to avoid the cost of building one large, expensive main transmitter for its digital signal.

'''''Dragon Age: Origins''''' is a [[role-playing game]] developed by [[BioWare]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. It is the first game in the ''[[Dragon Age]]'' franchise, and was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]] in November 2009, and for [[Mac OS X]] in December 2009. Set in the fictional kingdom of Ferelden during a period of civil strife, the game puts the player in the role of a [[Warrior (character class)|warrior]], [[Wizard (character class)|mage]], or [[Thief (character class)|rogue]] coming from an [[Elves in fantasy fiction and games#Elves in games|elven]], [[human]], or [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarven]] background. The player character is recruited into the Grey Wardens, an ancient order that stands against demonic forces known as "Darkspawn", and is tasked with defeating the Archdemon that commands them and ending their invasion. The game is played from a [[third-person perspective]] that can be shifted to a [[top-down perspective]]. Throughout the game, players encounter various companions, who play major roles in the game's plot and gameplay.

BioWare described ''Dragon Age: Origins'' as a "dark [[heroic fantasy]]" set in a unique world, and a [[spiritual successor]] to their previous ''[[Baldur's Gate]]'' and ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' franchises. Its setting was inspired by ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[A Song of Ice &amp; Fire]]'', and was described by BioWare as a mix between [[high fantasy]] and [[low fantasy]]. Development of the game began in 2002 and BioWare employed more than 144 voice-actors, and hired [[Inon Zur]] to compose the game's music. The development of the game's console versions was outsourced to [[Edge of Reality]].

''Origins'' received critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its story, setting, [[Characters of Dragon Age|characters]], music and combat system. It sold more than 3.2 million copies and 1 million pieces of [[downloadable content]]. Its multiple year-end accolades included [[Game of the Year]] and Best Role-playing awards from several gaming publications. BioWare released several instances of downloadable content after the game's initial launch, an [[expansion pack]] for the game titled ''[[Dragon Age: Origins – Awakening|Awakening]]'' in March 2010, and two sequels, ''[[Dragon Age II]]'' and ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'', were released in 2011 and 2014 respectively.

==Gameplay==
''Dragon Age: Origins'' is a [[role-playing game]]. The player is a Grey Warden, part of an order of elite fighters, whose task is to defeat the [[Characters of Dragon Age|Archdemon]] and save the world from a disastrous event called the Blight. Players create their own Grey Warden character, customizing gender and appearance as well as choosing a race and class.&lt;ref name="IGNRev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/11/04/dragon-age-origins-review|title=Dragon Age: Origins Review|first=Jeff|last=Haynes|date=November 3, 2009|accessdate=September 25, 2015|work=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The available classes are warriors, who perform strong physical attacks; rogues, who carry out [[stealth game|stealth]] attacks and steal items from other characters; and mages, who cast [[magic (gaming)|spells]] on enemies, create [[combo (gaming)|combo spells]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5250623/dragon-age-origins-preview-violence-lust-and-betrayal|title=Dragon Age: Origins Preview: Violence, Lust and Betrayal|first=Brian|last=Crecente|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=September 12, 2009|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and support other party members.&lt;ref name="Destruct"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/preview-dragon-age-origins-146906.phtml|title=Preview: Dragon Age: Origins|first=Jim|last=Sterling|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=September 4, 2015
|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three choices of race are human, elf, and dwarf. The combination of class and race determines which of six different origin stories the player experiences: Dalish Elf, Dwarf Commoner, City Elf, Mage, Human Noble, or Dwarf Noble.&lt;ref name="originstories"/&gt; This affects the way other in-game characters perceive the player's character; for instance, a Dwarven Commoner would receive hatred and discrimination from other dwarves.&lt;ref name="originstories"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/02/12/bioware-reveals-all-six-dragon-age-origin-stories|title=BioWare Reveals Six Dragon Age Origin Stories|work=[[IGN]]|date=February 12, 2009|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all classes follow the same plot after the completion of the origin story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/dragon-age-origins-review|title=Dragon Age: Origins review|first=Oli|last=Welsh|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=November 23, 2009|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During gameplay, the player encounters a variety of enemies, including giant spiders, darkspawn, ghosts, walking trees, and dragons.&lt;ref name="GSpot1"/&gt; They also recruit companions, who accompany them and provide assistance in battle. These companions are normally controlled by [[artificial intelligence]], with behaviour that the player can adjust through the "Tactics" menu, but the player also has the option to switch between characters and is able to issue orders to them in real-time or pause the game to queue up actions.&lt;ref name="GSpot1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-origins-review/1900-6238631/|title=Dragon Age Origins review|first=Kevin|last=VanOrd|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=November 3, 2009|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cvg&gt;{{cite web | last=Porter| first=Will | date=April 6, 2007 | url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=160943 | title=Will Porter chases the dragon.

Using a [[third-person perspective]], the combat in ''Origins'' is largely similar to BioWare's previous game, ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''. The player and any companions in their party engage in combat with the weapons they have equipped when the player targets or is noticed by a hostile enemy. Players can swap weapons and perform special attacks during combat, but most of these attacks have a recharge time.&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt; The point of view can be shifted from the third person view to a [[top-down view]], where friendly and hostile units are labelled with different colours to distinguish them.&lt;ref name="Shack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/57979/dragon-age-origins-preview-unicorn|title=Dragon Age Origins Preview: Unicorn Dreams|first=Nick|last=Breckon|work=[[Shacknews]]|date=April 1, 2009|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of a battle the characters' [[health (gaming)|health]] and stamina, which powers a character's skills, are automatically refilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/116872/Critical_Reception_EABioWares_Dragon_Age_Origins.php|title=Critical Reception: EA/BioWare's Dragon Age: Origins|first=Danny|last=Cowan|work=[[Gamasutra]]|date=November 4, 2009|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an enemy is defeated, the player collects any items or loot from its corpse.&lt;ref name="GSpot1"/&gt;

The player can [[level (role-playing games)|level up]] their Warden character by earning [[experience (gaming)|experience points]] through completing quests and defeating enemies. Each time the player levels up, they receive three points to spend on the character's six attributes. Strength inflicts more damage, dexterity helps evade attacks more often, willpower increases stamina, magic increases spell damage or magic defence, cunning improves combat tactics, and constitution helps withstand attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/08/10/dragon-age-origins-human-noble-hands-on|title=Dragon Age: Origins Human Noble Hands-On|first=Jason|last=Ocampo|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 16, 2009|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special skills, which are divided into four different aspects for each class, and specialization options, which offer class-specific skills, can also be unlocked by levelling up.&lt;ref name="RPG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/other/pc/dragonage/dragonageimp5.html|title=Dragon Age Origins: PC Hands-On Impression|first=Tom|last=Goldman|work=RPGamer|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The player can talk and interact with both party members and other [[non-playable characters]].

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
The game is set in Ferelden, one of several countries in the fictional world of Thedas. Demonic creatures called the Darkspawn dwell within the Deep Roads, an underground highway system created by the dwarves long ago, deep beneath the surface of Thedas. Every few hundred years, the Darkspawn swarm the surface world in a movement known as a Blight. Ever since the first Blight, Thedas has relied on the legendary order of warriors known as the Grey Wardens to drive the Darkspawn back. ''Dragon Age: Origins'' begins on the eve of Thedas's fifth Blight.

Thedas is a world in which race and class combine to determine social class. Elves are often viewed as second-class citizens by humans, while human nobles are treated with respect. Mages, on the other hand, are cloistered by the Chantry: they have access to the Fade, the unconscious realm that is the home of spirits, and a single lapse in vigilance could cause them to be possessed by demons. Apostate mages, who live outside the Chantry's control, are considered extremely dangerous, and the Chantry has a militant wing, the Templars, to seek them out and subdue them by any means necessary. Dwarves live in the Deep Roads, their kingdom a shadow of what it once was before the first Blight. Their society is rooted in tradition and a rigid caste system.

===Characters===
{{Main|Characters of Dragon Age}}
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Protagonists in Dragon Age Origins.jpg|thumb|right|''Dragon Age: Origins'' protagonists. From left to right: Oghren, Leliana, Morrigan, Sten, The Grey Warden (the player character), Mabari War Hound, [[Alistair (Dragon Age)|Alistair]], Wynne, Zevran and Shale]] --&gt;

The chief protagonist of ''Dragon Age: Origins'' is the player-controlled character, whose biography and combat specialization are determined by the race and class chosen at the start of the game. While the player can choose his or her avatar's first name, the character is usually referred to as "The Warden" by other characters and the game's narration.

Many of the game's [[non-player character]]s (NPCs) are companion characters, who appear throughout the game and may volunteer their services. Companions include Alistair, a reluctantly heroic Grey Warden with a sarcastic wit; Morrigan, a sultry but cynical dark mage who has little regard for authority or social mores; Leliana, an ex-member of Ferelden's Chantry whose optimistic and virtuous demeanor belies an aptitude for espionage and combat; Sten, a proud but stoic warrior of the militaristic Qunari people who often questions human ways; Oghren, a brutal dwarven warrior whose love of alcohol is only matched by his penchant for violence and loyalty to his friends; Wynne, an Elder Mage of the Circle, a maternal figure to the party and a powerful healer; Zevran, a rakish elven assassin who is fond of treasures, sex and innuendo; and a loyal Mabari War Hound, which the player can name and use for scouting and combat. In the DLC, Shale, a sarcastic Golem with a mild [[ornithophobia]] who was a female dwarf in her prior life, is also available.

Outside of companion characters, NPCs significant to the ''Origins'' plot include Duncan, the Grey Warden who recruits the player; King Cailan, Ferelden's naive but courageous leader and son of the legendary King Maric; Queen Anora, Cailan's young, politically-savvy wife, with a commanding personality that is somewhat offset by her ambition and ruthlessness; and Flemeth, Morrigan's mother, who appears to be a harmless old woman, but in truth is an infamous dark witch of Fereldan legend.

The faceless Darkspawn horde is led by the Archdemon Urthemiel, supposedly one of the Old Gods of the Tevinter Imperium incarnated in the form of a powerful and corrupted dragon with total control over the darkspawn. The game's other main antagonists are Teyrn Loghain Mac Tir, father of Queen Anora, a once-respected war hero gone mad with ambition and paranoia; and Rendon Howe, the amoral and corrupt Arl of Amaranthine who allies with Loghain to further his own ambitions. Loghain can be recruited as a "secret companion," but doing so will cause Alistair to leave the Warden.

===Plot===
One of six predetermined origin stories begins the game, depending on the [[player character]]'s race and class. Each story ends with the player leaving with Duncan, the commander of Ferelden's Grey Wardens who, seeking new recruits, selects the player as a potential candidate. The two journey to Ferelden's southern fortress, Ostagar, to join Cailan, the King of Ferelden, and his father-in-law Loghain, a legendary general. The three leaders plan to attack the encroaching Darkspawn to stop a new Blight from overwhelming Ferelden. Duncan senses the influence of an Archdemon, a god-like Dragon that commands the Darkspawn, which makes this the first true Blight in over 400 years. Duncan emphasizes the importance of defeating the Blight before it can gain enough momentum to threaten the rest of Thedas.

Duncan initiates the player into the Grey Wardens via a dangerous ritual called the Joining, which involves imbibing Darkspawn blood. The recipient, if they survive, is granted the powerful Darkspawn essence, the Taint, which gives them a rudimentary connection into their [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]] to sense them. After surviving, the player (now nicknamed "The Warden") and fellow Grey Warden, Alistair, are tasked with lighting a beacon at the top of the fortress to signal Loghain's men into charging the Darkspawn horde flank. However, upon arriving, Loghain abandons the battlefield, leaving Cailan, Duncan, and their army to be slain by the Darkspawn, who seize control of Ostagar and begin advancing into southern Ferelden.

The Warden and Alistair are saved by Flemeth, a powerful witch who lives in a secluded hermitage. Flemeth sends her daughter and apprentice, Morrigan, to accompany the Warden and Alistair in gathering a new army to combat the Archdemon and stop the Blight. Using ancient Grey Warden treaties, the Warden travels across Ferelden to enlist the aid of the Circle of Magi, the Dalish Elves, the Dwarves of Orzammar, and soldiers in Redcliffe loyal to Arl Eamon. In addition, Alistair reveals that he is a bastard son of King Maric Theirin, Cailan's father, making him a contender for the now vacant throne.

Meanwhile, Loghain returns to Ferelden's capital city, Denerim, to inform his daughter, Queen Anora, of Cailan's death. Loghain [[scapegoat]]s the Grey Wardens for the defeat at Ostagar and demands the deaths of any survivors. While Anora inherits her husband's authority, Loghain quickly declares himself her regent and effectively seizes control of the kingdom, swiftly becoming a brutal and tyrannical ruler determined to retain power. Ferelden's nobility rebel against him, igniting a [[civil war]]. This ends in an inconclusive stalemate, allowing the Darkspawn to advance further into Ferelden unopposed.

Eamon then calls a Landsmeet among the nobles of Ferelden to rally the kingdom against the Darkspawn, where the Warden or a party member defeats Loghain in a duel. If Alistair defeats Loghain, he will then execute him. Otherwise, the Warden can either have Loghain executed or initiated into the Grey Wardens (which causes Alistair to quit the party and the Wardens). Dependent on this and other past decisions, the Warden then settles who assumes Ferelden's throne (Alistair and/or Anora), with the option of marrying the one of opposite gender if a Human Noble.

The night before the final battle, the Warden learns that a Grey Warden must slay the Archdemon to prevent it from releasing a demonic essence which finds a new host in the nearest Darkspawn. The essence will be drawn to the Taint, killing the Warden in the process. Morrigan then meets with the Warden and proposes a ritual that will see her conceive a child with a Warden. The Archdemon, upon death, will instead be drawn to the child, born as a demigod with the Taint, sparing the Warden who slays it. Morrigan agrees to conceive the child on the condition that she be allowed to raise it alone. The Warden can accept Morrigan's offer (if male), convince Alistair/Loghain to take part instead, or refuse the proposal (which causes Morrigan to leave the party).

The next day, the Warden and the newly assembled army of Ferelden gather in Denerim. They repel the Darkspawn horde and finally conquer the Archdemon atop Denerim's highest tower. If the ritual with Morrigan was performed, the Warden slays the Archdemon. If not, they must decide whether they or Alistair/Loghain does so and perishes in the process. The remaining Darkspawn retreat from Denerim, marking the end of the Fifth Blight. The story ends with a ceremony attended by Ferelden citizens, where the Warden and their companions are honoured for saving the kingdom. Lastly, a slideshow epilogue details the ramifications of the Warden's choices, including the future of Ferelden, any rumours, and the fates of his or her companions.

[[David Gaider]], the lead writer for ''Origins'', built the game's world first before writing the plot. The team chose a "fantasy" setting because Dan Tudge, the game's director, thought that BioWare was at its best in the fantasy genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/dragon-age-origins-interview?page=2|title=Dragon Age: Origins: Page 2|first=Robert|work=[[Eurogamer]]|last=Purchese|date=August 20, 2008|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first draft, there were no Darkspawn or Grey Wardens, and mages were not allowed to use magic in cities. There were twelve different origin stories, including Human Commoner and Avvar, a barbarian origin. However, most of them were scrapped for being "ridiculous", leading to six stories being finalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-06-30-the-first-draft-of-dragon-age-origins-didnt-even-have-grey-wardens|title=The first draft of Dragon Age: Origins didn't even have Grey Wardens|first=Robert|last=Purchese|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=June 30, 2015|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loghain was the first character to be created, while an Ogre, nicknamed "Fluffy", and a human with medium armour were the first enemies designed.&lt;ref name="Stat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/02/25/news-tidbits-dragon-age-origins.aspx|title=What You Didn't Know About Dragon Age: Origins|first=Andrew|last=Reiner|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=February 25, 2010|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of Alistair and Morrigan were the next to be created, as they play the largest role in the game's plot. Their creation also took far longer than other characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.ca/syn/60/65703/65703|title=History of Dragon Age with Bioware Lead Writer David Gaider- Dragon Age: Origins "You Won’t BELIEVE What We Cut!"|first=Andy|last=Borkowski|date=June 26, 2015|accessdate=September 26, 2015|work=[[CFNY-FM|102.1 The Edge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrigan was originally conceived to be similar to Flemeth, speaking whimsically. However, Gaider was not satisfied and decided to completely rewrite her personality. As a result, she was designed as a "blunt" person who always resists her mother. Finding a suitable voice actor for Morrigan took the most time of any character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/08/12/dragon-age-inquisition-s-morrigan-past-and-present.aspx|title=Dragon Age: Inquisition’s Morrigan – Past and Present|first=Kimberly|last=Wallace|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=August 12, 2013|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's final version features 68,260 lines of dialogue; the [[quality assurance]] testers for the game enabled a cheat to automatically skip these cutscenes and dialogues during test runs.&lt;ref name="Stat"/&gt;

[[Ray Muzyka]], co-founder of BioWare, said that the team wanted to try something that would be new but familiar to most players.&lt;ref name="BioWareE32004"/&gt; They hoped that ''Origins'' would redefine the genre to become ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' of video game franchises. [[Greg Zeschuk]], another co-founder of BioWare, described the fantasy of ''Dragon Age'' as in between the [[high fantasy]] of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s works and the [[low fantasy]] of works by [[George R.R. Martin]]. The goal was a "dark heroic fantasy" that would suit the taste of any fan of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/04/07/biowares-founders-envision-dragon-age-origins-as-dark-heroic-fantasy-universe/|title=BioWare’s founders envision Dragon Age: Origins as dark heroic fantasy universe|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|date=April 7, 2009|accessdate=September 26, 2015|work=[[VentureBeat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while the game has the typical races of human, elf, and dwarf, they are slightly altered from the usual nature of the three races, and a new lizard-like race called the Qunari was introduced.&lt;ref name="E304"/&gt; Some of the alterations they made included flipping how certain races, like elves, are treated in other fictional worlds. While elves are often described as a race of high prestige in fiction, ''Dragon Age: Origins'' presents them as slaves of humans, labelled as second-class citizens who resent the human race. This extended to the gameplay, where the player can choose to [[racism|discriminate]] against other races and can experience discrimination from others based on their choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5186500/bioware-tackles-elf-racism-in-dragon-age-origins|title=BioWare Tackles Elf Racism In Dragon Age: Origins|first=AJ|last=Glasser|date=March 27, 2015|accessdate=September 26, 2015|work=[[Kotaku]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote=We don't constrain what they do. We don't strive for gratuitous content. But we also ask the teams to choose a direction and then run with it. That was their choice. That's how they wanted to depict the romantic liaisons in the game, so that's what we did.|source = —[[Ray Muzyka]], founder of BioWare, on the romance system of ''Dragon Age: Origins''|width=33%}}

BioWare recognized that non-linear choices are an element unique to video games in the entertainment industry. Zeschuk called the sheer number of choices in the game "big" and "impactful", and the team designed many of those to be emotional and create a more personal experience for the player.&lt;ref name="MultiplayerBlog"/&gt; They intentionally avoided adding a [[karma|karma system]], as the choices are designed to be ambiguous, with only the player to judge whether they are good or bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primagames.com/games/dragon-age-origins/strategy/dragon-age-origins-lead-designer-interview|title=Dragon Age: Origins lead designer interview|first=Dan|last=Page|work=[[Prima Games]]|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Muzyka, their goal was to make players sympathize with events and characters, connecting with them to feel true emotions. This vision challenged the team to balance many key aspects, such as the amount of dialogue and animation in each cutscene, to create a believable scenario for players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/pc/dragon_age/news/muzyka_dragon_age_and_me_2_will_make_gamers_cry.html|title=Muzyka: Dragon Age and ME 2 will make gamers cry|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=VideoGamer.com|date=September 10, 2009|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team also hoped to handle romance in a more "mature" and "complicated" way, with a true reflection on human relationships and reactions rather than "adolescent titillation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/dragon_age/preview-1831.html|title=Dragon Age: Origins Preview|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=VideoGamer.com|date=July 10, 2009|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has sex scenes, but no nudity. Muzyka added that it was an artistic choice and a decision made by the team, not the publisher Electronic Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/96134-Lack-Of-Nudity-in-Dragon-Age-Was-Designers-Call|title=Lack Of Nudity in Dragon Age Was Designer's Call|first=Greg|last=Tito|work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|date=November 17, 2015|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''Origins'' is a [[single-player]]-only game, Muzyka described it as a "social experience", considering the narrative and its variety of paths as an integral part of the gameplay. The characters a player meets, items they collect, and quests they receive and complete may be different, leading to a completely different experience. He also considered the ways a player explores the world and discovers new areas as an exploration narrative. As each player had a different experience, they hoped that those players would collaborate to expand upon their knowledge of the world. To that effect, the team built a community site as an online social environment for players to communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4120/an_age_to_come_ray_muzyka_on_.php?print=1|title=An Age To Come: Ray Muzyka On BioWare's Dragon Age|first=Chris|last=Remo|work=[[Gamasutra]]|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players could share stats and automatically generated screenshots with the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5390868/bioware-reveals-dragon-ages-massively-single-player-details|title=BioWare Reveals Dragon Age's "Massively Single-Player" Details|first=Stephen|last=Totilo|date=October 27, 2009|accessdate=September 26, 2015|work=[[Kotaku]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sound===
The game features an [[orchestra]]l soundtrack with a [[choir]], used both in-game and during cutscenes. The soundtrack was recorded by the performance of a 44-piece orchestra, recorded twice and merged to sound like an 88-piece orchestra.&lt;ref name="Stat"/&gt; It was composed by [[Inon Zur]] and performed by the [[Northwest Sinfonia]].&lt;ref name="Stat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ea.com/news/dragon-age-origins-soundtrack-composed-by-inon-zur|title=Dragon Age: Origins soundtrack composed by Inon Zur|date=September 24, 2009|publisher=Electronic Arts|accessdate=December 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zur, he intentionally made most of the soundtrack feel "dark", combining low [[brass instrument|brass]] and bass string instruments with ancient [[drum]]s to express a feeling that is both heroic and demonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gNOEBEcTCU|title=Sound Byte Interview: Dragon Age II Composer Inon Zur (PC, PS3, Xbox 360)|work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=March 8, 2011|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the tracks, "Leliana's Song", was composed in under 24 hours.&lt;ref name="Stat"/&gt; The soundtrack was presented at a panel in the Hollywood Music in Media Interactive Conference in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/102/1028186p1.html|title=BioWare's Dragon Age: Origins Soundtrack Composed by Award-Winning Inon Zur|date=September 24, 2009|publisher=IGN|accessdate=December 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was performed as part of the September 26 "A Night in Fantasia 2009" concert in [[Sydney]], Australia, by the [[Eminence Symphony Orchestra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.ea.com/portal/site/ea/template.PAGE/menuitem.be8f8aafa1f7201d1abbba10f6908a0c/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20090924005113&amp;newsLang=en |title=BioWare's Dragon Age: Origins Original Orchestral Soundtrack Composed by Award-Winning Inon Zur |publisher=[[Electronic Arts]] |date=September 24, 2009 |accessdate=March 14, 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302073004/http://news.ea.com/portal/site/ea/template.PAGE/menuitem.be8f8aafa1f7201d1abbba10f6908a0c/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20090924005113&amp;newsLang=en |archivedate=March 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Origins'' contains a large amount of voice acting recorded in the US and the UK. Actors include [[Tim Russ]], [[Steve Valentine]], [[Kate Mulgrew]], [[Simon Templeman]], [[Mark Rolston]], [[Tim Curry]], [[Adam Howden]], [[Nicola Bertram]], and [[Claudia Black]].&lt;ref name="voiceact"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worthplaying.com/event/E3/Post_E3_2009/62758/|title=BioWare's Dragon Age: Origins To Feature the Voices of Tim Curry and Kate Mulgrew|accessdate=12 September 2016| publisher=Worthplaying.com| year=2009| last=Carolipio |first=Reggie|work=Post E3 2009 Dragon Age: Origins}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, more than 140 voice actors worked on the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/05/02/dragon-age-origins-voice-over-cast-144-strong/|title=Dragon Age: Origins voice-over cast 144-strong|first=Randy|last=Nelson|work=[[Joystiq]]|date=March 2, 2009|accessdate=September 26, 2015|publisher=[[Engadget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of these recordings became the ambient dialogue that takes place between non-player characters in the adventuring party, adding to their backstories and lending more credibility to the characters.

==Release==
While the game was originally intended for PC, a console version was announced in 2008 by gaming magazine ''[[Game Informer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/10/16/dragon-age-to-consoles|title=Dragon Age To Consoles|work=[[IGN]]|first=Hilary|last=Goldstein|date=October 16, 2008|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the announcement, Zeschuk suggested that the entire franchise has a "console future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/dragon-age-franchise-has-console-future|title=Dragon Age franchise has "console future"|first=Robert|last=Purchese|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=August 5, 2008|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was made to bring the game to consoles to introduce it to a wider audience.&lt;ref name="Arc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/08/dragon-age-origins-flying-onto-consoles/|title=Dragon Age: Origins flying onto consoles|first=Andrew|last=Webster|work=[[Ars Technica]]|date=August 19, 2008|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Laidlaw, the game's lead designer, considered creating the console versions' interface a challenge, as they had to convert the long and complex quickbar from the PC version to a more streamlined interface that could use the same actions with only few button presses. To that end, the team decided to map six different actions together, and allow players to customize the arrangement.&lt;ref name="Console"/&gt; Also, the console version does not allow the top-down view possible in the PC version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5382781/only-pc-dragon-age-has-baldurs-gate-camera|title=Only PC Dragon Age Has Baldur's Gate Camera|first=Stephen|last=Totilo|work=[[Kotaku]]|date=October 15, 2009|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was originally set to be released in early 2009 for [[Microsoft Windows]], and later for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]].

''Dragon Age: Origins'' received critical acclaim from major video game critics upon its release. While the game is considered to be virtually identical across all platforms, differences in user interface, graphical performance, and online content delivery have led the PC version to be reviewed more favorably than the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions; [[Metacritic]] ranks the PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 versions of the game with scores of 91, 87, and 86, respectively.&lt;ref name="DA:OPCMecRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DA:OPS3CMecRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DA:OX360CMecRev"/&gt;

The game's setting was well received by critics. Dave Snider from [[Giant Bomb]] thought that the setting felt traditional due to the presence of dwarves and elves, but that the world was beautifully executed. He also appreciated the small touches BioWare added to the world, noting the "French-tinged accent" of the Orlesian Empire humans. He added that the six origin stories and their unique dialogue and referencing throughout the game make the world feel cohesive.&lt;ref name="GBRev"/&gt; Kevin VanOrd from [[GameSpot]] made similar comments, stating that the new ideas added to a familiar world make it feel original and new.&lt;ref name="GSpot1"/&gt; However, Jeff Haynes from [[IGN]] said that the origin stories were inconsistent, with missteps that make the world, while "rich and vivid", feel less believable.&lt;ref name="IGNRev"/&gt; Joe Juba from ''[[Game Informer]]'' wrote that the world was well-realized with a deep history, which makes the game addicting, as players can sense their Warden's importance in the world.&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt;

The game's story and characters also received praise. Snider said that the story is driven by the characters and that the choices presented in the game were difficult, making him regret some choices for weeks after completing the game. He added that the game's main quest was well written, and its quality boosted by excellent voice acting; he called the performance of Claudia Black as Morrigan one of the best in the game.&lt;ref name="GBRev"/&gt; VanOrd commended the game's story, saying that it was memorable and crafted with care, successfully making players care about the game's world and characters. He added that the deep character development made every choice "momentous".&lt;ref name="GSpot1"/&gt; [[GamesRadar]] thought that the story and the Warden's appearance felt generic, but that the story became more and more engrossing as it progressed.&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; Nick Tan from [[Game Revolution]] liked the banter between companions as a humorous change of pace within the game.&lt;ref name="GamerRevRev"/&gt; Gerald Villoria from [[GameSpy]] praised the exclusion of the moral system for making the characters feel more complex.&lt;ref name="GSpyRev"/&gt; Juba wrote that the story was good but predictable, not straying far from standard fantasy stories.&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; Wesley Yin-Poole from VideoGamer.com called the story memorable, saying that it "leaves an itch in your mind", and has attracted players to return to the game "like an addict seeking a hit of relief."&lt;ref name="VGRev"/&gt;

As for the game's combat, Snider called it streamlined but said that players who do not want to use the pause mechanic would not be able to appreciate the game, as the combat requires both patience and strategy. He liked the game's third-person view more than the top-down view, saying that being able to view the sky made environments feel more complicated, and praised the high difficulty of boss battles, which task players to manage their stamina carefully. His conclusion was that ''Origins'' "feels like a real throwback to the good old days of PC role-playing epics."&lt;ref name="GBRev"/&gt; VanOrd said that the combat system was easily recognizable for players who have played other RPGs developed by BioWare. He added that players can have a lot of fun switching between characters, and agreed that the game had created thrilling boss battles. He praised the choice to have health and stamina replenish immediately after battles, as it sped up combat pace and flow.&lt;ref name="GSpot1"/&gt; Tan also commended the combat, finding it a better system than other BioWare RPGs, but disliked the fact that characters can't step into water.&lt;ref name="GamerRevRev"/&gt; Juba praised the amount of space for players to experiment with new skills and abilities, adding that the required focus and attention make combat very satisfying.&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt;

The game's graphics received mixed reviews. VanOrd was not impressed, stating that the environments do not look as good viewed from a top-down perspective, but he praised the art style and some of the game's "eye-catching" landmarks.&lt;ref name="GSpot1"/&gt; Tan liked that the environments were varied and unique, saying that each level felt "vast" and filled with details.&lt;ref name="GamerRevRev"/&gt; Villoria found its visual quality lacking when compared with that of ''Mass Effect 2'', adding that the facial animation can feel wooden at times. However, he found the combat animation rewarding and satisfying. He further criticized the sex sequences as "off-putting".&lt;ref name="GSpyRev"/&gt; Yin-Poole said that the game's graphics were boring and generic, and called the sex scenes "anti-climatic" and poorly-executed.&lt;ref name="VGRev"/&gt; Both Villoria and Yin-Poole felt that the six-year development time was too long, considering the game's mediocre graphics.&lt;ref name="GSpyRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VGRev"/&gt;

GamesRadar estimated that there are more than 80 hours of content available in the game.&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; Villoria called the world engaging, and its replay value very high, as players can play the story over and over again with a different origin.&lt;ref name="GSpyRev"/&gt; Juba agreed,&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; as did Yin-Poole, who added that the way companions react to the player's decisions, as well as the six origin stories, significantly expand the game's longevity.&lt;ref name="VGRev"/&gt;

{{more plot|date=September 2015}}
The film starts out in front of a prison with two kids waiting for their father to be released. 15 months earlier the kids of small-time crook Jack Charles ([[Patrick Swayze]]) are put in a corrupt state-run home called Bigelow Hall when their mother dies of cancer. Jack's 18-year-old teenage daughter Kelly ([[Sabrina Lloyd]]) escapes Bigelow by breaking a window and fleeing in the night, and convinces Jack to pick up her 10-year-old younger brother Eddie ([[Brian Bonsall]]). While at a custody hearing, Jack realizes what's going on by seeing a line of kids handcuffed and chained together in a line, and decides to break Eddie out of Bigelow. First Jack tries to dump them with his mother in [[Las Vegas]], but she is a gambler and a cheat, so the cops are after her, too. His mother later reminds him that they are his kids and that they're his responsibility. After leaving they go to the [[Hoover Dam]], at Eddie's request, but the police soon arrive. As the police approach the kids, Jack drives his empty car off a cliff, to cause a distraction and plan an escape. He takes the kids to [[New Orleans]] with him, where he plans to pull off a big heist that could set them up for life.

The '''French Theater of Gustav III''' was a [[French language]] theater active in Sweden between 1781 and 1792. The French theater company performed both before the Swedish royal court in the theaters of the royal palaces, as well as before the Swedish public in [[Stockholm]]. It is known to have played a significant part in the education of the pioneer generation of actors at the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]].

The French theater was composed in Paris by [[Jacques Marie Boutet de Monvel]] in 1781, when it was engaged by king [[Gustav III of Sweden]] to perform before the Swedish royal court. Initially, they performed exclusively for the royal court in the theaters of the royal residences, such as [[Drottningholm Palace Theatre]] and [[Confidencen]].

From 1783 onward, they also performed before the Swedish public at [[Bollhuset]]. The public performances were, in practice, normally visited exclusively by the upper classes of Stockholm, who were able to understand the French language. The French Theater appeared before the public at Bollhuset on Wednesdays and Fridays, and at the royal court whenever they were commanded to. The company were considered of high quality, and performed the latest plays from Paris.

They shared Bollhuset with the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]] from 1788, but they performed separately and referred to as the "French Theater" and the "Swedish Theater" respectively. The actors of the French Theater were expected by the king to educate Swedish pupils, and many of the first generation of Swedish actors at the Royal Dramatic Theatre were students of the actors at the French Theater, such as [[Lars Hjortsberg]] and [[Fredrica Löf]].

The French Theater were dissolved after the death of Gustav III in 1792.

'''Gabriel Astruc''' (14 March 1864 – 7 July 1938) was a French journalist, agent, promoter, theatre manager, theatrical impresario, and playwright whose career connects many of the best-known incidents and personalities of [[Belle Epoque]] Paris.

== Biography ==

Born in Bordeaux, Astruc was the son of Élie Aristide Astruc (1831–1905), a rabbi (Grand Rabbi of Belgium from 1866–1879), and began his career working for publisher Paul Ollendorff, and as a columnist from 1885 through 1895.  As a regular at [[Montmartre]]'s prototypically bohemian [[Le Chat Noir]] cabaret, he befriended a young [[Erik Satie]] and wrote articles and theater pieces under the pen name ''Surtac''.&lt;ref&gt;Satie the bohemian: from cabaret to concert hall By Steven Moore Whiting&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1897 he founded a music publishing company with his father-in-law Wilhelm Enoch, by 1900 he had introduced the luxury magazine ''Musica'', and by 1904 had become a concert promoter.

In this period he was the booking agent for [[Mata Hari]].  Astruc booked Hari into the [[Paris Olympia]] in August 1905, and would manage her appearances for the next ten years, through the height of her considerable fame.  He also served as booking agent for [[Feodor Chaliapin]], [[Arthur Rubinstein]], and [[Wanda Landowska]], but not [[Isadora Duncan]], whom he considered too subtle to attract a sizable audience.&lt;ref&gt;Sisters of Salome By Toni Bentley page 104&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1905 through 1912 Astruc brought a long list of musical giants to Paris under the banner "Great Season of Paris", including an Italian season with [[Enrico Caruso]] and Australian soprano [[Nellie Melba]] in 1905, the creation of ''Salome'' under the baton of [[Richard Strauss]] in 1907, the [[Ballets Russes]] of [[Diaghilev]] in 1909, the Metropolitan Opera conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]] in 1910, and Debussy's ''[[Le martyre de Saint Sébastien]]'' (text by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]]) in 1911.

In 1913 Astruc tried to parlay his success by commissioning [[Auguste Perret]] to build the innovative [[Théâtre des Champs-Élysées]] in the Avenue Montaige. This building is an architectural landmark of early [[reinforced concrete]].  After a brilliant and scandalous first season, climaxed by the famous riot at the May 29 premiere of [[The Rite of Spring]], Astruc found himself financially ruined within six months.  He was also the target of anti-Semitic attacks from [[Léon Daudet]] and others of the [[Action Française]].&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein: a life By Harvey Sachs, Donald Manildi, page 72&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War I, he worked in the field of radio and advertising, and in 1929 served as the manager of the [[Théâtre Pigalle]] for [[Philippe de Rothschild]].  Astruc and [[Marcel Proust]] were friends, having helped proofread the first edition of [[Swann's Way]],&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Proust: A Life By William C. Carter, pg. 559&lt;/ref&gt; and Proust returned the favor by helping Astruc prepare his memoirs, ''Le pavillon des fantômes'', appearing in 1929.

His papers reside at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts Dance Collection.

'''[[Iraq]]''' first participated at the '''[[Olympic Games]]''' in 1948. Iraqis missed the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]] and boycotted the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 games]] over opposition to the [[Suez Crisis]]. Following this absence, Iraq returned to win a Bronze medal at the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Summer Olympics in Rome]]. They participated in the next three games but once again did not appear in the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] and [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 games]] to boycott [[apartheid South Africa]]. In joining the [[Olympic boycotts|1976 Boycott]], Iraq became only the second non-African state to participate in the boycott (the other being [[Guyana]]). Since [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], Iraq has appeared in every game despite the [[Iraq War (disambiguation)|Iraq Wars]]. On April 9, 2003 the [[National Olympic Committee of Iraq]] building in Baghdad was damaged in looting and fires from looters. Iraq's Olympic program recovered in time to compete in the [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens Olympics]] the following year, and the Iraq football team almost won a bronze medal but were defeated by Italy in the bronze medal match. Iraq has never competed at the [[Winter Olympic Games]].

Iraq has only won one medal since they have entered the games. They won the medal in Weight lifting. 

They have been represented by [[National Olympic Committee of Iraq]] since entering.

'''''It's a Big Country: An American Anthology''''' is a 1951 [[anthology film]] consisting of eight segments directed by seven directors: [[Clarence Brown]], [[Don Hartman]], [[John Sturges]], [[Richard Thorpe]], [[Charles Vidor]], [[Don Weis]], and [[William A. Wellman]].

==Plot==
A professor traveling on a train is asked by a fellow passenger if he too loves "America". The professor then asks: "Which America?" This provides a lead-in for multiple tales of American life. There is the tale of Mrs. Riordan, an elderly lady from Boston. She is upset about not having been counted in the 1950 census. She asks a newspaper editor named Callaghan to intervene on her behalf, and he makes the mistake of not taking her seriously.

Following on the census story there is a five-minute interlude featuring black Americans, highlighting military service in the Navy, WACs, and Paratroopers. There are clips featuring Benjamin O. Davis Sr. and Benjamin O. Davis Jr. It then moves on to sports figures such as Jackie Robinson, Jesse Owens, Joe Lewis, Sugar Ray Robinson, Levi Jackson.  Entertainers featured in this segment include Marian Anderson (performing in front of the Lincoln Memorial), Lena Horne, Ethel Watters, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Eddie Anderson and the Berry Brothers. Then civil servants are featured, including Adam Clayton Powell Jr. and Ralph Bunche.

There is the story of a Hungarian immigrant named Stefan Szabo who is in the business of selling [[paprika]]. He has several daughters and does not want them to marry men of other nationalities. Rosa falls in love with Icarus, who is Greek, and must overcome her father's objections. There is the tale of Maxie Klein, a young Jewish man, who was injured during the Korean War, and is on his way to his home in Chicago. He stops on his way home to look up the mother of a young man, an Army buddy, who died in the conflict. The mother is not sure what to make of Maxie because her son mentioned no Jewish friend, but ends up touched by his visit. So many tall tales about Texas exist that a tall Texas man takes it upon himself to separate the fact from the fiction.

Adam Burch, a minister in Washington, D.C., whose parishioners include the President of the United States, sometimes tailors his sermons specifically for the President, only to learn later that the President was unable to attend services that day. Scolded to speak for all rather than to one, Rev. Burch gives the sermon of his life, and then learns to his surprise that the President was present on that day and heard every word. Miss Coleman, a school teacher in San Francisco, discovers that her pupil Joey needs glasses. Joey's father, Mr. Esposito, believes they are not necessary and will only bring Joey ridicule from his peers. In the end, it is the father who learns an important lesson.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2895">'''Macchietta''' (literally "little spot"; Plural: '''macchiette''') is a form of  comedy act which was common in Italian theatre between the late 1800s and the second half of the 1900s.

== Style ==
The "macchietta" consisted in comic musical monologues caricaturing stock characters. It was generally committed to the observation of reality, and it sketched characters featuring particular defects or manias, which were further deformed and exaggerated for comical and satirical effects. Every monologue had some music serving as backdrop for the whole performance and the acting was interspersed by brief couplets sung by the comedian.&lt;ref name=curcio&gt;Enzo Giannelli. "Macchietta". Gino Castaldo (edited by). ''Dizionario della canzone italiana''. Curcio Editore, 1990. pp. 954-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Macchiette were performed in [[café-chantant]]s, [[revue]]s and [[avanspettacolo]], and less frequently as part of more elaborate comedy plays. After a golden age between the late 1800s and early 1900s, the genre apparently went out of fashion around 1920, before being resurrected in an amended and updated form in the 1930s, mostly thanks to the duo formed by Gigi Pisano and Giuseppe Cioffi, who created a series of popular macchiette such as "Ciccio Formaggio", "Mazza Pezza e Pizzo" and "Datemi Elisabetta", which were successfully performed by the most popular comedians of the time.&lt;ref name=curcio/&gt;

Starting from the 1950s, the genre eventually declined and gradually disappeared together with the decline of [[avanspettacolo]].&lt;ref name=curcio/&gt;

== Actors ==
[[Nicola Maldacea]] was among the first actors to adopt the genre, and he is regarded as the figure who mostly helped to canonize the macchietta, if not its inventor.&lt;ref name=curcio/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dizionario"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stefania Chiocchini|title=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani|publisher=[[Treccani]], 2014|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/nicola-maldacea_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/|chapter=Maldacea, Nicola}}&lt;/ref&gt; He himself regarded himself as the person who coined the term.&lt;ref name="Dizionario"/&gt; Some of his macchiette had notable poes such as  [[Trilussa]], [[Salvatore Di Giacomo]] and [[Libero Bovio]] as often uncredited authors.&lt;ref name=curcio/&gt;

Other well-known artists specialized in this form of entertainment were the [[Milan]]-based actor and playwright {{Interlanguage link multi|Edoardo Ferravilla|it}}, the Neapolitans [[Raffaele Viviani]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Berardo Cantalamessa|it}} (creator of the classical macchietta "La risata"), and the Roman [[Ettore Petrolini]].&lt;ref name=curcio/&gt;

'''''Man of Steel''''' is a 2013 [[Epic film|epic]] [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Superman]].

It is the first installment in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/07/21/dc-finally-names-its-movie-brand-comic-con-2018|title=DC Finally Names Its Movie Brand - Comic-Con 2018|last=Wade|first=Jessie|date=2018-07-21|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/merrillbarr/2014/04/09/will-warner-brothers-dc-ever-catch-up-to-marvel-television-after-last-nights-agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d/ Will Warner Brothers &amp; DC Ever Catch Up To Marvel Television After Last Night's 'Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'?]. Forbes (May 28, 2014). Retrieved on June 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The film is directed by [[Zack Snyder]], written by [[David S. Goyer]], and stars [[Henry Cavill]], [[Amy Adams]], [[Michael Shannon]], [[Kevin Costner]], [[Diane Lane]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Antje Traue]], [[Ayelet Zurer]], [[Christopher Meloni]], and [[Russell Crowe]]. ''Man of Steel'' is a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Superman in film|''Superman'' film series]] that portrays the character's [[Origin of Superman|origin story]]. In the film, [[Clark Kent]] learns that he is a superpowered alien from the planet [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. He assumes the role of mankind's protector as Superman when faced with the threat of humanity's destruction from [[General Zod]].

Development began in 2008, when Warner Bros. took pitches from comic book writers, [[screenwriter]]s, and [[film director|directors]], opting to reboot the franchise. In 2009, a court ruling resulted in [[Jerry Siegel]]'s family recapturing the rights to Superman's origins and Siegel's copyright. The decision stated that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films, but if they did not begin production on a Superman film by 2011, then the Shuster and Siegel estates would be able to sue for lost revenue on an unproduced film. Producer [[Christopher Nolan]] pitched Goyer's idea after story discussion on ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', and Snyder was hired as the film's director in October 2010. [[Principal photography]] began in August 2011 in [[West Chicago, Illinois]], before moving to [[Vancouver]] and [[Plano, Illinois]].

''Man of Steel'' was released in theaters on June 14, 2013, in conventional 2D, 3D, and [[IMAX]] formats. Despite receiving mixed reviews, the film became a box office success, grossing more than $668 million worldwide. Critics praised the film's visuals, performances, and [[Hans Zimmer]]'s score, but criticized the pacing and aspects of the screenplay. A [[Sequel|follow-up]] entitled ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' was released on March 25, 2016.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words only. The current word count for this summary is 594 words. --&gt;
With Krypton destabilized from mining of the planet's core, [[Jor-El]], chief advisor to Krypton's supreme council, recommends the council give him control of the genetics codex. Before any action can be taken, soldiers led by [[General Zod]], an old friend of Jor-El's, launch an uprising and arrest the councilors. Realising that Krypton is doomed, Jor-El steals the genetic codex sought by Zod and infuses them into the DNA of his infant son, Kal-El – the first naturally born Kryptonian child in centuries. Donning his old armor, Jor-El sacrifices his life to allow his son to escape on a preprogrammed spacecraft. Zod's rebellion is suppressed by the council and are sentenced to the [[Phantom Zone]] after being convicted of treason. Krypton explodes soon after.

Following Jor-El's coordinates, the ship crash lands on Earth in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], [[Kansas]]. A childless couple, [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]], find Kal-El and raise him as their own, naming him [[Clark Kent|Clark]]. Clark eventually becomes an isolated young man as a result of developing superhuman powers which he tries to hide from others. He then learns his true origins from Jonathan, who urges him to keep his powers hidden. Several years later, Jonathan dies in a tornado while refusing to let Clark rescue him. Burdened with guilt and looking for a new purpose in his life, Clark leaves to travel the world for an extended period of time under several disguises.

Several months later, ''[[Daily Planet]]'' reporter [[Lois Lane]] receives an assignment to investigate the discovery of a Kryptonian scout ship in the Canadian Arctic. Disguised as a worker, Clark enters the ship and activates its central computer using a key left by Jor-El, which allows him to communicate with an artificial intelligence modeled after his father. The AI explains that Clark was sent to Earth to guide its people, and presents him with a Kryptonian uniform bearing his family's symbol. While following Clark, Lois inadvertently triggers the ship's security system. Clark uses his powers to rescue Lois before wearing the uniform and testing his flying abilities. Unable to convince supervisor [[Perry White]] to publish an article on the incident, Lois tracks down Clark and agrees to keep his secret safe.

Escaping the Phantom Zone, Zod and his crew intercept a transmission from the scout vessel and travel to Earth. Deducing that Kal-El is nearby, they broadcast a global address demanding that he surrender or risk war. Clark meets with the United States Air Force and agrees to comply, with Lois joining him as a hostage. Zod reveals that he possesses numerous [[terraforming]] devices, the largest called a World Engine, which he salvaged from Kryptonian outposts, which he intends to use to transform Earth into a new Krypton. His science officer, [[Jax-Ur]], extracts Clark's genes to create Kryptonian colonists who will annihilate humanity and build a society based on Zod's ideals of genetic purity.

With help from Jor-El, Clark and Lois flee and warn the U.S. military after an explosive confrontation between Clark and Zod's troops in Smallville, just as Zod orders an invasion. Zod deploys the World Engine from the Kryptonian ship, which touches down in the Indian Ocean and begins firing a beam through the planet towards the ship, severely damaging [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], and initiating the terraforming strategy. Given the codename "[[Superman]]", Clark destroys the terraforming platform while the military launches a suicide attack, sending Zod's troops back to the Phantom Zone. With the ship destroyed and Krypton's only hope of revival gone, Zod vows to destroy the Earth and its inhabitants just to spite Superman. The two Kryptonians engage in a lengthy battle across Metropolis, which concludes when Superman is forced to kill Zod as he attacks a family in a train station.

Superman persuades the government to let him act independently, so long as he does not turn against humanity. To allow access to dangerous situations without attracting attention, Clark takes a job as a freelance reporter for the ''Daily Planet''.

In August 2008, Warner Bros. suggested a reboot of the film series. Studio executive Jeff Robinov planned to have the film released either by 2010 or 2011, explaining "''Superman Returns'' didn't quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to. It didn't position the character the way he needed to be positioned. Had Superman worked in 2006, we would have had a movie for Christmas of this year or 2009.

The plot of ''Man of Steel'' employs a [[nonlinear narrative]], and tells parts of the story in flashback. During story discussions for ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' in 2008, [[David S.

''Man of Steel'' features a redesigned Superman costume by [[James Acheson]] and [[Michael Wilkinson (costume designer)|Michael Wilkinson]].

Zack Snyder said the costume is "a modern aesthetic". He and the producers attempted to devise a suit featuring the red trunks, but could not design one that fit into the tone of the film, leading to their removal from the suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sacks |first1=Ethan |last2=McClear |first2=Sheila |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/superman-loses-red-underpants-article-1.1366032 |title=In 'Man of Steel,' Superman's costume gets 2013 makeover for director Zack Snyder's update |work=Daily News |location=New York |date=June 9, 2013 |accessdate=June 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Wilkinson's unavailability, Snyder chose Acheson to design the suit; however he only started developing it, and Wilkinson finished the development when he returned, and designed the other character's costumes as well.&lt;ref name="esquire"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/culture/michael-wilkinson-superman-look | title=Inside the Evolution of Superman's Look | work=Esquire | date=March 12, 2014 | accessdate=June 19, 2014 | author=Zemler, Emily}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the substantial weight a practical suit would yield, the Kryptonian armor for General Zod was constructed through CGI to allow Shannon "freedom of movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wales |first=George |url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/michael-shannon-talks-man-of-steel-1 |title=Michael Shannon talks Man Of Steel: the CGI suit and Goyer's script |publisher=TotalFilm.com |date=April 23, 2013 |accessdate=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a March 2014 interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', Wilkinson explained the reason for the look of Superman's redesigned suit:

{{quote|A lot of the efforts we took in the film were to explain why the suit looks the way it does. We didn't want it to be a random, ornamental decision. We start the film on the planet of Krypton, which is where the suit comes from, and we go to great pains to show the suit fitting into the culture. All of the people you see on Krypton are wearing this chainmail-like suit, with the same detailing as the Superman suit. Everyone has their family crests on their chests. The cuff and the boot details are shared through all of the different characters we meet on Krypton. So by the time we see Superman in his suit we understand why it looks the way it looks.&lt;ref name="esquire" /&gt;}}

===Effects===
John "DJ" Desjardin served as the visual supervisor for ''Man of Steel'', with [[Weta Digital]], [[Moving Picture Company|MPC]], and [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] providing the [[visual effects]] for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/effects-supremo-joe-letteri-says-zack-snyder-is-placing-emphasis-on-in-camera-effects-in-man-of-steel |publisher=Indiewire |title=Effects Supremo Joe Letteri Says Zack Snyder Is Placing Emphasis On In-Camera Effects In 'Man of Steel' |accessdate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dneg.com/projects/projects_list.html |title=Double Negative: Full Project list |accessdate=July 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915030619/http://www.dneg.com/projects/projects_list.html |archivedate=September 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zack Snyder wanted the film to "appear very natural because there’s some very fantastical things in there and he wanted people to suspend their disbelief, and we the visual effects team had to make it as easy as possible for them to do so." Desjardin noted that the intent in shooting the film was to utilize handheld devices to make the film feel like a "documentary-style" film. "We had to think about what that would mean, since we also had to photograph some crazy action," said Desjardin. "So for a lot of the [[Previsualization|previs]] we did, we’d start to think where our cameras were and where our cameraman was. A lot of the rules are the ''Battlestar Galactica'' rules for the space cams that [[Gary Hutzel|Gary Hurtzel]] [sic] developed for that [[miniseries]], where we want to make sure if we're translating the camera at all it makes sense. Unless the action is so over the top, like in the end where Superman is beating up Zod—we had to break it a bit."&lt;ref name="fxguide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fxguide.com/featured/man-of-steel-vfx-milestones/|title=Man of Steel vfx milestones|work=Fx Guide|date=June 24, 2013|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KryptonMOS.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Alien-like planet landscapes, creatures, and architecture were created by Weta Digital to further enhance the worldbuilding process of planet Krypton.]]
For the first act of the film taking place on the planet Krypton, Weta Digital placed alien-like planet environments, creatures and the principal means of display—a technology the filmmakers called "liquid geometry". Weta Digital visual effects supervisor [[Dan Lemmon]] explained that, "It’s a bunch of silver beads that are suspended through a magnetic field, and the machine is able to control that magnetic field so that the collection of beads behave almost like three-dimensional [[pixel]]s, and they can create a surface that floats in the air and describes whatever the thing is you’re supposed to be seeing." The beads of the display, which up close would appear to be pyramids with a slight [[bevel]], were designed to create a surface of the object to depict inside a "console-like" figure.&lt;ref name="fxguide" /&gt;

In the [[3D modeling|modeling]] and [[animation]] aspect of the liquid geometry, Goodwin explained, "We had to develop a pipeline to bring in assets, so instead of going through the route of reducing the [[polygon]] count to something usable what we would then do—you would take the model in whatever way it was made and just scatter discrete points onto it, and extract the matrix onto the animation and copy these points onto the matrix and have these sparse points behaving in a way that the model would."&lt;ref name="fxguide" /&gt; After the animation, artists duplicated the beads onto the animated geometry for a pre-simulated lighting version to get approval on how the object would read. [[Simulation|Sims]] were then run "on all the targets which would be discrete beads floating around on top of the surface which would have its own set of parameters," said Goodwin. "The bead size or the turbulence that would crawl along the surface constantly updating the orientation was based on the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] provided by the surface. That was then saved to disk and we would use that sim as the final target for the simulation." After the simulation process, Weta Digital ran every bead through a temporal filter to remove jitter to control the noise. Lighting solutions directly worked on the set. Weta utilized [[RenderMan (software)|RenderMan]] to take advantage of improved [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] and [[Geometry instancing|instancing]] objects.&lt;ref name="fxguide" /&gt;

The sequences where Superman utilizes close-combat fight scenes with the other Kryptonians proved to be a major challenge for the filmmakers and the visual effects crew.&lt;ref name="fxguide" /&gt; Desjardin explained, "When we do these fights and these hyper-real things, we don’t want to do the traditional, 'OK I’m a cameraman, I'm shooting a clean plate, I'm going to pan over here to follow the action that’s not really there yet but we'll put the action in later. Because that's us animating the characters to the camera. So we would do that animation with the characters—grappling, punching or flying away—and we would take the real guys up until the point until they were supposed to do that and we'd cut. Then we'd put an environment camera there and take the environment. And then a camera for reference of the actors and get each moment. So then we had a set of [[image resolution|high-res]] stills for the environment and the characters. Then, in post, we take the digi-doubles and animate them according to the speeds we want them to move in our digital environment."&lt;ref name="fxguide" /&gt;

MPC handled the visual effects for the "Smallville encounter" sequence. Before providing the visual effects, the shots were previsualized for the fight choreography. After the previsualizations, live action portions of the scene would be filmed in small pieces. "If say Superman was being punched and would land 50 meters away, we would shoot our start position and end position, and then bridge that gap with the CG takeovers," says [[Guillaume Rocheron]], the MPC visual effects supervisor. A camera rig would then obtain [[key frame]]s of the choreographed actor. "It's a six-still camera rig that's built on a pipe rig so that you can run it in at the end of a setup and get stills of key frames of a performance or an expression," said Desjardin, "and then we could use those hi-res stills to project onto the CG double and get really accurate transition lighting and color—right from the set."&lt;ref name="fxguide" /&gt;

On set, a camera rig was used to capture the environment of the sequence. Dubbed "enviro-cam", the visual effects crew would mount a [[Canon EOS 5D]] and a motorized nodal head, allowing the crew to capture the environment at a 360-degree angle with 55k resolution for every shot, the process would take approximately two to four minutes. The set capture resulted in lighting and textures that could be reprojected onto geometry.&lt;ref name="fxguide" /&gt; Full-screen digital doubles were a major component for the fighting sequences. Digital armor was also added, along with the energy-based Kryptonian helmets. Cyberscan and FACS were conducted with the actors, and [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] and non-polarized reference photos were taken. Superman's cape and costume were scanned in high detail—the cape in particular became a direct extensions of Superman's actions.&lt;ref name="fxguide" /&gt;

For the sequences involving the terraforming of the city Metropolis, Double Negative handled the visual effects for the sequence. In order to construct a Metropolis that seemed convincing and realistic, Double Negative utilized [[Esri]]'s CityEngine to help procedurally deliver the city. "That was a much more sci-fi based role," said Double Negative visual effects supervisor [[Ged Wright]], "so we took what they had done and extended it a great deal. The work we were doing was based around the Downtowns for New York, [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] and Chicago and that gave us the building volumes for heights. We’d skin those volumes with kit parts, but most of it then had to fall down! So we had to rig it for destruction and use it for other aspects of the work as well."&lt;ref name="fxguide" /&gt;

For the destruction of the buildings, the studio rewrote its own asset system to focus towards its dynamic events. The [[Bullet (software)|Bullet]] physics software was a heavily impacted component for the utilization of the destruction. "We wanted to be able to run an RBD event and trigger all these secondary events, whether it was glass or dust simulations—all of those things needed to be chained up and handled in a procedural way," said Wright. "One of the advantages of this was that, because it was all based around a limited number of input components, you can make sure they're modeled in a way they’re usable in effects—you can model something but they'll be another stage to rig it for destruction." Fire, smoke, and water stimulation tools were developed at the Double Negative studio. The studio transitioned between the existing proprietary volume [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] software to rendering in Mantra for elements such as fireball sims. Double Negative also used the in-house fluids tool "Squirt" to handle larger scale sims and interaction for more tightly coupled volumes and particles. Regarding the battle between Superman and Zod, Double Negative implemented real photography onto its digital doubles.&lt;ref name="fxguide" /&gt;

[[Richard Roeper]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said that ''Man of Steel'' covered no new ground with regard to Superman films, and instead, "we're plunged back into a mostly-underwhelming film, with underdeveloped characters and supercharged-fight scenes that drag on and offer nothing new in the way of special-effects creativity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/20677169-421/man-of-steel-beset-by-kryptonite.html |title=‘Man of Steel’ beset by Kryptonite |first=Richard |last=Roeper |authorlink=Richard Roeper |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times |date=June 11, 2013 |accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Boston Globe]]''{{'}}s [[Ty Burr]] wrote, "What’s missing from this Superman saga is a sense of lightness, of pop joy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2013/06/12/saving-world-serious-business-man-steel/7x6ZdGSAQPa6XZJ8XhvHiL/story.html |title=Saving the world is serious business in ‘Man of Steel’ |first=Ty |last=Burr |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=June 12, 2013 |accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]''{{'}}s Ann Hornaday stated that with "Hans Zimmer’s turgid, over-produced score", the film "is an exceptionally-unpleasant viewing experience".&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/man-of-steel-henry-cavill-stars-as-superman-in-this-bombastic-reboot/2013/06/12/6d77d5d0-d36c-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_story.html |title=‘Man of Steel’: Henry Cavill stars as Superman in this bombastic reboot |first=Ann |last=Hornaday |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 12, 2013 |accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''[[The Denver Post]]''{{'}}s Lisa Kennedy, the chief problem with ''Man of Steel'' is the "rhythm and balance in the storytelling and directing" which resulted in a film that swings "between destructive overstatement and flat-footed homilies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=Kennedy |url=http://www.denverpost.com/movies/ci_23446778/movie-review-s-does-not-stand-soar-man |title=Movie review: The "S" does not stand for soar in "Man of Steel" |newspaper=The Denver Post |date=June 14, 2013 |accessdate=June 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among its detractors were [[Joe Keatinge]], [[Sean McKeever]], Gabriel Hardman and [[Mark Waid]]. MacDonald praised the film's action, drama and leads Henry Cavill and Amy Adams. Van Sciver singled out Cavill in particular for praise. Gage called it the best ''Superman'' film since 1980's ''[[Superman II]]''. Hardman said that he liked a lot of the mechanics but did not connect with the characters, which robbed the story of tension. Waid, who wrote the origin miniseries ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'', criticized the film for its overall "joyless" tone, and for Superman's decision to kill Zod,&lt;ref name=MTV/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Mark Waid|author=Waid, Mark|date=June 14, 2013|url=http://thrillbent.com/blog/man-of-steel-since-you-asked/|title=Man of Steel, since you asked|publisher=Thrillbent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Puchko, Kristy (June 17, 2013).

Morrison also questioned the need for a superhero to kill,&lt;ref&gt;Truitt, Brian (July 28, 2013).

''[[USA Today]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; as did artist [[Neal Adams]], who suggested that other avenues were open to Superman when Zod threatened innocents with his [[Heat vision (fiction)|heat vision]], such as covering his eyes.

The success of ''Man of Steel'' started Warner Bros. plans of a cinematic universe featuring other DC Comics characters. In June 2013, Goyer was hired to write the sequel to ''Man of Steel'', as well as a ''Justice League'' script, with the previous draft being scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nikki Finke|url=http://deadline.com/2013/06/man-of-steel-sequel-underway-with-zack-snyder-and-david-s-goyer-517621/|title=‘Man Of Steel’ Sequel Underway With Zack Snyder And David S.

A '''minicomic''' is a creator-published [[comic book]], often [[photocopying|photocopied]] and stapled or with a handmade binding. In the United Kingdom and Europe the term '''[[British small press comics|small press comic]]''' is equivalent with minicomic, reserved for those publications measuring A6 (105&amp;nbsp;mm × 148&amp;nbsp;mm) or less.

Minicomics, sometimes called [[ashcan copy|ashcan copies]], are a common inexpensive way for those who want to make their own comics on a very small budget, with mostly informal means of [[distribution (business)|distribution]]. A number of [[cartoonist]]s — such as [[Jessica Abel]], [[Julie Doucet]], and [[Adrian Tomine]] — have started their careers this way and later gone on to more traditional types of publishing, while other established artists — such as [[Matt Feazell]] and [[John Porcellino]] — continue to publish minicomics as their main means of production. 

==Overview==
The term "minicomic" was originally used in the United States and has a somewhat confusing history. Originally, it referred only to size: a ''[[Digest size#Comics digests|digest comic]]'' measured 5.5&amp;nbsp;inches wide by 8.5&amp;nbsp;inches tall, while a ''minicomic'' was 5.5&amp;nbsp;inches by 4.25&amp;nbsp;inches.{{cn|date=October 2016}} 

Currently, there is no standard format for a minicomic. Anything between something the size of a [[postage stamp]] to regular comic book size can be considered a minicomic. The term "minicomic" is used in a more general sense, emphasizing the publication's handmade, informal aspect rather than the format. By this loose definition, a single photocopied page folded in quarters would still be a minicomic, but so would a thicker digest-sized comic, or even a large, elaborate, and relatively expensive photocopied booklet with a [[screen-printing|silkscreened]] cover. Even some professionally printed and bound booklets are referred to as minicomics, as long as they are published by the artist and marketed in minicomic venues, but this usage is controversial.{{cn|date=October 2016}} 

Many minicomics are non-standard comic book sizes for aesthetic reasons,{{cn|date=October 2016}} or are often connected to [[graphic design]] and book print "tricks" to look good.{{cn|date=October 2016}} Many of these typical sizes are convenient for artists using standard office supplies: a [[Paper size|US letter page]] can be folded in half to make a digest, or in quarters for a minicomic. These comics are generally photocopied, although some are produced in larger quantities using [[offset printing]]. 

In North America, the United Kingdom, and Malaysia, minicomics are rarely found in traditional "[[direct market]]" comic-book stores; they are often sold directly by the artist at book fairs or through the mail, ordered from [[website]]s, or handled by small bookstores and distributors that carry [[zine]]s. In terms of production and distribution issues and their audience, minicomics&amp;mdash;of all of the sizes and types mentioned above&amp;mdash;have much more in common with each other, and with zines, than with any traditionally published comics.{{cn|date=October 2016}} In Europe many specialized comic books stores have a special little corner dedicated to the odd off-size little self-printed books.{{cn|date=October 2016}} At comic book conventions, such as the one in [[Angoulême]], there are large markets where the little books are available. Because most of the books are rather cheap and were printed in limited quantities, they have become a target of collecters.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

Minicomics typically have no editorial oversight, and both their content and quality vary widely. Many of the creators of minicomics do not expect to make a significant amount of money, or even cover their costs, with the price they charge for their comics.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

==History==
The earliest and most popular comics in mini- and digest sizes&amp;mdash;predating not only the term ''minicomic'', but even the standard comic-book format&amp;mdash;were the anonymous and pornographic [[Tijuana bible]]s of the 1920s.

The [[Underground comix|underground]] publisher [[San Francisco Comic Book Company]], run by [[Gary Arlington]], published a number of minicomics in the period 1968–1976, including minicomics by [[Art Spiegelman]] and [[Bill Griffith]].

In c. 1968, [[Carl Gafford]] created [[Blue Plaque Publications]], the first [[minicomic co-op]], a cooperative of minicomic creators that traded and promoted small press comics and fanzines.

[[Jack T. Chick]]'s "[[Chick tracts]]", which began appearing widely in the early 1970s, also used a mini-size, although they are not typically considered mincomics.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

[[Matt Feazell]]'s popular ''Cynicalman'' mincomics, which began in 1980, utilize the [[Paper size|US letter page]] folded in quarters; the same format used by Alfred Huete's award-winning ''DADA'' mini.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

Many minicomics in the 1980s were produced by artists influenced by the [[underground comix]] scene who were unable to get work published in underground and [[Alternative comics|alternative]] publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dowers |first1=Michael |title=Newave! The Underground Mini Comix Of The 1980s |year=2010 |publisher=Fantagraphics Books |isbn=978-1-60699-313-2 |pages=9–11 |chapter=Introduction }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Dowers' [[Starhead Comix]] published many minicomics throughout the latter half of the 1980s, before the company moved to traditional comic book printing and distribution.

[[John Porcellino]]'s ''[[King-Cat Comics]]'', first published in May 1989 and still being published, is among the best-known and longest-running minicomics titles.

In the 1990s, before the widespread adoption of the [[World Wide Web]], minicomics became a popular form of self-distribution for alternative cartoonists, aided by such publications as ''[[Factsheet Five]]''. Comic book series like [[Jessica Abel]]'s ''Artbabe'', [[Julie Doucet]]'s ''[[Dirty Plotte]]'',&lt;ref name=plottemini&gt;[http://www.comics.org/series.lasso?SeriesID=29488 ''Dirty Plotte'' mini-comics], Grand Comics Database. Accessed Oct. 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adrian Tomine]]'s ''[[Optic Nerve (comics)|Optic Nerve]]''&lt;ref&gt;''32 Stories: The Complete Optic Nerve Mini-Comics'' (Drawn and Quarterly, 1998) {{ISBN|1-896597-00-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; all started out as self-published minicomics before being picked up by legitimate publishers.

In 1993, [[Rick Bradford]] (who had been involved in the minicomics scene since 1985) began publishing ''Poopsheet'', a zine that reviewed other small publications, including minicomics. ''Poopsheet'' eventually became a website and is now known as The Poopsheet Foundation, which is dedicated to archiving the history of minicomics.

The [[Ignatz Award]] for Best Minicomic has been awarded at the [[Small Press Expo]] every year since 1997.

In 2003, cartoonists [[Andy Hartzell]]&lt;ref name=Hartzell&gt;{{cite web|title=Prism Comics- Andy Hartzell |url=http://prismcomics.org/profile.php?id=1399 |publisher=Prism comics |accessdate=16 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520114056/http://prismcomics.org/profile.php?id=1399 |archivedate=20 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jesse Reklaw]] co-founded Global Hobo Distro, a [[Direct market|distributor]] dedicated to hand-made and hard-to-find comics that is partnered with [[Last Gasp]].

==Alternate meaning==
The term '''minicomic''' also refers to the small comics booklets that come in the packages of some toys:

* Masters of the Universe (1981–2014) — The first [[Masters of the Universe]] toys did not have a TV series, and thus came with little story booklets (and later, comics) that showed the original background of the series ([[He-Man]] as a barbarian, [[Skeletor]] from another dimension, etc.). However, after the later sources ([[DC Comics]] and the TV series) started to change that background (He-Man as [[Prince Adam]], for example) the comics began to reflect those changes. See [[List of He-Man Minicomics]].
* [[Atari Force]] (1982) — a five-issue series included with certain [[Atari 2600]] game cartridges.
* Swordquest (1982–1983) — three comics included with the [[Atari 2600]] cartridges for the [[Swordquest]] series.
* Super Powers (1984–1985) — [[Kenner Products]] created a collection of action figures based on the [[DC Comics]] super-heroes and super-villains called ''[[Super Powers Collection|Super Powers]]''. The first two waves of the collection came with minicomics which featured the character with which it came, one of the villains from the collection (who, obviously, was the antagonist of the story inside the comic) and other heroes featured in the collection. See [[List of Super Powers Minicomics]].
* [[Transformers (toy line)|Transformers]] (2002–2005) — the toys of [[Transformers: Armada]] and [[Transformers: Energon]] came with minicomics that featured the characters of the toy lines.
* Marvel Mega Morphs (2005) — this was a toy line created by [[Toy Biz]] in order to compete with [[Hasbro]]'s Transformers. The [[Mega Morphs]] were transforming robots patterned on [[Marvel Comics]] super heroes. Each figure came with a minicomic featuring the Megamorph with which it came. All six minicomics formed a complete storyline.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2552">A '''musical setting''' is a [[musical composition]] that is written on the basis of a [[literary work]]. The literary work is said to be '''set''', or adapted, '''to music'''. Musical settings include [[choral music]] and other [[vocal music]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/setting Definition] Cambridge dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; A musical setting is made to particular words, such as poems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/setting Definition] Oxford dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, a musical [[arrangement]] is a musical reconceptualization of a previously composed work, rather than a brand new piece of music. An arrangement often refers to a change in medium or style and can be instrumental, not necessarily vocal music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/36011/arrangement Arrangement], Encyclopædia Britannica online&lt;/ref&gt;

Texts commonly used in choral settings include the [[Mass (music)|mass]] and the [[Music for the Requiem Mass|requiem]] in [[Catholicism|Western Christianity]], and the [[Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom]] and the [[All-night vigil]] in [[Eastern Christianity]]. Examples include [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Great Mass]], and [[Mykola Leontovych|Leontovych]]'s [[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Leontovych)|Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom]].

A poem that has been set to music is known as an [[art song]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Randel | first = Don Michael | year = 2003 | title = The Harvard Dictionary of Music | publisher = Harvard University Press | page = 61 | isbn = 0-674-01163-5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=02rFSecPhEsC&amp;pg=PA61 | accessdate = 2012-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Lied]] (German variant). Composers known for their art songs include [[Franz Schubert]] and [[Robert Schumann]].

==Some notable settings==
*[[George Frideric Handel]]'s setting of ''[[Zadok the Priest]]'' (1721)
*[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]'s setting of [[Ave verum corpus (Mozart)|''Ave verum corpus'']] (1791)
*[[Franz Schubert]]'s setting of [[Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart]]'s poem, ''[[Die Forelle]]'', "The Trout" (1817)
*[[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s setting of the [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem Mass]] (1874)
*[[Hubert Parry]]'s setting of [[William Blake]]'s poem ''[[And did those feet in ancient time]]'', also known as "Jerusalem" (1916)

'''''NHL 2005''''' is an [[ice hockey]] video game released in 2004, the successor to ''[[NHL 2004]]''.

==Features==

===Improvements/flaws===
''NHL 2005'' features ''Open Ice Control'', including moving players without the puck and also a complete [[World Cup of Hockey|World Cup]] mode where each team can be created from scratch. The user was now allowed to import digitized home arenas for the scratchbuilt teams (the 30 NHL arenas plus [[Nuremberg Arena]], [[Kölnarena]], [[Stockholm Globe Arena]], Helsinki [[Hartwall Areena]] and Prague [[Sazka Arena]] were available). Additional NHL jerseys and logos were also available including those of the defunct [[Atlanta Flames]], [[Winnipeg Jets (1972–96)|Winnipeg Jets]], [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)]], [[Quebec Nordiques]] as well as the old style [[Los Angeles Kings]], [[Washington Capitals]] and [[Vancouver Canucks]] uniforms of the 1970s and the 1980s.

The IIHF license which granted the World Cup mode also allowed EA to use real-life international jerseys for the only time (previously released games used unique jerseys designed by the game's staff which only bore a passing similarity to their real life counterparts, so the jersey shows their flag.) The PC version of the game was stripped down to the bare essentials, including the omitting of the create-a-player feature. These omissions were possibly due to the labour dispute that season, but EA explained that they had not perfected the new create-a-player interface, which would have allowed for far greater customizability than what was previously available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53592">The '''New England Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame and Fan Fest'''  is an American [[professional wrestling]] [[hall of fame]]. It was established in January 2008 to honor select wrestling personalities who have made significant contributions to professional wrestling in [[New England]] and the [[Northeastern United States]].

==History==
The idea for the hall of fame was conceived by Joseph Bruen, a longtime [[ring announcer]] and [[promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] in [[Massachusetts]], who felt that wrestling personalities from the New England region, both regional and national, should be recognized for their achievements in pro wrestling.

Starting in 2009, the induction ceremonies have taken place at an annual banquet dinner at the Brotherhood of the Holy Ghost Charity Hall (Brightridge Club) in [[East Providence, Rhode Island]]. 2010 saw the first of the "fan fests", a two-day event in which inductees and special guests could interact with the fans, as well as the banquet dinner; one of the evening's highlights was the induction of the Savoldi wrestling family which included a speech from [[Angelo Savoldi]] who, at 95 years old, was the [[List of oldest surviving professional wrestlers|world's oldest living wrestler]] at the time. In addition to the hall of fame inductees, the event has also featured many wrestling stars at its "fan fest" weekend participating as [[guest speaker]]s as well as [[autograph|autograph signings]] and Q&amp;A sessions. The 2011 edition, for example, was hosted by longtime [[World Wrestling Federation]] [[ring announcer]] [[Howard Finkel]] and was attended by former inductees [[Ox Baker]] (2009) and [[Dan Marsh|"Dangerous" Danny Davis]] (2010) as well as [[Short Sleeve Sampson]], [[The Iron Sheik]], [[Brutus Beefcake|Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake]], [[Matt Osbourne|Doink the Clown]], [[Paul Bearer]], [[Tammy Lynn Sytch]], [[Thea Trinidad|Rosita]], [[Balls Mahoney]], [[Axl Rotten]], [[Shane Douglas]], [[Gillberg (wrestler)|Duane Gill]], [[Armando Estrada]], [[Kenny Dykstra]], [[Jay Lethal]], [[Tom Matera|Antonio Thomas]], and [[manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] [[John Cena, Sr.|Johnny Fabulous]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3760">'''Online music education''' is a recent development in the field of [[music education]] consisting of the application of new technologies associated with [[distance learning]] and [[online education]] for the purpose of teaching and learning music in an [[online]] environment mediated by [[computers]] and the [[internet]].

The origins of online music education may be traced to the use of technologies to supplement face-to-face learning in traditional classroom settings, however in recent years it has expanded to include the offering of entire degree programs – even [[doctoral degree]]s – online.  

The rise of technologies leading to the development of online music education is well documented, and  such studies have become particularly popular in the United States in recent years (Schlager, 2008; Webster, 2007). Salavuo (2006) has examined the recent popularization of informal engagement with music technology in online social networks, which may embody a form of informal community music education. The potential of online music education to create positive change in terms of professional development has been noted by various scholars (Hebert, 2008; Sherbon &amp; Kish, 2005); However, concerns have also been raised regarding the absence of a sufficient research base concerning the effectiveness of online music education (Hebert, 2007; Webster, 2007). It is likely that more studies will be seen in this high-growth area in the coming years.

== Institutions offering online music education ==
The following is a partial list of North American institutions that offer online degree programs in [[music education]]:

*[[Boston University College of Fine Arts]]
*[[University of Florida College of the Arts]]
*[[University of Georgia]]
*[[Rutgers University]] [[Mason Gross School of the Arts]]
*[[Auburn University]]
*[[Duquesne University]] [[Mary Pappert School of Music]]
*[[Ohio University]]
*[[University of South Florida]]
*[[University of Hawaii at Manoa]]
*[[Kent State University]]
*[[Stephen F. Austin State University]]
*[[University of Southern Mississippi]]
*[[East Carolina University]]

The most common degree offered online in this subject area is a Master of Music, although one institution also offers a [[Doctor of Musical Arts]] degree. As of mid-2008, one institution - Boston University - has over 800 online graduate students in music education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1536">A '''para-balloon''' is a tool used in a variety of games. It is in a parachute shape and is made up of fragments of colorful cloth in multiple, bright colours.

==Origin==
An unknown Japanese visitor saw a game involving a parachute at a [[YMCA]] in the [[United States]] in October 1960 and also in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and was attracted to it. In the hope that children could play the game he returned to Japan and searched unsuccessfully for that kind of parachute. He later came to know that there were many good [[shoemaker]]s in [[Kobe]].  He asked them to make 20 pieces and also to design games involving the parachute. He named it as Para-balloon after Parachute and Balloon.

==Use==
A para-balloon is the symbol of [[Grasshopper Scout]]s from [[The Scout Association of Hong Kong]].  It is used to train groups of children, aged 6 to 8.  The association uses the name 快樂傘 in Chinese.  Many schools, kindergartens and youth centres utilise para-balloons, following the Grasshopper Scouts.

Para-balloon games are sometimes incorporated in physical exercises for elderly people in [[Hong Kong]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="618">In [[rhetoric]], '''paromoiosis''' is parallelism of sound between the words of two clauses approximately equal in size.  The similarity of sound can occur at the beginning of the clauses, at the end (where it is equivalent to [[homoioteleuton]]), in the middle or throughout the clauses.

For example: "Open to gifts and open to words."

'''Reto-Moto ApS''' is a Danish [[video game developer]] based in [[Copenhagen]]. Founded in 1997 and reformed in April 2008, the company is best known developing ''[[Heroes &amp; Generals]]'' (2016).

== History ==
Prior to founding Reto-Moto, all founding members had been part of various [[United States]]-based [[demo group]]s, but decided to move back to [[Copenhagen]] in 1997, where they founded Reto-Moto later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/128748/From_Hitman_to_RetoMoto_Jesper_Kyd_follows_his_own_sound.php |title=From  Hitman  to Reto-Moto: Jesper Kyd follows his own sound |first=Mike |last=Griffin |date= |website=gamasutra.com |accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1998, Reto-Moto, at the time consisting of Jesper Vorsholt Jørgensen, Rasmus Guldberg-Kjær, Martin Munk Pollas, Karsten Lemann Hvidberg, Jacob Andersen, Janos Flösser and David Guldbrandsen, and Danish film studio [[Nordisk Film]] launched [[IO Interactive]], another developer, as a [[joint venture]].&lt;ref name="Berlingske Business"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.business.dk/diverse/hitman-solgt-til-england |title=Hitman solgt til England |author= |date=4 March 2004 |website=business.dk |accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nordisk Film held a 40.3% stake in the venture, with the other 59.7% owned by Reto-Moto and its staff.&lt;ref name="Berlingske Business" /&gt; Due to IO Interactive's rapid success through ''[[Hitman: Codename 47]]'' in 2000, Reto-Moto was put on ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-devs-go-solo-with-reto-moto/1100-6189099/ |title=Hitman devs go solo with Reto-Moto |first=Brendan |last=Sinclair |date=11 April 2008 |website=gamespot.com |accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, all stakes in IO Interactive were sold to [[Eidos Interactive]] in March 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news040304eidosio |title=Eidos acquires Hitman developer as profits rise |author= |date= |website=eurogamer.net |accessdate=26 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sacred Games''''' is an Indian [[web television]] thriller series based on [[Vikram Chandra (novelist)|Vikram Chandra]]'s 2006  [[Sacred Games (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The first Netflix original series in India, it is directed by [[Vikramaditya Motwane]] and [[Anurag Kashyap]], who produced it under their banner [[Phantom Films]]. The novel was adapted by [[Varun Grover (writer)|Varun Grover]], Smita Singh and Vasant Nath. Kelly Luegenbiehl, Erik Barmack and Motwane served as the executive producers.

Sartaj Singh ([[Saif Ali Khan]]) is a troubled police officer in Mumbai who receives a phone call from gangster Ganesh Gaitonde ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]), who tells him to save the city within 25 days.

Other cast members include [[Radhika Apte]], [[Girish Kulkarni]], [[Neeraj Kabi]], [[Jeetendra Joshi]], [[Rajshri Deshpande]], [[Jatin Sarna]], [[Elnaaz Norouzi]] and [[Kubra Sait]].

The development of ''Sacred Games'' started after Erik Barmack, the Vice-president of [[Netflix]] contacted Motwane to create Indian content for the platform in 2014. They opted to adapt Chandra's novel in the local Indian language, to which Motwane agreed. After the script was completed, Motwane asked Kashyap to co-direct; Motwane directed the sequences involving Singh while Kashyap directed Gaitonde's. Swapnil Sonawane was the [[director of photography]] for Motwane; Sylvester Fonseca and Aseem Bajaj filmed the scenes directed by Kashyap. [[Aarti Bajaj]] was the editor and [[Alokananda Dasgupta]] composed the background score.

----
The first episode of Sacred Games starts off with a dog falling off a high-rise building in Mumbai, a plot element that will be emphasised later on in the season. Following that is the entry of Nawazuddin Siddiqui, as yesteryear gangster Ganesh Gaitonde, who hints that something sinister is about to happen in Mumbai. Running parallel is the story of junior Mumbai Police cop Sartaj Singh (Saif Ali Khan) who is looking for a big case to prove his mettle to the corrupt department he works in. He gets an out-of-the-blue call from Gaitonde himself giving him a tip about something destructive that will happen in Mumbai in the next 25 days. Gaitonde claims to know Sartaj Singh's father. 
----
Sartaj Singh is able to trace Gaitonde's location, and the gangster shoots himself in the head in front of the cop. What follows is a flashback story, narrated by Nawazuddin Siddiqui himself, that focuses on the dark childhood and teenage life of the gangster that led him to become a ruthless criminal.&lt;ref name = sg&gt;https://gadgets.ndtv.com/entertainment/features/sacred-games-season-1-episode-plot-summary-download-offline-ending-explained-1881071&lt;/ref&gt;

 |ShortSummary =  
The episode is named after 'Halahala', an extremely toxic poison that comes out as a by-product of an attempt by Devas and Asuras to extract Amrit, the nectar for eternal life.
----
With the death of Ganesh Gaitonde starts a 25-day countdown that carries on throughout the length of the show. Sacred Games now brings Bollywood to the fold, introducing an up and coming actress who seems to have some connection with Gaitonde; seeing the news of the gangster's death, she threatens someone to get her file from the murdered talent manager otherwise, else she would bring everyone down with her. This episode also marks the entry of Radhika Apte as Anjali Mathur, a Research &amp; Analysis Wing (RAW) agent investigating the case. Sartaj Singh is suspended by Deputy Commissioner of Police Parulkar for not cooperating with him in an investigation over misuse of power. The suspended Sartaj Singh joins forces with Anjali Mathur and discovers that the murdered talent manager was keeping fake currency supplied by Pakistan's ISI (a case Mathur had been investigating at RAW), and had also been escorting Bollywood and TV actresses to Gaitonde.
----
Intertwined in between is the story of Gaitonde's emergence as the mega gangster of slums in 1980-1990s' Bombay. He is seen attempting to gather power, but beaten up by a slumlord and gets his first visit from Parulkar, a sub-inspector back then. Notably, the parts of Nawazuddin Siddiqui's flashback have been shot by Anurag Kashyap, while Vikramaditya Motwane has shot the current-day scenes that involve Saif Ali Khan's character.&lt;ref name = sg/&gt;

---- 
The episode starts off with 'harmless' cop rivalry that involves a blow to the face between Sartaj Singh and Majid, in classic Vikramaditya Motwane style. The chase resumes as cop Sartaj uses evidence from the murder of the talent manager to track back to a TV soap actress, Nayanika, who is coerced into giving sexual favours to Gaitonde's most trusted gang member, Bunty. As before, a flashback starts and viewers are transported back to how Gaitonde met this gang member. It is then followed by Gaitonde's admiration and pursuit of a girl, Kukoo, who is involved with the rival gang's leader, Suleiman Isa. Events start pacing up fast and a shootout helps Gaitonde get the girl. Back in the current-day scenario, Singh and Mathur get closer to Bunty by laying a trap through Bunty's girlfriend.&lt;ref name = sg/&gt;

----
The setup is slammed wide open as Bunty catches sight of the hidden camera planted by Singh's informant, Nayanika. Singh, waiting right outside Bunty's house, is caught and taken into the house where he tries to goad the gangster into revealing the impending danger on the city of Mumbai. Bunty is seen rushing off to a warehouse complex in the outskirts of the city, where he meets with a mysterious man who has been seen in a couple of instances in the past few episodes, mostly involved in covering up evidence. Once again, the story goes back to gangster Gaitonde's past where he is shown climbing his way up the ladder by mingling with corrupt politicians and police officials. This is where we meet a small-time politician who will later go on to become the Union Home Minister, with ties to both Gaitonde and DCP Parulkar. The episode ends with a cliffhanger that shows a burqa-clad individual pointing a gun towards Gaitonde, as part of the flashback.&lt;ref name = sg/&gt;

 |ShortSummary = Disappointed by Anjali's view towards Nainika, Sartaj himself tries to save the TV starlet but dramatically ends interrupting the  RAW's plans to catch Bunty. In 1992, as political unrest increases, Gaitonde and Isa's enimity drastically increases.
----
To save his informant, Sartaj Singh follows Bunty and his sidemen to the safehouse. The cop is cornered, though fortunately for him, Mumbai Police arrives. However, instead of apprehending Bunty, they shoot him dead on DCP Parulkar's orders. However, the informant Nayanika, whom Sartaj Singh feels responsible for, is also shot dead in the process.
----
Back in Bombay in 1992, Gaitonde's terror spreads as his men take out rival gang members by the dozen. He decides to settle down by getting married but the rival gangster Isa sends him a "gift" of his own by murdering one of his closest aides on the day of the wedding. Gaitonde anyway decides to get married, to his house maid. The story shifts to the Bollywood actress, mentioned initially in the second episode, who is blackmailed by her actor boyfriend to act in an in-house film production or risk getting caught in the Gaitonde scandal.&lt;ref name = sg/&gt;

 |ShortSummary =  When Sartaj's constable, Katekar ([[Jitendra Joshi]]), is pressured to investigate the case of a young man from a Muslim slum who was found missing for many days, finds a relation between the boy and a theft in nearby shop.
----
Having tried to find a link between his father and Gaitonde, Sartaj Singh turns to his mother but comes back without an answer. Meanwhile, the Bollywood actress uses her police links to get her blackmailing boyfriend in trouble. She uses the "dog murder" in the first scene of the first episode as a point of leverage against him. On the sidelines of the plot runs a story of a small-town gang from a Muslim-majority slum of modern-day Mumbai. Sartaj Singh and his team of cops go after these thugs and the situation ends up getting violent. Singh's main sidekick is murdered as are all the hoodlums as part of a countermeasure. In the meanwhile, back in the 1990s, Gaitonde finds about a traitor among his closest camaraderie and takes action by killing the traitor and his brother.&lt;ref name = sg/&gt;

----
Despite having links with corrupt senior police officials, the Bollywood actress somehow gets cornered by honest cop Sartaj Singh who extracts names of suspicious individuals who might be involved with the incident expected to hit Mumbai in the next few days. In Anurag Kashyap's flashback story, rival gang members come to take a last hit at killing Gaitonde but end up murdering the gangster's wife. Gaitonde, for the next few days, goes on a rampage, killing innocent people on the streets of Mumbai. He also sets on fire entire slums filled with Muslim families. This triggers the city's police department to put him in jail where he is beaten every day with no mercy - while he thinks this treatment is being meted out to him for the murders he committed, it is actually a way for a godman to break his spirit, using the police. In the parallel current-day story, Sartaj Singh and the RAW agent Mathur inch closer to the people involved in the upcoming attack. While Singh drifts off to find a secret location, Mathur (Apte) is shot dead by the same mysterious man in previous episodes.&lt;ref name = sg/&gt;

----
The final episode of the first season of Sacred Games is full of twists and turns. We finally see the link between Gaitonde and Sartaj Singh's father, wherein the latter is just a helpful prison officer who helps the gangster with food and water during his torturous stay under lockup. Sartaj Singh, in his pursuit, is caught and tied right in front of the mysterious man, who is now revealed to be a key player of the upcoming attack, supplying weapons in trucks commissioned by the Union Home Minister. Mumbai Police officers track down Singh's location and take over the location that is filled with arms and ammunition. While being questioned by NSA agents, the Union Home Minister reveals little but his comments to Parulkar later hint at a religious war brewing in the background. In a sort-of-conclusive ending to the series, Sartaj Singh tried to connect the missing pieces of the puzzle and a discourse by a godman (previously seen in the 1990s flashbacks as the mastermind behind Gaitonde's torture) on TV helps him locate a secret hideout that houses materials required to survive a nuclear blast.&lt;ref name = sg/&gt;

The episode titles are inspired by [[Hindu mythology]]. The first episode titled "Aswatthama", was based on the [[Ashwatthama|namesake character]] from the Sanskrit epic [[Mahabharata]].

Several changes were made while the team adapted the novel as a series. The character of Kuckoo, a [[transgender]] woman, is mentioned in passing, as a dancer whom a police officer fell in love with. A constable narrates this to Sartaj, describing Kuckoo as "beautiful as a Kashmiri apple". In the series, Kuckoo is an extended character and is shown as the love interest of Gaitonde.&lt;ref name=head&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scroll.in/reel/885511/how-sacred-games-stays-true-to-the-source-novel-as-well-as-turns-it-on-its-head|title=How 'Sacred Games' stays true to the source novel but also turns it on its head|last=Rao|first=Soumya|publisher=Scroll.in|date=10 July 2018|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the character of Malcolm Murad, who is mentioned once in the novel, has an extended role as an assassin.&lt;ref name=head/&gt; Few other changes were  made.

===Casting and characters===
[[File:Saif Ali Khan snapped at Imperial Hotel, New Delhi 05.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The series marked actor [[Saif Ali Khan]]'s first venture into television]]
Several characters in the series speak different Indian languages like [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]. Kashyap mentioned that it gives a "real sense of what India is".&lt;ref name=panicker/&gt; [[Saif Ali Khan]] called the series an experiment and said he agreed to do it because "people are willing to watch programmes from other countries with sub-titles because good stories transcend boundaries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/04/sacred-games-can-netflixs-mumbai-mob-drama-turn-india-on-to-tv|title=Sacred Games: can Netflix's Mumbai mob drama turn India on to TV?|last=Waheed|first=Alia|work=The Guardian|date=4 July 2018|accessdate=5 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704145752/https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jul/04/sacred-games-can-netflixs-mumbai-mob-drama-turn-india-on-to-tv|archive-date=4 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan found an "interesting arc" in the character of Sartaj Singh and called it "troubled and honest".

[[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]] said that he treated the role of a gangster as a human being.

Numerous peoples throughout the world have at one point in time honored bulls as sacred. In [[Sumerian mythology]], [[Marduk]] is the "bull of [[Utu]]". In [[Hinduism]], [[Shiva]]'s steed is [[Nandi bull|Nandi]], the Bull. The sacred bull survives in the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. The [[bull]], whether lunar as in Mesopotamia or solar as in India, is the subject of various other cultural and [[religion|religious]] incarnations as well as modern mentions in [[New Age]] cultures.

==In prehistorical art==
[[Aurochs]] are depicted in many [[Paleolithic]] European cave paintings such as those found at [[Lascaux]] and Livernon in France. Their life force may have been thought to have magical qualities, for early carvings of the aurochs have also been found. The impressive and dangerous aurochs survived into the [[Iron Age]] in Anatolia and the Near East and were worshipped throughout that area as sacred animals; the earliest survivals of a bull worship are at neolithic [[Çatalhöyük#Culture|Çatalhöyük]].

The bull was seen in the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)#History and mythology|Taurus]] by the [[Chalcolithic]] and had marked the [[New Year]] at springtide by the [[Bronze Age]], for 4000–1700 BCE.

==In antiquity==

===Mesopotamia===
The [[Sumer]]ian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' depicts the killing by [[Gilgamesh]] and [[Enkidu]] of the [[Bull of Heaven]] as an act of defiance of the gods. From the earliest times, the bull was lunar in [[Mesopotamia]] (its horns representing the crescent moon).&lt;ref&gt;Jules Cashford, ''The Moon: Myth and Image'' 2003, begins the section "Bull and cow" pp 102ff with the simple observation, "Other animals become epiphanies of the Moon because they look like the moon.... the sharp horns of a bull or cow were seen to match the pointed curve of the waxing and waning crescents so exactly that the powers of the one were attributed to the other, each gaining the other's potency as well as their own."&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=September 2018}}

===Egypt===
[[File:Hathor with sacred eye in papyrus.JPG|thumb|[[Hathor]] as a cow, wearing her necklace and showing her sacred eye on the ''[[Papyrus of Ani]]''.]]

In Egypt, the bull was worshiped as [[Apis (deity)|Apis]], the embodiment of [[Ptah]] and later of [[Osiris]]. A long series of ritually perfect bulls were identified by the god's priests, housed in the temple for their lifetime, then embalmed and encased in a giant [[sarcophagus]]. A long sequence of monolithic stone sarcophagi was housed in the [[Serapeum]], and was rediscovered by [[Auguste Mariette]] at [[Saqqara]] in 1851. The bull was also worshipped as [[Mnevis]], the embodiment of [[Atum]]-[[Ra]], in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]].  ''Ka'' in Egyptian is both a religious concept of life-force/power and the word for bull.

===Eastern Anatolia===
We cannot recreate a specific context for the bull skulls with horns (''[[bucranium|bucrania]]'') preserved in an 8th millennium BCE sanctuary at [[Çatalhöyük]] in eastern Anatolia. The sacred bull of the [[Hattians]], whose elaborate standards were found at [[Alaca Höyük]] alongside those of the [[deer in mythology|sacred stag]], survived in [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] and [[Hittite mythology]] as Seri and Hurri ("Day" and "Night"), the bulls who carried the weather god [[Teshub]] on their backs or in his chariot and grazed on the ruins of cities.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkes and Woolley, 1963; Vieyra, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crete===
[[File:Knossos Bull-Leaping Fresco.jpg|thumb|The [[Bull-Leaping Fresco]]: [[Knossos]]]]

Bulls were a central theme in the [[Minoan civilization]], with bull heads and bull horns used as symbols in the [[Knossos]] palace. Minoan [[fresco]]s and [[ceramic]]s depict [[bull-leaping]], in which participants of both sexes vaulted over bulls by grasping their horns.

===Iran===
The [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]] texts and traditions of [[Zoroastrianism]] have several different mythological bovine creatures. One of these is [[Gavaevodata]], which is the [[Avestan]] name of a [[Hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] "uniquely created (''-aevo.data'') cow (''gav-'')", one of [[Ahura Mazda]]'s six primordial material creations that becomes the mythological progenitor of all beneficent animal life. Another Zoroastrian mythological bovine is Hadhayans, a gigantic bull so large that it could straddle the mountains and seas that divide the [[Karshvar|seven regions of the earth]], and on whose back men could travel from one region to another. In medieval times, Hadhayans also came to be known as Srīsōk (Avestan *''Thrisaok'', "three burning places"), which derives from a legend in which three [[Fire temple#Legendary Great Fires|"Great Fires"]] were collected on the creature's back. Yet another mythological bovine is that of the unnamed creature in the ''Cow's Lament'', an allegorical hymn attributed to [[Zoroaster]] himself, in which the soul of a bovine (''geush urvan'') despairs over her lack of protection from an adequate herdsman. In the allegory, the cow represents humanity's lack of moral guidance, but in later Zoroastrianism, Geush Urvan became a [[yazata]] representing [[cattle]]. The 14th day of the month is named after her and is under her protection.

===South Asia===
Bulls also appear on seals from the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]].

[[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] appears in [[Hindu mythology]] as the primary vehicle and the principal ''gana'' (follower) of [[Shiva]].

In Rig Veda, Indra was often praised as a Bull (Vrsabha – 'vrsa' means he and bha means being or uksan- a bull aged five to nine years, which is still growing or just reached its full growth), with bull being an icon of power and virile strength not just in Aryan literature but in many IE cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1000910/Sanskrit_v_rsabh%C3%A1-_Greek_%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%83%CE%B7%CE%BD_%CE%B5%CF%81%CF%83%CE%B7%CE%BD_the_spraying_bull_of_Indo-European url]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyprus===
In [[Cyprus]], bull masks made from real skulls were worn in rites. Bull-masked terracotta figurines&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and Neolithic bull-horned stone altars have been found in Cyprus.

===Levant===
The [[Canaan]]ite (and later [[Carthage|Carthaginian]]) statue to which sacrifices were burnt, either as a deity or a type of sacrifice – [[Moloch]] – was referred to as a horned man, and likened to Cronus by the Romans. There may be a connection between sacrifice to the [[Crete|Cretan]] horned man [[Minotaur]] and Cronus' himself.  Both [[Baʿal]] and [[El (deity)|El]] were associated with the bull in Ugaritic texts, as it symbolized both strength and fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Miller |first=Patrick |date=2000 |title=Israelite Religion and Biblical Theology: Collected Essays |publisher=Continuum Int'l Publishing Group |isbn=1-84127-142-X|page=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cronus' son [[Zeus]] was raised on Crete in hiding from his father. Having consumed all of his own children (the gods) Cronus is fed a boulder by Zeus (to represent Zeus' own body so he appears consumed) and an emetic. His vomiting of the boulder and subsequently the other gods (his children) in the [[Titanomachy]] bears comparison with the volcanic eruption that appears to be described in Zeus' battle with Typhon in the ''[[Theogony]]''. Consequently, Cronus may be associated with the eruption of [[Thera]] through the myth of his defeat by Zeus. The later association between Canaanite religions in which child sacrifice took place [http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-25.htm Ezek. 20:25][http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-26.htm -26] and the association of child sacrifice with a horned god (as potentially on Crete and certainly in Carthage) may also be connected with the Greek myth of sending young men and women to the [[Minotaur]], a bull-headed man.

[http://biblelexicon.org/exodus/32-4.htm Exodus 32:4] "He took this from their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool and made it into a molten calf; and they said, 'This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt'."

[http://biblelexicon.org/exodus/32-4.htm Nehemiah 9:18] "even when they made an idol shaped like a calf and said, 'This is your god who brought you out of Egypt!' They committed terrible blasphemies."

Calf-idols are referred to later in the [[Tanakh]], such as in the [[Book of Hosea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/hosea/10-5.htm |title=Hosea 10:5 The people who live in Samaria fear for the calf-idol of Beth Aven. Its people will mourn over it, and so will its idolatrous priests, those who had rejoiced over its splendor, because it is taken from them into exile |publisher=Bible.cc |date= |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would seem accurate as they were a fixture of near-eastern cultures.

[[Solomon]]'s "[[Molten Sea]]" basin stood on twelve brazen bulls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/1_kings/7-25.htm |title=1 Kings 7:25 The Sea stood on twelve bulls, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south and three facing east. The Sea rested on top of them, and their hindquarters were toward the center |publisher=Bible.cc |date= |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/jeremiah/52-20.htm |title=Jeremiah 52:20 The bronze from the two pillars, the Sea and the twelve bronze bulls under it, and the movable stands, which King Solomon had made for the temple of the LORD, was more than could be weighed |publisher=Bible.cc |date= |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young bulls were set as frontier markers at [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]] and [[Bethel]], the frontiers of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]].

Much later, in [[Abrahamic religions]], the bull motif became a bull [[demon]] or the "horned devil" in contrast and conflict to earlier traditions. The bull is familiar in [[Judeo-Christian]] cultures from the [[Biblical]] episode wherein an [[idolatry|idol]] of the [[golden calf]] (({{lang-he|עֵגֶּל הַזָהָב}}) is made by [[Aaron]] and worshipped by the Hebrews in the wilderness of the Sinai Peninsula ([[Book of Exodus]]). The text of the [[Hebrew Bible]] can be understood to refer to the idol as representing a separate god, or as representing [[Yahweh]] himself, perhaps through an association or [[religious syncretism]] with Egyptian or [[Levant]]ine bull gods, rather than a new deity in itself.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Greece===
[[File:1615 Jordaens Rape of Europa anagoria.JPG|thumb|''The Rape of Europa'', [[Jacob Jordaens]], 1615]]
[[File:The Abduction of Europa, Jean-François de Troy.jpg|thumb|''The Rape of Europa'', [[Jean François de Troy]], 1716]]

Among the [[Twelve Olympians]], [[Hera]]'s [[epithet]] ''Bo-opis'' is usually translated "ox-eyed" Hera, but the term could just as well apply if the goddess had the head of a cow, and thus the epithet reveals the presence of an earlier, though not necessarily more primitive, iconic view. ([[Heinrich Schlieman]], 1976) Classical Greeks never otherwise referred to Hera simply as the cow, though her priestess [[Io (mythology)|Io]] was so literally a heifer that she was stung by a gadfly, and it was in the form of a heifer that [[Zeus]] coupled with her. Zeus took over the earlier roles, and, in the form of a bull that came forth from the sea, abducted the high-born Phoenician [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] and brought her, significantly, to Crete.

[[Dionysus]] was another god of resurrection who was strongly linked to the bull. In a worship hymn from [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], at a festival for Hera, [[Dionysus]] is also invited to come as a bull, "with bull-foot raging." "Quite frequently he is portrayed with bull horns, and in [[Cyzicus|Kyzikos]] he has a tauromorphic image," [[Walter Burkert]] relates, and refers also to an archaic myth in which Dionysus is slaughtered as a bull calf and impiously eaten by the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1985 pp. 64, 132&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Greeks, the bull was strongly linked to the [[Cretan Bull]]: [[Theseus]] of Athens had to capture the ancient sacred bull of [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]] (the ''"Marathonian bull"'') before he faced the [[Minotaur]] (Greek for ''"Bull of Minos"''), who the Greeks imagined as a man with the head of a bull at the center of the [[labyrinth]]. Minotaur was fabled to be born of the Queen and a bull, bringing the king to build the labyrinth to hide his family's shame. Living in solitude made the boy wild and ferocious, unable to be tamed or beaten. Yet [[Walter Burkert]]'s constant warning is, "It is hazardous to project Greek tradition directly into the [[Bronze Age]]."&lt;ref&gt;Burkert 1985 p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Only one Minoan image of a bull-headed man has been found, a tiny [[Minoan sealstone]] currently held in the Archaeological Museum of [[Chania]].

In the Classical period of Greece, the bull and other animals identified with deities were separated as their ''agalma'', a kind of heraldic show-piece that concretely signified their numinous presence.

===Roman Empire===
[[File:BritishMuseumMithras.jpg|thumb|[[Tauroctony]] of Mithras at the [[British Museum]], London.]]
[[File:FaneBull.jpg|thumb|Bull used as a heraldic crest, here for the Fane family, [[Earls of Westmorland]]. (Great Britain, this example 18th or 19th century, but inherited early 17th century from a much earlier use of the idiom by the [[Ralph de Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland|Neville]] family).]]

The religious practices of the [[Roman Empire]] of the 2nd to 4th centuries included the ''[[taurobolium]]'', in which a bull was sacrificed for the well being of the people and the state. Around the mid-2nd century, the practice became identified with the worship of [[Magna Mater]], but was not previously associated only with that cult ([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#cultus|''cultus'']]). Public taurobolia, enlisting the benevolence of Magna Mater on behalf of the emperor, became common in Italy and Gaul, Hispania and Africa. The last public taurobolium for which there is an inscription was carried out at [[Maktar|Mactar in Numidia]] at the close of the 3rd century. It was performed in honor of the emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]].

Another Roman [[mystery cult]] in which a sacrificial bull played a role was that of the 1st–4th century [[Mithraic Mysteries]]. In the so-called "[[tauroctony]]" artwork of that cult ([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#cultus|''cultus'']]), and which appears in all its temples, the god [[Mithras]] is seen to slay a sacrificial bull. Although there has been a great deal of speculation on the subject, the myth (i.e. the "mystery", the understanding of which was the basis of the cult) that the scene was intended to represent remains unknown. Because the scene is accompanied by a great number of astrological allusions, the bull is generally assumed to represent the constellation of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. The basic elements of the tauroctony scene were originally associated with [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the Greek goddess of victory.

[[Macrobius]] lists the bull as an animal sacred to the god [[Neto (deity)|Neto/Neito]], possibly being sacrifices to the deity.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'', Book I, XIX&lt;/ref&gt;

===Celts===
A prominent zoomorphic deity type is the divine bull. [[Tarvos Trigaranus]] ("bull with three cranes") is pictured on reliefs from the cathedral at [[Trier]], [[Germany]], and at [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]] de [[Paris]]. In [[Irish mythology]], the [[Donn Cuailnge]] plays a central role in the epic ''[[Táin Bó Cúailnge]]'' ("The [[Cattle raiding|Cattle Raid]] of Cooley"), which features the hero [[Cú Chulainn]], which were collected in the seventh century ''[[Lebor na hUidre]]'' ("Book of the Dun Cow").

[[Pliny the Elder]], writing in the first century, describes a religious ceremony in [[Gaul]] in which white-clad [[druid]]s climbed a sacred [[oak]], cut down the [[Viscum album|mistletoe]] growing on it, sacrificed two white bulls and used the mistletoe to cure infertility:&lt;ref name="GreenExploring18-19"&gt;Miranda J. Green. (2005) ''Exploring the world of the druids.'' London: Thames &amp; Hudson. {{ISBN|0-500-28571-3}}. Page 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The druids — that is what they call their magicians — hold nothing more sacred than the mistletoe and a tree on which it is growing, provided it is [[Quercus macrolepis|Valonia oak]]…. Mistletoe is rare and when found it is gathered with great ceremony, and particularly on the [[lunar phase|sixth day of the moon]]….Hailing the [[moon]] in a native word that means ‘[[panacea|healing all things]],’ they prepare a ritual [[sacrifice]] and [[banquet]] beneath a tree and bring up two white bulls, whose [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s are bound for the first time on this occasion. A [[priest]] arrayed in white [[vestment]]s climbs the tree and, with a golden [[sickle]], cuts down the mistletoe, which is caught in a white [[cloak]]. Then finally they kill the victims, praying to a [[deity|god]] to render his gift propitious to those on whom he has bestowed it. They believe that mistletoe given in drink will impart fertility to any animal that is barren and that it is an [[antidote]] to all poisons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natural History (Pliny)]], XVI, 95&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Medieval and modern and other uses==
The practice of [[bullfighting]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[southern France]] are connected with the legends of [[Saturnin]] of [[Toulouse]] and his protégé in [[Pamplona]], [[Fermin]]. These are inseparably linked to bull-sacrifices by the vivid manner of their martyrdoms set by Christian [[hagiography]] in the third century.

In some Christian traditions, [[Nativity scene#Animals in nativity scenes|Nativity scene]]s are carved or assembled at [[Christmas]] time.  Many show a bull or an [[ox]] near the baby [[Jesus]], lying in a manger. Traditional songs of Christmas often tell of the bull and the donkey warming the infant with their breath. This refers (or, at least, is referred) to the beginning of the book of the prophet Isaiah, where he says: "The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib." (Isaiah 1:3)

[[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] ([[Latin]] for "the Bull") is one of the [[constellation]]s of the [[zodiac]], which means it is crossed by the plane of the [[ecliptic]]. Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the [[northern hemisphere]]'s winter sky. It is one of the oldest constellations, dating back to at least the [[Early Bronze Age]] when it marked the location of the Sun during the spring [[equinox]]. Its importance to the agricultural calendar influenced various bull figures in the mythologies of Ancient [[Sumerian religion|Sumer]], [[Akkadian religion|Akkad]], [[Assyrian religion|Assyria]], [[Babylonian religion|Babylon]], [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egypt]], [[Ancient Greek religion|Greece]], and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Rome]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2443">'''Sidney Hollis Radner''' (December 8, 1919 &amp;ndash; June 26, 2011) was a retired rug salesman from [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]], who owned one of the world's largest and most valuable collections of [[Harry Houdini]] artifacts. Radner was a 1937 graduate of [[Worcester Academy]] and matriculated to [[Yale College]].

==Biography==
He was born on December 8, 1919 and attended [[Yale University]].

Houdini's brother [[Theodore Hardeen]] considered Radner as his [[protégé]]. Hardeen died in June 1945, willed most of Houdini's collection to Radner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Dean E.|last= Murphy|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=In Sadness, Prime Houdini Artifact Collector Puts Items on Auction Block |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F05EEDA133DF93AA15753C1A9629C8B63&amp;sec=travel&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |quote=... Mr. Radner, aka Rendar the Magician, owns one of the world's biggest and most valuable collections of Harry Houdini artifacts, including the Chinese Water Torture Cell, one of Houdini's signature props from 1912 until his death in 1926. Most of the items were given to Mr. Radner in the 1940s by Houdini's brother, another escape artist who went by the stage name Hardeen. Hardeen considered Mr. Radner, then a student at Yale with a reputation for jumping from diving boards in handcuffs, as his protégé. Until early this year, the collection was on display at the Outagamie Museum in Appleton, Wis., where Houdini's father was the town rabbi in the 1870s. But after a rancorous falling out between Mr. Radner and museum officials, the 1,000-piece collection was packed up and shipped here, where it will be auctioned on Saturday in the windowless back room at the Liberace Museum and on eBay. ...  |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=October 29, 2004 |accessdate=2007-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spider-Man''''' is a 2002 American [[superhero film]] directed by [[Sam Raimi]], based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character of [[Spider-Man|the same name]] and the first installment in the [[Spider-Man in film#Sam Raimi films|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]]. The film stars [[Tobey Maguire]] as [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], a high school student living in [[New York City]], who lives a double life as the superhero Spider-Man, after developing spider-like super powers. ''Spider-Man'' also stars [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[James Franco]], [[Cliff Robertson]] and [[Rosemary Harris]].

After progress on the film stalled for nearly 25 years, it was licensed for a worldwide release by [[Columbia Pictures]] in 1999 after it acquired options from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] on all previous scripts developed by [[The Cannon Group|Cannon Films]], [[Carolco Pictures|Carolco]] and [[The Cannon Group, Inc.#1990–1994: Relaunch and demise|New Cannon]]. Exercising its option on just two elements from the multi-script acquisition (a different screenplay was written by [[James Cameron]], [[Ted Newsom]], [[John Brancato]], Barney Cohen and [[Menahem Golan|Joseph Goldman]]), Sony hired [[David Koepp]] to create a working screenplay (credited as Cameron's), and Koepp received sole credit in final billing. Directors [[Roland Emmerich]], [[Ang Lee]], [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], [[Jan de Bont]], [[M. Night Shyamalan]], [[Tony Scott]] and [[David Fincher]] were considered to direct the project before Raimi was hired as director in 2000. The Koepp script was rewritten by [[Scott Rosenberg]] during pre-production and received a dialogue polish from [[Alvin Sargent]] during production. Filming took place in [[Los Angeles]] and New York City from January 8 to June 30, 2001.

''Spider-Man'' premiered in the [[Philippines]] on April 30, 2002 and had its general release in the United States on May 3, 2002. It became a critical and financial success: it was the first film to reach $100 million in a single weekend, and became the most successful film based on a comic book. With a box office gross of {{US$|821.7 million|long=no}} worldwide, it was 2002's [[2002 in film#Highest-grossing films|third-highest-grossing film]] and became the [[List of highest-grossing films|seventh-highest-grossing film of all time]]. The film went on to gross a total revenue of {{US$|1.5 billion|long=no}} from box office and [[home video]] sales.&lt;ref name="Botti"/&gt; The film competed at the [[75th Academy Awards]] ceremony for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]]. The film is credited for redefining the modern superhero genre, as well as the [[Blockbuster (entertainment)#Blockbuster films|summer blockbuster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/sam-raimi-spider-man-changed-superhero-movies/#poster|title=15 Years Later, Sam Raimi’s ‘Spider-Man’ Is Both a Trendsetter and a Throwback|work=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2014/05/03/spider-man-week-the-spidey-trailer-that-changed-the-game/|title=SPIDER-MAN WEEK: The Spidey trailer that changed the game|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=May 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2017/looking-back-sam-raimis-spider-man-is-still-definitive-15-years-later/|title=Looking Back: Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man' is Still Definitive 15 Years Later|work=FirstShowing.net|date=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://them0vieblog.com/2010/05/05/some-superhero-legacy-how-spider-man-changed-the-movies/|title=Some Superhero Legacy: How Spider-Man Changed the Movies…|work=The M0vie Blog|date=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and due to its success it was followed by two [[sequel]]s, ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (2004) and ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007).

==Plot==

High-school senior Peter Parker, a school outcast, lives with his aunt May and his uncle Ben. On a school field trip, he visits a genetics laboratory with his friend Harry Osborn and his love interest Mary Jane Watson. Peter is bitten by a genetically engineered "super spider". After arriving home, he becomes unconscious. Meanwhile, Harry's father, scientist Norman Osborn, a billionaire and the owner of Oscorp, is trying to win an important military contract. He experiments on himself with an unstable performance-enhancing chemical. After applying the chemical, he goes insane and kills his assistant, Dr. Stromm.

The next morning, Peter finds that he is no longer near-sighted, and his body has transformed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds that his hands can produce webs, and his quickened reflexes allow him to avoid injury during a confrontation with Flash Thompson. Peter discovers he has developed superhuman speed, strength, the ability to stick to surfaces, and a heightened ability to sense danger.

Ignoring Ben's advice that "With great power comes great responsibility", Peter plans to buy a car to impress Mary Jane. He participates in an underground fighting tournament and wins his match, but the promoter cheats him and refuses to pay him the reward money. When a robber suddenly raids the promoter's office, Peter allows him to escape with the money. Moments later, he discovers that Ben was carjacked and killed. Peter pursues and catches the culprit, only to find out that was the robber he let go. During their confrontation, the robber trips and falls out of a window to his death. Meanwhile, a crazed Norman interrupts a military experiment by Oscorp's rival, using a weaponized glider from Oscorp's research and development department to kill several scientists and the military's General Slocum.

Upon graduating, Peter begins using his abilities for a good cause to atone for his uncle's death, donning the costume of Spider-Man. J. Jonah Jameson, a newspaper company headmaster, hires Peter as a freelance photographer since he is the only one providing high-quality images of Spider-Man.

Learning that Oscorp's board members plan to fire him and sell the company, Norman takes the glider and a specialized flight suit to assassinate them at the World Unity Fair. Jameson dubs the mysterious killer "the Green Goblin", based on the suit's color and the mask that Norman dons. During his encounters with Spider-Man, Norman proposes that he join him in chaotic and destructive schemes, arguing that the public will eventually turn against a hero, but Peter refuses. They later fight, and Peter is wounded. At the Thanksgiving dinner, May invites Mary Jane, Harry, and Norman. There, Norman sees the wound on Peter's arm and realizes his true identity. Shortly after he leaves, Norman attacks and hospitalizes May.

Mary Jane admits she is infatuated with Spider-Man, who has rescued her twice, and asks Peter whether Spider-Man ever asked about her. Harry, who is dating Mary Jane, arrives and presumes she has feelings for Peter after seeing them hold hands. Devastated, Harry tells his father that Peter loves Mary Jane, unintentionally revealing Spider-Man's biggest weakness.

Norman holds Mary Jane and a Roosevelt Island Tram car full of children hostage alongside the Queensboro Bridge. He forces Peter to choose whom he wants to save before dropping Mary Jane and the children. Peter manages to save both Mary Jane and the tram car, while Norman is pelted by the civilians. Norman then grabs Peter and throws him into an abandoned building, where Peter is brutally beaten. When Norman rants about how he will kill Mary Jane, an enraged Peter overpowers Norman.

Norman reveals himself to Peter, much to Peter's shock. He begs for forgiveness but furtively controls his glider to attack Peter. Sensing the danger, Peter dodges the glider and it impales Norman, killing him. As Norman dies, he begs Peter not to tell Harry the truth of his identity. Peter takes Norman's body back to his house. Harry arrives to find Spider-Man standing over his father's body. He seizes a gun to shoot Spider-Man, but he escapes and hides Norman's equipment.

At Norman's funeral, Harry vows to kill Spider-Man, whom he deems responsible for his father's death. He asserts that Peter is all the family he has left. Mary Jane confesses to Peter that she is in love with him. However, Peter feels that he must protect her from the unwanted attention of his enemies. He hides his true feelings and tells Mary Jane that they can only be friends. As Peter leaves, he recalls Ben's words and accepts his new responsibility as a superhero - Spider-Man.

[[Bruce Campbell]], a long-time colleague of director [[Sam Raimi]], has a cameo as the announcer at the wrestling ring Peter takes part in. Years later, Jeffrey Henderson, who worked on the storyboards for the cancelled ''Spider-Man 4'' movie, released information regarding which villains would appear within the movie. One of those included Bruce Campbell's character's progression into Quentin Beck / Mysterio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planethenderson.com/storyboards/#/spiderman4/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.gizmodo.com/spider-man-4-storyboards-reveal-iconic-villains-and-hug-1779949984]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ted Raimi]], Sam Raimi's actor brother, plays a small role as editor's assistant "Hoffman".

===Development===
{{Details|Spider-Man in film#Development}}
In April 1999, although [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]] optioned from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] all preceding script versions of a ''Spider-Man'' film, it only exercised the options on "the Cameron material," which contractually included a multi-author screenplay and a forty-five page "[[scriptment]]" credited only to [[James Cameron]]. The studio announced they were not hiring Cameron himself to direct the film nor would they be using his script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Daniel |last=Frankel |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b37970_Cameron_Spun_Out_of_Spider-Man_Movie.html |title=Cameron Spun Out of Spider-Man Movie |publisher=[[E!]] |date=April 5, 1999 |accessdate=2010-11-05 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u0xRRQoB?url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b37970_Cameron_Spun_Out_of_Spider-Man_Movie.html |archivedate=November 5, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio lined up [[Roland Emmerich]], [[Tony Scott]], [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], [[Ang Lee]], [[David Fincher]], [[Jan de Bont]] and [[M. Night Shyamalan]] as potential directors. Fincher did not want to depict the [[origin story]], pitching the film as being based on ''[[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]]'' storyline, but the studio disagreed.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; [[Sam Raimi]] was attached to direct in January 2000,&lt;ref name="ahead"&gt;{{cite news | author=Robert K.

Cameron's work became the basis of [[David Koepp]]'s first draft screenplay, often word for word.&lt;ref name="Hiltzik"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/24/magazine/tm-34460/2 | first=Michael A. |last= Hiltzik | title=Untangling the Web | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] Magazine | date=March 24, 2002|page=2 of online version|archivedate= March 4, 2016| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100601/http://articles.latimes.com/2002/mar/24/magazine/tm-34460| deadurl=no|quote= Of the four writers Columbia lists as contributors to the final 'Spider-Man' script, three — Cameron, Scott Rosenberg and Alvin Sargent — voluntarily ceded sole credit to the fourth, Koepp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron's versions of the Marvel villains Electro and Sandman remained the antagonists. Koepp's rewrite substituted the [[Green Goblin]] as the main antagonist and added [[Doctor Octopus]] as the secondary antagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gross |first= Edward |title= Spider-Man Confidential |pages=208–209 |publisher=[[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]] |date=May 2002 |isbn= 0-7868-8722-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Raimi felt the Green Goblin and the surrogate father-son theme between Norman Osborn and Peter Parker would be more interesting, thus, he dropped Doctor Octopus from the film.&lt;ref name="trivia track"&gt;{{cite video | title = Subtitled Factoids: Weaving the Web | format = DVD | publisher = Sony |date = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Columbia hired [[Scott Rosenberg]] to rewrite Koepp's material. Remaining a constant in all the rewrites was the "organic webshooter" idea from the Cameron "scriptment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gross |first= Edward |title= Spider-Man Confidential |pages=206–208 |publisher=[[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion]] |date=May 2002 |isbn= 0-7868-8722-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Raimi felt he would stretch the audience's [[suspension of disbelief]] too far to have Peter invent mechanical webshooters.&lt;ref name="friday"/&gt;

Rosenberg removed Doctor Octopus and created several new action sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Claude| last=Brodesser | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117782713.html | title='Spider-Man' snares scribe | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=June 16, 2000 | accessdate=2007-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Raimi felt adding a third origin story would make the film too complex. Sequences removed from the final film had Spider-Man protecting Fargas, the wheelchair-using Oscorp executive, from the Goblin, and Spider-Man defusing a hostage situation on a train.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; As production neared, producer [[Laura Ziskin]] hired her husband, award-winning writer [[Alvin Sargent]], to polish the dialogue, primarily between Peter and Mary Jane.&lt;ref name="greg"&gt;{{cite web | author=[[Greg Dean Schmitz]] | title=Greg's Preview - Spider-Man | publisher=[[Yahoo!]] | url=https://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&amp;cf=prev&amp;id=1808406011&amp;gpt=ch | accessdate=2008-08-09 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429050554/http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&amp;cf=prev&amp;id=1808406011&amp;gpt=ch | archivedate=2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia gave the [[Writers Guild of America]] a list of four writers as contributors to the final ''Spider-Man'' script: Rosenberg, Sargent and James Cameron, all three of whom voluntarily relinquished credit to the fourth, Koepp.&lt;ref name="Hiltzik"/&gt;

===Filming===
With ''Spider-Man'' cast, filming was set to begin the following November in [[New York City]] and on Sony [[soundstage]]s. The film was set for release a year later,&lt;ref name="spins" /&gt; but when the film was postponed to be released on May 3, 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034459p1.html | title=''Spider-Man'' Crawls Into 2002 | publisher=IGN | date=September 14, 2000 | accessdate=2007-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; filming officially began on January 8, 2001&lt;ref name="greg"/&gt; in [[Culver City, California]]. After the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001]], certain sequences were re-filmed, and images of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|Twin Towers]] were digitally erased from the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.com/news/item/5226/spider-man-twin-tower-trailers-scrapped.phtml|title=Spider Man Twin Tower Trailers Scrapped|publisher=|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/10170|title=W.T.C. to be Digitally Removed From SPIDER-MAN|author=staff|date=September 13, 2001|work=Aint It Cool News|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony's Stage 29 was used for Peter's [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] home, and Stage 27 was used for the wrestling sequence where Peter takes on Bonesaw McGraw ([[Randy Savage]]). Stage 27 was also used for the complex [[Times Square]] sequence where Spider-Man and the Goblin battle for the first time, where a three-story set with a breakaway balcony piece was built. The scene also required shooting in [[Downey, California]].&lt;ref name="booklet"&gt;DVD Booklet (2002), p.2–3&lt;/ref&gt; On March 6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1555976.stm|title=Wife sues over Spider-Man death|publisher=BBC News|date=September 21, 2001|accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 45-year-old construction worker Tim Holcombe was killed when a forklift modified as a construction crane crashed into a construction basket that he was in. The following court case led to the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health to fine Sony $58,805.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Columbia Fined For Safety Violation That Led To Death | publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]] | date = August 27, 2001 | url = https://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2001-08-27#film2 | accessdate = 2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Los Angeles]], locations included the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|Natural History Museum]] (for the [[Columbia University]] lab where Peter is bitten and receives his powers), the Pacific Electricity Building (the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' offices) and [[Greystone Mansion]] (for the interiors of Norman Osborn's home). In April, 4 of the Spider-Man costumes were stolen, and Sony put up a $25,000 reward for their return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = They Took Spidey's Clothes! | publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]] | date=April 5, 2001 | url = https://www.imdb.com/news/sb/2001-04-05#film3 | accessdate=2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were recovered after 18 months and a former movie studio security guard and an accomplice were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 7 Bizarre Stories of Stolen Movie Props | publisher = [[Mental Floss]] | date=June 16, 2010 | url = http://mentalfloss.com/article/24937/7-bizarre-stories-stolen-movie-props | accessdate=2013-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production moved to New York City for two weeks, taking in locations such as the [[Queensboro Bridge]], the exteriors of Columbia University's [[Low Memorial Library]] and the [[New York Public Library]], and a rooftop garden in the [[Rockefeller Center]].&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt; The crew returned to Los Angeles where production and filming ended in June. The [[Flatiron Building]] was used for the ''Daily Bugle''.&lt;ref name="greg"/&gt;

===Design===
[[File:OriginalGreenGoblin.jpg|thumb|The original animatronic headgear for the Green Goblin was created by [[Amalgamated Dynamics]]]]
Before settling on the look used in the film, the original headgear created for the Green Goblin was an animatronic mask created by Amalgamated Dynamics. The design was much more faithful to the comics than the finished product, and allowed for a full range of emotions to be expressed by the wearer. Ultimately, the mask was scrapped before an actor was chosen to play the Green Goblin,  and a static helmet was produced for the film instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parker |first1=Ryan |title='Spider-Man': Willem Dafoe's Original Green Goblin Mask Was Amazing |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/spider-man-willem-dafoes-original-green-goblin-mask-was-amazing-1019532 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lammers |first1=Timothy |title=Spider-Man's Green Goblin Mask Was Originally Far More Comic Accurate |url=https://screenrant.com/raimi-spider-man-green-goblin-accurate-mask-dafoe/ |website=Screen Rant |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it wound up being faithful to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer [[James Acheson]] became fond of was the idea of having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going down the sides of the legs.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Josh| last=Tyrangiel | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,997713,00.html?promoid=googlep | title=He has radioactive blood, now about those pecs | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=August 14, 2000 | accessdate=2007-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed as a single piece, including the mask. A hard shell was worn underneath the mask to make the shape of the head look better and to keep the mask tight while keeping the wearer comfortable.  For scenes where he would take his mask off, there was an alternate suit where the mask was a separate piece. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=KJB | title=Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man Update | publisher=IGN | date=January 13, 2001 | url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/034/034485p1.html | accessdate=2007-04-28 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311105354/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/034/034485p1.html | archivedate=March 11, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visual effects===
Visual effects supervisor [[John Dykstra]] was hired to produce the film's visual effects in May 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Scott| last=Chitwood | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034448p1.html | title=Dykstra to animate Spider-Man | publisher=IGN | date=May 10, 2000 | accessdate=2007-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He convinced Raimi to make many of the stunts [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]], as they would have been physically impossible. Raimi had used more traditional special effects in his previous films and learned a lot about using computers during production.&lt;ref name="HBO"/&gt; Raimi worked hard to plan all the sequences of Spider-Man swinging from buildings, which he described as, "[[ballet]] in the sky." The complexity of such sequences meant the budget rose from an initially planned $70&amp;nbsp;million to around $100&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="empire"/&gt; Shots were made more complicated because of the main characters' individual color schemes, so Spider-Man and the Green Goblin had to be shot separately for effects shots: Spider-Man was shot in front of a [[greenscreen]], while the Green Goblin was shot against bluescreen. Shooting them together would have resulted in one character being erased from a shot.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt;

Dykstra said the biggest difficulty of creating Spider-Man was that as the character was masked, it immediately lost a lot of characterization. Without the context of eyes or mouth, a lot of body language had to be put in so that there would be emotional content. Raimi wanted to convey the essence of Spider-Man as being, "the transition that occurs between him being a young man going through puberty and being a superhero." Dykstra said his crew of animators had never reached such a level of sophistication to give subtle hints of still making Spider-Man feel like a human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Phillip| last=Zonkel | title=Spinning `Spider-Man's' Visual Effects Web -- Former CSULB Student John Dykstra Is Credited with a Great Deal of Computer-Generated Movie Magic | work=[[Press-Telegram (Long Beach)|Press-Telegram]]| location=[[Long Beach, California]] | date=March 20, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; When two studio executives were shown shots of the computer generated character, they believed it was actually Maguire performing stunts.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; In addition, Dykstra's crew had to composite areas of New York City and replaced every car in shots with digital models. Raimi did not want it to feel entirely like animation, so none of the shots were 100% computer-generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Rob| last = Worley | title = Comics 2 Film | publisher = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = March 6, 2002 | url = http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=comics2film&amp;article=1259 | accessdate=2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
[[File:Bannedposter.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Original ''Spider-Man'' teaser poster, which was recalled from theatres following [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] (the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] is reflected in Spider-Man's eyes)]]
After the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001]], Sony had to recall teaser posters which showed a close-up of Spider-Man's face with the New York skyline (including, prominently, the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] towers) reflected in his eyes. The film's original [[Teaser campaign|teaser trailer]], released in 2001 and shown before ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'', ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'', ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'', and ''[[American Pie 2]]'', featured a mini-film plot involving a group of bank robbers escaping in a [[Eurocopter Fennec|Eurocopter AS355 Twin Squirrel]] helicopter, which gets caught from behind and propelled backward into what at first appears to be a net, then is shown to be a gigantic spider web spun between the World Trade Center towers. According to Sony, the trailer did not contain any actual footage from the film itself and is consequently one of the most popular "Special Shoot" trailers since ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Gumbel |title=Spider-Man Caught up in New York Destruction |publisher=Pretoria News |date=September 14, 2001 |url=http://www.pretorianews.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=&amp;fArticleId=qw10004699418S351 |accessdate=2010-11-05 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u0wrMxvW?url=http://www.pretorianews.co.za/index.php?fSectionId=&amp;fArticleId=qw10004699418S351 |archivedate=November 5, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer and poster were pulled after the events of the attacks, but can be found on the internet on websites such as YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = KJB | title = Sony Pulls Spider-Man Teaser Trailer &amp; Poster | publisher = IGN | date = September 13, 2001 | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/305/305861p1.html | accessdate = 2007-04-28 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120209125330/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/305/305861p1.html | archivedate = February 9, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the film's British theatrical release in June 2002, the [[British Board of Film Classification]] (BBFC) gave the film a "12" certificate. Due to ''Spider-Man''{{'}}s popularity with younger children, this prompted much controversy. The BBFC defended its decision, arguing that the film could have been given a "15". Despite this, North Norfolk and Breckland District Councils, in East Anglia, changed it to a "PG", and Tameside council, [[Manchester]], denoted it a "PG-12". The U.S. rated it "PG-13"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Parents warned of Spider-Man violence|publisher=BBC|date=June 13, 2002|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2042729.stm|accessdate=2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for "stylized violence and action". In late August, the BBFC relaxed its policy to "12A", leading Sony to re-release the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Film ratings for children relaxed|publisher=BBC|date=August 29, 2002|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2222009.stm|accessdate=2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case study from the British Board of Film Classification|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/case-studies/spider-man|publisher=British Board of Film Classification |accessdate =December 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Spider-Man'' currently ranks as the [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|29th-highest-grossing film of all time]] in the U.S. and Canada, not adjusted for inflation. The film also grossed $418,002,176 from its international markets, bringing its worldwide total to $821,708,551,&lt;ref name=BOMtickets/&gt; making it 2002's third-highest-grossing film behind ''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' and the 58th-highest-grossing film of all time, worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/|title=All Time Worldwide Box Office Grosses|work=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film sold an estimated 69,484,700 tickets in the US.&lt;ref name=BOMtickets&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spiderman.htm&amp;adjust_yr=1&amp;p=.htm | title=Spider-Man (2002)| publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] | accessdate=July 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It held the record for most tickets sold by a comic book movie until ''The Dark Knight'' topped it in 2008.

Only ''Avengers: Infinity War'', ''The Dark Knight'', ''Black Panther'' and ''The Avengers'' have sold more tickets than ''Spider-Man''. ''Spider-Man'' was the highest-grossing superhero origin film, a record it held for 15 years until it was surpassed by ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=superheroorigin.htm|title=Superhero - Origin Movies at the Box Office|work=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the eighth-highest-grossing superhero film, as well as eighth-highest-grossing comic book adaptation in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=superhero.htm|title=Superhero Movies at the Box Office|work=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=comicbookadaptation.htm|title=Comic Book Adaptation Movies at the Box Office|work=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
On the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 90% based on 239 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Not only does ''Spider-Man'' provide a good dose of web-swinging fun, it also has a heart, thanks to the combined charms of director Sam Raimi and star Tobey Maguire."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spiderman/|title=Spider-Man (2002)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=August 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/spider-man|title=Spider-Man (2002): Reviews|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=September 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A–" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150405021357/http://m.cinemascore.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-04-05 |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The casting, mainly Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe and JK Simmons, is often cited as one of the film's high points. Eric Harrison, of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', was initially skeptical of the casting of Maguire, but, after seeing the film, he stated, "within seconds, however, it becomes difficult to imagine anyone else in the role."&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ae/movies/reviews/1394713.html | title=Harrison review | publisher=Houston Chronicle | accessdate=2007-01-23 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012144642/http://chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ae/movies/reviews/1394713.html | archivedate=2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'' critic Mike Clark believed the casting rivaled that of [[Christopher Reeve]] as 1978's ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]''.&lt;ref name="Mike Clark"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/2002/2002-05-03-spider-man.htm | title=Mike Clark review | work=[[USA Today]] | date=May 3, 2002 | accessdate=2007-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen Gleiberman, of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', had mixed feelings about the casting, particularly Tobey Maguire. "Maguire, winning as he is, never quite gets the chance to bring the two sides of Spidey—the boy and the man, the romantic and the avenger—together."&lt;ref name="Gleiberman"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,234775~1~0~spider-man,00.html | title=Entertainment Weekly review | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=May 1, 2002 | accessdate=2007-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Kirk Honeycutt thought, "the filmmakers' imaginations work in overdrive from the clever design of the cobwebby opening credits and Spider-Man and M.J.'s upside down kiss—after one of his many rescues of her—to a finale that leaves character relationships open ended for future adventures."&lt;ref name="Hollywood Reporter"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1468913|registration=yes| title=Hollywood Reporter review | publisher=Hollywood Report | date=April 19, 2002 | accessdate=2007-01-26 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503002707/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1468913 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; | archivedate=2007-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, ''[[LA Weekly]]''{{'s}} [[Manohla Dargis]] wrote, "It isn't that Spider-Man is inherently unsuited for live-action translation; it's just that he's not particularly interesting or, well, animated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dargis |first=Manohla |url=http://www.laweekly.com/film+tv/film/i-bug/3951/ |title=I, Bug |work=[[LA Weekly]] |accessdate=2009-05-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221160439/http://www.laweekly.com/film%2Btv/film/i-bug/3951/ |archivedate=December 21, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Giving it 2.5/4 stars, [[Roger Ebert]] felt the film lacked a decent action element; "Consider the scene where Spider-Man is given a cruel choice between saving Mary Jane or a cable car full of school kids. He tries to save both, so that everyone dangles from webbing that seems about to pull loose. The visuals here could have given an impression of the enormous weights and tensions involved, but instead the scene seems more like a bloodless storyboard of the idea."&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020503/REVIEWS/205030303/1023 | title=Roger Ebert review | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=May 3, 2002 | accessdate=2007-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stylistically, there was heavy criticism of the [[Green Goblin]]'s costume, which led IGN's Richard George to comment years later, "We're not saying the comic book costume is exactly thrilling, but the Goblin armor (the helmet in particular) from ''Spider-Man'' is almost comically bad... Not only is it not frightening, it prohibits expression."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Richard | last = George | title = Spider-Man in Film: Volume One | publisher = IGN | date = April 19, 2007 | url = http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/782/782199p3.html | accessdate = 2007-04-27 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071017233239/http://uk.comics.ign.com/articles/782/782199p3.html | archivedate = October 17, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' put "the kiss in ''Spider-Man''" on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list, saying, "There's a fine line between romantic and corny. And the rain-soaked smooch between Spider-Man and Mary Jane from 2002 tap-dances right on that line. The reason it works? Even if she suspects he's Peter Parker, she doesn't try to find out. And that's sexy."&lt;ref&gt;Geier, Thom; Jensen, Jeff; Jordan, Tina; Lyons, Margaret; Markovitz, Adam; Nashawaty, Chris; Pastorek, Whitney; Rice, Lynette; Rottenberg, Josh; Schwartz, Missy; Slezak, Michael; Snierson, Dan; Stack, Tim; Stroup, Kate; Tucker, Ken; Vary, Adam B.; Vozick-Levinson, Simon; Ward, Kate (December 11, 2009), "THE 100 Greatest Movies, Tv Shows, Albums, Books, Characters, Scenes, Episodes, Songs, Dresses, Music Videos, and Trends that Entertained Us over the Past 10 Years".". ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. (1079/1080):74-84&lt;/ref&gt; ''Empire'' magazine ranked ''Spider-Man'' 437 in its ''500 Greatest Movies of All Time'' list the following year.{{CN|date=February 2018}}

[[Little Green Men Games]] developed ''Starpoint Gemini 2'' based on the community feedback and suggestions in the Steam Early Access program. Although most of the popular suggestions made it in the game, some of the ideas could not be implemented in ''Starpoint Gemini 2''. The feature requests not suitable for ''Starpoint Gemini 2'' were kept on a wishlist and became the base of the new spin-off title ''Starpoint Gemini Warlords''. Just like its predecessor, ''Starpoint Gemini Warlords'' will go through Early Access where the developers intend to implement feature suggestions from their community and change the game according to their feedback. The game was scheduled to stay approximately 6 to 12 months in Steam Early Access and was finished and released after 11 months. &lt;ref name="SPGW_PCgamer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Livingston|first1=Christopher|title=How Early Access will shape Starpoint Gemini Warlords|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/how-early-access-will-shape-starpoint-gemini-warlords/|website=PCgamer|publisher=PCgamer|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="SPGW_BluesNews"&gt;{{cite web|title=Starpoint Gemini Warlords Early Access|url=https://www.bluesnews.com/cgi-bin/board.pl?action=viewthread&amp;boardid=1&amp;threadid=170795|website=Blue's News|publisher=Blue's News|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tamborera''' is a genre of Panamanian folk music.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su-9YecFwDw Panamanian Music History - Tamborito and Tamborera]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.pa/books?id=_yQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA18&amp;lpg=RA1-PA18&amp;dq=panamanian+tamborera&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0VOfsWAbdC&amp;sig=sqaPmsOWWq3km51NLTWGgv4KvqY&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Wm4QUdbbGI2v0AHhioHoDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=panamanian%20tamborera&amp;f=false Historical Article: Only the Best Survive by Willie Colon, mentioning the Panamanian Tamborera]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://indieflix.com/film/passage-to-panama-a-musical-journey-30381/ Passage to Panama: A Musical Journey]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a mixture of Panamanian [[Tamborito]] and Cuban [[Danzón]], created by the musician Ricardo Fabrega during the first half of the twentieth century.

==History of the Tamborera==
The Tamborera was created by Ricardo Fabrega&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.pa/books?id=cNEcEyZs254C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=panamanian+tamborera&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tXp5_9AiG5&amp;sig=2SONL9GaW9b1Anm6NR2BWeaPmlE&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Wm4QUdbbGI2v0AHhioHoDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=panamanian%20tamborera&amp;f=false Culture and Customs of Panama]&lt;/ref&gt; in the first half of the 20th century, to exalt nationalism and identify the Panamanians with their traditions.

This is recognized by journalist Ignacio Nacho Valdes, who said: "His compositions, of a deep romantic content, have the purpose of exalt the national soul of Panamanians, and therefore, through generations, our people have sung his songs sometimes with joy and often with a deep melancholy. "His music traveled to all corners of the country and internationally and has been the enjoyment of all classes

The Tamborera became known throughout Latin America with the famous song "Guararé" that is today part of the classics of Latin American music, with "Santiagueñita", "Chiricanita", "Agüita de canela", "Mi negro", "El filo", "Chichaco por los aires" and " Tan Bella y Presumida"

The genre gave life to real stars. Among these the most famous was Silvia De Grasse who brought her career to developing gender cusp outside the Panamanian border, especially in Puerto Rico, where she was recognized by the Puerto Rican television for her talent.

==Instrumentation==
Panamanian drums mixed: Repicador, Pujador and Caja, with instruments that are not part of the national foclore as organ, piano, electric guitar, trumpet, bass guitar and drums.

==Some Panamanian  Artists of Tamborera Music==
* Lucho Azcarraga
* Silvia De Grasse
* Avelino Muñoz Barrios

==Introduction to Venezuela==

The Panamanian Tamborera was introduced to [[Venezuela]] in the early 1970s, by the famous Gaitas singer Nelson Martinez with the group Gran Coquivacoa. His rhythm is 2x4 as the Panamanian tamborito, and was initially played with cuatro, furro, tambora, charrasca and maracas. Soon were added bass, piano, electric guitar, congas, bongos, cowbell and even brass (trumpet, trombone and saxophone) and drums. Since the late 70s and early 80s Gaitas Tamborera was influenced by Caribbean music, especially the Salsa.

===Instrumentation===
The most important instruments in tamborera music are the [[Percussion instrument|percussion]], which consist of several characteristic instruments: [[Tambora (drum)|tamboras]], furro, charrasca, and [[maraca]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldmusiccentral.org/article.php?story=20040412190223675 World Music Central - World Music Genres - Letter T&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Sambaballen.JPG|thumb|right|Maracas]]
Apart from percussion, other core instruments are the guitar and piano. Depending on the performing artist, other melodic instruments, such as the trumpets and trombones can be used as accompaniment as well. Tamborera music typically features a vocalist as well.

===Lyricism===
Tamborera lyrics are structured to include three verses and a chorus, with each line made up of eight syllables. Initially written about the daily life of people in nature, tamborera lyrics now range from simple phrases and words, like "tamborera" repeated with little creativity, to romantic love songs, to radical verses of protest.

===Rhythm===
Because of the tropical [[Caribbean music|Caribbean]] undertones of the tamborera, this genre is musically different from its ancestral [[Gaita Zuliana|gaita de tambora]] or [[gaita (disambiguation)|other gaitas]]. Tamborera music generally utilizes a 2/4 or 4/4 [[time signature]], but this is prone to waver with great usage of syncopation. The four [[percussion instrument]]s ([[Tambora (drum)|tamboras]], furro, charrasca, [[maraca]]s) layer several different rhythmic patterns together at the same time, but it is always the [[Tambora (drum)|tamboras]] that lay down the foundation of the tamborera by providing the main [[Beat (music)|beat]].

===Some Venezuelan  Artists of Tamborera Music===

*'''Jose Luis Moran'''
*'''Rozenda Bernal'''
*'''[[Gran Coquivacoa]]''' is a Venezuelan [[Gaita Zuliana]] group that released numerous albums featuring the tamborera as well as the [[Gaita Zuliana|gaita de tambora]].
*'''[[Guaco (band)|Guaco]]''', initially a [[Gaita Zuliana|gaita]] band from [[Maracaibo]], added a more tropical [[Afro-Cuban]] vibe to the tamborera. The group soon merged other genres like [[Pop music|pop]], [[jazz]], and [[funk]] to create a completely novel face to the genre.

'''The Tick''' is a fictional [[superhero]] created by cartoonist [[Ben Edlund]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/the-tick-creator-ben-edlund-and-co-showrunner-david-fury-spoon-out-a-binge-worthy-superhero | title= THE TICK CREATOR BEN EDLUND AND CO-SHOWRUNNER DAVID FURY ON MAKING A BINGE-WORTHY SUPERHERO | publisher = syfy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1986 as a [[newsletter]] [[mascot]] for the [[New England Comics]] chain of [[Boston]] area comic book stores. The character is a [[Parody|spoof]] of [[American comic book]] superheroes.

After its creation, the character spun off into an independent comic book series in 1988, and gained mainstream popularity through an [[The Tick (1994 TV series)|animated TV series]] on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in [[1994 in American television|1994]]. Two [[live-action]] TV series, a [[The Tick (video game)|video game]] and [[List of The Tick merchandise|various merchandise]] have also been based on the character. [[IGN]]'s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time ranked The Tick as #57.

==History==
In 1986, 18-year-old cartoonist [[Ben Edlund]] created The Tick as a mascot for a newsletter of the [[Norwood, Massachusetts]] store New England Comics where he was a customer. Edlund expanded this into stories, beginning with the three-page tale "The Tick" in ''New England Comics Newsletter'' #14–15 (July/August&amp;nbsp;– 
September/October 1986), in which the hero escapes from a [[mental institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/265658/|title=GCD :: Issue :: The Tick #1|website=www.comics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character became popular and the store financed a black-and-white comic book series, with the first issue released in June, 1988, and subsequently reprinted at least nine times through the next decade, including later editions with additional content. The Tick's [[sidekick]], [[Arthur (The Tick)|Arthur]], was introduced in ''The Tick'' #4 (April 1989).

Spin-offs followed featuring characters such as [[Paul the Samurai]], Man-Eating Cow, and [[Chainsaw Vigilante]]. Edlund continued to write and illustrate these projects initially through his years as an undergraduate film student at the [[Massachusetts College of Art]]. The ''Chainsaw Vigilante'' spin-off, which was never completed, was written and illustrated by [[Zander Cannon]]. Other series, such as the second ''Paul the Samurai'' series and the ''Man-Eating Cow'' series, were written by [[North Carolina]] writer Clay Griffith.

In 1994, the Fox network introduced ''The Tick'' as a [[Saturday morning cartoon]] series, which Edlund wrote and co-produced. Lasting three seasons, the animated series would provide The Tick's greatest mainstream fame. [[Townsend Coleman]] voiced the title character and [[Micky Dolenz]] played his sidekick Arthur, in season 1. [[Rob Paulsen]] took over the Arthur role during seasons 2 and 3. The series also featured Die Fledermaus, Sewer Urchin and American Maid. Reruns on [[Comedy Central]] helped make the series a [[cult following|cult hit]] with adults. The 1997 book ''The Tick: Mighty Blue Justice!'' by Greg Hyland (creator of [[Lethargic Lad]]) was published as a tie-in with the animated series.

In 2001, Fox introduced a live-action TV series (produced by [[Columbia TriStar Television]]), written and executive produced by Edlund. The series starred [[Patrick Warburton]] as The Tick, [[David Burke (American actor)|David Burke]] as Arthur, [[Nestor Carbonell]] as Batmanuel and [[Liz Vassey]] as Captain Liberty. The series was short lived, however, and it only lasted nine episodes. A [[DVD]] release of the complete series (including several unaired episodes) was released on September 30, 2003.
In June 2005, the [[Toon Disney]] network began airing ''The Tick'' animated series. The series also occasionally aired on [[ABC Family]] as part of the [[Jetix]] cartoon block. The following year, [[Buena Vista Home Entertainment]] released the first season of ''The Tick'' animated series on DVD. The second season was released on August 7, 2007; however, both collections were missing an episode for different reasons.

In July 2016, [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] announced that a new live-action ''The Tick'' series, starring [[Peter Serafinowicz]] and directed by [[Wally Pfister]], would air on [[Amazon Video]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/our-first-look-at-amazons-reboot-of-the-tick-1784034443|title=Our First Look at Amazon's Reboot of The Tick|first=James|last=Whitbrook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot was picked up as a series and the first half of episodes (6 of 12) in season one were released on August 25, 2017.  The second half of season one was released on February 23, 2018.

==Character biography==
{{also|List of The Tick characters}}
The Tick seems to have no memory of his life before being The Tick, and indeed not much memory of anything; more than likely due to [[Chronic_traumatic_encephalopathy|frequent head injuries.]] Each media adaption has a different origin of the Tick:
* In the original comic series, The Tick is apparently legally insane, having escaped from a mental institution located not too far from The City.
* In the 1994 animated series, he has passed his official superhero initiation test and was assigned to The City.
* In the 2001 live-action series. The Tick was tricked into moving to (and protecting) The City after irritating the employees of a remote bus station he had sworn to protect. He has no memory of his life before that, although Batmanuel suggests that The Tick may be from space.
* In the 2016 live-action series, The Tick has no memory of from where he comes, and his past has not yet been explained or uncovered. 

A square-jawed, muscular, bright blue-costumed figure with antennae sticking up from his head, The Tick is a surrealistic parody of superheroes, in the vein of [[Dave Sim]]'s character, [[The Cockroach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://homecinema.thedigitalfix.co.uk/content.php?contentid=62822 | title=The Tick vs. Season One | work=The Digital Fix | date=September 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://natstv.wordpress.com/2001/11/08/the-tick/ | title=The Tick | author=Gertler, Nat | date=November 8, 2001 | authorlink=Nat Gertler}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is well-intended, friendly, childlike, good-natured, high-spirited, bombastic, frequently obtuse, and prone to quipping odd, dim remarks and "inspirational" speeches filled with bizarre metaphors. The Tick is known for his nonsensical [[battle cry]], "Spoooooon!", which he decided upon one day while eating a bowl of Drama Flakes cereal. Actor Patrick Warburton described his perception of The Tick character, as Warburton played him:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tvcomedies.about.com/od/interviews/a/warburtonqa_2.htm | title=Patrick Warburton interview | author=Bell, Josh | work=[[About.com]] | accessdate=May 15, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908122919/http://tvcomedies.about.com/od/interviews/a/warburtonqa_2.htm | archivedate=September 8, 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|His past is a mystery. So everything that he looks at or perceives can be brand new, and he can get really, really excited and intrigued by something that’s just a commonality for everybody else, that’s humorous. He’s like a child; everything’s new. So you just bring that attitude to him, a childlike attitude of discovering things. | Patrick Warburton }}

Originally, The Tick's costume was meant to be brown, but it was decided that blue looked better in print. In ''The Tick vs. The Tick'', wherein The Tick is confronted by Barry, an unstable pseudo-hero who also calls himself "The Tick", Barry wears a brown costume similar to The Tick's. The Tick is named after an [[arachnid]], much like [[Spider-Man]]. The logo of the series also resembles that of the [[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|1994 Spider-Man series]]. According to the live-action series, The Tick is 6 feet 6&amp;nbsp;inches tall, weighs 230 pounds (6&amp;nbsp;inches and 170 pounds less than his dimensions in the comic), and has blue hair and eyes.

In the comic series, The Tick gets a job at the ''Weekly World Planet'' newspaper. He works in the same office as Clark Oppenheimer, who is also a superhero called the Caped Wonder. Oppenheimer has all the typical [[Superman]] powers, including X-ray vision ("see-through vision"), super strength, invulnerability, flight, heat-vision ("very hot vision"), and super hearing. Consequently, he looks down on The Tick as a lower form of superhero with limited powers.

Like many superheroes, The Tick has a sidekick, a rather plump former [[accountant]] named Arthur. Arthur wears a white [[moth]] suit that allows him to fly; however he is often mistaken for a bunny due to the long ear-like antennae of his costume and the fact that his wings are often folded up. The Tick is impulsive and Arthur serves as a sort of conscience. He also figures out the schemes of villains and formulates plans to stop them. Arthur's "battle cry" is "Not in the face! Not in the face!"

In the Amazon Prime video series, The Tick is fixated on Arthur, and even mentions at one point that his thinking is fuzzy when away from Arthur. Despite Arthur's repeated attempts to push The Tick away, the hero won't leave Arthur's side for long. The Tick also frequently talks about Destiny as if she is a literal person, guiding Arthur's path ("Destiny gave him the suit. I just acted in more of a 'delivery man' role"), alluding to the [[Parcae]] in Roman mythology.  At one point, Arthur starts to believe that The Tick is merely another hallucination, but that thought is quickly dispelled when Arthur's sister, Dot, interacts with "The Blue Guy." 

In all of his incarnations, The Tick is surrounded by a cast of equally absurd heroes and villains, many of them parodies of popular comic book characters and character types. Few of the "superheroes" in the Tick mythos have powers that would measure up to those of [[DC Comics]] or [[Marvel Comics]] characters, but their foes are often equally silly and/or weak. The Tick lives in a city simply called "The City". In the animated series, The Tick was assigned to The City after his "Cabinet of Terror" (described by The Tick as the "deadliest engine of destruction 1974 had to offer") exploded, leaving him unharmed, during his city assignment selection trials at the National Super Institute Convention in [[Reno, Nevada]]. According to the series' companion book, ''The Tick: Mighty Blue Justice!'', at least one of the judges was amazed by this, awarding The Tick a score of 10 out of 10.

==Powers and abilities==
The Tick possesses superhuman strength and mass, which makes him capable of inflicting great damage on his surroundings if he is not careful. His full strength is never actually quantified, although he is at the very least capable of lifting whole cars with a single hand, and comfortably bending steel girders. In the pilot of the 2016 series, The Tick claims to have the strength of "ten, perhaps twenty men - a crowded bus stop of men."

The Tick is also "nigh-invulnerable", which means it is almost impossible to injure him in any serious way (although he is vulnerable to feelings of pain and his antennae are particularly sensitive). Because of this he can survive moments of extreme stress, and has demonstrated this ability on numerous occasions. In one noteworthy instance, in the animated episode "Evil Sits Down for a Moment", he fell 4,000 feet out of the sky, crashing through the concrete road below into a subway tunnel, yet before he reached a stop he was subsequently hit by an oncoming train — and he survived it all without any lasting physical injury. Several powerful supervillains have been able to knock the Tick unconscious in several fights, but he never comes to any lasting harm. He also does not possess a super-powered immune system, as he has been seen sick with the common cold just like a normal person. One of the Tick's few limitations is that harming or removing his antennae will destroy his sense of balance.  

Finally, The Tick possesses something referred to as "[[drama]] power", or basically a tendency for The Tick's powers to increase as the situation becomes more dramatic. He can also survive in space without a suit, and under water without oxygen for "at least" a long time.

In the 2017 Amazon adaption, he is shown to be able to leap and bound great heights with ease and speed.

==Reception==
The Tick has been well received as a comic book character. [[Empire (magazine)|''Empire'' magazine]] ranked him as the 28th greatest comic book character of all time, stating that the Tick is a lovable lunk, given to overly dramatic declarations on behalf of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=28 | title=The Tick is number 28 | publisher=[[Empire (magazine)|''Empire'' magazine]] | accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] ranked him as the 57th greatest comic book hero of all time, saying that if you like your heroes on the bizarre side, you won't find anyone more surreal than The Tick. IGN also stated that whatever his mental state, The Tick's adventures are thoroughly enjoyable on both the printed page and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/57 | title=The Tick is number 57 | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wizard (magazine)|''Wizard'' magazine]] rated him as the 187th greatest comic book character of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://comicvine.gamespot.com/wizard/4010-2081/forums/wizards-top-200-comic-book-characters-644479/|title=Wizards top 200 comic book characters. - Wizard - Comic Vine|website=Comic Vine|language=en|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Merchandising===
{{also|List of Tick-related published material}}
While ''The Tick'' comic book series included some extras, such as [[trading cards]], the merchandising of The Tick increased dramatically with the launch of the animated series. [[Action figures]], stickers, [[pogs]], T-shirts, hats, party favors, costumes, and a [[board game]] were created. In addition, many fast food restaurant chains, such as [[Carl's Jr.]] and [[Taco Bell]] offered Tick-related giveaways.

In 1994, [[Fox Interactive]] also released a [[beat 'em up]] [[The Tick (video game)|video game]] based on the animated series. The game, however, was not well received.

Originally a [[Sega]] news and reviews fansite, UK Resistance expanded its coverage across all formats, and developed a style depending more on satirical updates rather than its original UK news and reviews content. The site officially closed on March 29, 2011&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web|url=http://www.ukresistance.co.uk/2011/03/closedown-march-29th-2011/|title=CLOSEDOWN, MARCH 29th 2011
|author=UK:Resistance|date=2011-03-29|accessdate=2011-03-29|publisher=Gary Cutlack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website is frequently referenced by games industry media, and its exposure led to a writer's position at ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' for Gary Cutlack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Rings of Saturn| journal=[[Retro Gamer]]| author=[[Damien McFerran]]| date=Christmas 2007| issue=45| pages=86–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The website has been described by ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' as the place where "Europe's Sega cognoscenti gathered to discuss the burning issues of the day",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Requiem for a Dream: The Life and Death of Dreamcast|journal=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|author=Edge staff|date=Christmas 2001|issue=105|pages=49–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' gaming blog as "the popular taking-on-the-industry slam page".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wired.com/games/2006/03/uk_resistance_u.html|title=UK Resistance, US Resistance, Sega Ads|author=[[Chris Kohler]]|date=2006-03-09|accessdate=2007-02-03|publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The site was often linked to from other gaming [[blogs]] such as [[Kotaku]] and [[Joystiq]].

Notable updates from the website include the '''Blue Sky in Games''' campaign, a campaign to reintroduce light hearted environments and settings into video games, as opposed to the prevalence of "realistic" [[gang violence]] games such as ''[[Saints Row]]''.  As UK Resistance themselves put it, "We want to play in a HAPPY PRETEND LAND, not a shit version of an American slum full of mixed-race gangsters wearing licensed sportswear!".  The campaign was picked up by websites such as [[Eurogamer]], who gave it their full backing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bring blue skies back to games!|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=61700|author=Ellie Gibson|date=2005-11-15|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[PC Zone]]'', who called the campaign "a just cause... that we heartily endorse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Crime Life: Gang Wars review|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=132231|author=PC Zone staff|date=2006-01-11|publisher=[[PC Zone]]|accessdate=2007-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UK Resistance was acquired by [[Shiny Media]] in June 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shiny welcomes Gary Cutlack of UK Resistance fame| url=http://www.shinymedia.com/2007/06/shiny-welcomes-.html| author=Ashley Norris, Gary Cutlack| publisher=Shiny Media| date=2007-06-29| accessdate=2007-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being returned to the sole ownership of Cutlack in June 2008 in lieu of money owed to him by Shiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shiny media has gone bust| url=http://www.ukresistance.co.uk/2009/07/shiny-media-has-gone-bust/| author=UK:Resistance| publisher=Gary Cutlack| date=2009-07-22| accessdate=2009-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, UK Resistance was voted Best Non-Commercial Website or Blog at the inaugural Games Media Awards held at the [[Soho#Raymond Revuebar|Soho Revue Bar]] in [[London]].

The '''Wiere Brothers''' were a comedy team who appeared in 1930s and 1940s films, and as live performers from the 1920s to the late 1960s.  

==History==
The names of the three brothers were:
* '''Harry Wiere''', (23 June 1906 in [[Berlin]], [[German Empire]] &amp;ndash; 15 January 1992)
* '''Herbert Wiere''', (27 February 1908 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]] &amp;ndash; 5 August 1999)
* '''Sylvester Wiere''', (17 September 1909 in [[Prague]], [[Austria-Hungary]] &amp;ndash; 7 July 1970)

[[File:Wiere brothers 1962.JPG|thumb|200px|From left: Sylvester, Herbert, and Harry from their 1962 television show, ''Oh, Those Bells!''.]]
The Wiere Brothers were vaudeville performers who occasionally appeared in films and television. Their films include ''Hands Across the Border'' in 1944 with [[Roy Rogers]], ''[[Road to Rio]]'' in 1947 with [[Bob Hope]] and [[Bing Crosby]], and [[Double Trouble (1967 film)|''Double Trouble'']] in 1967 as three detectives on the hunt for [[Elvis Presley]]. In 1962, the Wiere Brothers had their own [[television series]] called, ''[[Oh! Those Bells]]'', that aired on [[CBS]]. The show was created by [[Jules White]] who had previously directed [[the Three Stooges]], [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Andy Clyde]] in short-subject films for [[Columbia Pictures]]. ''Oh! Those Bells'' included a lot of [[slapstick]] comedy but only 13 episodes were aired. The team was still appearing on television in 1970 on shows such as ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'' and ''[[Laugh-In]]'' and were still touring the same year. But after Sylvester's death in July 1970, Harry and Herbert Wiere discontinued their act.&lt;ref name="lastyear"&gt;{{cite book

One of their popular acts of the 1960s involved the three brothers playing the [[violin]], [[guitar]] and [[bass fiddle]], and Mildred Seymour, their accompanist, performing a classical piece on the grand piano. Herbert would try to do a serious number on the violin but would get frustrated with his brothers' [[hillbilly]] antics. With a shrug, Herbert would stop playing and decide to balance the violin on his chin. Harry would then notice Herbert's accomplishment and would take the guitar and balance it on his chin. This left Sylvester smiling blandly at the audience, still plucking his bass fiddle. When Sylvester sees Herbert and Harry balancing their instruments on their chins, he would do a long take, turning from his brothers to his huge bass fiddle and then back at them. Then, finally Sylvester would lift the bass fiddle in the air and balance it on his chin for the finale.&lt;ref name="chinbalancing"&gt;{{cite book

They performed four command performances for the queen of England.

[[Inga Wiere]], a sister of Herbert, Harry and Sylvester Wiere, was married to dancer [[Jon Zerby]]. Together they were known as The Dancing Zerbys, a successful nightclub act in the 1940s and 1950s. Actress and dancer [[Kim Darby]] is their daughter.
