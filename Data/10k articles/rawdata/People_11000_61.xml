'''Adelaide Anne Procter''' (30 October 1825&amp;nbsp;– 2 February 1864) was an English poet and [[philanthropist]]. She worked prominently on behalf of unemployed women and the homeless, and was actively involved with [[feminist]] groups and journals. Procter never married. She became unhealthy, possibly due to her charity work, and died of [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 38.

Procter's literary career began when she was a teenager; her poems were primarily published in [[Charles Dickens]]'s periodicals ''[[Household Words]]'' and ''[[All the Year Round]]'' and later  published in book form. Her charity work and her conversion to [[Roman Catholicism]] appear to have strongly influenced her poetry, which deals most commonly with such subjects as homelessness, poverty, and [[fallen woman|fallen women]].

Procter was the favourite poet of [[Queen Victoria]]. Her poetry went through numerous editions in the 19th century; [[Coventry Patmore]] called her the most popular poet of the day, after [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]].&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; Her poems were set to music and made into hymns, and were published in the United States and Germany as well as in England. Nonetheless, by the early 20th century her reputation had diminished, and few modern critics have given her work attention. Those who have, however, argue that Procter's work is significant, in part for what it reveals about how [[Women in the Victorian era|Victorian women]] expressed otherwise repressed feelings.

==Life==
Adelaide Anne Procter was born at 25 [[Bedford Square]] in the [[Bloomsbury]] district of London, on 30 October 1825 to the poet [[Bryan Procter|Bryan Waller Procter]] and his wife Anne (''née'' Skepper).&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;Gregory (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; The family had strong literary ties: novelist [[Elizabeth Gaskell]] enjoyed her visits to the Procter household,&lt;ref name="Gregory 1998, 5"&gt;Gregory (1998), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and Procter's father was friends with poet [[Leigh Hunt]], essayist [[Charles Lamb]], and novelist [[Charles Dickens]],&lt;ref name="O'Gorman"&gt;O'Gorman (2004), 314.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being acquainted with poet [[William Wordsworth]]&lt;ref&gt;Blair (2004), 128.&lt;/ref&gt; and critic [[William Hazlitt]].&lt;ref name=H&amp;W1&gt;Hickok and Woodall (1998), 519.&lt;/ref&gt; Family friend [[Bessie Rayner Parkes|Bessie Rayner Belloc]] wrote in 1895 that "everybody of any literary pretension whatever seemed to flow in and out of the house. The Kembles, the Macreadys, the Rossettis, the Dickens {{sic}}, the Thackerays, never seemed to be exactly visitors, but to belong to the place."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory (1999), 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Author and actress [[Fanny Kemble]] wrote that young Procter "looks like a poet's child, and a poet ... [with] a preter-naturally {{sic}} thoughtful, mournful expression for such a little child".&lt;ref name="Gregory 1998, 5" /&gt;

Dickens spoke highly of Procter's quick intelligence. By his account, the young Procter mastered without difficulty the subjects to which she turned her attention:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When she was quite a young child, she learnt with facility several of the problems of [[Euclid]]. As she grew older, she acquired the French, Italian, and German languages ... piano-forte ... [and] drawing. But, as soon as she had completely vanquished the difficulties of any one branch of study, it was her way to lose interest in it, and pass to another.&lt;ref name="Dickens 1866, 3"&gt;Dickens (1866), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
A voracious reader,&lt;ref name="Dickens 1866, 3" /&gt; Procter was largely self-taught, though she studied at [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] in Harley Street in 1850.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; The college had been founded in 1848 by [[Frederick Denison Maurice|Frederick Maurice]], a [[Christian Socialist]]; the faculty included novelist [[Charles Kingsley]], composer [[John Hullah]], and writer [[Henry Morley]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Victoria regia, poetry and prose (1861).djvu|left|thumb|upright|alt= Book cover showing a large, deep blue volume. The words "Victoria Regia" are prominent in the center, in a large, heavy, old-fashioned font, with gold embossed lettering. The title is surrounded by gold-embossed scrolls.|The 1861 edition of the ''Victoria Regia'', edited by Procter]]
Procter showed a love of poetry from an early age, carrying with her while still a young child a "tiny album ... into which her favourite passages were copied for her by her mother's hand before she herself could write ... as another little girl might have carried a doll".&lt;ref name="Dickens 1866, 3" /&gt; Procter published her first poem while still a teenager; the poem, "Ministering Angels", appeared in ''Heath's Book of Beauty'' in 1843.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; In 1853 she submitted work to Dickens's ''[[Household Words]]'' under the name "Mary Berwick", wishing that her work be judged on its own merits rather than in relation to Dickens's friendship with her father;&lt;ref&gt;Dickens (1866), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Dickens did not learn "Berwick's" identity till the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Dickens (1866), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The poem's publication began Procter's long association with Dickens's periodicals; in all, Procter published 73 poems in ''Household Words'' and 7 poems in ''[[All the Year Round]]'',&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; most of which were collected into her first two volumes of poetry, both entitled ''Legends and Lyrics''. She was also published in ''Good Words'' and ''Cornhill.''&lt;ref name="Dickens 1866, 3" /&gt; As well as writing poetry, Procter was the editor of the journal ''Victoria Regia'', which became the showpiece of the [[Victoria Press]], "an explicitly feminist publishing venture".&lt;ref&gt;Chapman (2003), 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851,&lt;ref&gt;Bessie Rayner Parkes Belloc gives the date as 1849; Dickens as 1851 in his "Introduction" to the 1866 edition of ''Legends and Lyrics''. The introduction was read and approved by Procter's mother; Gill Gregory therefore argues that Dickens's date is the correct one (Gregory [1998], 8).&lt;/ref&gt; Procter converted to [[Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref name="O'Gorman" /&gt; Following her conversion, Procter became extremely active in several charitable and feminist causes. She became a member of the [[History of feminism#The ladies of Langham Place|Langham Place Group]], which set out to improve conditions for women, and was friends with [[feminist]]s [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]] (later Bessie Rayner Belloc) and [[Barbara Bodichon|Barbara Leigh Smith]], later Barbara Bodichon.&lt;ref name="O'Gorman" /&gt; Procter helped found the ''[[English Woman's Journal]]'' in 1858 and, in 1859, the Society for the Promotion of the Employment of Women,&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; both of which focused on expanding women's economic and employment opportunities. Though on paper Procter was merely one member among many, fellow-member [[Jessie Boucherett]] considered her to be the "animating spirit" of the Society.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory (1998), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Her third volume of poetry, ''A Chaplet of Verses'' (1861), was published for the benefit of a Catholic Night Refuge for Women and Children that had been founded  in 1860 at Providence Row in [[East End of London|East London]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Procter became engaged in 1858, according to a letter that her friend [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] wrote to his daughters that year. The identity of Procter's fiancé remains unknown, and the proposed marriage never took place.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 21.&lt;/ref&gt; According to her German biographer Ferdinand Janku, the engagement seems to have lasted several years before being broken off by Procter's fiancé.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory (1998), 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Gill Gregory suggests that Procter may have been a [[lesbian]] and in love with [[Matilda Hays]], a fellow member of the Society for the Promotion of the Employment of Women;&lt;ref name="Gregory25"&gt;Gregory (1998), 25.&lt;/ref&gt; other critics have called Procter's relationship with Hays "emotionally intense."&lt;ref name=H123&gt;Hoeckley (2007), 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Procter's first volume of poetry, ''Legends and Lyrics'' (1858) was dedicated to Hays and that same year Procter wrote a poem titled "To M.M.H."&lt;ref&gt;Later published in ''Legends and Lyrics'' as "A Retrospect".&lt;/ref&gt; in which Procter "expresses love for Hays ... [Hays was a] novelist and translator of [[George Sand]] and a controversial figure ... [who] dressed in men's clothes and had lived with the sculptor [[Harriet Hosmer]] in Rome earlier in the 1850s."&lt;ref name="Gregory25" /&gt; While several men showed interest in her, Procter never married.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Procter fell ill in 1862; Dickens and others have suggested that her illness was due to her extensive charity work, which "appears to have unduly taxed her strength".&lt;ref&gt;Dickens (1866), 9; Lennox (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; An attempt to improve her health by taking a [[Water cure (therapy)|cure]] at [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]] failed.&lt;ref name="Lennox" /&gt; On 3 February 1864, Procter died of [[tuberculosis]], having been bed-ridden for almost a year.&lt;ref name="Gregory 1998, 1"&gt;Gregory (1998), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Her death was described in the press as a "national calamity".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gray (1999), 682.&lt;/ref&gt; Procter was buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="Lennox" /&gt;

==Literary career==
Procter's poetry was strongly influenced by her religious beliefs and charity work; homelessness, poverty, and [[fallen women]] are frequent themes. Procter's prefaces to her volumes of poetry stress the misery of the conditions under which the poor lived, as do poems such as "The Homeless Poor":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In that very street, at that same hour,&lt;br /&gt;
In the bitter air and drifting sleet,&lt;br /&gt;
Crouching in a doorway was a mother,&lt;br /&gt;
With her children shuddering at her feet.

She was silent&amp;nbsp;– who would hear her pleading?&lt;br /&gt;
Men and beasts were housed&amp;nbsp;– but she must stay&lt;br /&gt;
Houseless in the great and pitiless city,&lt;br /&gt;
Till the dawning of the winter day. (51–58)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory (1998), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Procter's Catholicism also influenced her choice of images and symbols;&lt;ref name=H127&gt;Hoeckley (2007), 127.&lt;/ref&gt; Procter often uses references to the Virgin Mary, for example, to "introduce secular and Protestant readers to the possibility that a heavenly order critiques Victorian gender ideology's power structure."&lt;ref name=H127 /&gt;

Procter wrote several poems about war (the majority of poems published on this topic in ''Household Words'' were by Procter&lt;ref&gt;Markovits (2005), 472.&lt;/ref&gt;), although she rarely deals directly with the topic, preferring to leave war "in the background, something to be inferred rather than stated."&lt;ref name=M473&gt;Markovits (2005), 473.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, these poems portray conflict as something "that might unite a nation that had been divided by class distinctions."&lt;ref name=M473 /&gt;

According to critic Gill Gregory, Procter "does not overtly ponder the vexed question of the poet, particularly the woman poet and her accession to fame",&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 56.&lt;/ref&gt; unlike many other women poets of the time, such as [[Felicia Hemans]] and [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]. Procter is instead primarily concerned with the working classes, particularly working-class women, and with "emotions of women antagonists which have not fully found expression".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Procter's work often embodies a Victorian aesthetic of sentimentality,&lt;ref&gt;Mason (2006), 82, 86.&lt;/ref&gt; but, according to Francis O'Gorman, does so with "peculiar strength"; Procter employs emotional affect without simplification, holding "emotional energy [in tension] ... against complications and nuances."&lt;ref name="O'Gorman" /&gt; Procter's language is simple; she expressed to a friend a "morbid terror of being misunderstood and misinterpreted",&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gregory (1998), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; and her poetry is marked by "simplicity, directness, and clarity of expression".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1998), 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Procter was "fabulously popular"&lt;ref name="Gray682"&gt;Gray (1999), 682.&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-19th century; she was [[Queen Victoria]]'s favourite poet&lt;ref name="Gregory 1998, 1" /&gt; and [[Coventry Patmore]] stated that the demand for her work was greater than that for any other poet, excepting [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]].&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; Readers valued Procter's poems for their plainness of expression,&lt;ref&gt;Belloc (1895), 173.&lt;/ref&gt; although they were considered "not so very original in thought; [their merit is that] they are indeed the utterances 'of a believing heart', pouring out its fulness."&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1868), 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Procter herself expressed little ambition about her work: her friend Bessie Raynor Belloc thought that Procter was pained that her reputation as a poet had outstripped her father's, and quoted Procter as saying that "Papa is a poet. I only write verses."&lt;ref&gt;Belloc (1895), 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Procter's popularity continued after her death; the first volume of ''Legends and Lyrics'' went through 19 editions by 1881, and the second through 14 editions by the same year.&lt;ref name="Gray682" /&gt; Many of her poems were made into hymns&lt;ref name="Lennox"&gt;Lennox (1911).&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise set to music.  Among these was "[[The Lost Chord]]", which [[Arthur Sullivan]] set to music in 1877; this song was the most commercially successful of the 1870s and 1880s in both Britain and the United States.&lt;ref name=Scott&gt;Scott (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Her work was also published in the United States and translated into German.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt; By 1938, Procter's reputation had fallen so far that a textbook could mention her poems only to pronounce them "stupid, trivial and not worthy of the subject".&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Poetry'', 1938, quoted in Psomiades (2000), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics such as Cheri Larsen Hoeckley, Kathleen Hickok, and Natalie Joy Woodall argue that the demise of Procter's reputation is due at least in part to the way Charles Dickens characterized her as a "model middle-class domestic angel"&lt;ref name=H125&gt;Hoeckley (2007), 125.&lt;/ref&gt; and a "fragile and modest saint"&lt;ref name=H&amp;W520&gt;Hickok and Woodall (1998), 520.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than as an "active feminist and strong poet."&lt;ref name=H&amp;W520 /&gt; Emma Mason argues that although Dickens's portrayal of Procter "extinguished modern interest" in her, it also "has helped rescue Procter from the kind of endless conjecture about her private life that has confused studies of women like [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon|Letitia Landon]]."&lt;ref name=Mason81&gt;Mason (2006), 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern critics have given Procter's work little attention. The few critics who have examined Procter's poetry generally find it important for the way that she overtly expresses conventional sentiments while covertly undermining them. According to [[Isobel Armstrong]], Procter's poetry, like that of many 19th-century women poets, employs conventional ideas and modes of expression without necessarily espousing them in entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong (1996), 251, 265.&lt;/ref&gt; Francis O'Gorman cites "A Legend of Provence" as an example of a poem with this kind of "double relationship with the structures of gender politics it seems to affirm."&lt;ref&gt;O'Gorman (2004), 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics since Armstrong agree that Procter's poetry, while ladylike on the surface, shows signs of repressed emotions and desires.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeckley (2007), 130; Mason (2006), 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Kirstie Blair states that the suppression of emotion in Procter's work makes the narrative poems all the more powerful,&lt;ref&gt;Blair (2004), 135.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gill Gregory argues that Procter's poetry often explores female sexuality in an unconventional way, while as often voicing anxiety about sexual desires.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory (1996), 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Gray criticizes the fact that the few discussions of Procter's poetry that do exist focus primarily on gender, arguing that the "range and formal inventiveness of this illuminatingly representative Victorian poet have remained largely unexplored."&lt;ref name="Gray682" /&gt;

'''Aliaskhab Alibulatovich Kebekov''' ({{lang-ru|Алиасхаб Алибулатович Кебеков; 1 January 1972&amp;nbsp;– 19 April 2015}}),&lt;ref name=knot180314&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/239677/|title=Али Абу Мухаммад (Кебеков Алиасхаб Алибулатович)|publisher=Caucasus Knot|date=18 March 2014|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Ali Abu Muhammad''' ({{lang-ru|Али Абу Мухаммад}}),&lt;ref name=lwj180314 /&gt; was a [[Dagestan]]i militant [[Islamist]] in Russia and the leader of the [[Caucasus Emirate]] following the death of inaugural leader [[Dokka Umarov]]. Following in the same religious tradition as Umarov, he adhered to the ideology of [[Salafism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ict.org.il/Article/132/Salafist-Takfiri%20Jihadism%20the%20Ideology%20of%20the%20Caucasus%20Emirate Salafist-Takfiri Jihadism: The Ideology of the  Caucasus Emirate&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of State]] added Kebekov to its list of [[Specially Designated Global Terrorist|Specially Designated Global Terrorists]] on March 25, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/03/239759.htm|title=Terrorist Designation of Aliaskhab Kebekov|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April 2015, Kebekov was killed by Russian security forces during special operations in the settlement of Gerei-Avlak in [[Buynaksk]].&lt;ref name=lwj190415&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2015/04/russian-troops-kill-leader-of-islamic-caucasus-emirate.php|title=Russian troops kill leader of Islamic Caucasus Emirate|publisher=Long War Journal|date=19 April 2014|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avar]] by nationality, Kebekov was the first non-Chechen to lead the North Caucasus insurgency.

==Early life and career==
Aliaskhab Kebekov was born on 1 January 1972 in what is now the [[Shamilsky District]] of Dagestan.&lt;ref name=knot180314 /&gt; He joined the [[Vilayat Dagestan]] wing of the Caucasus Emirate. In October 2010, Kebekov was appointed by [[Dokka Umarov]] as the [[Qadi]] or judge of the Caucasus Emirate, responsible for giving [[Shariah]] rulings on the groups actions. Kebekov accepted the role, despite expressing doubts about his suitability, as he was not a [[Mujtahid]] or a scholar with extensive knowledge of the [[Koran]] and [[Sunnah]].&lt;ref name=lwj180314&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/threat-matrix/archives/2014/03/ali_abu_muhammad_al_dagestani.php|title=Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov 'dead'|publisher=Long War Journal|date=18 March 2014|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caucasus Emirate leadership==
On 16 January 2014, an audio clip was posted on [[YouTube]], in which a voice claiming to be Kebekov acknowledged receiving the news that Umarov had died. Kebekov seemingly rejected the proposal by other emirs of the group that he should succeed Umarov, stating that he had no military experience and had never served as a commander; instead he proposed [[Aslambek Vadalov]] for the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/doku-umarov-dead-questions/25236011.html|title=Is Doku Umarov Really Dead? Assessing The Circumstantial Evidence|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=20 January 2014|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in March he acceded to demands and accepted the appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Chechen militant leader Doku Umarov is dead: Reports |date=19 March 2014 |newspaper=The Times of India |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/Chechen-militant-leader-Doku-Umarov-is-dead-Reports/articleshow/32270150.cms |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140319145518/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/Chechen-militant-leader-Doku-Umarov-is-dead-Reports/articleshow/32270150.cms |archivedate=19 March 2014 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caucasus Emirate linked [[Kavkaz Center]] announced Kebekov's appointment, together with acknowledgment of Umarov's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26634403|title=Ali Abu Muhammad al Dagestani, the new emir of the Islamic Caucasus Emirate|publisher=BBC|date=18 March 2014|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the weeks after this announcement, the site also posted [[Bay'ah|pledges of allegiance]] to Kebekov from groups in Dagestan, Chechnya, Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, as well as members of the Chechen-led Syria-based [[Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar]].&lt;ref name=ni22april&gt;{{Cite web|title=North Caucasus Fighters in Syria Pledge Allegiance to Umarov's Successor|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/caucasus-syria-fighters-allegiance-/25315330.html|date=31 March 2014|accessdate=29 April 2014|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a video recording posted on the Internet in June 2014, Kebekov apologised to civilians that had been harmed by Caucasus Emirate attacks and stated that civilians should not be targeted by the group. He also called on militants not to use [[Shahidka|black widows]] in armed attacks or suicide bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eng.kavkaz-uzel.ru/articles/28582/|title="Imarat Kavkaz" leader calls on militants to abandon suicide bombings and terror acts against civilians|publisher=Caucasian Knot|date=1 July 2014|accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caucasus Emirate has become more active in their insurgent activities. On 5 October 2014 a suicide bombing near the [[Grozny]] city hall took place. Five Russian police officers were killed, the suicide bomber was also killed, 12 other people were wounded. The Caucasus Emirate took credit for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29498909|publisher=BBC|title=Five killed in suicide bombing in Chechen capital}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byutukayev took responsibility for the [[2014 Grozny clashes]] during which 14 Russian policemen were killed and 35 total people were wounded. The attack was one of the largest since the [[December 2013 Volgograd bombings]], which were also carried out by the [[Caucasus Emirate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/in-kremlin-economy-speech-putin-rails-at-west-tries-to-avert-russia-recession/2014/12/04/f940afe8-79b4-11e4-8241-8cc0a3670239_story.html?tid=pm_world_pop|publisher=Washington Post|title=In Kremlin speech, Putin rails at West, tries to bolster economy as recession looms}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after the Grozny attack a Russian [[Federal Security Service]] building in neighboring [[Dagestan]] was reported to be engulfed in flames. If the attack was carried out by the [[Caucasus Emirate]] this would represent three large scale attacks in three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/video/russia-intelligence-building-fire-dagestan-174957447.html|publisher=Yahoo|title=Russia Intelligence Service Building on Fire in Dagestan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2014 and early 2015, at least 6 field commanders of the Caucasus Emirate, and an unknown number of ordinary members, switched their allegiance from Kebekov to the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] leader [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]].&lt;ref name="rferl02Jan15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rferl.mobi/a/islamic-state-north-caucasus-insurgency-commanders-allegiance/26773615.html|title=Six North Caucasus Insurgency Commanders Transfer Allegiance To Islamic State|author=Liz Fuller |date=2015-01-02 |work= |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|accessdate=2015-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 April 2015, Kebekov was killed by Russian security forces during a raid on a house in the settlement of Gerei-Avlak in [[Buynaksk]].&lt;ref name=lwj190415/&gt;&lt;ref name="KebekovDead"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/20/us-russia-dagestan-idUSKBN0NB0VI20150420|title=Russia says kills head of North Caucasus Islamist insurgency|publisher=Reuters|date=20 April 2015|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was reportedly succeeded as Caucasus Emirate leader by [[Magomed Suleimanov]].&lt;ref name=successor/&gt;

==The Huffington Post==
Reddi is a featured blogger on [[The Huffington Post]] writing on global health and U.S. domestic healthcare issues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anand-reddi/&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010 Reddi published an opinion-editorial article&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anand-reddi/united-states-global-heal_b_654002.html op-ed]&lt;/ref&gt; that brought attention to the flat-lining of global AIDS funds by U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]'s administration.&lt;ref&gt;Anand Reddi, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anand-reddi/united-states-global-heal_b_654002.htmla United States Global Health Policy: HIV/AIDS Treatment Funding At Risk Under President Obama].  ''The Huffington Post'', July 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Within six hours, [[Ezekiel Emanuel]], then senior adviser to President Obama for Health Policy, responded directly to Reddi by [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zeke-emanuel/aids-activism_b_654710.html writing] in the Huffington Post: "Contrary to what Dr. Reddi argues, neither I nor the Obama Administration sees an "either-or" trade-off between PEPFAR and other global health priorities such as improving maternal-child health." &lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel Emanuel, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zeke-emanuel/aids-activism_b_654710.html The HIV/AIDS Fight Needs Cooperation, Not Division], ''The Huffington Post'', July 21, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Reddi rebutted Emanuel's op-ed&lt;ref&gt;Anand Reddi, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anand-reddi/truth-and-reconciliation_b_660586.html Truth and Reconciliation: President Obama's Global Health Initiative and HIV/AIDS -- Raising the Bar], ''The Huffington Post'', July 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; with a follow-up post that resulted in the restoration of $366 million for antiretroviral scale-up in Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;Anand Reddi, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anand-reddi/truth-and-reconciliation_b_660586.html Truth and Reconciliation: President Obama's Global Health Initiative and HIV/AIDS -- Raising the Bar], ''The Huffington Post'', July 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.devex.com/en/news/eric-goosby-bill-clinton-defend-obama-s-aids/68608?lang=ja&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.devex.com/en/news/obama-promises-to-step-up-aids-fight/68627?source=ArticleHomepage_Headline&lt;/ref&gt;

== AIDS Healthcare Foundation ==
In 2011, Reddi resigned from the Board of Directors of the [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]] over a disagreement with AHF's opposition to [[Pre-exposure prophylaxis|Pre-exposure Prophylaxis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110309006414/en/AHF-Gilead-%25E2%2580%259CNo-Magic-Pill%25E2%2580%259D-Ads-Warn|title=AHF to Gilead: "No Magic Pill" Ads Warn against AIDS Drug as HIV Prevention {{!}} Business Wire|website=www.businesswire.com|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reddi criticized AHF's claims against PrEP in an op-ed in ''The Huffington Post'' writing: "AHF’s media campaign against FDA review of PrEP is myopic, blinded by its determination to derail a promising new medication."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anand-reddi/hiv-prevention-drugs-fda-review_b_1070511.html|title=Moving Forward on FDA Review of HIV Prevention Drugs|last=Reddi|first=Anand|date=2011-11-02|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human Capital Contracts==
Reddi and Andreas Thyssen, while students at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, were the first to propose the use of [[human capital contracts]] to fund medical education in the United States in their article in ''The Huffington Post'' entitled: "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anand-reddi/healthcare-reform-solving_b_874651.html Healthcare Reform: Solving the Medical Student Debt Crisis Through Human Capital Contracts]".  The Reddi-Thyssen plan resulted in legislation by the [[American Medical Association]] in support of human capital contracts.  There is also a plan to use [[human capital contracts]] in [[global health]].  Thyssen and Reddi published a manuscript in ''AIDS'' advocating the use of [[human capital contracts]] to increase the number of healthcare workers educated in resource limited settings.  Human capital contracts for global health mechanism is that an investor, such as a donor nation, charitable foundation, or global health initiative, will cover the entire cost of a student's medical training.  In exchange, the student will work for the first 10 years of their medical career in a government or NGO sponsored health clinic in their respective country of medical education.  Their medical license will be contingent on this obligatory national service.  Additionally, a multilateral “binding” agreement between the African country and destination countries (such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and the United States)-brokered by the investor- could prevent migration during the term period.&lt;ref&gt;*Reddi A, Thyssen A, Smith D, Lange JH, Akileswaran C.

'''Andrew Harvey''' (born 1952) is a British author, religious scholar and teacher of [[mysticism|mystic]] traditions, known primarily for his popular nonfiction books on spiritual or mystical themes, beginning with his 1983 ''A Journey in [[Ladakh]]''. He is the author of over 30 books, including, ''The Hope, A Guide to Sacred Activism'', ''The Direct Path'', the critically acclaimed ''Way of Passion: A Celebration of [[Rumi]]'', ''The Return of the Mother'' and ''[[Son of Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hayhouse.com/authorbio.php?id=451 Author Biography] [[Hay House]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Soul Searching|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/11/books/soul-searching.html?pagewanted=all |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=11 August 1991 | first=Jane | last=O'Reilly | accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the subject of the 1993 [[BBC]] documentary "The Making of a Modern Mystic" and is the founder of the [[Sacred Activism]] movement.

Harvey lives in a rural area of the Ozark Mountains in Arkansas, where he continues to write when he is not lecturing. Harvey conducts workshops on Sacred Activism, the teachings of Rumi, [[yoga]] and practices that will lead to deeper spiritual awareness. Harvey travels with students to sacred sites in [[India]], Australia and South Africa, and offers personal spiritual direction.  [[Watkins Books#Watkins' Spiritual 100 list for 2012|Harvey was listed as number 33]] in the Watkins' Mind Body Spirit magazine as one of the 100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.watkinsbooks.com/review/watkins-spiritual-100-list-2012 |title=Archived copy |access-date=6 March 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HMtYeqnv?url=http://www.watkinsbooks.com/review/watkins-spiritual-100-list-2012 |archive-date=14 June 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, he was nominated for the [[Templeton Prize]], which was eventually awarded to the Dalai Lama.

==Early life and education==
Harvey was born in [[Coimbatore]], [[India]] in 1952 and lived there until he was nine years old. He was educated at English [[boarding school]]s and then [[Oxford University]], where he later taught [[Shakespeare]] and French literature until 1977. He wrote his [[dissertation]] on [[Insanity|madness]] in Shakespeare and [[Erasmus]].

==Career==
At 21 in the early 1970s, Harvey became a [[Oxbridge Fellow|fellow]] of [[All Souls College]], [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/catalog/author.htm?authorID=990 Andrew Harvey] Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1977 he had become disillusioned with life at Oxford and returned to his native India, where a series of mystical experiences initiated his spiritual journey. Over the next thirty years he plunged into different mystical traditions to learn their secrets and practices. In 1978 he met a succession of Indian saints and sages and began his study and practice of [[Hinduism]]. In 1983, in Ladakh, he met a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] [[adept]], [[Thuksey Rinpoche]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Thuksey_Rinpoche&lt;/ref&gt; and undertook with him the [[Mahayana Buddhist]] [[bodhisattva]] vows; later, in 1990, he would collaborate with [[Sogyal Rinpoche]] and [[Patrick Gaffney (Buddhist)|Patrick Gaffney]] in the writing of ''[[The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying]]''. In 1984, Harvey began a ten-year-long exploration and explication of Rumi and [[Sufi]] mysticism in Paris with a group of French Sufis under the guidance of [[Eva de Vitray-Meyerovitch]], the translator of Rumi into French. In 1992, he met Father [[Bede Griffiths]] in his [[ashram]] in south India near where Harvey had been born. It was this meeting that helped him synthesize the whole of his mystical explorations and reconcile Eastern with [[Western mysticism]]. 
 
While in India, Harvey encountered [[Mother Meera]], who became his [[guru]] and the subject of his book ''Hidden Journey''. His memoir, ''The Sun at Midnight'', describes their subsequent break and his disillusionment with gurus.

For the last 30 years, Harvey has travelled widely, living in India, London, Paris, New York and San Francisco, studying, teaching at university level and in seminars and workshops. A prolific writer, Harvey has authored or co-authored over 30 books. His focus since 2005 has been the advocacy of what he terms "Sacred Activism". He is the founder and director of the Institute of Sacred Activism, which trains leaders and [[social justice]] advocates.

==Teachings==
Harvey is a scholar of mystic traditions. He envisions true [[spirituality]] to be the [[:wikt:deify|divinisation]] of earthly life through [[spiritual practice]]. These practices can take many forms and can be taken from religious traditions.
Harvey sees six poets and religious figures as having universal appeal:
:*[[Siddhartha Gautama|Buddha]] as portrayed in the ''[[Dhammapada]]''
:*[[Jesus]] as portrayed in the ''[[Gospel of Thomas]]''
:*[[Rumi]], a 13th century [[Sufi]] poet. 
:*[[Kabir]], a 15th century Indian poet
:*[[Ramakrishna]], a 19th century [[Hindu]] [[sadhu]]
:*[[Aurobindo]], a 20th century Hindu philosopher-[[Wise old man|sage]]

Harvey also emphasises the Divine Feminine, as expressed in the [[Virgin Mary]], [[Kali]], the [[Black Madonna]] and [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]].

Since 2005, Andrew Harvey's work has focused on teaching Sacred Activism around the globe.  Harvey describes sacred activism as "the product of the union of a profound spiritual and mystical knowledge, understanding, and compassion, peace and energy, with focused, wise, radical action in the world."

As a teen, Everhart became a cover model for such fashion magazines as ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'' and ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]''. Following a horseback riding accident in which she broke her back at the age of 19, Everhart eventually recovered through [[physical therapy]]. She appeared in several issues of the annual ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' swimsuit edition, starting in 1995. Everhart posed nude for a cover-featured pictorial in the February 2000 issue of ''[[Playboy]]''. She was ranked #98 on the [[FHM]] 100 Sexiest Women of 2003.&lt;ref name="freejose2003"&gt;{{cite web | title=FreeJose.com | work=FHM 100 Sexiest Women of 2003 | url=http://www.freejose.com/lists/fhm/2003/ | accessdate=January 28, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070228112048/http://www.freejose.com/lists/fhm/2003/| archivedate= February 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has also appeared on a few game and reality shows.

She was one of the "Gingers" on the second season of ''[[The Real Gilligan's Island]]'' (the other was [[Erika Eleniak]]), but left the show when she accidentally cut her finger severely enough to sever [[tendon]]s and require surgery. Everhart was also a panelist on ''[[To Tell The Truth]]'' from 2000 until 2001 and on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' from 2002 until 2004. Everhart was a co-host on the ABC reality show ''[[The Ex-Wives Club]]'', along with [[Marla Maples]], and [[Shar Jackson]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angie Everhart|url=http://www.gossiprocks.com/angie-everhart|publisher=gossiprocks.com|accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Everhart was married to [[Ashley Hamilton]] from December 1, 1996, until their divorce in March 1997.  [[Sylvester Stallone]] and Everhart were briefly engaged in 1995, but they never made it down the aisle. &lt;!--briefly dated [[Howard Stern]] in late 2000 and--&gt;She was &lt;!--briefly--&gt; engaged to &lt;!-- [[Sylvester Stallone]]and Angie Everhart were briefly engaged in 1995, but they never made it down the aisle.  in 1995 and--&gt; [[Joe Pesci]],&lt;!--in 2007.--&gt;&lt;ref name=sfgate&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=7&amp;entry_id=19023 | title=Pesci to Wed Everhart | accessdate=July 31, 2007 | date=July 30, 2007 | work =[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | first=Karen | last=Reardanz}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the couple broke up in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://breakingnews.iol.ie/entertainment/story.asp?j=253669330&amp;p=z5367xx36|title= Pesci ends engagement with model Everhart|accessdate= April 25, 2008|date= April 25, 2008|publisher= Ireland On-line| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080430170839/http://breakingnews.iol.ie/entertainment/story.asp?j=253669330&amp;p=z5367xx36| archivedate= April 30, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a [[sky-diving]] enthusiast, Everhart gave up the activity following an accident in which she was injured badly enough to require back surgery.&lt;ref&gt;"Jermaine Jackson, Angie Everhart, Elisabeth Rohm, Jose Canseco."

Everhart was diagnosed with [[thyroid cancer]] and had surgery on May 14, 2013. A representative of hers said, "[Angie] wants to set the record straight by letting everyone know that it is true that she has been diagnosed with thyroid cancer, however, the prognosis is very good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANGIE EVERHART I Have Thyroid Cancer|url=http://www.tmz.com/2013/05/13/angie-everhart-diagnosed-thyroid-cancer/|publisher=TMZ|accessdate=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She filed for bankruptcy due to medical expenses from thyroid cancer treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angie Everhart Files for Bankruptcy After Thyroid Cancer Battle|url=http://www.extratv.com/2014/10/03/angie-everhart-files-for-bankruptcy-after-bout-with-cancer/|publisher=Extra|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antoni Martí Petit''' (born 30 July 1963) is an Andorran [[architect]] and [[politician]] who has been the [[Prime Minister of Andorra]] since May 2011, when he was elected on the ticket of the [[Democrats for Andorra]]. He was re-elected in the 2015 parliamentary election.

==Early life and education==

Martí was born in [[Escaldes-Engordany]] and studied at the [[:fr:École nationale supérieure d'architecture de Toulouse|École nationale supérieure d'architecture de Toulouse]] (Toulouse National School of Architecture), part of the [[Université fédérale de Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées]]. He is an architect by profession.&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=https://www.govern.ad/images/stories/govern/CVs/CV_A_Marti.pdf|website=Andorran government|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

Martí was first elected to the [[General Council (Andorra)|General Council]] in [[Andorran parliamentary election, 1993|1993]], the first parliamentary election to involve political parties, as a member of the [[Liberal Party of Andorra|Liberal Union]]. In the election, the Liberal Union came a close second. [[Òscar Ribas Reig]], who had been appointed [[Prime Minister of Andorra|Prime Minister]], lost a vote of no confidence in 1994, leading to [[Marc Forné Molné]], the leader of the Liberal Union, being appointed as Prime Minister. Martí was re-elected in the [[Andorran parliamentary election, 1997|1997 election]], in which the Liberal Union won and Molné remained as Prime Minister. Shortly before the [[Andorran parliamentary election, 2001|2001 election]], the Liberal Union was renamed as the Liberal Party of Andorra, and went on to win the election, with Molné retaining his role as Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="cap"&gt;{{cite web|title=El Cap de Govern|url=https://www.govern.ad/el-cap-de-govern|website=Govern d'Andorra|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Martí resigned from the General Council and was elected as Mayor of [[Escaldes-Engordany]], the second largest town in Andorra.&lt;ref name="prof"&gt;{{cite news|title=Andorra profile - Leaders|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17028056|accessdate=14 July 2016|work=BBC News|date=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served two consecutive terms as Mayor, from 2004 to 2007, and from 2008 to 2011. The Liberal Party had contested the [[Andorran parliamentary election, 2009|2009 election]] as part of the Reformist Coalition, losing to the [[Social Democratic Party (Andorra)|Social Democratic Party]] led by [[Jaume Bartumeu]]. Bartumeu opted to call an [[Andorran parliamentary election, 2011|early election in 2011]] after losing the budget vote two years running to the opposition parties. In February 2011, the [[Democrats for Andorra]] was formed as a direct successor to the Reformist Coalition, with Martí as their candidate for Prime Minister. He campaigned against Bartumeu's proposed introduction of an income tax. The Democrats for Andorra won 55.5% of the vote, and Bartumeu resigned as Prime Minister on 28 April 2011, to be replaced by [[Pere López Agràs]] in an interim capacity until 12 May 2011, when Martí was appointed.&lt;ref name=prof /&gt;&lt;ref name=cap /&gt;

In 2011, Martí opened negotiations with the [[European Union]] over various aspects of cooperation. During the negotiations, Andorra changed the foreign investment law, opening the country up to foreign investors, and also signed an agreement with France and Spain to avoid double taxation.&lt;ref name="prospects"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Prime Minister of Andorra Antoni Marti participated in the conference “Global economy prospects”, which took place in a Spanish city of La Seu D’ Urgell|url=http://all-andorra.com/prime-minister-andorra-antoni-marti-participated-conference-global-economy-prospects-took-place-spanish-city-la-seu-d-urgell/|accessdate=14 July 2016|work=All About Andorra|date=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martí has also overseen the introduction of the [[euro]] as the [[Andorra and the euro|official currency of Andorra]], following an agreement which was completed in June 2011. Andorra was permitted to issue their own euros from July 2013, but due to various delays, Andorran euros did not enter circulation until January 2015.&lt;ref name="coins"&gt;{{cite web|title=Andorran Euro Coins|url=https://www.fleur-de-coin.com/eurocoins/andorra-euro-coins|website=Fleur-de-Coin|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late May 2013, Martí met with [[François Hollande]], the [[President of France]] and a [[Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Prince of Andorra]], to inform him of his intentions to bring in a law to introduce personal income tax in Andorra. Hollande encouraged Martí to continue with economic reforms that may lead to growth.&lt;ref name="avec"&gt;{{cite web|title=Entretien avec M. Antoni MARTI et M. Gilbert SABOYA SUNYE|url=http://www.elysee.fr/communiques-de-presse/article/entretien-avec-m-antoni-marti-et-m-gilbert-saboya-sunye/|website=Elysee|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, Martí bowed to pressure from the European Union and did introduce a personal income tax for Andorrans.&lt;ref name=prof /&gt;

As Prime Minister, Martí oversaw the response to the 2015 Andorran banking crisis, involving American allegations of money laundering made against the [[Banca Privada d'Andorra]] (BPA). The government responded to this by the restructuring of the bank, and the creation and sale of Vall Banc in place of BPA. In June 2016, Martí praised [[Michel Camdessus]]'s 2005 report about Andorra, that "turned out to be prophetic." In turn, Camdessus expressed his respect "the government of Andorra for the fact that the Principality embarked on the path of reforms, turning from protectionism and stagnation in the direction of openness and competitiveness."&lt;ref name=prospects /&gt;

==Personal history==
Evans was born about 1607 in Llangelynin parish and was apprenticed to a tailor at Wrexham. While living in Wales he had seen visions and prophetic dreams which were accentuated when he went to London in 1629. In London he made vain efforts to warn [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] of perceived dangers, but succeeded in telling the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] to his face of his future promotions.&lt;ref name="NLoW"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-EVAN-ARI-1607.html |title=Biography of Arise Evans |author=Richards, Thomas |publisher=National Library of Wales|date= |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans became interested in the multifarious sects that flourished under the new liberty of Charles I's reign, opposing most of them, especially the tenets of the [[Fifth Monarchist]].&lt;ref name="NLoW"/&gt; He took particular offence towards  [[Christopher Feake]] and [[William Aspinwall]].&lt;ref name="NLoW"/&gt;

The '''Bodos''' ({{IPA-hns|boːɽoː|pron}}) are an [[ethnic]] and linguistic group of the [[Brahmaputra valley]] in the [[Northeast India|northeast]] part of India. 

'''Bodo''' Tribe of '''Assam''' - are known to be the '''earliest settlers of Assam''', and the first to cultivate rice and rear silkworms in Assam.  The word 'Bodo' has been derived from the word 'Bod' which means Tibet. The Bodos speak  the Bodo language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oknortheast.com/2010/12/bodos-earliest-settlers-of-assam.html|title=Bodos - the Earliest Settlers of Assam|work=OK! North East|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are recognized as a plains tribe in the Sixth Schedule of the [[Indian Constitution]]. [[Udalguri]], [[Chirang district|Chirang]], [[Baksa district|Baksa]], [[Sonitpur]], [[Goalpara]], Dhemaji, [[Lakhimpur district|Lakhimpur]], [[Kokrajhar]] of [[Assam]] are considered the centre of the Bodo People. The Bodos living in [[West Bengal]] are called [[Mech tribe|Mech]]. The Bodos use the term ''Bodo's'' (which is pronounced as Borosa meaning son of Bodo's) to describe themselves.

==Language==
The [[Bodo language|Boro language]] is one of the languages of the Sino-Tibetan or Tibeto-Chinese speech family. It belongs to the Boro, Naga group of the Assam-Burmese branch of the Sino Tibetan family.

Bodos traditionally practise [[Bathouism]], which is the worshiping of forefathers, known as Obonglaoree. The shijou plant (Euphorbia genus) is taken as the symbol of Bathou and worshiped. It is also claimed as the supreme god. In [[Bodo language]], Ba means five and thou means deep. As Bodos believe in five mighty elements of [[God]], which are Land, Water, Air, Fire and Sky, five has become a significant number in the Bathou religion.

The Shijou tree is encircled with eighteen pairs of designed bamboo sticks and five pairs of ring of bamboo. In front of Shijou within encircled bamboo ring there is a 'Dove Heart'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://udalguri.gov.in/bodo.htm|title=HOME|website=udalguri.gov.in|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the concept of Bathouism, before the creation of universe, there was simply a great void, in which the supreme being 'Aham Guru', Anan Binan Gosai or Obonglaoree existed formlessly. The supreme god Aham guru became tired of living formless existence and desired to live in flesh and blood. He descended on this great void with all human characteristics. Thereafter he created the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Boro Kachari Sonskritir Kinchit Abhas |last=Basumatary |first=Dhuparam |publisher= |year=|isbn= |location=|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

'''Ḥayyim ben Moshe ibn Attar''' also known as the '''Or ha-Ḥayyim''' after his popular commentary on the [[Pentateuch]], was a [[Talmud]]ist and [[Kabbalah|kabbalist]]; born at [[Meknes]], [[Morocco]], in 1696; died in [[Jerusalem]], [[Ottoman Empire]] on 7 July 1743. He was one of the most prominent [[rabbi]]s in Morocco.

In 1733 he decided to leave his native country and settle in [[Ottoman Syria]]. En route, he was detained in [[Livorno]] by the rich members of the Jewish community who established a [[yeshiva]] for him. Many of his pupils later became prominent and furnished him with funds to print his ''Or ha-Ḥayyim.'' (light of life)

Or ha-Ḥayyim was received with great honor wherever he traveled because of his extensive knowledge, keen intellect, and extraordinary piety. In the middle of 1742 he arrived in [[Jerusalem]], where he presided at the [[Beth Midrash]] Knesset Yisrael.

One of his disciples there was [[Chaim Yosef David Azulai]], who wrote of his master's greatness: "Attar's heart pulsated with Talmud; he uprooted mountains like a resistless torrent; his holiness was that of an angel of the Lord,... having severed all connection with the affairs of this world."{{cn|date=June 2018}}

He is buried in the [[Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery]] in Jerusalem, Israel.

#''Or ha-Ḥayyim'' (The Light of Life), Venice, 1742—a commentary on the [[Pentateuch]] after the four methods known collectively as [[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)|Pardes]]; it was reprinted several times. His renown is based chiefly on this work, which became popular also with the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]].
#''Peri Toar'' (Beautiful Fruit), ''novellae'' on the ''[[Shulḥan Arukh|Shulchan Aruch]],'' ''Yoreh De'ah,'' dealing especially with [[Hiskiah de Silva]]'s commentary ''Peri Ḥadash,'' Amsterdam, 1742; Vienna and Lemberg, 1810.
#''Rishon le-Zion,'' Constantinople, 1750—consisting of ''novellae'' to several Talmudic treatises, on certain portions of the ''Shulḥan Arukh,'' on the terminology of [[Maimonides]], on the five ''[[Megillot]],'' on the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]] and on ''[[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]].''
#Under the same title were published at Polna, 1804, his notes on ''[[Book of Joshua|Joshua]],'' ''[[Book of Judges|Judges]],'' ''[[Book of Samuel|Samuel]],'' and ''[[Isaiah]].''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51600">The '''[[Colorado House of Representatives]] career of [[Douglas Bruce]]''' began with Bruce's appointment to a vacant legislative seat in November 2007 and his swearing-in in January 2008; he was a focal point of controversy during his one term in the state house, becoming the first legislator in Colorado history to be officially censured. He was defeated in the Republican primary in his 2008 bid for a full term.

==2007 House appointment==
In October 2007, Bruce announced his plans to seek a seat in the [[Colorado House of Representatives]]. After Rep. [[Bill Cadman]] was appointed to fill a Senate seat vacated by [[Ron May (Colorado legislator)|Ron May]], Bruce sought to be appointed to Cadman's seat representing House District 15.&lt;ref name="looking"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ed |last=Sealover |title=A confident Bruce says he will seek appointment to house seat |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/bruce_28797___article.html/seat_county.html |work=Colorado Springs Gazette |date=October 23, 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026014616/http://www.gazette.com/articles/bruce_28797___article.html/seat_county.html |archivedate=October 26, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="opens"&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=McGhee |title=Senate move opens House to TABOR author |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/bruce_28797___article.html/seat_county.html |work=Denver Post |date=November 4, 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026014616/http://www.gazette.com/articles/bruce_28797___article.html/seat_county.html |archivedate=October 26, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce faced two other Republican challengers for the appointment during a short but contentious battle for the vacancy committee nomination, during which he questioned the professional credentials of one of his opponents, and opponents charged that he was too divisive a figure to successfully represent the district. Ultimately, Bruce received two-thirds of the votes from the 66 members of the vacancy committee, beating out former school board candidate and engineer Reginald Perry and businessman Steve Hasbrouck.&lt;ref name="wins"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ed |last=Sealover |title=GOP chooses Bruce to fill House seat |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/bruce_30390___article_pluck.html/seat_vacancy.html |work=Colorado Springs Gazette |date=3 December 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203181453/http://www.gazette.com/articles/bruce_30390___article_pluck.html/seat_vacancy.html |archivedate=3 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008 legislative session==

===Swearing-in controversy===

Bruce postponed being sworn in until January 14, 2008&amp;mdash;several days after the start of the legislative session&amp;mdash;in order to be eligible to serve a full four terms beyond the partial term under Colorado's [[term limits]] rules. The move was criticized by former Republican Senator Ron May and Democratic House Speaker [[Andrew Romanoff]],&lt;ref name="late"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ed |last=Sealover |title=Douglas Bruce plans a late start in house |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/bruce_30507___article.html/jan_seat.html |work=Colorado Springs Gazette |date=5 December 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524014053/http://www.gazette.com/articles/bruce_30507___article.html/jan_seat.html |archivedate=24 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who, in response to Bruce's actions, called for legislation requiring that newly appointed legislators be sworn in within a specific period of time.&lt;ref name="newlaw"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ed |last=Sealover |title=Bruce’s late show may inspire new law |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/bruce_31059___article.html/romanoff_house.html
|work=Colorado Springs Gazette |date=19 December 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a bill, which would require appointed legislators to be sworn in within 14 days of their selection, was introduced later in the session by Democratic Reps. [[Paul Weissmann]] and [[Dorothy Butcher]];&lt;ref name="swearingbill"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Davidson |title=Bill aims to head off Bruce-like late shows |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/state_33394___article.html/weissmann_bill.html |work=Colorado Springs Gazette |date=22 February 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328090655/http://www.gazette.com/articles/state_33394___article.html/weissmann_bill.html |archivedate=28 March 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce took the unusual step for a legislator of testifying against the bill at a committee hearing,&lt;ref name="tread"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jennifer |last=Brown |title=Bruce: Don't tread on me |url=http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_8483164
|work=Denver Post |date=7 March 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the bill passed the state house, with Bruce casting the only dissenting vote.&lt;ref name="takeoff"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Davidson |title=House OKs bill requiring legislators to take office within 14 days |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/bill_35093___article.html/bruce_law.html |work=Colorado Springs Gazette |date=9 April 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411055622/http://www.gazette.com/articles/bill_35093___article.html/bruce_law.html |archivedate=11 April 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce clashed with legislative leaders over the time of his swearing-in, demanding to be sworn in at 10 a.m. in front of the full house. Both Speaker Romanoff and Republican leader [[Mike May (Colorado politician)|Mike May]] requested that Bruce take the oath at a different time, as is customary for vacancy appointments, in order not to interfere with House business.&lt;ref name="disrupt"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ed |last=Sealover |title=Bruce wants things his way |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/house_31855___article.html/bruce_romanoff.html |work=The Colorado Springs Gazette |date=12 January 2008 |accessdate=2008-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115085415/http://www.gazette.com/articles/house_31855___article.html/bruce_romanoff.html |archivedate=15 January 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="demands"&gt;{{cite news |first=Alan |last=Gathright |title=Bruce demands audience for oath |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/jan/12/bruce-demands-audience-for-oath/

After House Republicans voted 22-1 to call for a representative to be named for District 15 if Bruce did not take the oath of office by the end of the day, Bruce was sworn in by Romanoff at 1:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="kicking"&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Barge |author2=Alan Gathright |title=Bruce alive and kicking in House |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/jan/14/bruce-kicks-photographer/

Already fined for an unexcused absence from the commission meeting on Monday morning, Bruce submitted his resignation as an [[El Paso County, Colorado|El Paso County]] Commissioner after being sworn in as a state representative, effective January 15.&lt;ref name="foot"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jennier |last=Brown |title=Kick helps get Bruce off on wrong foot with colleagues |url=http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_7972150

===Censure===
On the morning before he was sworn in, Bruce was present on the house floor during the session's morning prayer. Javier Manzano, a ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' photographer, took Bruce's picture during the prayer; Bruce kicked him in the knee, telling Manzano, "Do not do that again." Bruce later accused the photographer of "violating the order and decorum" of the house and refused to apologize. Republican Minority Leader Mike May issued a formal apology to the photographer, and state Republican chairman [[Dick Wadhams]] "strongly denounce[d]" Bruce's actions.&lt;ref name="kicksup"&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Barge |title=House kicks up an investigation |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/jan/15/this-isnt-over-leader-may-says/
|work=Rocky Mountain News |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=2008-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaker Romanoff and Minority Leader May convened a bipartisan six-member panel to investigate and made recommendations concerning the incident;&lt;ref name="panel"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jennifer |last=Brown |title=House panel steps into kicking incident |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_7980951
|work=Denver Post |date=16 January 2008 |accessdate=2008-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on Friday, January 18, the panel recommended 6-0 that Bruce be censured by the House for his actions, and 5-1 that a formal apology be requested from Bruce.&lt;ref name="chides"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jennifer |last=Brown |title=House panel chides Bruce over kick |url=http://origin.denverpost.com/rapids/ci_8010233?_requestid=1919337

Romanoff elected to pursue the censure recommendation, and, on January 24, the full House of Representatives voted 62-1 (with only Rep. [[Kevin Lundberg]] opposed) to censure Bruce. He became the first representative in the recorded history of the state house to be formally censured.&lt;ref name="censure"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff Reports |title=House censures Douglas Bruce |url=http://www.denverpost.com/rapids/ci_8066076

For the 2008 session of the Colorado General Assembly, Bruce was named to seats on the House Finance Committee and the House State, Veterans, and Military Affairs Committee.&lt;ref name="cmte2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2008a/directory.nsf/HouCommWp?OpenView |title=House Committees of Reference |accessdate=2008-01-19 |work=Colorado General Assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of the 2008 General Assembly session, before being sworn in, Bruce announced his opposition to a large portion of the House Republican caucus legislative agenda, including a [[sales tax holiday]] for school supplies, a [[pine beetle]] mitigation fund, new specialty [[license plates]], and targeted [[tax credits]], noting in a letter to Republican [[whip]] [[Cory Gardner]]: "I thought the GOP was the party of less government and more freedom, of protecting individualism, not streamlining socialism."&lt;ref name="nonono"&gt;{{cite news |first=Cara |last=DeGette |title=Douglas Bruce's Message To His Party: No!

The first bill introduced by Bruce during the 2008 session was a measure to require the Colorado Department of Education to distribute copies of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and [[U.S. Constitution]] to high school seniors, to mandate classroom instruction on the documents,&lt;ref name="declar"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ed |last=Sealover |title=Assembly Glance: Thursday in review |url=http://origin.denverpost.com/rapids/ci_8010233?_requestid=1919337

Another of Bruce's bills, which would have prohibited counties from assessing any charges other than property taxes, including fines for delinquent payments or stormwater fees, on property tax bills, was also killed in committee.&lt;ref name="tuesday"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ed |last=Sealover |author2=Michael Davidson |title=Tuesday in the General Assembly |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/tax_33336___article.html/colorado_bruce.html |work=Colorado Springs Gazette |date=19 February 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524014148/http://www.gazette.com/articles/tax_33336___article.html/colorado_bruce.html |archivedate=24 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce also advanced a measure which would have eliminated ''[[per diem]]'' expense payments for legislators and indexed legislators' pay to inflation, as well as requiring voter approval for any pay increases above this amount.&lt;ref name="limit"&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press |title=Colo.

Bruce has also objected to the practice of attaching a "safety clause" to bills, a provision which uses a declaration that the bill is "necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety" to change the date of enactment and prohibit challenges to the legislation via the petition process. He has pledged to vote against all legislation containing an unjustified safety clause,&lt;ref name="safety"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff Reports |title=Bruce rips legislation's "safety clause." |url=http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_7981831

|work=Colorado Springs Gazette |date=16 January 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce's amendments often failed on account of legislators' personal hostility towards him; on at least one occasion, after the house voted down his proposal to strike the safety clause, the motion passed after being introduced by another legislator.&lt;ref name="pariah"/&gt; House members eventually developed the practice of supporting the removal of the safety clause if the legislator sponsoring the bill agreed; in 2008, 41% of bill passed had no safety clause, up from 25% the previous year.&lt;ref name="smallchange"&gt;{{cite news|first=Joe |last=Hanel |title=Bruce wins small changes on "safety clause" |url=http://durangoherald.com/asp-bin/article_generation.asp?article_type=news&amp;article_path=/news/08/news080628_6.htm |work=Durango Herald |date=28 June 2008 |accessdate=2008-07-20 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce also proposed several changes to House operations and procedure, including use of [[taser]]s by state capitol security&amp;mdash;a proposal received favorably by legislative leaders&lt;ref name="taser"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ed |last=Sealover |title=Bruce plan for Tasers welcomed; request for bigger office isn't |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/bruce_34140___article.html/office_capitol.html

Bruce also joined with left-leaning and environmental groups in opposing proposed changes to Colorado's petition process that would raise signature requirements and make it more difficult to put proposals to amend the Colorado state constitution on the statewide ballot.&lt;ref name="tougher"&gt;{{cite news|first=Joe |last=Hanel |title=Panel: Make it tougher to amend constitution |url=http://durangoherald.com/asp-bin/article_generation.asp?article_type=news&amp;article_path=/news/08/news080410_7.htm |work=Durango Herald |date=10 April 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-11 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="libbruce"&gt;{{cite news|first=Joe |last=Hanel |title=Liberal groups, Bruce join forces |url=http://durangoherald.com/asp-bin/article_generation.asp?article_type=news&amp;article_path=/news/08/news080502_4.htm |work=Durango Herald |date=2 May 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-02 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce also entered into debate on, and voted against, a bill to impose new requirements on [[landlord]]s and set standards for rental properties. His actions generated criticism from other legislators, who argued that Bruce should have recused himself from voting on the measure because his ownership of rental properties created a [[conflict of interest]]; two other legislators recused themselves for similar reasons.&lt;ref name="tenant"&gt;{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Hoover |title=House gives initial OK to bill on tenant rights |url=http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_9031511 |work=Denver Post |date=24 April 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="defendst"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff Reports |title=Bruce Defends Voting On Landlord-Tenant Bill |url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/15983568/detail.html |work=TheDenverChannel.com |date=24 April 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal from committee===
On February 13, Bruce, alone among 100 state legislators, refused to sign on as a cosponsor to an annual joint resolution recognizing [[Military and Veterans Appreciation Day]]. Bruce had protested other resolutions in the legislature as a waste of time,&lt;ref name="snubs"&gt;{{cite news |first=Alan |last=Gathright |author2=Daniel J.

|work=Rocky Mountain News |date=13 February 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to his practice of refusing to vote on resolutions as an El Paso County commissioner.&lt;ref name="riles2"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ed |last=Sealover |title=Bruce riles GOP over veterans resolution |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/bruce_33094___article.html/veterans_resolution.html |work=Colorado Springs Gazette |date=14 February 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220001908/http://www.gazette.com/articles/bruce_33094___article.html/veterans_resolution.html |archivedate=20 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the session, Bruce proposed a change to House rules to allow members to abstain from voting on resolutions.&lt;ref name="view2"&gt;{{cite news |author=Editorial Board |title=Our View - Friday |url=http://www.gazette.com/opinion/tax_34208___article.html/increase_colorado.html

In response to public complaints, Republican Minority Leader Mike May removed Bruce from the House State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee, which oversees veterans' issues.

The following week, Bruce signed on as a cosponsor to an annual resolution calling for civility between members of the legislature; he said that it did not violate his standard of refusing to support symbolic resolutions because he considered the measure to be a "pledge of personal behavior."&lt;ref name="civil"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff Reports | title=House resolves to be civil, Bruce votes aye |url=http://www.denverpost.com/lacrosse/ci_8304878

===Per diem controversy===
As a legislator, Bruce was entitled to apply for ''[[per diem]]'' compensation for living expenses during the legislative session. After having delayed his swearing into the state house for five days after the start of the session, Bruce applied for and received compensation for those days amounting to $750 more than what he was legally entitled to.

==="Illiterate peasants" comments===
On April 21, 2008, Bruce voiced opposition during house debate on a bill sponsored by Rep. [[Marsha Looper]] to create a [[guest worker program]] to facilitate temporary employment visas for agricultural workers from Mexico. After speaking against [[illegal immigration]] and being advised to restrict comments to the bill by debate chair Rep. [[Kathleen Curry]], Bruce took the floor a second time and commented:
{{quote|I would like to have the opportunity to state at the microphone why I don't think we need 5,000 more illiterate peasants in Colorado.}}

Bruce was immediately [[gavel]]led to order by Rep. Curry, who ruled that he would no longer be recognized during debate on the bill.&lt;ref name="peasants"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff Reports |title=Bruce: Illegal immigrant workers are 'illiterate peasants'

Bruce defended his remarks as being factually accurate, citing dictionary definitions of "illiterate" and "peasant".

Several days later, Bruce submitted an amendment &amp;mdash; facetiously drafted by the "linguistic sensitivity codification commission" &amp;mdash; to another bill addressing immigration issues to substitute "undocumented, temporary guest resident" in place of "illegal aliens" in statutory language. The amendment was offered and defeated twice.&lt;ref name="pc"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jessica |last=Fender |title=A new, improved and PC Bruce |url=http://www.politicswest.com/23776/new_improved_and_pc_bruce |work=Denver Post |date=25 April 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sensitive"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeremy |last=Pelzer |title=Bruce shows his sensitive side |url=http://www.politickerco.com/jeremypelzer/1006/bruce-shows-his-sensitive-side |work=PolitickerCO |date=25 April 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual harassment complaint===
On April 30, Bruce was the subject of a sexual harassment complaint after a female legislative staffer alleged that he made inappropriate verbal comments towards her. After being formally confronted by House Speaker [[Andrew Romanoff]], Bruce was instructed to stay away from the woman who filed the complaint, according to reports by other representatives.&lt;ref name="complaint"&gt;{{cite news |first=Lynn |last=Bartels |title=Woman files sexual harassment complaint against embattled Bruce |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/apr/30/female-staffer-lodges-complaint-against-bruce/ |work=Rocky Mountain News |date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="files"&gt;{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Schrager |title=Bruce accused of sexually harassing staffer |url=http://www.9news.com/news/top-article.aspx?storyid=90954 |work=9News.com |date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-30 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="accuses"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jessica |last=Fender |title=Sources: Staffer accuses Bruce of sex harassment |url=http://www.denverpost.com/commented/ci_9114126?source=commented-news |work=Denver Post |date=1 May 2008 |accessdate=2008-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislative leaders refused to publicly discuss the complaint,&lt;ref name="complaint2"&gt;{{cite news |first=Jessica |last=Fender |title=Complaint against Rep.

Bruce faced criticism from House Democratic and Republican leaders in April for distributing campaign fliers critical of Waller to Republican representatives on the House floor. Although not a violation of the law or House rules, legislative leaders denounced the action as a breach of decorum and tradition.&lt;ref name="fire"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ed |last=Sealover |title=Bruce draws fire over fliers |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/bruce_34830___article.html/house_fliers.html |work=Colorado Springs Gazette |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524020632/http://www.gazette.com/articles/bruce_34830___article.html/house_fliers.html |archivedate=24 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rebuke"&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Ingold |author2=Jessica Fender |title=Bruce fliers bring rebuke |url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_8774429 |work=Denver Post |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Waller also called for Bruce's resignation in April 2008, after Bruce's controversial comments about Mexican guest workers.&lt;ref name="noprobe"/&gt; Bruce, in response, characterised Waller as a "conformer" rather than a "reformer," and stated that his controversial actions were designed to draw attention to inappropriate legislative actions.&lt;ref name="lipsink"&gt;{{cite news |first=Karen E. |last=Crummy |title=Bruce's lip sinking his ship? |url=http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_9099564 |work=Denver Post |date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the August primary, Bruce was again criticized by Waller for mailing flyers promoting his charity, Active Citizens Together, soliciting volunteers and donations for the charity and stating: "to reform government, ACT with Douglas Bruce." Although Waller declared that the flyers were "an obvious attempt at campaigning," he did not file a complaint with the [[Colorado Secretary of State]]'s office, as he believed no laws were actually broken; the flyers did not mention any of Bruce's elected positions.&lt;ref name="jugular"&gt;{{cite news |first=Pam |last=Zubeck |title=Politigab: Jeff Crank launches another radio ad |url=http://www.gazette.com/news/bruce_38016___article_news.html/waller_act.html |work=Colorado Springs Gazette |date=8 July 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130124172108/http://www.gazette.com/news/bruce_38016___article_news.html/waller_act.html |archivedate=24 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce was also criticized for listing endorsements on his website from political officials who had endorsed his campaign for county commissioner, but not specifically endorsed his legislative campaign. After attention was called to the discrepancy, Bruce had the erroneous endorsements removed, citing an "overzealous webmaster."&lt;ref name="sayendor"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ed |last=Sealover |title=Backers named on Bruce Web site say endorsement from 2004  |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/jul/21/backers-named-bruce-web-site-say-endorsement-2004/ |work=Rocky Mountain News |date=21 July 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, Bruce filed several campaign finance complaints against Waller, all but one of which&amp;mdash;an accusation that Waller improperly accepted a corporate donation&amp;mdash;were dismissed.&lt;ref name="faceoff"/&gt; The hearing on Bruce's complaint was postponed until after the primary, over Bruce's objection, but resulted in Waller being cited and fined for failing to disclose a campaign contribution.&lt;ref name="failing"&gt;{{cite news |first=Perry |last=Swanson |title=Waller campaign fined for failing to report funds |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/waller_40196___article.html/campaign_schuck.html |work=Colorado Springs Gazette |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606140434/http://www.gazette.com/articles/waller_40196___article.html/campaign_schuck.html |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce also criticized Waller for his failure to vote in several recent elections, including the 2004 general election.&lt;ref name="faceoff"&gt;{{cite news |first=Perry |last=Swanson |title=Bruce, Waller face off |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/face_38692___article.html/republican_candidates.html |work=Colorado Springs Gazette |date=27 July 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524020810/http://www.gazette.com/articles/face_38692___article.html/republican_candidates.html |archivedate=24 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce was narrowly defeated for the Republican nomination in the August 12 party primary, taking only 48 percent of the vote to Waller's 52 percent.&lt;ref name="defeats"&gt;{{cite news |first=Perry |last=Swanson |title=Waller defeats Bruce |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/bruce_39268___article_news.html/waller_republican.html |work=Colorado Springs Gazette |date=12 August 2008 |accessdate=2008-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130124002040/http://www.gazette.com/articles/bruce_39268___article_news.html/waller_republican.html |archivedate=24 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Democrat Allison Hunter withdrew from the race in December 2007, arguing that Bruce's appointment by a vacancy committee gave him "too great an advantage" in general election;&lt;ref name="hunter"&gt;{{cite news |first=Carlyn Ray |last=Mitchell |title=Dem opens bid for commission seat |url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/hunter_33631___article.html/county_seat.html

{{History of Equatorial Guinea}}

'''Francisco Macías Nguema''' (born '''Mez-m Ngueme'''; [[Africanisation|Africanised]] to '''Masie Nguema Biyogo Ñegue Ndong'''; 1 January 1924 – 29 September 1979) was the first [[President of Equatorial Guinea|President]] of [[Equatorial Guinea]], from 1968 until his [[1979 Equatorial Guinea coup d'état|overthrow]] and subsequent execution in 1979.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

==Early life==
Born as Mez-m Ngueme, Macías Nguema was the son of a [[witch doctor]] who allegedly killed his younger brother. He belonged to the country's majority [[Fang people|Fang]] ethnic group.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

As a boy of 9, Nguema saw his father punched to death by a Spanish colonial administrator when he tried to use his title of chief to negotiate for better wages for his people. Nguema was orphaned a week later when his mother committed suicide, leaving the boy and 10 siblings to fend for themselves.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

==Early political career==
Macías Nguema failed the civil service exam three times.&lt;ref name=Pariah&gt;{{cite web |title=The Pariah President: Teodoro Obiang is a brutal dictator responsible for thousands of deaths. So why is he treated like an elder statesman on the world stage? |first=Dan |last=Gardner |date=6 November 2005 |publisher=The Ottawa Citizen (reprint: dangardner.ca) |url=http://www.dangardner.ca/Featnov605.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080612161320/http://www.dangardner.ca/Featnov605.html |archivedate = 12 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he eventually rose to the position of mayor of [[Mongomo]] under the Spanish colonial government, and later served as a member of the territorial parliament. In 1964, he was named deputy prime minister of the autonomous transition government. He ran for president of the soon-to-be independent country against Prime Minister [[Bonifacio Ondó Edu]] on a strongly nationalist platform in [[Equatorial Guinean general election, 1968|1968]]. In what has been the only free election held in the country to date, he defeated Ondó Edu in the runoff and was sworn in as president on 12 October. Ondó Edu briefly went into exile in Gabon, and was officially reported to have committed suicide on 5 March 1969, although Edu has been reported to have actually been executed soon after his return on trumped-up charges of having had been planning a coup.&lt;ref name="afroarticles.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afroarticles.com/article-dashboard/Article/Macias-Nguema--Ruthless-and-bloody-dictator/117291|title=Macias Nguema: Ruthless and bloody dictator|publisher=Afroarticles.com|accessdate=1 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104035212/http://www.afroarticles.com/article-dashboard/Article/Macias-Nguema--Ruthless-and-bloody-dictator/117291|archivedate=4 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==
On 7 May 1971, Macías Nguema issued Decree 415, which repealed parts of the 1968 Constitution and granted him "all direct powers of Government and Institutions", including powers formerly held by the legislative and judiciary branches, as well as the cabinet of ministers. On 18 October 1971, Law 1 imposed the death penalty as punishment for threatening the President or the government. Insulting or offending the President or his cabinet was punishable by 30 years in prison. On 14 July 1972, a presidential decree merged all existing political parties into the United National Party (later the United National Workers' Party), with Macías Nguema as [[President for Life]] of both nation and party.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

In a plebiscite [[Equatorial Guinean constitutional referendum, 1973|held on 29 July 1973]], the 1968 Constitution was replaced with a new document that gave Macías Nguema absolute power and formally made his party the only one legally permitted in the country. According to official figures, an implausible 99 percent of voters approved the new document. Three months later, [[Equatorial Guinean presidential election, 1973|a fresh "presidential election"]] confirmed Macías Nguema as president for life.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

Macías Nguema declared private education subversive, and banned it entirely with Decree 6 on 18 March 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.opensourceguinea.org/2013/10/artucio-arturo-trial-of-macias-in.html |title=The Trial of Macias in Equatorial Guinea |publisher=International Commission of Jurists |author=Alejandro Artucio |pages= 6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his presidency, his country was nicknamed "the [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]] of Africa".&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Adam. The Wonga Coup, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; He was known to order entire families and villages executed.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

Three important pillars of his rule were the United National Workers' Party, the [[Juventud en Marcha con Macías]] militia/youth group, and the [[Esangui]] clan of [[Río Muni]]. The country's instruments of repression (military, presidential bodyguard) were entirely controlled by Macías Nguema's relatives and clan members. The president's paranoid actions included mandating the death of those who wore spectacles,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3610187/If-you-think-this-ones-bad-you-should-have-seen-his-uncle.html If you think this one's bad you should have seen his uncle]&lt;/ref&gt; banning use of the word "intellectual" and destroying boats to stop his people fleeing from his rule&lt;ref name=Pariah/&gt; (fishing was banned).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Equatorial Guinea Background Info |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/destinations/africa/equatorial-guinea/essential?a=culture |year=2007 |publisher=Lonely Planet |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309031011/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/worldguide/destinations/africa/equatorial-guinea/essential?a=culture |archivedate=9 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The only road out of the country on the mainland was also mined.&lt;ref name="Roberts, Adam page 20"&gt;Roberts, Adam. The Wonga Coup, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; He Africanised his name to '''Masie Nguema Biyogo Ñegue Ndong''' in 1976 after demanding that the rest of the Equatoguinean population replace their Hispanic names with African names. He also banned Western medicines, stating that they were un-African.&lt;ref name="Roberts, Adam page 20"/&gt;

Macías Nguema was the centre of an extreme [[cult of personality]], perhaps fueled by his consumption of copious amounts of ''[[bhang]]''&lt;ref name="afroarticles.com"/&gt; and ''[[iboga]]'',&lt;ref name=Pariah/&gt; and assigned himself titles such as the "Unique Miracle" and "Grand Master of Education, Science, and Culture". The island of Fernando Pó had its name Africanised after him to Masie Ngueme Biyogo Island; upon his overthrow in 1979, its name was again changed to [[Bioko]]. The capital, Santa Isabel, had its name changed to [[Malabo]]. In 1978, he changed the [[national motto]] to "There is no other God than Macías Nguema".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afroarticles.com/article-dashboard/article.php?id=117291 |title=Macias Nguema: Ruthless and bloody dictator |publisher=Afroarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313200255/http://afroarticles.com/article-dashboard/article.php?id=117291 |archivedate=13 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Macías Nguema's government, the country had neither a development plan nor an accounting system for government funds. After the killing of the governor of the Central Bank, he carried everything that remained in the national treasury to his house in a rural village.&lt;ref name="afroarticles.com"/&gt; On Christmas Eve of 1969 about 150 of his opponents were killed. Soldiers executed them by shooting at the football stadium in [[Malabo]], while amplifiers were playing [[Mary Hopkin]]'s song "[[Those Were the Days (song)|Those Were the Days]]."&lt;ref name="Cronjé1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Suzanne Cronjé|title=Equatorial Guinea, the forgotten dictatorship: forced labour and political murder in central Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=8GN0AAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=christmas|year=1976|publisher=Anti-Slavery Society|isbn=978-0-900918-05-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macías Nguema's government forced tens of thousands of citizens to flee in fear of persecution and to protect their personal safety. Intellectuals and skilled professionals were a particular target, due to which human rights researcher Robert af Klinteberg, in a 1978 study that examined the government's repression in detail, called it a policy of "deliberate cultural regression." Af Klinteberg reported that as of 1978, at least 101,000 persons, out of a contemporary population that the World Bank estimates totalled 215,284 persons—nearly 47% of the population—had fled the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/87904103/Equatorial-Guinea-macias-Country-klinteberg Robert af Klinteberg, "Equatorial Guinea--Macias Country: The Forgotten Refugees," Geneva, International University Exchange Fund, 1978.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.worldbank.org/country/equatorial-guinea World Bank, "Equatorial Guinea," World Development Indicators; see download file.]&lt;/ref&gt; Other reporting, such as a 1979 Time magazine account stating that "perhaps 150,000" persons fled, suggests that the proportion of the population that sought safety in exile may have approached 70%, based on the World Bank's estimate of the population in 1979.&lt;ref name="time20aug1979"&gt;{{cite news |title=Despot's Fall |date=20 August 1979 |work=TIME Magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,947351,00.html?promoid=googlep}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the end of his rule, nearly all of the country's educated class was either executed or forced into exile—a [[brain drain]] from which the country has never recovered. Two-thirds of the legislature and 10 of his original ministers were also killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Today Series: Africa 2012|last=Dickovick |first=J. Tyler |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Lanham, Maryland |ISBN=978-1-61048-881-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some observers have posited that Macías Nguema may have been a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]], a disorder potentially enabled, in part, by reported childhood [[psychological trauma]], and that his behaviour could have been affected by other possible mental illnesses, as well as his reported periodic use of the psychoactive plant [[Tabernanthe_iboga|Iboga]] and large quantities of [[Cannabis_(drug)|cannabis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/community/culctr/culctr_guinea040209_ivbcasavis.pdf David Casavis, “Teasing Out Psychopathic Behaviors of African Leaders: Francisco Macías”], conference paper presented at "[http://www.hofstra.edu/community/culctr/culctr_events_equatorial_guinea.html Between Three Continents: Rethinking Equatorial Guinea on the Fortieth Anniversary of its Independence from Spain]," 2009, at Hofstra University's Cultural Center.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rene Pelissier, "Equatorial Guinea: Autopsy of a Miracle," Africa Report, Vol. 25, No. 3, May-June 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overthrow==
By 1979, Macías Nguema's government had garnered condemnations from the [[United Nations]] and [[European Commission]]. That summer, Macías Nguema organised the execution of several members of his own family, leading several members of his inner circle to fear that he was no longer acting rationally. On 3 August 1979 he was overthrown by [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]], who was Macías Nguema's nephew (and the brother of one of the victims) and who served previously as the military governor of [[Bioko]] and Vice-Minister of the Armed Forces.&lt;ref name=Pariah/&gt;

The deposed ruler and a contingent of loyal forces initially resisted the coup, but his forces eventually abandoned him, and he was captured in a forest on 18 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.opensourceguinea.org/2013/10/artucio-arturo-trial-of-macias-in.html |title=The Trial of Macias in Equatorial Guinea |publisher=International Commission of Jurists |author=Alejandro Artucio |page= 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his overthrow, he sent his three minor children (Monica, Maribel, and Paco) to [[North Korea]] for safety. They lived there for the remainder of their childhood and now live in various other countries.&lt;ref name="Kids"/&gt;

==Trial and execution==
The Supreme Military Council opened Case 1/979 on 18 August 1979, and began interviewing witnesses and collecting evidence against the Macías Nguema government. The Council subsequently convened a [[military tribunal]] on 24 September to try Macías Nguema and several members of his government. The charges for the ten [[defendant]]s included [[genocide]], [[mass murder]], [[embezzlement]] of public funds, violations of human rights, and [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.opensourceguinea.org/2013/10/artucio-arturo-trial-of-macias-in.html |title=The Trial of Macias in Equatorial Guinea |publisher=International Commission of Jurists |author=Alejandro Artucio |pages= 20–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state prosecutor requested that Macías Nguema receive the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]], five others receive thirty years in prison, and four others receive a year in prison. Macías Nguema's defence counsel countered that the other co-defendants were responsible for specific crimes, and asked for acquittal. Macías Nguema himself delivered a statement to the court outlining what he viewed as the extensive good deeds he had performed for the country. At noon on 29 September 1979, the Tribunal delivered its sentences, which were more severe than what the prosecution had requested. Macías Nguema and six of his co-defendants were sentenced to death and the confiscation of their property; Nguema being sentenced to death '101 times'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/teodoro-obiang-nguema-a-brutal-bizarre-jailer-448575.html |location=London |work=The Independent  | first=Steve | last=Bloomfield | title=Teodoro Obiang Nguema: A brutal, bizarre jailer | date=13 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two defendants were sentenced to fourteen years in prison each, and two others to four years each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Trial of Macias in Equatorial Guinea |publisher=International Commission of Jurists |author=Alejandro Artucio |pages= 52–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With no higher court available to hear appeals, the decision of the Special Military Tribunal was final. Macías Nguema and the six other defendants sentenced to death were executed by a hired [[Moroccan Army]] firing squad at [[Black Beach Prison]] at 6&amp;nbsp;pm on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.opensourceguinea.org/2013/10/artucio-arturo-trial-of-macias-in.html |title=The Trial of Macias in Equatorial Guinea |publisher=International Commission of Jurists |author=Alejandro Artucio |pages= 54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John B. Quigley (2006) ''The Genocide Convention: An International Law Analysis'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd, {{ISBN|0-7546-4730-7}}.

Depending on the source, during his government, anywhere from 50,000 to 80,000 of the 300,000 to 400,000 people living in the country at the time were killed. According to [[Pennsylvania State University]] professor Randall Fegley, this was proportionally worse than the Nazis' rampage through Europe.&lt;ref name=Pariah/&gt; He has been compared to [[Pol Pot]] because of the violent, unpredictable, and anti-intellectual nature of his government.&lt;ref name="afroarticles.com"/&gt;

'''Grigori Naumovich Voitinsky''', born '''Zarkhin''' ({{Lang-ru|Григорий Наумович Войтинский}}; 1893-1953) A Bolshevik [[Comintern]] Official. He was sent to [[China]] in 1920 as an Senior advisor to contact the Top prominent Chinese Communists such as [[Chen Duxiu]], just before the formation of the [[Communist Party of China]]. The process of forming the Communist Party can be mostly attributed to his influence, although his successor advisors had more influence about the official Party line itself, such as allying with the [[Guomindang]].

He was born on 17 April 1893 in [[Nevel (town)|Nevel]] to a Russian Jewish Family. In 1918, he joined the Bolshevik Party. He took an active part in the [[Far Eastern Front in the Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Yoshihiro Ishikawa, ''The Formation of the Chinese Communist Party''. Columbia University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work in China ==
In 1920, the [[Soviet Union]] established the Far Eastern Bureau in [[Siberia]], a branch of the Third Communist International, or the [[Comintern]]. He was directly responsible for managing the establishment of a Communist party in China and other far east countries. Soon after its establishment, the bureau's deputy manager Voitinsky arrived in [[Beijing]] and contacted the Communist vanguard [[Li Dazhao]]. Li arranged for Voitinsky to meet with another Communist leader, [[Chen Duxiu]], in [[Shanghai]]. In August 1920, Voitinsky, Chen Duxiu, [[Li Hanjun]], [[Shen Xuanlu]], [[Yu Xiusong]], [[Shi Cuntong]], and others began to establish the Comintern China Branch.

The ''[[Shanghai Chronicle]]'' was set up in 1919 in Shanghai by [[Shemeshko]] and other Russians with [[socialism|socialist]] leanings, and received financial aid from the Soviet Russian government in early 1920. In the spring of 1920, Voitinsky and his colleagues came to China on a mission to establish the Communist Party in China. They not only came to China in the guise of editors and reporters for the newspaper, but also set up the Comintern's East Asia Secretariat in the newspaper office. From then on, the ''Shanghai Chronicle'' became both a propaganda vehicle for the East Asia Secretariat and a cover for [[Bolshevik]] activity in China. Because the newspaper staff assisted Soviet Russian and Comintern personnel stationed under cover at the newspaper in activities to establish a communist organization in China, the newspaper as a whole played a special role in the early communist movement in China. Although the ''Shanghai Chronicle'' stopped publication at the end of 1922 because Russian aid came to an end, many staff members continued to work for Bolshevism.&lt;ref&gt;Frank L. Britton ''Behind Communism''. University of Michigan, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later career ==
He worked as Comintern representative until 1926.  Then worked in the Siberian government in [[Irkutsk]] until 1929, when he moved to Moscow, where he worked in various orientalist institutions.  In 1934 he became a professor in [[Moscow State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pseudology.org/Bolsheviki_lenintsy/Voitinsky_Zaxrin.htm]| Biography (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

He is considered one of the founders of Soviet [[Sinology]]. He wrote several books about contemporary China politics.  He died in 1953 during an unsuccessful surgical operation.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-E0311-0010-003, Oberstes Gericht, Fischer-Prozess, Aussage, Fischer.jpg|thumb|right|Horst Fischer (at the board), 11 March 1966]]
'''Horst Paul Silvester Fischer''' (31 December 1912 – 8 July 1966) was a German [[Physician|doctor]] and member of the [[SS]], executed in [[East Germany]] for crimes committed at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/en/horst_fischer_19121966|title=Horst Fischer|work=Wollheim Memorial|publisher=Goethe University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Fischer was born and orphaned and grew up with relatives in [[Dresden]] and [[Berlin]]. After attending medical school at the [[University of Berlin]], Fischer received his medical degree in 1937. He had joined the [[SS]] in 1933, at the age of 20, and the Nazi Party four years later. He was transferred to Auschwitz-Birkenau in November 1942, where he became one of the highest-ranking physicians and participated at selections at the ramp from arriving trains. From November 1943 to September 1944 he was the main camp doctor in the infirmary of the [[Monowitz concentration camp]]. After the war he practised medicine in the [[German Democratic Republic]] for 20 years before trials of war criminals brought his identity into the light. He was tried by the [[Supreme Court of East Germany|GDR Supreme Court]], found guilty and sentenced to death. After the Chairman of the State Council [[Walter Ulbricht]] refused clemency, Fischer was executed by [[guillotine]] (called ''Fallschwertmaschine'' in the GDR) in [[Leipzig]] on 8 July 1966. He was the last person executed by this method in Germany and the last in Europe outside France, where [[Hamida Djandoubi|the last beheading]] occurred in 1977.

'''Dajian Huineng''' ({{CJKV|c=大鑒惠能|p=Dàjiàn Huìnéng|w=Ta&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-chien&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;|j=Daikan Enō|k=Hyeneung}}; 638–713), also commonly known as '''the Sixth Patriarch''' or '''Sixth Ancestor''' of [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]], is a semi-legendary but central figure in the early history of Chinese [[Chan Buddhism]]. He was said to have been an uneducated layman who suddenly [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|attained awakening]] upon hearing the [[Diamond Sutra]]. Despite his lack of formal training, he demonstrated his understanding to the fifth patriarch, [[Daman Hongren]], who then supposedly chose Huineng as his true successor instead of his publicly known selection of [[Yuquan Shenxiu]]. Twentieth century scholarship revealed that the story of Huineng's Buddhist career was likely invented by the monk [[Heze Shenhui]], who claimed to be one of Huineng's disciples and was highly critical of Shenxiu's teaching. Huineng is regarded as the founder of the "Sudden Enlightenment" Southern Chan school of Buddhism, which focuses on an immediate and direct attainment of Buddhist enlightenment. The ''[[Platform Sutra|Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch]]'' ({{zh|s=|t=六祖壇經|labels=no}}), which is said to be a record of his teachings, is a highly influential text in the East Asian Buddhist tradition.

==Biography==
Most modern scholars doubt the historicity of traditional biographies and works written about Huineng. The two primary sources for Huineng's life are the preface to the ''[[Platform Sutra]]''&lt;ref&gt;Pine 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Transmission of the Lamp]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=释道原|chapter=卷五·慧能|title=景德传灯录|url=http://www.guoxue.com/fxyj/jdcdl/jdcd_005.htm|publisher=北京国学时代文化传播有限公司|location=Beijing, China|date=|accessdate=25 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life of Huineng===
According to Huineng's autobiography in the Platform Sutra, Huineng's father was from Fanyang, but he was banished from his government position and passed away at a young age.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/173243878|title=Zen sourcebook : traditional documents from China, Korea, and Japan|last=|first=|date=2008|publisher=Hackett Pub.

One day, Huineng delivered firewood to a customer's shop, where he met a man reciting the Diamond Sutra. He inquired about the reason that the Diamond Sutra was chanted, and the person stated that he came from the Eastern Meditation Monastery in Huangmei District of the province of Qi, where the Fifth Patriarch of Chan lived and delivered his teachings. Huineng's customer paid his ten silver taels and suggested that he meet the Fifth Patriarch of Chan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Meeting the Fifth Patriarch of Chan Buddhism===
Huineng reached Huangmei thirty days later, and expressed to the Fifth Patriarch his specific request of attaining Buddhahood. Since Huineng came from Guangdong and was physically distinctive from the northern people from China, the Fifth Patriarch Hongren questioned his origin as a “barbarian from the south”, and doubted his ability to attain enlightenment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Huineng impressed Hongren with a clear understanding of the ubiquitous Buddha nature in everyone, and convinced Hongren to let him stay. He was told to split firewood and pound rice in the backyard of the monastery and avoid going to the main hall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==The Platform Sutra==
The [[Platform Sutra|Platform Sūtra of the Sixth Patriarch]]{{sfn|McRae|2000}} is attributed to a disciple of Huineng named Fahai (法海) and purports to be a record of Huineng's life, lectures and interactions with disciples. However, the text shows signs of having been constructed over a longer period of time, and contains different layers of writing.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} It is...
{{quote|...a wonderful melange of early Chan teachings, a virtual repository of the entire tradition up to the second half of the eighth century. At the heart of the sermon is the same understanding of the Buddha-nature that we have seen in texts attributed to Bodhidharma and Hongren, including the idea that the fundamental Buddha-nature is ''only'' made invisible to ordinary humans by their illusions.{{sfn|McRae|2003|p=65-66}}}}

==Succession of the Six Patriarch==
===Poem Contest===
Eight months later, the Fifth Patriarch summoned all his followers and proposed a poem contest for his followers to demonstrate the stage of their understanding of the essence of mind. He decided to pass down his robe and teachings to the winner of the contest, who would become the Sixth Patriarch.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Shenxiu, the leading disciple of the Fifth Patriarch, composed a stanza but did not have the courage to present it to the master. Instead, he wrote his stanza on the south corridor wall to remain anonymous one day at midnight. The other monks saw the stanza and commended it. Shenxiu's stanza is as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

''The body is the tree of enlightenment,   身是菩提樹，''

''The mind is like a bright mirror’s stand; 心如明鏡臺。''

''Time after time polish it diligently,          時時勤拂拭，''

''So that no dust can collect.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;                ''勿使惹塵埃。''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Patriarch was not satisfied with Shenxiu's stanza, and pointed out that the poem did not show understanding of “[his] own fundamental nature and essence of mind”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He gave Shenxiu a chance to submit another poem to demonstrate that he had entered the “gate of enlightenment”, so that he could transmit his robe and the Dharma to Shenxiu, but the student's mind was agitated and could not write one more stanza.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Two days later, the illiterate Huineng heard Shenxiu's stanza being chanted by a young attendant at the monastery and inquired about the context of the poem. The attendant explained to him the poem contest and the transmission of the robe and Dharma.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Huineng asked to be led to the corridor, where he could also pay homage to the stanza. He asked a low-ranking official named Zhang Riyong from Jiangzhou to read the verse to him, and then immediately asked him to write down a stanza that he composed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Huineng's stanza was the following:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
''Enlightenment is not a tree,                   菩提本無樹，''

''The bright mirror has no stand;              明鏡亦非臺。''

''Originally there is not one thing—          本來無一物，''

''What place could there be for dust?'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  何處惹塵埃。&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The followers who were present were astonished by the work of a southern barbarian. Being cautious of Huineng's status, the Patriarch wiped away the stanza and claimed that the author of the stanza had not reached enlightenment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
=== Succession of Sixth Patriarch ===
However, on the next day, the Patriarch secretly went to Huineng's room and asked, “Should not a seeker after the Dharma risk his life this way?” Then he asked, “is the rice ready?” Huineng responded that the rice was ready and only waiting to be sieved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Patriarch secretly explained the Diamond Sutra to Huineng, and when Huineng heard the phrase “one should activate one’s mind so it has no attachment”, he was “suddenly and completely enlightened, and understood that all things exist in self-nature.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   

The Dharma was passed to Huineng at night, when the Patriarch transmitted “the doctrine of sudden enlightenment” as well as his robe and bowl to Huineng. He told Huineng, “You are now the Sixth Patriarch. Take care of yourself, save as many sentient beings as you can, and spread the teachings so they will not be lost in the future.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

=== Escape from Monastery ===
He also explained to Huineng that the Dharma was transmitted from mind to mind, whereas the robe was passed down physically from one patriarch to the next. Hongren instructed the Sixth Patriarch to leave the monastery before he could be harmed. “You can stop at Huai and then hide yourself at Hui.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hongren showed Huineng the route to leave the monastery, and rowed Huineng across the river to assist his escape. Huineng immediately responded with a clear understanding of Hongren's purpose in doing so, and demonstrated that he could ferry to “the other shore” with the Dharma that had been transmitted to him.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

The Sixth Patriarch reached the Tayu Mountains within two months, and realized that hundreds of men were following him, attempting to rob him of the robe and bowl. However, the robe and bowl could not be moved by Huiming, who then asked for the transmission of Dharma from Huineng. Huineng helped him reach enlightenment and continued on his journey.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
=== Interpretation of the verses ===
According to the traditional interpretation, which is based on Guifeng Zongmi, the fifth-generation successor of Shenhui, the two verses represent respectively the gradual and the sudden approach. According to McRae, this is an incorrect understanding:

[T]he verse attributed to Shenxiu does not in fact refer to gradual or progressive endeavor, but to a constant practice of cleaning the mirror [...] [H]is basic message was that of the constant and perfect teaching, the endless personal manifestation of the bodhisattva ideal.

Huineng's verse does not stand alone, but forms a pair with Shenxiu's verse: Huineng's verse(s) apply the rhetoric of emptiness to undercut the substantiality of the terms of that formulation. However, the basic meaning of the first proposition still remains.

McRae notes a similarity in reasoning with the Oxhead School, which used a threefold structure of "absolute, relative and middle", or "thesis-antithesis-synthesis". According to McRae, the Platform Sutra itself is the synthesis in this threefold structure, giving a balance between the need of constant practice and the insight into the absolute.

==Teachings==
===Sudden Enlightenment===
Doctrinally the Southern School is associated with the teaching that [[subitism|enlightenment is sudden]], while the [[Northern School]] is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is gradual. This is a polemical exaggeration, since both schools were derived from the same tradition, and the so-called Southern School incorporated many teachings of the more influential Northern School.{{sfn|McRae|2003}} Eventually both schools died out, but the influence of Shenhui was so immense that all later Chan schools traced their origin to Huineng, and "sudden enlightenment" became a standard doctrine of Chan.{{sfn|McRae|2003}}

===No-thought and [[meditation]]===
According to tradition Huineng taught "no-thought", the "pure and unattached mind" which "comes and goes freely and functions fluently without any hindrance".{{sfn|Wu|2004|p=73}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/huineng/#SSH4aiii|title=iv. Sudden Awakening (dun wu)|website=Iep.utm.edu|accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The alleged Northern school's emphasis on quiet contemplation was criticised by Huineng:
&lt;poem&gt;:When alive, one keeps sitting without lying down.
:When dead, one lies without sitting up.
:In both cases, a set of stinking bones!
:What has it to do with the great lesson of life?{{sfn|Wu|2004|p=73}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|It's an irony that his body was mummified after his death, keeping sitting up. See also [http://mbingenheimer.net/publications/ritzinger-bingenheimer.buddhistMummies.pdf] Justin Ritzinger and Marcus Bingenheimer (2006), ''Whole-body relics in Chinese Buddhism – Previous Research and Historical Overview and [[Buddhist mummies]]''}}&lt;/poem&gt;

==Liang Kai's Portrayal of Huineng==
[[File:Huineng Cut Bamboo.jpg|thumb|Liang Kai, ''The Sixth Patriarch Cutting the Bamboo'', Song Dynasty (960–1279 AD), ink on paper, 72.7 x 31.5 cm, Tokyo National Museum, Japan|374x374px]]The two paintings to the right were both completed by [[Liang Kai]], a painter from Southern Song dynasty, who left his position as the court painter in Jia Tai's count to practice Chan. These paintings depict Huineng, the Sixth Patriarch of Chan Buddhism. The protagonist occupies the lower central portion of both paintings, with his face turned to the side, so that his facial features are not portrayed. 

The Sixth Patriarch Cutting the Bamboo depicts the process that Huineng went through to attain enlightenment and shows Huineng's concentration and contemplation while chopping bamboo. This particular enlightenment moment of his is only documented in this painting, not in any literary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ieas.berkeley.edu/publications/pdf/aparv_lecture11d.pdf|title=“Lecture Notes, by James Cahill”|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds an axe in his right hand, and extends his left arm to steady a stalk of bamboo while scrutinizing it. The brushstrokes are loose and free but construct a simplistic and lively image: they indicate a subtle motion of pulling the bamboo towards him. Huineng wears a shirt with sleeves rolled up, which is suggested by the crease at the edges of the shoulders. He puts his extra cloth into a hair bun. The light and dark ink indicate gradation and contrast, and the light shadow on his right arm and body of bamboo implies the source of light.

Similarly, The Sixth Patriarch Tearing a Sutra adopts a similar style in portraying the same figure, Huineng, performing a different mundane action. This reaffirms the focus of the Southern Chan Tradition, which is to attain sudden enlightenment without having to train to be a monk in the conventional way or to study Buddhist scriptures.

==Historical Impact==
According to modern historiography, Huineng was a marginal and obscure historical figure. 

Modern scholarship has questioned his [[hagiography]], with some researchers speculating that this story was created around the middle of the 8th century, beginning in 731 by [[Shenhui]], a successor to Huineng, to win influence at the Imperial Court. He claimed Huineng to be the successor to Hongren, instead of the then publicly recognized successor Shenxiu:{{sfn|Jorgesen|2005}}{{sfn|McRae|2003}} 
{{quote|It was through the propaganda of Shenhui (684-758) that Huineng (d. 710) became the also today still towering figure of sixth patriarch of Chan/Zen Buddhism, and accepted as the ancestor or founder of all subsequent Chan lineages ... using the life of Confucius as a template for its structure, Shenhui invented a hagiography for the then highly obscure Huineng. At the same time, Shenhui forged a lineage of patriarchs of Chan back to the Buddha using ideas from Indian Buddhism and Chinese ancestor worship.{{sfn|Jorgesen|2005}}|sign=|source=}}
[[File:The Sixth Patriarch Tearing a Sutra.jpg|thumb|371x371px|Liang Kai, ''The Sixth Patriarch Tearing a Sutra'', Song Dynasty (960–1279 AD), ink on paper, 72.9 x 31.6 cm, Mitsu Memorial Museum, Japan]]
In 745, Shenhui was invited to take up residence in the Heze temple in Luoyang. In 753, he fell out of grace, and had to leave the capital to go into exile. The most prominent of the successors of his lineage was [[Guifeng Zongmi]].{{sfn|Yampolski|2003-A|p=9}} According to Zongmi, Shenhui's approach was officially sanctioned in 796, when "an imperial commission determined that the Southern line of Ch'an represented the orthodox transmission and established Shen-hui as the seventh patriarch, placing an inscription to that effect in the Shen-lung temple".{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=279}}

==Mummification==
A mummified body, supposedly that of Huineng, is kept in [[Nanhua Temple]] in [[Shaoguan]] (northern [[Guangdong]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://zen.thetao.info/read/huineng.htm Images of Huineng's temple and Mummy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041012041508/http://zen.thetao.info/read/huineng.htm |date=2004-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This mummy was seen by the Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]] who visited Nanhua Temple in 1589. Ricci told the European readers the story of Huineng (in a somewhat edited form), describing him as akin to a Christian [[ascetic]]. Ricci names him ''Liùzǔ'' (i.e. 六祖, "The Sixth Ancestor").&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas]]'', Book Three, Chapter 1. Pages 222-224 in the English translation: Louis J. Gallagher (1953). "China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Matthew Ricci", Random House, New York, 1953.[https://books.google.com/books?id=iLsWAAAAQAAJ Latin original text: De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu]&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Nanhua Temple gate.JPG|thumb|389x389px|[[Nanhua Temple]] today, where Huineng is said to have lived and taught.|center]]

==Controversy==
The biography of Huineng explained in the Platform Sutra is a compelling legend of an illiterate, “barbarian” layman who became a Patriarch of Chan Buddhism. Most of what we know about Huineng comes from the Platform Sutra, which consists of the record of a public talk that includes an autobiography of Huineng, which was a hagiography, or “a biography of a saint portraying him as a hero”, and this pseudo-autobiography was written to give authority to the teachings of Huineng.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/787845142|title=Readings of the Platform sūtra|last=638-713.|first=Huineng,|date=2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|others=Schlütter, Morten., Teiser, Stephen F.|year=|isbn=9780231500555|location=New York|pages=133|oclc=787845142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sutra became a very popular text to be circulated around, attempting to increase the importance of this exclusive lineage of Huineng. As a history, the account might have been altered over the centuries. Shenhui (685-758) was the first person to claim that Huineng was a saint and hero. As a result of this contested claim, modifications were made to the Platform Sutra, a manuscript copy of which was later found at [[Dunhuang]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;   

It turns out that little was known about Huineng before Shenhui's account of him. “It took all the rhetorical skills of Shen-hui and his sympathisers to give a form to the name Huineng,” and hence the character Huineng described by Shenhui was not completely factual.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the Platform Sutra, following Huineng's sermon was a narrative by Fahai, who addressed a few interviews between Huineng and his disciples, including Shenhui. It is likely that “much of the Platform Sutra was built on the inventions of Shenhui”, and the textual evidence suggests that “the work was written soon after his death”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After Huineng's death, Shenhui wanted to claim his authority over Chan Buddhism, but his position was challenged by Shenxiu and Puji, who supported the Northern lineage that taught gradual enlightenment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is reasonable to assume that this autobiography was likely an attempt by Shenhui to relate himself to the most renowned figures in Zen Buddhism, which essentially enabled him to connect to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] through this lineage.   

An epitaph of Huineng, inscribed by the established poet Wang Wei also reveals inconsistencies with Shenhui's account of Huineng. The epitaph “does not attack Northern Chan, and adds new information on a monk, Yinzong (627-713), who is said to have tonsured Huineng”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Wang Wei was a poet and a government official, whereas Shenhui was a propagandist who preached to the crowd, which again leads to questions about his credibility.   

“As far as can be determined from surviving evidence, Shenhui possessed little or no reliable information on Huineng except that he was a disciple of Hongren, lived in Shaozhou, and was regarded by some Chan followers as a teacher of only regional importance”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It seems that Shenhui invented the figure of Huineng for himself to become the “true heir of the single line of transmission from the Buddha in the Southern lineage”, and this appears to be the only way he could have done so.   

On a related note, the Chan Buddhist practices, including the wordless transmission and sudden enlightenment were much different from the traditional training of a monk. “The Chan accounts ridicule every element of the scholar-monk ideal that had taken shape over the centuries in traditional hagiography”, with examples found in the immense literature of the “classical period”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36423410|title=The eminent monk : Buddhist ideals in medieval Chinese hagiography|last=1964-|first=Kieschnick, John,|date=1997|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|year=|isbn=0824818415|location=Honolulu|pages=133|oclc=36423410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irving Solomon "Irv" Teibel''' (October 9, 1938 - October 28, 2010) was an American [[field recording|field recordist]], graphic designer, and photographer. His company, Syntonic Research, Inc., is best known for its influential ''[[Environments (album series)|environments]]'' psychoacoustic recording series (1969-1979) and ''The Altered Nixon Speech'' (1973). Teibel was also an accomplished photographer who worked as an editor for [[Ziff Davis]] and photographed for ''[[Popular Photography]]'' and ''[[Car and Driver]]''.

==Biography and Work==
Teibel was born in Buffalo, New York in 1938.&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt; He attended the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] and the [[Art Center College of Design]] in Pasadena, California before serving in the army as a public information specialist in [[Stuttgart]], Germany. During this time he became interested in [[electronic music]] and [[musique concrète]] and began experimenting with tape at a local radio station.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Gerald|title=The World Is Alive With The Sound of Sounds|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C0DE0DB1038E53BBC4A53DFB566838E669EDE|accessdate=9 September 2014|agency=''The New York Times''|date=March 2, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Germany he also claimed to have studied briefly with [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]].{{cite interview|Teibel= |Irv= |subject-link=Irv Teibel|title=Interview with Irv Teibel|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izacImmVMqM&amp;t=40s|location=Austin|date= |access-date=April 28, 2017}}

Teibel returned from [[Europe]] in 1966 and settled in [[New York City]] where he worked a number of jobs including associate editor at [[Ziff Davis]]. He also took night classes in electronic music at [[The New School]] during this time and was a founding resident of the famous [[Westbeth Artists Community]]. In 1969, he worked with [[Tony Conrad]] on Conrad's film ''Coming Attractions'' which involved recording the ocean at [[Coney Island]]. After this experience, Teibel became interested in using natural white noise for psychological purposes. Working with neuropsychologist [[Louis Gerstman|Lou Gerstman]] at [[Bell Labs]], he processed a short ocean loop recorded at [[Brighton Beach]] through an [[IBM System/360|IBM 360]] computer to create one continuous thirty-minute [[soundscape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Teibel|first1=Irv|title=Mother Nature Goes Digital|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/deli/mother_nature.php|website=Atari Archives|accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became the first ''environments'' recording, "The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore." The record was unique for its [[Unusual types of gramophone records|extremely long playback]] times—30 minutes per side at 33{{1/3}}&amp;nbsp;rpm—and could be played at any speed from 16{{2/3}} up to 45&amp;nbsp;rpm. "The Psychologically Ultimate Seashore" was one of the first commercially available releases edited with a mainframe computer&lt;ref name="Sonic Technologies"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hagood|first1=Mack|title=Sonic Technologies of the Self: Mediating Sound, Space, and Sociality|url=http://www.mactrasound.com/home/cv|website=Mactrasound|publisher=Indiana University|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the earlier examples of commercial [[quadraphonic sound]].&lt;ref name="The Record"&gt;{{cite web|last1=LeBlanc|first1=Larry|title=Page Five with Larry LeBlanc|url=http://www.irvteibel.com/media/|website=The Record|publisher=David Farrell &amp; Associates Inc.|accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Teibel created an environmental sound installation for the [[Museum of Arts and Design|Museum of Contemporary Crafts]],&lt;ref name="16 Environments"&gt;{{cite news|title=16 Environments|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1299&amp;dat=19700122&amp;id=q1QQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=N4wDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4696,1182005|accessdate=9 September 2014|agency=''The Village Voice''|date=January 22, 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1971, he began teaching a class in experimental recording techniques at The New School.&lt;ref name="New School"&gt;{{cite web|title=New School Bulletin Fall 1972|url=http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/index.php/Detail/objects/NS050101_ns1972fa|website=The New School Digital Archives|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, to demonstrate how magnetic tape could be manipulated, Teibel edited [[Richard Nixon]]’s August 15th speech to reveal that the president, in fact, had “prior knowledge” of the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate break-in]]. In the subsequent years, Teibel performed as an expert witness for magnetic tape technology.

In 1981, Teibel moved to [[Austin, Texas]], with his then-wife Rosanne. They had two daughters, Jennifer and Dara. He lived in Austin for 29 years until his death on October 28, 2010 at age 72.&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite web|title=Irv Teibel Obituary|url=http://hosting-22183.tributes.com/show/Irv-Teibel-89693321|website=Weed-Corley-Fish Funeral Homes|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His brother Phil was a violinist with the [[Buffalo Philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philip J. Teibel, Violinist With Philharmonic|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-22876359.html|publisher=The Buffalo News|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

Over the years, Teibel's recordings attracted significant national and international attention from publications like ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt; Teibel claimed ''environments 6'' was excerpted in the “Sounds of Earth” audio collage aboard the [[Voyager program|Voyager Spacecraft]]’s [[Voyager Golden Record|Golden Record]] (this is still unverified).&lt;ref name="BBC Whale Music"&gt;{{cite web|title=More Than Just Whale Music|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01f1nf9|website=BBC Radio|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work also appears in [[Terrence Malick]]’s ''[[Days of Heaven]]'', credited as "special environmental sound recording,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syntonic Research, Inc.|url=https://www.imdb.com/company/co0247527/|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Errol Morris]]' ''[[Gates of Heaven]]'' as "environmental sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gates of Heaven Cast and Crew|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/19293/Gates-of-Heaven/credits|website=The New York Times|accessdate=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, his work appeared in Lise Raven's film ''Kinderwald''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harvey|first1=Dennis|title=Film Review: 'Kinderwald'|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-kinderwald-2-1201103028/|website=Variety|accessdate=9 September 2014|date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music critic [[Robert Christgau]] described [[Lou Reed]]'s ''[[Metal Machine Music]]'' as "Lou's answer to ''Environments''"&lt;ref name="Robert Christgau"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christgau|first1=Robert|title=Metal Machine Music|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Lou+Reed|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lester Bangs]] included ''environments 2'' on his list of the "Ten Most Ridiculous Records of the Seventies."&lt;ref name="Lester Bangs"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bangs|first1=Lester|title=The Ten Most Ridiculous Records of the Seventies|url=http://www.superseventies.com/ridiculousrecords.html|website=Super Seventies|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musicians [[Prurient|Dominick Fernow]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fernow|first1=Dominick|title=My Favorite Record: Dominick Fernow|url=http://www.factmag.com/2014/04/23/my-favourite-record-dominick-fernow/|website=FACT Magazine|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Micachu|Mica Levi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Lucy|title=Q&amp;A: Under The Skin Of Mica Levi's Masterful Film Score|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/qa-under-the-skin-of-mica-levis-masterful-film-score|website=NME|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also listed ''environments'' LPs of among their favorite recordings. ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'' magazine included ''environments 1'' on their list of "The Top 10 Field Recordings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Sean|title=Noise From the Field: The Top 10 Field Recordings|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/1930601/noise-field-top-10-field-recordings|accessdate=18 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album cover for the drone metal group [[Earth (American band)|Earth]]'s album ''[[Earth 2 (album)|Earth 2]]'' is an homage to the ''environments 2'' CD with its "special low frequency version" message.

''[[Atlas Obscura]]'' has described Teibel as "a forgotten 1970s-era hippie polymath."&lt;ref name="Atlas Obscura"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giaimo|first1=Cara|title=The Man Who Recorded, Tamed and Then Sold Nature Sounds to America|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-man-who-recorded-tamed-and-then-sold-nature-sounds-to-america|website=Atlas Obscura|accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They go on to explain his lasting influence: "If you flip on a waterfall to fall asleep, if you keep rainymood.com in your bookmarks, if you associate well-being with the sound of streams and crickets or wonder why the beach never quite sounds as tranquil as you imagine, it's because of Teibel."&lt;ref name="Atlas Obscura"/&gt;

''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' elaborates on the novelty of Teibel's work: "Now, Teibel’s concept—the soothing sounds of nature, or at least a synthesized facsimile of it—is quaint, the wallpaper of therapy waiting rooms and spa foyers. At the time, it was entirely new."&lt;ref name="Pitchfork"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Mike|title=Natural Selection: How a New Age Hustler Sold the Sound of the World|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/cover-story/reader/natural-selection|website=Pitchfork|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They go on to explain the complicated place Teibel's work inhabits in the history of field recording and music: "Here was nature not as it is, but as we hope it’ll be, the lullaby of waves without the sand in our trunks."&lt;ref name=Pitchfork /&gt;

In February 2018, the Chicago reissue label [[The Numero Group|Numero Group]] re-released Teibel's original recordings as an ambient sound app for iOS devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blais-Billie|first1=Braudie|title=Numero Group Launch New Ambient Sound App|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/numero-group-launch-new-ambient-sound-app/|website=Pitchfork|accessdate=9 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isidor Bush''' or Busch (January 15, 1822, [[Prague]] – August 5, 1898, [[St. Louis, Missouri]]) was a man of letters, publisher, and [[Viticulture|viticulturalist]]. 

His maternal great-grandfather was Israel Hönig, Edler von Hönigsberg, the first Jew raised to nobility in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;see Kompert, ''Oesterreichische Adelshalle für Israeliten''&lt;/ref&gt; 

=="Jahrbücher"==

When fifteen years of age, he entered Anton von Schmid's printing establishment in Vienna, which his father had acquired. The Talmud published with the imprint of Von Schmid and Bush was prized for some time afterwards for its exactness. For six years (1842–47) Bush edited and published the ''Kalender und Jahrbuch für Israeliten'' (Vienna). Its plan was the presentation in the same book of the productions of leading Jewish scholars of divergent views. Among these were Leopold Zunz, [[Samuel Judah Löb Rapoport|S. L. Rapoport]], [[Samuel David Luzzatto|S. D. Luzzatto]], [[Gotthold Salomon]], [[Ludwig Philippson]], Michael Sachs, [[Isaac Noah Mannheimer]], Joseph Wertheimer, Leopold Stern, [[Theodor Creizenach]], [[Ludwig August von Frankl]], [[Leopold Kompert]], [[Leopold Löw]], and Simon Szanto. Some of these made their first appearance as writers in the pages of the "Jahrbücher." In 1844 he edited ''Mesillat ha-Limmud'' (Way of Instruction), which was published by his father after Bush had left for America. Liberal in politics, he edited the ''Osterreichisches Zentral-Organ für Glaubensfreiheit'', and other revolutionary papers issued from his press.

==Career in the US==
When the [[Revolutions of 1848|Revolution of 1848]] failed he had to flee to [[New York City]], where he arrived Jan. 8, 1849. There Bush opened a store for the sale of newspapers and stationery, and, on March 30, 1849, published the initial number of ''Israel's Herald'', the first Jewish weekly in the United States, which, however, lived only three months. He was assisted in producing it by leading members of the Order [[B'nai B'rith]]. In the summer of 1849 Bush went to St. Louis, where he managed a general store for six years. In 1857 Bush was made president of the People's Savings Bank. When the [[Missouri Constitutional Convention (1861-63)|Missouri Convention]] was called to determine whether the state should join in the secession movement, Bush was chosen a member on the [[Unconditional Union Party|Unconditional Union]] ticket, and was made a member of the Committee of Nine, to which most important matters were referred.

When [[John C. Frémont|Fremont]] took command in 1861, with headquarters in St. Louis, Bush was made his [[aide-de-camp]], with the rank of captain. He submitted to [[Salmon P. Chase|Secretary of the Treasury Chase]] a plan for a government loan of one hundred million dollars, similar to the famous [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] premium loans of Austria. Mr. Chase feared its rejection by Congress, but was impressed with Bush's financial genius, and offered him a Treasury clerkship. Bush returned shortly afterward to St. Louis, and became for six years general freight and passenger agent of the [[St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway|St. Louis and Iron Mountain Railroad Company]]. 

He assisted in forming Congregation B'ne El in St. Louis along with [[Daniel Block]]&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Walter. Zion in the Valley. The Jewish Community of St. Louis. Volume 1. 1807-1907. University of Missouri Press. Columbia and London. 1997. {{ISBN|0-8262-1098-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in establishing the Independent Order B'nai B'rith in the West, and was henceforth prominently identified with the Order, rendering especially useful service in connection with its endowment or insurance feature, and in forming the Cleveland Jewish Orphan Asylum. His interest in the society led him to become an insurance actuary.

Bush was chosen member of the state convention called to abolish slavery and to form a new constitution. He was elected a member of the Missouri state board of immigration to repair losses in population resulting from the war, which post he retained for twelve years. Later in life Bush became interested in [[viticulture]]. He purchased a tract of land (named by him "Bushberg") outside the city, which became noted for its products; and he even sent large quantities of cuttings from his vineyards to France to replace ravages by [[phylloxera]]. Bush, after years of preparation, published a catalogue of grapes, ''The Bushberg Catalogue'', which has gone through several editions and has been translated into several languages.

Bush died in St. Louis in 1898 and was buried in [[Bellefontaine Cemetery]].

In Brazil, France, Romania, Italy, and others, Iglesias is the most successful foreign record seller, while in his home country, Spain, he has sold the most records in history, with 23 million records.

During his career, Iglesias has won many awards in the music industry, including the [[Grammy]], [[Latin Grammy]], [[World Music Award]], [[Billboard Music Award]], [[American Music Award]] and [[Lo Nuestro Awards|Lo Nuestro Award]].

==Early life==
Iglesias was born in [[Madrid]] to [[Julio Iglesias Sr.]], a [[medical doctor]] from [[Ourense]] who became one of the youngest [[gynecologist]]s in the country, and María del Rosario de la Cueva y Perignat. Iglesias's paternal ancestry comes from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Murashko|first=Alex|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/09/local/me-1436|title=Hands Across the Water, to Spain's Galicia|date=9 August 2000|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; his paternal grandparents were named Manuela Puga Noguerol  and Ulpiano Iglesias Sarria. His maternal grandparents were José de la Cueva y Orejuela (1887–1955),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Moral Roncal |first=Antonio M. |date=2003 |title=Cuba ante la Guerra Civil Española: la acción diplomática de Ramón Estalella |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ze2gAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Julio+Iglesias+Jose+de+la+Cueva+y+Orejuela&amp;dq=Julio+Iglesias+Jose+de+la+Cueva+y+Orejuela&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=U3yZUrZ4kNegBI-hgbAP&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA |publisher=Editorial Biblioteca Nueva, S.L. |isbn=8497421671 |accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Dolores de Perignat y Ruiz de Benavides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elcorreogallego.es/tendencias/ecg/vips-julio-cumple-67-anos-plena-gira-mundial/idEdicion-2010-10-02/idNoticia-595712/|title=Julio cumple 67 años en plena gira mundial|date=10 February 2010|publisher=elcorreogallegos.es|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was a native of [[Guayama, Puerto Rico|Guayama]], [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://peopleenespanol.com/article/julio-iglesias-tendra-una-estrella-en-el-paseo-de-la-fama-de-puerto-rico/|title=Julio Iglesias tendrá una estrella en el Paseo de la Fama de Puerto Rico|accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Iglesias" translates as "churches;" likewise, Iglesias is of [[Jew]]ish ancestry from his maternal side, having mentioned that his mother's family name, "de la Cueva y Perignat," meaning literally "of the cave," referring to Jewish people in hiding, is a very common Jewish name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB4D22FCBF3DE06&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=FRONT|date=12 July 1995|publisher=''[[The Miami Herald]]''|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brinn|first=David|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arts-and-Culture/Arts/Julio-Iglesias-still-speaks-the-language-of-love-331514|title=Julio Iglesias still speaks the language of love|date=12 November 2013|publisher=jpost.com|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He alternated playing professional football with studying law at the [[CEU San Pablo University]] in Madrid. In the earliest years of his young adulthood, he was a goalkeeper for [[Real Madrid Castilla]] in the [[Segunda División]]. His professional football career was ruined when he was involved in a serious automobile accident, due to which he was unable to walk for two years.&lt;ref name="ElSoldeCuervanaca"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldecuernavaca/notas/n1335699.htm|title=El personaje de hoy|date=23 September 2009|publisher=oem.com.mx|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he said of those years, "I had more courage and attitude than talent." These were sorely tested when he was involved in that car crash—it smashed his lower spine; his legs were permanently weakened as a direct result, and they still required therapy several years later. During his hospitalization after the accident, a nurse named Eladio Magdaleno gave him a guitar so that he could recover the dexterity of his hands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-4674151&lt;/ref&gt; In learning to play, he discovered his musical talent.&lt;ref name="People-1988"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dougherty|first1=Steve|last2=Gold|first2=Todd|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20099784,00.html

After that, he went back to obtain his law degree at [[Complutense University of Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20099784,00.html Julio Iglesias' Good Life Demands Wine, Women, Song—and More Women] - website People.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment career==
[[File:Julio Iglesias (Spanje), Bestanddeelnr 923-3697.jpg|thumb|250px|Julio Iglesias at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1970]].]]
In 1968, he won the [[Benidorm International Song Festival]], a songwriter's event in Spain, with the song ''"La vida sigue igual"'' (meaning "Life Goes On The Same") which was used in the film ''La vida sigue igual,'' about his own life. After this event he signed a deal with Discos Columbia, the Spanish branch of the [[Columbia Records]] company, and released his first studio album, titled ''Yo Canto,'' or ''I Sing.'' The
album spent 15 weeks in the Spanish charts,
and peaked at #3.&lt;ref name="Julio-Enrique" /&gt; He represented Spain in the 1970 [[Eurovision Song Contest 1970|Eurovision Song Contest]], finishing in fourth place&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=1393&amp;_t=iglesias_praises_eurovision_as_a_learning_moment|title=Iglesias praises Eurovision as a learning moment|date=11 October 2008|publisher=eurovision.tv|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; behind Ireland's winning entry, performed by [[Dana Rosemary Scallon|Dana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BgciAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GqYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7114,1414412&amp;dq=julio+iglesias+dana+rosemary+scallon+1970+eurovision+song+contest&amp;hl=en|title=Singer in Alabama eyes bid for the Irish presidency|date=8 August 1997|publisher=''[[The Tuscaloosa News]]''|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His entry was the song "[[Gwendolyne]]." Shortly after, he had a number one hit in many European countries with "Un Canto A Galicia," sung in [[Galician language|Galician]], in honour of his father, who hailed from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. That single sold 1 million copies in Germany. In 1975, he found success in the Italian market by recording a song exclusively in Italian, called "Se mi lasci non vale," or "If You Leave Me, It Can't Be." Notable albums from this decade are ''[[A flor de piel (album)|A flor de piel]]'' (1974, with the European hit "Manuela"), ''[[El amor (Julio Iglesias album)|El amor]]'' (1975), and ''[[Soy (Julio Iglesias album)|Soy]]'' (1973). He also sang in French; one of his popular songs in this language became "Je n'ai pas changé."

In 1979, he moved to [[Miami, Florida]], in the United States, signed a deal with [[CBS Corporation|CBS International]], and started singing in different languages such as English, French, Portuguese, German and other languages to his music. Two years later, in 1981, he released the album ''[[De niña a mujer]],'' which he dedicated to his daughter. (She shared the cover photo with him.) From it came the first English-language hit of his career, a Spanish cover of "[[Begin the Beguine]]" which became number 1 in the United Kingdom; he also released a collection, ''[[Julio (album)|Julio]]'' (1983). In 1984, he released ''[[1100 Bel Air Place]]'', the hit album which established him as a star in the English-speaking entertainment industry. It sold over three million albums in the United States alone.&lt;ref name="People-1988" /&gt; The first single, "[[To All the Girls I've Loved Before]]," a duet with [[Willie Nelson]], hit #1 on the Country charts and went Top Five in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Trust|first=Gary|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/471241/ask-billboard-readers-favorite-charted-odd-couples|title=Ask Billboard: Readers' Favorite Charted Odd Couples|date=20 May 2011|publisher=billboard.com|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also featured "[[All of You (Julio Iglesias and Diana Ross song)|All of You]]," in vocal duet with [[Diana Ross]], a Top Twenty Pop hit, that climbed to #2 on the Adult Contemporary Chart with the help of a popular video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com/mrrl-hall-of-fame/190-diana-ross|title=DIANA ROSS|publisher=michiganrockandrolllegends.com|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, he had recorded and released the previously mentioned duets with [[Diana Ross]] and [[Willie Nelson]]. Iglesias won a [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album]] in the [[Grammy Awards of 1988|1988 Grammy Awards]] for the album ''[[Un hombre solo]]'' ("A Man Alone"). He recorded a duet with [[Stevie Wonder]] on "My Love," in his ''[[Non Stop (Julio Iglesias album)|Non Stop]]'' album, a crossover success in 1988. In the 1990s Iglesias returned to his original Spanish melody in ''[[Tango (Julio Iglesias album)|Tango]]'' (1996), nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album|Best Latin Pop Album]] at the 1998 Grammy Awards, losing to the ''[[Romances (Luis Miguel album)|Romances]]'' album by Mexican singer, [[Luis Miguel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Latin Pop Performance" on Rockonthenet.com|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1998/grammys.htm|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iglesias made a cameo appearance as himself on ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' as [[Sophia Petrillo]]'s date on St. Valentine's Day 1989. In 2001, Iglesias was recognized as the [[Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year|Person of the Year]] by the [[Latin Recording Academy]].&lt;ref name="Iglesias"&gt;{{cite web|last=Susman|first=Gary|title=Model Patient|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,108354,00.html|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=November 8, 2010|date=May 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Iglesias was inducted into the [[International Latin Music Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International Latin Music Hall of Fame Announces Inductees for 2002|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/international-latin-music-hall-of-fame-announces-inductees-for-2002-76803217.html|accessdate=31 October 2015|date=5 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Julio released his album ''[[Divorcio]]'' ("Divorce"). In its first day of sales, ''Divorcio'' sold a record 350,000 albums in Spain, and reached the number 1 spot on the charts in Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, and Russia. In 2003 and 2004, aided by the success of his ''Divorcio'' album, Iglesias went on a ten-month world tour which took him from Europe to Asia and then on to North America, South America and Africa. More than half the shows on that tour sold out within days of going on sale. In December 2004, his Dutch girlfriend Miranda Rijnsburger and Iglesias himself recorded a duet of the Christmas song "[[Silent Night (song)|Silent Night]]". The song, which was not officially released, also included a voice message from Iglesias, Rijnsburger, and their 4 young children of that time. The song was released online through the singer's official website and a CD was included on their Christmas card as a holiday gift from the Iglesias family to their friends and fans around the world.

In 2008, Iglesias recorded another song as a gift to his fans. The family recorded "The Little Drummer Boy" in Spanish and English and included it in the family's Christmas card. Iglesias also made investments in the Dominican Republic's eastern town of [[Punta Cana]], a major tourist destination, where he took to spending most of the year. Indeed, Iglesias became a Dominican citizen in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.diariolibre.com/noticias/2009/10/21/i220301_julio-iglesias-dice-estar-enamorado-repablica-dominicana.html|title=Julio Iglesias dice estar "enamorado" de República Dominicana|date=21 October 2009|publisher=diariolibre.com|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, Iglesias released a new English-language album, which he titled ''[[Romantic Classics]].'' "I've chosen songs from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s that I believe will come to be regarded as the new standards," Iglesias stated in the album's sleeve notes. The album featured his interpretations of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]'s "I Want to Know What Love Is," the [[Wham!]] selection "Careless Whisper," and [[Richard Marx]]'s "Right Here Waiting." ''Romantic Classics'' was Iglesias's highest debut on the Billboard charts, entering at number 31 in the United States, 21 in Canada, 10 in Australia, and top spots across Europe and Asia. He returned to the studio to record songs in [[Philippine languages|Filipino]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] for his Asian releases of ''Romantic Classics'' which helped propel record sales in the Asian entertainment industry. Iglesias promoted ''Romantic Classics'' in 2006; it was seen all over the world on television shows. In the United States, for example, he appeared on ''[[Dancing With The Stars]],'' where he sang his version of "I Want To Know What Love Is," ''[[Good Morning America]]'', ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]],'' ''[[Fox and Friends]],'' and ''Martha Stewart.''

In 2008, Iglesias made a music video with [[Gulnara Karimova]], the daughter of Uzbek dictator [[Islam Karimov]].&lt;ref name="Pizano"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pizano|first=Pedro|title=Crooners and their Dictators|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pedro-pizano/crooners-and-their-dictators_b_1982520.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, the artist launched a new studio album called ''[[1 (Julio Iglesias album)|1]]'' (or ''[[1 (Julio Iglesias album)|Numero 1]]'').

Iglesias's performance of the song ''"[[La Mer (song)|La Mer]]"'' ("The Sea") is featured in the soundtrack of the 2011 film ''[[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy]].'' The performance comes from a live album, which had gone out of print by the last days of December 2015, that he recorded live at the [[Paris Olympia|Olympia]] theater in Paris in 1976. At the beginning and the end of the recording, Iglesias introduces the song, and his backing musicians, in fluent French.

In October 2012, Iglesias performed a concert in [[Equatorial Guinea]], where tickets were reportedly $1,000 each.&lt;ref name="Pizano"/&gt;

On 1 April 2013, in Beijing, he received two historic awards: '''First &amp; Most Popular International Artist of All Time in [[China]],''' an award given by Sony Music China and which was presented to Julio by the world-renowned Chinese artist [[Lang Lang]], and the [[Guinness World Records]] for the Best-selling Male Latin Artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2013/4/julio-iglesias-receives-world-record-certificate-in-beijing-47865/|title=Julio Iglesias receives world record certificat in Beijing|publisher=Guinness World Record|date=2 April 2013|accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Iglesias is a composer and lyricist, some of his songs{{Which|date=December 2015}} being of his own authorship and composition, on 23 April 2013, he was inducted into the [[Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame]], alongside [[Armando Manzanero]] and [[José Feliciano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gratereaux|first=Alexandra|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/entertainment/2013/04/24/latin-songwriters-hall-fame-opens-honoring-julio-iglesias-jose-feliciano/|title=

In 2015, as was announced,{{When|date=December 2015}} Iglesias was slated to perform a concert (complete show) for the first time with his son [[Julio Iglesias Jr.]] in a tour in Romania, on 22 May at [[Polyvalent Hall (Cluj-Napoca)|Sala Polivalentă]] in [[Cluj-Napoca]] and 2 July at [[Sala Palatului]] in the capital city, [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observator.tv/eveniment/julio-iglesias-i-julio-iglesias-jr-primul-concert-impreuna-152154.html|title=Julio Iglesias și Julio Iglesias Jr., primul concert împreună|publisher=Observator|date=14 May 2015|language=Romanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On 29 January 1971, Iglesias married [[Isabel Preysler]], a [[Philippines|Filipina]] journalist and [[television host]]. Preysler, a [[Filipino people of Spanish ancestry|Filipino of Spanish ancestry]], was also a member of the wealthy and aristocratic Perez de Tagle family. The couple had three children: [[Chabeli Iglesias|Chabeli]] (born 3 September 1971), a socialite; [[Julio Iglesias Jr.|Julio Jr.]] (born 25 February 1973), a singer; and [[Enrique Iglesias|Enrique]] (born 8 May 1975), an internationally successful singer-songwriter, actor, and record producer. In the 1970s, Iglesias and his family were extensively depicted on the front pages of international newspapers and magazines. The marriage of Iglesias and Preysler ended in divorce in 1979.

Whenever Iglesias was not on tour, he spent his time at his Miami residence, purchased in 1978 for $650,000. The mansion on the private [[Indian Creek, Florida|Indian Creek Island]], whose interior design was made by his true love [[Virginia Sipl]] "LA FLACA",  was placed on the market in 2006 for a quoted $28 million, making it one of "Ten Most Expensive Homes in the South" in 2006 according to ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/realestate/2006/06/09/expensive-homes-south_cx_lr_0612home.html | title=Home Improvements - Most Expensive Home In The U.S. 2006: South | publisher=www.forbes.com | author=Lacey Rose | accessdate=12 June 2006 | date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his divorce, Iglesias lived with Dutch model Miranda Rijnsburger (b. 1965), 22 years his junior, whom he married on 26 August 2010 in a small church in [[Marbella, Spain]]. They had five children: Miguel Alejandro Iglesias (born 7 September 1997), Rodrigo Iglesias (born 3 April 1999), twins Cristina and Victoria Iglesias (born 1 May 2001), and Guillermo Iglesias (born 5 May 2007). They took up residence in the Dominican Republic, where Iglesias had acquired several hotel complexes, as well as the [[Punta Cana International Airport]], which he acquired jointly with other investors, including fashion designer [[Oscar de la Renta]].&lt;ref name="ElSoldeCuervanaca" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanchez|first=Mamen|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20424857,00.html|title=Julio Iglesias &amp; Miranda Rijnsburger: Married After 20 Years!|date=20 September 2010|publisher=people.com|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 2005, Iglesias's father, Julio Iglesias Sr., died of a heart attack at the age of 90. A week before his death, it became known that the 42-year-old wife of Julio Iglesias Sr., Ronna Keith, was pregnant with their second child. Their first child, Jaime, was born on 18 May 2004. The second child, Ruth, was born on 26 July 2006.

In 2008, after his house in Indian Creek did not sell at his asking price, he ordered it razed and said he planned to build another on the lot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Christina S.

Real Music. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[German people|German]]-born [[New-age music|new-age]] and [[Ambient music|ambient]] musician. His music has strong [[Music of India|Indian]], [[Music of Africa|African]], [[Music of Australia|Australian]], [[Native American music|Native American]]/[[Aboriginal music of Canada]], and [[Middle Eastern music|Middle Eastern]] influences prevalent throughout with liberal use of Indian instruments such as the [[sitar]] along with [[violin]], [[didgeridoo]], [[bouzuki]], [[Native American flute]], [[Chinese flutes|Chinese temple flutes]], [[tambouras|tamboura]], [[bamboo musical instruments|bamboo flute]], and various world [[percussion instrument]]s.

Karunesh was born in [[Cologne]], Germany in 1956.&lt;ref name=RealMusic/&gt; Although he had been drawn to music as a child and played in bands as a teenager, he chose to study [[graphic design]] as a career. However, after obtaining his degree, Karunesh was involved in a serious [[motorcycle]] accident. His brush with death prompted him to choose music as a career instead of graphic design. He rethought his life and traveled to [[India]] in 1979, where he met [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Osho]] in his [[ashram]] in [[Pune]]. He became initiated and took on a new spiritual name, Karunesh (meaning "compassion" in [[Sanskrit]]).&lt;ref name=RealMusic/&gt;

Back in Germany, Karunesh lived in the [[Rajneesh]] commune of [[Hamburg]] for five years. There he came in contact with musicians from all over the world and developed an eclectic style of music.

In 1984, Karunesh released his first album, entitled ''Sounds of the Heart''.&lt;ref name=RealMusic/&gt; His next albums were ''Colors Of Light'' (1987) and ''Sky's Beyond'' (1989). His additional albums include ''Heart Chakra Meditation'' (1992), ''Secrets of Life'' (1996), and Zen Breakfast (2001).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pandora.com/karunesh?bio Pandora bio]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Knut Alvsson'''  (1455 &amp;ndash; 18 August 1502) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] nobleman and landowner. He was the country's foremost Norwegian-born noble in his time and served as fief-holder in southern-central Norway.&lt;ref name=SNL-A&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Knut Alvsson|encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|last=Mardal|first=Magnus A.|editor=Henriksen, Petter|year=2009|url=http://www.snl.no/Knut_Alvsson|language=Norwegian|accessdate=24 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was heir of the [[Sudreim claim]] to the [[Norwegian throne]] in accordance with the [[order of succession]] agreed to by Norwegian nobility and religious leadership when the [[Sverre dynasty]] became extinct. From 1497 to 1499 he served as commander of [[Akershus Fortress]] but was removed in 1499 when he lost [[Hans of Denmark|King Hans']] confidence.  In 1501 he led a rebellion against King Hans in Norway. He met his death at the hands of pro-Danish [[Henrich Krummedige]]’s men in spite of a promise of [[safe conduct]], effectively weakening the rebellion severely as well as ending a feud which had started with their fathers, [[Hartvig Krummedige]] and [[Alv Knutsson]].&lt;ref name=SNL-A/&gt;

==Background==
Knut Alvsson was the son of Norwegian National Council member [[Alv Knutsson]] and his wife [[Magnhild Oddsdotter]] (ca. 1425–1499).  He was the brother of 
[[Odd Alvsson]] (1460–1497), who was chief of [[Akershus fortress]], and half-brother of Karl Sigurdsson (1476–1487), who served as Bishop of the [[Ancient Diocese of Hamar|Diocese of Hamar]]. He was descended on his paternal grandfather’s side from the influential and wealthy Swedish [[Roos af Hjelmsäter|''Tre Rosor'']] noble family, which were active during the period of the [[Kalmar Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   https://nbl.snl.no/Magnhild_Oddsdatter|title=  Magnhild Oddsdatter|publisher = Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=   Per-Øivind Sandberg|accessdate= 1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://nbl.snl.no/Odd_Alvsson|title=  Odd Alvsson.

[[Image:Akershus festning.jpg|thumb|right|Knut Alvsson commanded Akershus Fortress]]

==Properties==
He inherited the [[Giske]] and Sudreim properties from his father, one of the largest estate owners in Norway, as well as goods and property in [[Romerike]] from his brother Odd Alvsson,  who died in 1497. He also held extensive properties in Sweden through his first marriage to the Swedish noblewoman Gyrvel Gyllenstjerna.&lt;ref name=SNL-A/&gt; Alvsson's property would be later forfeit to the crown. His estate in large part would subsequently be awarded to his granddaughter, [[Görvel Fadersdotter (Sparre)|Görvel Fadersdotter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/Knut_Alvsson|title= Knut Alvsson	|publisher = Store norske leksikon |author=   Erik Opsahl|accessdate= 1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   https://snl.no/G%C3%B6rvel_Fadersdotter|title= Görvel Fadersdotter|publisher =Store norske leksikon|author=   Erik Opsahl|accessdate= 1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   https://nbl.snl.no/G%C3%B8rvel_Fadersdatter|title= Gørvel Fadersdatter|publisher =     Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=  Per-Øivind Sandberg|accessdate= 1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alvson-Krummedige feud==
Knut Alvsson inherited a long-standing feud with members of the family of [[Henrich Krummedige]].  As a member of the pro-Swedish faction on the [[Rigsraadet|Norwegian council of the realm]], Alvsson was in natural opposition to Krummedige, who was a key member of the pro-Danish faction.&lt;ref name=stagg-84&gt;{{cite book|author=Stagg, Frank Noel |title=East Norway and its Frontier |publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin, Ltd. |year=1956 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oa8bAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=East+Norway+and+its+frontier+By+Frank+Noel+Stagg&amp;dq=East+Norway+and+its+frontier+By+Frank+Noel+Stagg&amp;pgis=1|pages=84–86 |accessdate=19 April 2009|ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1497 Alvsson's sheriff to Romerike, Lasse Skjold, was killed by the people of the district.  Alvsson received an open letter about the incident, which proclaimed that common people in the [[Nes, Akershus|Nes]] and [[Ullensaker]] stood together in the action in protest of his oppressive tax collection practices.&lt;ref name=stagg-84/&gt;

Alvsson discussed the rebellion of his people with the Danish and Norwegian councils of the realm, and following their recommendation, asked the offenders to apply for amnesty but they held him responsible for his sheriff’s actions. The farmers chose to exercise their ancient right to summon a [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] at [[Aker, Norway|Aker]] to submit their grievances and hear their defense for what they believed was a justified killing. They also intended to summon Alvsson to the thing.&lt;ref name=nbl-K&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Henrik Krummedike|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|last=Benedictow|first=Ole Jørgen|authorlink=Ole Jørgen Benedictow|year=2007|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/Henrik_Krummedike/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=17 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dbl-K&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last=Bricka |first= Carl Frederik  |title=Henrich Krummedige|encyclopedia=[[Dansk biografisk leksikon]] |year=1887–1905 | volume= 7 |url=http://runeberg.org/dbl/9/0551.html|language=Danish |accessdate=18 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These actions, combined with signs that the rebellion was spreading throughout the ''sønnafjells'' (the region of Norway south of the [[Dovrefjell|Dovre mountains]]). Alvsson was unable to quell the farmers' rebellion. The rebellion grew such that he was forced to request assistance from the commander of the Norwegian [[Bohus Fortress|Båhus fortress]], his rival and enemy, Henrich Krummedige, since the latter had demonstrated his ability to work constructively with his local land owners. Krummedige not only failed to support Alvsson, but informed the king of the matter. Alvsonn was relieved of his command of [[Akershus Fortress]] and replaced by [[Peder Griis]], a Danish nobleman loyal to the king.&lt;ref name=Gjerset-83&gt;{{cite book|author=Gjerset, Knut |title=History of the Norwegian People Volume II |publisher=The MacMillan Company |year=1915 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwJpAAAAMAAJ |pages=83–84  |accessdate=18 April 2009 |ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebellion==
In 1500 [[Hans of Denmark|King Hans of Denmark, Sweden and Norway]] made an ill-fated attempt to conquer the [[Dithmarschen|Ditmarshes]] in Northern Germany. Alvsson, who had married the granddaughter of Swedish King [[Charles VIII of Sweden|Karl Knutsson]], and was involved with the Swedish Independence Party, concluded it was time to act. While in Sweden he participated in the Swedish National Council meeting in [[Vadstena Castle]] in 1501, at which the council approved the revolt against King Hans]. Alvsson directed harsh accusations against King Hans' control in Norway and was provided Swedish support for his return to Norway, based on the belief that a Norwegian uprising would quickly follow the Swedish uprising.&lt;ref name=SNL-A/&gt; In 1501 he led Swedish forces in an attack on Båhus Fortress on the Swedish-Norwegian border, which Henrich Krummedige still commanded. Krummedige was able to hold his fief of Båhus, but Alvsson captured Akershus Fortress in March 1502, although the citizens of [[Oslo]] remained pro-Danish while the nobles and bishops of the country remained neutral{{snd}}presumably waiting to see which side prevailed.&lt;ref name=stagg-84/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gjerset-83/&gt;

King Hans dispatched his son Christian (later crowned King [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II of Denmark and Norway]]) at the head of Danish forces; they relieved the siege of Båhus Fortress, and also captured [[Älvsborg Fortress]] across the river from Båhus Fortress in [[Gothenburg]]. Krummedige then led forces north to finish off the rebellion by recapturing [[Tønsberg Fortress]] and investing Akershus Fortress, which Alvsson was defending.&lt;ref name=stagg-84/&gt;

When it became clear that the rebellion was stalemated, Alvsson came on board one of Krummedige's ships under a safe conduct. Krummedige's men killed Alvsson on 18 August 1502, either by treachery or, as alleged by Krummedige's men, in response to Alvsson's own violence. Breaking the rules of safe conduct was considered a grave treachery after the old Norse laws, which were still used in Norway at the time. However, the court in Oslo deemed Krummedige to have acted justly. The conditions for this judgement have been discussed by historians for years.&lt;ref name=stagg-84/&gt;

The crown judged Alvsson a traitor.  Krummedige had prevailed, although Gjerset reports he was compelled to leave Norway and the uprising was not totally quelled until December 1504. Alvsson's death at the hand of Krummedige’s minions caused the rebellion against the king to collapse. It also solidified the [[Danish-Norwegian]] ties and marked the last attempt at Norwegian independence for over 300 years.&lt;ref name=stagg-84/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gjerset-83/&gt;

==In literature==
The death of Alvsson has been romanticized to serve as a centerpiece for Norwegian [[Romantic Nationalism]]. Ibsen characterized the period of the [[Kalmar Union|Scandinavian Union]] and the subsequent Dano-Norwegian union (1537&amp;mdash;1814){{snd}}as "Four Hundred Years of Darkness" as part of the Norwegian nationalistic romantic literature upwelling in the close of the 18th century. For example, it was used to set an anti-Danish tone in Ibsen's play [[Lady Inger of Oestraat|''Fru Inger til Østeraad'']], when he has Olaf Skaktavl acclaim: "Recall the afternoon when Hendrik Krummedike came before Akershus fortress with his fleet? The captains of the fleet offered to discuss peace terms; and, trusting a safe conduct, Knut Alfsøn went onboard. Only three hours later we had to carry him through the fortress gate ... Norway's bravest heart was lost when Krummedike's minions struck him down..."&lt;ref name=Archer&gt;{{cite book|author= Archer, William (preface)| title=The Collected Works of Henrik Ibsen, Volume I &amp;mdash; Introduction to '"Lady Inger of Østråt" |publisher= Charles Scribner's Sons |year=1913|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nXtcAAAAMAAJ |accessdate= 22 April 2009 |pages= 22–23 |ISBN=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Ibsen | first = Henrik | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Fru Inger til Østråt| work = Henrik Ibsens samlede værker; Første bind   | publisher = [[Project Runeberg]] | date = | url =http://runeberg.org/ibsen/1/0272.html | format =Norwegian | doi = |page =272 | accessdate = 22 April 2009}}.

[[File:Wapistan.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Lawrence Martin aka Wapistan playing [[guitar]] and singing on board of [[Polar Bear Express]].]]

'''Lawrence Martin''' (born January 1956 in [[Moose Factory|Moose Factory, Ontario]])&lt;ref name=following&gt;"Following their heart home: The creative journey for Indian artists has many beginnings but a common path". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', 11 May 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; is a Canadian musician and politician. He has used the name '''Wapistan''', derived from the [[Cree language]] word for the [[marten]],&lt;ref name=following/&gt; in his musical work.

==Background==
A member of the [[Moose Cree First Nation]],&lt;ref name=wawatay&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.wawataynews.ca/node/109 | publisher=''[[Wawatay Native Communications Society|Wawatay News]]'' | accessdate=2007-11-06 | date=14 December 2006 | title=Lawrence Martin hosts music awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; he grew up in a small community called Moose River Crossing. As in the [[Cree]] traditional communities, the whole hamlet became his family. One of his aunts, Abba, recognized his talent for [[music]] at an early age. She bought him an acoustic guitar and taught him to play. Once he learned how to strum three chords, he began to write songs. He was around twelve years old at that time. From the age of fourteen, he attended secondary school in [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]]. 

In the 1980s, Martin was executive director of the [[Wawatay Native Communications Society]], a First Nations broadcaster in Northern Ontario.&lt;ref name=following/&gt; In this role, in 1989 he produced the first-ever television broadcast of a First Nations [[pow-wow]].&lt;ref name=following/&gt;

==Politics==
He became mayor of [[Sioux Lookout, Ontario|Sioux Lookout]] in 1991,&lt;ref&gt;"Incumbents win 131 of 225 mayoral races in province". ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'', 14 November 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal person]] in the province ever elected to the mayoralty of a municipality that was not a [[Indian reserve|First Nations reserve]].&lt;ref name=spirit&gt;"Politics of the spirit". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', 12 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He served in that position until 1994, and then took a job with the [[Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service]].&lt;ref name=birchbark&gt;[http://www.ammsa.com/publications/ontario-birchbark/martin-balances-politics-music-family-and-tradition "Martin balances politics, music, family and tradition"]. ''Ontario Birchbark'', Vol. 5, No. 10 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, he was elected to his first term as grand chief of the [[Mushkegowuk Council]],&lt;ref name=birchbark/&gt; serving until 2001.&lt;ref name=birchbark/&gt; During this time he ran as a candidate for the leadership of the [[Assembly of First Nations]] in its 2000 [[Assembly of First Nations leadership elections|leadership election]], but was not elected.&lt;ref&gt;"AFN leader makes pitch to keep his job". ''[[Sudbury Star]]'', 12 July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

He later moved to [[Cochrane, Ontario|Cochrane]], becoming executive director of the local [[Native Friendship Centre]].&lt;ref name=newcomer&gt;"Newcomer takes top job in Cochrane". ''[[Sudbury Star]]'', 11 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected mayor of that town in 2003,&lt;ref name=newcomer/&gt; becoming one of the few Canadian politicians ever to have held the mayoralty of two different municipalities. He served as mayor of Cochrane until 2010.

He was elected to a second term as grand chief of the Mushkegowuk Council in 2014, in a by-election following the death of incumbent chief Stan Louttit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/lawrence-martin-elected-mushkegowuk-grand-chief-1.2837548 "Lawrence Martin elected Mushkegowuk Grand Chief"]. [[CBC News]], 17 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==
At the [[Juno Awards of 1994]], he became the first winner of the [[Juno Award for Aboriginal Recording of the Year|Juno Award for Best Music of Aboriginal Canada Recording]] for his album ''Wapistan Is Lawrence Martin''.&lt;ref name=following/&gt; He was nominated two more times in the same category, at the [[Juno Awards of 1996]] for his album ''Message''&lt;ref&gt;"Complete list of 1996 Juno Award nominees". ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'', 3 June 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Juno Awards of 2003]] for ''The Right Combination'', an album he recorded as a duo with [[Vern Cheechoo]].&lt;ref&gt;"Knight, Cheechoo nominated for Juno". ''[[Saskatoon Star-Phoenix]]'', 14 February 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin and [[Andrea Menard]] cohosted the Canadian Aboriginal Music Awards in 2006.&lt;ref name=wawatay /&gt;

His song "I Got My Music" is featured on the 2014 compilation album ''[[Native North America, Vol. 1]]''.&lt;ref name=exclaim&gt;[http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/light_in_attic_sets_out_to_unearth_forgotten_history_of_first_nations_music_with_native_north_america_compilation "Light in the Attic Unearths the Forgotten History of First Nations Music with 'Native North America' Compilation"].

'''Mustapha Stambouli''' (March 10, 1920 in [[Mascara]], [[Algeria]] – April 20, 1984 in Mascara, Algeria) was an Algerian [[nationalist]] leader.

A [[law]] student, he was active for the nationalist cause from the late 1930s in the [[Parti du peuple algérien]] (PPA), and was jailed several times by the [[colonialism|colonial]] authorities of [[France]]. In 1948, he was arrested on the [[Libya]]n border, as he tried to join [[Arab]] [[guerrilla]]s in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. He joined the [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|Front de libération nationale]] (FLN), and served as an officer in its armed wing, the [[Armée de libération nationale]] (ALN), during the Algerian [[Algerian War of Independence|War of Independence]] (1954–62). He eventually became a secretary of state in the [[Gouvernement provisoire de la republique algérienne]] (GPRA), an [[exile government]] set up by the FLN. Following independence in 1962, he was elected to the constituent assembly, but played no major political role after that.

There is now a [[university]] named after him in his hometown of Mascara, Algeria.

'''Naram-Sin''' (also transcribed '''Narām-Sîn''' or '''Naram-Suen''', meaning "Beloved of [[Suen|Sin]]"; reigned c. 2254–2218 BC,&lt;ref&gt;[[middle chronology]]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a ruler of the [[Akkadian Empire]], the third successor and grandson of King [[Sargon of Akkad]]. Under Naram-Sin the empire reached its maximum strength. He was the first Mesopotamian king known to have claimed divinity for himself, taking the title "God of Akkad", and one of the first (following the earlier [[Lugal-Anne-Mundu]]) to claim the title "King of the Four Quarters, King of the Universe". &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

== Biography ==
Naram-Sin was born as a son of [[Manishtushu]]. He was thus a nephew of King [[Rimush]] and grandson of Sargon and [[Tashlultum]]. Naram-Sin's aunt was the High Priestess [[En-hedu-ana]].

===Reign===
[[File:Naram-Sin Rock Relief at Darband-i-Gawr, Qaradagh Mountain, Sulaymaniyah. Iraq.jpg|thumb|Naram-Sin Rock Relief at Darband-i-Gawr, Qaradagh Mountain, [[Sulaymaniyah]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan]]]]

Naram-Sin defeated Manium of Magan, and various northern hill tribes in the [[Zagros Mountains|Zagros]], [[Taurus Mountains|Taurus]], and [[Nur Mountains|Amanus Mountains]], expanding his empire up to the Mediterranean Sea and Armenia. His "Victory Stele" depicts his triumph over Satuni, chief of [[Lullubi]] in the [[Zagros Mountains]]. The king list gives the length of his reign as 56 years, and at least 20 of his year-names are known, referring to military actions against various places such as [[Uruk]] and [[Subartu]]. One unknown year was recorded as "the Year when Naram-Sin was victorious against Simurrum in Kirasheniwe and took prisoner Baba the governor of Simurrum, and Dubul the ''ensi'' of Arame".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdli.ucla.edu/tools/yearnames/HTML/T2K3.htm Year-Names of Naram-Sin of Agade]&lt;/ref&gt; Other year names refer to his construction work on temples in [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]], Nippur, and [[Zabala (Sumer)|Zabala]]. He also built administrative centers at [[Nagar, Syria|Nagar]] and [[Nineveh]]. At one point in his reign much of the empire, led by Iphur-Kis from the city of [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] rose in rebellion and was put down strongly. &lt;ref&gt; Steve Tinney, A New Look at Naram-Sin and the "Great Rebellion",  Journal of Cuneiform Studies, vol. 47, pp. 1-14, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Curse of Akkad===
One Mesopotamian myth, a historiographic poem entitled "The curse of Akkad: the Ekur avenged", explains how the empire created by [[Sargon of Akkad]] fell and the city of Akkad was destroyed. The myth was written hundreds of years after Naram-Sin's life and is the poet's attempt to explain how the Gutians succeeded in conquering Sumer. After an opening passage describing the glory of Akkad before its destruction, the poem tells of how Naram-Sin angered the chief god [[Enlil]] by plundering the [[Ekur]] (Enlil's temple in [[Nippur]].) In his rage, Enlil summoned the [[Gutian people|Gutians]] down from the hills east of the Tigris, bringing plague, famine and death throughout Mesopotamia. Food prices became vastly inflated, with the poem stating that 1 lamb would buy only half a ''sila'' (about 425 ml) of grain, half a ''sila'' of oil, or half a ''mina'' (about 250g) of wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Book |title=The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character |author=Samuel Noah Kramer |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iY9xp4pLp88C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+sumerians+Samuel+Noah+Kramer#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20sumerians%20Samuel%20Noah%20Kramer&amp;f=false |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |isbn=0 226 45238 7|date=2010-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent this destruction, eight of the gods (namely [[Inanna]], [[Enki]], [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], [[Ninurta]], [[Utu]], [[Adad|Ishkur]], [[Nusku]], and [[Nidaba]]) decreed that the city of Akkad should be destroyed in order to spare the rest of Sumer and cursed it. This is exactly what happens, and the story ends with the poet writing of Akkad's fate, mirroring the words of the gods' curse earlier on: 

"Its canalboat towpaths grew nothing but weeds,&lt;br&gt;
Its chariot roads grew nothing but the 'wailing plant,'&lt;br&gt;
Moreover, on its canalboat towpaths and landings,&lt;br&gt;
No human being walks because of the wild goats, vermin, snakes, and mountain scorpions,&lt;br&gt;
The plains where grew the heart-soothing plants, grew nothing but the 'reed of tears,'&lt;br&gt;
Akkad, instead of its sweet-flowing water, there flowed bitter water,&lt;br&gt;
Who said "I would dwell in that city" found not a good dwelling place,&lt;br&gt;
Who said "I would lie down in Akkad" found not a good sleeping place."

===Gutian Incursions===
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage=[[File:Victory stele of Naram Sin 9068.jpg|210px]] |video1 = [http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/victory-stele-of-naram-sin.html Victory Stele of Naram-Sin], [[Smarthistory]] }}
These Gutian raids were indeed devastating, but it is unknown how badly they affected Sumer. Naram-Sin may have passed on his empire to his son [[Shar-Kali-Sharri]] more or less intact upon his death in c. 2219 BC, or he may have passed on little more than Akkad itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Book |title=The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character |author=Samuel Noah Kramer |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iY9xp4pLp88C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+sumerians+Samuel+Noah+Kramer#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20sumerians%20Samuel%20Noah%20Kramer&amp;f=false |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |isbn=0 226 45238 7|date=2010-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However it is clear that soon after the death of Naram-Sin, the Akkadian Empire came under increasing pressure from the more and more frequent [[Gutian people|Gutian]] incursions, to the point that by c. 2100 BC, it seems that all of [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] except the city itself was in the hands of the Gutians. The Gutians remained there for over 100 years before being replaced by the [[Third Dynasty of Ur|Ur III state]] as the dominant political power.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Life and History, by E. A.

===Victory stele===
[[File:Victory stele of Naram Sin 9051.jpg|thumb|200px|Smaller fragment of [[Victory Stele of Naram-Sin]].]]
Naram-Sin's  [[Victory Stele of Naram-Sin|Victory Stele]] depicts him as a god-king (symbolized by his horned helmet) climbing a mountain above his soldiers, and his enemies, the defeated [[Lullubi]]. Although the stele was broken off at the top when it was stolen and carried off by the [[Elam]]ite forces of [[Shutruk-Nakhunte]], it still strikingly reveals the pride, glory, and divinity of Naram-Sin. The stele seems to break from tradition by using successive diagonal tiers to communicate the story to viewers, however the more traditional horizontal frames are visible on smaller broken pieces. It is six feet and seven inches tall, and made from pink [[limestone]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-534-64095-8"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kleiner, Fred |title=Gardner's Art Through The Ages |publisher=Thomson-Wadsworth |location= |year=2005 |isbn=0-534-64095-8 |oclc= |doi= |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stele was found at [[Susa]], and is now in the [[Louvre Museum]].&lt;ref name="isbn3-8331-1943-8"&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=Louvre ( Arts and Architecture) |publisher=Könemann |location=Köln |year= |pages= |isbn=3-8331-1943-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar ''bas-relief'' depicting Naram-Sin was found a few miles north-east of [[Diarbekr]], at Pir Hüseyin.

=== Children ===
Among the known sons of Naram-Sin were his successor [[Shar-Kali-Sharri]], Nabi-Ulmash, who
was governor of [[Tutub]], and a Ukin-Ulmash. Excavations at [[Urkesh|Tell Mozan]] (ancient Urkesh) brought to light a sealing of Tar'am-Agade, a previously unknown daughter of Naram-Sin, who was possibly married to an unidentified ''endan'' (ruler) of Urkesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buccellati|first1=Giorgio|last2=Kelly-Buccellati|first2=Marilyn|editor1-first=Lamia|editor1-last=Al-Gailani Werr|title=Of Pots and Plans.

[[File:Busbecq.jpg|thumb|right|150px| Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, 1557, 12.3 × 8.8 cm by [[Melchior Lorck]]]]

'''Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq''' (1522 in [[Comines, Nord|Comines]] &amp;ndash; 28 October 1592; [[Latin]]: '''Augerius Gislenius Busbequius'''; sometimes '''Augier Ghislain de Busbecq''') was a 16th-century [[County of Flanders|Flemish]] writer, [[Herbalism|herbalist]] and diplomat in the employ of three generations of [[List of rulers of Austria|Austrian monarchs]]. He served as ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[Constantinople]] and in 1581 published a book about his time there, ''Itinera Constantinopolitanum et Amasianum'', re-published in 1595 under the title of ''Turcicae epistolae'' or "Turkish Letters".

==Early years==
He was born the illegitimate son of the ''[[Lord|Seigneur]] de Busbecq'', Georges Ghiselin, and his mistress Catherine Hespiel, although he was later legitimated.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;Busbecq, Augier Ghislain de. (2009). In ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved August 28, 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9018254&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up at Busbecq Castle (in present-day [[Bousbecque]], [[Nord (département)|Nord]], [[France]]), studying in [[Wervik]] and Comines - at the time, all part of [[Spain|Spanish]] [[West Flanders]], a province of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

Busbecq's intellectual gifts led him to advanced studies at the Latin-language [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]], where he registered in 1536 under the name ''Ogier Ghislain de Comines''. From there, he went on to study at a number of well-known universities in northern [[Italy]], including taking classes from {{ill|Giovanni Battista Egnazio|it|Egnazio}} in [[Venice]].

Like his father and grandfather, Busbecq chose a career of public service. He started work in the court of the Austrian monarch [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in approximately 1552. In 1554, he was sent to [[England]] for the marriage in [[Winchester]] of the English queen [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]] to [[Philip II of Spain]].

==At the Ottoman court==
In 1554 and again in 1556,&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; Ferdinand named him ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]] under the rule of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. His task for much of the time he was in [[Constantinople]] was the negotiation of a border treaty between his employer (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) and the [[Sultan]] over the disputed territory of [[Transylvania]]. He had no success in this mission while [[Rustem Pasha]] was the Sultan's [[vizier]], but ultimately reached an accord with his successor [[Semiz Ali Pasha]].

[[File:Turkish letters-cover.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Cover page of ''Turcicae epistolae'', 1595 ed.]]During his stay in Constantinople, he wrote his best known work, the ''Turkish Letters'', a compendium of personal correspondence to his friend, and fellow [[Hungary|Hungarian]] diplomat, [[Nicholas Michault]], in [[Flanders]] and some of the world's first [[travel literature]]. These letters describe his adventures in Ottoman politics and remain one of the principal [[primary source]]s for students of the 16th-century Ottoman court. He also wrote in enormous detail about the plant and animal life he encountered in Turkey. His letters also contain the only surviving word list of [[Crimean Gothic]], a Germanic dialect spoken at the time in some isolated regions of [[Crimea]].&lt;ref name=dicts&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Cambridge University Press | isbn = 9780521886741 | pages = 139–140 | last = Considine | first = John | title = Dictionaries in early modern Europe

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Busbecq discovered an almost complete copy of the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', an account of Roman emperor [[Augustus]]' life and accomplishments, at the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]] in [[Ancyra]]. He identified its origin from his reading of [[Suetonius]] and published a copy of parts of it in his Turkish Letters.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Seymour Forster, translator, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=AnynLQ_cgjYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Turkish+Letters+of+Ogier+de+Busbecq&amp;ei=Fxt8S--AF5P8M6nGubsH&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Turkish Letters of Ogier de Busbecq]'' reprinted Louisiana State University 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an avid collector, acquiring valuable manuscripts, rare coins and curios of various kinds. Among the best known of his discoveries was a 6th-century copy of [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]]' ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'', a compendium of medicinal herbs. The emperor purchased it after Busbecq's recommendation; the manuscript is now known as the [[Vienna Dioscorides]]. His passion for herbalism led him to send Turkish [[tulip]] bulbs to his friend [[Charles de l'Écluse]], who acclimatized them to life in the [[Low Countries]]. Busbecq has also been credited with introducing the [[lilac]] to northern Europe (though this is debated)&lt;ref name=dicts/&gt; as well as the [[Angora goat]].&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;

==Life after Turkey==
He returned from Turkey in 1562 and became a counsellor at the court of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Ferdinand]] in [[Vienna]] and tutor to his grandchildren, the sons of future [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilian II]]. Busbecq ended his career as the guardian of [[Elisabeth of Austria (1554–1592)|Elisabeth of Austria]], Maximilian's daughter and widow of French king [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]]. He continued to serve the [[Austrian monarchy]], observing the development of the [[French Wars of Religion]] on behalf of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]]. Finally, in 1592 and nearing the end of his life, he chose to leave his residence in [[Mantes]] outside of [[Paris]] for his native [[West Flanders]], but was assaulted and robbed by members of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] near [[Rouen]]. He died a few days later. His body is buried in the castle chapel at [[Saint-Germain-sous-Cailly]] near where he died, and his heart was embalmed and sent to the family tomb in [[Bousbecque]].

'''Omayra Sánchez Garzón''' (August 28, 1972&amp;nbsp;– November 16, 1985) was a 13-year-old Colombian girl killed in [[Armero]], [[Tolima Department|Tolima]], by the [[Armero tragedy|1985 eruption]] of the [[Nevado del Ruiz]] volcano. Volcanic debris mixed with ice to form massive [[lahar]]s (volcanically induced [[mudflow]]s, [[landslide]]s, and [[debris flow]]s) that rushed into the river valleys below the mountain, killing nearly 23,000 people and destroying Armero and 13 other villages.

After a lahar demolished her home, Sánchez was pinned beneath the debris of her house, where she remained trapped in water for three days. Her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony. Her courage and dignity touched journalists and relief workers, who put great efforts into comforting her. After 60 hours of struggling, she died, likely as a result of either [[gangrene]] or [[hypothermia]]. Her death highlighted the failure of officials to respond correctly to the threat of the volcano, contrasted with the efforts of volunteer rescue workers to reach and treat trapped victims, despite inadequate supplies and equipment.

A photograph of Sánchez taken by the photojournalist [[Frank Fournier]] shortly before she died was published in news outlets around the world.  It was later designated the [[World Press Photo of the Year]] for 1985. Sánchez has remained a lasting figure in popular culture, remembered through music, literature, and commemorative articles.

== Background ==
{{main article|Armero tragedy}}
On November 13, 1985, the [[Nevado del Ruiz]] volcano erupted. At 9:09 pm of that night, [[pyroclastic flow]]s exploding from the crater melted the mountain's icecap, forming lahars (volcanic mudflows and debris flows) which cascaded into river valleys below. One lahar, consisting of three pulses, did most of the damage. Traveling at {{convert|6|m|ft|0|sp=us}} per second, the first pulse enveloped most of the town of [[Armero]], killing up to 20,000 people; the two later pulses weakened buildings. Another lahar killed 1,800 people in nearby [[Chinchiná, Caldas|Chinchiná]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martí|Ernst|2005|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total 23,000 people were killed and 13 villages in addition to Armero were destroyed.&lt;ref name=MWJ&gt;{{cite news |title=Rescuers in Colombia refuse to give up hunt for survivors |date=November 18, 1985 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal]] |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Armero aftermath Marso.jpg|left|thumb|Formerly in the center of this area, the town of Armero was buried by thick volcanic mudflows in 1985.]]

Loss of life was exacerbated by the authorities' failure to take costly preventive measures in the absence of clear signs of imminent danger.&lt;ref name=Fielding/&gt; There had been no substantial eruption of the volcano since 1845, which contributed to complacency; locals called the volcano the "Sleeping Lion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BBC:On this day: November 13: 1985: Volcano kills thousands in Colombia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/13/newsid_2539000/2539731.stm | work=[[BBC News Online]]

In September 1985, as earthquakes and [[phreatic eruption]]s rocked the area around the volcano, officials began planning for evacuation. A hazard map was prepared in October;{{#tag:ref|This was the first hazard map ever prepared for a [[List of volcanoes in Colombia|Colombian volcano]].&lt;ref name="Vil5" /&gt;|group=nb}} it highlighted the danger from falling ash and [[volcanic rock|rock]] near [[Murillo, Tolima|Murillo]], [[Santa Isabel, Tolima|Santa Isabel]], and [[Líbano, Tolima|Líbano]], as well as the threat of lahars in [[Mariquita, Tolima|Mariquita]], [[Armero-Guayabal|Guayabal]], Chinchiná, and Armero.&lt;ref name=MGueri&gt;{{cite web |url=http://desastres.unanleon.edu.ni/pdf/2004/octubre/PDF/ENG/DOC4377/doc4377-contenido.pdf |title=Eruption of El Ruiz Volcano, Colombia |last=Gueri |first=Miguel |date=October 2004 |publisher=[[National Autonomous University of Nicaragua]]-León. p. 50 |accessdate=July 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724143331/http://desastres.unanleon.edu.ni/pdf/2004/octubre/PDF/ENG/DOC4377/doc4377-contenido.pdf |archivedate=July 24, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The map was poorly distributed to those at highest risk: many survivors had never heard of it, though several major newspapers had featured it.&lt;ref name="Vil5"&gt;{{harvnb|Villegas|2003|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Villegas of the Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology stated that the maps clearly demonstrated Armero would be affected by the lahars, but had "met with strong opposition from economic interests."&lt;ref name="Villegas6" /&gt; He said that the short time between the map's preparation and the eruption hindered timely distribution.&lt;ref name="Villegas6"&gt;{{harvnb|Villegas|2003|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Colombian Congress criticised scientific and [[civil defense]] agencies for scaremongering, and the government and army were preoccupied with the [[Colombian armed conflict (1964–present)|guerrilla campaign]] in [[Bogotá]], the national capital, which was then at its height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/2009/09_10_29.html |author=Hawaiian Volcano Observatory |title=Lessons Learned from the Armero, Colombia Tragedy |date=November 29, 2009 |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The death toll was increased by the lack of early warnings,&lt;ref name=Fielding&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2001/volcanohelltrans.shtml |title=Volcano Hell Transcript |last=Fielding |first=Emma |work=[[BBC Television]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=September 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; unwise land use, as villages were built in the likely path of lahars,&lt;ref name=Touret2004/&gt; and the lack of preparedness in communities near the volcano.&lt;ref name=Fielding/&gt; Colombia's worst natural disaster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=World News Briefs |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/Newsbriefs/9511/11-14/index.html |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=November 14, 1995 |accessdate=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Armero tragedy]] (as it came to be known) was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century (surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of [[Mount Pelée]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/stratoguide/nevadofact.html |title=Nevado del Ruiz&amp;nbsp;– Facts and Figures |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |last=Staff |accessdate=September 3, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925165636/http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/stratoguide/nevadofact.html |archivedate=September 25, 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the fourth-deadliest eruption recorded since 1500 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/LivingWith/VolcanicFacts/deadly_eruptions.html|title=Deadliest Volcanic Eruptions Since 1500 A.D.|last=Topinka |first=Lyn |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate=September 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its lahars were the deadliest in volcanic history.&lt;ref name=Huggel2007/&gt;

== Life ==
Omayra Sánchez lived in the neighborhood of Santander&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt; with her parents Álvaro Enrique, a rice and [[sorghum]] collector, and María Aleida, along with her brother Álvaro Enrique&lt;ref name=DG/&gt; and aunt María Adela Garzón.&lt;ref name="Sangre"&gt;{{harvnb|Barragán|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lp/&gt;  Prior to the eruption, her mother had traveled to Bogotá on business.&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; The night of the disaster, Omayra and her family were awake, worrying about the ashfall from the eruption, when they heard the sound of an approaching lahar.&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt; After it hit, Omayra became trapped under her home's concrete and other debris and could not free herself. When rescue teams tried to help her, they realized that her legs were trapped under her house's roof.&lt;ref name=DG&gt;{{cite news |title=Trapped Girl, 13, Dies |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr.]] |date=November 17, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; Sources differ as to the degree to which Sánchez was trapped. Zeiderman (2009) said she was "trapped up to her neck",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zeiderman|2009|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Barragán (1987) said that she was trapped up to her waist.&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt;

For the first few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by concrete but got her hand through a crack in the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood over the course of a day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that it seemed she would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt;

== Death ==
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#F5F6CE |salign=left| quote = Colombia and half of the world remained with the bitter sensation that Omayra Sánchez could have been able to continue living after remaining for almost 60 hours trapped from head to toe amidst the rubble of Armero. Her face, her words, and her courage, which streamed throughout the world on television and were a heartbreaking image in the largest newspapers and magazines of the United States and Europe, remained a testimony of accusation against those who could have at the very least made the tragedy less serious.

Germán Santa María Barragán in ''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]'', November 23, 1985&lt;ref name="ZA13" /&gt;|align= right|width=300px}}

Despite her predicament, Sánchez remained relatively positive: she sang to [[Germán Santa María Barragán]], a journalist who was working as a volunteer,&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; asked for sweet food, drank soda,&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt; and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried.&lt;ref name=JSOURCE&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Canadian Journalism Foundation]] |work=Canadian Journalism Project |last=Lacey |first=Dana |title=Why We Don't Cover Pakistan |date=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the third night, Sánchez began [[hallucination|hallucinating]], saying that she did not want to be late for school,&lt;ref name=picp/&gt; and mentioned a maths exam.&lt;ref name="SA"&gt;{{harvnb|Barragán|1994|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of her life, Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, and her hands whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her, but her legs were bent under the concrete as if she was kneeling, and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs. Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die.&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt; In all, Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M.&lt;ref name="Sangre" /&gt; on November 16 from exposure,&lt;ref name=picp&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4231020.stm |title=Picture power: Tragedy of Omayra Sanchez |date=September 30, 2005 |work=[[BBC News Online]] | publisher= [[BBC]] |accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; most likely from [[gangrene]] or [[hypothermia]].&lt;ref name=JSOURCE/&gt;

Her brother survived the lahars; her father and aunt died. Her mother expressed her feelings about Omayra's death: "It is horrible, but we have to think about the living&amp;nbsp;... I will live for my son, who only lost a finger."&lt;ref name=DG/&gt;&lt;ref name=lp&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TX5WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QEENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3684,440325 |title=Ordeal Ends in Death |work=[[Leader-Post]] |publisher=Postmedia Network Inc. |date=November 18, 1985 |accessdate=April 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the public became aware of Sánchez's situation through the media, her death became a symbol of the failure of officials to properly assist victims who could have been saved.&lt;ref name="ZA13" /&gt; Controversy broke out after descriptions of the shortages were released in newspapers, disproving what officials had previously indicated: that they had used the best of their supplies. Volunteer relief workers said that there was such a lack of resources that supplies as basic as shovels, cutting tools, and stretchers ran out. The rescue process was impeded by large crowds and disorganization. An unnamed police officer said that the government should have depended on human resources to alleviate the problems and that the system of rescue was disorganized.&lt;ref name=S-N&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fbdQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3RMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5678,7662718&amp; |title=Colombian officials defend rescue effort; lack of equipment blamed |work=[[Star-News]] |publisher=Bob Gruber |date=November 24, 1985 |accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia's Minister of Defense, Miguel Uribe, said he "understood criticism of the rescue effort",&lt;ref name=S-N/&gt; but said that Colombia was "an undeveloped country" that did not "have that kind of equipment."&lt;ref name=S-N/&gt;

== Photograph ==
Frank Fournier, a French reporter who landed in Bogotá on November 15, took a photograph of Sánchez in her final days, titled "The Agony of Omayra Sánchez".&lt;ref name=ottawa&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Mq8yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=me8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3433,3016148 |title=Ottawa Man Third |date=February 7, 1986 |accessdate=April 19, 2011 |work=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |publisher=James Orban}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he reached Armero at dawn on the 16th, a farmer directed him to Sánchez, who by then had been trapped for nearly three days and was near-deserted. Fournier later described the town as "very haunting," with "eerie silence" punctuated by screaming.&lt;ref name=picp/&gt; He said that he took the photograph feeling that he could only "report properly on the courage and the suffering and the dignity of the little girl" in his attempt to publicize the disaster's need for relief efforts,&lt;ref name=picp/&gt; feeling otherwise "powerless".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zeiderman|2009|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, there was international awareness of the disaster. Sánchez was one of the victims at the center of the associated controversy over responsibility for the destructive aftermath. The image captured international attention. According to an unnamed BBC reporter, "Many were appalled at witnessing so intimately what transpired to be the last few hours of Omayra's life."&lt;ref name=picp/&gt; After the photo was published in ''[[Paris Match]],'' many accused Fournier of being "a vulture." He responded, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I felt the story was important for me to report and I was happier that there was some reaction; it would have been worse if people had not cared about it.&amp;nbsp;... I believe the photo helped raise money from around the world in aid and helped highlight the irresponsibility and lack of courage of the country's leaders." &lt;ref name=picp/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The picture later won the [[World Press Photo of the Year]] for 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PEYsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2s4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6813,1694667 |title=World Photo Award |date=February 7, 1986 |accessdate=April 19, 2011 |work=[[Spartanburg Herald-Journal]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
The Armero catastrophe came shortly after the [[19th of April Movement|M-19]] guerrilla group's raid and subsequent [[Palace of Justice siege]] on November 6, worsening an already chaotic situation. After Sánchez's death, blame for it and for the Armero tragedy fell on the Colombian government for its inaction and general indifference to warning signs prior to the volcano's eruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geology.sdsu.edu/how_volcanoes_work/Nevado.html |title=Nevado del Ruiz (1985) |last=Camp |first=Vic |publisher=[[San Diego State University]] |date=March 31, 2006 |accessdate=September 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nevado del Ruiz volcano is still active, according to the Volcano Watch Center in Colombia. Melting only 10 percent of the ice would produce mudflows with a volume of up to {{convert|200000000|m3|cuft|sigfig=3|sp=us}}—similar to the mudflow that destroyed Armero in 1985.&lt;ref name=Huggel2007&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huggel |first1=Cristian |last2=Ceballos |first2=Jorge Luis |last3=Pulgarín |first3=Bernardo |last4=Ramírez |first4=Jair |last5=Thouret |first5=Jean-Claude |title=Review and reassessment of hazards owing to volcano–glacier interactions in Colombia |year=2007 |volume=45 |journal=Annals of Glaciology |pages=128–136 |url=http://www.igsoc.org/annals/45/a45A019.pdf |doi=10.3189/172756407782282408 |format=pdf |accessdate=April 20, 2011 |bibcode = 2007AnGla..45..128H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[lahar]]s can travel up to {{convert|100|km|mi|0|sp=us}} along river valleys in a few hours.&lt;ref name=Huggel2007/&gt; Estimates show that up to 500,000 people living in the Combeima, Chinchiná, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are at risk, and 100,000 of these are considered to be at high risk.&lt;ref name=Thouret&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Thouret |first1=Jean-Claude |last2=Murcia |first2=A |last3=Salinas |first3=R. |last4=Parra |first4=E. |last5=Cepeda |first5=H. |last6=Cantagrel |first6=J-M. |title=Stratigraphy and quaternary eruptive history of the Ruiz-Tolima volcanic massif, Colombia.

The site was commemorated as a memorial with [[Christian cross]]es and a small monument to Sánchez.&lt;ref name=TJ&gt;{{cite news|title=Survivors of avalanche relive tragedy through TV movie |last=Johnson |first=Tim |date=September 18, 1997 |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |publisher=[[Journal Communications]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following the eruption, Sánchez has been repeatedly commemorated, especially in newspapers like ''El Tiempo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zeiderman|2009|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many victims of the disaster were commemorated, but Sánchez in particular has attracted lasting attention in popular poetry, novels, and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zeiderman|2009|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a [[punk rock]] band formed in Chile in 2008 named themselves Omayra Sánchez; they express their "discontent that they feel with the negligence on the part of the people who in this day and age run the world".&lt;ref name="ZA13"&gt;{{harvnb|Zeiderman|2009|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Adiós, Omayra: La catástrofe de Armero'' (1988), written by [[Eduardo Santa]] as a response to the eruption, depicts the girl's last days of life in detail and cites her in its introduction as an eternal symbol of the catastrophe.&lt;ref name="ZA13" /&gt; In ''No Morirás'' (1994), Germán Santa María Barragán writes that of all the horrors he saw at Armero, nothing was more painful than seeing the face of Omayra Sánchez under the ruins of her house.&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; [[Isabel Allende]]'s [[short story]], "And of Clay Are We Created" ("De barro estamos hechos"), is told from the perspective of a reporter who tries to help a girl trapped under the fireplace of her ruined home. Allende later wrote, "Her [Sánchez's] big black eyes, filled with resignation and wisdom, still pursue me in my dreams. Writing the story failed to exorcise her ghost."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Correas de Zapata |Sayers Peden|2002|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To try to prevent repetition of such a disaster, the government of Colombia created the ''Oficina Nacional para la Atención de Desastres'' (National Office for Disaster Preparedness), now known as the ''Dirección de Prevención y Atención de Desastres'' (Directorate for Disaster Prevention and Preparedness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnp.gov.co/PortalWeb/Programas/ViviendaAguaDesarrolloUrbanoAmbiente/Gesti%C3%B3ndelRiesgo/Direcci%C3%B3ndePrevenci%C3%B3nyAtenci%C3%B3ndeDesastres.aspx |title=Dirección de Prevención y Atención de Desastres — DPAD |date=June 24, 2010 |publisher=Departamento Nacional de Planeación, República de Colombia |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002214757/http://www.dnp.gov.co/PortalWeb/Programas/ViviendaAguaDesarrolloUrbanoAmbiente/Gesti%C3%B3ndelRiesgo/Direcci%C3%B3ndePrevenci%C3%B3nyAtenci%C3%B3ndeDesastres.aspx |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All Colombian cities were directed to plan for natural disasters.&lt;ref name=Touret2004&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Touret |first1=Jean-Claude |last2=Laforge |first2=Christophe |title=Hazard Appraisal and Hazard-Zone Mapping of Flooding and Debris Flowage in the Rio Combeima Valley and Ibague City, Tolima Department, Colombia |journal=GeoJournal |year=1994 |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=407–413 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/j7h51t87x7201375 |accessdate=August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Anderson Sessions''' (born March 22, 1955) is an American [[politician]]. He has represented [[Texas's 32nd congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] since 2003. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He is the current chairman of the [[House Rules Committee]] and a former chairman of the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrcc.org/about/nrcc-leadership/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110601192457/http://www.nrcc.org/about/nrcc-leadership/ |date=June 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was defeated for re-election by Democratic challenger [[Colin Allred]] in the November 6, 2018 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=October 2008|title=2008 Election Results Update|journal=Anthropology News|volume=49|issue=7|pages=18|doi=10.1111/an.2008.49.7.18.3|issn=1541-6151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education, and business career==
Sessions was born in [[Waco, Texas]], the son of Alice June (née Lewis) and [[William S. Sessions|William Steele Sessions]], the former director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/sessions.htm |title=sessions |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in Waco and in the suburbs of [[Washington, DC]]. He graduated from [[Southwestern University]] in [[Georgetown, Texas]] in 1978, where he was a member of the [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] fraternity. He worked for [[Southwestern Bell]] for 16 years and rose to the rank of district manager for marketing in Dallas.

The [[Boy Scouts of America]] recognized him as a "Distinguished Eagle Scout." He holds a position on the [[Circle Ten Council]] of the BSA. Both of his sons are also active in scouting.&lt;ref name="downoa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13520.html|title=Pols discuss raising special-needs kids|last=Lovley|first=Erika|date=2008-09-17|publisher=Politico|accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Campaigns===
In his 1991 election bid, Sessions finished sixth [[Texas's 3rd congressional district special election, 1991|in a special election]] for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. In 1993, he left his job with Southwestern Bell to again run for Congress, against 5th District [[incumbent]] [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] Congressman [[John Wiley Bryant|John Bryant]]. He toured the district with a livestock trailer full of horse manure, claiming that the [[Clinton Administration]]'s health care plan stank more than the manure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=2014 Almanac of American Politics |last2=Barone |first2=Chuck |last1=McCutcheon|first1=Michael |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost by 2,400 votes. He subsequently became vice president for public policy at the [[National Center for Policy Analysis]] (NCPA), a Dallas-based conservative public policy research institute.

[[File:Representative Pete Sessions in 1998.jpg|thumb|Sessions at the Capitol in 1998]]
In 1996, when Bryant decided to seek a [[United States Senate|Senate]] seat, Sessions was elected to succeed him in the 5th District, defeating Democratic candidate John Pouland with 47 percent of the vote. He was re-elected in 1998, defeating schoolteacher Victor Morales with 56 percent of the vote. In 2000, he ran against [[Regina Montoya Coggins]], and was re-elected with 54 percent of the vote. When redistricting after the 2000 Census made the 5th slightly more Democratic, he moved to the newly created 32nd District for the 2002 election, in which he ran against Pauline Dixon and won the district with 68 percent of the vote.

In 2004, Sessions defeated 13-term, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] Congressman [[Martin Frost]], who had moved to the 32nd after the [[2003 Texas redistricting|redistricting in 2003]] eliminated Frost's former district. He won 54–44%, in what was considered the most expensive U.S. House race in the nation. According to the Associated Press, "The race also was one of the nastiest, with Frost unearthing a decades-old streaking incident by Sessions in his college days and questioning his commitment to security with an ad featuring the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] towers in flames. In response, he criticized Frost for booking [[Peter Yarrow]] of the 1960s group [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] for a fundraiser. Yarrow had faced an indecency with a child charge years earlier."

In 2010, he faced [[Dallas]] businessman and attorney [[Grier Raggio]] and Libertarian John Jay Myers. The election was initially considered one of the top dark horse battles in the country, but Sessions won re-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blake |first=Aaron |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/49503-dark-horse-races-to-watch-in-2010 |title=Dark horse races to watch in 2010 |publisher=TheHill.com |date=2009-07-06 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he faced the Democratic candidate, Katherine Savers McGovern, and independent, Seth Hollis. He was endorsed by the ''Dallas Morning News'' and won re-election. In the 2014 Republican primary, Sessions defeated [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] [[Katrina Pierson]], an [[African American]] and a favorite of the [[Tea Party movement]]. He polled 28,954 votes (63.6 percent) to her 16,560 (36.4 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=218&amp;id=176|title=Republican primary election returns, March 4, 2014|publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=March 5, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140305180619/https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=218&amp;id=176|archivedate=March 5, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierson, originally allied with U.S. Senator [[Ted Cruz]], later joined the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump presidential campaign]] staff.

In 2016, Sessions polled 49,632 votes (61.4 percent) to gain re-nomination in the Republican congressional primary, which had a much greater turnout than in 2014. The runner-up, Russ K. Ramsland of Dallas, received 19,105 votes (23.6%). Paul M. Brown of Richardson received 9,488 votes (11. 7%).  Cherie Myint Roughneen received 2601 votes (3.2%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://enrpages.sos.state.tx.us/public/mar01_273_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=4540&amp;id=516 |title=Republican primary returns |date=March 1, 2016 |publisher=Texas Secretary of State |accessdate=March 4, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306144151/https://enrpages.sos.state.tx.us/public/mar01_273_state.htm?x=0&amp;y=4540&amp;id=516 |archivedate=March 6, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lost his bid for re-election in 2018 to [[Colin Allred]].

===Republican Party leadership positions===
In the 2010 election, during his tenure as chairman of the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]], the party gained control of the House with significant gains. They won a net gain of 63 seats and 89 new freshman members.&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson, John R., [http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pete-sessions-running-majority-whip-seeks-reelection-nrcc/story?id=12082535#.UHcWyq5Wq7w "Exclusive: Sessions Not Running for Majority Whip, Seeks Reelection at NRCC"], ABC, Nov. 8, 2010. Retrieved October 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Sessions was originally a candidate for the post of [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House majority leader]], to replace [[Eric Cantor]].&lt;ref&gt;Evan Halper &amp; Richard Simon, [http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-house-leadership-20140612-story.html Race for Eric Cantor's House post may be between Californian, Texan], ''Los Angeles Times'' (June 11, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sessions withdrew from the internal [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference]] election, leaving the field clear for [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] of California.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Mascaro &amp; Michael A. Memoli, [http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-sessions-drops-out-of-race-for-gop-leadership-clears-way-for-californias-mccarthy-20140612-story.html Sessions drops out of GOP leadership race, clearing way for McCarthy], ''Los Angeles Times'' (June 12, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matt Fuller,

==Tenure==
As of August 2017, Sessions voted with his party in 98.8% of votes so far in the current ([[115th United States Congress|115th]]) session of Congress and voted in line with President Trump's position in 97.5% of votes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/pete-sessions/|title=Tracking Pete Sessions In The Age Of Trump|last=Bycoffe|first=Aaron|date=2017-01-30|work=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://projects.propublica.org/represent/members/S000250-pete-sessions|title=Represent|last=Willis|first=Derek|work=ProPublica|access-date=August 30, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casinos===
In late 2001 and early 2002, he cosigned letters to two [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]] members asking them to shut down [[Native American gaming|casinos operated by several Native American tribes]]. Within 18 months of sending the letters, he received a total of $20,500 from tribes associated with [[Jack Abramoff]]. In response to criticism, his office said that he wrote the letters because of his view that gambling is a local issue, falling under his long-held support for [[federalism]].&lt;ref name="dallasnews_20060106"&gt;{{Cite news | last=Gillman | first=Todd J. | title=Sessions, others in casino crusade got tribal cash | newspaper=[[The Dallas Morning News]] | date=2006-01-06 | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/washington/stories/DN-casinomoney_06nat.ART.State.Edition2.1da84a95.html | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earmarks===
In 2008, he added a $1.6 million [[earmark (politics)|earmark]] to an [[appropriations bill]], for [[dirigible]] research. The earmark benefited a [[Chicago]] company, Jim G. Ferguson &amp; Associates, which had no experience in [[government contracting]] or dirigible research. Former Sessions aide and convicted [[felony|felon]] Adrian Plesha was a [[lobbyist]] for the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0709/25599.html |title=Pete Sessions's blimp flies into storm |first= John |last=Bresnahan|publisher=Politico |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuffner |first=Charles |url=http://offthekuff.com/wp/?p=12587 |title=CREW goes after Sessions |publisher=Off the Kuff |date=2006-04-19 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, Adrian Plesha sued Jim G. Ferguson &amp; Associates for non-payment of fees and expenses connected with his [[lobbying]] effort on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/26644.html |title=Lobbyist sues in wake of blimp pork |first= John |last=Bresnahan |publisher=Politico |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magic===
In March 2016, Sessions introduced a House resolution to "recognize magic as a rare and valuable art form and national treasure."&lt;ref name="HR642"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-resolution/642|title=Recognizing magic as a rare and valuable art form and national treasure|work=114th Congress (2015-2016)|publisher= Library of Congress|date=14 March 2016|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/06/10/481558716/david-copperfield-wants-congress-to-believe-in-magic|title=David Copperfield Wants Congress To Believe In Magic|first=Susan|last=Davis|work=All Things Considered|publisher=NPR|date=10 June 2016|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cannabis ===
Sessions opposes allowing states to determine their own policies regarding the legality of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] and the regulation of legal cannabis markets. As chairman of the [[House Rules Committee]], he has repeatedly stifled proposed [[Amend (motion)|amendments]] relaxing federal laws against cannabis, including an amendment that would have allowed medical marijuana access to veterans in states where the drug is legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/03/21/washingtons-most-powerful-anti-pot-official-is-named-sessions-its-not-who-you-think-217662 |work=[[Politico]] |date=March 21, 2018 |title=Washington's Most Powerful Anti-Pot Official Is Named Sessions. It's Not Who You Think. |accessdate=April 3, 2018 |first=James |last=Higdon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military and police ===
Sessions is a supporter of the [[1033 program]], under which the U.S. military transfers surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies; the program is controversial because of its association with [[militarization of police]]. In 2015 and 2017, Sessions cosponsored Republican legislation to reverse the Obama administration's restrictions on the 1033 program.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Krause  &amp; Caroline Kelly, [https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2017/08/28/trump-allows-local-police-stock-high-powered-military-vehicles-gear Trump allows local police to stock up on high-powered military vehicles and gear], ''Dallas News'' (August 28, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hurricane aid ===
In 2012, Sessions voted against [[Hurricane Sandy relief bill|disaster relief for the victims of Hurricane Sandy]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/348335-lawmakers-vow-harvey-aid-package-but-theres-no-plan-yet|title=Lawmakers vow Harvey aid package, but there's no plan yet|last=Swanson|first=Ian|date=2017-08-28|work=The Hill|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2017, in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, which devastated parts of Texas, Sessions called for disaster relief for the victims of Harvey.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hurricane-harvey-texas-republicans-sandy-hypocrisy_us_59a46fcce4b041393a1fc43a|title=Hurricane Harvey And The Potential Hypocrisy Of Texas Republicans|last=Fuller|first=Matt|date=2017-08-28|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-08-30|last2=Subberwal|first2=Kaeli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Office of Congressional Ethics===
In 2016, Sessions criticized the independent, nonpartisan [[Office of Congressional Ethics]] (OCE), saying that the office was "a political witch hunt" and calling it "an outside process that's very controversial, is not working well and is highly unpopular because of its original mandate and jurisdiction is hugely flawed."&lt;ref&gt;Rema Rahman, [https://www.rollcall.com/policy/congressman-takes-aim-ethics-agency Congressman Takes Aim at Ethics Agency], ''Roll Call'' (June 9, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Sessions publicly defended a House Republican plan to dismantle the OCE; the plan was abandoned after a public uproar.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron Joseph &amp; Adam Edelman, [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/trump-calls-house-republicans-dismantling-ethics-watchdog-article-1.2932904 House Republicans cancel plan to dismantle ethics watchdog after backlash, opposition from Trump], ''New York Daily News'' (January 3, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environment ===
Also in 2017, Sessions sponsored a bill to delay, for nine years, the full implementation of 2015 ozone standards set by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] under the Obama administration; the bill passed the House, largely on party lines.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Kelly, [https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2017/07/18/house-approves-texans-bill-delay-obama-era-ozone-standards-reducing-pollution House approves Texan's bill to delay Obama-era ozone standards for reducing pollution], ''Dallas News'' (July 18, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Sessions supported the [[North Texas Invasive Species Barrier Act of 2014]], a bill that would exempt the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) from prosecution under the [[Lacey Act]] for transferring water containing [[invasive species]] from [[Oklahoma]] to Texas.&lt;ref name="cbo4032"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45202|title=H.R. 4032|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lacey Act protects plants and wildlife by creating civil and criminal penalties for various violations, including transferring invasive species across state borders.&lt;ref name="cbo4032" /&gt; Sessions argued that the bill was necessary to prevent "more than 1.5 million customers of the North Texas Municipal Water District" from facing "restricted access to water as a result of the discovery of invasive species in Lake Texoma."&lt;ref name="sessionsPR"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://sessions.house.gov/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=6F5117C9-B4E6-4E44-8396-B76DAB872C3D|title=Pete Sessions Applauds Passage of the North Texas Invasive Species Barrier Act of 2014|date=28 April 2014|publisher=Office of U.S. Representative Pete Sessions|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orlando shooting ===
Sessions drew controversy in 2016 when he asserted that the site of the [[Pulse nightclub]] in Orlando, the scene of a [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting|mass shooting attack]], was not a gay club.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/283473-sessions-says-orlando-nightclub-was-not-gay-club|title=Pete Sessions says Orlando shooting site was not gay club|last=Savransky|first=Rebecca|date=2016-06-14|work=TheHill|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/283531-house-gop-leaders-block-lgbt-vote-after-orlando-shooting|title=House GOP leaders block LGBT vote after Orlando shooting|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|date=2016-06-14|work=The Hill|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health care ===
Sessions opposes abortion and supports defunding [[Planned Parenthood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Miller |first1=Bill |title=Allred vs. Sessions: A Congressional Race To Watch |url=https://www.prestonhollowpeople.com/2018/09/25/allred-vs-sessions-a-congressional-race-to-watch/ |accessdate=5 October 2018 |publisher=Preston Hollow People |date=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sessions favors repealing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (ACA or "Obamacare").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/bill/19507/51283/288/repeal-of-the-patient-protection-and-affordable-care-act-and-health-care-related-provisions-in-the-health-care-and-education-reconciliation-act-of-2010#.VcCuf6ow8dU|title=The Voter's Self Defense System|website=Vote Smart|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sessions supported the March 2017 version of the [[American Health Care Act of 2017|American Health Care Act]], the House Republicans' replacement plan for the ACA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/20/us/politics/health-care-whip-count.html|title=How House Republicans Planned to Vote on the Obamacare Replacement|date=2017-03-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-04|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 4, 2017, he voted to repeal the ACA and pass the American Health Care Act.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/ahca-house-vote/|title=How the House voted to pass the GOP health-care bill|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/04/health-care-vote-puts-pressure-dozens-vulnerable-gop-reps/101297824/|title=Health care vote puts pressure on dozens of vulnerable GOP reps|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race===
In September 2010, Sessions remarked after watching the [[Princeton University]] [[Princeton Tigers men's basketball|men's basketball team]], "How often can you go see a bunch of white guys play basketball?" He also reportedly said that the players stayed entirely below the rim. The comments were described as an allusion to the phrase "[[White Men Can't Jump]]", and were labeled as inappropriate by [[New Jersey]] Democratic Rep.

Less than two weeks after his "white guys" comments he made controversial comments about the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC) giving money to and supporting, "[[African Americans]] like [[Sanford Bishop]]. And when you have to retreat back to ... your hard base you're having to make tough decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/10/nrcc-chair-makes-racially-insensitive-remarks.php|title=NRCC Chair Makes Racially Insensitive Remarks|publisher=Talking Points Memo|accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Democrats &amp; African-Americans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/50586-1.html?ET=rollcall:e8901:80042083a:&amp;st=email|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101012044208/http://www.rollcall.com/news/50586-1.html?ET=rollcall:e8901:80042083a:&amp;st=email|dead-url=yes|archive-date=October 12, 2010|title=Democrats &amp; African-Americans|publisher=Roll Call|accessdate=October 7, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration and citizenship===
Sessions voted against the [[DREAM Act]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://projects.propublica.org/represent/votes/111/house/2/625 House Vote 625 - Approves DREAM Act: H.R.5281], Represent, ProPublica.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sessions supported President [[Donald Trump]]'s 2017 [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] imposing a temporary ban on immigration from seven predominantly Muslim nations. He stated that "Just as President Obama suspended the refugee program in 2011 for six months, the Trump Administration is working to protect national security by making adjustments in the refugee vetting process. It is critical that we address the threat of individuals who come to our country to create chaos and threaten our freedom."&lt;ref name="Blake1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=Coffman, Gardner join Republicans against President Trump's travel ban; here's where the rest stand|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/29/republicans-on-trump-travel-ban/|website=Denver Post|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Sessions suggested that Congress could appropriate funds for part of construction of a [[Executive Order 13767|U.S.-Mexico border wall demanded by Trump]] as part of "a Republican-only bill" to [[Continuing resolution|continue funding the government]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallory Shelbourne, [http://thehill.com/homenews/house/330188-gop-rep-congress-will-find-a-way-to-avoid-shutdown GOP rep: Funding bill could include Trump's border wall], ''The Hill''(April 24, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ties to Allen Stanford===
Sessions came under scrutiny for his personal ties to disgraced banker [[Allen Stanford]],&lt;ref name="miamiherald1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sallah |first=Michael |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2009/12/27/v-fullstory/1399470/feds-probe-banker-allen-stanfords.html |title=Feds probing Congress' ties to disgraced banker Stanford|newspaper=Miami Herald|date=December 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in 2012 was convicted of orchestrating a $7 billion [[Ponzi scheme]].&lt;ref name="Waas"&gt;Murray Waas, [https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3b75n3/congressman-pete-sessions-and-r-allen-stanford New Disclosures About a Congressman's Relationship with a Now-Imprisoned Texas Billionaire], VICE News (June 12, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Sessions received over $44,000 in political contributions from Stanford and his associates.&lt;ref name="miamiherald1"/&gt; Sessions also took multiple trips to Fire Island and to the [[Caribbean]] to attend Stanford-sponsored events; these trips included private travel on Stanford's fleet of jets and accommodations.&lt;ref name="miamiherald1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waas"/&gt; In 2014, [[VICE News]] obtained records from Stanford's internal files that indicated that in 2007 and 2008, before the scandal came to light, Sessions had intervened with the [[U.S. Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]]'s [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]], on Stanford's behalf, allowing him to bypass certain [[embargo against Cuba|Cuban embargo]] restrictions.&lt;ref name="Waas"/&gt; Additionally, in 2004, Sessions (along with two other Republican congressmen, [[Bob Ney]] and [[John E. Sweeney]]) wrote to [[Venezuela]]n banking regulators, "vouching for Stanford's character when Stanford was trying to obtain a charter to open a bank in the country, at a time when regulators there were reluctant because of reports they had received that Stanford was running a Ponzi scheme and engaged in money laundering."&lt;ref name="Waas"/&gt;

===Russia===
In 2017, Sessions, as chairman of the House Rules Committee, stalled a bill imposing additional [[sanctions against Russia]] and [[Sanctions against Iran|Iran]] from moving to the floor; Sessions expressed the view that some parts of the bill, which passed the Senate on a 98-2 vote, could create "huge problems to companies in Dallas, Texas, that I represent" and place them at a competitive disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Walsh &amp; Jeremy Herb, [http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/29/politics/russia-sanctions-bill-senate/index.html Russia sanctions bill still stuck in Congress before Trump-Putin meeting], CNN (June 29, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Sessions argued that it was unnecessary to increase federal funding for election security.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/house-gop-refuses-to-renew-election-security-funding-as-democrats-fume-over-russian-meddling/2018/07/18/20761f88-8abb-11e8-8aea-86e88ae760d8_story.html|title=House GOP refuses to renew election security funding as Democrats fume over Russian interference|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-election-security-funding-russian-meddling-20180718-story.html|title=House GOP votes against renewing election security funding as Democrats fume|last=Werner|first=Erica|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US intelligence community had concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election and that it was continuing to interfere in election systems as of July 2018.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Legislative strategy===
In early February 2009, Sessions made the following comment about the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] legislative strategy in the House of Representatives: "Insurgency, we understand perhaps a little bit more because of the Taliban", he said, during the 60-minute sitdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/05/sessions-stimulus-and-the-taliban/?_r=0 | title =Sessions, Stimulus and the Taliban | first=Bernie |last=Becker | work =nytimes.com | date =February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "And that is that they went about systematically understanding how to disrupt and change a person's entire processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2009/02/well_fight_them_in_the_mountai | title =Learning from the Taliban | work =The Economist | date =February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued: "I'm not trying to say the Republican Party is the [[Taliban]].... I'm saying an example of how you go about [it] is to change a person from their messaging to their operations to their frontline message. And we need to understand that insurgency may be required when the other side, the House leadership, does not follow the same commands, which we entered the game with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/glennthrush/0209/Pete_Sessions_House_GOP_learning_from_Taliban.html | title =Pete Sessions: House GOP learning from Taliban |first =Glenn |last=Thrush | publisher =Politico | date =February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Countrywide Financial loan===
In January 2012, it was reported that Sessions received a so-called "VIP" or "Friends of Angelo" loan in 2007 from troubled mortgage lender [[Bank of America Home Loans|Countrywide Financial]], in which loans were granted at lower interest rates than were available to the public. Former Countrywide CEO [[Angelo Mozilo]] created the program to boost the company's standing with politicians, celebrities and well-connected business figures. He received a $1 million loan from Countrywide at below-market rates, which he never declared in financial disclosures. His, as well as names of other legislators who received similar loans were subsequently referred to the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]] as part of an ethics investigation into improper gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sessions got Countrywide VIP loan|url=http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=212ECF88-A719-466E-BF8D-F46EAB58E2A5|date=2012-01-17|publisher=[[Politico]]|first=John|last=Bresnahan|accessdate=2012-01-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513055616/http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=212ECF88-A719-466E-BF8D-F46EAB58E2A5|archivedate=2013-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mozilo Tied to Loan to Top Lawmaker |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204468004577167311547612288|date=2012-01-18|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|first=John|last=Emshwiller|accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]] when their investigation revealed he did not receive any preferential treatment or a below market interest rate on his mortgage from Countrywide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pete Sessions cleared of wrongdoing in Countrywide loan scandal |first=Victoria |last=Pelham |newspaper=Dallas Morning News |date=2012-07-05 |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/headlines/20120705-pete-sessions-cleared-of-wrongdoing-in-countrywide-loan-scandal.ece |accessdate=2012-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implication regarding the French===
During the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|2013 government shutdown]], after being questioned by another individual regarding his position on the shutdown and his presence at the [[National World War II Memorial]], which was open while other [[National Park Service]] monuments and parks remained closed, he replied that "we're not the French; we don't surrender."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weigel|first=David|title=GOP Congressman on Shutdown: "We're Not French.

===Other===
In 2008, Sessions introduced legislation that created a [[Boy Scouts of America centennial silver dollar|commemorative silver dollar coin]] celebrating the centennial of the [[Boy Scouts of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coinnews.net/2008/04/28/boy-scouts-of-america-silver-dollar-centennial-commemorative-coin-4056], ''Coin News'' (April 28, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed the House on a 403-8 vote and passed the Senate unanimously; it was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/5872/summary/36 H.R.5872 - Boy Scouts of America Centennial Commemorative Coin Act: 110th Congress (2007-2008)], Congress.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phineas Fay Clanton''' (December 1843 – January 5, 1906) was the son of [[Newman Haynes Clanton]] and the brother of  [[Billy Clanton|Billy]] and [[Ike Clanton]]. He was witness to and possibly played a part in a number of illegal activities during his life. He moved frequently in his early life from Missouri to California and to Arizona.

Their [[Newman Haynes Clanton|father]] was implicated in the ambush and murder of a number of Mexican smugglers in July 1881. The following month he was killed by Mexican [[Rurales]]. Phin's brother [[Ike Clanton]] had an ongoing series of conflicts with Deputy U.S. Marshal [[Virgil Earp]] and was accused of cattle rustling among other things. Phin and his brothers developed bitter and angry feelings for the Earps. During the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]] on October 26, 1881, Ike escaped unharmed but their brother [[Billy Clanton|Billy]] was killed. Ike and Phin were accused of attempting to murder Virgil in December and assassinating [[Morgan Earp]] two months later, but [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboy]] friends vouched for their presence in Contention, {{convert|12|mi}} away.

Phin had numerous other brushes with the law during his life. He and his brother Ike moved to northern Arizona near their sister and her husband, Eben Stanley. The three men developed a reputation for [[cattle raiding|stealing livestock]]. The grand jury indicted them and Ike was killed while [[resisting arrest]]. Phin served one year and five months of his 10-year prison term. He married late in life and four years later died after contracting pneumonia.

==Early life==

{{details|topic=his early life|Newman Haynes Clanton}}

"Phin" or "Fin" was born in [[Callaway County, Missouri]], to [[Newman Haynes Clanton]] and Mariah Sexton Kelso. Phin had six siblings: John Wesley, [[Ike Clanton|Joseph Issac]], [[Billy Clanton|William Harrison]], Alonzo Peter, Mary Elise and Ester Ann. The family moved frequently during his youth, from Missouri to [[Adams County, Illinois]], in 1851 and then to [[Dallas, Texas]], in 1853. The Clantons had repeated scrapes with the law. Both Newman and his oldest son John Wesley were convicted of desertion during the Civil War. They developed a reputation for theft and thuggery that followed them to Arizona.&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Paul Lee|title=The McLaurys in Tombstone, Arizona: an O. K. Corral Obituary|publisher=University of North Texas Press|location=Denton, Tex.|isbn=978-1574414509|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mkLyIwACxO8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=frank+mclaury#v=onepage|edition=First |year=2012 |pages=416}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Phin was 20, the family moved again to [[Fort Bowie]], [[Arizona Territory]] and then the next year to [[Ventura, California|San Buenaventura]] and after that to [[Port Hueneme, California]]. Phin’s mother Mariah died in 1866 while en route to California.

In 1869, at 24 years old, Phin was living in [[Lone Pine, California]], with his oldest brother John Wesley Clanton and his wife Nancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Phin Clanton Family History|url=http://www.clantongang.com/oldwest/gangphin.html|last=Clanton|first=Terry| publisher=Tombstone, Arizona.com|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years later he returned to the [[Arizona Territory]] in 1873 to the [[Gila River]] valley to help his father [[Newman Haynes Clanton]] build up [[Clantonville, Arizona|Clantonville]], a farming community his father founded in Gila Valley, Arizona. His father purchased or squatted on a large tract of land outside [[Camp Thomas (Arizona)|Camp Thomas]], but his plans for a new town failed to materialize. His father resumed cattle ranching and most of his children later followed him to Arizona.&lt;ref name="johnson" /&gt;

==Ranching in Charleston==

{{details|topic=ranching in the Tombstone area|Cochise County in the Old West}}

In 1877, Phin moved with his [[Newman Haynes Clanton|father]] about {{convert|100|mi}} south to land on the [[San Pedro River (Arizona)|San Pedro River]], about {{convert|8|mi}} up river from [[Charleston, Arizona|Charleston]], [[Arizona Territory]]. There he helped build a large [[adobe]] house which became the headquarters of the Clanton Ranch. Phin also obtained work as a freight driver.&lt;ref name=phinclanton&gt;{{cite web|last=Clanton|first=Terry|title=Phin Clanton 1843-1905|url=http://clantongang.com/oldwest/gangphin.html| publisher=TombstoneArizona.com|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same time period, prospector [[Ed Schieffelin]] discovered  [[silver]] in the hills east of the [[San Pedro River (Arizona)|San Pedro River]] on a plateau known as Goose Flats, less than {{convert|15|mi}} from the Clanton ranch. The family was very well situated to meet the demands for beef from the [[boomtown|booming town]] of  [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]. From its founding in March 1879, it grew from 100 residents to upwards of 15,000 citizens at its peak less than a decade later.&lt;ref name=tombstoneweb&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Tombstone|url=http://www.tombstoneweb.com/history.html|publisher=TombstoneWeb.com|accessdate=3 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625071235/http://www.tombstoneweb.com/history.html|archivedate=25 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the mines built stamping mills on the San Pedro River about {{convert|5|mi}} south of their ranch, a town named Charleston was built up to support them, providing the Clantons with another market for their beef.

Phin's father was implicated in the [[Skeleton Canyon Massacre|First Skeleton Canyon Massacre]] in July 1881, and a month later "Old Man" Clanton was killed while driving a herd of stolen cattle through Guadalupe Canyon near the Mexican border.&lt;ref name=phinclanton/&gt; Old Man Clanton was buried where he died.  In 1882 Phin and Ike exhumed their father's body and moved it to the [[Boot Hill]] cemetery in Tombstone. Newman Clanton was re-interred alongside his son [[Billy Clanton]] who had been killed in the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]].

==Conflict with Earps==

{{see also|Gunfight at the O.K. Corral|Earp Vendetta Ride}}

Phin's brother [[Billy Clanton|Billy]] was killed during the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral]]. Ike Clanton filed murder charges against Deputy U.S. Marshal and Tombstone Police chief [[Virgil Earp]], Assistant Marshal [[Morgan Earp]], and temporary deputies [[Wyatt Earp]] and [[Doc Holliday]], but they were exonerated after a contentious month-long preliminary hearing. Ike attempted to re-file murder charges in Contention, but his move was rejected for lack of new evidence. On December 28, 1881, Virgil Earp  was ambushed and seriously wounded by hidden assailants.  Virgil was left without use of his left arm. Phin and his brother Ike were both arrested for the attempted murder, but Cowboy friends bore witness that they had both been in Charleston, about {{convert|12|mi}} away when the shooting took place, and they were released.

Wyatt was appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal in Virgil's place. Wyatt deputized several men who guarded Virgil and his wife Allie on their way to Tucson and a train ride back to [[Colton, California]], and their parent's home where he could recuperate in safety. In Tucson, Wyatt spotted [[Frank Stilwell]] lying in wait near the railroad tracks and killed him. Pima County Sheriff [[Robert H. Paul|Bob Paul]] issued a warrant for their arrest. When Cochise County Sheriff [[Johnny Behan]] received the warrant, he assembled his own posse composed of friends of Frank Stilwell and Ike Clanton, including Phin, [[Pete Spence]], [[Johnny Ringo]],  [[Johnny Barnes]] and about 18 more men. They rode after the federal posse and the five men wanted for Stilwell's murder.&lt;ref name=phinclanton/&gt;&lt;ref name="legends"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-earpvendetta.html|title=Earp Vendetta Ride |publisher=Legends of America |accessdate=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cochise County posse tracked Wyatt Earp's Federal posse as it was looking for the Cowboys who had attacked his brothers, seeking [[Earp Vendetta Ride|vengeance]], but the two posses never met during the two-week-long pursuit.

Behan's posse almost caught up with the Earp posse on the morning of March 27 at the Sierra Bonita ranch of [[Henry Hooker|Henry C. Hooker]], a wealthy and prominent rancher.&lt;ref name="historynet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/wyatt-earps-vendetta-posse.htm/1|title=Wyatt Earp's Vendetta Posse|date=January 29, 2007|accessdate=February 18, 2011|publisher=HistoryNet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Behan's men were spotted in the distance, Hooker suggested Wyatt make his stand there, but Wyatt moved into the hills about three miles distant near Reilly Hill.&lt;ref name=roberts&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Roberts | first1 = Gary L. | title = Doc Holliday: The Life and Legend | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley, J | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-470-12822-0 | page = 544 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|238}}  When Sheriff Behan and his posse arrived at the Sierra Bonita ranch, Hooker refused them assistance. One report said Hooker told Behan where to look for the Earps but the posse left in the opposite direction.&lt;ref name=historynet/&gt;

==Raises cattle and goats==

In June 1882 Phin moved {{convert|200|mi}} north to [[Springerville, Arizona|Springerville]], [[Apache County, Arizona|Apache County]], where his sister Mary Elsie lived with her husband Eben Stanley, a recipient of the [[Medal of Honor]] while fighting with the [[5th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|5th U.S. Cavalry]] under General [[George Crook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{findagrave|23272915}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ike Clanton arrived in August. By 1885, both brothers had bought a [[Section (United States land surveying)|quarter-section]] of land ({{convert|160|acres}}) 10 miles east of Springerville near the New Mexico border. Eben assisted Phin and Ike in getting their cattle business started.

Two years later, on December 27, 1885, the Apache County treasurer’s office was broken into. Deputy Treasurer Francisco Baca claimed that although the robbers were masked, he recognized the men as Phin and Ike Clanton, Eben Stanley and Lee Renfro of Springerville, and Mr. Buck Henderson of St. Johns. During the trial the court found that Baca had made up the story to cover his embezzling activities. He was later tried and convicted of stealing $11,166.54.&lt;ref name=phinclanton/&gt;

==Phin and Ike indicted==

Stanley and the two Clanton brothers were suspected of stealing cattle from the Springerville area and taking them south via the [[Blue River (Arizona)|Blue River]] to [[Clifton, Arizona]], and other southern towns to sell.&lt;ref name=becker&gt;{{cite web|last=Becker|first=Jack A.|title=Commodore Perry Owens Helped Clean up Apache County| url=http://www.roundvalleyaz.com/owens2.html|publisher=roundvalleyaz.com|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Clanton-Stanley outfits" were regarded as [[cattle raiding|rustlers]] and had been a "terror for years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pacific Reporter|date=April 18 – August 15, 1889|volume=21|location=St. Paul|series=West Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apache County, Arizona|Apache County]] Sheriff [[Perry Owens]] and the local Stock Association decided to pursue indictments against them.

On March 1, 1887, George Powell testified before the [[grand jury]] implicating Ike, Phin, Eben, Charles Gray, Robert Gray, and Lee Renfro in [[cattle raiding|livestock theft]]. An arrest warrant for Lee Renfro had already been issued on February 26 for the shooting death in November 1886 of Isaac Ellenger at Phin's Cienega Amarilla Ranch. Phin had allegedly given Renfro a horse to enable his escape.&lt;ref name=becker/&gt; The [[grand jury]] returned 15 indictments the same day accusing Phin of [[grand larceny]].

Phin was arrested and jailed on April 30. During May more livestock were stolen and on May 14 deputies Albert Millet, George Powell and Detective Jonas V. Brighton left Springerville, Arizona to track down the stolen horses and mules. They followed the trail to "Peg-leg" Jim Wilson's ranch on Eagle Creek. They arrived on the evening of May 31 and spent the night. Early the next morning Ike Clanton rode up to the door on horseback. When the lawmen answered his knock, he immediately recognized them. He turned his horse to flee and withdrew his rifle from his scabbard. Detective Brighton shot Ike through the heart and he died before he hit the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joseph Isaac "Ike" Clanton|url=http://www.pictures.eaglefreeenterprises.com/ike_clanton.htm|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 8 Renfro was found and was also killed while resisting arrest.&lt;ref name=becker/&gt;

In September 1887 Phin was found guilty and was sentenced to 10 years in the [[Yuma Territorial Prison|Yuma Arizona State Prison]]. While serving his sentence, it was discovered that the prosecution’s primary witness that led to Phin’s conviction had lied on the stand so he could collect the $250 reward. On March 15, 1889, after serving only one year and five months, he was pardoned by Governor [[Meyer Zulick]] and was released on March 24, 1889.&lt;ref name=phinclanton/&gt;

After his release, Phin and his friend [[Pete Spence]] began raising [[Angora goat]]s on what is now the Bohme Allotment&lt;ref name=gilatales&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.paysonroundup.com/news/2004/feb/24/tales_of_gila/  |date=February 24, 2004 |title=Tales of Gila County’s pioneer women}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Phin’s ranch in Globe, Arizona. In 1891, a Clifton newspaper mistakenly reported that Phin had been shot and killed by Ballard Peason at St. John.

On May 15, 1894, Phin Clanton was arrested by Sheriff John Henry Thompson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apcrp.org/SEE_Annie_Norran/Mast_Text_Annie_Norron_See.htm |title=See, Annie Narron |accessdate=May 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for robbing Sam Kee, a Chinese gardener in Wheatfields, at gunpoint. Kee said Phin stole a gold watch valued at $40, two bars of silver bullion, each valued at $15, one gold bracelet valued at $20 and $320 in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{findagrave|3023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clanton was acquitted on May 22, 1894.

On October 15, 1902, at age 58, Clanton married 44-year-old Laura Jane (née Neal) Bound (or Bohme) in [[Globe, Arizona]]. She had a 12-year-old son from her first marriage to William Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phineas Fay Clanton/Laura Jane Bound|url=http://freepages.family.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cpperry/html/fam/fam00199.html|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident and death==

On January 5, 1906, Phineas was involved in a wagon accident and his exposure to the cold weather led to a fatal case of [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zybtarizona.com/globe.htm |title=Globe, Arizona History |accessdate=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died at the age of 61 in Webster Springs and was buried in the Globe Cemetery.

His widow Laura Jane did wash at the mining company's guest house and took in boarders. Sixteen-year-old Will found work for a freight company driving mule teams that hauled ore from the Continental Mine to the Old Dominion. The wagon tracks are still visible in the rocks west of the Bohme Ranch on Webster Gulch. Every payday, Will bought another cow. He and Jane ran cattle on the range subsequently designated the Bohme Allotment by the U.S. Forest Service.&lt;ref name=gilatales/&gt; Four years later Laura married Phin’s friend and business associate Pete Spence.

In the [[blind tasting]], [[California wine]]s won both the red  and white wine categories. After the tasting, there were many calls for him to resign his position as Inspector General because so many people and groups were highly displeased with the results.  He is also the author of several books on French wine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5552">In [[espionage]], a '''resident spy''' is an agent operating within a foreign country for extended periods of time. A base of operations within a foreign country with which a resident spy may liaise is known as a "station" in English and a '''''&lt;span lang=ru-Latn&gt;rezidentura&lt;/span&gt;''''' (residency) in Russian parlance.{{sfn|Meier|2010|p=147}}{{sfn|Shulsky|Schmitt|2002|p=182}} What the U.S. would call a "[[station chief]]", the head spy, is known as a '''''rezident''''' in Russian.{{sfn|Meier|2010|p=147}}

== Types of resident spies ==
In the former [[Soviet Union]] and Russian nomenclature, there are two types of resident spies: ''{{lang|ru-Latn|legal'nye rezidenty}}'' ({{lang|ru|легальные резиденты}}, legal resident spy) and ''{{lang|ru-Latn|nelegal'nye rezidenty}}'' ({{lang|ru|нелегальные резиденты}}, illegal resident spy).{{sfn|Meier|2010|p=147}} In U.S. parlance, the same distinction is between "[[official cover]]" and "[[non-official cover]]".{{sfn|Shulsky|Schmitt|2002|p=12}}

A legal resident spy operates in a foreign country under official cover (such as from his country's embassy). He is an official member of the consular staff, such as a commercial, cultural, or military attaché. Thus, he has [[diplomatic immunity]] from prosecution and cannot be arrested by the host country if suspected of [[espionage]]. The most the host country can do is send him back to his home country as ''[[persona non grata]]''.{{sfn|Shulsky|Schmitt|2002|p=12}}

An illegal resident spy operates under non-official cover and so they cannot claim immunity from prosecution when arrested. They may operate under a false name and have documents making them out to be an actual national or from a different country from the one for which they are spying.{{sfn|Meier|2010|p=147}} Examples of such illegals include [[Rudolf Abel]], who operated in the United States, and [[Gordon Lonsdale]], who was born in Russia, claimed to be Canadian, and operated in Britain. Famous Soviet "illegals" include [[Richard Sorge]],{{sfn|Shulsky|Schmitt|2002|p=14}} [[Walter Krivitsky]], [[Alexander Ulanovsky]], and [[Anna Chapman]], who was also known as a [[sleeper agent]].

== Comparison of illegal and legal resident spies ==
The advantages and disadvantages of legal resident spies mostly mirror the disadvantages and advantages of illegal resident spies.{{sfn|Shulsky|Schmitt|2002|p=13}} A legal resident spy has the advantage of diplomatic status, but the disadvantage of being a known foreigner to the host country and one of just a few official diplomatic staff, whose intelligence status is thus easy for counterintelligence agencies to discern. On the other hand, an illegal resident spy has the advantage of being unknown as a foreigner to the host country and one amongst millions of the country's ordinary citizens but the disadvantage of not having diplomatic immunity to fall back upon.

A legal resident spy has opportunities to meet high-level personnel of the host country as part of "official" business, and an illegal resident spy does not. However, conversely, illegal resident spies have easier access to a wide range of potential sources who would be put off by having to approach and deal with an openly foreign official and indeed need not even reveal to those people what country the spy actually works for.{{sfn|Shulsky|Schmitt|2002|p=12–13}}

Also, an illegal resident spy can stay in the host country when diplomatic relations break down, whereas legal resident spies are forced to leave with the diplomatic mission. A legal resident spy is easier to pay, since the salary can be openly incorporated into the diplomatic payroll, whereas making arrangements to pay illegal resident spies can be difficult, sometimes involving ruses that are more expensive and complex to administer than paying a diplomatic official would be, such as paying a host country organization or corporation to allow the illegal resident spy to pose as a member of its staff and be nominally paid by that organization/corporation.{{sfn|Shulsky|Schmitt|2002|p=12–13}}

A legal resident spy has full and aboveboard access to embassy facilities for secure communications, meetings, and other services. An illegal resident spy has little to no access to such facilities, and communications arrangements are thus more difficult and time-consuming. An illegal resident spy will usually have a falsified biography, whereas a legal resident spy may suffer from having an official biography documenting their diplomatic career and providing useful clues to counterintelligence services about their intelligence activities and connections.{{sfn|Shulsky|Schmitt|2002|p=12–13}}

'''Rivka Oxman''' ({{lang-he|רבקה אוקסמן}}) is an Israeli [[architect]], researcher, and professor at the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|Technion Institute]] in [[Haifa]]. Her research interests are related to design and computation, including [[digital architecture]] and methods, and exploring their contribution to the emergence of new paradigms of architectural design and practice.

==Life and career==
Oxman graduated from the [[Hebrew Reali School]] in Haifa in 1966. She received graduate and undergraduate degrees from the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]], where she later became a professor and Vice Dean for Teaching at the Faculty of Architecture and [[Town Planning]]. She has been a Visiting Professor at [[Stanford University]] and [[Delft University of Technology]] and held research appointments at [[MIT]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]]. She has worked at the [[University of Sydney]] and [[Kaiserslautern University of Technology|Kaiserslautern University]]. 

She married fellow architect Robert Oxman, and they have two daughters, [[Neri Oxman|Neri]] and [[Keren Oxman|Keren]]. 

In 2006 she became a Fellow of DRS - the [[Design Research Society]] for her work in [[design research]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designresearchsociety.org/joomla/index.php/about/fellows.html List of DRS Fellows]&lt;/ref&gt; She is an Associate Editor of ''Design Studies,''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaleditorialboard.cws_home/30409/editorialboard Design Studies Editorial Board]&lt;/ref&gt; and on the editorial board of other journals on design theory and on digital design.  In 2010 she and her husband co-edited a special issue of the journal [[Architectural Design]] on “New Structuralism"&lt;ref&gt;Wiley Publications, {{ISBN|978-0-470-74227-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; – the convergence of new design, engineering and erchitectural technology to a new mode of synthesizing materials and creating space.  

In 2014 they edited the book Theories of the Digital in Architecture (2014), an overview of the field with chapters from dozens of contributors.

Vishniac was a versatile photographer, an accomplished [[biology|biologist]], an art collector and teacher of [[History of art|art history]]. He also made significant scientific contributions to [[Micrograph|photomicroscopy]] and [[time-lapse photography]]. Vishniac was very interested in history, especially that of his ancestors, and strongly attached to his Jewish roots; he was a [[Zionism|Zionist]] later in life.&lt;ref name=roman&gt;ICP Library of Photographers. ''Roman Vishniac''. Grossman Publishers, New York. 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman Vishniac won international acclaim for his photos of ''[[shtetl]]ach'' and Jewish ghettos, celebrity portraits, and microscopic biology. His book ''A Vanished World'', published in 1983, made him famous and is one of the most detailed pictorial documentations of Jewish culture in Eastern Europe in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=alana/&gt; Vishniac was also remembered for his humanism and respect for life, sentiments that can be seen in all aspects of his work.

In August 2014, the [[International Center for Photography]] in New York City announced that 9,000 of Vishniac's photos, many never printed or published before, would be posted in an online database.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/us-archive-pre-holocaust-photos-public-011343621.html "Archive of pre-Holocaust Photos to be Made Public", Associated Press via Yahoo News (August 27, 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Vishniac was born in his grandparents' ''[[dacha]]'' outside [[Saint Petersburg]], in the town of [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg|Pavlovsk]], and grew up in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name=bionote&gt;Kohn, Mara Vishniac, Biographical Note (1992). ''To Give them Light: The Legacy of Roman Vishniac''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993. {{ISBN|0-671-63872-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To live in this city was [[History of the Jews in Russia#Pogroms|a right granted to few Jews]] but the Vishniac family lived there because Solomon Vishniac, Roman's father, was a wealthy manufacturer of umbrellas, and his mother, Manya&lt;!-- Alexandroff--&gt;, was the daughter of affluent diamond dealers.  Vishniac also had a sister, Katja.&lt;ref name=berlin&gt;Jüdisches Museum Berlin (2005). ''Roman Vishniac's Berlin''. Editors: Mara Vishniac Kohn, James Howard Fraser and Aubrey Pomerance. Published by Nicolaische Verlagsbuchhandlung.&lt;/ref&gt; During the summer months, the Vishniac family left Moscow, as it became uncomfortably hot, and they retreated to a ''dacha'' a few miles outside the city.

As a child, Vishniac was fascinated by [[biology]] and [[photography]], and his room was filled with "plants, insects, fish and small animals".&lt;ref name=concern&gt;Vishniac, Roman. ''The Concerns of Roman Vishhniac: Man, Nature and Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; On his seventh birthday, he got a [[microscope]] from his grandmother, to which he promptly hooked up a camera, and by which he photographed the muscles in a [[cockroach]]'s leg at 150 times magnification. Young Vishniac used this microscope extensively, viewing and photographing everything he could find, from dead insects to animal [[scale (zoology)|scales]], to [[pollen]] and [[protozoa]].&lt;ref name=roman /&gt;

Until the age of ten, Vishniac was [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]]; from ten to seventeen, he attended a private school at which he earned a gold medal for scholarship.&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;"Roman Vishniac". ''Current Biography'' (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1914, he spent six years at Shanyavsky Institute (now [[Russian State University for the Humanities]]) in Moscow. At the Institute he studied [[zoology]].&lt;ref name=concern /&gt; As a graduate student, he worked with prestigious biologist [[Nikolai Koltzoff]], experimenting with inducing [[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]] in [[axolotl]], a species of aquatic [[salamander]]. While his experiments were a success, Vishniac was not able to publish a paper detailing his findings due to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|chaos in Russia]] and his results were eventually independently duplicated. In spite of this, he went on to take a three-year course in [[medicine]].&lt;ref name=roman /&gt;

=== Berlin ===
In 1918, Vishniac's immediate family moved to [[Berlin]] because of [[anti-Semitism]] spurred by [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks|uprisings against the Bolsheviks]]. Roman followed them and, shortly after arriving, married Luta (Leah) Bagg, who gave birth to two children, Mara and [[Wolf V. Vishniac|Wolf]].&lt;ref name=family&gt;Kohn, Mara Vishniac. [http://www.hias.org/WhoWeAre/120stories/59vishniac.pdf A Photographer of a Vanished World and his Family]. [[Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society|HIAS]]. Accessed January 1, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225141715/http://www.hias.org/WhoWeAre/120stories/59vishniac.pdf |date=February 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his free time, he studied [[Eastern art history|Far Eastern Art]] at the [[University of Berlin]]&lt;!--Maybe completed doctoral studied and not given degree, but Mara denies this--&gt;. Vishniac researched [[endocrinology]] and [[optics]], and did some photography (''see right''). In Berlin, he also initiated his [[public speaking]] career by joining the [[Salamander Club]], at which he often gave lectures on [[naturalism (art)|naturalism]].&lt;ref name=roman /&gt;

In 1935, as [[Nazism#German nationalism and antisemitism|anti-Semitism was growing in Germany]], Vishniac was commissioned by the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]] (JDC) in Central Europe to photograph Jewish communities in Eastern Europe as part of a fund-raising drive to help support these poor communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/?content=20120503] ''Voices on Antisemitism'' Interview with Maya Benton from the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612054230/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/?content=20120503 |date=June 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishniac developed and printed these pictures in his dark room in his Berlin apartment. Further trips to Eastern Europe were undertaken between 1935 and 1938, again at the behest of the JDC.&lt;ref name=alana/&gt; Vishniac used both a [[Leica Camera|Leica]] and a [[Rolleiflex]] camera in his photography. In 1939, his wife and children moved to [[Sweden]] to stay with Luta's parents, away from hostile Germany. He met his parents in [[Nice]] that summer.&lt;ref name=roman /&gt;

Vishniac traveled to [[Paris]] in late summer 1940, and was arrested by [[Philippe Pétain|Marshal Pétain]]'s police and interned at [[Camp du Ruchard]], a [[deportation|deportation camp]] in [[Indre-et-Loire]]. This occurred because [[Latvia]], of which he was a citizen, had been subsumed into the [[Soviet Union]] and Vishniac was considered a "stateless person". After three months, as a result of his wife's efforts and aid from the JDC, he obtained a [[Visa (document)|visa]] that allowed him to escape via [[Lisbon]] to the U.S. with his family. His father stayed behind and spent the war hidden in France; his mother died from cancer in 1941 while still in Nice.&lt;ref name=roman /&gt;&lt;ref name=berlin /&gt;&lt;ref name=jewish&gt;Jewish Museum Berlin (2005).

[[Image:EinsteinVishniac.jpg|thumb|upright|1942 portrait of [[Albert Einstein]] by Roman Vishniac. This is one of the best-known examples of his 1940's portraiture work. Taken in Princeton, NJ.]]

The Vishniac family fled from [[Lisbon]] to [[New York City]] in 1940,&lt;ref name=bionote /&gt; arriving on [[New Year's Eve]]. Vishniac tried to get a job but failed: "For me, it was a time of distraction and fear."&lt;ref name=roman /&gt; He was [[multilingual]], speaking at least [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Yiddish]], but he could not yet speak any [[English language|English]] and thus had a difficult time.&lt;ref name=weiner&gt;Weiner, Jonathan (circa 1981). "Field of Vision". ''[[Moment (magazine)|Moment]]''. pg 37.&lt;/ref&gt; He managed to do some portraiture work with mostly foreign clients; but business was poor. It was during this time, in 1942, that he took one of his most celebrated portraits, that of [[Albert Einstein]]. He arrived at Einstein's home in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], getting into the scientist's study with the ruse of bringing regards from mutual friends in Europe, and photographed him while the scientist was not paying attention to him, occupied in thought. Einstein later called this portrait his favourite.

In 1946, Vishniac divorced Luta, and the next year he married Edith Ernst, an old family friend. A few years later, he gave up portraiture and went on to do freelance work in the field of [[Micrograph|photomicroscopy]].&lt;ref name=roman /&gt;

Once in the United States, Vishniac tried desperately to earn sympathy for impoverished Jews in [[Eastern Europe]]. When his work was exhibited at [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] in 1943,&lt;ref name=misery&gt;"Studies in Misery Shown". ''New York Times'' 2 February 1943; ProQuest Historical Newspapers pg. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote to [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] ([[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] at the time), asking her to visit the exhibit, but she did not. He also sent some of his photographs to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|the President]], for which he was politely thanked.&lt;ref name=children&gt;Edited by Kohn, Mara Vishniac and Flacks, Miriam Hartman.

Even when he grew older, Vishniac was very active. In 1957, he was appointed research associate at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] and in 1961 was promoted to "professor of biological education".&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia (2003).

[[Image:Vishniac reading.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Vishniac, c. 1981 by Daniel J. Krellenstein.]]

During his life, Vishniac was the subject and creator of many [[film]]s and [[documentary film|documentaries]]; the most celebrated of which was the Living Biology series.

=== In Central and Eastern Europe ===

==== 1935–1939 ====
Vishniac is best known for his dramatic photographs of poor and pious [[Jew]]s in cities and ''[[shtetl]]ach'' of [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref name="alana"/&gt; He was commissioned to take these pictures by the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]] (JDC) as part of a fundraising initiative, but Vishniac had a personal interest in this subject matter.

C1.&lt;/ref&gt; During his touring of Eastern Europe (1935–1939), he was often arrested by police for taking these pictures, sometimes because he was thought to be spying.&lt;!--(Jews were not allowed to take pictures or even carry cameras).--&gt;&lt;ref name=UCSB /&gt; Later, when published, these photographs made him popular enough for his work to be showcased as one-man shows at [[Columbia University]], the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum in New York]], the [[International Center of Photography]] and other such institutions.

Vishniac claimed that he had taken 16,000 photos in this period, every one a candid shot,&lt;ref name=weiner /&gt; but the veracity of these claims has been challenged by research by Maya Benton, a curator at the International Center of Photography.&lt;ref name="alana"/&gt;&lt;ref name=polish&gt;Roman Vishniac.

When using a Leica for indoor shots, Vishniac sometimes brought a [[kerosene lamp]] (visible in some of his work) if there was insufficient light, keeping his back to a wall for support, and holding his breath.&lt;ref name=weiner /&gt; The Rolleiflex was used mostly for outdoor scenes.

Roman Vishniac did not just want to preserve the memories of the Jews; he actively fought to increase awareness in the West of the worsening situation in Eastern Europe. "Through his photographs, he sought to alert the rest of the world to the horrors [of the Nazi persecution]", Mitgang.&lt;ref name=mitgang /&gt; In late 1938, for example, he sneaked into [[Zbaszyn]], an [[internment camp]] in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] near the border, where Jews awaited deportment to [[Poland]].

These photos were sent to the [[League of Nations]] in Geneva to prove the existence such camps.&lt;ref name=mitgang /&gt;

After Vishniac's death, many photos came to light depicting life in Berlin taken between 1920 and 1939. Some of these negatives were found at the end of rolls of film devoted to scientific work. An exhibition of Vishniac's Berlin photos was mounted at the [[Jewish Museum, Berlin]] in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.jmberlin.de/main/EN/01-Exhibitions/02-Special-Exhibitions/2005/vishniac.php| title = Roman Vishniac's Berlin| accessdate = February 14, 2012| publisher = Jewish Museum Berlin| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141222205243/http://www.jmberlin.de/main/EN/01-Exhibitions/02-Special-Exhibitions/2005/vishniac.php| archivedate = December 22, 2014| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a book of the photos was published.

==== Style ====
Vishniac's photographs from the 1930s are all of a very distinct style; they are all focused on achieving the same end: capturing the unique culture of Jewish ghettos in Eastern Europe, especially the religious and impoverished.&lt;ref name="alana"/&gt; His published pictures largely center on these people, usually in small groups, going about their daily lives: very often studying (generally religious texts), walking (many times through harsh weather), and sometimes just sitting; staring. The scenes are dramatic: "There is barely a hint of a smile on any of the faces. The eyes peer at us suspiciously from behind ancient [[casement window]]s and over a peddler's tray, from crowded schoolrooms and desolate street corners."&lt;ref name=fenyvesi&gt;Fenyvesi, Charles. "A vanished world". ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]],'' Jan 1984 v14 p130(2). Accessed January 3, 2006, from InfoTrac Web: OneFile A3071101.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Thornton]], writer for ''[[The New York Times]]'', called them "somber with poverty and with the gray light of European Winter".&lt;ref name=thornton&gt;Thornton, Gene.

These pictures, all in black and white, were done with available light or sometimes a lantern,&lt;ref name=weiner /&gt; yet they are "amazingly crisp with surprising depth of field".&lt;ref name=keppler&gt;[[Herbert Keppler|Keppler, Herbert]]. "A vanished world". [[Modern Photography]], Sept 1984 v48 p92(1). Accessed January 3, 2006, from InfoTrac Web: OneFile A3409487&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, "There is a grainy realism to Vishniac's photographic style. We can almost finger the coarse textures of coats and shawls; the layers of fabric worn by the people seem more related to tree bark than to the well-pressed wool suit worn by an occasional elegant passerby."&lt;ref name=fenyvesi /&gt; Vishniac is known to have exaggerated in composing the captions of his photographs, and in some cases he may have fabricated the stories behind them.&lt;ref name="alana"/&gt;

==== Impact ====
Vishniac's photographs from this period are widely commended and on permanent display in many museums. [[Edward Steichen]] places his pre-[[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] photographs, "among photography's finest documents of a time and place."'&lt;ref name=schumach /&gt;

Vishniac's photographs have had a profound effect on Holocaust literature and have illustrated [[#Publications|many books]] about the Jewish ghettos and Holocaust. In the case of ''The Only Flowers of her Youth'', the drama of the photograph inspired [[Miriam Nerlove]] to write a novel based on the story of the girl in the picture.&lt;ref&gt;All Readers.com (2005). [http://www.allreaders.com/Topics/Info_22255.asp Review Summary of ''Flowers on the Wall'']. Accessed February 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

For this work, Roman Vishniac has received the Memorial Award of the [[American Society of Media Photographers|American Society of Magazine Photographers]] in 1956. He was also the winner of the [[visual arts]] category of awards of the [[Jewish Book Council]] in 1984; ''The Only Flowers of her Youth'' was deemed "most impressive" at the [[Singapore International Salon of Photography|International Photographic Exhibition]] in [[Lucerne]] in 1952; and the Grand Prize for Art in Photography, [[New York Coliseum]].&lt;ref name=roman /&gt;&lt;ref name="concern" /&gt;

In 1955 [[Edward Steichen]] selected three of Vishniac's Eastern European photographs; of boys at a [[Cheder]] in [[Slonim]] (1938), of children and a woman in [[Lublin]] (1937), for the [[Museum of Modern Art]] world-touring [[The Family of Man]] exhibition that was seen by 9 million visitors, accompanied by a catalogue which has never been out of print.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1=Steichen, Edward | author2=Steichen, Edward, 1879-1973, (organizer.) | author3=Sandburg, Carl, 1878-1967, (writer of foreword.) | author4=Norman, Dorothy, 1905-1997, (writer of added text.) | author5=Lionni, Leo, 1910-1999, (book designer.) | author6=Mason, Jerry, (editor.) | author7=Stoller, Ezra, (photographer.) | author8=Museum of Modern Art (New York, N.Y.) | title=The family of man : the photographic exhibition | publication-date=1955 | publisher=Published for the Museum of Modern Art by Simon and Schuster in collaboration with the Maco Magazine Corporation | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10809600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criticism ====
There has been criticism of Vishniac's work, focusing on the lack of diversity of his subjects in his work from Eastern Europe and quality of his composition. It has been argued that he should have also photographed wealthier Jews, in addition to the poor Jews in ghettos. Thornton criticized his photographs for their unprofessional qualities, citing "errors of focus and accidents of design, as when an unexplained third leg and foot protrudes from the long coat of a hurrying scholar."&lt;ref name="thornton" /&gt;

When photographic curator Maya Benton began to catalog Vishniac's negatives for the archive of the [[International Center of Photography]], she noticed that, in his book ''A Vanished World'', Vishniac juxtaposed photos to tell stories, and wrote captions that were not supported by the material. In the final spread of the book, for example, there is a photo of a man peering through a metal door; on the opposite page a small boy points with his finger to his eye. Vishiniac's caption reads: "The father is hiding from the Endecy (members of the National Democratic Party). His son signals him that they are approaching. Warsaw, 1935-1938." At the front of the book, additional commentary reads: "The pogromshchiki" (pogrom lynch mob) "are coming. But the iron door was no protection." Benton's research found that the photos were from different rolls of film, taken in different towns, so the scene described in the book "almost certainly did not happen".&lt;ref name="alana" /&gt;

Similarly, Benton discovered negatives that showed the unsmiling little girl depicted in ''The Only Flowers of her Youth'' &amp;ndash; whom Vishniac had claimed did not own a pair of shoes &amp;ndash; smiling and wearing shoes.&lt;ref name=alana/&gt;

Michael di Capua, who edited Vishniac's text for ''A Vanished World'', has said that he felt disquiet while compiling the text, since so much information was unsubstantiated.&lt;ref name=alana/&gt; Benton also suggested that the terms of Vishniac's commission from the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee|JDC]] &amp;ndash; to photograph "not the fullness of Eastern European Jewish life but its most needy, vulnerable corners for a fund-raising project" &amp;ndash; had led to his over-emphasizing poor, religious communities in ''A Vanished World''.&lt;ref name=alana/&gt;

=== Photomicroscopy and biology ===
[[Image:VishniacFirefly.gif|thumb|Vishniac's daughter Mara, through the eye of a [[firefly]]: an achievement in photography and biology]]

In addition to the candid photography for which he is best known, Vishniac worked heavily in the field of [[Micrograph|photomicroscopy]], (specifically [[interference microscopy]] and [[cinemicroscopy]]). He specialized in photographing living insects and had a talent for arranging the moving specimens in "just the right poses", according to [[Philippe Halsman]], former president of the [[American Society of Magazine Photographers]]. On the subject of Vishniac's skill in photomicroscopy, Halsman said he was, "a special kind of genius".&lt;ref name=roman /&gt; He worked with all sorts of specimens, from [[protozoa]], to [[firefly|fireflies]] to [[amino acid]]s. Vishniac's work in photomicroscopy was, and is, highly regarded in the field. For three consecutive years, beginning in 1952, he won the Best-of-the-Show Award of the [[Biological Photographic Association]] in New York.&lt;ref name=roman /&gt;

One of Roman Vishniac's most famous endeavors in the field of photomicroscopy was his revolutionary photographs from the inside of a firefly's eye, behind 4,600 tiny [[ommatidia]], complexly arranged. In addition, there were the images taken at the medical school of [[Boston University]] of the circulating blood inside a [[hamster]]'s cheek pouch. Vishniac invented new methods for light-interruption photography and color photomicroscopy.&lt;ref name=columbia /&gt; His method of colorization, (developed in the 1960s and early 1970s) uses [[polarized light]] to penetrate certain formations of [[Cell complex|cell structure]] and may greatly improve the detail of an image.&lt;ref name=roman /&gt;

In the field of biology, Vishniac specialized in [[marine microbiology]], the [[physiology]] of [[ciliate]]s, [[circulatory system]]s in [[unicellular plant]]s and [[endocrinology]] (from his work in Berlin) and metamorphosis.&lt;ref name=columbia /&gt; Despite his aptitude and accomplishments in the field, most of his work in biology was secondary to his photography: Vishniac studied the [[anatomy]] of an organism primarily to better photograph it. Besides experimenting with the metamorphosis of [[axolotl]], he also researched the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of [[chromosome]]s in 1920: both in Berlin. As a biologist and philosopher in 1950, he hypothesized [[polyphyletic origin]], a theory that life arose from multiple, independent [[biochemistry|biochemical]] reactions, spawning multicellular life. As a philosopher, he "developed principles of [[rationalistic philosophy]]" in the '50s.&lt;ref name=roman /&gt;

=== Other photography ===
Vishniac is notable for his photographs of insects mating, [[European seabass|sea bass]] feasting and other living creatures in full animation. Skillfully and patiently, he would stalk insects or other such creatures for hours in the suburbs around New York City. Before beginning the hunt, he would lie for over an hour in the grass, rubbing himself with proximate flora to make himself smell less artificial. He would then gracefully swoop close to his prey and patiently frame the scene with an [[single-lens reflex camera|SLR]] equipped with an [[extension tube]]. He had even trained himself to hold his breath for up to two minutes, so that he could take his time and not disturb slowly exposing images.&lt;ref name="roman" /&gt;

Vishniac's subjects varied throughout his life. At times, he would focus on documenting everyday life, as in Berlin, and later [[portrait painting|portraiture]], doing famous portraits of [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Marc Chagall]]. He was also a pioneer in [[time-lapse|time-lapse photography]], on which he worked from 1915 to 1918,&lt;ref name="roman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wilson" /&gt; and again later in life.

== Religion and philosophy ==
[[Image:VishniacMara.jpg|thumb|right|Vishniac's daughter, Mara, as a young girl, poses in front of a store selling devices for differentiating between [[Aryan race|Aryan]] and Non-Aryan head shapes. Berlin, 1933]]

Roman Vishniac always had strong ties with his ancestry, especially the [[Judaism|Jewish]] aspect of it, "From earliest childhood, my main interest was my ancestors". He was a [[Zionism|Zionist]]&lt;ref name=weiner /&gt;&lt;ref name=mitgang /&gt; and a strong sympathizer with Jews who had suffered because of [[anti-Semitism]], "Oh yes, I could be a professor of anti-Semitism", also stating then that he had one hundred and one relatives who died during the Holocaust. A famous photo of his (''pictured right'') of a store in Berlin selling devices for separating Jews and non-Jews by skull shape was used by him to criticize the [[pseudoscience]] of German anti-Semites.&lt;ref name=mitgang /&gt;

Vishniac associated much of his work with religion, though not specifically [[Judaism]]. "Nature, [[God]], or whatever you want to call the creator of the Universe comes through the microscope clearly and strongly," he remarked in his laboratory one day.

Living with the memory of hardship, Vishniac was, "an absolute [[optimism|optimist]] filled with tragedy. His [[humanism]] is not just for Jews, but for every living thing."&lt;ref name=schumach /&gt; He probably believed in God or some similar concept, but he was non-denominational and did not adhere strictly to the principles of any religion. He even clashed with [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] in one well-known instance: The religious Jews he met on his trek around Europe would not let themselves be photographed, quoting the [[Bible]] and its prohibition of making of [[idolatry|graven images]]. Vishniac's famous response was, "the [[Torah]] existed for thousands of years before the camera had been invented."&lt;ref name=mitgang /&gt;

Vishniac was known for having great respect for all living creatures. Whenever possible, he returned a specimen to its precise home before it was captured&lt;ref name=roman /&gt; and one time "[lent] his bathtub to [[tadpole]]s for weeks until he could return them to their pond". In accordance with this philosophy, he photographed almost exclusively living subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The saved faces of Roman Vishniac|journal=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=February 5, 1990|volume=108|issue=5|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- some really good quotes are necessary here: 'just because they're small doesn't mean they don't deserve respect'; 'how would you like to be taken away from your house. he puts them in exact pond'--&gt;

{{Contains Arabic text}}
A '''Ṣa‘īdi''' ({{Lang-arz|صعيدى}}) is a Southern person from [[Upper Egypt]] ({{Lang-ar|صعيد مصر}} ''Ṣa‘īd'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Abu-Lughod | first = Lila | authorlink = Lila Abu-Lughod | title = Local Contexts of Islamism in Popular Media | publisher = [[University of Amsterdam|Amsterdam University Press]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 90-5356-824-7 | page = 24 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 40% of Egyptians live in Upper Egypt, and ''"80% of Egypt's poverty is concentrated in Upper Egypt"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Young People in Upper Egypt: New Voices, New Perspectives|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/09/06/young-people-in-upper-egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millions of upper Egyptians have migrated to Lower Egypt for work opportunities. The Sa'idi people are traditionally [[rural]].

== Etymology ==
The word literally means "from Ṣa‘īd" (i.e. Upper Egypt), and can also refer to a [[Music of Egypt#Saidi (Upper Egyptian)|form of music]] originating there,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Zuhur | first = Sherifa | title = Colors of Enchantment | publisher = [[American University in Cairo|American University in Cairo Press]] | year = 2001 | isbn = 977-424-607-1 | page = 456 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to [[Sa'idi Arabic|the dialect]] spoken by Sa'idis. The Arabic word ''Ṣa‘īd'', as a geographical term, means "highland, upland, plateau".&lt;ref&gt;Wehr, Hans, 1979. ''A Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic''. Ithaca: Spoken Language Services Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[suffix]] "-i" denotes the adjective. The word ''Ṣa‘īdi'' is pronounced in the dialect itself as {{IPA-arz|sˤɑˈʕiːdi|}} or {{IPA-arz|sˤɑˈʕiːdej|}} and the plural is {{IPA-arz|sˤɑˈʕɑːjda|}} or {{IPA-arz|sˤɑˈʕɑːjde|}}, while pronounced in [[Egyptian Arabic]] (Northern Egyptian) as {{IPA-arz|sˤeˈʕiːdi|}} and the plural is {{IPA-arz|sˤɑˈʕɑjdɑ|}}.

In the Sahidic (Upper Egyptian) dialect of Coptic, the name for a person from Upper Egypt is {{Coptic|ⲣⲉⲙⲣⲏⲥ}} (pronounced rem/rīs) meaning "person of the South" or {{Coptic|ⲣⲉⲙ(ⲡ)ⲙⲁⲣⲏⲥ}} (pronounced rem/pma/rīs or rem/ma/rīs) "person of (the) place of the south (i.e. Upper Egypt)" &lt;ref&gt;WE Crum, A Coptic Dictionary, 1939, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Stereotypes and jokes ==
Ṣa‘īdis and their dialect are the subject of numerous Egyptian Stereotypes and [[ethnic jokes]] mainly by the [[Upper Class]] Egyptians who owns [[business]] in Egypt's major cities and used to hire Upper Egyptian workers in [[Construction|Construction fields]]. They are popularly assumed to be rural simpletons, physically stronger and less clever than other [[Egyptians]]. An example of such [[Ethnic stereotype|stereotyping]] is the box office hit ''Ṣa‘īdi fil-Gama‘a al-Amrikiya'' ("''A Sa'idi in the American University''", i.e. the [[American University in Cairo]]) (1998) starring [[Mohamed Henedi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|0389340|Sa'eedi fil gamaa el amrekeia}} &lt;/ref&gt;, where he seemed less fashionable, less clever than the other Egyptian students of the '''AUC'''.

== Religion in Upper Egypt ==
The majority of Upper Egyptians follow [[Sunni Islam]] though the region also has a significant Christian population and a rich [[Coptic history|Coptic Christian history]]. For instance, [[Coptic language#Sahidic|Sahidic]] was the leading Coptic dialect in the pre-Islamic period. In the last few decades the high proportion of Coptic Christians in Upper Egypt has enabled some Christians to hold prominent political posts there. For instance, [[Qena Governorate]] had a Coptic Christian governor in 2011.

'''Jon Scott Ashjian''' (born 1964), commonly known as '''Scott Ashjian''', was the candidate of the [[Tea Party of Nevada]] in the race for [[United States Senate]] in the [[United States Senate election in Nevada, 2010|2010 Nevada general election]].&lt;ref name="split"&gt;{{cite news| last =Coolican  | first = J. Patrick | title = Tea Party candidate could siphon GOP votes in bid to remove Harry Reid | work = [[Las Vegas Sun]]  | publisher =www.lasvegassun.com  | date =March 5, 2010  | url =http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/mar/05/political-newbie-could-split-gop  | accessdate = 2010-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashjian was born in [[Fresno, California]]; the oldest of eight children. After graduating from South Lake Tahoe High School in 1982, he started his own [[auto detailing]] company in [[Bakersfield, California]], and grew it to include locations in Fresno, Bakersfield, and [[Visalia, California]]. He is a [[Mormonism|Latter-day Saint]], and served on a mission for the LDS Church in [[Argentina]] from 1986 to 1988. Ashjian moved from [[California]] to [[Nevada]] in 1995. He resides in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], Nevada, where he works as a businessman, paving contractor, and [[real estate investor]], and is owner of an [[asphalt]] company. With his wife, Bonnie, he has two sons and one daughter.

Ashjian was a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and voted for the presidential candidacies of [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George W. Bush]] and [[John McCain]]. In 2010, Ashjian and his supporters created the Tea Party of Nevada, whose values espouse [[small government]], [[Free will|freedom]], [[liberty]], and decreasing the [[United States public debt]]. Ashjian filed his candidacy papers for the Tea Party, a registered [[minor party]] in [[Nevada]], at [[Carson City]] on March 2, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Election Center|title=2010 Filed Candidates|author=[[Nevada Secretary of State]]|publisher=www.nvsos.gov|url=http://nvsos.gov/index.aspx?page=337|accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashjian's U.S. Senate candidacy was challenged in court in April 2010, and [[Carson City, Nevada]] district judge James Todd Russell ruled that he could stay on the ballot. This decision was appealed, and the [[Nevada Supreme Court]] ruled in a unanimous decision on October 6, 2010 that Ashjian would remain on the November 2010 ballot for U.S. Senate.&lt;ref name="nevsupremecourt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="conservativeslose" /&gt;

In media interviews, Ashjian emphasized his values included decreased power of government, and a strict interpretation of the [[United States Constitution]]. He identified with the views of politicians including Ronald Reagan, [[Sarah Palin]], and [[Ron Paul]]. His political campaign was run as a [[grass-roots movement]], and he served as his own [[communications director]]. He explained his decision to manage a minimalist and inexpensive campaign came from a desire to avoid a disconnect between politics and the people he wished to represent. Ashjian asserted he was confident his campaign would beat opponents from the two major political parties, Democrat [[Harry Reid]] and Republican [[Sharron Angle]]. In October 2010, Ashjian released an audio-tape to the media of a recorded conversation with Angle, in which she asked him to drop out of the U.S. Senate race. Angle told him she did not believe she could beat [[U.S. Senate Majority Leader]] Harry Reid, if Ashjian remained on the ballot. Ashjian said he would stay in the race, and criticized both the major parties as inadequate choices in the election that would further the [[status quo]]. Harry Reid won the 2010 race and was reelected to the U.S. Senate.

==Early life and family==
Scott Ashjian was born in [[Fresno, California]] in 1964; the oldest of eight children.&lt;ref name="split" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Choice"&gt;{{cite news| last = Jordan| first = Kristi | title = Tea Party hopeful Ashjian gives voters third choice | work = [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]  | publisher = www.lvrj.com | date = March 8, 2010 | url =http://www.lvrj.com/news/tea-party-hopeful-ashjian-gives-voters-third-choice-86816842.html  | accessdate = 2010-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, John M.

==Political career==

Describing his political views, Ashjian stated to the ''[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'' that he espouses Tea Party views including limiting the role of government, and a strict interpretation of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="vogeladmits" /&gt; Ashjian aligns himself with the conservative views of politicians Ronald Reagan, [[Ron Paul]] and [[Sarah Palin]].&lt;ref name="thirdchoice" /&gt; He said in April 2010 that he was "100 percent sure" he would win the election and beat opponents [[Harry Reid]] and [[Sharron Angle]] in the November 2010 general election, "by a large margin".&lt;ref name="vogelruling"&gt;{{cite news| last =Vogel  | first = Ed   | title =Ruling allows Ashjian to run on Tea Party of Nevada ticket   | work = [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]  | page = 5B | date =April 16, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that he filed to run for U.S. Senate, because individuals in Nevada who identified with Tea Party values had been "duped by the Republican Party".&lt;ref name="vogelruling" /&gt; Ashjian noted, "The GOP is trying to co-opt the Tea Party. That is one of the reasons I did what I did. I don't see a difference between Democrats and Republicans."&lt;ref name="vogelruling" /&gt; Ashjian stated he did not think Sharron Angle would be able to win the U.S. Senate race against Harry Reid, and stated "Republican attack committees are running the (national) Tea Party show."&lt;ref name="vogelruling" /&gt; In May 2010 Ashjian asserted to the ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'', "I will pick up a large percentage of votes on both sides (Republican and Democrat) and those in the middle."&lt;ref name="vogelpartyannounces" /&gt;

Ashjian's political campaign was structured as a [[grass-roots movement]].&lt;ref name="thirdchoice"&gt;{{cite news| last = Jourdan | first = Kristi   | title =Tea Party hopeful – gives voters third choice   | work =[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]  | page =1B  | date = March 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The candidate served as his own [[communications director]], and relied on his family and friends for assistance.&lt;ref name="thirdchoice" /&gt; His campaign website contained the declaration, "I am running because I love my country and Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama are ruining it. It is time to take our country back and I am asking you to join me in this fight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Smith  | first = John L. | title =Critics play whack-a-mole with Tea Party of Nevada candidate   | work = [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]  | page = 1B | date = March 23, 2010   }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashjian stated in an interview with the ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'', "I'm a frustrated patriot. I'm not a politician. I'm not savvy with radio and TV. But I believe I can make a change, and that's what I'm here for. I'm here to give people a third choice."&lt;ref name="thirdchoice" /&gt; When asked to characterize the Tea Party of Nevada, Ashjian responded, "We're not Republican or Democrat. We won't fold into one party or the other. We're a tax-paying party that can make a difference and a party of normal people who want change. Bigger government and higher taxes is not working. Right now we're at a real crossroads to make change, and the bottom line is there's never been so much disdain for politicians."&lt;ref name="thirdchoice" /&gt; He explained why he chose to run a minimalist campaign, "The political race is for the rich. Why would (politicians) want to spend X millions of dollars on a campaign? It has to be for political gain. That disconnect is why I'm running for office."&lt;ref name="thirdchoice" /&gt; Ashjian asserted that results for voters would be similar with both major party candidates as opposed to a third option, "I'm here to say there is a choice. If you want to stick to the status quo, pick the Republicans or Democrats, but don't complain. Nobody can do a better job than I can."&lt;ref name="thirdchoice" /&gt; Regarding overtures from the Republican Party asking Ashjian to acquiesce to the two-party-system, Ashjian said, "By them saying I should fall in line is an insult. I'm not asking for an invitation. I think they should get behind me, not fall in line like sheep. They're so paranoid, it makes me think they have weak candidates and they're afraid. The more they attack, the more they show their hand, and I mean that across party lines. It's not politics as usual. We're running a different campaign, and they're scared to death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Jourdan | first =Kristi  | title =Tea Party activists say candidate uninvited   | work = [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]  | page = 1B | date = March 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, Ashjian released a tape to the media of a recorded conversation he had with Sharron Angle where she asked him to drop out of the race.&lt;ref name="toeplitz" /&gt; In the tape, Angle says that she cannot defeat Harry Reid with Ashjian on the ballot.&lt;ref name="toeplitz"&gt;{{cite news|last=Toeplitz|first=Shira|title=Sharron Angle caught on tape with third-party candidate|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1010/43085.html|newspaper=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|date=October 4, 2010|accessdate=2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashjian commented about the meeting, in an interview with the ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'', "She asked that I support her, and I said, 'Why would I go and do that?'".&lt;ref name="notleaving" /&gt; He stated he would never entertain the notion of dropping out of the race, "She said, 'I can't win without you getting out of the race.' But I said I couldn't. I'm going to beat Harry Reid."&lt;ref name="notleaving"&gt;{{cite news| last = Myers | first = Laura   | title = Ashjian not leaving race  | work = [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] | page = 1B | date = October 1, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized that he would not drop out of the race, "I call the shots. ... I fought too hard to be on the ballot to get off."&lt;ref name="notleaving" /&gt; Ashjian remarked of the pressure involved in running for office, "I've had personal threats against me and my family. I've had my phone tapped, and I've been followed."&lt;ref name="notleaving" /&gt; He commented that Angle was too close with the Republican Party, and therefore not a true outsider candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Myers | first = Laura   | title = Key supporter denounces Ashjian  | work =[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|page=1B | date = October 6, 2010   }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashjian sent a letter to Nevada Secretary of State Ross Miller in October 2010, asking that party abbreviations on ballots be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Vogel | first =Ed | title = Candidate Ashjian opposes party's ballot abbreviation  | work = [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]  | page = 3B | date = October 12, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 2010, a second ruling by the [[Nevada Supreme Court]] again affirmed Ashjian's ability to stand as a candidate in the 2010 Nevada election for U.S. Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=October 28, 2010|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|title=Nevada Supreme Court rules Scott Ashjian ballot appeal moot|last=Ryan|first=Cy|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/oct/28/scott-ashjian-ballot-ap/|accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case, the office of the Secretary of State of Nevada had asserted that the effort to appeal the case to the Nevada Supreme Court was without merit, because voters had already received absentee ballots and a removal of the candidate's entry would have the impact of therefore disenfranchising voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Nevada Appeal]]|title=High court dismisses Ashjian ballot appeal|date=October 29, 2010|url=http://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20101029/NEWS/101029603/1001&amp;parentprofile=1058|accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its [[unanimous]] decision, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled, "(The) appellant's unexplained delay in prosecuting this appeal militates against disrupting the election process, which is already underway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Effort to get Ashjian off ballot goes nowhere|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|date=October 29, 2010|last=McMurdo|first=Doug|url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/effort-to-get-ashjian-off-ballot-goes-nowhere-106287443.html?ref=443|accessdate=2010-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; One day before the U.S. Senate election, Ashjian received three percent in a survey from [[Public Policy Polling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Talking Points Memo]]|title=PPP Poll: Neck And Neck In Nevada Senate Race|last=Kleefeld|first=Eric|date=November 1, 2010|publisher=TPM Media LLC|url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/11/ppp-poll-neck-and-neck-in-nevada-senate-race.php|accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Reid won the race, and was reelected to the U.S. Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Senate: Reid retains seat|work=[[Nevada Appeal]]|last=Blood|first=Michael R.

==Biography==
Serhiy Nigoyan was born on August 2, 1993 to ethnic Armenians in [[:uk:Березнуватівка|Bereznuvativka]] village (south of [[Dnipropetrovsk]]) in [[Ukraine]]. Serhiy Nigoyan's parents are from the village [[Navur]], in Armenia's northeastern province of [[Tavush Province|Tavush]], not far from the Azerbaijani border. They moved to Ukraine in the early 1990s, during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] when their village was often attacked. Some relatives of Serhiy's father Gagik still live in Navur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sargsyan|first=Voskan|script-title=hy:Կիեւում բախումների ժամանակ զոհված Սերգեյ Նիգոյանի ընտանիքը Ուկրաինա էր տեղափոխվել Նավուրից|url=http://www.aravot.am/2014/01/22/424691/|accessdate=25 January 2014|newspaper=[[Aravot]]|date=22 January 2014|language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=I will stay in Maidan till the end: killed Nigoian told his father|url=http://nyut.am/archives/120690?lang=en|accessdate=25 January 2014|newspaper=[[NYUT.AM]]|date=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maidan-Kyiv-6767-Nigoian-Sergiy.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Serhiy Nigoyan on the barricade Myhailivska street, December 11, 2013.]]
He died early in the morning of January 22, 2014 at around 06.30&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbnews.com.ua/ua/news/111150/ At Hrushevskoho Berkut shot protester, another died in hospital]. nbnews. January 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; after being mortally wounded. Soon after, at around 08.10, [[Berkut (Ukraine)|Berkut]] violently charged protesters&lt;ref&gt;[http://tsn.ua/video/video-novini/video-rankovoyi-ataki-berkutu-na-demonstrantiv.html Video of morning attack of Berkut against protesters]. TSN. January 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; on Hrushevskoho street, near the [[Lobanovsky Dynamo Stadium]].

On January 23, [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Ukraine)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] of Ukraine issued a statement stating that death of two activists (Nigoyan, and Belorussian [[Mikhail Zhyznewsky]]) resulted from wounds inflicted by a firearm using a lead case shot, and a hunting rifle. The Ministry claimed that such firearms are not in use by the Ukrainian police, and, moreover, that officers dispersing the protest were not issued with any standard firearms either. The ministry also noted presence of many protesters with firearms in videos made at the area. One of estimated reasons was provocation for conflict escalation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mvs.gov.ua/mvs/control/main/uk/publish/article/965163]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 23, 2014 the Televised News Service (TSN) showed a footage with interview of Nigoyan filmed on January 19 by the TSN's cameraman. On a question why he came to Euromaidan, Nigoyan stated that he did so in protest against beating of students by Berkut militsiya. While proud to be an [[Armenians|Armenian]], Nigoyan wanted to express his support for people among which he was born and with which he lived.

On January 26, 2014 Nigoyan was buried in his native village Bereznuvativka.&lt;ref name=nigoyan_funeral&gt;[http://news.am/arm/news/191140.html Serhiy Nigoyan was buried in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]. news.fm. January 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral was attended by local villagers, representative of the [[Armenian diaspora]], priests from Armenian and Ukrainian Churches.&lt;ref name=nigoyan_funeral/&gt; His requiem was served by the head of Ukrainian Eparchy of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] Archbishop Grigoris Buniatyan.&lt;ref name=nigoyan_funeral/&gt;

On January 22, 2015 the General Prosecutor of Ukraine Vitaly Yarema claimed that smoothbore guns were used for murder, but there are documented facts police used hunting ammo to kill those (Nigoyan and Zhiznevsky) heroes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://obozrevatel.com/crime/37842-pervyie-geroi-nebesnoj-sotni-byili-ubityi-iz-gladkostvolnogo-oruzhiya-genprokuror.htm/ The first heroes of Heavenly Hundred were killed by smoothbore gun - General Prosecutor of Ukraine]. Obozrevatel website. January 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 2015 according to the head of the Special Investigations Unit of the Main Investigation Department of the Prosecutor General Sergei Gorbatyuk, Serhiy Nigoyan and Mikhail Zhiznevsky were killed at a distance of not less than three meters, while the law enforcement agencies of the protesters were at a distance of about 30 meters. The killers could be provocateurs or masked police workers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://obozrevatel.com/crime/29501-gpu-vyiyasnila-kto-ubil-nigoyana-i-zhiznevskogo.htm/ GPU found out who killed Nigoyan, Zhiznevsky and Senyk]. Obozrevatel website. November 18, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

His friends{{which|date=March 2017}} from Maidan suppose he was chosen for murder because of his appearance, activity, and popularity among the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kp.ua/politics/487182-ubyistvo-nyhoiana-ny-ulyk-ny-svydetelei/ It is almost impossible to solve the murder of the first victim on Maidan]. Komsomolskaya Pravda in Ukraine. January 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2017 The General Procuror Office of Ukraine stated that the murder of Nigoyan and Zhiznevsky was not properly investigated and is considered to be unfinished. The victims could have been shot from distance of no less than 30 meters and may include some law enforcement officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2017/01/26/7133537/ The first kills at Maidan: GPU reviews "enforcers" (Перші вбивства на Майдані: ГПУ розглядає силовиків)].

[[Valentyn Sylvestrov]] (b. 1937), a renowned Ukrainian composer, dedicated a memorial diptych to Serhiy Nigoyan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10471">The '''Splat Pack''' is a collection of [[independent filmmakers]] who, since 2002, have directed, written and produced numerous R-rated [[horror film]]s, notable for their [[Low-budget film|low budgets]] and extreme ultra-violence.&lt;ref name="the splat pack"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Splat Pack |first=Rebecca |last=Winters Keegan |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1549299,00.html |newspaper= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= October 22, 2006|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term was coined by [[Alan Jones (film critic)|Alan Jones]] of ''[[Total Film]]''.&lt;ref name="blood brothers"&gt;{{cite news |title=Blood Brothers  |first=Alan |last=Jones |authorlink=Alan Jones (film critic) |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117956275.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;s=h&amp;p=0 |newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=December 24, 2006 |accessdate=January 7, 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The group has been credited with bringing back ultra-violent movies, as well as moving away from [[MPAA film rating system|PG-13]] rated movies and into the [[MPAA film rating system|R-rated]] spectrum, all while operating with [[independent film|low budgets]].&lt;ref name="the splat pack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="horrors"&gt;''New York Post''; October 22, 2006.

A '''stable master''' or '''head groom''' is the [[Management|manager]] in charge of a [[stable]].

At large [[horse]] establishments there may be several [[groom (horses)|groom]]s under the management of the stable master.  

In a professional establishment the head groom usually has complete responsibility for the horses including devising training schedules, choosing feeds for optimum [[nutrition]] and ensuring the horses are shod, wormed, inoculated and provided with timely [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] care.

In a [[great house|private residence]] the stable master has these responsibilities and must also accommodate the riding schedules of the employer’s family and, if necessary, arrange for lessons and training. The stable master must insure that a groom is on call during specified hours in case any members of the employer’s family wish to ride. The stable master is also responsible for the special needs of aged and retired horses, and usually for the maintenance and overall appearance of the stables. The stable master may or may not report to a [[Butler|steward]] or [[great house#Management of a Great House|estate manager]].

== Early life ==
Colon was born and grew up in the [[East New York, Brooklyn|East New York]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]]. Although his parents, mother Raymunda "Reina Gringa" Colon (née Alvarez Casildo)&lt;ref name=NYDailyNews-RaymundaColon-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCallister|first1=Jared|title=Caribbeat: ‘Invest Caribbean Now!’ September investment conference touts Saint Martin as isle of opportunity - Remembering 'Gringa' Colon|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/caribbeat-invest-caribbean-confab-eyes-saint-martin-article-1.2304521|accessdate=29 November 2015|work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|date=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and father Teofilo Colon Sr. were both from [[Honduras]] and spoke Spanish and Garifuna at home, Colon only spoke English.&lt;ref name=NYDailyNews-BeingGarifuna-2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pearson|first1=Erica|title=‘Being Garifuna’ blogger Teofilo Colon fans flames of his people’s pride online|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/garifuna-blogger-teofilo-colon-fans-flames-people-pride-online-article-1.977231|accessdate=29 November 2015|work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colon's parents were from the Tocamacho (known as Dugamachu in Garifuna) on his paternal side and Plaplaya (known as Bülagüriba in Garifuna) on his maternal side—two small villages of Garifuna territories off the northern coast of Honduras.&lt;ref name=RutgersAmHist-NJFolkFest-2013&gt;{{cite news|title=American Studies Presents: The 39th Annual New Jersey Folk Festival Celebrating Garifuna Traditions|url=https://www.joomag.com/magazine/new-jersey-folk-festival-program-book-2013-apr-2013/0898484001397014968?page=17|accessdate=29 November 2015|work=[[Rutgers University]] - Department of American Studies|date=27 April 2013|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colon began to learn the [[Garifuna language]] as an adult.

== Career ==
In addition to his freelance work in film and video and as a photographer for Friends of Crotona Park, Inc. in 2008, Colon began a [[Facebook]] group called "You Know You Are Garifuna/Garinagu When..." as an experiment to try and see how many Garifuna people he could find on Facebook. After connecting with thousands of Garinagu (plural for Garifuna), in an effort to understand more about his culture and provide a centralized resource of information, Colon created the ''Being Garifuna'' website to document stories and news about Garifuna people, history, and culture. The website is an online resource for people of Garifuna background to learn more about their culture and find news on current Garifuna cultural activities.&lt;ref name=CUNYTV-IndependentSources-2010&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pierre-Pierre|first1=Garry|last2=Vinca|first2=Vianora|title=Just A DREAM.

Among the work he has compiled about art and music of Garifuna people, Colon did extensive research on victims of the [[Happyland Fire]], a fire that killed many people who were thought to be of Garifuna background. One of the victims of the tragedy was Colon's cousin.&lt;ref name=BeingGarifuna-HappylandFire-2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Colon Jr.|first1=Teofilo|title=(Happy Land Fire) MARCH 25th, The FIFTEENTH Day of GARIFUNA American Heritage Month in New York (Happy Land Social Club Fire Tragedy)|url=http://beinggarifuna.com/?p=1322|accessdate=29 November 2015|work=Being Garifuna|date=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, Colon was recognized for his contribution to Garifuna culture by the Garifuna Coalition with a Garifuna Coalition Recognition award.&lt;ref name=CaribbeanLife-GarifunaCoalitionAward-2010&gt;{{cite news|title=Tagged for 'being Garifuna'|url=http://www.beinggarifuna.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/tioteo-caribbeanlife-august-18-24-2010.jpg|accessdate=29 November 2015|work=Caribbean Life|date=18 August 2010|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Colon was also Honorary Grand Marshal of the 2013 New Jersey Folk Festival.&lt;ref name=RutgersAmHist-NJFolkFest-2013 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3816">'''Walter Konrad Quakernack''' (July 9, 1907 – October 11, 1946) was an [[Oberscharführer]] in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] during the [[Nazi era]]. His SS membership number was 125266. He was tried for [[war crimes]] at the second [[Belsen Trial]] and executed.

== Biography ==
Quakernack was born in [[Bielefeld]], Germany. He served as a secretary in the [[Politische Abteilung]] at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] beginning in June 1940, where he participated in mass murders using the ''Genickschuss'' method of firing one bullet into the back of the neck, established by SS-[[Untersturmführer]] [[Ernst Grabner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/genocide/gcpol11.htm "The Auschwitz Extermination Camp"] University of the West of England, Holocaust archive. Source: "German Crimes in Poland. Volume 1. Central Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in Poland. Warsaw, 1946" Retrieved May 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Quakernack worked as a team leader in the [[crematorium]] at Auschwitz and participated in the gassing of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[POW]]s at the end of 1941. In September 1942, he was promoted to Oberscharführer and awarded the ''Kriegsverdienstkreuz'' ([[War Merit Cross]]), in September 1943. He was further promoted camp commandant in April 1944 at ''Arbeitslager'' Laurahütte, a subcamp of Auschwitz in [[Siemianowice Śląskie]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiergartenstrasse4.org/LAURAHÜTTE,172.html "Laurahütte"] Holocaust website. Retrieved May 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked at Auschwitz III, known as [[Monowitz]].&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;[http://www.bergenbelsen.co.uk/Pages/Staff/Staff.asp?CampStaffID=80&amp;Submit=View Timeline of Quackernack's life] Retrieved May 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  During his time in Auschwitz, he was known to personally kill prisoners in the following way: the prisoners were led to a big warehouse, Quackernack would then also enter under the influence of alcohol with an MP-40 machine pistol and fire at the prisoners continuously to the moment when they were all dead. Former member of Sonderkommando unit, tasked to get the bodies on trucks and take them to crematorium recalled, that Quackernack was staying in the middle of the warehouse, surrounded by dead bodies, holding an overheated gun, with his uniform entirely red from blood laughing loudly. Quackernack notoriously abused alcohol, so he was barely walking and had numerous outbursts of anger.

On January 23, 1945, he accompanied a [[death march]] of 500 prisoners from Auschwitz to the [[Mühlenberg, Hanover|Mühlenberg]] suburb of [[Hanover]], arriving around February 3, 1945. On April 8, 1945, he was part of a death-march evacuation from Mühlenberg to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]. On trial during part of the 2nd Belsen Trial, held at [[Celle]] and [[Lüneburg]], he was sentenced to death in June 1946 and  hanged on October 11, 1946.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt;

Quakernack is mentioned several times in the account of [[Filip Müller]], who worked in a [[Sonderkommando]] at Auschwitz and was an eye witness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
