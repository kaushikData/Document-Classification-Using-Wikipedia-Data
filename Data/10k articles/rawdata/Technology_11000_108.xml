      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2587">'''ArabDev''' is a [[Giza]] ([[Egypt]])-based non-profit organization that uses [[Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT) to "''promote existing development projects and for innovative developmental initiatives''". ArabDev provides women and youth with an educational venue for livelihood opportunities, through improved access to information and its use in skill development as well as small and micro enterprises. 

==Formation==

It was formed by its [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) both in [[Egypt]] and in the wider [[Arab]] region. ArabDev seeks to support [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] capacity-building among disadvantaged communities and grassroots organizations to get access to better work and life opportunities.

==Focus==

Its focus includes, using ICTs for:

* [[Poverty reduction]].
* Skill development.
* Dissemination of developmental information.
* Creation of linkages between NGOs.
* Supporting developmental advocacy.

==Current initiatives==

ArabDev, which is a member of the [[Association for Progressive Communications]], has reported recent initiatives to spread [[free software]] among youth in the disadvantaged south of Egypt. The group reported working with two middle schools in the Al Menia governorate, and also with the Faculty of Computer Engineering of the Menia University.

For this project, the goal is to establish a "core group" of [[FLOSS]] users in the [[Minya Governorate]], which could act as a south Egyptian "diffusion point".

So far, it has created computer labs or [[telecentres]] in some schools, which also offer their services to the community. In the [[Association for Progressive Communications]] report for 2005-06, it was stated that ArabDev reached an agreement with the Egyptian education department to collect fees, so as to make this venture sustainable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21893">'''Automatic test equipment''' or '''automated test equipment''' ('''ATE''') is any apparatus that performs tests on a device, known as the [[device under test]] (DUT), equipment under test (EUT) or unit under test (UUT), using [[automation]] to quickly perform measurements and evaluate the test results. An ATE can be a simple computer-controlled [[Multimeter|digital multimeter]], or a complicated system containing dozens of complex test instruments (real or simulated [[electronic test equipment]]) capable of automatically testing and diagnosing faults in sophisticated electronic [[packaged part]]s or on [[wafer testing]], including [[system on chip]]s and [[integrated circuit]]s. 
[[File:Keithley-model4200-CVU.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Keithley Instruments Series 4200|[[Keithley Instruments]] Series 4200 CVU]]

==Where it is used==
ATE is widely used in the electronic manufacturing industry to test electronic components and systems after being fabricated. ATE is also used to test [[avionics]] and the electronic modules in automobiles. It is used in military applications like radar and wireless communication.

===In the semiconductor industry===
Semiconductor ATE, named for testing [[semiconductor device]]s, can test a wide range of electronic devices and systems, from simple components ([[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, and [[inductor]]s) to [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs), [[printed circuit board]]s (PCBs), and complex, completely assembled electronic systems. ATE systems are designed to reduce the amount of test time needed to verify that a particular device works or to quickly find its faults before the part has a chance to be used in a final consumer product. To reduce manufacturing costs and improve [[Yield (engineering)|yield]], semiconductor devices should be tested after being fabricated to prevent defective devices ending up with the consumer.

==Components==
The semiconductor ATE architecture consists of master controller (usually a [[computer]]) that synchronizes one or more source and capture instruments (listed below). Historically, custom-designed controllers or [[relay]]s were used by ATE systems. The Device Under Test (DUT) is physically connected to the ATE by another robotic machine called a handler or [[wafer prober|prober]] and through a customized Interface Test Adapter (ITA) or "fixture" that adapts the ATE's resources to the DUT.

===Industrial PC===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:apc-industrial-pc-large.jpg|thumb|Industrial PC]] --&gt;
The [[industrial PC]] is nothing but a normal desktop computer packaged in 19-inch rack standards with sufficient PCI / PCIe slots for accommodating the Signal stimulator/sensing cards. This takes up the role of a controller in the ATE. Development of test applications and result storage is managed in this PC. Most modern semiconductor ATEs include multiple computer-controlled instruments to source or measure a wide range of parameters. The instruments may include device power supplies (DPS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=8P3iLCGbfp0C&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=%22device+power+supplies%22+DPS&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5851Y-ni0_&amp;sig=QSLboAneV4P7saoWXDYv8Wf-TQs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBWoVChMI56Lw6Zi9yAIVEg0aCh1wRge3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22device%20power%20supplies%22%20DPS&amp;f=false|author=Jose Moreira, Hubert Werkmann|title=An Engineer's Guide to Automated Testing of High-Speed Interfaces|publisher=''[[Artech House]]''|date=2010|accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.de/books?id=A6oYzUj1_jYC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=device+power+supplies+DPS&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwB2oVChMIzZ7dhp29yAIVB0wUCh1yIAKA#v=onepage&amp;q=device%20power%20supplies%20DPS&amp;f=false| title=Demystifying Mixed Signal Test Methods|publisher=''[[Elsevier]]''|date=3 June 2003|author=Mark Baker|accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; parametric measurement units (PMU), arbitrary waveform generators (AWG), digitizers, digital IOs, and utility supplies. The instruments  perform different measurements on the DUT, and the instruments are synchronized so that they source and measure waveforms at the proper times. Based on the requirement of response-time, real-time systems are also considered for stimulation and signal capturing.

===Mass interconnect===
The [[mass interconnect]] is a connector interface between test instruments (PXI, VXI, LXI, GPIB, SCXI, &amp; PCI) and devices/units under test (D/UUT). This section acts as a nodal point for signals going in/out between ATE and D/UUT.

===Example: Simple voltage measurement===
For example, to measure a voltage of a particular semiconductor device, the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) instruments in the ATE measure the voltage directly and send the results to a computer for signal processing, where the desired value is computed. This example shows that conventional instruments, like an [[Ammeter]], may not be used in many ATEs due to the limited number of measurements the instrument could make, and the time it would take to use the instruments to make the measurement. One key advantage to using DSP to measure the parameters is time. If we have to calculate the peak voltage of an electrical signal and other parameters of the signal, then we have to employ a peak detector instrument as well as other instruments to test the other parameters. If DSP-based instruments are used, however, then a sample of the signal is made and the other parameters can be computed from the single measurement.

===Test parameter requirements vs test time===
Not all devices are tested equally. Testing adds costs, so low-cost components are rarely tested completely, whereas medical or high costs components (where reliability is important) are frequently tested.

But testing the device for all parameters may or may not be required depending on the device functionality and end user. For example, if the device finds application in medical or life-saving products then many of its parameters must be tested, and some of the parameters must be guaranteed. But deciding on the parameters to be tested is a complex decision based on cost vs [[Yield (engineering)|yield]]. If the device is a complex digital device, with thousands of gates, then test fault coverage has to be calculated. Here again, the decision is complex based on test economics, based on frequency, number and type of I/Os in the device and the end-use application...

==Handler or prober and device test adapter==
ATE can be used on packaged parts (typical IC 'chip') or directly on the [[Silicon Wafer]]. Packaged parts use a handler to place the device on a customized interface board, whereas silicon wafers are tested directly with high precision probes. The ATE systems interact with the handler or prober to test the DUT.

===Packaged part ATE with handlers===
ATE systems typically interface with an automated placement tool, called a "handler", that physically places the Device Under Test (DUT) on an Interface Test Adapter (ITA) so that it can be measured by the equipment. There may also be an Interface Test Adapter (ITA), a device just making electronic connections between the ATE and the Device Under Test (also called Unit Under Test or UUT), but also it might contain an additional circuitry to adapt signals between the ATE and the DUT and has physical facilities to mount the DUT. Finally, a [[Jack (connector)|socket]] is used to bridge the connection between the ITA and the DUT. A socket must survive the rigorous demands of a production floor, so they are usually replaced frequently.

Simple electrical interface diagram: ATE → ITA → DUT (package) ← Handler

===Silicon wafer ATE with probers===
Wafer-based ATEs typically use a device called a [[Wafer prober|Prober]] that moves across a silicon wafer to test the device.

Simple electrical interface diagram: ATE → Prober → Wafer (DUT)

===Multi-site===
One way to improve test time is to test multiple devices at once. ATE systems can now support having multiple "sites" where the ATE resources are shared by each site. Some resources can be used in parallel, others must be serialized to each DUT.

==Programming ATE==
The ATE computer uses modern computer languages (like [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[LabVIEW]] or [[Smalltalk]]) with additional statements to control the ATE equipment through standard and proprietary [[application programming interface]]s (API). Also some dedicated computer languages exists, like [[Abbreviated Test Language for All Systems]] (ATLAS). Automatic test equipment can also be automated using a [[test execution engine]] such as [[National Instruments]]' TestStand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ni.com/teststand/&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes [[automatic test pattern generation]] is used to help design the series of tests.

==Test data (STDF)==
Many ATE platforms used in the semiconductor industry output data using [[Standard Test Data Format]] (STDF)

==Diagnostics==
Automatic test equipment diagnostics is the part of an ATE test that determines the faulty components. ATE tests perform two basic functions. The first is to test whether or not the Device Under Test is working correctly. The second is when the DUT is not working correctly, to diagnose the reason. The diagnostic portion can be the most difficult and costly portion of the test. It is typical for ATE to reduce a failure to a cluster or ambiguity group of components. One method to help reduce these ambiguity groups is the addition of [[analog signature analysis]] testing to the ATE system. Diagnostics are often aided by the use of [[flying probe]] testing.

==Test equipment switching==
The addition of a high-speed [[Automatic test switching|switching system]] to a test system's configuration allows for faster, more cost-effective testing of multiple devices, and is designed to reduce both test errors and costs. Designing a test system's switching configuration requires an understanding of the signals to be switched and the tests to be performed, as well as the switching hardware form factors available.

==Test equipment platforms==
Several modular electronic instrumentation platforms are currently in common use for configuring automated electronic test and measurement systems. These systems are widely employed for incoming inspection, quality assurance, and production testing of electronic devices and subassemblies. Industry-standard communication interfaces link signal sources with measurement instruments in "[[19-inch rack|rack-and-stack]]" or chassis-/mainframe-based systems, often under the control of a custom software application running on an external PC.

===GPIB/IEEE-488===
The General Purpose Interface Bus ([[GPIB]]) is an IEEE-488 (a standard created by the [[IEEE|Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]) standard parallel interface used for attaching sensors and programmable instruments to a computer. GPIB is a digital 8-bit parallel communications interface capable of achieving data transfers of more than 8 Mbytes/s. It allows daisy-chaining up to 14 instruments to a system controller using a 24-pin connector. It is one of the most common I/O interfaces present in instruments and is designed specifically for instrument control applications. The IEEE-488 specifications standardized this bus and defined its electrical, mechanical, and functional specifications, while also defining its basic software communication rules. GPIB works best for applications in industrial settings that require a rugged connection for instrument control.

The original GPIB standard was developed in the late 1960s by Hewlett-Packard to connect and control the programmable instruments the company manufactured. The introduction of digital controllers and programmable test equipment created a need for a standard, high-speed interface for communication between instruments and controllers from various vendors. In 1975, the IEEE published ANSI/IEEE Standard 488-1975, IEEE Standard Digital Interface for Programmable Instrumentation, which contained the electrical, mechanical, and functional specifications of an interfacing system. This standard was subsequently revised in 1978 (IEEE-488.1) and 1990 (IEEE-488.2). The IEEE 488.2 specification includes the Standard Commands for Programmable Instrumentation (SCPI), which define specific commands that each instrument class must obey. SCPI ensures compatibility and configurability among these instruments.

The IEEE-488 bus has long been popular because it is simple to use and takes advantage of a large selection of programmable instruments and stimuli. Large systems, however, have the following limitations:

*'''Driver fanout''' capacity limits the system to 14 devices plus a controller.
*'''Cable length''' limits the controller-device distance to two meters per device or 20 meters total, whichever is less. This imposes transmission problems on systems spread out in a room or on systems that require remote measurements.
*'''Primary addresses''' limit the system to 30 devices with primary addresses. Modern instruments rarely use secondary addresses so this puts a 30-device limit on system size.&lt;ref&gt;ICS Electronics.

===LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation (LXI)===
The [[LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation|LXI]] Standard defines the communication protocols for instrumentation and data acquisition systems using Ethernet. These systems are based on small, modular instruments, using low-cost, open-standard LAN (Ethernet). LXI-compliant instruments offer the size and integration advantages of modular instruments without the cost and form factor constraints of card-cage architectures. Through the use of Ethernet communications, the LXI Standard allows for flexible packaging, high-speed I/O, and standardized use of LAN connectivity in a broad range of commercial, industrial, aerospace, and military applications. Every LXI-compliant instrument includes an Interchangeable Virtual Instrument (IVI) driver to simplify communication with non-LXI instruments, so LXI-compliant devices can communicate with devices that are not themselves LXI compliant (i.e., instruments that employ GPIB, VXI, PXI, etc.). This simplifies building and operating hybrid configurations of instruments.

LXI instruments sometimes employ scripting using embedded test script processors for configuring test and measurement applications. Script-based instruments provide architectural flexibility, improved performance, and lower cost for many applications. Scripting enhances the benefits of LXI instruments, and LXI offers features that both enable and enhance scripting. Although the current LXI standards for instrumentation do not require that instruments be programmable or implement scripting, several features in the LXI specification anticipate programmable instruments and provide useful functionality that enhances scripting's capabilities on LXI-compliant instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Paul and Todd A. Hayes. LXI Connection.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714005908/http://www.lxiconnexion.com/articles/0708/0708_scripting.pdf Benefits of LXI and Scripting.] July 2008. Retrieved January 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===VME eXtensions for Instrumentation (VXI)===
The [[VXI]] bus architecture is an open standard platform for automated test based on the [[VMEbus]]. Introduced in 1987, VXI uses all Eurocard form factors and adds trigger lines, a local bus, and other functions suited for measurement applications. VXI systems are based on a mainframe or chassis with up to 13 slots into which various VXI instrument modules can be installed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfacebus.com/Equipment_VXI_Chassis_Manufacturers.html Hardware Mechanical Components VXI Chassis and Case Manufacturers]. Retrieved December 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The chassis also provides all the power supply and cooling requirements for the chassis and the instruments it contains. VXI bus modules are typically [[Rack unit|6U]] in height.

===PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation (PXI)===
[[PXI]] is a peripheral bus specialized for data acquisition and real-time control systems. Introduced in 1997, PXI uses the CompactPCI [[Rack unit|3U]] and [[Rack unit|6U]] form factors and adds trigger lines, a local bus, and other functions suited for measurement applications. PXI hardware and software specifications are developed and maintained by the PXI Systems Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;PXI Systems Alliance. [http://www.pxisa.org/Specifications/Default.aspx Specifications]. Retrieved December 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 50 manufacturers around the world produce PXI hardware.&lt;ref&gt;PXI Systems Alliance.

===Universal Serial Bus (USB)===
The [[USB]] connects peripheral devices, such as keyboards and mice, to PCs. The USB is a [[Plug &amp; Play|Plug and Play]] bus that can handle up to 127 devices on one port, and has a theoretical maximum throughput of 480 Mbit/s (high-speed USB defined by the USB 2.0 specification). Because USB ports are standard features of PCs, they are a natural evolution of conventional serial port technology. However, it is not widely used in building industrial test and measurement systems for a number of reasons; for example, USB cables are not industrial grade, are noise sensitive, can accidentally become detached, and the maximum distance between the controller and the device is 30 m. Like [[RS-232]], USB is useful for applications in a laboratory setting that do not require a rugged bus connection.

===RS-232===
RS-232 is a specification for serial communication that is popular in analytical and scientific instruments, as well for controlling peripherals such as printers. Unlike GPIB, with the RS-232 interface, it is possible to connect and control only one device at a time. RS-232 is also a relatively slow interface with typical data rates of less than 20 kbytes/s. RS-232 is best suited for laboratory applications compatible with a slower, less rugged connection.

=== JTAG/Boundary-scan IEEE Std 1149.1===
JTAG/Boundary-scan can be implemented as a PCB-level or system-level interface bus for the purpose of controlling the pins of an IC and facilitating continuity (interconnection) tests on a test target (UUT) and also functional cluster tests on logic devices or groups of devices. It can also be used as a controlling interface for other instrumentation that can be embedded into the ICs themselves (see IEEE 1687) or instruments that are part of an external controllable test system.

===Test script processors and a channel expansion bus===
One of the most recently developed test system platforms employs instrumentation equipped with onboard test script processors combined with a high-speed bus. In this approach, one "master" instrument runs a test script (a small program) that controls the operation of the various "slave" instruments in the test system, to which it is linked via a high-speed LAN-based trigger synchronization and inter-unit communication bus. Scripting is writing programs in a scripting language to coordinate a sequence of actions.

This approach is optimized for small message transfers that are characteristic of test and measurement applications. With very little network overhead and a 100Mbit/sec data rate, it is significantly faster than GPIB and 100BaseT Ethernet in real applications.

The advantage of this platform is that all connected instruments behave as one tightly integrated multi-channel system, so users can scale their test system to fit their required channel counts cost-effectively. A system configured on this type of platform can stand alone as a complete measurement and automation solution, with the master unit controlling sourcing, measuring, pass/fail decisions, test sequence flow control, binning, and the component handler or prober. Support for dedicated trigger lines means that synchronous operations between multiple instruments equipped with onboard Test Script Processors that are linked by this high speed bus can be achieved without the need for additional trigger connections.&lt;ref&gt;Cigoy, Dale.

== Determining best available retrofit technology ==
Best available retrofit technology is defined by USC § 7491:&lt;blockquote&gt;in determining best available retrofit technology the State (or the Administrator in determining emission limitations which reflect such technology) shall take into consideration the costs of compliance, the energy and nonair quality environmental impacts of compliance, any existing pollution control technology in use at the source, the remaining useful life of the source, and the degree of improvement in visibility which may reasonably be anticipated to result from the use of such technology;&lt;ref name=Cornell169ACAA /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Navajo Generating Station==
A BART rule may take into account the interests of stakeholders associated with the source.

It has been defined in Mesh Profile Specification&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=429633|title=Mesh Profile Bluetooth® Specification|last=|first=|date=2017-07-13|website=Bluetooth Technology Website|format=PDF download|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mesh Model Specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=429634|title=Mesh Model Bluetooth® Specification|last=|first=|date=2017-07-13|website=Bluetooth Technology Website|format=PDF download|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Communication is carried in the messages that may be up to 384 bytes long, when using Segmentation and Reassembly (SAR) mechanism, but most of the messages fit in one segment, that is 11 bytes. Each message starts with an opcode, which may be a single byte (for special messages), 2 bytes (for standard messages), or 3 bytes (for vendor-specific messages).

Every message has a source and a destination address, determining which devices process messages. Devices publish messages to destinations which can be single things / groups of things / everything.

Each message has a sequence number that protects the network against replay attacks. 

Each message is encrypted and authenticated. Two keys are used to secure messages: (1) network keys – allocated to a single mesh network, (2) application keys – specific for a given application functionality, e.g. turning the light on vs reconfiguring the light.

Messages have a [[time to live]] (TTL). Each time message is received and retransmitted, TTL is decremented which limits the number of "hops", eliminating endless loops.

Bluetooth Mesh is a [[Flooding (computer networking)|flood network]]. It's based on the nodes relaying the messages: every relay node that receives a network packet that authenticates against a known network key that is not in message cache, that has a TTL ≥ 2 can be retransmitted with TTL = TTL - 1.
Message cache used to prevent relaying messages recently seen.

Bluetooth Mesh has a layered architecture, with multiple layers as below.
{| class="wikitable"
!Layer
!Functionality
|-
|Model&amp;nbsp;Layer
|It defines a standard way to exchange application specific messages. For example, a Light Lightness Model defines an interoperable way to control lightness. There are mandatory models, called Foundation Models, defining states and messages needed to manage a mesh network.
|-
|Access&amp;nbsp;Layer
|It defines mechanism to ensure that data is transmitted and received in the right context of a model and its associated application keys.
|-
|Upper&amp;nbsp;Transport&amp;nbsp;Layer
|It defines authenticated encryption of access layer packets using an application (or device specific key). It also defines some control messages to manage Friendship or to notify the behavior of node using Heartbeat messages.
|-
|Lower&amp;nbsp;Transport&amp;nbsp;Layer
|This layer defines a reliable (through a Block Acknowledgement) Segmented transmission upper layer packets, when a complete upper layer packet can't be carried in a single network layer packet. It also defines a mechanism to reassemble segments on the receiver.
|-
|Network&amp;nbsp;Layer
|This layer defines how transport packets are addressed over network to one or more nodes. It defines relay functionality for forwarding messages by a relay node to extended the range. It handles the network layer authenticated encryption using network key.
|-
|Bearer&amp;nbsp;Layer
|It defines how the network packets are exchanged between nodes. Mesh Profile Specification defines BLE advert bearer and BLE GATT bearer. Mesh Profile defines Proxy Protocol, through which mesh packets can be exchanged via other bearers like TCP/IP.
|}

== Theoretical limits ==
It's yet to be determined what are the practical limits of Bluetooth Mesh technology. There are some limits that are built into the specification, though:
{| class="wikitable"
!Limit for a network 
!Value 
!Remarks
|-
|Maximum number of nodes
|32 767
|The limit is 32768 addresses and while a node may occupy more than one address, practical limit is most likely lower
|-
|Maximum number of groups
|16 384
Number of virtual groups is 2&lt;sup&gt;128&lt;/sup&gt;.
|
|-
|Maximum number of scenes
|65 535
|
|-
|Maximum number of subnets
|4 096
|
|-
|Maximum TTL
|126
|
|}

== Mesh models ==
As of version 1.0 of Bluetooth Mesh specification, the following standard models and model groups have been defined:

=== Foundation models ===
Foundation models have been defined in the core specification. Two of them are mandatory for all mesh nodes.
* Configuration Server (mandatory)
* Configuration Client
* Health Server (mandatory)
* Health Client

=== Generic models ===
* Generic OnOff Server, used to represent devices that do not fit any of the model descriptions defined but support the generic properties of On/Off
* Generic Level Server, keeping the state of an element in a 16-bit signed integer
* Generic Default Transition Time Server, used to represent a default transition time for a variety of devices
* Generic Power OnOff Server &amp; Generic Power OnOff Setup Server, used to represent devices that do not fit any of the model descriptions but support the generic properties of On/Off
* Generic Power Level Server &amp; Generic Power Level Setup Server, including a Generic Power Actual state, a Generic Power Last state, a Generic Power Default state and a Generic Power Range state

== Provisioning ==
Provisioning is a process of installing the device into a network. It is a mandatory step to build a Bluetooth Mesh network.

In the provisioning process, a provisioner securely distributes a network key and a unique address space for a device. Provisioning protocol uses P256 Elliptic Curve [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange|Diffie-Hellman]] Key Exchange to create a temporary key to encrypt network key and other information. This provides security from a passive eavesdropper. 
It also provides various authentication mechanisms to protect network information, from an active eavesdropper who uses [[Man-in-the-middle attack|Man-In-The-Middle attack]], during provisioning process.

A key unique to a device known as "Device Key" is derived from elliptic curve shared secret on provisioner and device during the provisioning process. This device key is used by the provisioner to encrypt messages for that specific device.

The provisioning can be performed using a Bluetooth GATT connection or advertising using the specific bearer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Terminology used in Bluetooth mesh networking specification ==
* Destination: The address to which a message is sent.
* Element: An addressable entity within a device.
* Model: Standardized operation of typical user scenarios.
* Node: A provisioned device.
* Provisioner: A node that can add a device to a mesh network.
* Relay: A node able to retransmit messages.
* Source: The address from which a message is sent.

It is primarily suited for people who have [[conductive hearing losses]], [[unilateral hearing loss]], single-sided deafness and people with mixed hearing losses who cannot otherwise wear 'in the ear' or 'behind the ear' hearing aids. They are more expensive than conventional hearing aids, and their placement involves invasive surgery which carries a risk of complications,&lt;ref name="Banga 2011" /&gt; although when complications do occur, they are usually minor.&lt;ref name=Wazen2011 /&gt;

Two of the causes of [[hearing loss]] are lack of function in the [[inner ear]] ([[cochlea]]) and when the sound has problems in reaching the nerve cells of the inner ear.  Example of the first include age-related hearing loss and hearing loss due to noise exposure. A patient born without external [[ear canals]] is an example of the latter for which a conventional hearing aid with a mould in the ear canal opening would not be effective. Some with this condition have normal inner ear function, as the external ear canal and the inner ear are developed at different stages during pregnancy. With normal inner anatomy, sound conducted by the skull bone improves hearing.

A vibrator with  a steel spring over the head or in heavy frames of eyeglasses pressed towards the bone behind the ear has been used to bring sound to the inner ear.  This has, however, several disadvantages, such as discomfort and pain due to the pressure needed.&lt;ref name="RaicevichBurwood2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Raicevich |first1= George |last2= Burwood |first2= Eric |last3= Dillon |first3= Harvey |title= Taking the pressure off bone conduction hearing aid users |journal= Australian and New Zealand Journal of Audiology |volume= 30 |issue= 2 |year= 2008 |pages=113–8 |doi=10.1375/audi.30.2.113}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound quality is also impaired as much of the sound energy is lost in the soft tissue over the skull bone,&lt;ref name="Mylanus-1994"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Mylanus | first1 = E.A. | last2 = Snik | first2 = A.F. | last3 = Cremers | first3 = C.W. | title = Influence of the thickness of the skin and subcutaneous tissue covering the mastoid on bone-conduction thresholds obtained transcutaneously versus percutaneously | journal = Scandinavian Audiology | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 201–3 | year = 1994 | doi = 10.3109/01050399409047509 | pmid = 7997838 }}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly for the higher sound frequencies important for speech understanding in noise.

== Medical use ==
[[File:The sound processor from Oticon Medical behind the ear.png|thumb|A sound processor behind the ear]]
Bone-anchored hearing aids use a surgically implanted [[abutment]] to transmit sound by direct [[bone conduction|conduction through bone]] to the inner ear, bypassing the external auditory canal and middle ear. A titanium prosthesis is surgically embedded into the skull with a small abutment exposed outside the skin. A sound processor sits on this abutment and transmits sound vibrations to the titanium implant. The implant vibrates the skull and inner ear, which stimulate the nerve fibers of the inner ear, allowing hearing.

The surgery is often performed under local anaesthesia and as an outpatient procedure. An important piece of information for patients is that if they for whatever reason are not satisfied with the BAHA solution, removing the implant is easy. No other ear surgical procedure is reversible like this.

By bypassing the outer or middle ear, BAHA can increase hearing in noisy situations and help localise sounds. In addition to improved speech understanding, it results in a natural sound with less distortion and feedback compared with conventional hearing aids.&lt;ref name="FlynnSadeghi2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Flynn |first1= Mark C. |last2= Sadeghi |first2= Andre |last3= Halvarsson |first3= Glenn |title= Baha solutions for patients with severe mixed hearing loss |journal= Cochlear Implants International |year= 2009|pmid= 19195004 |doi= 10.1179/cim.2009.10.Supplement-1.43 |volume=10 Suppl 1 |pages=43–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LinBowditch2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lin |first1= Li-Mei |last2= Bowditch |first2= Stephen |last3= Anderson |first3= Michael J. |last4= May |first4= Bradford |last5= Cox |first5= Kenneth M. |last6= Niparko |first6= John K. |displayauthors= 4 |title= Amplification in the rehabilitation of unilateral deafness: Speech in noise and directional hearing effects with bone-anchored hearing and contralateral routing of signal amplification |journal= Otology &amp; Neurotology |volume= 27 |issue= 2 |year= 2006 |pages= 172–82 |pmid= 16436986 |doi= 10.1097/01.mao.0000196421.30275.73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HolSnik2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hol |first1= Myrthe K.S. |last2= Snik |first2= Ad F.M. |last3= Mylanus |first3= Emmanuel A.M. |last4= Cremers |first4= Cor W.R.J. |title= Long-term results of bone-anchored hearing aid recipients who had previously used air-conduction hearing aids |url= http://archotol.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=648923 |journal= [[Archives of Otolaryngology—Head &amp; Neck Surgery]] |volume= 131 |issue= 4 |year= 2005 |pages=321–5 |pmid= 15837900 |doi= 10.1001/archotol.131.4.321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WatsonSilva2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Watson |first1= G.J. |last2= Silva |first2= S. |last3= Lawless |first3= T. |last4= Harling |first4= J.L. |last5= Sheehan |first5= P.Z.|displayauthors= 4 |title= Bone anchored hearing aids: A preliminary assessment of the impact on outpatients and cost when rehabilitating hearing in chronic suppurative otitis media |journal= Clinical Otolaryngology |volume= 33 |issue= 4 |year= 2008 |pages= 338–42 |pmid= 18983343 |doi= 10.1111/j.1749-4486.2008.01698.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Snik-2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Snik | first1 = A.F. | last2 = Mylanus | first2 = E.A. | last3 = Proops | first3 = D.W. | last4 = Wolfaardt | first4 = J.F. | last5 = Hodgetts | first5 = W.E. | last6 = Somers | first6 = T. | last7 = Niparko | first7 = J.K. | last8 = Wazen | first8 = J.J. | last9 = Sterkers | first9 = O. | displayauthors = 4 | title = Consensus statements on the BAHA system: where do we stand at present? | url = http://ww.annals.com/toc/auto_article_process.php?year=2005&amp;page=1&amp;id=14999&amp;sn=195 | journal = [[Annals of Otology, Rhinology, and Laryngology]] | volume = 114 | issue = 12 Supp. 195 | pages = 2–12 | date = December 2005 | doi = 10.1177/0003489405114S1201 | pmid = 16619473 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140503101146/http://ww.annals.com/toc/auto_article_process.php?year=2005&amp;page=1&amp;id=14999&amp;sn=195 | archivedate = 3 May 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ear canal is left open for comfort, and helps to reduce any problems caused by chronic ear infections or allergies. In patients with single-sided sensorineural deafness, BAHA sends the sound by the skull bone from the deaf side to the inner ear of the hearing side. This transfer of sound gives a 360° sound awareness.

BAHAs may facilitate normal language development.&lt;ref name="pmid18667244"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verhagen|first=C.V.M.|author2=Hol, M.K.S. |author3=Coppens-Schellekens, W. |author4=Snik, A.F.M. |author5= Cremers, C.W.R.J. |title=The Baha Softband|journal=International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology|date=1 October 2008|volume=72|issue=10|pages=1455–1459|doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2008.06.009|pmid=18667244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chronic ear disease ===
This fairly common condition is often associated with continuous or intermittent drainage from the ear canal. These patients may also have a hearing loss and need amplification. A conventional air conduction aid with a mold placed in the ear canal opening may not be appropriate due to the drainage, and may even provoke drainage. If the hearing loss is significant an air conduction aid may have difficulty overcoming the dysfunction of the eardrum and middle ear bones. Bone conduction hearing device bypassing the middle ear may be a more appropriate treatment for these patients. Good transmission of sound in the bone, with reduced attenuation and distortion may be possible.

=== Single-sided deafness ===
A person with [[unilateral hearing loss]] may have functional difficulty hearing even when the other ear is normal, particularly in demanding situations such as noisy environments and when several people are speaking the same time. A complication in single-sided deafness is hearing impairment in the hearing ear. Conventional ear surgery involves a risk of hearing loss due to the surgical procedure. Most ear surgeons are thus reluctant to perform surgery on an only hearing ear.{{Medical citation needed|date=May 2014}} The BAHA surgery avoids this risk and may be an appropriate treatment. An extended trial of a BAHA system with a headband prior to surgery led to more realistic expectations. In the trial, 50% of the candidates wished to proceed to surgery.&lt;ref name="PenningsGulliver2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pennings |first1 =R.J.E. |last2= Gulliver |first2= M. |last3= Morris |first3= D.P. |title= The importance of an extended preoperative trial of BAHA in unilateral sensorineural hearing loss: a prospective cohort study |journal= Clinical Otolaryngology |volume= 36 |issue= 5 |year= 2011 |pages= 442–9 |doi= 10.1111/j.1749-4486.2011.02388.x |pmid= 21883961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== External ear canal problems ===
Irritation in the external ear canal due to inflammation or eczema may be a condition for which a conventional air conduction aid is not an appropriate treatment. Direct bone conduction may be an option.

=== Malformations ===
Patients with malformations are not always suitable for reconstructive surgery. [[Treacher Collins syndrome]] patients may have significant malformations with ossicular defects and an abnormal route of the facial nerve. These structures, as well as the inner ear, could be in danger at surgery.

Patients with [[Down syndrome]] may have a narrow ear canal and middle ear malformation leading to impaired hearing. Some part of the cognitive delay seen in these children may be partly due to their poor hearing.

The surgery can only take place once the skull is at least 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm thick.&lt;ref name="Tjellström-2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PapsinSirimanna1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Papsin |first1= Blake C. |last2= Sirimanna |first2= Tony K.S. |last3= Albert |first3= David M. |last4= Bailey |first4= C. Martin |title= Surgical experience with bone-anchored hearing aids in children |journal= The Laryngoscope |volume= 107 |issue= 6 |year= 1997 |pages= 801–6|pmid= 9185737 |doi= 10.1097/00005537-199706000-00015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|date=May 2014}}&lt;!-- see PMID 17210090 --&gt; Children who suffer certain syndromes may have a slighter build, thinner bone, or unusual anatomy. Other children may have a thicker skull at a younger age, so it is difficult to give a specific age for surgery.

In the U.S., the [[Food and Drug Administration]] only approves BAHA implantation of children aged five years or older.

For infants and young children prior to surgery, the sound processor can be worn on a head band or soft band which the infant wears to hold it against the skull.

Complications of BAHA systems can be considered as either related to the bone (hard tissue) or the [[soft tissue]].&lt;ref name=Wazen2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wazen|first=JJ|author2=Wycherly, B |author3=Daugherty, J |title=Complications of bone-anchored hearing devices|journal=Advances in oto-rhino-laryngology|date=2011|volume=71|pages=63–72|pmid=21389706|doi=10.1159/000323583|series=Advances in Oto-Rhino-Laryngology|isbn=978-3-8055-9700-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Bone
** Failure of osseointegration
** Chronic infection
** Trauma
* Soft tissue
** Irritation of the skin surrounding the implant
** Skin flap [[necrosis]] (death of the skin flap, e.g. due to interrupted blood supply)
** Overgrowth of skin over the device
** Wound dehiscence (splitting apart of the wound)
** Bleeding or [[hematoma]] formation
** Persistent pain

Soft-tissue complications are much more common, and most are managed with topical treatments. Children are more likely to suffer both kinds of complications than adults. Sometimes, a second surgical procedure is required. Complications are less likely with good wound hygiene.&lt;ref name=Wazen2011 /&gt; Other drawbacks of BAHA include accidental or spontaneous loss of the bone implant, and patient refusal for treatment due to stigma.&lt;ref name="Håkansson2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Håkansson |first1= Bo |title= The future of bone conduction hearing devices |journal= Advances in Oto-Rhino-Laryngology |volume= 71 |year= 2011 |pages= 140–52 |pmid= 21389714 |doi= 10.1159/000323715|series= Advances in Oto-Rhino-Laryngology |isbn= 978-3-8055-9700-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surgical procedure ==
The bone behind the ear is exposed through a U-shaped or straight incision or with the help of a specially designed BAHA dermatome. A hole, 3 or 4&amp;nbsp;mm deep depending on the thickness of the bone, is drilled. The hole is widened and the implant with the mounted coupling is inserted under generous cooling to minimize surgical trauma to the bone.

Some surgeons perform a reduction of the subcutaneous soft tissue. The rationale for this is to reduce the mobility between implant and skin to avoid inflammation at the penetration site. This reduction of the soft tissue has been questioned and some surgeons do not perform any or a minimum of it. The rationale for this is that any surgery will result in some scar tissue that could be the focus of infection. The infections seen early during the development of the surgical procedure could perhaps be explained by the lack of seal between implant and abutment allowing bacteria to enter the space. A new helium tight seal may be advantageous and prevent biofilm formation. This will also allow the surgeon to use longer abutments should a need exist. Three to six weeks later or even earlier, the audiologist will fit and adjust the hearing processor according to the patient's hearing level. The fitting will be made using a special program in a computer.

The original surgical procedure has been described in detail by Tjellström et al. 2001.&lt;ref name="Tjellström-2001"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Tjellström | first1 = A. | last2 = Håkansson | first2 = B. | last3 = Granström | first3 = G. | title = Bone-anchored hearing aids: Current status in adults and children | journal = Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 337–64 | date= April 2001 | doi = 10.1016/S0030-6665(05)70335-2 | pmid = 11382574 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Handling ==
[[File:Baha implant in hand.jpg|thumb|An implant shown in actual size in adult hand]]
An area where skin is penetrated requires care and cleaning because of the risk of inflammation around the abutment. Daily cleaning is required.

Surgery is thus often delayed until the age of four to five years. In the meantime, the child with bilateral atresia can be fitted with a band around the head with a coupling for a BAHA. This may be done at the age of one month. Infants at this age may tolerate this well.&lt;ref name="PapsinSirimanna1997" /&gt;

== History ==
Patients with chronic ear infection where the drum and/or the small bones in the middle ear are damaged often have hearing loss, but difficulties in using a hearing aid fitted in the ear canal. Direct bone conduction through a vibrator attached to a skin-penetrating implant addresses these disadvantages.

In 1977, the first three patients were implanted with a bone-conduction hearing solution by Anders Tjellström at the Ear, Nose, and Throat Department at [[Sahlgrenska University Hospital]] in Gothenburg, Sweden. A 4-mm-long titanium screw with a diameter of 3.75&amp;nbsp;mm was inserted in the bone behind the ear, and a bone conduction hearing aid was attached.

The term osseointegration was coined by Professor Brånemark. During animal studies, he found the bone tissue attached to the titanium implant without any soft tissue in between. He also showed an such an implant could take a heavy load. His definition of osseointegration was "direct contact between living bone and an implant that can take a load".

The first clinical application of titanium was in oral surgery, where implants were used for retention of dentures. Brånemark sought an acoustic way to evaluate osseointegration. A patient with implants in the jaws was fitted with a bone vibrator on one of his implants. When tested, the patient experienced very loud sound even at low stimulation levels, indicating sound could propagate very well in the bone. It has later been shown by Håkansson that the sound transmission in bone is linear, indicating low distortion of the sound.

The implant in the bone is made of titanium and will osseointegrate. The hearing instrument is impedance-matched. [[Osseointegration]] has been defined as the direct contact between living bone and an implant that can take a load, with no soft tissue at the interface.

== Costs ==
In the US, the cost of the Baha device is about $4,000. In the Netherlands, the cost of the device is around €3000 (in 2008). The cost of the titanium implant, surgery, and aftercare from surgeon and audiologist must also be considered.

[[File:Cyclone combustor.jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|Flame stabilized by cyclone.]]

A '''combustor''' is a component or area of a [[gas turbine]], [[ramjet]], or [[scramjet]] [[engine]] where [[combustion]] takes place. It is also known as a '''burner''', '''combustion chamber''' or '''flame holder'''. In a gas turbine engine, the ''combustor'' or [[combustion chamber]] is fed high pressure air by the compression system. The combustor then heats this air at constant pressure. After heating, air passes from the combustor through the nozzle guide vanes to the turbine. In the case of a ramjet or scramjet engines, the air is directly fed to the nozzle.

A combustor must contain and maintain stable combustion despite very high air flow rates. To do so combustors are carefully designed to first mix and ignite the air and fuel, and then mix in more air to complete the combustion process. Early gas turbine engines used a single chamber known as a can type combustor. Today three main configurations exist: can, annular and cannular (also referred to as can-annular tubo-annular). Afterburners are often considered another type of combustor.

Combustors play a crucial role in determining many of an engine's operating characteristics, such as fuel efficiency, levels of emissions and transient response (the response to changing conditions such as fuel flow and air speed).

==Fundamentals==
[[File:Combustor on Rolls-Royce Nene turbojet (1).jpg|thumb|Combustor on a [[Rolls-Royce Nene]] [[turbojet]]]]
The objective of the combustor in a gas turbine is to add energy to the system to power the [[turbines]], and produce a high velocity gas to exhaust through the nozzle in aircraft applications. As with any engineering challenge, accomplishing this requires balancing many design considerations, such as the following: 
*Completely combust the fuel. Otherwise, the engine wastes the unburnt fuel and creates unwanted emissions of unburnt hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide (CO) and soot.
*Low pressure loss across the combustor. The turbine which the combustor feeds needs high pressure flow to operate efficiently.
*The flame (combustion) must be held (contained) inside of the combustor. If combustion happens further back in the engine, the turbine stages can easily be overheated and damaged. Additionally, as [[turbine blade]]s continue to grow more advanced and are able to withstand higher temperatures, the combustors are being designed to burn at higher temperatures and the parts of the combustor need to be designed to withstand those higher temperatures.
*It should be capable of relighting at high altitude in an event of engine flame-out.
*Uniform exit temperature profile. If there are hot spots in the exit flow, the turbine may be subjected to [[thermal stress]] or other types of damage. Similarly, the temperature profile within the combustor should avoid hot spots, as those can damage or destroy a combustor from the inside.
*Small physical size and weight. Space and weight is at a premium in aircraft applications, so a well designed combustor strives to be compact. Non-aircraft applications, like power generating gas turbines, are not as constrained by this factor.
*Wide range of operation. Most combustors must be able to operate with a variety of inlet pressures, temperatures, and mass flows. These factors change with both engine settings and environmental conditions (I.e., full throttle at low altitude can be very different from idle throttle at high altitude).
*Environmental emissions. There are strict regulations on aircraft emissions of pollutants like carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides, so combustors need to be designed to minimize those emissions. (See ''Emissions'' section below)

===History===
Advancements in combustor technology focused on several distinct areas; emissions, operating range, and durability. Early jet engines produced large amounts of smoke, so early combustor advances, in the 1950s, were aimed at reducing the smoke produced by the engine. Once smoke was essentially eliminated, efforts turned in the 1970s to reducing other emissions, like unburned [[hydrocarbons]] and [[carbon monoxide]] (for more details, see the ''Emissions'' section below). The 1970s also saw improvement in combustor durability, as new manufacturing methods improved liner (see ''Components'' below) lifetime by nearly 100 times that of early liners. In the 1980s combustors began to improve their efficiency across the whole operating range; combustors tended to be highly efficient (99%+) at full power, but that efficiency dropped off at lower settings. Development over that decade improved efficiencies at lower levels. The 1990s and 2000s saw a renewed focus on reducing emissions, particularly [[nitrogen oxides]]. Combustor technology is still being actively researched and advanced, and much modern research focuses on improving the same aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Koff, Bernard L. (2004). Gas Turbine Technology Evolution: A Designer’s Perspective. ''Journal of Propulsion and Power''. Vol. 20, No. 4, July–August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Components===
[[File:Combustor diagram componentsPNG.png|frameless|border|upright=2|right]]
;{{vanchor |Case}}
The case is the outer shell of the combustor, and is a fairly simple structure. The casing generally requires little maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson and Blazowski, pp. 119–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The case is protected from thermal loads by the air flowing in it, so thermal performance is of limited concern. However, the casing serves as a pressure vessel that must withstand the difference between the high pressures inside the combustor and the lower pressure outside. That mechanical (rather than thermal) load is a driving design factor in the case.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, Heiser, and Pratt, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt;
;{{vanchor |Diffuser}}
The purpose of the diffuser is to slow the high speed, highly compressed, air from the [[Gas compressor|compressor]] to a velocity optimal for the combustor. Reducing the velocity results in an unavoidable loss in total pressure, so one of the design challenges is to limit the loss of pressure as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, Heiser, and Pratt, p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the diffuser must be designed to limit the flow distortion as much as possible by avoiding flow effects like [[boundary layer separation]]. Like most other gas turbine engine components, the diffuser is designed to be as short and light as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson and Blazowski, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--possible add text about curved wall vs. dump diffusers?--&gt; 
;{{vanchor |Liner}}
The liner contains the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling, see ''Air flow paths'' below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be designed and built to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from [[superalloy]]s like [[Hastelloy|Hastelloy X]]. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow.&lt;ref name=Mattingly760&gt;Mattingly, p. 760.&lt;/ref&gt; Some combustors also make use of [[thermal barrier coating]]s. However, air cooling is still required. In general, there are two main types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 [[kelvin]]s (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a [[Porous medium|porous]] material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of cooling air required. Transpiration cooling results in a much more even temperature profile, as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less cooling air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling). Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, Heiser, and Pratt, pp. 372–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson and Blazowski, pp. 124–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
;{{vanchor |Snout}}
The snout is an extension of the dome (see below) that acts as an air splitter, separating the primary air from the secondary air flows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling air; see ''Air flow paths'' section below).&lt;ref name=HandB124&gt;Henderson and Blazowski, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;
;{{vanchor |Dome}} / {{vanchor |swirler}}
The dome and swirler are the part of the combustor that the primary air (see ''Air flow paths'' below) flows through as it enters the combustion zone. Their role is to generate [[turbulence]] in the flow to rapidly mix the air with fuel.&lt;ref name=Mattingly760/&gt; Early combustors tended to use ''bluff body domes'' (rather than swirlers), which used a simple plate to create [[wake turbulence]] to mix the fuel and air. Most modern designs, however, are ''swirl stabilized'' (use swirlers). The swirler establishes a local low pressure zone that forces some of the combustion products to recirculate, creating the high turbulence.&lt;ref name=HandB124/&gt; However, the higher the turbulence, the higher the pressure loss will be for the combustor, so the dome and swirler must be carefully designed so as not to generate more turbulence than is needed to sufficiently mix the fuel and air.&lt;ref&gt;Flack, p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; 
;{{vanchor |Fuel injector}}
[[File:Cannular combustor on a Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D turbofan.jpg|thumb|Fuel injectors of a cannular combustor on a [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D]] turbofan]]
The fuel injector is responsible for introducing fuel to the combustion zone and, along with the swirler (above), is responsible for mixing the fuel and air. There are four primary types of fuel injectors; pressure-atomizing, air blast, vaporizing, and premix/prevaporizing injectors.&lt;ref name=Mattingly760/&gt; Pressure atomizing fuel injectors rely on high fuel pressures (as much as {{convert|500|psi|order=flip}}) to atomize&lt;ref group="nb" name="note1"&gt;While '''atomize''' has several definitions, in this context it means to form a fine spray. It is not meant to imply that the fuel is being broken down to its atomic components.&lt;/ref&gt; the fuel. This type of fuel injector has the advantage of being very simple, but it has several disadvantages. The fuel system must be robust enough to withstand such high pressures, and the fuel tends to be [[heterogeneous]]ly atomized, resulting in incomplete or uneven combustion which has more pollutants and smoke.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson and Blazowski, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MHB379&gt;Mattingly, Heiser, and Pratt, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second type of fuel injector is the air blast injector. This injector "blasts" a sheet of fuel with a stream of air, atomizing the fuel into homogeneous droplets. This type of fuel injector led to the first smokeless combustors. The air used is just same amount of the primary air (see ''Air flow paths'' below) that is diverted through the injector, rather than the swirler. This type of injector also requires lower fuel pressures than the pressure atomizing type.&lt;ref  name=MHB379/&gt;

The vaporizing fuel injector, the third type, is similar to the air blast injector in that primary air is mixed with the fuel as it is injected into the combustion zone. However, the fuel-air mixture travels through a tube within the combustion zone. Heat from the combustion zone is transferred to the fuel-air mixture, vaporizing some of the fuel (mixing it better) before it is combusted. This method allows the fuel to be combusted with less [[thermal radiation]], which helps protect the liner. However, the vaporizer tube may have serious durability problems with low fuel flow within it (the fuel inside of the tube protects the tube from the combustion heat).&lt;ref&gt;Henderson and Blazowski, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

The premixing/prevaporizing injectors work by mixing or vaporizing the fuel before it reaches the combustion zone. This method allows the fuel to be very uniformly mixed with the air, reducing emissions from the engine. One disadvantage of this method is that fuel may auto-ignite or otherwise combust before the fuel-air mixture reaches the combustion zone. If this happens the combustor can be seriously damaged.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson and Blazowski, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

;{{vanchor |Igniter}}
Most igniters in gas turbine applications are electrical spark igniters, similar to [[Spark plug|automotive spark plugs]]. The igniter needs to be in the combustion zone where the fuel and air are already mixed, but it needs to be far enough upstream so that it is not damaged by the combustion itself. Once the combustion is initially started by the igniter, it is self-sustaining and the igniter is no longer used.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, Heiser, and Pratt, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; In can-annular and annular combustors (see ''Types of combustors'' below), the flame can propagate from one combustion zone to another, so igniters are not needed at each one. In some systems ignition-assist techniques are used. One such method is oxygen injection, where oxygen is fed to the ignition area, helping the fuel easily combust. This is particularly useful in some aircraft applications where the engine may have to restart at high altitude.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson and Blazowski, pp. 129–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air flow paths===
[[File:Combustor diagram airflow.png|frameless|border|upright=2|right]]
;Primary air
This is the main combustion air. It is highly compressed air from the high-pressure compressor (often decelerated via the diffuser) that is fed through the main channels in the dome of the combustor and the first set of liner holes. This air is mixed with fuel, and then combusted.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson and Blazowski, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Intermediate air
Intermediate air is the air injected into the combustion zone through the second set of liner holes (primary air goes through the first set). This air completes the reaction processes, cooling the air down and diluting the high concentrations of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=HandB111&gt;Henderson and Blazowski, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;
;Dilution air
Dilution air is airflow injected through holes in the liner at the end of the combustion chamber to help cool the air to before it reaches the turbine stages. The air is carefully used to produce the uniform temperature profile desired in the combustor. However, as turbine blade technology improves, allowing them to withstand higher temperatures, dilution air is used less, allowing the use of more combustion air.&lt;ref name=HandB111/&gt;
;Cooling air
Cooling air is airflow that is injected through small holes in the liner to generate a layer (film) of cool air to protect the liner from the combustion temperatures. The implementation of cooling air has to be carefully designed so it does not directly interact with the combustion air and process. In some cases, as much as 50% of the inlet air is used as cooling air. There are several different methods of injecting this cooling air, and the method can influence the temperature profile that the liner is exposed to (see ''Liner'', above).&lt;ref&gt;Henderson and Blazowski, pp. 111, 125–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:CanCombustor.svg|thumb|right|Arrangement of can-type combustors for a gas turbine engine, looking axis on, through the exhaust. The blue indicates cooling flow path, the orange indicates the combustion product flow path.]]

===Can===
Can combustors are self-contained cylindrical combustion chambers. Each "can" has its own fuel injector, igniter, liner, and casing.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;Benson, Tom. [http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/burner.html Combustor-Burner]. NASA Glenn Research Center. Last Updated 11 Jul 2008. Accessed 6 Jan 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary air from the compressor is guided into each individual can, where it is decelerated, mixed with fuel, and then ignited. The secondary air also comes from the compressor, where it is fed outside of the liner (inside of which is where the combustion is taking place). The secondary air is then fed, usually through slits in the liner, into the combustion zone to cool the liner via thin film cooling.&lt;ref&gt;Flack, p. 442.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most applications, multiple cans are arranged around the central axis of the engine, and their shared exhaust is fed to the turbine(s). Can type combustors were most widely used in early gas turbine engines, owing to their ease of design and testing (one can test a single can, rather than have to test the whole system). Can type combustors are easy to maintain, as only a single can needs to be removed, rather than the whole combustion section. Most modern gas turbine engines (particularly for aircraft applications) do not use can combustors, as they often weigh more than alternatives. Additionally, the pressure drop across the can is generally higher than other combustors (on the order of 7%). Most modern engines that use can combustors are [[turboshafts]] featuring [[centrifugal compressor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Flack, pp. 442–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson and Blazowski, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cannular===
[[File:CanAnnularCombustor.svg|thumb|right|Cannular combustor for a gas turbine engine, viewing axis on, through the exhaust]]

The next type of combustor is the ''cannular'' combustor; the term is a [[portmanteau]] of "can annular". Like the can type combustor, can annular combustors have discrete combustion zones contained in separate liners with their own fuel injectors. Unlike the can combustor, all the combustion zones share a common ring (annulus) casing. Each combustion zone no longer has to serve as a pressure vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, Heiser, and Pratt, pp. 377–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The combustion zones can also "communicate" with each other via liner holes or connecting tubes that allow some air to flow circumferentially. The exit flow from the cannular combustor generally has a more uniform temperature profile, which is better for the turbine section. It also eliminates the need for each chamber to have its own igniter. Once the fire is lit in one or two cans, it can easily spread to and ignite the others. This type of combustor is  also lighter than the can type, and has a lower pressure drop (on the order of 6%). However, a cannular combustor can be more difficult to maintain than a can combustor.&lt;ref&gt;Flack, pp. 442–4.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a gas turbine engine utilizing a cannular combustor is the [[General Electric J79]] The Pratt &amp; Whitney [[JT8D]] and the [[Rolls-Royce RB.183 Tay|Rolls-Royce Tay]] [[turbofans]] use this type of combustor as well.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson and Blazowski, pp. 106–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Annular===
[[File:AnnularCombustor.svg|thumb|right|Annular combustor for a gas turbine engine, viewed axis on looking through the exhaust. The small orange circles are the fuel injection nozzles.]]

The final, and most commonly used type of combustor is the fully annular combustor.  Annular combustors do away with the separate combustion zones and simply have a continuous liner and casing in a ring (the annulus). There are many advantages to annular combustors, including more uniform combustion, shorter size (therefore lighter), and less surface area.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson and Blazowski, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, p. 757.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, annular combustors tend to have very uniform exit temperatures. They also have the lowest pressure drop of the three designs (on the order of 5%).&lt;ref&gt;Flack, p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt; The annular design is also simpler, although testing generally requires a full size test rig. An engine that uses an annular combustor is the [[CFM International CFM56]]. Almost all of the modern gas turbine engines use annular combustors; likewise, most combustor research and development focuses on improving this type. 
;Double annular combustor
One variation on the standard annular combustor is the ''double annular combustor'' (DAC). Like an annular combustor, the DAC is a continuous ring without separate combustion zones around the radius. The difference is that the combustor has two combustion zones around the ring; a pilot zone and a main zone. The pilot zone acts like that of a single annular combustor, and is the only zone operating at low power levels. At high power levels, the main zone is used as well, increasing air and mass flow through the combustor. GE's implementation of this type of combustor focuses on reducing NOx and CO2 emissions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfm56.com/press/news/cfms+advanced+double+annular+combustor+technology/198?page_index=23 CFM'S Advanced Double Annular Combustor Technology] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120728235534/http://www.cfm56.com/press/news/cfms+advanced+double+annular+combustor+technology/198?page_index=23 |date=2012-07-28 }}.

Extending the same principles as the double annular combustor, triple annular and "multiple annular" combustors have been proposed and even patented.&lt;ref&gt;Ekstedt, Edward E., et al (1994). {{US patent|5323604}} Triple annular combustor for gas turbine engine].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schilling, Jan C., et al (1997). {{US patent|5630319}} Dome assembly for a multiple annular combustor].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emissions==
One of the driving factors in modern gas turbine design is reducing emissions, and the combustor is the primary contributor to a gas turbine's emissions. Generally speaking, there are five major types of emissions from gas turbine engines: smoke, [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[carbon monoxide]] (CO), unburned [[hydrocarbons]] (UHC), and [[nitrogen oxides]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="reg"&gt;Verkamp, F. J., Verdouw, A. J., Tomlinson, J. G. (1974). Impact of Emission Regulations on Future Gas Turbine Engine Combustors. ''Journal of Aircraft''. June 1974. Vol. 11, No. 6. pp. 340–344.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reduct"&gt;Sturgess, G.J., and Zelina, J., Shouse D. T., Roquemore, W.M. (2005). [http://pdf.aiaa.org/getfile.cfm?urlX=%2C%3CWI%277D%2FQKS%2B-S%20OA%0A&amp;urla=%25*RH.%22%40%2C%20%0A&amp;urlb=!*%20%20%20%0A&amp;urlc=!*0%20%20%0A&amp;urld=%27*%22%5C.%23%40.FWP%20%20%0A&amp;urle=%27*%22D.%23%202GU%40%20%20%0A Emissions Reduction Technologies for Military Gas Turbine Engines]. ''Journal of Propulsion and Power''. March–April 2005. Vol. 21, No. 2. pp. 193–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smoke is primarily mitigated by more evenly mixing the fuel with air. As discussed in the fuel injector section above, modern fuel injectors (such as airblast fuel injectors) evenly atomize the fuel and eliminate local pockets of high fuel concentration. Most modern engines use these types of fuel injectors and are essentially smokeless.&lt;ref name="reg"/&gt;

Carbon dioxide is a [[Product (chemistry)|product]] of the [[combustion]] process, and it is primarily mitigated by reducing fuel usage. On average, 1&amp;nbsp;kg of jet fuel burned produces 3.2&amp;nbsp;kg of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Carbon dioxide emissions will continue to drop as manufacturers make gas turbine engines more efficient.&lt;ref name="reduct"/&gt;

Unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions are highly related. UHCs are essentially fuel that was not completely combusted, and UHCs are mostly produced at low power levels (where the engine is not burning all the fuel).&lt;ref name="reduct"/&gt; Much of the UHC content reacts and forms CO within the combustor, which is why the two types of emissions are heavily related. As a result of this close relation, a combustor that is well optimized for CO emissions is inherently well optimized for UHC emissions, so most design work focuses on CO emissions.&lt;ref name="reg"/&gt;

Carbon monoxide is an intermediate product of combustion, and it is eliminated by [[oxidation]]. CO and [[Hydroxyl radical|OH]] react to form CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[Hydrogen|H]]. This process, which consumes the CO, requires a relatively long time ("relatively" is used because the combustion process happens incredibly quickly), high temperatures, and high pressures. This fact means that a low CO combustor has a long ''residence time'' (essentially the amount of time the gases are in the combustion chamber).&lt;ref name="reg"/&gt;

Like CO, Nitrogen oxides (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) are produced in the combustion zone. However, unlike CO, it is most produced during the conditions that CO is most consumed (high temperature, high pressure, long residence time). This means that, in general, reducing CO emissions results in an increase in NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and vice versa. This fact means that most successful emission reductions require the combination of several methods.&lt;ref name="reg"/&gt; 
&lt;!--Is this enough, or should the article dive into the nitty-gritty of emissions reduction?--&gt;

==Afterburners==
{{Main|Afterburner}}
An afterburner (or reheat) is an additional component added to some [[jet engine]]s, primarily those on military [[supersonic]] aircraft. Its purpose is to provide a temporary increase in [[thrust]], both for supersonic flight and for takeoff (as the high [[wing loading]] typical of supersonic aircraft designs means that take-off speed is very high).  On [[military aircraft]] the extra thrust is also useful for [[aerial combat|combat]] situations.  This is achieved by injecting additional [[Jet fuel|fuel]] into the jet pipe downstream of (i.e. ''after'') the [[turbine]] and combusting it.  The advantage of afterburning is significantly increased thrust; the disadvantage is its very high fuel consumption and inefficiency, though this is often regarded as acceptable for the short periods during which it is usually used.

Jet engines are referred to as operating ''wet'' when afterburning is being used and ''dry'' when the engine is used without afterburning. An engine producing maximum thrust wet is at ''maximum power'' or ''max reheat'' (this is the maximum power the engine can produce); an engine producing maximum thrust dry is at ''military power'' or ''max dry''.

As with the main combustor in a gas turbine, the afterburner has both a case and a liner, serving the same purpose as their main combustor counterparts. One major difference between a main combustor and an afterburner is that the temperature rise is not constrained by a turbine section, therefore afterburners tend to have a much higher temperature rise than main combustors.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, pp. 770–1.&lt;/ref&gt; Another difference is that afterburners are not designed to mix fuel as well as primary combustors, so not all the fuel is burned within the afterburner section.&lt;ref&gt;Flack, pp. 445–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterburners also often require the use of [[Flame holder|flameholders]] to keep the velocity of the air in the afterburner from blowing the flame out. These are often bluff bodies or "vee-gutters" directly behind the fuel injectors that create localized low speed flow in the same manner the dome does in the main combustor.&lt;ref&gt;Mattingly, p. 747.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ramjets==
{{Main|Ramjet}}
[[Ramjet]] engines differ in many ways from traditional gas turbine engines, but most of the same principles hold. One major difference is the lack of rotating machinery (a turbine) after the combustor. The combustor exhaust is directly fed to a nozzle. This allows ramjet combustors to burn at a higher temperature. Another difference is that many ramjet combustors do not use liners like gas turbine combustors do. Furthermore, some ramjet combustors are ''dump combustors'' rather than a more conventional type. Dump combustors inject fuel and rely on recirculation generated by a large change in area in the combustor (rather than swirlers in many gas turbine combustors).&lt;ref name="fh"&gt;Stull, F. D. and Craig, R. R. (1975). Investigation of Dump Combustors with Flameholders. ''13th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting''. Pasadena, CA. 20–22 January 1975. AIAA 75-165&lt;/ref&gt; That said, many ramjet combustors are also similar to traditional gas turbine combustors, such as the combustor in the ramjet used by the [[RIM-8 Talos]] missile, which used a can-type combustor.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;Waltrup, P.J. and White M.E., Zarlingo F., Gravlin E. S. (2002). [http://pdf.aiaa.org/downloads/1996/1996_3152.pdf History of U.S. Navy Ramjet, Scramjet, and Mixed-Cycle Propulsion Development]. ''Journal of Propulsion and Power''. Vol. 18, No. 1, January–February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scramjets==
[[File:ScramjetDiagram.gif|thumb|right|upright=2.0|Diagram illustrating a scramjet engine. Notice the isolator section between the compression inlet and combustion chamber. (Illustration from [[The Hy-V Scramjet Flight Experiment]].)]]
{{Main|Scramjet}}

[[Scramjet]] (''[[supersonic]] [[combustion]] [[ramjet]]'') engines present a much different situation for the combustor than conventional gas turbine engines (scramjets are not gas turbines, they generally have few or no moving parts). While scramjet combustors may be physically quite different from conventional combustors, they face many of the same design challenges, like fuel mixing and flame holding. However, as its name implies, a scramjet combustor must address these challenges in a [[supersonic]] flow environment. For example, for a scramjet flying at [[Mach number|Mach]] 5, the air flow entering the combustor would nominally be Mach 2. One of the major challenges in a scramjet engine is preventing [[shock waves]] generated by combustor from traveling upstream into the inlet. If that were to happen, the engine may [[unstart]], resulting in loss of thrust, amongst other problems. To prevent this, scramjet engines tend to have an isolator section (see image) immediately ahead of the combustion zone.&lt;ref name="hyv"&gt;Goyne, C. P., Hall, C. D., O'Brian, W. F., and Schetz, J. A. (2006). [http://pdf.aiaa.org/preview/CDReadyMHYP06_1276/PV2006_7901.pdf ''The Hy-V Scramjet Flight Experiment'']. 14th AIAA/AHI Space Planes and Hypersonic Systems and Technologies Conference.

A '''concrete shell''', also commonly called ''thin shell concrete structure'', is a structure composed of a relatively thin shell of [[concrete]], usually with no interior [[column]]s or exterior [[buttress]]es. The shells are most commonly flat plates and [[dome]]s, but may also take the form of [[ellipsoid]]s or [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] sections, or some combination thereof. The first concrete shell dates back to the 2nd century.

==Uses==
Most concrete shell structures are buildings, including storage facilities, commercial buildings, and residential homes. Concrete shell construction techniques are well suited for complex curves and are also used to build [[hull (watercraft)|boat hulls]] (called ''ferroconcrete''). Historically, it was used by the British to create the [[Mulberry Harbour]]s for the 1944 [[D-Day]] invasion of [[Normandy]].

==Advantages==
Like the [[arch]], the curved shapes often used for concrete shells are naturally strong structures, allowing wide areas to be spanned without the use of internal supports, giving an open, unobstructed interior. The use of concrete as a building material reduces both materials cost and construction costs, as concrete is relatively inexpensive and easily cast into compound curves. The resulting structure may be immensely strong and safe; modern [[monolithic dome]] houses, for example, have resisted [[hurricane]]s and fires, and are widely considered to be strong enough to withstand even F5 [[tornado]]es.

==Disadvantages==
Since concrete is a porous material, concrete domes often have issues with sealing. If not treated, rainwater can seep through the roof and leak into the interior of the building. On the other hand, the seamless construction of concrete domes prevents air from escaping, and can lead to buildup of condensation on the inside of the shell. Shingling or sealants are common solutions to the problem of exterior moisture, and [[dehumidifier]]s or ventilation can address condensation.

==Historic concrete shells==
The oldest known concrete shell, the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon in Rome]], was completed about AD 125, and is still standing. It has a massive concrete dome 43m in diameter, with an oculus at its centre. A monolithic structure, it appears to have been sculpted in place by applying thin layers on top of each other in decreasing diameter. Massively thick at the bottom and thinning (with aerated volcanic pumice as part of the concrete mix) at the top, the Pantheon is a remarkable feat of engineering.

==Modern concrete shell construction==
Modern thin concrete shells, which began to appear in the 1920s, are made from thin [[steel]] reinforced concrete, and in many cases lack any ribs or additional reinforcing structures, relying wholly on the shell structure itself.  

Shells may be cast in place, or pre-cast off site and moved into place and assembled. The strongest form of shell is the monolithic shell, which is cast as a single unit. The most common monolithic form is the dome, but ellipsoids and cylinders (resembling concrete [[Quonset hut]]s / [[Nissen hut]]s) are also possible using similar construction methods.

[[Geodesic dome]]s may be constructed from concrete sections, or may be constructed of a lightweight foam with a layer of concrete applied over the top. The advantage of this method is that each section of the dome is small and easily handled. The layer of concrete applied to the outside bonds the dome into a semi-monolithic structure.

Monolithic domes are cast in one piece out of reinforced concrete and date back to the 1960s. Advocates of these domes consider them to be cost-effective and durable structures, especially suitable for areas prone to natural disasters. They also point out the ease of maintenance of these buildings. Monolithic domes can be built as homes, office buildings, or for other purposes.

Completed in 1963, the [[Assembly Hall (Champaign)|University of Illinois Assembly Hall]], located in Champaign, Illinois was and is the first ever concrete-domed arena. The design of the new building, by Max Abramovitz, called for the construction of one of the world’s largest edge-supported structures. See [[Construction of Assembly Hall (Champaign)|Construction of Assembly Hall]].

The [[Seattle Kingdome]] was the world's first (and only) concrete-domed multi-purpose stadium. It was completed in 1976 and demolished in 2000. The Kingdome was constructed of triangular segments of [[reinforced concrete]] that were cast in place. Thick ribs provide additional support.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1894">'''D/Vision Pro''' was one of the earliest [[Non-linear editing system]]s that was marketed. It was released by TouchVision Systems, Inc. in the mid-1990s.

The Program was [[DOS]] based and worked on either the [[Intel 80386|386]] or [[Intel 80486|486]] [[Intel]] processors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xGbxw6wihQ4C&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=D/Vision+Pro++Touchvision+Systems&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kcwp3C-2Bp&amp;sig=UAkYq1-T6I9ODnyylbF0u-FES6U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TlzpUtPTDaXesASo1oKADg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=D%2FVision%20Pro%20%20Touchvision%20Systems&amp;f=false Digital Filmmaking: The Changing Art and Craft of Making Motion Pictures]&lt;/ref&gt; The system used the [[Digital Video Interactive|AVI]] compression system and worked on an [[Action Media II]] board.

The system allowed users to digitize video, audio and time code, create an editing [[Edit decision list|EDL]], instantly play back the edited program and out put the finished EDL in a wide variety of formats.&lt;ref&gt;D/Vision Pro 2.2 User Manual&lt;/ref&gt;

These systems were used as a cost-effective editing choice by numerous independent filmmakers and low budget productions during the mid-late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moviemaker.com/articles-in-gear/dvision-pro-3127/ D/VISION PRO]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.videomaker.com/article/1575-desktop-video-digital-nonlinear-editing Desktop Video: Digital Nonlinear Editing]&lt;/ref&gt;

Low quality compression led TouchVision (later renamed D/Vision Systems) to abandon this system in favor of the [[D/Vision Online]] program, which later became [[Discreet Logic Edit*]].

This was after it was purchased by Discreet. Eventually Discreet Killed off Edit* as they did not want it to interfere with Smoke* Sales which were more profitable. 

Later Discreet was purchased by Autodesk.

'''Desanders''' and '''desilters''' are solid control equipment with a set of [[hydrocyclone]]s that separate [[sand]] and [[silt]] from the [[drilling fluids]] in [[Drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rigs]]. Desanders are installed on top of the mud tank following the [[shale shaker]] and the [[degasser]], but before the desilter. Desander removes the abrasive solids from the [[drilling fluids]] which cannot be removed by shakers. Normally the solids diameter for desander to be separated would be 45~74μm, and 15~44μm for desilter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aipusolidcontrol.com/html/products/shale-shaker-screen.html|title=Shale Shaker Screen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[centrifugal pump]] is used to pump the [[drilling fluids]] from mud tank into the set of [[hydrocyclone]]s.

==Solids control==
Desanders have no  moving parts. The larger the internal diameter of the desander is, the greater the amount of drilling fluids it is able to process and the larger the size of the solids removed. A desander with a ({{convert|10|in|mm}} cone) is able to remove 50% of solids within the 40-50 μm (micrometre) range at a flow rate of {{convert|500|USgal/min|L/s}}, whilea  desilter ({{convert|4|in|mm}}  Cone) is able to remove 50% of solids within the 15-20 μm range at a flow rate of {{convert|60|USgal/min|L/s}}. Micro-fine separators are able to remove 50% of solids within the 10-15 μm range at a flow rate of {{convert|15|USgal/min|L/s}}. A desander is typically positioned next-to-last in the arrangement of [[solids control]] equipment, with a desander [[centrifuge]] as the subsequent processing unit. Desanders are preceded by gas busters, gumbo removal equipment (if utilized), [[shale shaker]], [[mud cleaner]] (if utilized) and a vacuum degasser. Desanders are widely used in oilfield drilling.
Practice has proved that [[hydrocyclone]] desanders are economic and effective equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aipusolidcontrol.com/html/products/desander.html|title=Desander for solids control in many fields|publisher=Aipu solids}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4841">{{About|The general term 'digital locker'}}
A '''digital locker''' or '''cyberlocker''' is an online file or digital media storage service.  Files stored include music, videos, movies, games and other media.&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite web|title=digital locker|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/digital-locker|website=Oxford Dictionary|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wisegeek&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is a Digital Locker?|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-digital-locker.htm|website=wiseGEEK|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was used by Microsoft as a part of its [[Windows Marketplace]] in 2004.&lt;ref name=wisegeek /&gt; By storing files in a digital locker, users are able to access them anywhere they can find internet connections. Most (but not all) digital locker services require a user to register. Prices range from free to paid, and various combinations thereof. 
==Uses==
Digital lockers, as opposed to simple file storage services, are typically associated with [[Digital distribution]] — a commercial store where you can buy content such as [[Steam (software)| Steam]], [[Google Play]], [[Amazon.com |Amazon]], and [[iTunes]].

'''Download / Play / Watch''' 
 
Digital locker services often come with integrated client software that allow users to play the movies or games or songs.&lt;ref name=steam&gt;{{cite web|title=10 obscure Steam features that can power up your PC gaming|url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/2600209/master-steam-10-powerful-tips-and-tricks-for-pc-gamings-do-it-all-vanguard.html |website= PC world|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Upload'''

Many digital locker services enable users to upload their own content or provide 'sync' management software that will scan a user's computer and upload the appropriate media for them.&lt;ref name=verge-gplay&gt;{{cite web|last = Ingraham |first =Nathan|title=Google Play Music finally lets you upload songs through the browser|url = https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/26/5549494/google-play-music-finally-lets-you-upload-songs-through-the-browser | website =The Verge|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matching'''

Some services like Google Play and iTunes will match songs users have to a digital signature, allowing them to skip the sometimes slow process of uploading the media file.  Rather, once the song is matched, it will just be added to a user's library.&lt;ref name=macworld-itunes-match&gt;{{cite web|title=Is iTunes Match right for you?|url = http://www.macworld.com/article/2099340/is-itunes-match-right-for-you.html|website=Macworld|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes-goog-match&gt;{{cite web|last =Evangelho|first =Jason| title= Google Play Adds Free Music Matching Feature, 320k Cloud Streaming|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2012/12/19/google-play-adds-music-matching-feature-320k-cloud-streaming/ |website=Forbes|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital Rights Management==
Digital lockers are often used as a way of controlling access to media via [[Digital Rights Management]].  Services such as Steam, Origin, Blizzard, Vudu, and others offer to users the convenience of a digital locker in exchange for the control of DRM.&lt;ref name=engadget-drm&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lawler|first1=Richard|title=DECE's 'digital locker' take-anywhere DRM dubbed UltraViolet, launches later this year|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/07/20/deces-digital-locker-take-anywhere-drm-dubbed-ultraviolet/|website=engadget|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright Infringement==
Some digital locker services such as [[Hotfile]] and [[MegaUpload]] have been accused of being large contributors towards copyright infringement.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|title=Hotfile's digital locker service targeted by Hollywood|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-17300225|website=BBC News|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[MPAA]] alleged that Hotfile and similar services promote copyright infringement by paying users referral fees, and thus encouraging them to upload popular copyrighted content.&lt;ref name=mediapost&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Wendy|title=MPAA Argues Hotfile Liable For Users' Copyright Infringement|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/169581/mpaa-argues-hotfile-liable-for-users-copyright-in.html|website=MediaPost|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Direct Fusion Drive''' ('''DFD''') is a conceptual low radioactivity, nuclear-fusion engine designed to produce both thrust and electric power for interplanetary spacecraft. The concept is  based on the [[Princeton field-reversed configuration experiment|Princeton field-reversed configuration reactor]] invented in 2002 by Samuel A. Cohen, and is being modeled and experimentally tested at [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]], a US Department of Energy facility, and modeled and evaluated by Princeton Satellite Systems. As of 2018, the concept has moved on to Phase II to further advance the design.

==Principle==

The Direct Fusion Drive (DFD) is a conceptual fusion-powered spacecraft engine, named for its ability to produce thrust from fusion without going through an intermediary electricity-generating step. The DFD uses a novel magnetic confinement and heating system, fueled with a mixture of [[helium-3]] (He-3) and [[deuterium]] (D), to produce a high specific power, variable thrust and specific impulse, and a low-radiation spacecraft propulsion system.&lt;ref name='PSS'&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170003126.pdf Fusion-Enabled Pluto Orbiter and Lander - Phase I Final Report]. (PDF) Stephanie Thomas, Princeton Satellite Systems. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Fusion happens when [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]], comprising one species in a hot (100 keV or 1,120,000,00 K) [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], a collection of electrically charged particles that includes electrons and ions, join [[Nuclear fusion|(or fuse)]] together, releasing enormous amounts of energy. In the DFD system, the plasma is confined in a torus-like magnetic field inside of a linear solenoidal coil and is heated by a rotating magnetic field to fusion temperatures.&lt;ref name='PSS'/&gt; Bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation emitted from the plasma are captured and converted to electricity for communications, spacecraft station-keeping, and maintaining the plasma's temperature.&lt;ref name='Astronautica 2014'&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576514003154 ]. Yosef S. Razin, Gary Pajer, Mary Breton, Eric Ham, Joseph Mueller, Michael Paluszek, Alan H. Glasser, Samuel A. Cohen. ''Acta Astronautica''. Volume 105, Issue 1, December 2014, Pages 145-155. {{doi|10.1016/j.actaastro.2014.08.008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This design uses a specially shaped [[radio wave]]s (RF) "antenna" to heat the plasma.&lt;ref name='Time 2013'&gt;[http://www.psatellite.com/direct-fusion-drive-quad-chart/ Direct Fusion Drive Quad Chart]. Princeton Satellite Systems. Accessed: 18 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The design also includes a rechargeable battery or a [[deuterium]]-oxygen auxiliary power unit to startup or restart DFD.&lt;ref name='PSS'/&gt;

The captured radiated energy heats to {{conv|1500|K|C F}} a He-Xe fluid that flows outside the plasma in a boron-containing structure. That energy is put through a closed-loop [[Brayton cycle]] generator to transform it into electricity for use in energizing the coils,
powering the RF heater, charging the battery, communications, and station-keeping functions.&lt;ref name='PSS'/&gt; Adding propellant to the edge plasma flow results in a variable [[thrust]] and specific impulse when channeled and accelerated through a [[magnetic nozzle]]; this flow of momentum past the nozzle is predominantly carried by  the [[ion]]s as they expand through the magnetic nozzle and beyond, and thus, function as an [[ion thruster]].&lt;ref name='PSS'/&gt;

==Development==

The construction of the experimental research device and most of its early operations were funded by the US Department of Energy. The recent studies —Phase I and Phase II— are funded by the [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]] (NIAC) program.&lt;ref name='Time 2013'/&gt; A series of articles on the concept were published between 2001 and 2008; the first experimental results were reported in 2007. Numerous studies of spacecraft missions (Phase I) were published, beginning in 2012. In 2017 the team reported that "Studies of electron heating with this method have surpassed theoretical predictions, and experiments to measure ion heating in the second-generation machine are ongoing."&lt;ref name='PSS'/&gt; As of 2018, the concept has moved on to Phase II to further advance the design.&lt;ref name='NASA News'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Phase II'/&gt; The full-size unit would measure approximately 2 m in diameter and 10 m long.&lt;ref name='Brown'&gt;[https://brownspaceman.com/direct-fusion-drive/ How Direct Fusion Drive (DFD) will Revolutionize Space Travel]. Zain Husain, ''Brownpaceman''. 1 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Princeton Satellite Systems.  Accessed 18 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projected performance==

Analyses predict that the Direct Fusion Drive would produce between 5-10 [[Newton (unit)|Newtons]]&lt;ref name='PSS'/&gt; thrust per each [[Watt|MW]] of generated fusion power,&lt;ref name='Phase II'&gt;[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2018-4769 Nuclear and Future Flight Propulsion - Modeling the Thrust of the Direct Fusion Drive]. Stephanie J. Thomas, Michael Paluszek, Samuel A. Cohen, Alexander Glasser. ''2018 Joint Propulsion Conference'', Cincinnati, Ohio. {{doi|10.2514/6.2018-4769}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a [[specific impulse]] (I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;) of about 10,000 seconds and 200 kW available as electrical power.&lt;ref name='NASA News'/&gt;  Approximately 35% of the fusion power goes to thrust, 30% to electric power, 25% lost to heat, and 10% is recirculated for the RF heating.&lt;ref name='PSS'/&gt;  

Modeling shows that this technology can potentially propel a spacecraft with a mass of about {{convert|1000|kg|abbr=on}} to [[Pluto]] in 4 years.&lt;ref name='NASA News'/&gt; Since DFD provides power as well as propulsion in one integrated device, it would also provide as much as 2 MW of power to the payloads upon arrival, expanding options for instrument selection, [[Laser communication in space|laser/optical communications]],&lt;ref name='PSS'/&gt;&lt;ref name='NASA News'/&gt; and even transfer up to 50 kW of power from the orbiter to the lander through a [[laser]] beam operating at 1080 nm wavelength.&lt;ref name='PSS'/&gt;

The designers think that this technology can radically expand the science capability of planetary missions.&lt;ref name='NASA News'/&gt; This dual power/propulsion technology has been suggested to be used on a [[Pluto]] orbiter and lander mission,&lt;ref name='PSS'/&gt;&lt;ref name='NASA News'&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2017_Phase_I_Phase_II/Fusion_Enabled_Pluto_Orbiter_and_Lander| title=Fusion-Enabled Pluto Orbiter and Lander| last=Hall| first=Loura| date=April 5, 2017| work=NASA| access-date=July 14, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; a well as integration on the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion spacecraft]] to transport a [[Human mission to Mars|crewed mission to Mars]] in a relatively short time&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psatellite.com/direct-fusion-drive-to-mars-a-fiso-talk/ Direct Fusion Drive to Mars – A FISO Talk].

In June 2014, Dropcam was acquired by Nest Labs and in September, Dropcam joined the Works with Nest program. When the Nest Protect alarm goes off, Dropcam records a clip of the smoke or carbon monoxide event and saves it, regardless of whether the customer pays for Cloud Recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wollerton|first1=Megan|title=Dropcam and Nest products now work together in perfect harmony|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/dropcam-and-nest-products-now-work-together-in-perfect-harmony/|publisher=CNet|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Dropcam will automatically turn on motion alerts based on the Nest Thermostat being set to "Away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buckingham|first1=Alan|title=Nest grows its home automation integration, Dropcam now in use|url=http://betanews.com/2014/09/10/nest-grows-its-home-automation-integration-dropcam-now-in-use/|publisher=Beta News|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cloud Recording==
Dropcam provides optional encrypted digital video recording through the cloud. The Cloud Recording service automatically saves video on a rolling basis, so users can review the past week or month of footage, depending on their plan. All users, with or without the service, can still view the live feed.&lt;ref name=PCMag&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffith|first=Eric|title=Dropcam Pro|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2425539,00.asp|publisher=PC Mag|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dropcam allows users to download the video and create video clips while also allowing for the creation of a public stream. About 40% of Dropcam users sign up for the cloud service.&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;

As part of Dropcam's Cloud Recording service, markers are placed on a user's video timeline when motion or audio is detected, so a user may go back and view those specific events rather than watch the whole feed to search for notable activities.&lt;ref name="PCMag" /&gt; Dropcam introduced a beta version of its Activity Recognition feature for Cloud Recording, which learns typical motion patterns in a user's video stream, allowing for customized motion alerts.&lt;ref name="FastCompany" /&gt;

'''''Eisenia fetida''''' (older spelling: foetida), known under various [[common names]] such as '''redworm''', '''brandling worm''', '''panfish worm''', '''trout worm''', '''tiger worm''', '''red wiggler worm''', '''red Californian earthworm''', etc., is a species of [[earthworm]] adapted to [[Decomposition|decaying]] organic material. These worms thrive in rotting [[vegetation]], [[compost]], and [[manure]]. They are [[epigean]], rarely found in soil. In this trait, they resemble  ''[[Lumbricus rubellus]]''.

They have groups of bristles (called [[seta]]e) on each segment that move in and out to grip nearby surfaces as the worms stretch and contract their muscles to push themselves forward or backward.

''E. fetida'' worms are used for [[vermicomposting]] of both domestic and industrial organic waste.&lt;ref name="Albanell1988"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Albanell | first1 = E. | last2 = Plaixats | first2 = J. | last3 = Cabrero | first3 = T. | title = Chemical changes during vermicomposting (''Eisenia fetida'') of sheep manure mixed with cotton industrial wastes | journal = Biology and Fertility of Soils | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | year = 1988 | issn = 0178-2762 | doi = 10.1007/BF00260823}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orozco1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Orozco | first1 = F.

==Odor==
When roughly handled, a redworm exudes a [[pungent]] liquid, thus the specific name ''foetida'' meaning "[[wikt:fetid|foul-smelling]]". This is presumably an [[antipredator adaptation]].

[[File:Eisenia_fetida_HC1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Close-up of ''E. fetida'' with visible bristles]]

==Related species==
''E. fetida'' is closely related to ''[[Eisenia andrei|E. andrei]]'', also referred to as ''E. f. andrei''. The only simple way of distinguishing the two species is that ''E. fetida'' is sometimes lighter in colour. Molecular analyses have confirmed their identity as separate species, and breeding experiments have shown that they do not produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s.

==Reproduction==
As with other [[earthworm]] species, ''E. fetida'' is hermaphroditic. However, two worms are still required for reproduction. The two worms join [[clitella]], the large, lighter-colored bands which contain the worms' reproductive organs, and which are only prominent during the reproduction process. The two worms exchange [[sperm]]. Both worms then secrete cocoons which contain several eggs each. These cocoons are lemon-shaped and are pale yellow at first, becoming more brownish as the worms inside become mature. These cocoons are clearly visible to the naked eye.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1475">The '''Enhanced Telephone''' is a [[telephone]] developed by [[Citibank]] in the late 1980s for customers to do banking and other [[financial transaction]]s from their home. The official launch date was February 26-27, 1990.

The first version of the Enhanced Telephone, the 99A model, was beige and featured a monochrome [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] screen. Because of its chunky appearance, several developers dubbed it the "sawed-off ski boot."&lt;ref name="Computer History - Citibank"&gt;[http://www.kmoser.com/computerhistory/?id=citibank Computer History - Citibank]&lt;/ref&gt; The physical hardware was manufactured by Transaction Technologies Incorporated (TTI).

The second version of the Enhanced Telephone, the P100 model, was manufactured by Philips Electronics and featured an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] screen and more sleek styling. The font was developed by [[Bitstream Inc.]].

Software for the Enhanced Telephone was written in a proprietary language called HAL (Home Application Language).

The Enhanced Telephone ultimately failed to become a viable product because by the time it was introduced, [[home banking]] via PCs was becoming more common. As the [[World Wide Web]] became popular in the early 1990s, the Enhanced Telephone was rendered obsolete.

The [[Philips]] P100 phone lived on and to this day{{Specify}} variations of it are used for other applications.

'''Environmental science''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[academic field]] that integrates physical, biological and [[information science]]s (including [[ecology]], [[biology]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[plant science]], [[zoology]], [[mineralogy]], [[oceanography]], [[limnology]], [[soil science]], [[geology]] and [[physical geography]] ([[geodesy]]), and [[atmospheric science]]) to the study of the environment, and the solution of environmental problems. Environmental science emerged from the fields of [[natural history]] and [[medicine]] during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750-1800|date=2008|publisher=[[Ashgate]]|url=https://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today it provides an integrated, quantitative, and [[interdisciplinary]] approach to the study of [[ecosystem|environmental systems]].&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Science: Iowa State University. Environmental Sciences provides an integrated and interdisciplinary approach to understand and mitigate hazards arising from anthropogenic and natural activities by focusing on key areas of environmental chemistry, earth sciences, environmental engineering, atmospheric sciences, and sustainable systems. http://www.ensci.iastate.edu (Accessed 17 February 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Related areas of study include [[environmental studies]] and [[environmental engineering]].  Environmental studies incorporates more of the social sciences for understanding human relationships, perceptions and policies towards the environment. Environmental engineering focuses on design and technology for improving environmental quality in every aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Environmental engineering|date=2018-08-30|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Environmental_engineering&amp;oldid=857171174|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental scientists work on subjects like the understanding of earth processes, evaluating [[alternative energy]] systems, [[pollution control]] and mitigation, [[natural resource management]], and the [[effects of global warming|effects of global climate change]]. [[Environmental issues]] almost always include an interaction of physical, chemical, and biological processes. Environmental scientists bring a systems approach to the analysis of environmental problems. Key elements of an effective environmental scientist include the ability to relate space, and time relationships as well as quantitative analysis.

Environmental science came alive as a substantive, active field of scientific investigation in the 1960s and 1970s driven by (a) the need for a [[multi-disciplinary]] approach to analyze complex environmental problems, (b) the arrival of substantive environmental laws requiring specific environmental protocols of investigation and (c) the growing public awareness of a need for action in addressing environmental problems. Events that spurred this development included the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s landmark environmental book ''[[Silent Spring]]&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Rachel. ''Silent Spring'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1962), Mariner Books, 2002, {{ISBN|0-618-24906-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' along with major environmental issues becoming very public, such as the [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill]], and the [[Cuyahoga River]] of Cleveland, Ohio, "catching fire" (also in 1969), and helped increase the visibility of environmental issues and create this new field of study.

==Terminology==
{{See also|Glossary of environmental science}}

In common usage, "environmental science" and "ecology" are often used interchangeably, but technically, ecology refers only to the study of organisms and their interactions with each other and their environment. Ecology could be considered a subset of environmental science, which also could involve purely chemical or [[public health]] issues (for example) ecologists would be unlikely to study. In practice, there is considerable overlap between the work of ecologists and other environmental scientists.

The National Center for Education Statistics in the United States defines an academic program in environmental science as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A program that focuses on the application of biological, chemical, and physical principles to the study of the physical environment and the solution of environmental problems, including subjects such as abating or controlling environmental pollution and degradation; the interaction between human society and the natural environment; and natural resources management. Includes instruction in biology, chemistry, physics, geosciences, climatology, statistics, and mathematical modeling.&lt;ref&gt;National Center for Education Statistics. ''[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/cip2000/occupationallookup6d.ASP?CIP=03.0104 Classification of Instructional Programs]''. United States Department of Education, Institute of Education Sciences, 2000. (Accessed 29 January 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Top_of_Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Earth's [[atmosphere]]]]

=== Atmospheric sciences ===
{{Main|Atmospheric sciences}}
Atmospheric sciences focus on the Earth's atmosphere, with an emphasis upon its interrelation to other systems. Atmospheric sciences can include studies of [[meteorological|meteorology]], [[greenhouse gas]] phenomena, [[atmospheric dispersion modeling]] of airborne contaminants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling|edition=2nd|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; sound propagation phenomena related to [[noise pollution]], and even [[light pollution]].

Taking the example of the [[global warming]] phenomena, physicists create [[computer model]]s of atmospheric circulation and [[infra-red radiation]] transmission, chemists examine the inventory of atmospheric chemicals and their reactions, biologists analyze the plant and animal contributions to [[carbon dioxide]] fluxes, and specialists such as [[meteorologist]]s and [[oceanographer]]s add additional breadth in understanding the [[atmospheric dynamics]].

=== Ecology ===
{{Main|Ecology}}
[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|left|[[Biodiversity]] of a coral reef. Corals adapt and modify their environment by forming [[calcium carbonate]] skeletons. This provides growing conditions for future generations and forms a habitat for many other species.]]
Ecology is the study of the interactions between organisms and their environment. Ecologists might investigate the relationship between a population of organisms and some physical characteristic of their environment, such as concentration of a chemical; or they might investigate the interaction between two populations of different organisms through some symbiotic or competitive relationship.

For example, an interdisciplinary analysis of an ecological system which is being impacted by one or more stressors might include several related environmental science fields. In an estuarine setting where a proposed industrial development could impact certain species by [[water pollution|water]] and [[air pollution]], [[biologist]]s would describe the flora and fauna, [[chemist]]s would analyze the transport of [[water pollutant]]s to the marsh, [[physicist]]s would calculate air pollution emissions and [[geologist]]s would assist in understanding the marsh soils and bay muds.

=== Environmental chemistry ===
{{Main|Environmental chemistry}}

Environmental chemistry is the study of chemical alterations in the environment. Principal areas of study include [[soil contamination]] and water pollution. The topics of analysis include chemical degradation in the environment, multi-phase transport of chemicals (for example, evaporation of a [[solvent]] containing lake to yield solvent as an air pollutant), and chemical effects upon [[biota (ecology)|biota]].

As an example study, consider the case of a leaking solvent tank which has entered the habitat soil of an [[endangered species]] of amphibian. As a method to resolve or understand the extent of [[soil contamination]] and subsurface transport of solvent, a [[computer model]] would be implemented. Chemists would then characterize the [[molecular bonding]] of the solvent to the specific soil type, and biologists would study the impacts upon soil [[arthropod]]s, plants, and ultimately pond-dwelling organisms that are the food of the endangered amphibian.

=== Geosciences ===
{{Main|Geosciences}}

Geosciences include [[environmental geology]], [[environmental soil science]], [[volcanic]] phenomena and evolution of the Earth's crust. In some classification systems this can also include [[hydrology]], including [[oceanography]].

As an example study of soils [[erosion]], calculations would be made of [[surface runoff]] by soil scientists. Fluvial geomorphologists would assist in examining [[sediment transport]] in overland flow. Physicists would contribute by assessing the changes in light transmission in the receiving waters. Biologists would analyze subsequent impacts to aquatic flora and fauna from increases in water turbidity.

==Regulations driving the studies==
[[File:Glen Canyon Dam &amp; Lake Powell.jpg|thumb|Environmental science examines the effects of humans on nature ([[Glen Canyon Dam]] in the U.S.)]]
In the U.S. the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA) of 1969 set forth requirements for analysis of major projects in terms of specific environmental criteria. Numerous state laws have echoed these mandates, applying the principles to local-scale actions. The upshot has been an explosion of documentation and study of environmental consequences before the fact of development actions.

One can examine the specifics of environmental science by reading examples of [[Environmental Impact Statement]]s prepared under NEPA  such as: ''Wastewater treatment expansion options discharging into the San Diego/[[Tijuana]] [[Estuary]]'', ''Expansion of the [[San Francisco International Airport]]'', ''Development of the [[Houston]], Metro Transportation system'', ''Expansion of the metropolitan [[Boston]] MBTA transit system'', and ''Construction of [[Interstate 66]] through [[Arlington, Virginia]]''.

In England and Wales the [[Environment Agency]] (EA),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/ Environment Agency&lt;/ref&gt; formed in 1996, is a public body for protecting and improving the environment and enforces the regulations listed on the communities and local government site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1503251] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812001715/http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1503251|date=12 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly the office of the deputy prime minister). The agency was set up under the [[Environment Act 1995]] as an independent body and works closely with UK Government to enforce the regulations.

A '''free license''' or '''open license'''&lt;ref name="opendefinition"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://opensource.org/docs/osd ''The Open Source Definition'']&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[license agreement]] which contains conditions permitted to the user from the holder on a specific list of uses for his work, which gives him [[Four Freedoms (Free software)|four major freedoms]].

Without a special license, these uses are normally prohibited by the laws of [[copyright]].

Most free licenses are worldwide, [[royalty-free]], [[Non-exclusive license|non-exclusive]], and perpetual (see [[List of copyright durations|copyright durations]]).

Free licenses are often the basis of [[crowdsourcing]] and [[crowdfunding]] projects.

The invention of the term "free license" and the focus on the [[rights of users]] were connected to the sharing traditions of the [[hacker culture]] of the 1970s public domain software ecosystem, the social and political [[free software movement]] (since 1980) and the [[Open source movement]] (since the 1990s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twobits.net/pub/Kelty-TwoBits.pdf |title=The Cultural Significance of free Software - Two Bits |first=Christpher M. |last=Kelty |publisher=[[Duke University]] press - durham and london |year=2008 |pages=99 |quote=''Prior to 1998, Free Software referred either to the Free Software Foundation (and the watchful, micromanaging eye of Stallman) or to one of thousands of different commercial, avocational, or university-research projects, processes, licenses, and ideologies that had a variety of names: sourceware, freeware, shareware, open software, public domain software, and so on. The term Open Source, by contrast, sought to encompass them all in one movement.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These rights were codified by different groups and organizations for different domains in [[Free Software Definition]], [[Open Source Definition]], [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]], [[Definition of Free Cultural Works]] and the [[The Open Definition|Open definition]].&lt;ref name="opendefinition"&gt;[http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/ Open Definition 2.1] on opendefinition.org ''"This essential meaning matches that of “open” with respect to software as in the Open Source Definition and is synonymous with “free” or “libre” as in the Free Software Definition and Definition of Free Cultural Works."''&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions were then transformed into licenses, using the [[copyright]] as legal mechanism. Since then, ideas of free/open licenses spread into different spheres of society.

[[Open source movement|Open source]], [[free culture movement|free culture]] (unified as [[Free and open-source software|Free and open-source movement]]), [[anticopyright]], [[Wikimedia Foundation]] projects, [[Public Domain]] advocacy groups and [[pirate parties]] are connected with free and open licenses.

[[File:Platform Diving, 1994.jpg|thumb|Glass mosaics of [[sea turtles]] dive off a [[Houston Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|subway]] platform]]
'''Glass tiles''' are pieces of [[glass]] formed into consistent shapes.

==Early history==
Glass was used in [[mosaic]]s as early as 2500 BC, but it took until the 3rd century BC before innovative artisans in [[Greece]], [[Persian empire|Persia]]  and [[India]] created glass [[tiles]].

Whereas clay tiles are dated as early as 8000 BC, there were significant barriers to the development of glass tiles,  included the high temperatures required to melt glass, and the complexities of mastering various [[annealing (glass)|annealing]] curves for glass.

In recent years, glass tiles have become popular for both field and accent tiles. This trend can be attributed to recent technological breakthroughs, as well as the tiles’ inherent properties, in particular their potential to impart intense color and reflect [[radiance|light]], and their imperviousness to water.

Glass tile introduces complexities to the installer.  Since glass is more rigid than [[ceramic]] or [[porcelain tile]], glass tiles break more readily under the duress of substrate shifts.

==Smalti tiles==
''Smalti tile'', sometimes referred to as ''[[Byzantine]] glass mosaic tile'', are typically opaque glass tiles that were originally developed for use in mosaics created during the time of the [[Byzantine empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/homes-and-gardens/design/small-tiles-big-tales/article5639010.ece | title=Small tiles, big tales | publisher=The Hindu | accessdate=25 September 2015 | author=Govind, Ranjani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smalti is made by mixing molten glass with metal oxides for color in a furnace; the result is a cloudy mixture that is poured into flat slabs that are cooled and broken into individual pieces. The molten mixture can also be topped with gold leaf, followed by a thin glass film to protect against tarnishing. During the Byzantine era, [[Constantinople]] became the center of the mosaic craft, and the use of gold leaf glass mosaic reached perhaps its greatest artistic expression in the former seat of the Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople, the [[Hagia Sophia]].

Traditional smalti tiles are still found today in many European churches and ornamental objects; the method is also used by some present-day artisans, both in installations and fine art. In the 1920s, mass production methods were applied to Smalti tile manufacturing, which enabled these tiles to find their way into many middle-class homes. Instead of the old method of rolling the colored glass mixture out, cooling, and cutting, the new method called for [[molten]] liquid to be poured and cooled in trays, usually resulting in 3/4&amp;nbsp;inch chicklet-type pieces.

==Modern era==
Since the 1990s, a variety of modern glass tile technologies, including methods to take used glass and recreate it as ‘green’ tiles, has resulted in a resurgence of interest in glass tile as a floor and wall cladding. It is now most commonly used in pools, kitchens, spas, and bathrooms. And while smalti tiles are still popular, small and large format glass products are now commonly formed using cast and [[fused glass]] methods. The plasticity of these last two methods has resulted in a wide variety of looks and applications, including [[tile|floor tiles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.mozaico.net/glass-mosaic-artworks/ | title=New Vision of an ancient medium: Glass Mosaic Tiles | publisher=Mozaico | date=10 August 2015 | accessdate=25 September 2015 | author=Menhem, Chantal | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925162626/http://blog.mozaico.net/glass-mosaic-artworks/ | archivedate=25 September 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, special glass tiles have been coated on the back side with a receptive white coating. This has allowed impregnation of heat-transfer dyes by a printing process reproducing high resolution pictures and designs. Custom printed glass tile and glass tile murals exhibit the toughness of glass on the wearing surface with photo-like pictures. These are especially practical in kitchens and showers, where cleanser and moisture resistance are important.

'''GlobalSantaFe Corporation''', which traded on the [[NYSE]] as GSF was an offshore [[oil]] and [[gas]] drilling [[General contractor|contractor]], which owned or operating a fleet of 59 [[Offshore drilling|marine drilling rigs]]. With its principal executive offices in [[Houston, Texas]], GlobalSantaFe was one of the largest international drilling contractors, providing offshore drilling services to the world's leading oil and gas companies.

On 23 July 2007, a merger between GlobalSantaFe and larger rival [[Transocean]] was announced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/07/23/transocean-and-globalsantafe-to-merge/ Transocean and GlobalSantaFe to Merge - Mergers, Acquisitions, Venture Capital, Hedge Funds - DealBook - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The merger was completed on 27 November 2007.  The combined company is known as Transocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deepwater.com/fw/main/default.asp?DocID=111&amp;reqid=1081502 Transocean :: Press Release&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

GlobalSantaFe was the successor to two companies, [[Global Marine]] and [[Santa Fe International Corporation]], which merged in November 2001. Both companies shared a common history of providing drilling services dating back to the [[Union Oil Company of California]] in 1946. As of June 18, 2007, the Company's fleet included 43 cantilevered [[Jackup barge|jack-up rigs]], 11 semi-submersible rigs, three [[Drillship]]s and two additional [[Semi-submersible Platform]]s it operated for third parties under a [[joint venture]] agreement.

==Products and services==

GlobalSantaFe provided offshore oil and gas contract drilling services to the oil and gas industry worldwide on a daily rate basis. It also provided oil and gas drilling management services on either a day rate or completed-project, fixed-price basis, as well as drilling engineering and drilling project management services, and it also participated in oil and gas exploration and production activities.

GlobalSantaFe provided a range of offshore drilling services to domestic and international oil and gas companies. The company's primary business was providing fully manned mobile drilling rigs to drill offshore. Known as contract drilling, this segment prices its services on a per-day basis, is capital intensive, fixed cost and highly cyclical. All of the company's rigs were designed for international operations and were deployed in most of the significant offshore rig markets in the world, including the U.S. [[Gulf of Mexico]], West Africa, the [[North Sea]], South America, the Middle East/[[Mediterranean]] and [[South East Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;GlobalSantaFe Corp.

[[Image:GTB bear-1.jpg|thumb|A [[brass]] go-to-bed bear. The hinged head allows access to the matches stored in the body; the lit match is placed in the hole at the end of the staff]]

'''Go-to-bed''' or '''getting-into-bed''' matchboxes were a variety of [[match]] storage box popular in the mid-to-late 19th century. Relatively small, about 6 cm high, they were frequently made of metal of some kind, though sometimes of wood or ivory.

Most incorporated a rough surface on which the match could be struck. All featured a small hole or [[finial]], sometimes in ivory and always part of the design, into which the lighted match could be placed, rather like a miniature [[candle]]. The idea was that, rather than risk taking a lighted candle near to the voluminous fabric of a [[four poster bed]], the lighted match on the [[Fireplace mantel|mantelpiece]] would burn for some 30 seconds — just long enough for the person to snuff out the candle and get into bed.

==Designs==
There is huge variety in the designs of these little pieces. Some were relatively simple boxes or cylindrical containers, some were barrels in wood or metal, while others were cast metal figures in a wide variety of designs. Private collections include [[castle]] towers, a [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleonic]] soldier of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], a Gothic [[knight]] holding a torch, a little boy selling newspapers, a bear chained to a ragged staff, and so on. Other designs feature [[flower seller]]s and exotic ladies with a separate 'basket' in which the matches were stored.

One specific variety of go-to-bed worthy of mention is '[[Prince Albert (disambiguation)|Prince Albert]]'s Safety Vesta Box'. This was a decorated brass tub with an embossed top. Ribbed under base for striking matches, it had a small finial to take a single match on top, and was marked 'Prince Albert's Safety Box, 150 Patent Vesta Lights'.

[[File:Manweissabgleich.jpg|thumb|Image before (left) and after (right) adjustment with gray card (middle)]]
A '''gray card''' is a [[middle gray]] reference, typically used together with a reflective [[light meter]], as a way to produce consistent image  [[exposure (photography)|exposure]] and/or [[color]] in [[film]] and [[photography]].

A gray card is a flat object of a neutral gray color that derives from a flat reflectance spectrum. A typical example is the Kodak R-27 set, which contains two 8x10" cards and one 4x5" card which have 18% reflectance across the visible spectrum, and a white reverse side which has 90% reflectance. Note that flat spectral reflectance is a stronger condition than simply appearing neutral; this flatness ensures that the card appears neutral under any illuminant (see [[Metamerism (color)|metamerism]]).

== Application ==

A major use of gray cards is to provide a standard reference object for exposure determination in photography. A gray card is an (approximate) realization of a [[Lambertian]] scatterer; its apparent brightness (and exposure determination) therefore depends only on its orientation relative to the light source. By placing a gray card in the scene to be photographed, oriented toward the direction of the incident light, and taking a reading from it with a reflected light meter, the photographer can be assured of consistent exposures across their photographs. This technique is similar to using an incident meter, as it depends on the illuminance but not the reflectivity of the subject. (Of course taking photographs with side lighting or back lighting implies that the gray card should be oriented toward the camera instead.)

In addition to providing a means for measuring exposure, a gray card provides a convenient reference for white balance, or [[color balance]], allowing the camera to compensate for the illuminant color in a scene.

Gray cards can be used for in-camera white balance or post-processing white balance. Many [[digital camera]]s have a custom white balance feature. A photo of the gray card is taken and used to set white balance for a sequence of photos. For post-processing white balance, a photo of the gray card in the scene is taken, and the image processing software uses the data from the pixels in the gray card area of the photo to set the white balance point for the whole image.

Most digital cameras do a reasonable job of controlling color but they might get it wrong.
For the casual user, a gray card is mostly unnecessary. Many serious photographers or hobbyists consider gray cards an essential part of the digital photography process.

Gray cards are made of a variety of materials including plastic, paper, and foam. Some photographers hold{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} that any neutral white or gray surface, such as a white piece of paper, a concrete or stone wall, or a white shirt are suitable substitutes for a gray card; however, since bright white papers and clothing washed in typical detergents contain [[fluorescent whitening agent]]s, they tend to not be very spectrally neutral.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www4.ncsu.edu/~hubbe/FWA.htm
  | author = North Carolina State University (Department of Wood and Paper Science)
 | work = Mini-Encyclopedia of Papermaking Wet-End Chemistry
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray cards specially made to be spectrally flat are therefore more suitable to the purpose than surfaces that happen to be available.

== Limitations ==

A gray card is useful for setting or correcting the balance of neutral colors, as well as for exposure.  Other charts, such as various [[color chart]]s, provide standard reference patterns with calibrated reflectance spectrum and color coordinates, for use in adjusting color rendering in a larger range of situations.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book

'''Hybrid vehicle drivetrains''' [[Drivetrain|transmit power]]  to the [[driving wheel]]s for [[hybrid vehicle]]s. A hybrid vehicle has multiple forms of motive power.

Hybrids come in many configurations. For example, a hybrid may receive its energy by burning petroleum, but switch between an electric motor and a combustion engine.

Electrical vehicles have a long history combining internal combustion and electrical transmission –as in a [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] powertrain–, although they have mostly been used for rail [[locomotive]]s. A diesel-electric powertrain fails the definition of hybrid because the electrical drive transmission directly replaces the mechanical transmission rather than being a supplementary source of motive power. One of the earliest forms of hybrid land vehicle is the 'trackless' [[trolleybus]] of the 1930s, which normally used traction current delivered by wire. The trolleybus was commonly fitted with an [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE) either to directly power the bus or to independently generate electricity. This enabled the vehicle to manoeuvre around obstacles and broken overhead transmission wires.

The [[powertrain]] includes all of the components used to transform stored [[potential energy]]. Powertrains may either use chemical, solar, nuclear or kinetic and make them useful for propulsion. The oldest example is the [[galley]] that used sails and oars. A common modern example is the [[electric bicycle]]. [[Hybrid electric vehicle]]s combine a [[Electric-vehicle battery|battery]] or [[supercapacitor]] supplemented by an ICE that can recharge the batteries or power the vehicle. Other hybrid powertrains use [[flywheel]]s to store energy.

Among the different types of hybrid vehicles, only the electric/ICE type was commercially available as of 2016. One variety operated [[in parallel]] to simultaneously provide power from both motors. Another operated [[in series]] with one source exclusively providing the power and the second providing electricity. Either source may provide the primary motive force, with the other augmenting the primary.

Other combinations offer efficiency gains from superior energy management and regeneration that are offset by expense, complexity and the battery limitations. Combustion-electric (CE) hybrids have battery packs with far larger capacity than a combustion-only vehicle. A combustion-electric hybrid has batteries that are light that offer higher energy density that are far more costly. ICEs require only a battery large enough to operate the electrical system and ignite the engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/03/doe-to-award-up-to-24b-for-advanced-batteries-electric-drive-components-and-electric-drive-vehicle-d.html#more |title=DOE to Award Up to $2.4B for Advanced Batteries, Electric Drive Components, and Electric Drive Vehicle Demonstration/Deployment Projects |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types by design==

==={{Visible anchor|Parallel hybrid}}=== &lt;!-- Other articles link here. --&gt;
[[File:Hybridpar.svg|thumb|Structure of a parallel hybrid electric vehicle. The grey squares represent [[differential gear]]s.]]
Parallel hybrid systems have both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor that can both individually drive the car or both coupled up jointly giving drive. This is the most common hybrid system as of 2016.

If they are joined at an axis (in parallel)'','' the speeds at this axis must be identical and the supplied [[torques]] add together. (Most electric bicycles are of this type.) When only one of the two sources is in use, the other must either also rotate (idle), be connected by a one-way [[clutch]] or [[freewheel]].

With cars the two sources may be applied to the same shaft (for example with the electric motor connected between the engine and transmission), turning at equal speeds and the torques adding up with the electric motor adding or subtracting torque to the system as necessary. (The [[Honda Insight]] uses this system.)

Parallel hybrids can be further categorized by the balance between the different motors are at providing motive power: the ICE may be dominant (engaging the electric motor only in specific circumstances) or vice versa; while in others can run on the electric system alone but because current parallel hybrids are unable to provide electric-only or internal combustion-only modes they are often categorized as '''mild hybrids''' (see below).

Parallel hybrids rely more on [[regenerative braking]] and the ICE can also act as a generator for supplemental recharging. This makes them more efficient in urban 'stop-and-go' conditions. They use a smaller battery pack than other hybrids. [[Honda]]'s Insight, [[Honda Civic Hybrid|Civic]], and [[Honda Accord Hybrid|Accord]] hybrids are examples of production parallel hybrids.&lt;ref name="UCSHbrid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hybridcenter.org/hybrid-center-how-hybrid-cars-work-under-the-hood-2.html |title=Hybrids Under the Hood (Part 2): Drivetrains |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=Hybrid Center ([[Union of Concerned Scientists]]) |dead-url=yes |access-date= |accessdate=2010-03-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111032823/http://www.hybridcenter.org/hybrid-center-how-hybrid-cars-work-under-the-hood-2.html |archivedate=2010-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; General Motors [[Parallel Hybrid Truck]] (PHT) and [[BAS Hybrid]]s such as the Saturn VUE and Aura Greenline and Chevrolet Malibu hybrids also employ a parallel hybrid architecture.

====Through The Road (TTR) Hybrid====
An alternative parallel hybrid is the 'through the road' type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What do you mean when you say Through-The-Road-Hybrid (TTRH)?  |publisher=Protean Electric |url=http://www.proteanelectric.com/en/faqs/what-do-you-mean-when-you-say-through-the-road-hybrid-ttrh/ |accessdate= July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Through-The-Road (TTR) Hybrid - Through-The-Roof Potential - 598 |publisher=Argonne National Laboratory |url=http://www.transportation.anl.gov/pdfs/HV/598.PDF |accessdate= July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this system a conventional drivetrain powers one axle, with an electric motor or motors driving another. This arrangement was used by the earliest 'off track' trolleybuses. It in effect provides a complete backup power train. In modern motors batteries can be recharged through regenerative braking or by loading the electrically driven wheels during cruise. This allows a simpler approach to power-management. This layout also has the advantage of providing four-wheel-drive in some conditions. (An example of this principle is a bicycle fitted with a front hub motor, which assists the cyclist's pedal power at the rear wheel.) Vehicles of this type include the [[Audi hybrid vehicles#Audi 100 Duo II|Audi 100 Duo II]], [[Subaru VIZIV]] and [[Peugeot 307#Hybrid HDi|Peugeot 307 Hybrid HDi]] concept cars, the [[Groupe PSA|PSA Group]] vehicles [[Peugeot 3008#Hybrid version|Peugeot 3008]], [[Peugeot 508]], [[Peugeot 508#508 RXH|508 RXH]], [[Citroen DS5]] all using the [[PSA HYbrid4|HYbrid4]] system, the [[Volvo V60#V60 Plug-in Hybrid|Volvo V60 plug-in hybrid]], the [[BMW 2 Series Active Tourer]], [[BMW i8]], and the [[Honda NSX (second generation)|second generation Honda NSX]].

==={{Visible anchor|Series hybrid}}=== &lt;!-- Other articles link here. --&gt;
[[File:Hybridpeak.svg|thumb|Structure of a series-hybrid vehicle. The grey square represents a differential gear. An alternative arrangement (not shown) is to have electric motors at two or four wheels.]]
Series hybrids are also referred to as [[Range extender (vehicle)|extended-range electric vehicles]] (EREV)&lt;ref Name=R1&gt;{{cite web|title=The Voltec System - Energy Storage and Electric Propulsion|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262004450_The_Voltec_System_Energy_Storage_and_Electric_Propulsion|last1=Matthe|first1=Roland|last2=Eberle|first2=Ulrich|date=2014-01-01|accessdate=2014-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; or range-extended electric vehicles (REEV). (Series hybrids with particular characteristics are classified as range-extended battery-electric vehicle (BEVx) by the [[California Air Resources Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2014 BMW i3 Electric Car: Why California Set Range Requirements, Engine Limits|url = http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1087888_2014-bmw-i3-electric-car-why-california-set-range-requirements-engine-limits|website = Green Car Reports|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Electric transmission has been available as an alternative to conventional mechanical transmissions since 1903. Typically mechanical transmissions impose many penalties, including weight, bulk, noise, cost, complexity and a drain on engine power with every gear-change, whether accomplished manually or automatically. Unlike ICEs, electric motors do not require a transmission.

In effect the entire mechanical transmission between the ICE and the wheels is removed and replaced by an electric generator, some cable and controls, and electric [[traction motor]]s, with the benefit that the ICE is no longer directly connected to the demand.

This is a series-hybrid arrangement and is common in [[diesel-electric]] [[locomotive]]s and ships (the Russian river ship [[Vandal (tanker)|Vandal]], launched in 1903, was the world's first [[Diesel engine|diesel-powered]] and [[diesel-electric]] powered vessel) and [[Ferdinand Porsche]] successfully used this arrangement in the early 20th century in racing cars, including the [[Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid]]. Porsche named the system System Mixte, which had a [[wheel hub motor]] arrangement, with a motor in each of the two front wheels, setting speed records.

The arguments of greater flexibility, higher efficiency and less emissions at the point of use are achieved in a series-hybrid system for road vehicles when an intermediate electric battery, acting as an energy buffer, sits between the electric generator and the electric traction motors.

The ICE turns a generator and is not mechanically connected to the driving wheels. This isolates the engine from demand, allowing it to consistently operate at its most efficient speed. Since the primary motive power is generated by the battery, a smaller generator/engine can be fitted as compared to a conventional direct drive engine. Electric traction motors can receive electricity from the battery, or directly from the engine/generator or both. Traction motors frequently are powered only by the electric battery, which can be charged from external sources such as the electricity grid.

This allows a vehicle with an engine/generator that only operates when needed, such as when the battery is depleted, or to charge the batteries.

===Electric traction motors===
Electric motors are more efficient than ICEs, with high [[power-to-weight ratio]]s providing torque over a wide speed range. ICEs are most efficient when turning at a constant speed.

ICEs can run optimally when turning a generator. Series-hybrid systems offer smoother acceleration by avoiding gear changes. Series-hybrids incorporate:

* Electric traction only – using only electric motors to turn the wheels.
* ICE – turns only a generator.
* Generator – turned by the ICE to generate electricity and start the engine.
* Battery – energy buffer. 
* Regenerative braking – The drive motor becomes a generator and recovers energy by converting kinetic to electrical energy, also slowing the vehicle and preventing thermal losses.

In addition:

* May be plugged into the grid to recharge the battery.
* [[Supercapacitor]]s assist the battery and recover most energy from braking.

====In detail====
The electric motor may be entirely fed by electricity from the battery or via the generator turned by the ICE, or both. Such a vehicle conceptually resembles a [[diesel-electric]] [[locomotive]] with the addition of a battery that may power the vehicle without running the ICE and acting as an energy buffer that is used to accelerate and achieve greater speed; the generator may simultaneously charge the battery and power the electric motor that moves the vehicle.

When the vehicle is stopped the ICE is switched off without idling, while the battery provides whatever power is needed at rest. Vehicles at traffic lights, or in slow moving stop-start traffic need not burn fuel when stationary or moving slowly, reducing emissions.

Series-hybrids can be fitted with a [[supercapacitor]] or a [[flywheel]] to store [[regenerative braking]] energy, which can improve efficiency by recovering energy otherwise lost as heat through the braking system. Because a series-hybrid has no mechanical link between the ICE and the wheels, the engine can run at a constant and efficient rate regardless of vehicle speed, achieving higher efficiency (37%, rather than the ICE average of 20%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://courses.washington.edu/me341/oct22v2.htm |title=Improving IC Engine Efficiency |publisher=University of Washington: Energy &amp; Environment – Autumn 2001 |accessdate=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and at low or mixed speeds this could result in ~50% increase in overall efficiency (19% vs 29%).

[[Lotus Cars|Lotus]] offered an engine/generator set design that runs at two speeds, giving 15&amp;nbsp;kW of electrical power at 1,500 rpm and 35&amp;nbsp;kW at 3,500 rpm via the integrated electrical generator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/09/lotus-range-extender.html#more |title=Lotus to Introduce Range Extender Engine |publisher=Green Car Congress |date=September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; used in the Nissan concept [[Infiniti Emerg-e]].

This operating profile allows greater scope for alternative engine designs, such as a [[Microturbines|microturbine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=William|last=Neuman|date=October 11, 2007|work=[[New York Times]]|url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/11/the-turbine-on-the-bus-goes-purr-purr-purr/ |title=The turbine on the bus goes purr purr purr}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Atkinson cycle#Rotary Atkinson-cycle engine|rotary Atkinson cycle engine]] or [[Linear Combustion Engine|linear combustion engine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lceproject.org/en/ Linear Combustion Engine Project ]. Retrieved April 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICE is matched to the electric engine by comparing the output rates at [[cruising speed]]. Generally, output rates for combustion engines are provided for instantaneous (peak) output rates,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diygokarts.com/vb/showthread.php?t=9700 Combustion engines being given instantaneous power ratings]&lt;/ref&gt; but in practice these can't be used.)

The use of an [[wheel hub motor|electric motor driving a wheel directly]] eliminates the conventional mechanical transmission elements: gearbox, transmission shafts and differential, and can sometimes eliminate [[Constant-velocity joint|flexible couplings]].

In 1997, Toyota released the first series-hybrid bus sold in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/1997/08/22/news/toyota-debuts-power-hybrid-bus/#.UXAtnMr76dw |title=Toyota debuts power-hybrid bus |work=The Japan Times |date=August 22, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DesignLine Corporation|Designline International]] of Ashburton, New Zealand produces city buses with a [[Microturbine#Microturbines|microturbine]] powered series-hybrid system. [[Wrightbus]] produces series hybrid buses including the [[Wright Gemini 2|Gemini 2]] and [[New Routemaster]]. [[Supercapacitors]] combined with a [[lithium ion]] battery bank have been used by [[AFS Trinity]] in a converted Saturn Vue SUV vehicle. Using [[supercapacitors]] they claim up to 150 mpg in a series-hybrid arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afstrinity.com/press/releases/press-release-9-24-08.html |title=AFS Trinity urgees Congress and candidates to support proposed auto stimulus package |publisher=AFS Trinity |date=September 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well known automotive series hybrid models include the variant of the [[BMW i3]] that is equipped with a range extender. Another example of a series hybrid automobile is the [[Fisker Karma]]. The [[Chevrolet Volt]] is almost a series hybrid, but also includes a mechanical link from the engine to the wheels above 70&amp;nbsp;mph.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2010/10/gm-admits-chevy-volts-gasoline-engine-can-power-the-wheels-so-is-it-still-special.html GM Admits Chevy Volt’s Gasoline Engine Can Power the Wheels; So is it Still Special?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/a6179/chevy-volt-hybrid-drive-system/ The Volt's Hybrid Drive System]&lt;/ref&gt;

Series-hybrids have been taken up by the aircraft industry. The DA36 E-Star, an aircraft designed by [[Siemens]], [[Diamond Aircraft Industries|Diamond Aircraft]] and [[EADS]], employs a [[series hybrid]] powertrain with the propeller turned by a Siemens 70&amp;nbsp;kW (94&amp;nbsp;hp) electric motor. A power sapping propeller speed reduction unit is eliminated. The aim is to reduce fuel consumption and emissions by up to 25 percent. An onboard 40&amp;nbsp;hp (30&amp;nbsp;kW) [[Austro Engine]] Wankel rotary engine and generator provides the electricity.

The Wankel was chosen because of its small size, low weight and great power to weight ratio. (Wankel engines also run efficiently at a constant speed of approximately 2,000 RPM which is suited to generator operation. Keeping to a constant/narrow band offsets many of the perceived disadvantages of the Wankel engine in automotive applications.&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/9550675/Mazda-stays-loyal-to-rotary-engines.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Mazda stays loyal to rotary engines | date=September 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The electric propeller motor uses electricity stored in batteries, with the engines not operating, to take off and climb reducing sound emissions. The powertrain reduces the weight of the plane by 100 kilos relative to its predecessor. The DA36 E-Star first flew in June 2013, making this the first ever flight of a series hybrid powertrain. Diamond Aircraft state that the technology is scalable to a 100-seat aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url= http://green.autoblog.com/2011/07/03/siemens-diamond-aircraft-eads-unveil-worlds-first-serial-hybr/ |title=Siemens, Diamond Aircraft, EADS unveil world's first serial hybrid aircraft |publisher=Autoblog |date=2011-07-03 |accessdate=2011-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2013/06/eads-21030618.html| title=EADS and Siemens enter long-term research partnership for electric aviation propulsion; MoU with Diamond Aircraft | date= 2013-06-18 | accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In-wheel motors====
If the motors are attached to the vehicle body, [[Constant-velocity joint|flexible couplings]] are required but not if the traction motors are [[wheel motor|integrated into the wheels]]. One disadvantage is that the [[unsprung mass]] increases and suspension responsiveness decreases, which impacts ride and potentially safety. However the impact should be minimal as electric motors in wheel hubs such as [[Hi-Pa Drive]], may be very small and light having exceptionally high [[power-to-weight ratio]]s and braking mechanisms can be lighter as the wheel motors brake the vehicle.

Advantages of individual wheel motors include simplified [[traction control system|traction control]], [[all wheel drive]] if required and a lower floor (useful for buses and other specialised vehicles (some [[Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck|8x8 all-wheel drive military vehicles]] use individual wheel motors). [[Diesel-electric]] [[locomotive]]s [https://web.archive.org/web/20150901062917/http://www.railway-technical.com/diesel.shtml have used this concept] (individual motors driving axles of each pair of wheels) for 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;Churella, 28-30&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Other measures include lightweight aluminium wheels to reduce the [[unsprung mass]] of the wheel assembly; vehicle designs may be optimized to lower the centre of gravity by locating heavier elements (including battery) at floor level; In a typical road vehicle the power-transmission setup may be smaller and lighter than the equivalent conventional mechanical power-transmission setup, liberating space; the combustion generator set only requires cables to the driving electric motors, increasing flexibility in major component layout spread across a vehicle giving superior weight distribution and maximizing vehicle cabin space and opening up the possibility of superior vehicle designs exploiting this flexibility.

===Power-split or series-parallel hybrid===
[[File:Hybridcombined.svg|thumb|Structure of a combined hybrid electric vehicle]]

'''Power-split hybrid''' or '''series-parallel hybrid''' are parallel hybrids that incorporate power-split devices, allowing for power paths from the ICE to the wheels that can be either mechanical or electrical. The main principle is to decouple the power supplied by the primary source from the power demanded by the driver.

ICE torque output is minimal at lower RPMs and conventional vehicles increase engine size to meet market requirements for acceptable initial acceleration. The larger engine has more power than needed for cruising. Electric motors produce full torque at standstill and are well-suited to complement ICE torque deficiency at low RPMs. In a power-split hybrid, a smaller, less flexible, and more efficient engine can be used. The conventional [[Otto cycle]] (higher power density, more low-RPM torque, lower fuel efficiency) is often modified to an [[Atkinson cycle]] or [[Miller cycle]] (lower power density, less low-rpm torque, higher fuel efficiency; sometimes called an Atkinson-Miller cycle). The smaller engine, using a more efficient cycle and often operating in the favorable region of the [[brake specific fuel consumption]] map, significantly contributes to the higher overall efficiency of the vehicle.

Interesting variations of the simple design (pictured at right) found, for example, in the well-known [[Toyota Prius]] are the:

* fixed gear second [[Epicyclic gearing|planetary gearset]] as used in the [[Lexus RX|Lexus RX400h]] and [[Toyota Highlander|Toyota Highlander Hybrid]]. This allows for a motor with less torque but higher power (and higher maximum rotary speed), i.e. higher power density
* [[Ravigneaux planetary gearset|Ravigneaux]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/physmod/sdl/ref/ravigneauxgear.html |title=Ravigneaux planetary gear set of carrier, sun, planet, and ring wheels with adjustable gear ratios and friction losses - Simulink |publisher=Mathworks.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;-type planetary gear (planetary gear with 4 shafts instead of 3) and two clutches as used in the [[Lexus GS|Lexus GS450h]]. By switching the clutches, the gear ratio from MG2 (the traction motor) to the wheel shaft is switched, either for higher torque or higher speed (up to 250&amp;nbsp;km/h / 155&amp;nbsp;mph) while sustaining better transmission efficiency. This is effectively accomplished in the Generation 3 Prius HSDs (Prius v, Prius Plug-in and Prius c), although the Generation 3 HSD has this second planetary gear set fixed at 2.5:1, rather than switching between 1:1 and 2.5:1 as the "carrier" is held fixed.
[[File:2016 Toyota Prius (ZVW50R) Hybrid liftback (2016-04-02) 01.jpg|thumb|Power-splitter series-hybrid [[Toyota Prius]].]]
* Two additional planetary gear sets in combination with four clutches to create a [[Two-Mode Hybrid]] configuration able to operate in all-electric, blended electric and ICE, or ICE alone with four fixed gears. Examples of [[Two-Mode Hybrid]]s include the [[General Motors]] [[Two-Mode Hybrid]] full-size trucks and SUVs, the [[BMW X6|BMW X6 ActiveHybrid]]&lt;ref name="an"&gt;Krust, Matthias (July 14, 2009). [http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090714/COPY02/307149993&amp;AssignSessionID=373348067472168 "BMW, Daimler, GM hybrid alliance nears end"]. [[Automotive News]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mercedes-Benz M Class|Mercedes ML 450 hybrid]].&lt;ref name="an"/&gt;

The Toyota Hybrid System THS / [[Hybrid Synergy Drive]] has a single power-split device (incorporated as a single three-shaft planetary gearset) and can be classified as an Input-Split, since the power of the engine is split at the input to the transmission. This in turn makes this setup very simple in mechanical terms, but has drawbacks of its own. For example, in Generation 1 and Generation 2 HSDs maximum speed is mainly limited by the speed of the smaller electric motor (often functioning as a generator). The Generation 3 HSD separates the ICE-MG1 path from the MG2 path, each with its own, tailored gear ratio (1.1:1 and 2.5:1, respectively, for late Priuses, including the Prius c). The Generation 4 HSD eliminates the second planetary gear set, and places the electric motors on parallel axes, with a combining gear in between these axes, and transfers the combined result to the final drive differential. This is quite similar to Toyota-affiliated [[Aisin Seiki]]'s hybrid system, and saves significant space.

[[General Motors]], [[BMW]], and [[DaimlerChrysler]] collaborated on a system named "Two-Mode Hybrid" as part of the [[Global Hybrid Cooperation]].

The [[Two-Mode Hybrid]] name highlights the drive-train's ability to operate in all-electric (Mode 1, or ''Input-Split'') as well as hybrid (Mode 2, or ''Compound-Split'') modes. The design allows for operation in more than two modes. Two power-split modes are available, along with several fixed gear (essentially parallel hybrid) regimes. Such a design can be referred to as a multi-regime design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wishart|first1= J.|last2= Zhou|first2= Y.|last3= Dong|first3= Z. |year=2008|title=Review of multi-regime hybrid vehicle powertrain architecture|work= International Journal of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles|volume=1|issue=3|doi=10.1504/IJEHV.2008.019900|pages= 248–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Two-Mode Hybrid powertrain design can be classified as a compound-split design, since the addition of four clutches within the transmission allows for multiple configurations of engine power-splitting. In addition to the clutches, this transmission has a second planetary gearset. The objective of the design is to vary the percentage of mechanically vs. electrically transmitted power to cope both with low-speed and high-speed operating conditions. This enables smaller motors to do the job of larger motors when compared to single-mode systems, because the derived electrical peak power is proportional to the width of the continuous variation range. The four fixed gears enable the Two-Mode Hybrid to function like a conventional parallel hybrid under high continuous power regions such as sustained high speed cruising or trailer towing. Full electric boost is available in fixed gear modes.&lt;ref name="GM Two-Mode"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gm.com/experience/fuel_economy/hybrids.jsp|title=Powerfully Efficient: GM Two-Mode Hybrid|publisher=General Motors|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225071649/http://www.gm.com/experience/fuel_economy/hybrids.jsp|archivedate=February 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Micro hybrids===
Micro hybrid is a general term given to vehicles that use some type of [[start-stop system]] to automatically shut off the engine when [[Idle speed|idling]]. Strictly speaking, micro hybrids are not real hybrid vehicles, because they do not rely on two different sources of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kfz-tech.de/Engl/HybridBegriffe.htm|title=Hybrid-electro Drives (terms)|publisher=KFZ-tech.de|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mild hybrids===
{{main article|Mild hybrid}}
[[File:2006 GMC Sierra Hybrid engine.jpg|right|thumb|Engine compartment of a 2006 [[GMC Sierra]] Hybrid.]]
Mild hybrids are essentially conventional vehicles with some hybrid hardware, but with limited hybrid features. Typically, they are a parallel hybrid with start-stop only or possibly with modest levels of engine assist or regenerative braking. Mild hybrids generally cannot provide all-electric propulsion.

Mild hybrids like the General Motors 2004-07 Parallel Hybrid Truck (PHT) and the Honda Eco-Assist hybrids are equipped with a [[three-phase]] electric motor mounted within the bell-housing between the engine and transmission, allowing the engine to be turned off whenever the truck is coasting, braking, or stopped, yet restart quickly to provide power. Accessories can continue to run on electrical power while the engine is off, and as in other hybrid designs, regenerative braking recaptures energy. The large electric motor spins up the engine to operating&amp;nbsp;speeds before injecting fuel.

The 2004–07 [[Chevrolet Silverado]] PHT was a full-size [[pickup truck]]. Chevrolet was able to get a 10% efficiency improvement by shutting down and restarting the engine on demand and using regenerative braking. The electrical energy was used only to drive accessories such as power steering. The GM PHT used a [[42-volt electrical system|42 volt system]] via three 12&amp;nbsp;volt vented [[Lead–acid battery|lead acid batteries]] connected in series (36V total) to supply the power needed for the startup motor, as well as to power the electronic accessories.

[[General Motors]] then introduced their [[BAS Hybrid]] system, another [[mild hybrid]] implementation officially released on the 2007 [[Saturn Vue|Saturn Vue Green Line]]. Its "start-stop" functionality operates similarly to the Silverado, although via a belted connection to the motor/generator unit. However the GM [[BAS Hybrid|BAS Hybrid System]] can also provide modest assist under acceleration and during steady driving, and captures energy during regenerative (blended) braking. BAS Hybrid offered as much as a 27% improvement in combined fuel efficiency in EPA testing of the 2009 Saturn VUE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/sbs.htm |title=Compare Cars Side-by-Side |publisher=Fueleconomy.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system can also be found on the 2008-09 [[Saturn Aura]] and the 2008-2010 [[Chevrolet Malibu]] hybrids.

Another way to offer start/stop is by employing a static start engine. Such an engine requires no starter motor, but employs sensors to determine the exact position of each piston, then precisely timing the injection and ignition of fuel to ''turn over'' the engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kassakian |first=J.G |title=Automotive electrical systems circa 2005 |journal=Spectrum, IEEE |year=1996 |volume=33 |issue=8 |pages=22–27 |doi=10.1109/6.511737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mild hybrids are sometimes called ''Power assist hybrids'' as they use the ICE for primary power, with a torque-boosting electric motor connected to a (largely) conventional power train. The electric motor is mounted between the engine and transmission. It is essentially a large starter motor that operates when the engine needs to be turned over and when the driver "steps on the gas" and requires extra power. The electric motor may also restart the combustion engine and shutting down the main engine at idle, while the enhanced battery system is used to power accessories.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} GM announced [[Buick LaCrosse]] and [[Buick Regal]] mild hybrids dubbed Eassist.

[[Honda]]'s hybrids, including the [[Honda Insight|Insight]], use this design, leveraging their expertise in small, efficient gasoline engines; their system is dubbed [[Integrated Motor Assist]] (IMA). IMA hybrids cannot provide propulsion on electric power alone. However, since the amount of electrical power needed is much smaller, system size is reduced.

Another variation is the [[Saturn Vue#Green Line|Saturn Vue Green Line]] BAS Hybrid system that uses a smaller electric motor (mounted to the side of the engine) and battery pack than the Honda IMA, but functions similarly.

Another variation on this type is [[Mazda]]'s e-4WD system, offered on the [[Mazda Demio]] sold in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} This [[front-wheel drive]] vehicle has an electric motor that can drive the rear wheels when extra [[traction (engineering)|traction]] is needed. The system is disengaged in all other driving conditions, so it does not directly enhance performance or economy but allows the use of a smaller and more economical engine relative to total performance.

Ford has dubbed Honda's hybrids "mild" in their advertising for the Escape Hybrid, arguing that the Escape's full hybrid design is more efficient.

===Full hybrids===
[[File:2006 Mercury Mariner Hybrid engine.jpg|right|thumb|Engine compartment of a 2006 [[Mercury Mariner Hybrid]].]]
A '''full hybrid''', sometimes also called a '''strong hybrid''', is a vehicle that can run on just the engine, the batteries, or a combination. The [[Toyota Prius]], [[Toyota Camry Hybrid]], [[Ford Escape Hybrid]]/[[Mercury Mariner Hybrid]], [[Ford Fusion Hybrid]]/[[Lincoln MKZ Hybrid]]/[[Mercury Milan Hybrid]], [[Ford C-Max Hybrid]], [[Kia Optima Hybrid]], as well as the General Motors [[2-mode hybrid]] trucks and SUVs, are examples of this type of hybridization as they can operate on battery power alone. A large, high-capacity battery provides battery-only operation. These vehicles have a split power path that allows more flexibility in the drivetrain by inter-converting mechanical and electrical power. To balance the forces from each portion, the vehicles use a [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]]-style linkage between the engine and motor connected to the head end of the transmission.

The Toyota brand name for this technology is [[Hybrid Synergy Drive]], which is used in the Prius, the [[Toyota Highlander Hybrid|Highlander Hybrid]] [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]] and the [[Camry Hybrid]]. A computer oversees system operation, determining how to mix the power sources. The Prius operations can be divided into six distinct regimes.

:Electric vehicle mode—The ICE is off and the battery powers the motor (or charges during regenerative braking). Used for idling when the battery [[state of charge]] (SOC) is high.

:Cruise mode—The vehicle is cruising (i.e. not accelerating), and the ICE can meet the demand. The power from the engine is split between the mechanical path and the generator. The battery also powers the motor, whose power is summed mechanically with the engine. If the battery state-of-charge is low, part of the power from the generator charges the battery.

:Overdrive mode—A portion of the rotational energy produces electricity, because the ICE's full power is not needed to maintain speed. This electrical energy is used to drive the sun gear in the direction opposite its usual rotation. The end result has the ring gear rotating faster than the engine, albeit at lower torque.

:Battery charge mode—Also used for idling, except that in this case the battery state-of-charge is low and requires charging, which is provided by the engine and generator.

:Power boost mode—Employed in situations where the engine cannot maintain the desired speed. The battery powers the motor to complement the engine power.

:Negative split mode—The vehicle is cruising and the battery state-of-charge is high. The battery provides power to both the motor (to provide mechanical power) and to the generator. The generator converts this to mechanical energy that it directs towards the engine shaft, slowing it down (although not altering its torque output). The purpose of this engine "lugging" is to increase the fuel economy of the vehicle.

===Plug-in hybrid===
[[File:Volt charging.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Chevrolet Volt]] charging]]
{{Main article|Plug-in hybrid}} {{See also|Vehicle-to-grid|Plug-in electric vehicle}}
A [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]] (PHEV) has two defining characteristics. It:

* Can be plugged into an electrical outlet to be charged.
* Can travel powered only by the battery.

They are full hybrids, able to run on battery power. They offer greater battery capacity and the ability to recharge from the [[electric power transmission|grid]]. They can be either parallel or series designs. They are also called ''gas-optional'', or ''griddable'' hybrids. Their main benefit is that they can be gasoline-independent for significant distances, with the extended range of an ICE for longer trips. [[Electric Power Research Institute]] research found a lower [[total cost of ownership]] for PHEVs due to reduced service costs and gradually improving battery technology. The "[[well-to-wheel]]" efficiency and emissions of PHEVs compared to gasoline hybrids depends on the grid energy sources (the US grid is 30% [[coal]]; California's grid is primarily [[natural gas]], [[hydroelectric power]], and [[wind power]]). 
[[File:Byd duel mode engine.jpg|thumb|left|Engine compartment of a [[BYD F3DM]] plug-in hybrid.]]
[[Prototype]]s of PHEVs, with larger battery packs that can be recharged from the power grid, were built in the U.S., notably at [[Andrew A. Frank|Andy Frank]]'s Hybrid Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Team Fate | publisher=UC-Davis Hybrid Electric Vehicles Group | url=http://www.team-fate.net/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[University of California, Davis]].

==Types by power source==

===Electric-internal combustion engine hybrid===
There are many ways to create an electric-Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) hybrid. The variety of electric-ICE designs can be differentiated by how the electric and combustion portions of the powertrain connect, at what times each portion is in operation, and what percent of the power is provided by each hybrid component. Two major categories are '''series hybrids''' and '''parallel hybrids''', though '''parallel designs''' are most common today.

Most hybrids, no matter the specific type, use [[regenerative braking]] to recover energy when slowing down the vehicle. This simply involves driving a motor so it acts as a generator.

Many designs also shut off the internal combustion engine when it is not needed in order to save energy. That concept is not unique to hybrids; [[Subaru]] pioneered this feature in the early 1980s, and the [[Volkswagen Lupo|Volkswagen Lupo 3L]] is one example of a conventional vehicle that shuts off its engine when at a stop. Some provision must be made, however, for accessories such as [[air conditioning]] which are normally driven by the engine. Furthermore, the lubrication systems of internal combustion engines are inherently least effective immediately after the engine starts; since it is upon startup that the majority of engine wear occurs, the frequent starting and stopping of such systems reduce the lifespan of the engine considerably.{{Dubious|reason=frequent starting engines are already warm and lubricated|date=May 2014}} Also, start and stop cycles may reduce the engine's ability to operate at its optimum temperature, thus reducing the engine's efficiency.

[[File:Hybridfuelcell.svg|thumb|Structure of a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle]]

===Electric-fuel cell hybrid===
[[Fuel cell]] vehicles are often fitted with a battery or supercapacitor to deliver peak acceleration power and to reduce the size and power constraints on the fuel cell (and thus its cost); this is effectively also a series hybrid configuration.

===Internal combustion engine-hydraulic hybrid===
[[File:Chrysler_Pacifica_Hybrid_WAS_2017_1684.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chrysler]] offers the [[Chrysler Pacifica (RU)|Pacifica]] minivan as a plug-in hybrid]]
A [[hydraulic hybrid]] vehicle uses hydraulic and mechanical components instead of electrical. A [[variable displacement pump]] replaces the electric motor/generator. A [[hydraulic accumulator]] stores energy. The vessel typically carries a flexible bladder of pre-charged pressurized nitrogen gas. Pumped hydraulic fluid is compressed against the bladder storing the energy in the compressed nitrogen gas. Some versions have a piston in a cylinder rather than a pressurized bladder. The hydraulic accumulator is potentially cheaper and more durable than batteries. Hydraulic hybrid technology was originally implemented in Germany in the 1930s. Volvo Flygmotor used petro-hydraulic hybrids experimentally in buses from the early 1980s.

The initial concept involved a giant [[flywheel]] (see [[Gyrobus]]) for storage connected to a hydrostatic transmission. The system is under development by [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] and several other companies, primarily in heavy vehicles like buses, trucks and military vehicles. An example is the Ford F-350 Mighty Tonka concept truck shown in 2002. It features an Eaton system that can accelerate the truck to highway speeds.

The system components were expensive, which precluded installation in smaller trucks and cars. A drawback was that the power motors were not efficient enough at part load. Focus switched to smaller vehicles. A British company made a breakthrough by introducing an electronically controlled hydraulic motor/pump that is efficient at all ranges and loads, making small applications of petro-hydraulic hybrids feasible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artemisip.com/our-technology |title=Our Technology |publisher=Artemis Intelligent Power |accessdate=April 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729061859/http://artemisip.com/our-technology |archivedate=July 29, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company converted a BMW car to prove viability. The BMW 530i gave double the MPG in city driving compared to the standard car. The test used the standard 3,000 cc engine. Petro-hydraulic hybrids allows downsizing an engine to average power usage, not peak power usage. Peak power is provided by the energy stored in the accumulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artemisip.com/applications/on-road |title=Applications – On-road |publisher=Artemis Intelligent Power |accessdate=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kinetic braking energy recovery rate is higher and therefore the system is more efficient than 2013-era battery charged hybrids, demonstrating a 60% to 70% increase in economy in EPA testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oms/technology/420f05006.pdf |title=EPA Announces Partnership to Demonstrate World's First Full Hydraulic Hybrid Urban Delivery Vehicle |publisher=EPA |date=February 2005 |accessdate=April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In EPA tests a hydraulic hybrid Ford Expedition returned {{convert|32|mpgus|L/100 km|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} in urban driving and {{convert|22|mpgus|L/100 km|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} on the highway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vanzieleghem |first=Bruno |url=http://www.autobloggreen.com/2006/06/15/capturing-the-power-of-hydraulics |title=Capturing the power of hydraulics |publisher=Autoblog Green |date=June 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One research company's goal was to create a fresh design to improve the packaging of gasoline-hydraulic hybrid components. All bulky hydraulic components were integrated into the chassis. One design claimed to reach 130mpg in tests by using a large hydraulic accumulator that is also the structural chassis. The hydraulic driving motors are incorporated within the wheel hubs and reversing to recover braking energy. The aim is 170 mpg in average driving conditions. Energy created by shock absorbers and kinetic braking energy that normally would be wasted assists in charging the accumulator. An ICE sized for average power use charges the accumulator. The accumulator is sized to run the car for 15 minutes when fully charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Proefrock |first=Philip |url=http://inhabitat.com/hybrid-hydraulic-drive-vehicle-promises-170-mpg/ |title=Hybrid Hydraulic Drive Vehicle Promises 170 MPG |publisher=Inhabitat |date=March 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Turpen |first=Aaron |url=http://www.torquenews.com/1080/ingocar-valentin-tech-shatters-way-we-think-about-cars |title=INGOCAR from Valentin Tech shatters the way we think about cars |publisher=Torque News |date=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valentintechnologies.com/default.asp |title=170 MPG Ingocar |publisher=Valentin Technologies, Inc |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421115904/http://www.valentintechnologies.com/default.asp |archivedate=April 21, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company claimed a standard pickup vehicle powered by a 2.3 litre 4 cylinder engine achieved 14 MPG (16.8 l/100&amp;nbsp;km) in city driving. Using the petro-hydraulic setup fuel economy reached "the mid 20s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wardsauto.com/vehicles-amp-technology/new-hydraulic-hybrid-system-claims-big-mpg-boost | title=New Hydraulic Hybrid System Claims Big MPG Boost | author=David C.

===Internal combustion engine-pneumatic===
Compressed air can power a hybrid car with a gasoline compressor to provide the power. [[Motor Development International]] in France was developing such air-powered cars. A team led by Tsu-Chin Tsao, a [[UCLA]] mechanical and aerospace engineering professor, collaborated with engineers from Ford to get pneumatic hybrid technology up and running. The system is similar to that of a hybrid-electric vehicle in that braking energy is harnessed and stored to assist the engine as needed during acceleration.

===Human power-environmental power===
Many land and water vehicles use human power combined with a further power source. Common are parallel hybrids, e.g. a sailboat with oars, [[motorized bicycle]]s or a [[human-electric hybrid vehicle]] such as the [[Twike]]. Some series hybrids exist. Such vehicles can be [[tribrid vehicle]]s, combining three power sources e.g. on-board solar cells, grid-charged batteries and pedals.

==Hybrid vehicle operation modes==
Hybrid vehicles can be used in different modes. The figure shows some typical modes for a parallel hybrid configuration.

==Aftermarket options==
[[Conmarket]]/[[aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] powertrain can be added to a vehicle.

The conmarket solution is used when the user delivers [[Electric vehicle conversion|glider]] ([[rolling chassis]]) and the hybrid (two engines) or all-electric (only an electric motor) powertrain kit to the [[automaker]] and receives the vehicle with the tech installed. An (electric or hybrid) powertrain can be added to a glider&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy05osti/37567.pdf |title=Energy Storage Fuel Cell Vehicle Analysis: Preprint |publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory |date=April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; by an aftermarket installer.

{{refimprove|date=July 2007}}

An '''instrument amplifier''' is an [[electronic amplifier|electronic device]] that converts the often barely audible or purely electronic signal of a [[musical instrument]] into a larger electronic signal to feed to a loudspeaker. An instrument amplifier is used with musical instruments such as an [[electric guitar]], an [[bass guitar|electric bass]], [[Hammond organ|electric organ]], [[synthesizer]]s and [[drum machine]] to convert the signal from the [[pickup (music technology)|pickup]] (with guitars and other string instruments and some keyboards) or other sound source (e.g, a synthesizer's signal) into an electronic signal that has enough power, due to being routed through a [[power amplifier]], capable of driving one or more [[loudspeaker]] that can be heard by the performers and audience. 

Combination ("combo") amplifiers include a [[preamplifier]], a power amplifier, tone controls, and one or more speakers in a [[speaker enclosure|cabinet]], a housing or box usually made of hardwood, plywood or particleboard (or, less commonly, moulded plastic). Instrument amplifiers for some instruments are also available without an internal speaker; these amplifiers, called ''heads'', must plug into one or more external speaker cabinets. Instrument amplifiers also have features that let the performer modify the signal's [[Timbre|tone]], such as changing the equalization (adjusting bass and treble tone) or adding [[effects unit|electronic effects]] such as intentional [[distortion (music)|distortion/overdrive]], [[reverb]] or [[chorus effect]].
[[Image:Pink-Guitar-Amp.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Fender "combo" amplifier. The combination amplifier is a preamplifier, power amplifier and tone controls and one or more loudspeakers or drivers mounted in a portable wooden cabinet. This amp's sound is being picked up with a microphone in a recording studio.]]
Instrument amplifiers are available for specific instruments, including the [[guitar amp|electric guitar]], [[bass amp|electric bass]], [[keyboard amp|electric/electronic keyboards]], and acoustic instruments such as the mandolin and banjo. Some amplifiers are designed for specific styles of music, such as the "traditional"-style "tweed" guitar amplifiers, such as the [[Fender Bassman]] used by [[blues]] and [[country music]] musicians, and the Marshall amplifiers used by hard rock and heavy metal bands.

Unlike [[AV receiver|home "hi-fi" amplifiers]] or [[Public Address system|public address system]]s, which are designed to accurately reproduce the source sound signals with as little harmonic distortion as possible and without changing the tone or equalization (at least not unless the hi-fi owner adjusts it themselves with a [[graphic equalizer]]), instrument amplifiers are often designed to add additional tonal coloration to the original signal, emphasize (or de-emphasize) certain frequencies (most electric guitar amps roll off the very high frequencies), and, in the case of [[guitar amplifier]]s designed for [[electric guitar]] or [[Hammond organ]], offer the capability to intentionally add some degree of "[[distortion (music)|overdrive]]" or distortion to the tone. The two exceptions are [[keyboard amplifier]]s designed for use with [[digital piano]]s and [[synthesizer]]s and "acoustic" instrument amplifiers for use with [[acoustic guitar]] or [[fiddle]] in a [[folk music]] setting, which typically aim for a relatively flat frequency response (i.e., no added colouration of the sound) and little or no distortion of the signal.

==Types==

===Guitar amplifiers===
{{Main|Guitar amplifier}}
[[File:Guitarras de McCartney y Harrison.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Vox AC30]] used by [[The Beatles]]]]
A [[guitar amplifier]] [[amplifier|amplifies]] the electrical signal of an [[electric guitar]] (or, less commonly, with acoustic amplifiers, an [[acoustic guitar]]) so that it can drive a [[loudspeaker]] at sufficient volume for the performer and audience to hear. Most guitar amplifiers can also modify the instrument's with controls that emphasize or de-emphasize certain frequencies and add [[effects unit|electronic effects]]. String vibrations are sensed by a suitable microphone or [[Pick up (music technology)|pickup]], depending on the type of guitar. For electric guitars, strings are almost always made of metal, and the [[Pick up (music technology)|pickup]] works by electro-magnetic induction (these are called magnetic pickups; they are the most widely used type of pickup on electric guitars). Acoustic guitars do not usually have a built-in pickup or microphone, at least with entry-level and beginner instruments. Some acoustic guitars have a small [[condenser microphone]] mounted inside the body, which designed to convert acoustic vibrations into an electrical signal, but usually they do so from direct contact with the strings (replacing the guitar's bridge) or with the guitar's body, rather than having a membrane like general-purpose microphones. Acoustic guitars may also use a [[piezoelectric]] pickup, which converts the vibrations of the instrument into an electronic signal. More rarely, a magnetic pickup may be mounted in the sound hole of an acoustic guitar; while magnetic pickups do not have the same acoustic tone that microphones and piezo pickups can produce, magnetic pickups are more resistant to [[acoustic feedback]].

====Standard amps====
Standard amplifiers, such as the Fender "tweed"-style amps (e.g., the [[Fender Bassman]]) and Gibson amps, are often used by traditional rock, blues, and country musicians who wish to create a "vintage" 1950s-style sound. They are used by electric guitarists, [[pedal steel]] guitar players, and blues [[harmonica]] ("harp") players. Combo amplifiers such as the [[Fender Super Reverb]] have powerful, loud [[tube amplifier]]s, four 10" speakers, and they often have built-in [[Reverberation|reverb]] and "[[Vibrato unit|vibrato]]" effects units. Smaller guitar amps are also available, which have fewer speakers (some have only one speaker) and lighter, less powerful amplifier units. Smaller guitar amps are easier to transport to gigs and [[sound recording]] sessions. Smaller amps are widely used in small venue shows ([[nightclub]]s) and in recordings, because players can obtain the tone they want without having to have an excessively loud volume. One of the challenge with the large, powerful 4x10 Fender Bassman-type amps is that to get the tone a player wants, they have to turn up the amp to a loud volume.

These amps are designed to produce a variety of sounds ranging from a clean, warm sound (when used in country and soft rock) to a growling, natural overdrive, when the volume is set near its maximum, (when used for [[blues]], [[rockabilly]], [[psychobilly]], and [[roots rock]]). These amplifiers usually have a sharp treble [[roll-off]] at 5&amp;nbsp;kHz to reduce the extreme high frequencies, and a bass roll-off at 60–100&amp;nbsp;Hz to reduce unwanted boominess. The nickname "tweed" refers to the lacquered beige-light brown fabric covering used on these amplifiers. 

The smallest "combo" amplifiers, which are mainly used for individual practice and warm-up purposes, may have only a single 8" or 10" speaker. Some harmonica players use these small combo amplifiers for concert performances, though, because it is easier to create natural overdrive with these lower-powered amplifiers. Larger combo amplifiers, with one 12 inch speaker or two or four 10 or 12 inch speakers are used for club performances and larger venues. For large concert venues such as stadiums, performers may also use an amplifier "head" with several separate speaker cabinets (which usually contain two or four 12" speakers).

====Hard rock and heavy metal====
[[File:MarshallStack Slayer.jpg|thumb|A 3×6 stack of mock [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] guitar cabinets for [[Jeff Hanneman]] of [[Slayer]]]]
Electric guitar amplifiers designed for [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] are used to add an aggressive "drive", intensity, and "edge" to the guitar sound with distortion effects, preamplification boost controls (sometimes with multiple stages of preamps), and tone filters. While many of the most expensive, high-end models use 1950s-style [[tube amplifier]]s (even in the 2000s), there are also many models that use [[transistor]] amplifiers, or a mixture of the two technologies (i.e., a tube preamplifier with a transistor [[power amplifier]]). Amplifiers of this type, such as [[Marshall amplifiers]], are used in a range of the louder, heavier genres of rock, including hard rock, [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and [[hardcore punk]]. This type of amplifier is available in a range of formats, ranging from small, self contained combo amplifiers for rehearsal and warm-ups to heavy "heads" that are used with separate speaker cabinets—colloquially referred to as a "stack."

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, [[Public Address system|public address systems]] at rock concerts were used mainly for the vocals. As a result, to get a loud electric guitar sound, early [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and rock-blues bands often used "stacks" of 4x12" Marshall speaker cabinets on the stage. In 1969, [[Jimi Hendrix]] used four stacks to create a powerful lead sound, and in the early 1970s by the band [[Blue Öyster Cult]] used an entire wall of Marshall Amplifiers to create a roaring [[wall of sound]] that projected massive volume and sonic power. In the 1980s, metal bands such as [[Slayer]] and [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] also used "walls" of over 20 Marshall cabinets. However, by the 1980s and 1990s, most of the sound at live concerts was produced by the [[sound reinforcement system]] rather than the onstage guitar amplifiers, so most of these cabinets were not connected to an amplifier. Instead, walls of speaker cabinets were used for aesthetic reasons. 

Amplifiers for harder, heavier genres often use valve amplifiers (known as "tube amplifiers" in North America) also. Valve amplifiers are perceived by musicians and fans to have a "warmer" tone than those of transistor amps, particularly when overdriven (turned up to the level that the amplifier starts to [[clipping (electronics)|clip]] or shear off the wave forms). Instead of abruptly clipping off the signal at cut-off and saturation levels, the signal is rounded off more smoothly. Vacuum tubes also exhibit different harmonic effects than transistors. In contrast to the "tweed"-style amplifiers, which use speakers in an open-backed cabinet, companies such as Marshall tend to use 12" speakers in a closed-back cabinet. These amplifiers usually allow users to switch between "clean" and distorted tones (or a [[rhythm guitar]]-style "crunch" tone and a sustained [[lead guitar|"lead"]] tone) with a foot-operated switch.

[[Image:Bassstack.jpg|thumb|left|100px|A 2 x 10" bass speaker cabinet stacked on top of a 15" cabinet, with separate bass amplifier "head" unit]]

===Bass===
[[Bass instrument amplification|Bass amplifiers]] are designed for [[bass guitar]]s or more rarely, for [[double bass|upright bass]]. They differ from amplifiers for the regular (and comparatively higher-pitched) electric guitar in several respects. They have extended low frequency response and tone controls optimised for bass instruments, which produce pitches of 41&amp;nbsp;Hz, in the case of a standard four-string electric bass or double bass, or even lower for five- or six-string electric basses.

Higher-cost bass amplifiers sometimes include built-in [[bass effects]], which are electronic [[effects unit]]s designed for electric bass or more rarely,  for upright bass. Common built-in effects include [[audio compressor]] or limiter features, which help to keep the amplifier from doing unwanted distorting at high volume levels and potentially damaging the speakers; equalizers; and in some amps from the 1980s and more commonly in the 2000s, [[bass overdrive]]. Bass amps may provide an XLR [[DI unit|DI output]] for plugging the bass amp signal directly into a [[mixing board]] or [[PA system]]. Larger, more powerful bass amplifiers (300 or more watts) are often provided with internal or external metal [[heat sink]]s and/or fans to help keep the amplifier cool. 

Speaker cabinets designed for bass usually use larger [[loudspeakers]] (or more loudspeakers, in the case of the popular 4x10" cabinets, which contain four 10" speakers) than the cabinets used for other instruments, so that they can move the larger amounts of air needed to reproduce low frequencies. Bass players have to use more powerful amplifiers than the electric guitarists, because deep bass frequencies take more power to amplify{{citation needed|reason=Frequency has no bearing on actual amplitude of an amplified signal.|date=December 2016}}. As such, in a band in which the electric guitar player uses a 50 watt guitar amp, the bass player typically uses a 200 watt to 300 watt bass amp. While the largest speakers commonly used for regular electric guitar are 12" speakers, electric bass speaker cabinets often use 15" speakers. Bass players who play styles of music that require an extended low-range response, such as [[death metal]], sometimes use speaker cabinets with 18" speakers or add a large [[subwoofer]] cabinet to their rig.

Speakers for bass instrument amplification tend to be heavier-duty than those for regular electric guitar, and the speaker cabinets are typically more rigidly constructed and heavily braced, to prevent unwanted buzzes and rattles. Bass cabinets often include [[bass reflex]] ports, vents or openings in the cabinet, which improve the bass response and low-end, especially at high volumes.

[[Image:Amplifier1.jpg|thumb|A small keyboard amplifier suitable for at-home practice capable of mixing the inputs from two keyboards.]]

===Keyboard===
A [[keyboard amplifier]], used for the [[stage piano]], [[synthesizer]], [[clonewheel organ]]s and similar instruments, is distinct from other types of amplification systems due to the particular challenges associated with keyboards; namely, to provide solid low-frequency sound reproduction ''and'' crisp high-frequency sound reproduction. It is typically a combination amplifier that contains a two, three, or four-channel [[Electronic mixer|mixer]], a [[pre-amplifier]] for each channel, equalization controls, a [[power amplifier]], a [[Loudspeaker|speaker]], and a [[Horn loudspeaker|horn]], all in a single cabinet.

Notable exceptions include keyboard amplifiers for specific keyboard types. The vintage [[Leslie speaker]] cabinet and modern recreations, which are generally used for [[Hammond organs]],  use a [[tube amplifier]] that is often turned up to add a warm, "growling" [[Overdrive (music)|overdrive]]. Some [[electric piano]]s have built-in amplifiers and speakers, in addition to outputs for external amplification.

===Acoustic amplifiers ===
These amplifiers are intended for acoustic instruments such as [[violin]] ("fiddle"), [[mandolin]], and [[acoustic guitar]]—especially for the way musicians play these instruments in quieter genres such as [[Folk music|folk]] and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. They are similar to keyboard amplifiers, in that they have a relatively flat frequency response and avoid tonal coloration. 

To produce this relatively "clean" sound, these amplifiers often have very powerful amplifiers (up to 800 watts RMS), to provide additional "headroom" and prevent unwanted distortion. Since an 800 watt amplifier built with standard [[Class AB]] technology would be heavy, some acoustic amplifier manufacturers use lightweight [[Class D amplifiers|Class D]], "switching amplifiers."

Acoustic amplifier designs strive to produce a clean, transparent, "acoustic" sound that does not—except for reverb and other effects—alter the natural instrument sound, other than to make it louder. Amplifiers often come with a simple mixer to blend signals from a pickup and microphone. Since the early 2000s, it is increasingly common for acoustic amplifiers to provided digital effects, such as [[reverb]] and [[Gain compression|compression]]. Some also contain [[feedback]]-suppressing devices, such as [[notch filter]]s or [[parametric equalizer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Note: Acoustic amplifiers should not be confused with the amplifier brand name ''[[Acoustic Control Corporation|Acoustic]],'' whose products are still available in the used equipment market.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles==
Instrument amplifiers have a different purpose than 'Hi-Fi' (high fidelity) [[stereo]] amplifiers in radios and home stereo systems. Hi-fi home stereo amplifiers strive to accurately reproduce signals from pre-recorded music, with as little harmonic distortion as possible. In contrast, instrument amplifiers are add additional tonal coloration to the original signal or emphasize certain frequencies. For electric instruments such as electric guitar, the amplifier helps to create the instrument's tone by boosting the input signal gain and distorting the signal, and by emphasizing frequencies deemed desirable (e.g., low frequencies) and de-emphasizing frequencies deemed undesirable (e.g., very high frequencies).

===Size and power rating===
In the 1960s and 1970s, large, heavy, high output power amplifiers were preferred for instrument amplifiers, especially for large concerts, because [[public address system]]s were generally only used to amplify the vocals. Moreover, in the 1960s, PA systems typically did not use monitor speaker systems to amplify the music for the onstage musicians. Instead, the musicians were expected to have instrument amplifiers that were powerful enough to provide amplification for the stage and audience.  In late 1960s and early 1970s rock concerts, bands often used large stacks of speaker cabinets powered by heavy tube amplifiers such as the [[Ampeg SVT|Super Valve Technology (SVT)]] amplifier, which was often used with eight 10" speakers.

However, over subsequent decades, PA systems substantially improved, and used different approaches, such as horn-loaded "bass bins" (in the 1980s) and subwoofers (1990s and 2000s) to amplify bass frequencies. As well, in the 1980s and 1990s, monitor systems substantially improved, which helped sound engineers provide onstage musicians with a better reproduction of their instruments' sound.  

As a result of improvements to PA and monitor systems, musicians in the 2000s no longer need huge, powerful amplifier systems. A small combo amplifier patched into the PA suffices. In the 2000s, virtually all sound reaching the audience in large venues comes from the [[PA system]]. Onstage instrument amplifiers are more likely to be at a low volume, because high volume levels onstage make it harder for the sound engineer to control the sound mix. 

As a result, in many large venues much of the onstage sound reaching the musicians now comes from [[in-ear monitor]]s, not from the instrument amplifiers. While stacks of huge speaker cabinets and amplifiers are still used in concerts (especially in heavy metal), this is often mainly for aesthetics or to create a more authentic tone. The switch to smaller instrument amplifiers makes it easier for musicians to transport their equipment to performances. As well, it makes concert stage management easier at large clubs and festivals where several bands are performing in sequence, because the bands can be moved on and off the stage more quickly.

==Amplifier technology ==
Instrument amplifiers may be based on [[thermionic]] ("tube" or "valve") or [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] (transistor) technology.

===Tube amplifiers===

Vacuum tubes were the dominant active electronic components in amplifiers from the 1930s through the early 1970s, and tube amplifiers remain preferred by many musicians and [[record producer|producers]]. Some musicians feel that tube amplifiers produce a "warmer" or more "natural" sound than solid state units, and a more pleasing [[distortion (music)|overdrive]] sound when overdriven. However, these subjective assessments of the attributes of tube amplifiers' sound qualities are the subject of ongoing debate. Tube amps are more fragile, require more maintenance, and are usually more expensive than solid state amps.

Tube amplifiers produce more heat than solid state amplifiers, but few manufacturers of these units include cooling fans in the chassis. While tube amplifiers do need to attain a proper [[operating temperature]], if the temperature goes above this operating temperature, it may shorten the tubes' lifespan and lead to tonal inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061019054109/http://www.chitown.com/http/music/Musictips.html ''Cool it, man''; Michael "Mac" McCullough.]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Trace Elliot Bonneville rear view.jpg|thumb  |A [[Trace Elliot]] "Bonneville" tube amplifier as seen from the rear view: note the vacuum tubes extending into the wooden cabinet.]]

===Solid-state amplifiers===

By the 1960s and 1970s, semiconductor transistor-based amplifiers began to become more popular because they are less expensive, more resistant to bumps during transportation, lighter-weight, and require less maintenance. In some cases, tube and solid-state technologies are used together in amplifiers. A common setup is the use of a tube preamplifier with a solid-state power amplifier. There are also an increasing range of products that use [[digital signal processing]] and digital [[Amplifier modeling|modeling]] technology to simulate many different combinations of amp and cabinets. 

The output transistors of solid-state amplifiers can be passively cooled by using metal fins called heatsinks to radiate away the heat. For high-wattage amplifiers (over 800 watts), a fan is often used to move air across internal heatsinks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yorkville.com/default.asp?p1=6&amp;p2=17&amp;p_id=25 Power Amplifiers - General Information: Yorkville Sound] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007213736/http://www.yorkville.com/default.asp?p1=6&amp;p2=17&amp;p_id=25 |date=2010-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Hybrid===
The most common hybrid amp design is to use a tube preamp with a solid state [[power amplifier]]. This gives users the pleasing preamp and overdrive tone of a tube amp with the lowered cost, maintenance and weight of a solid state power amp.

The '''International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development''' (ICIMOD) is a regional intergovernmental learning and knowledge sharing centre serving the eight regional member countries of the Hindu Kush Himalayas [http://www.icimod.org/?q=1137]. ICIMOD serves eight regional member countries (RMCs) of the Hindu Kush Himalayan region – [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], and [[Pakistan]] – and the global mountain community. Founded in 1983, ICIMOD is based in [[Lalitpur, Nepal|Lalitpur]], Nepal, and brings together a partnership of its regional member countries, partner institutions, and donors with a commitment for development action to secure a better future for the people and environment of the extended Himalayan region.

==Vision==
Men, women, and children of the Hindu Kush Himalayas enjoy improved well being.

==Mission==
To enable sustainable and resilient mountain development for improved and equitable livelihoods through knowledge and regional cooperation.

==History==

The idea of creating an institution to promote the ecologically sound development of mountainous regions was first discussed at the International Workshop on the Development of Mountain Environment in December 1974 in Munich, Germany, but it was only five years later in 1979 during a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation ([[UNESCO]]) Regional Meeting in Kathmandu, under the framework of the Man and the Biosphere Programme, that concrete commitments were made to establish the Centre. The Government of Nepal offered to host the new institution, and the Governments of Switzerland and the Federal Republic of Germany and UNESCO agreed to act as the founding sponsors. His Majesty’s Government of Nepal and UNESCO signed the agreement that provided the legal basis for establishing the Centre in September 1981 in Paris. The Centre was finally established and inaugurated on 5 December 1983 with its headquarters in Lalitpur, Nepal, and legitimised through an Act of Parliament in Nepal in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ceh.resourcehub.ssrc.org/international-center-for-integrated-mountain-development-icimod/institution_view |publisher=China Environment and Health Resources Hub |title=International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813081415/http://ceh.resourcehub.ssrc.org/international-center-for-integrated-mountain-development-icimod/institution_view |archivedate=2011-08-13 |accessdate=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joint replacement of the hand''' is a procedure that was invented by the Scottish scientist, Dr. Mitchell McGuire. The procedure was considered a major breakthrough in the medical field at the time. However, it is now considered an almost standard operation. The first successful surgery of this kind was conducted on 21 December 1992, in [[New York City]], USA.

This surgical option is reserved for patients with advanced [[arthritis]] or with a hand deformity.

== Arthritic joint replacement ==
Merging of a joint involves removing the joint and surgically "fusing" the joint's end so that the two bones effectively form one solid bone. This [[surgery]] stops all movement at that joint and therefore eliminates the pain.&lt;ref&gt;"Merging of a joint involves removing the joint and surgically "fusing" the joints end so that the two bones effectively form one solid bone. This surgery stops all movement at that joint and therefore eliminates the pain." MedicineNet, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The benefit of fusion is pain relief and the downside is elimination of motion at the fused joint, which can hinder function. Arthritic joint replacements are usually the most effective surgical option in more youthful and active patients. Younger patients may not be candidates for joint replacement because of the increased stress demand on the joints which accompany higher activity levels. This increased stress demand can quickly wear out an artificial joint.

== Deformity joint replacement ==
For those with a hand deformity, the surgical procedure varies slightly. Instead of the joint being removed and replaced with a prosthetic hand, a hand from a donor is used.

Patterson Distinguished Professor of Transportation at the [[Kellogg Graduate School of Management]] at [[Northwestern University]] from 1983 until his death in August 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kmworld.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=9884&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Before joining the [[Kellogg School of Management|Kellogg School]], he held faculty positions at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Prof. Manheim's major area of interest was information technology and its uses strategically, competitively, and organizationally. It included strategy formulation and implementation processes; the management of globally competing organizations; and international transportation and logistics. He was also interested in computer assistance to human problem-solving and decision-making, including decision support systems (DSS) and artificial intelligence.

==Award==
The workflow award is given annually, since 2002, to recognize an individual or a specific group for their "influence, contribution, or distinguished use of workflow systems." The criteria for consideration is based on any significant contribution and not limited to members of the coalition. Both software developers and software end users have finalists and award recipients.

Manheim was a founder of [[Cambridge Systematics]], who in 2001 established a separate awards program called the "Marvin L. Manheim Award" to honor his memory and promote innovation in the field of transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camsys.com/com_news_awards.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328165631/http://camsys.com/com_news_awards.htm |archivedate=2014-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a separate program and not related to the workflow award.

The '''microchip revolution''' had its beginnings with the inventions of [[integrated circuit]] (IC) and the [[microprocessor]], both of which were developed to increase [[computer]] efficiency. 

This in turn caused the much broader [[digital revolution]], one of the most significant occurrences in the [[history]] of [[humankind]].

'''Midwater trawling''' is [[trawling]], or net fishing, at a depth that is higher in the [[water column]] than the bottom of the ocean. It is contrasted with [[bottom trawling]]. Midwater trawling is also known as [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] trawling and bottom trawling as [[benthic]] trawling.
{{externalimage

|image1=[http://www.afma.gov.au/information/students/methods/midwater.htm Midwater trawl]
}}

In midwater trawling, a cone-shaped net can be towed behind a single boat and spread by trawl doors, or it  can be towed behind two boats ([[pair trawling]]) which act as the spreading device. Midwater trawling catches [[pelagic fish]] such as [[anchovies]], [[shrimp]], [[tuna]] and [[mackerel]], whereas bottom trawling targets both bottom living fish ([[groundfish]]) and semi-pelagic fish such as: [[cod]], [[squid]], [[halibut]] and [[Sebastidae|rockfish]].

Whereas [[bottom trawling]] can leave serious incidental damage to the sea bottom in its trail, midwater trawling by contrast is relatively benign.

[[File:Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.jpg|right|thumb|Cape Canaveral Missile Row in 1964]]
'''Missile Row''' was a nickname given in the 1960s to the US Air Force and [[NASA]] launch complexes at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] (CCAFS). Operated by the [[45th Space Wing]] of the [[U.S. Air Force]] since 1949, it was the site of all pre-[[Apollo 8]] manned launches, as well as many other early [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) and NASA launches. For the DoD, it plays a secondary role to [[Vandenberg AFB]] in [[California]], but is the launch site for many NASA unmanned [[space probe]]s, as those spacecraft are typically launched on [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] launchers. Active launch vehicles are in '''bold'''.

Much of the support activity for CCAFS occurs at [[Patrick Air Force Base]] to the south, its reporting base.

'''Monofilament fishing line''' (shortened to just '''mono''') is [[fishing line]] made from a single [[fiber]] of [[plastic]]. Most fishing lines are now monofilament because monofilament fibers are cheap to produce and are produced in a range of diameters which have different [[tensile strength]]s (called "tests" after the process of [[tensile testing]]).  Monofilament line is also manufactured in different colors, such as clear, white, green, blue, red, and fluorescent.

Monofilament is made by melting and mixing [[polymers]] and then [[extrusion|extruding]] the mixture through tiny holes, forming strands of line, which is then spun into spools of various thicknesses. The extrusion process controls not only the thickness of the line but its test as well.

== History ==

[[DuPont]] made public in 1938 that their company had invented [[nylon]].&lt;ref name=nylonHistory&gt;[http://www.caimateriali.org/Eventi/Torino/historynylon.html History of Nylon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621045155/http://www.caimateriali.org/Eventi/Torino/historynylon.html |date=21 June 2008 }} US Patent 2,130,523 'Linear polyamides suitable for spinning into strong pliable fibers', U.S. Patent 2,130,947 'Diamine dicarboxylic acid salt' and U.S. Patent 2,130,948 'Synthetic fibers', all issued 20 September 1938&lt;/ref&gt; This new invention was the first [[synthetic fiber]], fabrics that are commonly used in [[textiles]] today.&lt;ref name=dupontNylon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heritage.dupont.com/touchpoints/tp_1935-2/depth.shtml|title=Dupont Heritage, 1935:Nylon|accessdate=2007-12-31 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071230034727/http://heritage.dupont.com/touchpoints/tp_1935-2/depth.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, DuPont began marketing nylon monofilament fishing lines; however, braided [[Dacron]] lines remained the most used and popular fishing line for the next two decades, as early monofilament line was very stiff or "wiry", and difficult to handle and cast.  Early monofilament did, however, have good knot strength and very low visibility to the fish, creating a small loyal following among fishermen. In 1959 DuPont introduced Stren, a thinner and much softer  monofilament line that could be used in a large range of reels, including newly introduced spinning and spin casting tackle. Stren's monofilament lines soon became a favorite with many fishermen because of its overall ease of use and it spawned a whole host of imitators.

New materials, e.g., Spectra or [[Dyneema]], are finding growing usage as fishing lines. [[Polyvinylidene fluoride]] sold as fluorocarbon is very much like nylon monofilament, but has several advantages. [[Optical density]] is lower, which makes the line less easily discernible. The surface is harder so it is more resistant to sharp fish teeth and [[wear]]. Furthermore, PVDF does not take up water and it is resistant to UV-light. It is denser than nylon, too, which makes it sink faster.

Dyneema is also becoming very popular and it is much stronger, but it is used mostly as a [[braided fishing line]]. Because the elastic stretching is only a fraction of that of nylon monofilament, the contact with fish or bait is more direct. It is often used for deep water fishing from boats because lower diameters are used, which give less resistance to currents, and the low stretch makes bites easily detectable.

==Use==
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}
Monofilament fishing line is used in a huge variety of fishing applications.

Monofilament is not advisable for deepwater fishing, since it can absorb water, resulting in loose knots, and its sensitivity can decrease when it is wet. Monofilament degrades with time and can weaken when exposed to heat, sunlight, and/or salt water. When stored on a spool for a long time, it may come off the fishing reel in coils or loops. It is advisable to change monofilament line at regular intervals to prevent degradation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc-of-fishing.net/fishing-lines/types.asp Types of Fishing Lines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403193646/http://www.abc-of-fishing.net/fishing-lines/types.asp |date=3 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-fishing uses ===

Monofilament fishing line is also used sometimes in [[medicine]] to test the [[sense of touch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalmonofilament.com/html/body_information.htm Medicalmonofilament.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512023632/http://www.medicalmonofilament.com/html/body_information.htm |date=12 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The transparency of monofilament fishing line makes it desirable for [[special effect]]s where objects need to look like they are floating unsupported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/sk/2001a/page3.html Creating Special Effects for ''2001: A Space Odyssey'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been used for [[string trimmer]]s, musical instrument strings, sewing thread and bent in the shape of a staple for use as a septum piercing retainer.

== Environmental impact ==
[[File:Sterna maxima and fishing line 2.jpg|thumb|A bird entangled in monofilament line. It appears as though some of the line may have been ingested.]]
Discarded monofilament lines can present serious [[natural environment|environmental]] problems. These lines are extremely difficult to spot when submerged in water, and [[fish]], [[bird]]s, and other [[marine biology|marine life]] can easily become entangled, causing [[starvation]], [[amputation]], and [[death]]. [[Ingestion]] is also a serious threat to wildlife. Monofilament lines also present a risk to swimmers and [[scuba divers]]. The breakdown of lines, especially in string trimmers, leads to [[microplastics]] which may cause starvation or poisoning of organisms in soil or water.

For these reasons, programs have been started to [[recycle]] fishing line, to keep it out of the environment. Specialized containers have been designed to collect fishing line for recycling.

'''Nearmap''' is an Australian aerial imagery technology and location data company that provides frequently-updated, high-resolution [[aerial imagery]] of 88% of Australia's population, 68% of the US population, and 72% of the New Zealand population.&lt;ref name="spatial"&gt;https://www.spatialsource.com.au/company-industry/nearmap-aerial-imagery-success-story&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hupspot"&gt;https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/1760599/Pdf/025_NEA_NZ%20Capture_4%20May%202017.pdf?t=1522995591561&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, aerial imagery was available mainly to government and large enterprises, as it was quite an expensive and long process. First, a surveying company had to be engaged to take photos of a certain area of interest. Then, the data would be manually processed and stitched together digitally to create aerial maps. Imagery was then delivered on a hard disk. The entire process could take months and was repeated once every few years at best.&lt;ref name="itbrief"&gt;https://itbrief.com.au/story/exclusive-interview-nearmap-competing-google-maps/&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearmap disrupted this model by creating a patented camera system and software pipeline that enables the company to capture aerial photos, stitch them together into seamless digital maps, and publish the content online within days of capture.&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;https://www.smh.com.au/business/investments/mapping-out-a-promising-stock-20130522-2k0hh.html&lt;/ref&gt;
With the cost of capture significantly lower than anything else on the market, Nearmap can update surveys more frequently and at a much lower cost. Its subscription model has effectively made high-quality aerial imagery available to a far wider swath of businesses and government organisations.&lt;ref name="spatial" /&gt; Nearmap captures aerial images frequently, up to six times a year in urban centres, at a resolution of 5.8&amp;nbsp;cm - 7.5&amp;nbsp;cm per pixel or better.&lt;ref name="itbrief" /&gt;
By capturing aerial images with airplanes (as opposed to with satellites), Nearmap is able to solve for potential weather or atmospheric obstructions. The images are quickly processed and streamed to the cloud in a matter of days, where they are available for viewing and analysis on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.&lt;ref name="engineering"&gt;https://www.engineering.com/BIM/ArticleID/16087/Service-Provides-Clear-Orthorectified-and-Current-Images-of-Construction-Site.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearmap provides its high-resolution aerial imagery content as a subscription service to a broad base of customers from diverse industries including construction, engineering, urban planning, insurance, solar, telecom, utilities, and government entities across local, state, and federal agencies. Subscribers use Nearmap to remotely inspect locations for better informed planning and monitoring; evaluate properties and infrastructural assets; and understand historical context at their locations of interest.&lt;ref name="businessnewsaus"&gt;https://www.businessnewsaus.com.au/articles/nearmap-posts-record-half-yearly-growth-in-aerial-mapping-subscriptions.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearmap serves over 8,200 businesses and organisations globally.&lt;ref name="afr"&gt;http://www.afr.com/technology/strengthening-us-market-buoys-nearmap-growth-prospects-20180403-h0ya34&lt;/ref&gt;

== Product ==
Nearmap provides three types of aerial imagery:  Vertical, Panorama, and Measurable Obliques.

Vertical imagery is also known as orthorectified, providing a top-down view of the ground captured at a 90° angle. Orthorectification is a process used to correct the terrain distortion in aerial or satellite images that results from variations in the surface of the Earth and tilt of the satellite or aerial sensor being used to collect the data. This process allows accurate information to be gathered from the images such as distances, angles, and positions.&lt;ref name="engineering" /&gt;

The Nearmap Panorama product provides a seamless mosaic view of locations and features from all four cardinal directions in a single viewing experience. Circumventing the need to switch from one image to another to view content from multiple perspectives, Nearmap Panorama allows users to pan and zoom across a large footprint uninterrupted, allowing information to be reviewed much more quickly.&lt;ref name="engineering" /&gt;

Nearmap's Measurable Obliques allow users to make accurate height measurements of buildings and other ground features. Users can then export these images with the measurements and annotations included, allowing multiple stakeholders to communicate with accurate detail to an entire project team.&lt;ref name="engineering" /&gt;

Nearmap aerial imagery is delivered through an easy-to-use cloud-based interface called MapBrowser™ or through API integrations.&lt;ref name="businesswire"&gt;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170710005274/en/Nearmap-Delivers-New-3-D-Content-Oblique-Imagery&lt;/ref&gt; The MapBrowser web application allows users to easily switch base layers from Vertical to Panorama or Measurable Obliques content. It also allows users to navigate and search Nearmap's library of current and historical content, and includes tools for measuring and analysing locations.&lt;ref name="engineering" /&gt; Nearmap's APIs offer integration with Esri® ArcGIS, Autodesk, CAMA systems, and other leading GIS and CAD applications via standard industry protocols including WMS, WMTS, and TMS.&lt;ref name="businesswire" /&gt; Along with current imagery, Nearmap's online archive offers an extensive gallery of historical imagery; as of 2018, up to 10 years of photographic maps were available for some parts of Australia.&lt;ref name="spatial" /&gt;

== History ==
Nearmap was founded in Perth, Western Australia, by Stuart Nixon in 2008. Nearmap's first capture of aerial imagery dates back to 2007.&lt;ref name="learn"&gt;http://learn.nearmap.com/blog/2018/1/15/celebrating-10-years-of-capturing-reality-a-record-breaking-h1-fy2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the business was acquired by an ASX-listed company Ipernica and it became the primary entity. Nearmap then moved its headquarters from Perth to Sydney.&lt;ref name="afr" /&gt; In 2014, the company expanded into the United States market.&lt;ref name="spatial" /&gt; In 2017, Nearmap expanded its capture program and surveyed New Zealand's top 13 most populated cities, plus Queenstown.&lt;ref name="content"&gt;http://www.content-technology.com/newsoperations/?p=629&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="finance"&gt;https://finance.nine.com.au/2017/05/05/06/07/nearmap-launches-nz-pilot-capture-program&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Nearmap expanded its aerial imaging content to provide 3D models of Australia's major capital cities. The business now offers DSM and textured mesh data sets for bespoke download.&lt;ref name="afr" /&gt;

'''Over-the-counter data''' (OTCD) is a design approach used in [[data system]]s, particularly [[educational technology]] data systems, in order to increase the accuracy of users' data analyses by better [[reporting data]].&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, J. G. (2013, June 3). Featured article: What data reporting systems can learn from medicine labeling. ''EdSurge''. Retrieved from https://www.edsurge.com/n/2013-06-03-opinion-what-data-reporting-systems-can-learn-from-medicine-labeling&lt;/ref&gt; The approach involves adhering to standards that are organized by five components: Label, Supplemental Documentation, Help System, Package/Display, and Content.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, J. (2013, October 24). Remedying educators’ data analysis errors with over-the-counter data. ''California Council on Teacher Education (CCTE) Conference''. Poster presentation conducted from Kona Kai Resort, San Diego, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

OTCD was inspired by the varied ways [[over-the-counter medication]] supports those using its contents.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, J. G. (2013, May 2). Over-the-counter data is the next frontier for data in edtech. ''Edukwest''. Retrieved from http://www.edukwest.com/over-the-counter-data-is-the-next-frontier-for-data-in-edtech/&lt;/ref&gt; Just as it would be negligent for over-the-counter medication to contain no labeling, documentation, or other supports helping people to use its contents safely, it is deemed negligent for data systems to display data for educators without providing them with the necessary supports to best ensure it is used correctly when educators use the data to treat students’ needs.

==Background==

Inspired by the varied ways over-the-counter medication supports those using its contents, OTCD was created in 2010 and applied to the improvement of education data systems.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, J. (2011, December 1). Data analysis doesn’t have to be so hard. ''Ninetieth Annual California Educational Research Association (CERA) Conference'' Presentation conducted from Disney Convention Center, Anaheim, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Consider the way in which the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires over-the-counter medication to be accompanied by textual guidance proven to improve its use, deeming it negligent to do otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;DeWalt, D. A. (2010). Ensuring safe and effective use of medication and health care: perfecting the dismount. ''The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), 304''(23), 2641-2642. doi: 10.1001/jama.2010.1844&lt;/ref&gt; With such guidance, patients may take over-the-counter medication with the goal of improving wellbeing while a doctor is not present to explain how to use the medication. No or poor medication labels have resulted in many errors and tragedy, as people are left with no way to know how to use the contents wisely.&lt;ref&gt;Brown-Brumfield, D., &amp; DeLeon, A. (2010). Adherence to a medication safety protocol: Current practice for labeling medications and solutions on the sterile field. ''Association of Operating Room Nurses. AORN Journal, 91''(5), 610-610-7. doi:10.1016/j.aorn.2010.03.002&lt;/ref&gt;

Labeling conventions can translate to improved understanding on non-medication products, as well.&lt;ref&gt;Hampton, T. (2007). Groups urge warning label for medical devices containing toxic chemical. ''The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), 298'' (11), 1267. doi: 10.1001/jama.298.11.1267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qin, Y., Wu, M., Pan, X., Xiang, Q., Huang, J., Gu, Z., &amp; ... Zhou, M. (2011, February 25). Reactions of Chinese adults to warning labels on cigarette packages: a survey in Jiangsu Province. ''BMC Public Health, 11''(133). doi: 10.1186/1471-2458-11-133&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in the way over-the-counter medicine’s proper use is communicated with a thorough label and added documentation, a data system used to analyze student performance can include components to help users better comprehend the data it contains.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, J. G. (2013, October 25). Pushing edtech’s responsibility to communicate feedback effectively. ''Edtech Women''. Retrieved from http://edtechwomen.com/blog/2013/10/25/pushing-edtechs-responsibility-to-communicate-feedback-effectively&lt;/ref&gt; Using an OTCD approach (i.e., following OTCD Standards) when communicating data involves following research-based recommendations likely to improve educators’ understanding, analysis, and use of the data being displayed.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, J. (2013, May 7). Over-the-counter data: Improved analysis accuracy. ''Connect 2013: Canada’s Learning &amp; Technology Conference''.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! OTCD Component !! Appearance in Over-the-Counter Medication !! Appearance in Data Systems &amp; Their Reports
|-
| '''Label'''|| The container label provides the name and info to questions like, "How many should I take?" and "What are the possible side effects?", etc.|| The report has a clear and concise title, and included in the footer or side are annotations that provide info most relevant and important to the report.
|-
| '''Supplemental Documentation'''|| Not all the info a user needs to know can fit on the label, so a folded-up piece of paper is enclosed within the package to offer further explanation.|| Similarly, explanatory info can accompany each report via links to a reference sheet and reference guide specific to each report.
|-
| '''Help System'''|| Users want an online help system to explore and discuss specific questions (50 million people use WebMD every year&lt;ref&gt;Kronstadt, J., Moiduddin, A., &amp; Sellheim, W. (March, 2009). ''Consumer use of computerized applications to address health and health care needs: Prepared for U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Secretary, Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation''. Bethesda, MD: NORC at the University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;). || An online help system can offer comprehensive lessons on using the system and on data analysis (specific to the data).
|-
| '''Package/Display'''|| How the product is displayed and packaged helps communicate by clearly identifying the most important info, such as purpose and use.|| How data is organized and displayed, such as layout that encourages correct analyses for each particular report, helps to avoid confusion.
|-
| '''Content'''|| The ingredients of the product are vital; they have to be effective, user-appropriate, and not expired.|| The contents of each report and the report suite as a whole are effective, audience-appropriate and not expired.
|}

Nonetheless, labeling and tools within data systems to assist analyses are uncommon, even though most educators analyze data alone.&lt;ref name="USDEOPEPD2009"&gt;U.S. Department of Education Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development (2009). ''Implementing data-informed decision making in schools: Teacher access, supports and use.'' United States Department of Education (ERIC Document Reproduction Service No. ED504191)&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, data systems and reports do not commonly present data in an “over-the-counter” format for educators, whose primary option for using data to treat students is thus compared to ingesting medicine from an unmarked or marginally marked container.
Just as it would be negligent for over-the-counter medicine to contain no labeling, documentation, or other supports helping people to use its contents safely, it is negligent for data systems and reports to display data for educators without providing necessary supports to best ensure the data is used appropriately and thus has a ''desirable'' impact on students.&lt;ref name= "RankinStudy"&gt;Rankin, J. G. (2013). ''Over-the-counter data’s impact on educators’ data analysis accuracy''. ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, 3575082. Retrieved from http://pqdtopen.proquest.com/doc/1459258514.html?FMT=ABS&lt;/ref&gt;

The recommendations summarized by OTCD Standards (below) are based on research in [[education]] and [[edtech]], as well as research in a variety of other fields (e.g., [[behavioral economics]], [[design]], [[business analytics]], [[technology]], and more). An OTCD approach is not meant to replace educators’ [[professional development]] or other interventions that improve data use, but it is an added solution that doesn’t cost educators more time, money, or stress.&lt;ref name="RankinStudy" /&gt;

==Significance==

Educators have widely accepted the importance of using data to inform their treatment of students’ needs.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Meij, H. (2008). Designing for user cognition and affect in a manual. Should there be special support for the latter? ''Learning &amp; Instruction, 18''(1), 18-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hattie, J. (2010). Visibly learning from reports: The validity of score reports.

Thus educators are using data to inform decisions, but they do not always understand the data they are using. Since their data-misinformed decisions impact the students such decisions are meant to impact, this is a significant problem. Edtech products that present data to educators in an over-the-counter format – as opposed to simply “showing the data” and requiring educators to dig up resources to aid analyses – play an active role in improving educators’ data use.

==Over-the-Counter Data Study==

[[File:Infographic of OTCD study created by J. G. Rankin, 2013.jpg|thumb|alt=Diagram of over-the-counter data components|Infographic of OTCD study]]
Though numerous studies over the years have produced evidence on which the OTCD standards are based, one quantitative study in 2013 focused specifically on OTCD’s direct impact on data analysis accuracy (as opposed to merely determining which edtech aspects educators prefer). 211 educators of varied backgrounds at nine schools in six different California school districts participated in the ''Over-the-Counter Data’s Impact on Educators’ Data Analysis Accuracy'' study.&lt;ref name="RankinStudy" /&gt; The study’s premise was to determine the precise impact on analysis accuracy when data system reporting environments made data “over-the-counter,” giving educators embedded supports like the kind over-the-counter medication provides for users in the form of labeling and supplemental documentation. Key findings were significant and hold implications for educators, [[educational technology]] and/or [[data system]] vendors, and anyone else involved in communicating data to educators:&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, L., &amp; Johnson, M. (2013, July 24) Data-Informed Decision Making: It Takes a City. Learning Forward (formerly National Staff Development Council) 2013 Summer Conference. Presentation conducted from Minneapolis Hilton, Minneapolis, MN&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Relating to primary research questions'''

* When a footer was present on education data reports viewed by study participants, educators’ analyses of displayed data were 307% more accurate. When participants specifically ''indicated'' having used the footer (73% of the time), their data analyses were 336% more accurate.
* When a reference sheet (following [http://www.overthecounterdata.com/templates templates]) accompanied data reports viewed by study participants, educators’ analyses of displayed data were 205% more accurate. When participants specifically ''indicated'' having used the sheet (50% of the time), their data analyses were 300% more accurate.
* When a reference guide (following [http://www.overthecounterdata.com/templates templates]) accompanied data reports viewed by study participants, educators’ analyses of displayed data were 273% more accurate. When participants specifically ''indicated'' having used the guide (52% of the time), their data analyses were 436% more accurate.
* Overall, when any OTCD support accompanied data reports viewed by study participants, educators’ analyses of displayed data were 264% more accurate. When participants specifically ''indicated'' having used the support (58% of the time), their data analyses were 355% more accurate.
* 87% of the study participants who received no supports indicated they would have used supports – like footers, reference sheets, or reference guides – if the supports had been available.
* Participants who received no supports averaged 11% data analysis accuracy (i.e., a score of 11% correct when answering varied data analysis questions such as, according to the viewed data, which area is most likely a site strength, which area is most likely a site weakness, which students did not score ''Proficient'' on the test, and which areas caused students to not score ''Proficient'' on the test).

'''Relating to Secondary Research Questions'''

* Educators’ school site demographics (secondary independent variables: school level type, school level, academic performance, EL population, Socioeconomically Disadvantaged population, and Students with Disabilities population) had no significant impact on data analysis accuracy or support use.
* Educator demographics (secondary independent variables: veteran status, current professional role, perception of own data analysis proficiency, data analysis [[professional development]] time, and number of graduate-level educational measurement courses) had no significant impact on data analysis accuracy or support use.
* Minor variations in each support’s framing/format (mainly in terms of length and color usage) had no significant impact on data analysis accuracy or support use.

==Over-the-Counter Data (OTCD) Standards==

OTCD Standards involve embedding data analysis supports directly within reporting environments and adhering to best practices concerning design.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, J. (2013, March 28). How data systems &amp; reports can either fight or propagate the data analysis error epidemic. ''2013 Technology Information Center for Administrative Leadership (TICAL) School Leadership Summit''. Retrieved from http://admin20.org/forum/topics/how-data-systems-reports-can-either-fight-or-propagate-the-data&lt;/ref&gt; OTCD Standards were designed to be used by anyone communicating data to educators and to be reflected in the tool(s) through which the data is communicated (e.g., data report, data system, or other [[edtech]] product with a data component). Their purpose is to foster optimal educator (“user”) understanding, analysis, and use of the data being provided.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5580">[[File:PAUL - Portable Aqua Unit for Lifesaving.jpg|thumb|upright|Water backpack "PAUL"]]
The '''Portable Aqua Unit for Lifesaving''' (short '''PAUL'''), also known as Water Backpack is a portable membrane water filter  developed at the [[University of Kassel]] for humanitarian aid. It allows the decentralized supply of clean water in emergency and disaster situations.

== Technology ==

=== Prerequisites ===
[[File:Pictograms PAUL.jpg|thumb|450px|thumbnail images PAUL]]

The filter only needs water (e.g. from wells or rivers), to function. There are neither chemicals nor energy nor trained personnel required. The entire operation is shown in four pictograms, so that it can be operated without any prior knowledge, as a test with different population groups in India has shown.

=== Operation ===
The core of the device is a [[Membrane technology|membrane filter]] unit. After it is set up at its destination, it is filled with about 100 litres of raw water from surface waters. After a waiting period of one to two minutes the filtered water flows out of the drain hose. During filtering raw water must be replenished continuously .

=== Performance ===
At about 1.15 metres of water pressure, the water is filtered through the membrane with a pore size of 20 to 100 [[Nanometre|nm]]. The device removes bacteria with an efficiency of 99.999% (measurement Institut Fresenius, [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] and [[Coliform bacteria|Coliform]]) and viruses to 99.9% (measured Bonn University, [[coliphages]]).
A system based on [[ultrafiltration]] system (unlike [[Reverse osmosis]] based units) is not able to filter out solutes like salts or liquids like mineral oils. They pass through the membrane. Water contaminated with such substances therefore can not be cleaned.

A device with an average supply of 1200 litres of raw water can, according to the [[Sphere Project|Sphere]] standards (2011)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sphereproject.org/resources/download-publications/?search=1&amp;keywords=&amp;language=German&amp;type=0&amp;category=22 The Sphere Project: The Sphere Handbook], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;, supply clean, drinkable water for 400 people per day.

== Use and dissemination ==
The water filter is designed for use in emergency and disaster situations. As a backpack it can, if necessary, be brought by walking to the locations. It first came in March 2010 to use in Chile. Since September 2010, the spread increased significantly so that in April 2012, about 700 copies in over 30 countries worldwide.

As the lifespan of the membrane is around ten years, aid agencies can leave the device after a disaster on site. Regular servicing or cleaning of the filter every few months is recommended, and depending on the degree of contamination of the raw water necessary. To clean it the backpack is to be filled once completely and then emptied through the bottom outlet to flush the sediments out.

PAUL is beside the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|German Foreign Office]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/sid_053FD3BE66C470F16ADDA7A55F3F1B4E/DE/Aussenpolitik/HumanitaereHilfe/AktuelleArtikel/111027-Flut-Suedostasien-node.html Tsunami in Southeast Asia (German)]&lt;/ref&gt; used by many organizations in humanitarian relief.

== Development ==
The device was developed in the Department of Urban Water Management in the Department of [[Civil Engineering]] at the [[University of Kassel]] under the "German Federal Environmental Foundation" funded projects. The current optimization project will run until mid-2013 in a research project.

== Awards ==
The project "PAUL - Potable water at disasters" in 2011 at the German competition "365 Landmarks in the Land of Ideas" as the national winner in the Category Society Competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.land-der-ideen.de/presse/meldung/wettbewerb-365-orte-im-land-ideen-bundes-und-publikumssieger-2011-feierlich-geehrt Competition "365 Landmarks in the Land of Ideas" Federal and solemnly honored audience Winner 2011 (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regenerative receiver==
[[File:Armstrong regenerative receiver circuit.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Vacuum tube regenerative receiver schematic. Most regenerative receivers used this [[Armstrong oscillator|Armstrong circuit]], in which the feedback was applied to the input (grid) of the tube with a "tickler coil" winding on the tuning inductor.]]

The [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] of any amplifying device, such as a [[vacuum tube]], [[transistor]], or [[op amp]], can be increased by feeding some of the energy from its output back into its input in phase with the original input signal. This is called [[positive feedback]] or ''regeneration''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj7p.org/Manuals/PDFs/Books/Sturley_1.pdf K. R. Sturley, ''Radio Receiver Design'' (Part I), New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1943, p. 392]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Everitt01/&gt;.  Because of the large amplification possible with regeneration, regenerative receivers often use only a single amplifying element (tube or transistor). In a regenerative receiver the output of the tube or transistor is connected back to its own input through a [[tuned circuit]] (LC circuit)&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Circuits_and_Tubes_Cruft_Laboratory_at_Harvard_University_1947#page/n763 Cruft Electronics Staff, ''Electronic Circuits and Tubes'', New York: McGraw-Hill, 1947, pp. 741 - 744] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="robinson"&gt;H. A. Robinson, "Regenerative Detectors", ''[[QST]]'', vol. XVII, no. 2, p. 26, Feb. 1933&lt;/ref&gt;.  The tuned circuit allows positive feedback only at its [[resonant frequency]]. In regenerative receivers using only one active device, the same tuned circuit is coupled to the antenna and also serves to select the radio frequency to be received, usually by means of variable capacitance. In the regenerative circuit discussed here, the active device also functions as a [[grid-leak detector|detector]]; this circuit is also known as a ''regenerative detector''&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt;. A regeneration control is usually provided for adjusting the amount of feedback (the [[loop gain]]). It is desirable for the circuit design to provide regeneration control that can gradually increase feedback to the point of oscillation and that provides control of the oscillation from small to larger amplitude and back to no oscillation without jumps of amplitude or hysteresis in control&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Experimental%20Wireless/40s/Wireless-Engineer-1946-08.pdf E. E. Zepler, "Oscillation Hysteresis in Grid Detectors", ''Wireless Engineer'', vol. XXIII, no. 275, Aug. 1946, p. 222]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Circuits_and_Tubes_Cruft_Laboratory_at_Harvard_University_1947#page/n765 Cruft Electronics Staff, 1947, p. 743]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. E. Zepler, ''The Technique of Radio Design'', 2nd ed., New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1951, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;.

Two important attributes of a radio receiver are ''sensitivity'' and ''selectivity''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Circuits_and_Tubes_Cruft_Laboratory_at_Harvard_University_1947#page/n763 Cruft Electronics Staff, 1947, p. 741]&lt;/ref&gt;. The regenerative detector provides sensitivity and selectivity due to voltage amplification and the characteristics of a resonant circuit consisting of inductance and capacitance. The regenerative voltage amplification &lt;math&gt;u_{\mathrm{o}}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;u_{\mathrm{o}} = u / (1-ua)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the non-regenerative amplification and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the portion of the output signal fed back to the L2 C2 circuit. As &lt;math&gt;1-ua&lt;/math&gt; becomes smaller the amplification increases&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/CommunicationEngineering/Everitt-CommunicationEngineering#page/n473 W. L. Everitt, 1937, p. 464]&lt;/ref&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; of the tuned circuit (L2 C2) without regeneration is &lt;math&gt;Q=X_{\mathrm{L}}/R&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X_{\mathrm{L}}&lt;/math&gt; is the reactance of the coil and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; represents the total dissipative loss of the tuned circuit. The positive feedback compensates the energy loss caused by &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, so it may be viewed as introducing a negative resistance &lt;math&gt;R_{\mathrm{r}}&lt;/math&gt; to the tuned circuit&lt;ref name="cruft283"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Circuits_and_Tubes_Cruft_Laboratory_at_Harvard_University_1947#page/n765 Cruft Electronics Staff, 1947, p. 743]&lt;/ref&gt;. The &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; of the tuned circuit with regeneration is &lt;math&gt;Q_{\mathrm{reg}} = X_{\mathrm{L}}/(R-|R_{\mathrm{r}}|)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Circuits_and_Tubes_Cruft_Laboratory_at_Harvard_University_1947#page/n765 Cruft Electronics Staff, 1947, p. 743]&lt;/ref&gt;. The regeneration increases the &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;. Oscillation begins when &lt;math&gt;|R_{\mathrm{r}}|=R&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="cruft283"/&gt;.

Regeneration can increase the detection gain of a detector by a factor of 1,700 or more. This is quite an improvement, especially for the low-gain vacuum tubes of the 1920s and early 1930s.  The type 36 screen-grid tube (obsolete since the mid-1930s) had a non-regenerative detection gain (audio frequency plate voltage divided by radio frequency input voltage) of only 9.2 at 7.2&amp;nbsp;MHz, but in a regenerative detector, had detection gain as high as 7,900 at critical regeneration (non-oscillating) and as high as 15,800 with regeneration just above critical&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt;. The "... non-oscillating regenerative amplification is limited by the stability of the circuit elements, tube [or device] characteristics and [stability of] supply voltages which determine the maximum value of regeneration obtainable without self-oscillation"&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt;.  Intrinsically, there is little or no difference in the gain and stability available from vacuum tubes, JFETs, MOSFETs or bipolar junction transistors (BJTs).

A major improvement in stability and a small improvement in available gain for reception of CW radiotelegraphy is provided by the use of a separate oscillator, known as a ''heterodyne oscillator'' or ''beat oscillator''&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="talbert"&gt;R. J. Talbert, "The Simple Regenerative Receiver with Separate Beat Oscillator", ''[[QST]]'',  vol. XX, no. 2, p. 15, Feb. 1936&lt;/ref&gt;. Providing the oscillation separately from the detector allows the regenerative detector to be set for maximum gain and selectivity - which is always in the non-oscillating condition&lt;ref name="robinson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="decola"/&gt;. Interaction between the detector and the beat oscillator can be minimized by operating the beat oscillator at half of the receiver operating frequency, using the second harmonic of the beat oscillator in the detector&lt;ref name="talbert"/&gt;.

===AM reception===
For [[amplitude modulation|AM]] reception, the gain of the loop is adjusted so it is just below the level required for [[oscillation]] (a loop gain of just less than one).  The result of this is to greatly increase the gain of the amplifier at the bandpass frequency (resonant frequency), while not increasing it at other frequencies.   So the incoming radio signal is amplified by a large factor, 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; - 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, increasing the receiver's sensitivity to weak signals.  The high gain also has the effect of reducing the circuit's [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] (increasing the [[Q factor|Q]]) by an equal factor, increasing the [[Electronic selectivity|selectivity]] of the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Radio Amateur's Handbook|year=1978|publisher=[[American Radio Relay League]]|pages=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CW reception (autodyne mode)===
{{main|Autodyne}}
For the reception of [[Continuous wave|CW]] [[radiotelegraphy]] ([[Morse code]]), the feedback is increased just to the point of oscillation. The tuned circuit is adjusted to provide typically 400 to 1000 Hertz difference between the receiver oscillation frequency and the desired transmitting station's signal frequency. The two frequencies [[beat frequency|''beat'']] in the nonlinear amplifier, generating [[heterodyne]] or ''beat'' frequencies&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/principlesunderl00unitrich#page/502/mode/2up Signal Corps U.S. Army, ''The Principles Underlying Radio Communication'', 2nd ed. Washington, DC: U.S.G.P.O., 1922, p. 501]&lt;/ref&gt;. The difference frequency, typically 400 to 1000 Hertz, is in the audio range; so it is heard as a tone in the receiver's speaker whenever the station's signal is present.

Demodulation of a signal in this manner, by use of a single amplifying device as oscillator and [[Frequency_mixer|mixer]] simultaneously, is known as ''autodyne'' reception&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/principlesunderl00unitrich#page/502/mode/2up Signal Corps U.S. Army, 1922, p. 503]&lt;/ref&gt;. The term ''autodyne'' predates multigrid tubes and is not applied to use of tubes specifically designed for frequency conversion.

===SSB reception===
For the reception of [[Single-sideband modulation|single-sideband]] (SSB) signals, the circuit is also adjusted to oscillate as in CW reception. The tuning is adjusted until the demodulated voice is intelligible.

=== Advantages and disadvantages ===
Regenerative receivers require fewer components than other types of receiver circuit, such as the [[Tuned radio frequency receiver|TRF]] and [[superheterodyne]].  The circuit's advantage was that it got much more amplification (gain) out of the expensive [[vacuum tube]]s, thus reducing the number of tubes required and therefore the cost of a receiver.  Early vacuum tubes had low gain and tended to oscillate at [[Radio frequency|radio frequencies]] (RF). TRF receivers often required 5 or 6 tubes; each stage requiring tuning and neutralization, making the receiver cumbersome, power hungry, and hard to adjust.  A regenerative receiver, by contrast, could often provide adequate reception with the use of only one tube.  In the 1930s the regenerative receiver was replaced by the superheterodyne circuit in commercial receivers due to the superheterodyne's superior performance and the falling cost of tubes.  Since the advent of the [[transistor]] in 1946, the low cost of active devices has removed most of the advantage of the circuit.  However, in recent years the regenerative circuit has seen a modest comeback in receivers for low cost [[digital radio]] applications such as [[garage door opener]]s, [[keyless entry|keyless locks]], [[RFID]] readers and some [[cell phone]] receivers.

A disadvantage of this receiver, especially in designs that couple the detector tuned circuit to the antenna, is that the regeneration (feedback) level must be adjusted when the receiver is tuned to a different frequency. The antenna impedance varies with frequency, changing the loading of the input tuned circuit by the antenna, requiring the regeneration to be adjusted. In addition, the Q of the detector tuned circuit components vary with frequency, requiring adjustment of the regeneration control.&lt;ref name="TM11-665" /&gt;{{rp|p.189}}

A disadvantage of the single active device regenerative detector in autodyne operation is that the local oscillation causes the operating point to move significantly away from the ideal operating point, resulting in the detection gain being reduced.&lt;ref name="decola"&gt;R. De Cola, "Increased Sensitivity With the Regenerative Detector", ''[[QST]]'', vol. XVIII, no. 12, p. 24, Dec. 1934&lt;/ref&gt;.

Another drawback is that when the circuit is adjusted to oscillate it can radiate a signal from its antenna, so it can cause [[Radio-frequency interference|interference]] to other nearby receivers. Adding an RF amplifier stage between the antenna and the regenerative detector can reduce unwanted radiation, but would add expense and complexity.

Other shortcomings of regenerative receivers are the sensitive and unstable tuning. These problems have the same cause: a regenerative receiver’s gain is greatest when it operates on the verge of oscillation, and in that condition, the circuit behaves [[chaos theory|chaotically]].&lt;ref&gt;Domine M.W. Leenaerts and Wim M.G. van Bokhoven, “Amplification via chaos in regenerative detectors,” ''Proceedings of SPIE'' *, vol. 2612**, pages 136-145 (December 1995).

Leenaerts, “Chaotic behavior in superregenerative detectors,” ''IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems Part 1: Fundamental Theory and Applications'', vol. 43, no. 3, pages 169-176 (March 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1922, during his development of the superregenerative receiver, [[Edwin Howard Armstrong|Edwin Armstrong]] noted signs of chaotic behavior in his circuits.  See:  Edwin H. Armstrong (1922) [https://books.google.com/books?id=xUISAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA244#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Some recent developments of regenerative circuits,"] ''Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers'', '''10''' (8) :  244-260.  From p. 252: " … a free oscillation starts every time the resistance of the circuit becomes negative. … The free oscillations produced in the system when no signaling emf. is impressed, must be initiated by some irregularity of operation of the vacuum tubes, … ."&lt;/ref&gt; Simple regenerative receivers electrically couple the antenna to the detector tuned circuit, resulting in the electrical characteristics of the antenna influencing the resonant frequency of the detector tuned circuit. Any movement of the antenna or large objects near the antenna can change the tuning of the detector.

===History===
The inventor of [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio, [[Edwin Armstrong]], invented and patented the regenerative circuit while he was a junior in college, in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  |title=The Armstrong Patent |date=May 1922 |journal=Radio Broadcast |location=Garden City, NY |publisher=Doubleday, Page &amp; Co. |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=71&amp;ndash;72 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VMcnAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He patented the superregenerative circuit in 1922, and the [[superheterodyne]] receiver in 1918.

[[Lee De Forest]] filed a patent in 1916 that became the cause of a contentious lawsuit with the prolific inventor Armstrong, whose patent for the regenerative circuit had been issued in 1914. The lawsuit lasted twelve years, winding its way through the appeals process and ending up at the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Armstrong won the first case, lost the second, stalemated at the third, and then lost the final round at the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morse|1925|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time the regenerative receiver was introduced, [[vacuum tube]]s were expensive and consumed lots of power, with the added expense and encumbrance of heavy batteries. So this design, getting most gain out of one tube, filled the needs of the growing radio community and immediately thrived. Although the superheterodyne receiver is the most common receiver in use today, the regenerative radio made the most out of very few parts.

In World War II the regenerative circuit was used in some military equipment. An example is the German field radio "Torn.E.b".&lt;ref&gt;{{lang-de|Tornisterfunkgerät}} = [[Joint Tactical Radio System#JTRS Handheld, Manpack &amp; Small Form Fit (HMS)|Manpack]] radio&lt;/ref&gt; Regenerative receivers needed far fewer tubes and less power consumption for nearly equivalent performance.

A related circuit, the ''superregenerative detector'', found several highly important military uses in World War II in  [[Secondary surveillance radar|Friend or Foe]] identification equipment and in the top-secret [[proximity fuze]]. An example here is the miniature RK61 [[thyratron]] marketed in 1938, which was designed specifically to operate like a [[Triode|vacuum triode]] below its ignition voltage, allowing it to amplify analog signals as a self-quenching superregenerative detector in [[radio control]] receivers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/138/r/RK61.pdf |title=''Subminiature gas triode type RK61'' data sheet |publisher=[[Raytheon|Raytheon Company]] |format=PDF |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the major technical development which led to the wartime development of radio-controlled weapons and the parallel development of [[radio-controlled models|radio controlled modelling]] as a hobby.&lt;ref name=Honnest-Redlich&gt;George Honnest-Redlich ''Radio Control for Models (1950)'' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the [[superheterodyne]] design began to gradually supplant the regenerative receiver, as tubes became far less expensive. In Germany the design was still used in the millions of mass-produced German "peoples receivers" ([[Volksempfänger]]) and "German small receivers" (DKE, Deutscher Kleinempfänger). Even after WWII, the regenerative design was still present in early after-war German minimal designs along the lines of the "peoples receivers" and "small receivers", dictated by lack of materials. Frequently German military tubes like the "RV12P2000" were employed in such designs. There were even superheterodyne designs, which used the regenerative receiver as a combined IF and demodulator with fixed regeneration. The superregenerative design was also present in early FM broadcast receivers around 1950. Later it was almost completely phased out of mass production, remaining only in hobby kits, and some special applications, like gate openers.

==Superregenerative receiver==
[[File:Edwin Armstrong and superregenerative receiver.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Edwin Armstrong presenting the superregenerative receiver at the June 28, 1922 meeting of the Radio Club of America in Havemeyer Hall, Columbia University, New York.  His prototype 3 tube receiver was as sensitive as conventional receivers with 9 tubes.]]

The superregenerative receiver uses a second lower-frequency oscillation ([[Squegging|within the same stage]] or by using a second oscillator stage) to provide single-device circuit gains of around one million. This second oscillation periodically interrupts or "quenches" the main RF oscillation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Electronic_Circuits_and_Tubes_Cruft_Laboratory_at_Harvard_University_1947#page/n765 Cruft Electronics Staff, 1947, p. 744]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ultrasonic quench rates between 30 and 100&amp;nbsp;kHz are typical. After each quenching, RF oscillation grows exponentially, starting from the tiny energy picked up by the antenna plus circuit noise. The amplitude reached at the end of the quench cycle (linear mode) or the time taken to reach limiting amplitude (log mode) depends on the strength of the received signal from which exponential growth started.  A [[low-pass filter]] in the audio amplifier filters the quench and RF frequencies from the output, leaving the AM modulation. This provides a crude but very effective automatic gain control (AGC).

===Advantages and applications===
Superregenerative detectors work well for wide-band signals such as FM, where they perform "slope detection". Regenerative detectors work well for narrow-band signals, especially for CW and SSB which need a heterodyne oscillator or BFO. A superregenerative detector does not have a usable heterodyne oscillator – even though the superregen always self-oscillates, so CW (Morse code)and SSB (single side band) signals can't be received properly.

Superregeneration is most valuable above 27&amp;nbsp;MHz, and for signals where broad tuning is desirable.  The superregen uses many fewer components for nearly the same sensitivity as more complex designs. It is easily possible to build superregen receivers which operate at microwatt power levels, in the 30 to 6,000&amp;nbsp;MHz range. It removes the need for the operator to manually adjust regeneration level to just below the point of oscillation - the circuit automatically is taken out of oscillation periodically, but with the disadvantage that small amounts of interference may be a problem for others. These are ideal for remote-sensing applications or where long battery life is important. For many years, superregenerative circuits have been used for commercial products such as garage-door openers, radar detectors, microwatt RF data links, and very low cost walkie-talkies.

Because the superregenerative detectors tend to receive the strongest signal and ignore other signals in the nearby spectrum, the superregen works best with bands that are relatively free of interfering signals. Due to [[Nyquist theorem|Nyquist's theorem]], its quenching frequency must be at least twice the signal bandwidth. But quenching with overtones acts further as a [[heterodyne]] receiver mixing additional unneeded signals from those bands into the working frequency. Thus the overall bandwidth of superregenerator cannot be less than 4 times that of the quench frequency, assuming the quenching oscillator produces an ideal sine wave.

[[File:'Remove before flight' tag on Concorde F-BVFA.jpg|right|thumb|A ''remove before flight'' ribbon on [[Concorde]] landing gear]]
'''Remove before flight''' is a safety warning often seen on removable [[aircraft]] and [[spacecraft]] components, typically in the form of a red ribbon, to indicate that a device, such as a protective cover or a pin to prevent the movement of mechanical parts, is only used when the aircraft is on the ground (parked or taxiing). On small general aviation aircraft, this may include a [[pitot tube]] cover or a control lock. The warning appears in English only. Similar ribbons labelled "pull to arm" or similar are found on missiles and other weapon systems that are not mounted on aircraft. 

Remove before flight components are often referred to as "red tag items". Typically, the ground crew will have a checklist of remove before flight items. Some checklists will require the ribbon or tag to be attached to the checklist to verify it has been removed. In some cases, non-removal of a labelled part has caused airplane crashes, like that of [[Aeroperú Flight 603]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rvs.uni-bielefeld.de/publications/Incidents/DOCS/ComAndRep/AeroPeru/aeroperu-news.html|title=Aeroperu B757 Accident|author=|date=|website=www.rvs.uni-bielefeld.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common to see [[key ring]]s, T-shirts, [[bag tag]]s, [[Belt (clothing)|belt]]s and other such products with this ribbon, especially for people who work in aviation or aviation enthusiasts.

A green tag is sometimes used to identify components that must be attached before flight in a similar way to remove before flight components.

It is based on the assumptions that surplus water in some rivers can be diverted to deficit rivers by creating a network of canals to interconnect the rivers.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:RiverLinkingMainMap.jpg|River linking map of India]] --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwda.gov.in/index2.asp?slid=3&amp;sublinkid=3&amp;langid=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons and motivations==
For an instance, in India the rainfall over the country is primarily orographic, associated with tropical depressions originating in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The summer monsoon accounts for more than 85 per cent of the precipitation. The uncertainty of occurrence of rainfall marked by prolonged dry spells and fluctuations in seasonal and annual rainfall is a serious problem for the country. Large parts of Haryana, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are not only in deficit in rainfall but also subject to large variations, resulting in frequent droughts and causing immense hardship to the population and enormous loss to the nation. The water availability even for drinking purposes becomes critical, particularly in the summer months as the rivers dry up and the ground water recedes. Regional variations in the rainfall lead to situations when some parts of the country do not have enough water even for raising a single crop. On the other hand, excess rainfall occurring in some parts of the country creates havoc due to floods.
 
Irrigation using river water and ground water has been the prime factor for raising the food grain production in India from a mere 50 million tonnes in the 1950s to more than 200 million tonnes at present, leading India to attain self-sufficiency in food. Irrigated area has increased from 22 million hectares to 95 million hectares during this period. The population of India, which is around 1000 million at present, is expected to increase to 1500 to 1800 million in the year 2050 and that would require about 450 million tonnes of food grains. For meeting this requirement, it would be necessary to increase irrigation potential to 160 million hectares for all crops by 2050. India's maximum irrigation potential that could be created through conventional sources has been assessed to be about 140 million hectares. For attaining a potential of 160 million hectares, other strategies shall have to be evolved.
 
Floods are a recurring feature, particularly by the Brahmaputra and Ganga rivers, in which almost 60 per cent of the river flows of India country occur. Flood damages, which were Rs. 52 crores in 1953, have gone up to Rs. 5,846 crores in 1998 with annual average being Rs. 1,343 crores affecting the States of Assam, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh along with untold human sufferings. On the other hand, large areas in the States of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu face recurring droughts. As much as 85 percentage of drought prone area falls in these States. One of the most effective ways to increase the irrigation potential for increasing the food grain production, mitigating floods and droughts and reducing regional imbalance in the availability of water is the Inter Basin Water Transfer (IBWT) from the surplus rivers to deficit areas. Brahmaputra and Ganga particularly their northern tributaries, Mahanadi, Godavari and West Flowing Rivers originating from the Western Ghats are found to be surplus in water resources. If we can build storage reservoirs on these rivers and connect them to other parts of the country, regional imbalances could be reduced significantly and lot of benefits could be gained by way of additional irrigation, domestic and industrial water supply, hydropower generation, navigational facilities etc.

== Benefits ==

===Irrigation===
By linking the rivers, vast amount of land areas which will not otherwise be [[Irrigation|irrigated]] and are unusable for [[agriculture]] become fertile.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;[http://www.the-south-asian.com/Aug2004/River-linking.htm Article at the-south-asian], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flood prevention===
During heavy [[rainy season]]s some areas can experience heavy [[flood]]s while other areas might be experiencing [[drought]] like situations. With network of rivers this problem can be greatly avoided by channeling excess water to areas that are not experiencing a flood or are dry.

===Generation of electricity===
With new canals built, feasibility of new [[Damages|dams]] to generate [[hydroelectric power]] becomes a possibility.

===Navigation===
Newly created network of canals opens up new routes and ways and routes of water navigation, which is generally more efficient and cheaper compared to [[road transport]].

==National River Linking Project in India==
{{main|Indian Rivers Inter-link}}
The National River Linking Project (NRLP) is designed to ease [[water shortage]]s in western and southern [[India]] while mitigating the impacts of recurrent floods in the eastern parts of the [[Ganga basin]]. The NRLP, if and when implemented, will be one of the biggest interbasin water transfer projects in the world.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

==Issues and Concerns==

=== Ecological issues ===

One of the major concerns is that rivers change their course in 70–100 years and thus once they are linked, future change of course could create huge practical problems for the project.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Aqua life===
A number of leading [[environmentalist]]s are of the opinion that the project could be an [[ecological disaster]]. There would be a decrease in downstream flows resulting in reduction of [[fresh water]] inflows into the seas seriously jeopardizing [[aquatic life]].&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

=== Deforestation ===
Creation of canals would need large areas of land resulting large scale [[deforestation]] in certain areas.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Areas getting submerged===
Possibility of new dams comes with the threat of large otherwise habitable or reserved land getting submerged under water or surface water.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Displacement of people===
As large strips of land might have to be converted to canals, a considerable population living in this areas must need to be rehabilitated to new areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6996">[[File:Saran Wrap 02.JPG|thumb| Polyvinylidene chloride wrap]]
'''Saran''' is a [[trade name]] currently owned by [[S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc.]] for a [[polyethylene]] food wrap.  The Saran trade name was once owned by [[Dow Chemical]] for [[polyvinylidene chloride]] (PVDC), along with other [[monomer]]s.  Since its accidental discovery in 1933, polyvinylidene chloride has been used for a number of commercial and industrial products.  

When formed into a thin plastic film, the principal advantages of polyvinylidene chloride, when compared to other plastics, are its ability to adhere to itself and its very low [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] to water vapor, flavor and aroma molecules, and oxygen. This oxygen barrier retards food spoilage, while the film barrier to flavor and aroma molecules helps food retain its flavor and aroma.

==History==
{{see also|Polyvinylidene chloride}}
Polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) was discovered at [[Dow Chemical Company]] (Michigan, USA) in 1933 when a lab worker, Ralph Wiley, was having trouble washing beakers used in his process of developing a dry-cleaning product.  It was initially developed into a spray that was used on US fighter planes and, later, automobile upholstery, to protect them from the elements.  Dow Chemical later named the product Saran and eliminated its green hue and offensive odor.

In 1942, fused layers of original-specification PVDC were used to make woven mesh ventilating insoles for newly developed [[jungle boot|jungle or tropical combat boots]] made of rubber and canvas.&lt;ref name="RIS"&gt;Risch, Erna, ''The Quartermaster Corps'', Washington, D.C.: Office of the Chief of Military History, Dept. of the Army (1953), pp. 108-109&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KEA"&gt;Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj), ''Jungle Snafus...And Remedies'', Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine (1996), pp. 179-183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="REP"&gt;''Report on Orinoco-Casiquiare-Negro Waterway: Venezuela-Colombia-Brazil, Volume 4, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Office of Inter-American Affairs (July 1943)&lt;/ref&gt;  These insoles were tested by experimental Army units in jungle exercises in Panama, Venezuela, and other countries, where they were found to increase the flow of dry outside air to the insole and base of the foot, reducing blisters and tropical ulcers.&lt;ref name="KEA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="REP"/&gt;  The PVDC ventilating mesh insole was later adopted by the United States Army for standard issue in its M-1945 and M-1966 Jungle Boots.&lt;ref name="RIS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KEA"/&gt;   In 1943, John Reilly (Ralph Wiley's boss)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=110&amp;dat=19940305&amp;id=pDRQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yFUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4910,5139514|title=Ludington Daily News - Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ralph Wiley of The Dow Chemical Co. completed the final work needed for introduction of PVDC, which had been invented in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brevets-patents.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/385753/summary.html|title=Canadian Patent Database / Base de données sur les brevets canadiens|first=Government of Canada, Industry Canada, Office of the Deputy Minister, Canadian Intellectual Property|last=Office|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PVDC monofilaments were also extruded for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6619/is_n5_v48/ai_n28613402/|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "Saran" was coined by a combination of John Reilly's wife's and daughter's names, Sarah and Ann Reilly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funtrivia.com/askft/Question14824.html|title=What is the origin of the brand names Saran Wrap and Oral B?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949, Dow introduced ''Saran Wrap'', a thin, clingy [[plastic wrap]] that was sold in rolls and used primarily for wrapping food.  It quickly became popular for preserving food items stored in the refrigerator.  ''Saran Wrap'' was later acquired by [[S. C. Johnson &amp; Son]].  However, today's ''Saran Wrap'' is no longer composed of PVDC in the United States, due to cost, [[Polyvinylidene_chloride#Disadvantages|processing difficulties]], and perceived environmental concerns with halogenated materials, and is now made from [[polyethylene]].&lt;ref name="SaranFAQ"&gt;[http://www.saranbrands.com/faq.asp#10 Saran Frequently Asked Questions], What ingredients are in Saran Plastic Wraps?&lt;/ref&gt; However, polyethylene has a higher oxygen permeability, which in turn affects food spoilage prevention.  For example, at 23&amp;nbsp;°C and 95% relative humidity polyvinylidene chloride has an oxygen permeability of 0.6&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; μm m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kPa&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; while [[low-density polyethylene]] under the same conditions has an oxygen permeability of 2000&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; μm m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kPa&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.e-fost.org/learnpath/index.php/lp/en/lp2_content/SCI-A-3-2-4 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726010302/http://www.e-fost.org/learnpath/index.php/lp/en/lp2_content/SCI-A-3-2-4 |archive-date=2011-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For that reason, packaging for the meat industry still may use PVDC containing films, as a barrier layer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ai407e/AI407E21.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the Vietnam War, the U.S. military phased out PVDC insoles in favor of Poron®, a microcellular urethane, for its jungle and combat boots.&lt;ref name="KEA"/&gt;  However, the British Army continues to use PVDC insoles in its combat boots, primarily because of its insulating properties.&lt;ref&gt;Westwood, E., Smith, N., and Dyson, R., ''Comparison of the Influence of Three Types of Military Boot Insoles Upon the Force and Loading Rates Experienced In Drop Jump Landings'', Biomechanics Symposia 2001, University of San Francisco (2001), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trademark status==
In some jurisdictions, the name Saran is a registered [[trademark]] of the [[Dow Chemical Company]], while in others,{{which|date=April 2015}} it has lost trademark status and become a [[genericized trademark|generic]] term for these polymers.  In Japan, Dow's trademark rights in Saran Wrap were assigned to [[Asahi Kasei]], which uses polyvinylidene chloride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What’s “Saran”? |publisher=Asahi Kasei Home Products Corporation |url=https://www.asahi-kasei.co.jp/sarannet/en/whatsaran.html |accessdate=May 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SEVSAT''' is an acronym for '''S'''hip '''E'''quip [[VSAT]], a maritime satellite broadband system from the Ship Equip Group with its head office in Norway. Ship Equip is a subsidiary of Inmarsat, a mobile satellite services operator.

== History ==
SEVSAT was developed from 2000–2003, and was initially based on [[space segment]] allocations from [[Eutelsat]] and [[Stratos Global Corporation|Stratos]] who had implemented the iDirect technology on some of their satellites. In 2004, Stratos closed down their maritime broadband division, and Ship Equip turned to the start-up space segment broker New Wave Broadband and satellite operator [[Intelsat]]. These two companies had independently decided to implement iDirect technology on the [[Intelsat 907|907 satellite]] that covered central and northern Europe, where customers of Ship Equip were primarily located.
 
From 2004–2006, while focusing primarily on its local markets in the offshore oil, gas and fisheries segments, the number of SEVSAT customers increased rapidly to over 100 installed systems early in 2006, and 200 systems by mid-2007.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The rate of growth during this period caught the attention of the media and in April 2006, the leading financial newspaper in Norway, ''[[Dagens Næringsliv]]'', ran an article indicating that Ship Equip was challenging [[Telenor]], which at that time was the market leader in maritime VSAT.&lt;ref&gt;"Preparing to compete Telenor at sea". ''Dagens Næringsliv'', 10 April 2006, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; (Shortly after, Telenor Satellite Services was purchased and merged with France Telecom Mobile Satellite Communications (FTMSC) under the [[Vizada]] brand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/media-telecommunications/telecommunications/5252234-1.html/ |title=Apax Partners Acquires Telenor Satellite Services and Integrates the Company into Vizada |date=6 September 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213060005/https://www.allbusiness.com/media-telecommunications/telecommunications/5252234-1.html |archivedate=13 February 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article initiated further press coverage from regional newspaper [[Sunnmørsposten]] and national newspaper [[Finansavisen]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 2009, the Comsys group's annual VSAT report quoted Ship Equip as having a 14.3% share in the maritime [[VSAT]] market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Comsys VSAT report, 10th edition |page=73 |url=http://www.comsys.co.uk:80/vsat_rep.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208190846/http://www.comsys.co.uk/vsat_rep.htm |archivedate=8 December 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Ship Equip was purchased by London-based [[Inmarsat]] for $159.5 million.&lt;ref name=deselding2011&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Selding|first1=Peter B.|title=Inmarsat Acquires Maritime VSAT Provider Ship Equip - SpaceNews.com|url=http://spacenews.com/inmarsat-acquires-maritime-vsat-provider-ship-equip/|website=SpaceNews.com|accessdate=7 July 2017|date=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Inmarsat, at the time of purchase, approximately 10% of vessels using Ku-band VSAT worldwide were using networks provided by Ship Equip.&lt;ref name=deselding2011 /&gt;

== Technology ==
SEVSAT includes above deck equipment (ADE) and below deck equipment (BDE). The ADE consists of the antenna which, except for some early deliveries, are SeaTel antennas. Two types of SEVSAT systems exist, [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] and [[Ku band|Ku-band]], denoting the frequency range in which they are capable of receiving a satellite signal. The C-band antennas are generally large, from {{convert|2.4|–|3.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} in dish diameter. The Ku-band antennas are smaller, from {{convert|1|–|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in dish diameter. The BDE most commonly consists of one electronic rack containing the following components: an iDirect [[modem]], the SEVSAT [[Satellite navigation|global satellite]] switching unit, a [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]], [[Cisco routers|Cisco Routers]], telephone adapters and a UPS{{Clarify|reason=What is UPS?|date=July 2017}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6105">[[File:SGDL0001.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|The lamp in the picture (taken in 2003) was still alight in the 1980s,  but was extinguished by the end of the 20th century.  It is situated at the corner of Stannington View Road and Mulehouse Road in [[Crookes]], [[Sheffield]], UK.]]
The main purpose of a '''sewer gas destructor lamp''' is to remove sewer gases and their hazards.

== Background ==
[[File:Sewer Gas Lamp, Rural Lane.jpg|upright|thumb|300px|Another Sheffield example on Rural Lane at [[Wadsley]].]]
[[Biogas]] forming in [[sanitary sewer|sewers]] via [[anaerobic digestion]] can be a potentially foul-smelling and explosive hazard (chiefly due to chemical spills).{{cn|date=February 2014}} Unlike ordinary [[gas lamps]] for street lighting,  the main purpose of sewer gas destructor lamps is to remove sewer gases and their hazards.  Joseph Edmund Webb of Birmingham patented a sewer gas destructor lamp.

Many of these lamps were installed in the UK in towns and cities including [[Sheffield]],  [[Winchester]], [[Durham, England|Durham]], [[Whitley Bay]], [[Monkseaton]] and [[Blyth, Northumberland]].&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;[http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/history/memories/3558291.Raising_a_stink/ Chris LLoyd, ''Northern Echo'' 30 July 2008] "Raising a Stink"&lt;/ref&gt;  With a flame generated by burning [[town gas]],  sewer gases were drawn from the sewer below and discharged above the heads of passers-by to dissipate odours.  The flame in the lamp does not actually generate sufficient thermal energy to combust any of the odour compounds in the air.{{dubious|date=February 2014}}

== Improvements ==
JE Webb addressed a number of problems of the lamps with further patents.  His patent GB189408193,&lt;ref&gt;Patent Number GB189408193;  Application Number 8193, ''25 April, 1894'';  Complete Specification Left ''24 January 1895'';  Accepted ''2 March, 1895''.  Joseph Edmund Webb of 223 New John Street West,  Hockley,  Birmingham,  Builder and Contractor&lt;/ref&gt;  approved 2-March-1895, stated: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It has also been found that when the gases are drawn out from the sewer by the burning of ordinary gas a sudden flushing of the sewer might prevent any sewer gas from escaping,  and thus momentarily cause the gas jets to be extinguished.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In order to solve this problem the patent specifies an arrangement of burners, air supply and heat reflection designed to produce an intense heat at the point of combustion. (Webb suggests {{convert|600|to|800|F|C}}).

== Sheffield ==
The lamps were installed at places where sewer gases were likely to collect,  such as at the tops of hills.  The city of [[Sheffield]],  being a hilly area,  had many sewer gas destructor lamps and many remain.

''Sheffield on the Net'' has a section on the old gas lamps, which states:  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Eighty-four of these street lamps were erected in Sheffield between 1914 and 1935, the largest number in any British town, due mainly to the many hills in the area where gas could be trapped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ukonline.co.uk/t.green/curiosities.htm Sheffield on the Net - City Curiosities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217235451/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/t.green/curiosities.htm |date=2007-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[Sheffield Star]]'' newspaper reported a local survey of the lamps by W Jessop.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, Sarah (2008), ''Wilf noses out locations of old gas lamps'', in The Diary, [[Sheffield Star]], 16/July/2008&lt;/ref&gt;  This survey found 25 remaining lamps in Sheffield. Twenty of these are grade II listed. In 2016 Sheffield residents campaigned for the lamps to be restored when the city council's replacement of every lamppost began, as part of the 25-year Streets Ahead road improvement programme. Sheffield Council plans to repaint the lamps and convert them to solar power with LED lights to replicate the original lighting. Sheffield's four gas-powered lamps will remain so after their restoration. It is planned that the lamps will be restored by December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-39409984|title=Sheffield's sewer gas lamps get new lease of life|date=2017-03-27|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== London ==
[[File:London lamp.jpg|thumb|upright|The only remaining lamp in London]]
Only one working sewer gas destructor lamp remains in London; however due to a traffic accident the original lamp was damaged and has been replaced with a replica. This lamp is currently in use and can be found burning day and night down the side street of the [[Savoy Hotel]] in London. The story of this lamp has given rise to locals referring to Carting Lane as 'Farting Lane'.&lt;ref name="historic-uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryMagazine/DestinationsUK/Farting-Lane/|title=Farting Lane|last=Johnson|first=Ben|date=n.d.|website=historic-uk.com|publisher=Historic UK|access-date=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shadyoldlady"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shadyoldlady.com/location.php?loc=925|title=Farting Lane's Sewer Lamp|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=n.d.|website=shadyoldlady.com|publisher=The Shady Old Lady|access-date=November 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current justification of the lamps ==
Although many of the existing lamps in Sheffield and elsewhere are now disused, the lamps still have a use today in reducing odours.  They do not prevent explosions as the concentration of methane in sewer gas is below the lower explosion limit (LEL) for methane.{{cn|date=February 2014}}  If the methane concentration were over the explosive limit (≈ 50,000 ppmv) the open flames in the lamps would burn like flares.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1708">{{Unreferenced|date=March 2009}}A '''signal tracer''' is a piece of [[electronic test equipment]] used to [[troubleshoot]] [[radio]] and other [[Electronics|electronic]] circuitry.

Usually a very simple device, it normally provides an [[amplifier]], and a [[loudspeaker]], often battery-powered and packaged into a small, hand-held [[test probe]]. An optional [[diode]] [[Detector (radio)|detector]] is usually also provided, allowing the detection of [[Amplitude modulation|amplitude-modulated]] signals.

The technician injects a test [[Signal (information theory)|signal]] into the [[device under test]]. Then, by using the signal tracer, the tech can follow the signal through the various circuits of the radio receiver. So long as the signal can be heard, the circuitry up to that point is (at least minimally) functional. If the signal disappears, however, a [[Fault (technology)|fault]] can be assumed to be present in the stage of the circuit just passed.

The diode detector is only sensitive to amplitude modulation but even circuits that are normally used for other modulation schemes (such as [[Frequency modulation|FM]] radios) can be tested by using an AM test signal for testing the [[radio frequency]] circuits, then switching to an FM test signal (and switching out the diode detector) for testing the audio circuits of the radio.

More sophisticated signal tracers may display [[Digital electronics|digital]] levels using, for example, [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]]. For long pulse trains, a [[cyclic redundancy check]] may be calculated and displayed, giving the tech insight into the content of circuits that are switching rapidly.

'''MAES: Latinos in Science and Engineering, Inc.''' (MAES), originally the ''Mexican American Engineering Society'' was founded in 1974. It organizes an annual symposium and [[Job fair|career fair]].

== History ==

MAES was founded in [[Los Angeles]] in 1974 to increase the number of [[Mexican Americans]] and other Hispanics in the technical and scientific fields.

The idea to establish a professional society for Mexican American engineers originated with Robert Von Hatten, an aerospace electronics engineer with TRW Defense Space Systems in [[Redondo Beach, California]].  Mr. Von Hatten had for several years served as volunteer for programs directed at combating the alarming number of [[high school dropouts]].  He envisioned a national organization that would serve as a source for role models, address the needs of its members, and become a resource for industry and students.

In mid–1974, Mr. Von Hatten contacted Manuel Castro to join him in the campaign to form the professional organization.  During a subsequent series of meetings, a cohort of individuals banded together to lay out the foundation for the “Mexican American Engineering Society.”   The founders, listed below, drafted the articles of incorporation and the first bylaws of the society.

Oscar Buttner – Rockwell International'''
Sam Buttner – Southern California Edison''
Manuel Castro – Bechtel Power
Clifford Maldonado – Northrop Corporation
Sam Mendoza – California State University, Fullerton
Frank Serna – Northrop Corporation
Robert Von Hatten – TRW Defense Space Systems

The society filed incorporation papers as a [[nonprofit]], tax exempt organization with the California Secretary of State in October 1974, and it received its charter on March 28, 1975.  The [[Internal Revenue Service]] granted the society a federal tax–exemption letter and employer identification number on January 4, 1979.  Ten years later, to reflect its broader technical membership, the organization filed to change its name to the “Society of Mexican American Engineers and Scientists, Inc.”.  This change was granted on July 19, 1989.

MAES is one of several membership–based organizations that represent Latinos in engineering and science.  As a mature organization with over 30 years of experience addressing the concerns of Latinos, MAES is a source of expertise on barriers to and methods for improving educational access and attainment.  The society recognizes the importance of encouraging more youth to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics as a means for economic advancement and workforce development.

Many of its programs, with the financial help of members, companies, and government agencies are directed at increasing the number of students at all grade levels who will study, prepare, enter, and excel in the technical professions.

This SoC does not contain any kind of data storage, which is common for a microprocessor SoC.]]

A '''system on a chip''' or '''system on chip''' ('''{{Abbr|SoC|System on Chip}},''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|s|ˌ|oʊ|ˈ|s|iː|}} {{respell|es|oh|SEE}} or {{IPAc-en|s|ɒ|k}} {{respell|sock}})&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;This article uses the convention that SoC is pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|s|ˌ|oʊ|ˈ|s|iː|}} {{respell|es|oh|SEE}}. Therefore, it uses the convention "an" for the [[indefinite article]] corresponding to SoC ("'''an''' SoC"). Other sources may pronounce it as {{IPAc-en|s|ɒ|k}} {{respell|sock}} and therefore use "'''a''' SoC".&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[integrated circuit]] (also known as a "chip") that integrates all components of a [[computer]] or other [[Electronics|electronic system]].  These components typically include a [[central processing unit]] (CPU), [[Computer memory|memory]], [[input/output]] ports and [[Computer data storage#Secondary storage|secondary storage]] &amp;ndash; all on a single [[substrate (electronics)|substrate]].  It may contain [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital]], [[Analog signal|analog]], [[Mixed-signal integrated circuit|mixed-signal]], and often [[radio frequency]] [[signal processing]] functions, depending on the application.  As they are integrated on a single [[Substrate (electronics)|electronic substrate]], SoCs consume much less power and take up much less area than multi-chip designs with equivalent functionality.  Because of this, SoCs are very common in the [[mobile computing]] and [[edge computing]] markets.&lt;ref&gt;Pete Bennett, [[EE Times]]. "[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1276973 The why, where and what of low-power SoC design]." December 2, 2004. Retrieved July 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.design-reuse.com/articles/42705/power-management-for-iot-soc-development.html|title=Power Management for Internet of Things (IoT) System on a Chip (SoC) Development|last=Nolan|first=Stephen M.|date=|website=Design And Reuse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Systems on chip are commonly used in [[Embedded system|embedded systems]] and the [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]].

Systems on Chip are in contrast to the common traditional [[motherboard]]-based [[Personal computer|PC]] [[Computer architecture|architecture]], which separates components based on function and connects them through a central interfacing circuit board.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;This central board is called the "mother board" for hosting the "child" component cards.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas a motherboard houses and connects detachable or replaceable components, SoCs integrate all of these components into a single integrated circuit, as if all these functions were built into the motherboard.  An SoC will typically integrate a CPU, graphics and memory interfaces,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The graphics connections ([[PCI Express]]) and RAM historically constituted the [[northbridge (computing)|northbridge]] of motherboard-backed discrete architectures.&lt;/ref&gt; hard-disk and USB connectivity,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The hard disk and USB connectivity historically comprised part of the [[southbridge (computing)|southbridge]] of motherboard-backed discrete modular architectures.&lt;/ref&gt; [[random-access memory|random-access]] and [[read-only memory|read-only]] [[computer memory|memories]] and secondary storage on a single circuit die, whereas a motherboard would connect these modules as [[discrete components]] or [[expansion card]]s.

More tightly integrated computer system designs improve [[computer performance|performance]] and reduce [[power consumption]] as well as [[Die (integrated circuit)|semiconductor die]] area needed for an equivalent design composed of discrete modules, at the cost of reduced [[Interchangeable parts|replaceability]] of components.  By definition, SoC designs are fully or nearly fully integrated across different component [[Modularity|modules]].  For these reasons, there has been a general trend towards tighter integration of components in the [[Semiconductor industry|computer hardware industry]], in part due to the influence of SoCs and lessons learned from the mobile and embedded computing markets.  Systems-on-Chip can be viewed as part of a larger trend towards [[embedded system|embedded computing]] and [[hardware acceleration]].

An SoC integrates a [[microcontroller]] or [[microprocessor]] with advanced peripherals like [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU), [[Wi-Fi]] module, or one or more [[coprocessor|coprocessors]].  Similar to how a microcontroller integrates a microprocessor with peripheral circuits and memory, an SoC can be seen as integrating a microcontroller with even more advanced [[Peripheral|peripherals]].  {{Selfref inline|For an overview of integrating system components, see [[system integration]].}}

== Types ==
[[Image:ARMSoCBlockDiagram.svg|right|275px|thumbnail|[[Microcontroller]]-based system on a chip]]In general, there are four distinguishable types of SoCs: 

* SoCs built around a [[microcontroller]] (μC),
* SoCs built around a [[microprocessor]] (μP), often found in mobile phones;
* Specialized SoCs [[Application-specific integrated circuit|designed for specific applications]] that do not fit into the above two categories, and
* [[Programmable system-on-chip|Programmable systems-on-chip]] (PSoC), where most functionality is fixed but some functionality is [[reconfigurable computing|reprogrammable]] in a manner analogous to a [[field-programmable gate array]].

[[File:KL AMD Am286LX ZX.jpg|thumb|[[AMD]] Am286ZX/LX, SoC based on [[Intel 80286]] ]]

== Applications ==
Systems-on-chip can be applied to any computing task.  However, they are typically used in mobile computing such as tablets, smartphones, smartwatches and netbooks as well as [[Embedded system|embedded systems]] and in applications where previously [[Microcontroller|microcontrollers]] would be used. 

=== Embedded systems ===
Where previously only microcontrollers could be used, SoCs are rising to prominence in the embedded systems market.  Tighter system integration offers better reliability and [[Mean time between failures|mean time between failure]], and SoCs offer more advanced functionality and computing power than microcontrollers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.embedded.com/design/mcus-processors-and-socs/4419584/Is-a-single-chip-SOC-processor-right-for-your-embedded-project-|title=Is a single-chip SOC processor right for your embedded project?|work=Embedded|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Applications include [[AI accelerator|AI acceleration]], embedded [[machine vision]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imveurope.com/news/qualcomm-launches-socs-embedded-vision|title=Qualcomm launches SoCs for embedded vision {{!}} Imaging and Machine Vision Europe|website=www.imveurope.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; data collection, [[telemetry]], vector processing and [[ambient intelligence]].  Often embedded systems-on-chip target the [[internet of things]], [[Internet of things|industrial internet of things]] and [[edge computing]] markets.

=== Mobile computing ===
[[Mobile computing]] based SoCs  typically bundle processors, memories, on-chip [[Cache (computing)|caches]], [[wireless networking]] capabilities and often [[digital camera]] hardware and firmware. Some mobile computing SoCs include:

*[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]: [[Apple-designed processors]]
**[[Apple A12|A12 Bionic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/12/apple-a12-bionic-7-nanometer-chip/|title=Apple's A12 Bionic is the first 7-nanometer smartphone chip|work=Engadget|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[Apple A series|A series]], used in [[IPhone|iPhones]] and [[IPad|iPads]]

== Structure ==
An SoC consists of hardware [[Functional unit|functional units]], including [[Microprocessor|microprocessors]] that run [[Computer program|software code]], as well as a [[communications subsystem]] to connect, control, direct and interface between these functional modules.

=== Functional components ===
==== Processor cores ====
An SoC must have at least one [[processor core]], but will typically have more.  Processor cores can be a [[microcontroller]], [[microprocessor]] (μP),&lt;ref name="Furber ARM"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44267964|title=ARM system-on-chip architecture|last=Furber|first=Stephen B.|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=2000|isbn=0201675196|location=Harlow, England|pages=|oclc=44267964}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[digital signal processor]] (DSP) or [[application-specific instruction set processor]] (ASIP) core.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/869378184|title=Pipelined Multiprocessor System-on-Chip for Multimedia|publisher=[[Springer-Verlag|Springer]]|others=|year=2014|isbn=9783319011134|location=|pages=|oclc=869378184|authors=Haris Javaid, Sri Parameswaran}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ASIPs have [[Instruction set architecture|instruction sets]] that are customized for an [[application domain]] and designed to be more efficient than general-purpose instructions for a specific type of workload. [[Multi-processor system-on-chip|Multiprocessor SoCs]] have more than one processor core by definition. 

Whether single-core, [[Multi-core processor|multi-core]] or [[manycore]], SoC processor cores typically use [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] instruction set architectures.  RISC architectures are advantageous over [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] processors for systems-on-chip because they require less digital logic, and therefore less power and area on [[Die (integrated circuit)|board]], and in the [[Embedded system|embedded]] and [[Mobile computing|mobile]] computing markets these are often highly constrained.  In particular, SoC processor cores often use the [[ARM architecture]] because it is a [[Soft microprocessor|soft processor]] specified as an [[IP core]] and more power efficient than [[x86]].&lt;ref name="Furber ARM" /&gt;

==== Memories ====
{{Further|Computer memory}}
Systems-on-chip must have [[semiconductor memory]] blocks to perform their computation, as do [[Microcontroller|microcontrollers]] and other [[Embedded system|embedded systems]].  Depending on the application, SoC memory may form a [[memory hierarchy]] and [[cache hierarchy]].  In the mobile computing market, this is common, but in many [[Low-power electronics|low-power]] embedded microcontrollers this is not necessary.

Memory technologies for SoCs include [[read-only memory]] (ROM), [[random-access memory]] (RAM), electrically erasable programmable ROM ([[EEPROM]]) and [[flash memory]].&lt;ref name="Furber ARM" /&gt;  As in other computer systems, RAM can be subdivided into relatively faster but more expensive [[Static random-access memory|static RAM]] (SRAM) and the slower but cheaper [[Dynamic random-access memory|dynamic RAM]] (DRAM).  When a SoC has a [[Cache (computing)|cache]] hierarchy, SRAM will usually be used to implement [[Processor register|processor registers]] and cores' [[L1 cache|L1 caches]] whereas DRAM will be used for lower levels of the cache hierarchy including [[main memory]].  "Main memory" may be specific to a single processor (which can be [[Multi-core processor|multi-core]]) when the SoC [[Multi-processor system-on-chip|has multiple processors]], in which case it is [[distributed memory]] and must be sent via {{Section link||Intermodule communication|nopage=y}} on-chip to be accessed by a different processor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For further discussion of multi-processing memory issues, see [[cache coherence]] and [[memory latency]].

==== Interfaces ====
SoCs include external [[Electrical connector|interfaces]], typically for [[Communication protocol|communication protocols]]. These are often based upon industry standards such as [[USB]], [[FireWire]], [[Ethernet]], [[Universal synchronous and asynchronous receiver-transmitter|USART]], [[Serial Peripheral Interface|SPI]], [[HDMI]], [[I²C]], etc. These interfaces will differ according to the intended application.  [[Wireless network|Wireless networking]] protocols such as [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], [[6LoWPAN]] and [[near-field communication]] may also be supported.

When needed, SoCs include [[Analog signal|analog]] interfaces including [[Analog-to-digital converter|analog-to-digital]] and [[Digital-to-analog converter|digital-to-analog converters]], often for [[signal processing]].  These may be able to interface with different types of [[Sensor|sensors]] or [[Actuator|actuators]], including [[Smart transducer|smart transducers]].  They may interface with application-specific [[Modularity|modules]] or shields.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;In [[Embedded system|embedded systems]], "shields" are analogous to [[Expansion card|expansion cards]] for [[Personal computer|PCs]]. They often fit over a [[microcontroller]] such as an [[Arduino]] or [[single-board computer]] such as the [[Raspberry Pi]] and function as [[Peripheral|peripherals]] for the device.&lt;/ref&gt;  Or they may be internal to the SoC, such as if an analog sensor is built in to the SoC and its readings must be converted to digital signals for mathematical processing.

==== Digital signal processors ====
[[Digital signal processor]] (DSP) cores are often included on systems-on-chip.  They perform [[signal processing]] operations in systems-on-chip for [[Sensor|sensors]], [[Actuator|actuators]], [[data collection]], [[data analysis]] and multimedia processing. DSP cores typically feature [[very long instruction word]] (VLIW) and [[SIMD|single instruction, multiple data]] (SIMD) [[Instruction set architecture|instruction set architectures]], and are therefore highly amenable to exploiting [[instruction-level parallelism]] through [[Parallel processing (DSP implementation)|parallel processing]] and [[superscalar execution]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|4}}  DSP cores most often feature application-specific instructions, and as such are typically [[Application-specific instruction-set processor|application-specific instruction-set processors]] (ASIP).  Such application-specific instructions correspond to dedicated hardware [[Functional unit|functional units]] that compute those instructions.

Typical DSP instructions include [[Multiply–accumulate operation|multiply-accumulate]], [[Fast Fourier transform]], [[Fused multiply-accumulate|fused multiply-add]], and [[Convolution|convolutions]].

==== Other ====
As with other computer systems, SoCs require [[Clock generator|timing sources]] to generate [[clock signal|clock signals]], control execution of SoC functions and provide time context to [[signal processing]] applications of the SoC, if needed.  Popular time sources are [[crystal oscillators]] and [[phase-locked loop]]s. 

System-on-chip [[Peripheral|peripherals]] including [[counter (digital)|counter]]-timers, real-time [[timer]]s and [[power-on reset]] generators. SoCs also include [[voltage regulator]]s and [[power management]] circuits.

=== Intermodule communication ===
Systems-on-chip comprise many [[Execution unit|execution units]].  These units must often send [[data]] and [[Instruction (computing)|instructions]] back and forth.  Because of this, all but the most trivial SoCs require [[Communications system|communications subsystems]].  Originally, as with other [[microcomputer]] technologies, [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] architectures were used, but recently designs based on sparse intercommunication networks known as [[Network on a chip|networks-on-chip]] (NoC) have risen to prominence and are forecast to overtake bus architectures for SoC design in the near future.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/895661009|title=Network-on-chip: the Next Generation of System-on-Chip Integration|last=Kundu|first=Santanu|last2=Chattopadhyay|first2=Santanu|publisher=CRC Press|others=|year=2014|isbn=9781466565272|edition=1st|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=|oclc=895661009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bus-based communication ====
Historically, a shared global [[bus (computing)|computer bus]] typically connected the different components, also called "blocks" of the System-on-Chip.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A very common bus for system-on-chip communications is ARM's royalty-free Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture ([[Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture|AMBA]]) standard. 

[[Direct memory access]] controllers route data directly between external interfaces and SoC memory, bypassing the CPU or [[control unit]], thereby increasing the data [[throughput]] of the system-on-chip.  This is similar to some [[device driver]]s of peripherals on component-based [[multi-chip module]] PC architectures. 

Computer buses are limited in [[scalability]], supporting only up to tens of cores ([[multicore]]) on a single chip.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|xiii}}  Wire delay is not scalable due to continued [[miniaturization]], [[Computer performance|system performance]] does not scale with the number of cores attached, the SoC's [[operating frequency]] must decrease with each additional core attached for power to be sustainable, and long wires consume large amounts of electrical power. These challenges are prohibitive to supporting [[manycore]] systems on chip.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|xiii}}

==== Network-on-Chip ====
{{Main|Network on a chip}}
In the late [[2010s]], a trend of systems-on-chip implementing [[Communications subsystem|communications subsystems]] in terms of a network-like topology instead of [[bus (computing)|bus-based]] protocols has emerged.  A trend towards [[Multi-processor system-on-chip|more processor cores on SoCs]] has caused on-chip communication efficiency to become one of the key factors in determining the overall system performance and cost.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|xiii}}  This has led to the emergence of interconnection networks with [[Router (computing)|router]]-based [[packet switching]] known as "[[network on a chip|networks on chip]]" (NoCs) to overcome the [[Bottleneck (engineering)|bottlenecks]] of bus-based networks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|xiii}} 

Networks-on-chip have advantages including destination- and application-specific [[routing]], greater power efficiency and reduced possibility of [[bus contention]].  Network-on-chip architectures take inspiration from [[Networking protocol|networking protocols]] like [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and the [[Internet protocol suite]] for on-chip communication,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; although they typically have fewer [[Network layer|network layers]].  Optimal network-on-chip [[Network architecture|network architectures]] are an ongoing area of much research interest.  NoC architectures range from traditional distributed computing [[Network topology|network topologies]] such as [[Torus interconnect|torus]], [[Hypercube internetwork topology|hypercube]], [[Mesh networking|meshes]] and [[Tree network|tree networks]] to [[genetic algorithm scheduling]] to [[Randomized algorithm|randomized algorithms]] such as [[Branching random walk|random walks with branching]] and randomized [[time to live]] (TTL).

Many SoC researchers consider NoC architectures to be the future of system-on-chip design because they have been shown to efficiently meet power and throughput needs of SoC designs.  Current NoC architectures are two-dimensional.  2D IC design has limited [[Floorplan (microelectronics)|floorplanning]] choices as the number of cores in SoCs increase, so as [[Three-dimensional integrated circuit|three-dimensional integrated circuits]] (3DICs) emerge, SoC designers look to build three-dimensional on-chip networks known as 3DNoCs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{Main|Design flow (EDA)|Physical design (electronics)|Platform-based design|l1=Electronics design flow|l3=}}{{See also|Systems design|Software design|label 2=Software design process}}[[Image:SoCDesignFlow.svg|right|275px|thumbnail|System-on-a-chip design flow]]

A system on chip consists of both the [[electronic hardware|hardware]], described in {{Section link||Structure|nopage=y}}, and the [[software]] controlling the microcontroller, microprocessor or digital signal processor cores, peripherals and interfaces.  The [[design flow (EDA)|design flow]] for an SoC aims to develop this hardware and software at the same time, also known as architectural co-design.  The design flow must also take into account optimizations ({{Section link||Optimization goals|nopage=y}}) and constraints.

Most SoCs are developed from pre-qualified hardware component [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|IP core specifications]] for the hardware elements and [[execution unit]]s, collectively "blocks", described above, together with software [[device driver]]s that may control their operation.  Of particular importance are the [[protocol stack]]s that drive industry-standard interfaces like [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]].  The hardware blocks are put together using [[computer-aided design]] tools, specifically [[electronic design automation]] tools; the [[modular programming|software modules]] are integrated using a software [[integrated development environment]].

Systems-on-chip components are also often designed in [[High-level programming language|high-level programming languages]] such as [[C++]], [[MATLAB]] or [[SystemC]] and converted to [[Register-transfer level|RTL]] designs through [[high-level synthesis]] (HLS) tools such as [[C to HDL]] or [[flow to HDL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eejournal.com/archives/articles/20110825-mathworks/|title=Best Practices for FPGA Prototyping of MATLAB and Simulink Algorithms|date=2011-08-25|work=EEJournal|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  HLS products called "algorithmic synthesis" allow designers to use C++ to model and synthesize system, circuit, software and verification levels all in one high level language commonly known to [[computer engineers]] in a manner independent of time scales, which are typically specified in HDL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1271261|title=The 'why' and 'what' of algorithmic synthesis|last=Bowyer|first=Bryan|date=2005-02-05|website=[[EE Times]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other components can remain software and be compiled and embedded onto [[Soft microprocessor|soft-core processors]] included in the SoC as modules in HDL as [[Semiconductor intellectual property core|IP cores]].

Once the [[Computer architecture|architecture]] of the SoC has been defined, any new hardware elements are written in an abstract [[hardware description language]] termed [[Register-transfer level|register transfer level]] (RTL) which defines the circuit behavior, or synthesized into RTL from a high level language through high-level synthesis.  These elements are connected together in a hardware description language to create the full SoC design.  The logic specified to connect these components and convert between possibly different interfaces provided by different vendors is called [[glue logic]].

=== Design verification ===
{{Further|Functional verification|Signoff (electronic design automation)||label2=}}
Chips are verified for logical correctness before being sent to a [[Semiconductor fabrication plant|semiconductor foundry]].  This process is called [[functional verification]] and it accounts for a significant portion of the time and energy expended in the [[Integrated circuit development|chip design life cycle]], often quoted as 70%.&lt;ref name="70% verification?"&gt;[[EE Times]]. "[http://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&amp;doc_id=1264922 Is verification really 70 percent?]." June 14, 2004. Retrieved July 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="verification vs. validation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softwaretestingclass.com/difference-between-verification-and-validation/|title=Difference between Verification and Validation|work=Software Testing Class|access-date=2018-04-30|quote=In interviews most of the interviewers are asking questions on  “What is Difference between Verification and Validation?” Lots of people use verification and validation interchangeably but both have different meanings.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the growing complexity of chips, [[hardware verification language]]s like [[SystemVerilog]], [[SystemC]], [[e (verification language)|e]], and [[OpenVera]] are being used.  [[Software bug|Bugs]] found in the verification stage are reported to the designer.

Traditionally, engineers have employed simulation acceleration, [[emulator|emulation]] or prototyping on [[Reconfigurable computing|reprogrammable hardware]] to verify and debug hardware and software for SoC designs prior to the finalization of the design, known as [[tape-out]].  [[Field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGAs) are favored for prototyping systems-on-chip because [[FPGA prototyping|FPGA prototypes]] are reprogrammable, allow [[debugging]] and are more flexible than [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s (ASICs).&lt;ref name="nm prototyping"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tayden.com/publications/Nanometer%20Prototyping.pdf|title=Nanometer prototyping|last=Rittman|first=Danny|date=2006-01-05|website=Tayden Design|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reason to debug in FPGA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.design-reuse.com/articles/13550/fpga-prototyping-to-structured-asic-production-to-reduce-cost-risk-ttm.html|title=FPGA Prototyping to Structured ASIC Production to Reduce Cost, Risk &amp; TTM|website=Design And Reuse|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With high capacity and fast compilation time, simulation acceleration and emulation are powerful technologies that provide wide visibility into systems.  Both technologies, however, operate slowly, on the order of MHz, which may be significantly slower – up to 100 times slower – than the SoC's operating frequency.  Acceleration and emulation boxes are also very large and expensive at over US$1 million.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} 

FPGA prototypes, in contrast, use FPGAs directly to enable engineers to validate and test at, or close to, a system’s full operating frequency with real-world stimuli.  Tools such as Certus&lt;ref&gt;Brian Bailey, EE Times. "[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1317504 Tektronix hopes to shake up ASIC prototyping]." October 30, 2012. Retrieved July 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; are used to insert probes in the FPGA RTL that make signals available for observation.  This is used to debug hardware, firmware and software interactions across multiple FPGAs with capabilities similar to a logic analyzer.

In parallel, the hardware elements are grouped and passed through a process of [[logic synthesis]], during which performance constraints, such as operational frequency and expected signal delays, are applied.  This generates an output known as a [[netlist]] describing the design as a physical circuit and its interconnections.  These netlists are combined with the [[glue logic]] connecting the components to produce the schematic description of the SoC as a circuit which can be [[printed circuit board|printed]] onto a chip.  This process is known as [[place and route]] and precedes [[tape-out]] in the event that the SoCs are produced as [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s (ASIC).

== Optimization goals ==
Systems-on-chip must optimize [[Power consumption|power use]], area on [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]], communication, positioning for [[Locality of reference|locality]] between modular units and other factors.  Optimization is necessarily a design goal of systems-on-chip.  If optimization was not necessary, the engineers would use a [[multi-chip module]] architecture without accounting for the area utilization, power consumption or performance of the system to the same extent.  

Common optimization targets for system-on-chip designs follow, with explanations of each.  In general, optimizing any of these quantities may be a hard [[combinatorial optimization]] problem, and can indeed be [[NP-hardness|NP-hard]] fairly easily.  Therefore, sophisticated [[Optimization algorithm|optimization algorithms]] are often required and it may be practical to use [[Approximation algorithm|approximation algorithms]] or [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]] in some cases.  Additionally, most SoC designs contain [[Multivariate optimization|multiple variables to optimize simultaneously]], so [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficient]] solutions are sought after in SoC design.  Oftentimes the goals of optimizing some of these quantities are directly at odds, further adding complexity to design optimization of systems-on-chip and introducing [[Trade-off#Engineering|trade-offs]] in system design.

For broader coverage of trade-offs and [[requirements analysis]], see [[requirements engineering]].

=== Targets ===

==== Power consumption ====
Systems-on-chip are optimized to minimize the [[Electric power#Definition|electrical power]] used to perform the SoC's functions.  Most SoCs must use low power.  SoC systems often require long [[battery life]] (such as [[smartphone]]s), can potentially spending months or years without a power source needing to maintain autonomous function, and often are limited in power use by a high number of [[Embedded system|embedded]] SoCs being [[Distributed computing|networked together]] in an area.  Additionally, energy costs can be high and conserving energy will reduce the [[total cost of ownership]] of the SoC.  Finally, [[waste heat]] from high energy consumption can damage other circuit components if too much heat is dissipated, giving another pragmatic reason to conserve energy.  The amount of [[energy]] used in a circuit is the [[integral]] of [[Power (physics)|power]] consumed with respect to time, and the [[Mean value theorem|average rate]] of power consumption is the product of [[Electric current|current]] by [[voltage]].  Equivalently, by [[Ohm's law]], power is current squared times resistance or voltage squared divided by [[Resistance (physics)|resistance]]: 

&lt;math display="block"&gt;P = IV = \frac{V^2}{R} = {I^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;Systems-on-chip are frequently embedded in [[Mobile device|portable devices]] such as [[smartphones]], [[GPS navigation device|GPS navigation devices]], digital [[Digital watch|watches]] (including [[Smartwatch|smartwatches]]) and [[Netbook|netbooks]].  Customers want long battery lives for [[mobile computing]] devices, another reason that power consumption must be minimized in systems-on-chip.  [[Multimedia application|Multimedia applications]] are often executed on these devices, including [[Video game|video games]], [[video streaming]], [[image processing]]; all of which have grown in [[computational complexity]] in recent years with user demands and expectations for higher-[[Video quality|quality]] multimedia.  Computation is more demanding as expectations move towards [[3D video]] at [[high resolution]] with [[List of video compression formats|multiple standards]], so SoCs performing multimedia tasks must be computationally capable platform while being low power to run off a standard mobile battery.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|3}}

==== Performance per watt ====
{{See also|Green computing}}
SoCs are optimized to maximize [[power efficiency]] in performance per watt: maximize the performance of the SoC given a budget of power usage.  Many applications such as [[edge computing]], [[distributed processing]] and [[ambient intelligence]] require a certain level of [[Computer performance|computational performance]], but power is limited in most SoC environments.  The [[ARM architecture]] has greater performance per watt than [[x86]] in embedded systems, so it is preferred over x86 for most SoC applications requiring an [[Soft microprocessor|embedded processor]].

==== Waste heat ====
{{Main|Heat generation in integrated circuits}}{{See also|Thermal management (electronics)|Thermal design power|label 1=Thermal management in electronics}}
SoC designs are optimized to minimize [[waste heat]] [[dissipation|output]] on the chip.  As with other [[Integrated circuit|integrated circuits]], heat generated due to high [[power density]] are the [[Bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]] to further [[miniaturization]] of components.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/934678500|title=Heat Management in Integrated circuits: On-chip and system-level monitoring and cooling|last=Ogrenci-Memik|first=Seda|publisher=The Institution of Engineering and Technology|year=2015|isbn=9781849199353|location=London, United Kingdom|pages=|oclc=934678500}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|1}}  The power densities of high speed integrated circuits, particularly microprocessors and including SoCs, have become highly uneven.  Too much waste heat can damage circuits and erode [[Reliability (semiconductor)|reliability]] of the circuit over time.  High temperatures and thermal stress negatively impact [[wikt:reliability|reliability]], [[stress migration]], decreased [[mean time between failures]], [[electromigration]], [[wire bonding]], [[Metastability (electronics)|metastability]] and other performance degradation of the SoC over time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|2-9}}

In particular, most SoCs are in a small physical area or volume and therefore the effects of waste heat are compounded because there is little room for it to diffuse out of the system.  Because of high [[Transistor count|transistor counts]] on modern devices due to [[Moore's law]], oftentimes a layout of sufficient throughput and high [[Transistors density|transistor density]] is physically realizable from [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabrication processes]] but would result in unacceptably high amounts of heat in the circuit's volume.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|1}} 

These thermal effects force SoC and other chip designers to apply conservative [[Design margin|design margins]], creating less performant devices to mitigate the risk of [[catastrophic failure]].  Due to increased [[Transistors density|transistor densities]] as length scales get smaller, each [[Semiconductor node|process generation]] produces more heat output than the last.  Compounding this problem, system-on-chip architectures are usually heterogeneous, creating spatially inhomogeneous [[Heat flux|heat fluxes]], which are cannot be effectively mitigated by uniform [[passive cooling]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|1}}

==== Throughput ====
{{Expand section|date=October 2018}}
SoCs are optimized to maximize computational and communications [[throughput]].

==== Latency ====
{{Expand section|date=October 2018}}
SoCs are optimized to minimize [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] for some or all of their functions.  This can be accomplished by [[Integrated circuit layout|laying out]] elements with proper proximity and [[Locality of reference|locality]] to each-other to minimize the interconnection delays and maximize the speed at which data is communicated between modules, [[Execution unit|functional units]] and memories.  In general, optimizing to minimize latency is an [[NP-completeness|NP-complete]] problem equivalent to the [[boolean satisfiability problem]].

For [[Task (computing)|tasks]] running on processor cores, latency and throughput can be improved with {{Section link||Task scheduling|nopage=y}}.  Some tasks run in application-specific hardware units, however, and even task scheduling may not be sufficient to optimize all software-based tasks to meet timing and throughput constraints.

=== Methodologies ===
{{Further|Multi-objective optimization|Multiple-criteria decision analysis|Architecture tradeoff analysis method|label3=Architecture tradeoff analysis}}
{{Expand section|date=October 2018|small=no}}
Systems on chip are modeled with standard hardware [[verification and validation]] techniques, but additional techniques are used to model and optimize SoC design alternatives to make the system optimal with respect to [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]] on the above optimization targets.

==== Task scheduling ====
[[Scheduling (computing)|Task scheduling]] is an important activity in any computer system with multiple [[Process (computing)|processes]] or [[Thread (computing)|threads]] sharing a single processor core.  It is important to reduce {{Section link||Latency|nopage=y}} and increase {{Section link||Throughput|nopage=y}} for [[embedded software]] running on an SoC's {{Section link||Processor cores|nopage=y}}.  Not every important computing activity in a system-on-chip is performed in software running on on-chip processors, but scheduling can drastically improve performance of software-based tasks and other tasks involving [[Shared resource|shared resources]].

SoCs often schedule tasks according to [[network scheduling]] and [[Stochastic scheduling|randomized scheduling]] algorithms.

==== Pipelining ====
{{Broader|Pipeline (computing)}}
Hardware and software tasks are often pipelined in [[processor design]].  Pipelining is an important principle for [[speedup]] in [[computer architecture]].  They are frequently used in [[GPU|GPUs]] ([[graphics pipeline]]) and RISC processors (evolutions of the [[classic RISC pipeline]]), but are also applied to application-specific tasks such as [[digital signal processing]] and multimedia manipulations in the context of systems-on-chip.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Probabilistic modeling ====
Systems-on-chip are often analyzed though [[Probabilistic model|probabilistic models]], {{Section link|Queueing theory|Queueing networks}} and [[Markov chain|Markov chains]].  For instance, [[Little's law]] allows SoC states and NoC buffers to be modeled as arrival processes and analyzed through [[Poisson random variable|Poisson random variables]] and [[Poisson process|Poisson processes]].

==== Markov chains ====
SoCs are often modeled with [[Markov chain|Markov chains]], both [[Markov chain#Discrete-time%20Markov%20chain|discrete time]] and [[Markov chain#Continuous-time Markov chain|continuous time]] variants.  Markov chain modeling allows [[asymptotic analysis]] of the system-on-chip's [[Markov chain#Steady-state analysis and limiting distributions|steady state distribution]] of power, heat, latency and other factors to allow design decisions to be optimized for the common case.

== Fabrication ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}{{See|Semiconductor device fabrication}}

The netlists described above are used as the basis for the physical design ([[place and route]]) flow to convert the designers' intent into the design of the SoC.  Throughout this conversion process, the design is analyzed with static timing modeling, simulation and other tools to ensure that it meets the specified operational parameters such as frequency, power consumption and dissipation, functional integrity (as described in the register transfer level code) and electrical integrity.

When all known bugs have been rectified and these have been re-verified and all physical design checks are done, the physical design files describing each layer of the chip are sent to the foundry's mask shop where a full set of glass lithographic masks will be etched.  These are sent to a wafer fabrication plant to create the SoC dice before packaging and testing.

SoCs can be fabricated by several technologies, including:

* [[Full custom]] ASIC
* [[Standard cell]] ASIC
* [[Field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA)

ASICs consume less power and are faster than FPGAs but cannot be reprogrammed and are expensive to manufacture. FPGA designs are more suitable for lower volume designs, but after enough units of production ASICs reduce the total cost of ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://numato.com/blog/differences-between-fpga-and-asics/|title=FPGA vs ASIC: Differences between them and which one to use? – Numato Lab Help Center|website=numato.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

SoC designs consume less power and have a lower cost and higher reliability than the multi-chip systems that they replace. With fewer packages in the system, assembly costs are reduced as well.

However, like most [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) designs, the total cost{{Clarification needed|reason=what kind of cost?|date=May 2018}} is higher for one large chip than for the same functionality distributed over several smaller chips, because of [[Semiconductor device fabrication#Device test|lower yields]]{{What|reason=confusing to non-experts|date=May 2018}} and higher [[non-recurring engineering]] costs.

When it is not feasible to construct an SoC for a particular application, an alternative is a [[system in package]] (SiP) comprising a number of chips in a single [[chip carrier|package]].  When produced in large volumes, SoC is more cost-effective than SiP because its packaging is simpler.&lt;ref&gt;[[EE Times]]. "[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1153043 The Great Debate: SOC vs. SIP]." March 21, 2005. Retrieved July 28, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Another reasons SiP may be preferred is [[waste heat]] may be too high in a system-on-chip for a given purpose because functional components are too close together, and in an SiP heat will dissipate better from different functional modules being physically further apart.

== Benchmarks ==
{{Expand section|date=October 2018}}
SoC [[research and development]] often compares many options.  Benchmarks, such as COSMIC,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ece.ust.hk/~eexu/COSMIC.html|title=COSMIC|website=www.ece.ust.hk|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; are developed to help such evaluations.

'''Thin Film Electronics ASA''' ([[Oslo Stock Exchange]] : [http://www.oslobors.no/ob_eng/markedsaktivitet/stockOverview?newt__ticker=THIN THIN]) is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[printed electronics]] company, headquartered in [[Oslo]] with its main R&amp;D offices in [[Linköping]], [[Sweden]] and [[San Jose, California]], [[United States]].
Thin Film Electronics ASA ("Thinfilm") maintains an NFC Innovation Center at its San Jose, California location, and also has sales offices in [[San Francisco]], [[Scandinavia]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Shanghai]], [[Singapore]], and [[Hong Kong]]. Thinfilm produces rewriteable [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile memories]] based on [[ferroelectric polymers]] using [[roll-to-roll]] printing and labels based on [[Near Field Communication|Near Field Communication (NFC)]] technology.

Thinfilm offers several products that leverage printed electronics technology, including NFC SpeedTap(tm), NFC OpenSense(tm), EAS (electronic article surveillance) tags, and temperature-sensing smart labels. In February 2017, Thinfilm launched its CNECT Software Portal, a multi-tenant cloud-based platform that integrates with its NFC SpeedTap and OpenSense tags.

Thinfilm has been developing memories based on polymer materials since 1994; first as part of [[Opticom ASA]] and then as an independent company. For the first ten years, the focus was on hybrid memory devices with polymer-based memory and silicon-based control circuitry, as developed jointly with [[Intel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/27/intel_invests_in_plastic_memory/ Doubles its stake in 'Flash killer' Polymer RAM producer] The Inquirer, 27 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006, Thinfilm has concentrated its efforts on printed electronics.

Thinfilm successfully demonstrated [[roll-to-roll]] printed [[Organic electronics|organic]] memory in 2009, and was awarded IDTechEx Technical Development Manufacturing Award the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.printedelectronicsworld.com/articles/winners_of_the_idtechex_printed_electronics_europe_awards_00001368.asp Thinfilm and InkTec awarded IDTechEx' Technical Development Manufacturing Award] IDTechEx, 15 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4084606/PolyIC-ThinFilm-announce-pilot-of-volume-printed-plastic-memories PolyIC, ThinFilm announce pilot of volume printed plastic memories] EETimes, 22 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.printedelectronicsworld.com/articles/all_set_for_high_volume_production_of_printed_memories_00002179.asp All set for high-volume production of printed memories] Printed Electronics World, 12 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.printedelectronicsnow.com/articles/2010/05/thin-film-electronics-plans-to-provide-memory-ever Thin Film Electronics Plans to Provide ‘Memory Everywhere’] Printed Electronics Now, May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Thinfilm was selected by web 2.0 blog GigaOM as one of its Top 15 Mobile companies that are changing or could potentially change the mobile landscape in a significant way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mobile 15: Our picks for the most innovative companies|url=http://gigaom.com/2012/09/18/gigaom-mobile-15/|publisher=GigaOM|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014 Thinfilm acquired the assets of [[Kovio]] and opened the Thinfilm [[Near field communication|NFC]] Innovation Center in San Jose.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thinfilm.no/investor-relations/market-announcements/page/6/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:TF Barbadillo NFC campaign.jpg|alt=Thinfilm NFC mobile solution as implemented by Barbadillo for its "Tap &amp; Win" marketing campaign|thumb|300x300px|Bodegas Barbadillo has implemented Thinfilm's NFC [[solution]] for its "Tap &amp; Win" marketing campaign.]]

==Technology==
Thinfilm's printed NFC products feature "PDPS" (printed dopant polysilicon) technology based on a hybrid manufacturing process that leverages print methods in key process steps. By combining conventional fabrication techniques with functional printing, the process is optimized for high throughput, low-cost production without sacrificing device performance. The high-mobility silicon inks used in the manufacturing process ensure critical circuit performance at the RF frequencies used in Thinfilm's NFC products.

For Thinfilm Memory(tm), the [[ferroelectric polymers|ferroelectric polymer]]  is sandwiched between two sets of electrodes in a passive matrix. Each crossing of metal lines is a [[ferroelectric capacitor]] and defines a memory cell. This gives a [[non-volatile memory]] comparable to [[ferroelectric RAM]] technologies and offer the same functionality as [[flash memory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/design/memory-design/4217720/Printed-non-volatile-rewritable-ferro-electric-memorie Printed non-volatile rewritable ferro-electric memories] EETimes, July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Thinfilm's patented [[passive matrix]] dispenses with the need of active [[circuitry]] within the memory cell. It allows the memory to be separate from the read/write electronics enabling stand alone application without integration with printed logic. The passive array memory architecture also enables high density memories as well as the possibility to stack memory layers on top of each other.

The printed memory technology was licensed to Xerox in December 2014 and marketed as of June 2016 as Xerox Printed Memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Printed Memory Labels |url=https://www.xerox.co.uk/en-gb/insights/printed-memory-labels |date=10 January 2015 |publisher=[[Xerox|Xerox Corporation]] |accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In October 2013, Thinfilm produced the first ever electronically printed stand-alone sensor system. The sensor was built in the form of a temperature tracking label and is expected to go into production in Q4 of 2015.

In February 2015, Thinfilm demonstrated a connected "smart bottle" at the [[Mobile World Congress]] in Barcelona. This announcement coincided with the launch of NFC OpenSense(tm), Thinfilm's patent-pending printed sensor tags that provide smartphone-centric readability before and after a product is opened.

==Partnerships==

Thinfilm is working with [[PARC (company)|PARC]], a subsidiary of [[Xerox]], to combine its memory technology with PARC's printed [[transistor]] technology to enable fully printed memory systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.printedelectronicsnow.com/news/2010/10/13/thinfilm_works_with_parc_to_develop_next-generation_printed_memory_solutions Thinfilm Works with PARC to Develop Next-Generation Printed Memory Solutions] Printed Electronics Now, 13 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-news/4209572/Thinfilm-Xerox-PARC-team-on-polymer-memory Thinfilm, PARC team on polymer memory] EETimes, 13 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''treadwheel''', or '''treadmill''', is a form of [[engine]] typically powered by humans. It may resemble a [[water wheel]] in appearance, and can be worked either by a human treading paddles set into its circumference (treadmill), or by a human or animal standing inside it (treadwheel). These devices are no longer used for power or punishment, and the term "[[treadmill]]" has come to mean an [[exercise machine]] for running or walking in place.

==History==
Uses of treadwheels included raising water, to [[treadmill crane|power cranes]], or grind grain. They were used extensively in the Greek and Roman world, such as in the [[reverse overshot water-wheel]] used for dewatering purposes. They were widely used in the [[Middle ages]] to lift the stones in the soaring [[Gothic cathedral]]s. There is a literary reference to one in 1225, &lt;ref name="Andrea Matthies, p.515"&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=515}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one treadwheel crane survives at [[Chesterfield, Derbyshire]] and is housed in the Museum. It has been dated to the early 14th century and was housed in the top of the church tower until its removal in 1947. They were used extensively in the [[Renaissance]] famously by [[Brunelleschi]] during the construction of [[Florence cathedral]].

[[Image:Archscrew2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Roman drainage treadwheel from [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] mines, [[Spain]]]]

[[Penal treadmill]]s were used in [[prisons]] during the early-Victorian period in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|UK]] as a form of punishment. According to ''[[The Times]]'' in 1827, and reprinted in [[William Hone]]'s ''Table-Book'' in 1838, the amount prisoners walked per day on average varied, from the equivalent of 6,600 vertical feet at [[Lewes]] to as much as 17,000 vertical feet in ten hours during the summertime at [[Warwick]] gaol.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ct=result&amp;id=6-E8AAAAIAAJ&amp;jtp=755 "Tread Mills"], in ''The Every-day Book and Table Book; or, Everlasting Calendar of Popular Amusements, Sports, Pastimes, Ceremonies, Manners, Customs, and Events, Each of the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Days, in Past and Present Times; Forming a Complete History of the Year, Months, and Seasons, and a Perpetual Key to the Almanac, Including Accounts of the Weather, Rules for Health and Conduct, Remarkable and Important Anecdotes, Facts, and Notices, in Chronology, Antiquities, Topography, Biography, Natural History, Art, Science, and General Literature; Derived from the Most Authentic Sources, and Valuable Original Communication, with Poetical Elucidations, for Daily Use and Diversion. Vol III.'', ed. William Hone, (London: 1838) p 755.&lt;/ref&gt;In 1902, the British government banned the use of the treadwheel as a form of punishment. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/victorian-prison/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shepherds Flat Wind Farm 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Shepherds Flat Wind Farm]] is an 845&amp;nbsp;MW wind farm in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]].]]

A '''wind farm''' or '''wind park''' is a group of [[wind turbine]]s in the same location used to produce electricity. A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines and cover an extended area of hundreds of square miles, but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes. A wind farm can also be located offshore.

Many of the largest operational onshore wind farms are located in China, India, and the United States. For example, the [[List of onshore wind farms|largest wind farm in the world]], [[Gansu Wind Farm]] in China has a capacity of over 6,000&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt|MW]] as of 2012,&lt;ref name="Guardian-2012.03.19"&gt;Watts, Jonathan &amp; Huang, Cecily.

Retrieved 4 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; with a goal of 20,000&amp;nbsp;MW by 2020. As of September 2018, the 659&amp;nbsp;MW [[Walney Wind Farm]] in the UK is [[List of offshore wind farms#Top 25 operational offshore wind farms|the largest offshore wind farm in the world]].&lt;ref name=guardianworldslargest&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/06/worlds-largest-offshore-windfarm-opens-cumbrian-coast-walney-extension-brexit|title=World's largest offshore wind farm opens off Cumbrian coast|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual wind turbine designs continue to increase in power, resulting in fewer turbines being needed for the same total output. See [[List of most powerful wind turbines|list of most powerful wind turbines]].

== Design and location ==
[[File:United States Wind Resources and Transmission Lines map.jpg|thumb|Map of available wind power over the United States. Color codes indicate wind power density class]]
The location is critical to the success of a wind farm. Conditions contributing to a successful wind farm location include: wind conditions, access to electric transmission, physical access, and local electric prices.

The faster the average windspeed the more electricity the wind turbine will generate, so faster winds are economically better for wind farm developers. The balancing factor is that strong gusts and high turbulence require stronger more expensive turbines, otherwise they risk damage. The ideal wind conditions would be strong steady winds with low turbulence coming from a single direction.

Usually sites are screened on the basis of a [[wind atlas]], and validated with wind measurements. [[Meteorology|Meteorological]] wind data alone is usually not sufficient for accurate siting of a large wind power project. Collection of site specific data for wind speed and direction is crucial to determining site potential&lt;ref name=eweaFact&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W0dre8-5FAYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=da Wind energy-- the facts: a guide to the technology, economics and future of wind power] page 32 ''[[EWEA]]'' 2009.

[[File:Biglow Canyon Wind Farm under construction.jpg|thumb|Part of the [[Biglow Canyon Wind Farm]], [[Oregon]], United States with a turbine under construction]]
The wind blows faster at higher altitudes because of the reduced influence of drag. The increase in velocity with altitude is most dramatic near the surface and is affected by topography, surface roughness, and upwind obstacles such as trees or buildings.

How closely to space the turbines together is a major factor in wind farm design. The closer the turbines are together the more the upwind turbines block wind from their neighbors. However spacing turbines far apart increases the costs of roads and cables, and raises the amount of land needed to install a specific capacity of turbines. As a result of these factors, turbine spacing varies by site. Generally speaking manufacturers require 3.5 times the rotor diameter of the turbine between turbines as a minimum. Closer spacing is possible depending on the turbine model, the conditions at the site, and how the site will be operated.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

[[wikt:onshore|Onshore]] turbine installations in hilly or mountainous regions tend to be on ridges generally three kilometres or more inland from the nearest shoreline. This is done to exploit the [[topographic acceleration]] as the wind accelerates over a ridge. The additional wind speeds gained in this way can increase energy produced because more wind goes through the turbines. The exact position of each turbine matters, because a difference of 30m could potentially double output. This careful placement is referred to as 'micro-siting'.

== Offshore installations ==

{{See also|Offshore wind power|List of offshore wind farms|Lists of offshore wind farms by country}}

Europe is the leader in offshore wind energy, with [[Vindeby Offshore Wind Farm|the first offshore wind farm (Vindeby)]] being installed in Denmark in 1991. As of 2010, there are 39 offshore wind farms in waters off Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, with a combined operating capacity of 2,396 MW. More than 100 GW (or 100,000 MW) of offshore projects are proposed or under development in Europe. The [[European Wind Energy Association]] has set a target of 40 GW installed by 2020 and 150 GW by 2030.&lt;ref name=eesi2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eesi.org/files/offshore_wind_101310.pdf |title=Offshore Wind Energy |author=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |author-link=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Asof|2017}}, The [[Walney Wind Farm]] in the United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 659 [[Megawatt|MW]], followed by the [[London Array]] (630 MW) also in the UK.

Offshore wind turbines are less obtrusive than turbines on land, as their apparent size and noise is mitigated by distance. Because water has less surface roughness than land (especially deeper water), the average wind speed is usually considerably higher over open water. [[Capacity factor]]s (utilisation rates) are considerably higher than for onshore locations.&lt;ref name="Garvinel2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garvine | first1 = Richard | last2 = Kempton | first2 = Willett | title = Assessing the wind field over the continental shelf as a resource for electric power | journal = Journal of Marine Research | year = 2008 | volume = 66 | issue = 6 | pages = 751–773 | issn = 0022-2402 | url = http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/windpower/docs/GarvineKemp-AssessingWind09.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 30 November 2009 | doi = 10.1357/002224008788064540 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720083622/http://www.ceoe.udel.edu/windpower/docs/GarvineKemp-AssessingWind09.pdf | archivedate = 20 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, there were no offshore wind farms in the United States, but projects were under development in wind-rich areas of the East Coast, Great Lakes, and Pacific coast;&lt;ref name=eesi2010/&gt; and in late 2016 the [[Block Island Wind Farm]] was commissioned.

Installation and service / maintenance of off-shore wind farms are a specific challenge for technology and economic operation of a wind farm. {{asof|2015}}, there are 20 [[Jackup rig|jackup vessels]] for lifting components, but few can lift sizes above 5MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tu.no/industri/skip/2016/01/15/slik-utstyres-de-norske-skipene-for-a-takle-nye-gigant-vindmoller|title=Slik utstyres de norske skipene for å takle nye gigant-vindmøller|author=Jannicke Nilsen|work=Tu.no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Service vessels have to be operated nearly 24/7 (availability higher than 80% of time) to get sufficient amortisation from the wind turbines.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Therefore, special fast service vehicles for installation (like Wind Turbine Shuttle) as well as for maintenance (including heave compensation and heave compensated working platforms to allow the service staff to enter the wind turbine also at difficult weather conditions) are required. So-called inertial and optical based Ship Stabilization and Motion Control systems (iSSMC) are used for that.

== Experimental and proposed wind farms ==
There exist also some wind farms which were mainly built for testing wind turbines. In such wind farms, there is usually from each type to be tested only a single wind turbine. Such farms have usually at least one meteorological tower. An example of an experimental wind farm is [[Østerild Wind Turbine Test Field]].

For some time, airborne wind farms have been discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/AWES_Farm_Density.pdf AWES Farm Density] ''Airborne Wind Energy Labs'', March 2014. Retrieved 20 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; An airborne wind farm is a group of airborne wind energy systems near to each other, connected to the grid in the same point.

According to the [[Global Wind Energy Council]], the development of wind energy in China, in terms of scale and rhythm, is absolutely unparalleled in the world. The [[National People's Congress]] permanent committee passed a law that requires the Chinese energy companies to purchase all the electricity produced by the renewable energy sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instalbiz.com/news/3-full-news-cn-china-ranks-third-in-worldwide-wind-energy_129.html |title=CN : China ranks third in worldwide wind energy – Alternative energy news |publisher=Instalbiz.com |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europe's largest windfarm is the '[[London Array]]', an off-shore wind farm in the [[Thames Estuary]] in the [[United Kingdom]], with a current capacity of 630 MW (the world's largest off-shore wind farm). Other large wind farms in Europe include [[Fântânele-Cogealac Wind Farm]] near [[Constanța]], Romania with 600 MW capacity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.cez.cz/en/power-plants-and-environment/wind-power-plant/fantanele-cegealac-wind-park.html | title= Fantanele-Cogealac Wind Park | publisher= Cez Group | accessdate= 14 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://praguemonitor.com/2012/10/12/%C4%8Dez-says-its-wind-farm-romania-biggest-europe | title= ČEZ says its wind farm in Romania is the biggest in Europe | work= Prague Daily Monitor | date= 12 October 2012 | accessdate= 12 October 2012 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130522083617/http://praguemonitor.com/2012/10/12/%C4%8Dez-says-its-wind-farm-romania-biggest-Europe | archive-date= 22 May 2013 | dead-url= yes | df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Whitelee Wind Farm]] near [[Glasgow]], Scotland which has a total capacity of 539 MW.

An important limiting factor of wind power is [[intermittent power source|variable power]] generated by wind farms. In most locations the wind blows only part of the time, which means that there has to be back-up capacity of conventional generating capacity to cover periods that the wind is not blowing. To address this issue it has been proposed to create a "[[European super grid|supergrid]]" to connect national grids together&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/16595/|title=A Supergrid for Europe|work=MIT Technology Review|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; across [[western Europe]], ranging from Denmark across the southern [[North Sea]] to England and the [[Celtic Sea]] to Ireland, and further south to France and Spain especially in [[Higueruela]] which was for some time the biggest wind farm in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=David Cifuentes |last-author-amp=yes |author2=Víctor M. Rodríguez |url=http://www.sabuco.com/mci/essays01/2b/energy2.pdf |title=Renewable energy |page=11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203093335/http://www.sabuco.com/mci/essays01/2b/energy2.pdf |archive-date=2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea is that by the time a [[low pressure area]] has moved away from Denmark to the [[Baltic Sea]] the next low appears off the coast of Ireland. Therefore, while it is true that the wind is not blowing everywhere all of the time, it will always be blowing somewhere.

===Pakistan===
[[File:Jhimpir Wind Farm 2012.jpg|thumb|Jhimpir Wind Farm]]
Pakistan has wind corridors in Jhimpir, Gharo and Keti Bundar in Sindh province and is currently developing wind power plants in Jhimpir and Mirpur Sakro (District Thatta). The government of Pakistan decided to develop wind power energy sources due to problems supplying energy to the southern coastal regions of Sindh and Balochistan.
The Zorlu Energy Putin Power Plant is the first wind power plant in Pakistan. The wind farm is being developed in Jhimpir, by Zorlu Energy Pakistan the local subsidiary of a Turkish company. The total cost of project is $136 million.[3] Completed in 2012, it has a total capacity of around 56MW.
Fauji Fertilizer Company Energy Limited, has build a 49.5 MW wind Energy Farm at Jhimpir. Contract of supply of mechanical design was awarded to Nordex and Descon Engineering Limited. Nordex a German wind turbine manufacturer. In the end of 2011 49.6 MW will be completed.Pakistani Govt. also has issued LOI of 100 MW Wind power plant to FFCEL. Pakistani Govt. has plans to achieve electric power up to 2500 MW by the end of 2015 from wind energy to bring down energy shortage.

Currently four wind farms are operational (Fauji Fertilizer 49.5 MW (subsidiary of Fauji Foundation), Three Gorges 49.5 MW, Zorlu Energy Pakistan 56 MW, Sapphire Wind Power Co Ltd 52.6 MW) and six are under construction phase ( Master Wind Energy Ltd 52.6 MW, Sachal Energy Development Ltd 49.5 MW, Yunus Energy Ltd 49.5 MW, Gul Energy 49.5 MW, Metro Energy 49.5 MW, Tapal Energy ) and expected to achieve COD in 2017.

In Gharo wind corridor, two wind farms (Foundation Energy 1 &amp; II each 49.5 MW) are operational while two wind farms Tenaga Generasi Ltd 49.5 MW and HydroChina Dawood Power Pvt Ltd 49.5 are under construction and expected to achieve COD in 2017.

According to a USAID report, Pakistan has the potential of producing 150,000 megawatts of wind energy, of which only the Sindh corridor can produce 40,000 megawatts.

===Philippines===
The Philippines has the first windfarm in Southeast Asia. Located Northern part of the countries' biggest island Luzon, alongside the seashore of [[Bangui, Ilocos Norte|Bangui]], [[Ilocos Norte]].

The wind farm uses 20 units of 70-metre (230&amp;nbsp;ft) high Vestas V82 1.65 MW wind turbines, arranged on a single row stretching along a nine-kilometer shoreline off Bangui Bay, facing the West Philippine Sea.

Phase I of the NorthWind power project in Bangui Bay consists of 15 wind turbines, each capable of producing electricity up to a maximum capacity of 1.65 MW, for a total of 24.75 MW. The 15 on-shore turbines are spaced 326 metres (1,070&amp;nbsp;ft) apart, each 70 metres (230&amp;nbsp;ft) high, with 41 metres (135&amp;nbsp;ft) long blades, with a rotor diameter of 82 metres (269&amp;nbsp;ft) and a wind swept area of 5,281 square metres (56,840 sq ft). Phase II, was completed on August 2008, and added 5 more wind turbines with the same capacity, and brought the total capacity to 33 MW. All 20 turbines describes a graceful arc reflecting the shoreline of Bangui Bay, facing the West Philippine Sea.

Adjacent municipalities of [[Burgos, Ilocos Norte|Burgos]] and [[Pagudpud]] followed with 50 and 27 wind turbines with a capacity of 3 MW each for a Total of 150 MW and 81 MW respectively.

Two other wind farms were built outside of Ilocos Norte, the [[Pililla Wind Farm]] in Rizal and the [[Mindoro Wind Farm]] near [[Puerto Galera]] in [[Oriental Mindoro]].

===Sri Lanka===

Sri Lanka has received funding from the Asian Development Bank amounting to $300 million to invest in renewable energies. From this funding as well as $80 million from the Sri Lankan Government and $60 million from France’s Agence Française de Développement, Sri Lanka is building two 100MW wind farms from 2017 due to be completed by late 2020 in Northern Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.lk/2014/07/16/adb-grants-300-m-to-boost-renewable-energy/|title=ADB grants $ 300 m to boost renewable energy|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518083210/http://www.ft.lk/2014/07/16/adb-grants-300-m-to-boost-renewable-energy/|archive-date=18 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Public perception is that renewable energies such as wind, solar, biomass and geothermal are having a significant positive impact on global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/23/people-want-more-renewable-energy |title=Nine out of 10 people want more renewable energy |date=23 April 2012 |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these sources combined only supplied 1.3% of global energy in 2013 as 8 billion tonnes of coal was burned annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf |title=Renewables 2015 Global Status Report |publisher=[[REN21]] |year=2015 |accessdate=2015-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721013559/http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2015 |df= |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest factors inhibiting wind farm construction is human opposition. A study has shown&lt;ref&gt;Groth, Theresa M., and Christine A. Vogt. "Rural wind farm development: Social, environmental and economic features important to local residents." Renewable Energy 63.2014 (2013): 1-8. ScienceDirect. Web. 9 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; "turbine placement close to residents may heighten their uncertainty and concern of the wind turbines and overshadow any positive inclinations towards the development."

Wind farm development is affected by the emphasis being primarily placed on the domain of landscape assessment and environmental impact when seeking farm sites. The viability and efficiency of the wind farm are barely touched upon, instead falling to the developer. For example, Sturge et al.&lt;ref&gt;Sturge, D., A. While, and R. Howell. "Engineering and energy yield: The missing dimension of wind turbine assessment." Energy Policy 65.2014 (2013): 245-50. ScienceDirect. Web. 9 Feb. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; of the University of Sheffield wrote that in many countries where wind energy is becoming popular, engineering aspects, specifically energy yield are not being taken into consideration, either by the public or in the process of planning consent for wind farm development. As energy is the main purpose of wind farms, a lack of attention given to the subject could be detrimental to the general acceptance of wind farms.

Compared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor.&lt;ref name="Guezuraga37"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Begoña Guezuraga |author2=Rudolf Zauner |author3=Werner Pölz |title=Life cycle assessment of two different 2 MW class wind turbines |journal=[[Renewable Energy (journal)|Renewable Energy]] |volume=37 |issue=1 |date=January 2012 |page=37 |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2011.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind power]] consumes no fuel, and emits no [[air pollution]], unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months.&lt;ref name="Guezuraga37"/&gt; While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use.&lt;ref name=mar&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf |title=Why Australia needs wind power |author=Mark Diesendorf |journal=Dissent |issue=13 |date=Summer 2003 |pages=43-48 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706112239/http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf |archive-date=6 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human health ===
{{See also|Health effects from noise}}
There have been multiple scientific, peer-reviewed studies into wind farm noise, which have concluded that infrasound from wind farms is not a hazard to human health and there is no verifiable evidence for 'Wind Turbine Syndrome' causing [[Vibroacoustic disease]], although some suggest further research might still be useful.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cleanenergycouncil.org.au/dam/cec/technologies/wind/fact-sheets/Wind-farms-and-health-fact-sheet-Jan-2015/Wind%20farms%20and%20health%20fact%20sheet%20-%20Jan%202015.pdf 'Wind Energy - The Facts', p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 report by the U.S. National Research Council noted that noise produced by wind turbines is generally not a major concern for humans beyond a half-mile or so. Low-frequency vibration and its effects on humans are not well understood and sensitivity to such vibration resulting from wind-turbine noise is highly variable among humans.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} There are opposing views on this subject, and more research needs to be done on the effects of low-frequency noise on humans.&lt;ref name="NRC1"&gt;Committee on Environmental Impacts of Wind Energy Projects, National Research Council (2007). [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11935&amp;page=158 ''Environmental Impacts of Wind-Energy Projects'', p. 158-9].&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 report about "Rural Wind Farms", a Standing Committee of the Parliament of New South Wales, Australia, recommended a minimum setback of two kilometres between wind turbines and neighbouring houses (which can be waived by the affected neighbour) as a precautionary approach.&lt;ref name="NSW1"&gt;General Purpose Standing Committee No. 5, Parliament of New South Wales (16 December 2009). [http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/ea247659081d31fdca25768e001a2e2a/$FILE/091216%20Report%20-%20Rural%20wind%20farms.pdf "Final Report, Rural Wind Farms"].&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 paper suggests that the 'Wind Turbine Syndrome' is mainly caused by the [[nocebo]] effect and other psychological mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Novella2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=GJ|last2=Burns|first2=M|last3=Wessely|first3=S|authorlink3=Simon Wessely|title=Possible psychological mechanisms for "wind turbine syndrome".

=== Effect on power grid ===
{{See also|Wind power#Electricity generation}}

Utility-scale wind farms must have access to transmission lines to transport energy. The wind farm developer may be obliged to install extra equipment or control systems in the wind farm to meet the technical standards set by the operator of a transmission line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BUFFALO GAP WIND FARM, L.L.C., BUFFALO GAP WIND FARM 2, L.L.C., AND BUFFALO GAP WIND FARM 3, L.L.C.'S APPEAL AND COMPLAINT OF ERCOT'S DECISION AND ACTION REGARDING PRR 830 AND MOTION FOR SUSPENSION OF ACTION|url=http://www.ercot.com/content/about/governance/legal/notices/37827_Buffalo_Gap_Wind_Farm_Appeal_Complaint_PRR_830.pdf|website=ERCOT.com|publisher=ERCOT|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company or person that develops the wind farm can then sell the power on the grid through the transmission lines and ultimately chooses whether to hold on to the rights or sell the farm or parts of it to big business like GE, for example.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

=== Ground radar interference ===
[[File:NOAA windturbine-radar-interference.gif|thumb|Wind farm interference (in yellow circle) on radar map]]

Wind farms can interfere with ground [[radar]] systems used for [[military]], [[Weather radar|weather]] and [[air traffic control]]. The large, rapidly moving blades of the turbines can return signals to the radar that can be mistaken as an aircraft or weather pattern.&lt;ref name="noaaWR"&gt;[http://www.crh.noaa.gov/mkx/?n=windfarm Wind farm interference showing up on Doppler radar] ''[[National Weather Service]]''.

==== Effects ====
The level of interference is a function of the signal processors used within the radar, the speed of the aircraft and the relative orientation of wind turbines/aircraft with respect to the radar. An aircraft flying above the wind farm's turning blades could become impossible to detect because the blade tips can be moving at nearly aircraft velocity. Studies are currently being performed to determine the level of this interference and will be used in future site planning.&lt;ref name="gsnWR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodwin|first= Jacob|url= http://www.gsnmagazine.com/node/22124?c=airport_aviation_security |title=DHS asks Raytheon to study impact of wind turbines on radar systems|website=gsnmagazine.com|date= 3 January 2011|accessdate= 9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues include masking (shadowing), clutter (noise), and signal alteration.&lt;ref name="wefWR"&gt;[http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/de/environment/chapter-2-environmental-impacts/ship-collisions-radars-and-radio-signals.html Radars and radio signals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407155949/http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/de/environment/chapter-2-environmental-impacts/ship-collisions-radars-and-radio-signals.html |date=7 April 2011 }} ''Wind Energy Facts''.

Wind turbines can often cause terrestrial television interference when the direct path between television transmitter and receiver is blocked by terrain. Interference effects become significant when the reflected signal from the turbine blades approaches the strength of the direct unreflected signal. Reflected signals from the turbine blades can cause loss of picture, pixellation and disrupted sound. There is a common misunderstanding that digital TV signals will not be affected by turbines — in practice they are.

A 2010 study found that in the immediate vicinity of wind farms, the climate is cooler during the day and slightly warmer during the night than the surrounding areas due to the turbulence generated by the blades.&lt;ref name=agriwind1&gt;Roy, Somnath Baidya. [http://www.pnas.org/content/107/42/17899.abstract?sid=47909b69-b82f-49d4-97d9-debb5d1ff65b Impacts of wind farms on surface air temperatures] ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', 4 October 2010. Retrieved 10 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study an analysis carried out on [[corn]] and [[soybean]] crops in the central areas of the United States noted that the microclimate generated by wind turbines improves crops as it prevents the late spring and early autumn frosts, and also reduces the action of pathogenic fungi that grow on the leaves. Even at the height of summer heat, the lowering of 2.5–3 degrees above the crops due to turbulence caused by the blades, can make a difference for the cultivation of corn.&lt;ref name=agriwind2&gt;Takle, Gene and Lundquist, Julie.

The '''[[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] DSP-1''' is a processor of early home theater [[surround sound]] equipment, produced in 1985. The DSP-1 (referred to by Yamaha as a Digital Soundfield Processor) allowed owners to synthesize up to 6-channels of surround sound from 2 channel stereo sound via a complex [[digital signal processor]] (DSP).  Much like today's home theater receivers the DSP-1 offered sixteen "sound fields" created through the DSP including a [[jazz]] club, a [[cathedral]], a concert hall, and a [[stadium]].  However, unlike today's integrated [[Audio power amplifier|amps]] and [[Radio receiver|receivers]], these soundfield modes were highly editable, allowing the owner to customize the effect to his or her own personal taste. The DSP-1 also included an analog [[Dolby Surround]] decoder as well as other effects such as real-time echo and pitch change.     

Most of the DSP-1's controls are on the unit's remote control. The reason, as mentioned in the manual, being that it was felt that adjustments should be done at the listening position. This can make it difficult for collectors to find a complete functioning unit, although there is at least one provider of aftermarket remote controls with duplicate programming for the DSP-1 if needed. In Dolby Surround mode, only 4 channels are active, with just the front main channels and rear surround channels operating, the forward surround channels being muted.  

Yamaha has kept the DSP prefix for many of its home DSP and audio amp/receiver products.
