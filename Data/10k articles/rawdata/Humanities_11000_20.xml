'''''A Fair Cop''''' is a 2008 memoir by Michael Bunting, a former British [[police officer]]. After attending an incident during the course of his duties, Bunting was found guilty of [[common assault]] of a member of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michael Bunting endured every cop's worst nightmare... being banged up in jail with criminals|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/michael-bunting-endured-every-cops-342131|accessdate=20 September 2012|newspaper=Mirror|date=28 Sep 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bunting claims that he is innocent of the crime and tells his side of the story in ''A Fair Cop''. The book was published by [[The Friday Project]], with the book currently being written to become a [[Drama film|screen drama]].&lt;ref name="Bunting344"&gt;{{cite book |title= A Fair Cop |last= Bunting|first= Michael |authorlink= |year= 2008 |publisher= Friday Books|location= London |isbn= 978-1-906321-92-5|page= 344|pages=|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Bunting is now a [[restorative justice]] campaigner.

==Summary==
The book follows Bunting's narration of the events that lead up to his sentencing on September 8, 1999, when Bunting was sentenced to spend four months at HMP [[Armley Prison]] for charges of common assault. During his prison sentence Bunting was physically threatened and verbally abused by the other inmates, who also tampered with his food. Because of these threats, Bunting is placed in the hospital wing for his own safety.

Bunting then details his time at the [[West Yorkshire Police]] Training School, his formal acceptance into the service where he is given his father's old [[West Riding Constabulary]]'s collar number, and his reactions to some of the situations he had to respond to as a police officer. Bunting later joins the [[Police Support Unit]] and helps in trying to quell the [[Bradford Riots]].

On August 24, 1997, Bunting responds to a domestic disturbance report at a private residence where he and two other officers encounter two males. One is immediately arrested, but the other grows increasingly more hostile and Bunting warns him that exhibiting such behavior could result in his arrest. Bunting is then assaulted by the man, receiving numerous injuries such as a broken tooth and swelling to his left cheek and eye. One of the other officers uses [[CS spray]] in an attempt to quell the attack, but sprays Bunting in the process. Later Bunting is examined by a doctor for his injuries, having also experienced difficulty with his vision. The doctor concludes that the disturbance in vision was attributable to an injury Bunting sustained during the attack.

Five weeks later the Discipline and Complaints Department then inform Bunting that he is under investigation for an assault because a member of the public complained about his conduct during the incident. Bunting is later charged with common assault due to his attacker accused him of using excessive force while Bunting was attempting to defend himself and subdue his attacker. Bunting was also forced to give his home address in open court at Wakefield Magistrates Court, where his assaulter and the media are present. He requests that he be allowed to give his address in a written format, which is denied. The case is held on 26 July 1999 at [[Leeds Crown Court]], where conflicting witness testimony is given and medical evidence shows that Bunting's attacker did not sustain any injuries. Despite this, Bunting is found guilty on the common assault charge.

Bunting serves part of his sentence at HMP Armley in Leeds. He spends much of his time in his cell, reading [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]]'s autobiography, reciting song lyrics, and practicing his faith. Bunting avoids much of the prison staff and populace, speaking primarily to the prison chaplain Bill Foster and physician Steve Ferguson. In the book, Bunting asserts that his faith greatly assisted him during his time in prison.

'''Abstract art''' uses a [[visual language]] of shape, form, color and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph Arnheim, ''Visual Thinking'', University of California Press, 1969, {{ISBN|0520018710}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Western art]] had been, from the [[Renaissance]] up to the middle of the 19th century, underpinned by the logic of [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality. The arts of cultures other than the European had become accessible and showed alternative ways of describing visual experience to the artist. By the end of the [[19th century]] many artists felt a need to create a new kind of art which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in [[technology]], [[science]] and [[philosophy]]. The sources from which individual artists drew their theoretical arguments were diverse, and reflected the social and intellectual preoccupations in all areas of Western culture at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Mel Gooding, ''Abstract Art'', [[Tate Publishing Ltd|Tate Publishing]], London, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Abstract art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and non-representational art are loosely related terms. They are similar, but perhaps not of identical meaning.

Abstraction indicates a departure from reality in depiction of [[image]]ry in art. This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. Abstraction exists along a continuum. Even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is likely to be exceedingly elusive. Artwork which takes liberties, altering for instance color and form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially abstract. Total abstraction bears no trace of any reference to anything recognizable. In [[geometric abstraction]], for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. [[Figurative art]] and total abstraction are almost [[Mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]]. But figurative and [[Representation (arts)|representational]] (or [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]]) art often contains partial abstraction.

Both geometric abstraction and [[lyrical abstraction]] are often totally abstract. Among the very numerous [[art movements]] that embody partial abstraction would be for instance [[fauvism]] in which color is conspicuously and deliberately altered vis-a-vis reality, and [[cubism]], which blatantly alters the forms of the real life entities depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://painting.about.com/od/abstractart/a/abstract_art.htm |title=Abstract Art – What Is Abstract Art or Abstract Painting, retrieved January 7, 2009 |publisher=Painting.about.com |date=2011-06-07 |accessdate=2011-06-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707075052/http://painting.about.com/od/abstractart/a/abstract_art.htm| archivedate= 7 July 2011 &lt;!-- DASHBot --&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm |title=Themes in American Art – Abstraction, retrieved January 7, 2009 |publisher=Nga.gov |date=2000-07-27 |accessdate=2011-06-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608093226/http://www.nga.gov/education/american/abstract.shtm |archivedate=8 June 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abstraction in early art and many cultures ==
{{Main article|Prehistoric art|Eastern art history}}

Much of the art of earlier cultures – signs and marks on pottery, textiles, and inscriptions and paintings on rock – used simple, geometric and linear forms which might have had a symbolic or decorative purpose.&lt;ref&gt;György Kepes, ''Sign, Image and Symbol'', [[Studio Vista]], London, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; It is at this level of visual meaning that abstract art communicates.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Hyatt,"Meeting on the Moor", ''[[Modern Painters]]'', Autumn 1995&lt;/ref&gt; One can enjoy the beauty of [[Chinese calligraphy]] or [[Islamic calligraphy]] without being able to read it.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Leys, 2013.

[[File:Immortal in Splashed Ink.jpg|thumb|left|''Immortal in splashed ink'', Liang Kai, China, 12th century]]
In Chinese painting, abstraction can be traced to the [[Tang dynasty]] painter Wang Mo (王墨), who is credited to have invented the splashed-ink painting style.&lt;ref&gt;Lippit, Y. (2012). "Of Modes and Manners in Japanese Ink Painting: Sesshū's Splashed Ink Landscape of 1495". ''The Art Bulletin'', 94(1), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; While none of his paintings remain, this style is clearly seen in some [[Song Dynasty]] Paintings. The [[Chan Buddhism|Chan buddhist]] painter Liang Kai (梁楷, c. 1140–1210) applied the style to figure painting in his "Immortal in splashed ink"  in which accurate representation is sacrificed to enhance spontaneity linked to the non-rational mind of the enlightened. A late Song painter named Yu Jian, adept to [[Tiantai|Tiantai buddhism]], created a series of splashed ink landscapes that eventually inspired many Japanese zen painters. His paintings show heavily misty mountains in which the shapes of the objects are barely visible and extremely simplified. This type of painting was continued by [[Sesshu Toyo]] in his later years.
[[File:Yujian ink Mercadodemontaña.jpg|thumb|right|''Mountain market, clearing Mist'', Yu Jian, China]]
Another instance of abstraction in Chinese painting is seen in Zhu Derun's [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Zhu_Derun_-_Primordial_Chaos_(painting_only).jpeg ''Cosmic Circle'']. On the left side of this painting is a pine tree in rocky soil, its branches laced with vines that extend in a disorderly manner to the right side of the painting in which a perfect circle (probably made with help of a compass&lt;ref&gt;Watt, J. C. (2010). ''The World of Khubilai Khan: Chinese Art in the Yuan Dynasty''. Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;) floats in the void. The painting is a reflection of the [[Daoism|Daoist]] metaphysics in which chaos and reality are complementary stages of the regular course of nature.
In Tokugawa Japan some zen monk-painters created [[Enso]], a circle who represents the absolute enlightenment. Usually made in one spontaneous brush stroke, it became the paradigm of the minimalist aesthetic that guided part of the zen painting.

Patronage from the church diminished and private patronage from the public became more capable of providing a livelihood for artists.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich, "The Early Medici as Patrons of Art" in ''[[Norm and Form]]'', pp. 35–57, London, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Balfe, ed. ''Paying the Piper: Causes and Consequences of Art Patronage'', Univ. of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Three [[art movement]]s which contributed to the development of abstract art were [[Romanticism]], [[Impressionism]] and [[Expressionism]]. Artistic independence for artists was advanced during the 19th century. An ''objective interest in what is seen'', can be discerned from the paintings of [[John Constable]], [[J M W Turner]], [[Camille Corot]] and from them to the Impressionists who continued the ''[[plein air]]'' painting of the [[Barbizon school]].

A near abstraction, in 1877 Whistler sued the art critic [[John Ruskin]] for libel after the critic condemned this painting. Ruskin accused Whistler of "ask[ing] two hundred [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] for throwing a pot of paint in the public's face."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.princeton.edu/wri152-3/rpower/archives/001951.html Whistler versus Ruskin, Princeton edu.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616062046/http://blogs.princeton.edu/wri152-3/rpower/archives/001951.html |date=June 16, 2010 }} Retrieved June 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/turnerwhistlermonet/wvr.htm From the Tate], retrieved April 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Early intimations of a new art had been made by [[James McNeill Whistler]] who, in his painting ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold: The falling Rocket]]'', (1872), placed greater emphasis on visual sensation than the depiction of objects.

[[Expressionism|Expressionist]] painters explored the bold use of paint surface, drawing distortions and exaggerations, and intense color. Expressionists produced emotionally charged paintings that were reactions to and perceptions of contemporary experience; and reactions to [[Impressionism]] and other more conservative directions of late 19th-century painting. The Expressionists drastically changed the emphasis on subject matter in favor of the portrayal of psychological states of being. Although artists like [[Edvard Munch]] and [[James Ensor]] drew influences principally from the work of the [[Post-Impressionists]] they were instrumental to the advent of abstraction in the 20th century.
[[Paul Cézanne]] had begun as an Impressionist but his aim – to make a logical construction of reality based on a view from a single point,&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Read, ''A Concise History of Modern Art'', Thames and Hudson&lt;/ref&gt; with modulated color in flat areas – became the basis of a new visual art, later to be developed into [[Cubism]] by [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]].

[[File:Yellow Curtain.jpg|thumb|[[Henri Matisse]], ''[[Le rideau jaune|The Yellow Curtain]]'', 1915. With his [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] color and drawing Matisse comes very close to pure abstraction.]] Additionally in the late 19th century in Eastern Europe [[mysticism]] and early [[Modernism|modernist]] religious philosophy as expressed by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Helena Blavatsky|Mme. Blavatsky]] had a profound impact on pioneer [[Geometric abstraction|geometric]] artists like [[Hilma af Klint]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. The mystical teaching of [[Georges Gurdjieff]] and [[P.D. Ouspensky]] also had an important influence on the early formations of the geometric abstract styles of [[Piet Mondrian]] and his colleagues in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Mondrian---mysticism---ldquo-My-long-search-is-over-rdquo--4237 |title=Hilton Kramer, "Mondrian &amp; mysticism: My long search is over", ''New Criterion'', September 1995 |publisher=Newcriterion.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 20th century ==
{{main article|Western painting|Fauvism|Cubism|}}

[[Post Impressionism]] as practiced by [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Paul Cézanne]] had an enormous impact on [[20th-century art]] and led to the advent of 20th-century abstraction. The heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[Cézanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of [[modern art]]. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with "wild", multi-colored, expressive landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. With his expressive use of color and his free and imaginative drawing Henri Matisse comes very close to pure abstraction in ''French Window at Collioure'' (1914), ''[[View of Notre-Dame]]'' (1914), and ''[[Le rideau jaune|The Yellow Curtain]]'' from 1915. The raw language of color as developed by the [[Fauvism|Fauves]] directly influenced another pioneer of abstraction, [[Wassily Kandinsky]].

Although [[Cubism]] ultimately depends upon subject matter, it became, along with [[Fauvism]], the art movement that directly opened the door to abstraction in the 20th century. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on Cézanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' (1907), Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[Analytic cubism]] was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[Synthetic cubism]], practiced by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and others into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier collé]] and a large variety of merged subject matter. The collage artists like [[Kurt Schwitters]] and [[Man Ray]] and others taking the clue from [[Cubism]] were instrumental to the development of the movement called [[Dada]].

The Italian poet [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] published the [[Manifesto of Futurism]] in 1909, which later inspired artists such as [[Carlo Carra]] in ''Painting of Sounds, Noises and Smells'' and [[Umberto Boccioni]] ''Train in Motion'', 1911, to a further stage of abstraction that would, along with [[Cubism]], profoundly influenced art movements throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Tisdall and Angelo Bozzolla, ''Futurism'', Thames and Hudson, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1912 Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], where [[František Kupka]] exhibited the abstract painting ''Amorpha, Fugue en deux couleurs'' (''Fugue in Two Colors'') (1912), the poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] named the work of several artists including [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Section d'or, 1912–1920–1925'', Cécile Debray, Françoise Lucbert, Musées de Châteauroux, Musée Fabre, exhibition catalogue, Éditions Cercle d'art, Paris, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He defined it as, "the art of painting new structures out of elements that have not been borrowed from the visual sphere, but had been created entirely by the artist...it is a pure art."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison and Wood, ''Art in theory, 1900–2000'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2003, p. 189. {{ISBN|978-0631227083}}.[https://books.google.com/books?id=SWu4SB92fHMC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Apollinaire+on+Art books.google.com"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the turn of the century, cultural connections between artists of the major European cities had become extremely active as they strove to create an art form equal to the high aspirations of [[modernism]]. Ideas were able to cross-fertilize by means of artist's books, exhibitions and [[art manifesto|manifestos]] so that many sources were open to experimentation and discussion, and formed a basis for a diversity of modes of abstraction. The following extract from ''The World Backwards'' gives some impression of the inter-connectedness of culture at the time: "[[David Burliuk]]'s knowledge of modern art movements must have been extremely up-to-date, for the second [[Russian avant-garde|Knave of Diamonds exhibition]], held in January 1912 (in Moscow) included not only paintings sent from Munich, but some members of the German [[Die Brücke]] group, while from Paris came work by [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Fernand Léger]], as well as Picasso. During the Spring David Burliuk gave two lectures on cubism and planned a polemical publication, which the Knave of Diamonds was to finance.

And the search continued: The [[Rayonism|Rayist]] (Luchizm) drawings of [[Natalia Goncharova]] and [[Mikhail Larionov]], used lines like rays of light to make a construction. [[Kasimir Malevich]] completed his first entirely abstract work, the [[Suprematist]], ''Black Square'', in 1915. Another of the Suprematist group' [[Liubov Popova]], created the Architectonic Constructions and Spatial Force Constructions between 1916 and 1921. [[Piet Mondrian]] was evolving his abstract language, of horizontal and vertical lines with rectangles of color, between 1915 and 1919, [[Neo-Plasticism]] was the aesthetic which Mondrian, Theo van Doesburg and other in the group [[De Stijl]] intended to reshape the environment of the future.

== Music ==

As visual art becomes more abstract, it develops some characteristics of music: an art form which uses the abstract elements of sound and divisions of time. [[Wassily Kandinsky]], himself an amateur musician,&lt;ref&gt;Shawn, Allen. 2003. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qgqp5-EqEw8C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq= Arnold Schoenberg's Journey]''. Harvard University Press. p. 62. {{ISBN|0674011015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;François Le Targat, ''Kandinsky'', Twentieth Century masters series, Random House Incorporated, 1987, p. 7, {{ISBN|0847808106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan B. Hirschfeld, Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Hilla von Rebay Foundation, ''Watercolors by Kandinsky at the Guggenheim Museum: a selection from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum and the Hilla von Rebay Foundation'', 1991. In 1871 the family moved to Odessa, where the young Kandinsky attended the Gymnasium and learned to play the cello and piano.&lt;/ref&gt; was inspired by the possibility of marks and associative color ''resounding in the soul.'' The idea had been put forward by [[Charles Baudelaire]], that all our senses respond to various stimuli but the senses are connected at a deeper aesthetic level.

Closely related to this, is the idea that art has ''The spiritual dimension'' and can transcend 'every-day' experience, reaching a spiritual plane. The [[Theosophical Society]] popularized the ancient wisdom of the sacred books of India and China in the early years of the century. It was in this context that [[Piet Mondrian]], Wassily Kandinsky, [[Hilma af Klint]] and other artists working towards an 'objectless state' became interested in the occult as a way of creating an 'inner' object.
The universal and timeless shapes found in [[geometry]]: the circle, square and triangle become the spatial elements in abstract art; they are, like color, fundamental systems underlying visible reality.

== Russian avant-garde ==

[[File:Black Square.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kazimir Malevich]], ''Black Square'', 1923, [[The Russian Museum]]]]

{{main article|Russian avant-garde|Futurism (art)|}}

Many of the abstract artists in Russia became [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivists]] believing that art was no longer something remote, but life itself. The artist must become a technician, learning to use the tools and materials of modern production. ''Art into life!'' was [[Vladimir Tatlin]]'s slogan, and that of all the future Constructivists. [[Varvara Stepanova]] and Alexandre Exter and others abandoned easel painting and diverted their energies to theatre design and graphic works.
On the other side stood [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Anton Pevsner]] and [[Naum Gabo]]. They argued that art was essentially a spiritual activity; to create the individual's place in the world, not to organize life in a practical, materialistic sense. Many of those who were hostile to the materialist production idea of art left Russia. Anton Pevsner went to France, Gabo went first to Berlin, then to England and finally to America. Kandinsky studied in Moscow then left for the [[Bauhaus]]. By the mid-1920s the revolutionary period (1917 to 1921) when artists had been free to experiment was over; and by the 1930s only [[socialist realism]] was allowed.&lt;ref&gt;Camilla Gray, ''The Russian Experiment in Art, 1863–1922'', Thames and Hudson, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Bauhaus ==

The [[Bauhaus]] at Weimar, Germany was founded in 1919 by [[Walter Gropius]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter Gropius et al., ''Bauhaus 1919–1928'' Herbert Bayer ed., Museum of Modern Art,publ. Charles T Banford,Boston,1959&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy underlying the teaching program was unity of all the visual and plastic arts from architecture and painting to weaving and stained glass. This philosophy had grown from the ideas of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in England and the [[Deutscher Werkbund]]. Among the teachers were [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Johannes Itten]], [[Josef Albers]], [[Anni Albers]], and [[László Moholy-Nagy]]. In 1925 the school was moved to Dessau and, as the [[Nazi party]] gained control in 1932, The Bauhaus was closed. In 1937 an exhibition of [[degenerate art]], 'Entartete Kunst' contained all types of [[avant-garde]] art disapproved of by the Nazi party. Then the exodus began: not just from the Bauhaus but from Europe in general; to Paris, London and America. Paul Klee went to Switzerland but many of the artists at the Bauhaus went to America.

== Abstraction in Paris and London ==

[[File:DasUndbild.jpg|thumb|[[Kurt Schwitters]], ''Das Undbild'', 1919, Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]]

During the 1930s Paris became the host to artists from Russia, Germany, the Netherlands and other European countries affected by the rise of [[totalitarianism]]. [[Sophie Tauber]] and [[Jean Arp]] collaborated on paintings and sculpture using organic/geometric forms. The Polish [[Katarzyna Kobro]] applied mathematically based ideas to sculpture. The many types of abstraction now in close proximity led to attempts by artists to analyse the various conceptual and aesthetic groupings. An exhibition by forty-six members of the [[Cercle et Carré]] group organized by [[Joaquin Torres-Garcia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seuphor|first1=Michel|title=Geometric Abstraccion 1926-1949|date=1972|publisher=Dallas Museum of Fine Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; assisted by [[Michel Seuphor]]&lt;ref&gt;Michel Seuphor, ''Abstract Painting''&lt;/ref&gt; contained work by the Neo-Plasticists as well as abstractionists as varied as Kandinsky, Anton Pevsner and [[Kurt Schwitters]]. Criticized by [[Theo van Doesburg]] to be too indefinite a collection he published the journal ''Art Concret'' setting out a manifesto defining an abstract art in which the line, color and surface only, are the concrete reality.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Moszynska, ''Abstract Art'', p. 104, Thames and Hudson, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Abstraction-Création founded in 1931 as a more open group, provided a point of reference for abstract artists, as the political situation worsened in 1935, and artists again regrouped, many in London. The first exhibition of British abstract art was held in England in 1935. The following year the more international ''Abstract and Concrete'' exhibition was organized by [[Nicolete Gray]] including work by [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Ben Nicholson]]. Hepworth, Nicholson and Gabo moved to the [[St. Ives group]] in Cornwall to continue their 'constructivist' work.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Moszynska, ''Abstract Art'', Thames and Hudson, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

== America: mid-century ==
{{main article|Modernism|Late modernism|American Modernism|Surrealism|}}

[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1939-1942 - Composition 10.jpg|thumb|left|The above is a 1939–42 oil on canvas painting by Mondrian titled ''Composition No. 10''. Responding to it, fellow [[De Stijl]] artist [[Theo van Doesburg]] suggested a link between non-representational works of art and ideals of peace and spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Utopian Reality: Reconstructing Culture in Revolutionary Russia and Beyond; Christina Lodder, Maria Kokkori, Maria Mileeva; BRILL, Oct 24, 2013 "Van Doesburg stated that the purpose of art was to imbue man with those positive spiritual qualities that were needed in order to overcome the dominance of the physical and create the conditions for putting an end to wars. In an enthusiastic essay on Wassily Kandinsky he had written about the dialogue between the artist and the viewer, and the role of art as 'the educator of our inner life, the educator of our hearts and minds'. Van Doesburg subsequently adopted the view that the spiritual in man is nurtured specifically by abstract art, which he later described as 'pure thought, which does not signify a concept derived from natural phenomena but which is contained in numbers, measures, relationships, and abstract lines'. In his response to Piet Mondrian's ''Composition 10'', Van Doesburg linked peace and the spiritual to a non-representational work of art, asserting that 'it produces a most spiritual impression…the impression of repose: the repose of the soul'."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During the Nazi rise to power in the 1930s many artists fled Europe to the United States. By the early 1940s the main movements in modern art, expressionism, cubism, abstraction, [[surrealism]], and [[dada]] were represented in New York: [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[André Masson]], [[Max Ernst]], [[André Breton]], were just a few of the exiled Europeans who arrived in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Naylor, ''The Bauhaus'', Studio Vista, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The rich cultural influences brought by the European artists were distilled and built upon by local New York painters. The climate of freedom in New York allowed all of these influences to flourish. The art galleries that primarily had focused on European art began to notice the local art community and the work of younger American artists who had begun to mature. Certain artists at this time became distinctly abstract in their mature work. During this period Piet Mondrian's painting ''Composition No. 10'', 1939–1942, characterized by primary colors, white ground and black grid lines clearly defined his radical but classical approach to the rectangle and abstract art in general.
Some artists of the period defied categorization, such as [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] who, while a modernist abstractionist, was a pure maverick in that she painted highly abstract forms while not joining any specific group of the period.

Eventually American artists who were working in a great diversity of styles began to coalesce into cohesive stylistic groups. The best known group of American artists became known as the [[Abstract expressionists]] and the [[New York School (art)|New York School]]. In New York City there was an atmosphere which encouraged discussion and there was new opportunity for learning and growing. Artists and teachers [[John D. Graham]] and [[Hans Hofmann]] became important bridge figures between the newly arrived European Modernists and the younger American artists coming of age. [[Mark Rothko]], born in Russia, began with strongly surrealist imagery which later dissolved into his powerful color compositions of the early 1950s. The [[action painting|expressionistic gesture]] and the act of painting itself, became of primary importance to [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Robert Motherwell]], and [[Franz Kline]]. While during the 1940s [[Arshile Gorky]]'s and [[Willem de Kooning]]'s figurative work evolved into abstraction by the end of the decade. New York City became the center, and artists worldwide gravitated towards it; from other places in America as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Geldzahler]], ''New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940–1970'', Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later developments ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
{{main article|Abstract expressionism|Color field|Lyrical abstraction|Post-painterly abstraction|Sculpture|Minimal art|}}

[[Digital art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[geometric abstraction]], [[minimalism]], [[lyrical abstraction]], op art, abstract expressionism, color field painting, [[monochrome painting]], [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]], neo-Dada, [[shaped canvas]] painting, are a few directions relating to abstraction in the second half of the 20th century.

In the United States, ''Art as Object'' as seen in the [[Minimalist]] sculpture of [[Donald Judd]] and the paintings of [[Frank Stella]] are seen today as newer permutations. Other examples include [[Lyrical Abstraction]] and the sensuous use of color seen in the work of painters as diverse as [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Patrick Heron]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Joan Mitchell]].

== Causation ==

One socio-historical explanation that has been offered for the growing prevalence of the abstract in modern art – an explanation linked to the name of [[Theodor W. Adorno]] – is that such abstraction is a response to, and a reflection of, the growing abstraction of social relations in [[industrial society]].&lt;ref&gt;David Cunningham, 'Asceticism Against Colour', in ''New Formations'' 55 (2005) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederic Jameson]] similarly sees modernist abstraction as a function of the abstract power of money, equating all things equally as exchange-values.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; The social ''content'' of abstract art is then precisely the abstract nature of social existence – legal formalities, bureaucratic impersonalization, information/power – in the world of [[late modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Analytical psychology#Post-Jungian approaches|Post-Jungians]] by contrast would see the quantum theories with their disintegration of conventional ideas of form and matter as underlying the divorce of the concrete and the abstract in modern art.&lt;ref&gt;Aniela Jaffé, in C. G. Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (1978) pp. 288–89, 303&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aerial video''' is an emerging form of [[data acquisition]] for scene understanding and object tracking. The video is captured by low flying aerial platforms that integrate [[Global Positioning System]]s (GPS) and automated [[image processing]] to improve the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of data collection and reduction. Recorders can incorporate in-flight voice records from the cockpit intercom system. The addition of audio narration is an extremely valuable tool for documentation and communication. GPS data is incorporated with a text-captioning device on each [[film frame|video frame]]. Helicopter platforms enable "low and slow" flights, acquiring a continuous visual record without motion blur.

Innovations in [[remote sensing]] cameras have allowed the identification of objects that could not have been previously identified. Pipeline and power corridors and their infrastructure can be documented with [[digital media]] recording. Video Mapping System is an example of how this technology is used today.

Since the 1980s, aerial videography has seen increased use in applications where its advantages over traditional photography (lower cost and immediate availability of data) outweigh its disadvantages (poorer [[spatial resolution]] and difficulty of analysis due to lack of [[stereo imaging]]) (Mausel et al. 1992; Meisner 1986). King (1995) provides a comprehensive review of the evolution of video sensors and their applications, many of which focused on:
# The measurement of transient phenomena such as wildlife populations (Sidle and Ziewits 1990; Strong  and Cowardin 1995) and pest infestations (Everitt et al. 1994);
# Mapping of dynamic land features such as wetland plant communities (Jennings et al. 1992) and coastal &lt;br /&gt; land forms (Eleveld et al. 2000);
# Land cover mapping in remote areas with limited existing aerial photography and poor infrastructure &lt;br /&gt;(Marshet al. 1994; Slaymaker and Hannah 1997).

'''[[Aniconism]]''' is a proscription in [[Islam]] against the creation of images of sentient beings. The most absolute proscription is of images of [[God in Islam]], followed by [[depictions of Muhammad]], and then [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophets]] and the [[Ahl al-Bayt|relatives of Muhammad]], but the depiction of all humans and non-human animals is discouraged in the ''[[hadith]]'' and by the long tradition of Islamic authorities, especially [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] ones. This has led to [[Islamic art]] being dominated by [[Islamic geometric patterns]], [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], the barely representational foliage patterns of the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]], and the 'half-formed' figures (e.g. wings without a body) of [[batik|Indonesian art]]; but [[figurative art]] still has a strong tradition, especially on a small scale in private works for the home or palace. The proliferation of photographic and filmed images today has led to controversy, with some religious authorities stating, for example, that all television is un-Islamic, but this is not a widely held position.

==Theological views==
The [[Quran]], the [[Islamic holy books|Islamic holy book]], does not explicitly prohibit the depiction of human figures; it merely condemns [[idolatry]].&lt;ref name=Esposito&gt;{{cite book|last=Esposito|first=John L.|title=What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199794133|pages=14–15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnN6wvw8zVQC&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|87|end=92|s=ns}}, {{Cite quran|21|51|end=52|s=ns|expand=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interdictions of figurative representation are present in the hadith, among a dozen of the hadith recorded during the [[History of Islam|latter part of the period]] when they were being written down. Because these hadith are tied to particular events in the life of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], they need to be interpreted in order to be applied in any general manner.

Sunni [[Exegesis|exegetes]] or ''[[tafsir]]'', from the 9th century onward, increasingly saw in them categorical prohibitions against producing and using any representation of living beings. There are variations between religious ''[[madhhab]]'' (schools) and marked differences between different [[Islamic schools and branches|branches of Islam]]. Aniconism is common among [[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] Sunni sects such as [[Salafi]]s and [[Wahhabi]]s (which are also often [[Iconoclasm|iconoclastic]]), and less prevalent among [[liberal movements within Islam]]. [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Sufism|mystical orders]] also have less stringent views on aniconism. On the individual level, whether or not specific Muslims believe in aniconism may depend on how much credence is given to hadith, and how liberal or strict they are in personal practice.

Aniconism in Islam not only deals with the material image, but touches upon mental representations as well. It is a problematic issue, discussed by early [[Theology|theologians]], as to how to describe [[God]], Muhammad and other prophets, and, indeed, if it is permissible at all to do so. God is usually represented by immaterial attributes, such as "holy" or "merciful", commonly known from His "[[Names of God in Islam|Ninety-nine beautiful names]]". Muhammad's physical appearance, however, is amply described, particularly in the traditions on his life and deeds recorded in the biographies known as ''[[Prophetic biography|Sirah Rasul Allah]]''. Of no less interest is the validity of sightings of holy personages made during dreams.

[[Titus Burckhardt]] sums up the role of aniconism in Islamic aesthetics as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The absence of icons in Islam has not merely a negative but a positive role. By excluding all anthropomorphic images, at least within the religious realm, Islamic art aids man to be entirely himself. Instead of projecting his soul outside himself, he can remain in his ontological centre where he is both the viceregent (''khalîfa'') and slave ('''abd'') of God. Islamic art as a whole aims at creating an ambience which helps man to realize his primordial dignity; it therefore avoids everything that could be an 'idol', even in a relative and provisional manner. Nothing must stand between man and the invisible presence of God. Thus Islamic art creates a void; it eliminates in fact all the turmoil and passionate suggestions of the world, and in their stead creates an order that expresses equilibrium, serenity and peace.&lt;ref name="Burckhardt1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Titus Burckhardt|title=Mirror of the intellect: essays on traditional science &amp; sacred art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1K9ELNioz18C|accessdate=12 December 2011|date=1 October 1987|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-88706-684-9|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In practice==

=== Religious core ===
In practice, the core of normative religion in Islam is consistently aniconic. Its embodiment are spaces such as the [[mosque]] and objects like the Quran or the white dress of [[pilgrim]]s entering [[Mecca]], deprived of figurative images. Other spheres of religion (mysticism, popular piety, private level) exhibit in this regard significant variability. Aniconism in secular contexts is even more fluctuating. Generally speaking, aniconism in Islamic societies is restricted in modern times to specific religious contexts. In the past, it was enforced only in some times and places.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Past===
The representation of living beings in Islamic art is not just a modern phenomenon or because of current technology, Westernization or the [[cult of personality|cult of the personality]]. [[Fresco]]s and [[relief]]s of humans and animals adorned palaces of the [[Umayyad caliphate|Umayyad]] era, as on the famous [[Mshatta Facade]] now in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonic.net/~tallen/palmtree/fe2.htm Allen, Terry, "Aniconism and Figural Representation in Islamic Art", Palm Tree Books] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165946/http://www.sonic.net/~tallen/palmtree/fe2.htm |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/educational_site/arch_sites/qamra.shtml Educational Site: Archaeological Sites: Qusayr `Amra] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826041708/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/wsrp/educational_site/arch_sites/qamra.shtml |date=August 26, 201y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figurative miniatures in books occur later in most [[Muslim world|Islamic countries]] but somewhat less in Arabic-speaking areas. The human figure is central to the [[Persian miniature]] and other traditions such as the [[Ottoman miniature]] and [[Mughal painting]], and represents a good deal of the attractiveness of Islamic art for non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rezaabbasimuseum.ir/ Reza Abbasi Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927103634/http://www.rezaabbasimuseum.ir/ |date=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~history/portraits.html "Portraits of the Sultans," Topkapi Palace Museum] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120154526/http://www.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~history/portraits.html |date=November 20, 2008

[[Devil (Islam)|Iblis]] (the [[Devil]]) also is present in various illustrated manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20050322105638/http://www.antiqillum.com/slideshows/Nativities/ "The Book of Nativities(Kitâb al-Mawalid) by Abû Ma'shar," Antiquities of the Illuminati]&lt;/ref&gt; The prohibition on the depiction of God has, as far as is known, remained absolute at all times.

[[File:Pisa-Opera del Duomo-Grifone islamico000.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pisa Griffin]], probably created in the 11th century in [[Al-Andalus]], is the largest Islamic figurative sculpture to survive.]]
The avoidance of idolatry is the main concern of the restrictions on images, and the traditional form for religious cult image, the free-standing sculpture, is extremely rare, and there are no large examples of humans. The [[Pisa Griffin]], of a [[Legendary creature|mythical beast]] and designed to spout water for a fountain, is the largest example, at three feet tall in bronze, and probably only survives because it was taken as booty by the city of [[Pisa]] in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Pisa+Griffin&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=D-KxTZvfO4TD8QO4_4CWDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Pisa%20Griffin&amp;f=false Mack, p. 3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610125727/https://books.google.com/books?id=09sA4SNG2dYC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Pisa+Griffin&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=D-KxTZvfO4TD8QO4_4CWDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Pisa%20Griffin&amp;f=false |date=June 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the famous lions supporting a fountain in the [[Alhambra]], it probably came from [[Al-Andalus]], one of the more relaxed Arabic-speaking regions in this respect. The [[griffin]] and lions cannot easily be regarded as potential idols, given their submissive position (and the lack of religions worshipping lions or griffins), and the same is true of small decorative figures in relief on objects in metalwork, or figures painted on [[Islamic pottery]], both of which are relatively common. In particular [[hunting]] scenes of humans and animals were popular, and presumably regarded as clearly having no religious function. The figures in miniatures were, until the late 16th century, always numerous in each image, small (typically only an inch or two high), and showing the central figures at roughly the same size as the attendants and servants who are usually also shown, thus deflecting potential accusations of idolatry. The books illustrated were most often the classics of [[Persian literature|Persian poetry]] and historical [[chronicle]]s.

The hadith show some concessions for context, as with the dolls, and condemn most strongly the makers rather than the owners of images. A long tradition of prefaces to ''[[muraqqa]]s'' sought to justify the creation of images without getting involved in discussions of the specific texts, using arguments such as comparing God to an artist.

Miniature painting was mostly patronized by the court circle and is a private form of art; the owner chooses who to show a book or ''muraqqa'' (album). But wall-paintings with large figures were found in early Islam, and in Safavid and later Persia, especially from the 17th century, but were always rare in the Arabic-speaking world. Such paintings are also mainly found in private palaces; examples in public buildings are rare though not unknown, in [[Iran]] there are even some in mosques.

In Islamic sacred architecture, ornamentation consists mainly in arabesques and [[geometry|geometrical]] patterns.&lt;ref name=void/&gt; Mosques do not feature dynamic elements, but aim for a quality of serenity and repose.&lt;ref name=void/&gt; Similarly, weight-bearing elements are not designed along [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] lines to present an image of physical strength; [[cupola]]s for example often feature [[muqarnas]] disguising the transition between the cupola and its supports, creating the impression that the supports, rather than holding up the cupola, have "congealed" from the divine void above.&lt;ref name=void&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Titus Burckhardt]] |title=The Void in Islamic Art |journal=Studies in Comparative Religion |volume=4 |issue=2 |date=Spring 1970 |url=http://qa.studiesincomparativereligion.com/Public/articles/browse_g.aspx?ID=130 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426050237/http://qa.studiesincomparativereligion.com/Public/articles/browse_g.aspx?ID=130 |archivedate=2012-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Present===
Depending on which segment of Islamic societies are referred to, the application of aniconism is characterized by noteworthy differences.&lt;ref&gt;See '[[Sura]]' and 'Taswir' in ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Factors are the epoch considered, the country, the religious orientation, the political intent, the popular beliefs, the private benefit or the dichotomy between reality and discourse.

Today, the concept of an aniconic Islam coexists with a daily life for Muslims awash with images. TV stations and newspapers (which do present still and moving representations of living beings) have an exceptional impact on public opinion, sometimes, as in the case of [[Al Jazeera]], with a global reach, beyond the Arabic speaking and Muslim audience. Portraits of secular and religious leaders are omnipresent on banknotes&lt;ref&gt;[http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/SaudiNote22a.html Petroleum-related banknotes: Saudi Arabia: Oil Refinery] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720014731/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/SaudiNote22a.html |date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/IranNote91c.html Petroleum-related banknotes: Iran: Abadan Refinery, Iahanshahi-Amouzegar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720015444/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/staff/scholle/graphics/banknotes/IranNote91c.html |date=July 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and coins, in streets and offices (e.g. presidents like [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] and [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]], [[Yasser Arafat|Arafat]], [[Hafez al-Assad|al-Assad]] or [[Hezbollah]]'s [[Hassan Nasrallah|Nasrallah]] and [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]]). Anthropomorphic statues in public places are to be found in most Muslim countries ([[Saddam Hussein]]'s are infamous&lt;ref&gt;[http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Jul/05/mn/mn03a.html David Zucchino "U.S. military, not Iraqis, behind toppling of statue" ''Honolulu Advertiser'', July 5, 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192226/http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2004/Jul/05/mn/mn03a.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as art schools training sculptors and painters. In the [[Egypt]]ian countryside, it is fashionable to celebrate and advertise the returning of pilgrims from Mecca on the walls of their houses.

The [[Taliban]] movement in [[Afghanistan]] banned photography and destroyed non-Muslim artifacts, especially carvings and statues such as the [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]], generally tolerated by other Muslims, on the grounds that the artifacts are idolatrous or ''[[shirk (Islam)|shirk]]''. However, sometimes those who profess aniconism will practice figurative representation (cf. portraits of Talibans from the [[Kandahar]] photographic studios during their imposed ban on photography&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Lee Anderson]], [[Thomas Dworzak]], ''Taliban'', London (UK), Trolley, 2003, {{ISBN|0-9542648-5-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;).

For Shia communities, portraits of the major figures of Shiite history are important elements of religious devotion. In Iran, portraits of Muhammad and of [[Ali]], printed on pieces of cloth or woven into carpets, are called ''temsal'' ("likenesses") and can be bought around shrines and in the streets, to be hung in homes or carried with oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dabashi|first=Hamid|title=Shi'ism - A Religion of Protest|year=2011|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA |pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] portraits of Ali can be found on notoriously ornate trucks,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200502/masterpieces.to.go.the.trucks.of.pakistan.htm Saudi Aramco World : Masterpieces to Go: The Trucks of Pakistan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008035126/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200502/masterpieces.to.go.the.trucks.of.pakistan.htm |date=October 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; buses and rickshaws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webpak.net/~ricksha/ The Rickshaw Arts of Bangladesh] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021211125/http://www.webpak.net/~ricksha/ |date=October 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the Sunni tradition, a photographic picture of the deceased can be placed on the Shiite tombs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traveladventures.org/continents/asia/golestaneshohada2.shtml Picture of Golestan e Shohoda cemetery Esfahan -Esfahan, Iran] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018075410/http://www.traveladventures.org/continents/asia/golestaneshohada2.shtml |date=October 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestirantravel.com/sights/mashad/martyrscemetry.html Mashad Martyrs Cemetery at Best Iran Travel.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407170105/http://www.bestirantravel.com/sights/mashad/martyrscemetry.html |date=April 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A curiosity in Iran is an [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] photography supposed to represent Muhammad as a young boy.&lt;ref&gt;Photography by Lehnert &amp; Landrock, titled "Mohamed", Tunis, c. 1906.

[[File:Miraj by Sultan Muhammad.jpg|thumb|Persian miniature painting from the 16th century, depicting Muhammad, his face veiled, ascending on the [[Buraq]] into the Heavens, a journey known as the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Mi'raj]].]]
Medieval Muslim artists found various ways to represent especially sensitive figures such as Muhammad. He is sometimes shown with a fiery [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] hiding his face, head, or whole body, and from about 1500 is often shown with a veiled face. Members of his immediate family and other prophets may be treated in the same way. More generally, it can be believed that since God is absolute, the act of depiction is his own and not that of a human; and miniatures are obviously very crude representations of the reality, so the two cannot be mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3232,36-737929@51-735567,0.html LeMonde.fr : JEAN-FRANÇOIS CLÉMENT « Cette affaire de caricatures participe d'une mentalité de «victimisation» » des musulmans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the material level, prophets in manuscripts can have their face covered by a veil&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; or all humans have a stroke drawn over their neck, symbolising the severing of the soul, and clarifying the fact that it is not something alive and imbued with a soul that is depicted: a purposeful flaw to make what is depicted impossible to live in reality (as merely impossible in reality is still often frowned upon or banned, such as representations of comic book characters or unicorns, although exceptions do exist). Calligraphy, the most Islamic of arts in the Muslim world, has also its figurative side due to anthropo- and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] [[Islamic calligraphy#Calligrams|calligrams]]. Few portraits were attempted, and the ability to create recognisable portraits was rare in Islamic art until the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] tradition began in the late 15th century, although in both Mughal India and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turkey portraits of the ruler then became very popular in court circles.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[File:Hilye-i serif 2.jpg|thumb|left|A [[hilya]] or description in calligraphy of the appearance of [[Muhammad]] by the Ottoman calligrapher [[Hâfiz Osman]] (d. 1698).]]
Forms of Islamic calligraphy evolved, especially in the Ottoman period, to fulfill a function similar to that of representative art by means of calligraphic representation, when on paper usually with elaborate frames of [[Ottoman illumination]]. These include the name of Muhammad, the ''[[hilya]]'', or description of his physical appearance, similar treatments of one or more of the names of God in Islam, and the ''[[tughra]]'', a calligraphic version of the name of an Ottoman [[sultan]].

===Hadith and exegesis examples===

During its early days, aniconism in Islam was intended as a measure against idolatry, particularly against the statues worshipped by [[Paganism|pagans]]. All hadith presented in this section are Sunni, not Shia.

{{Quote|Narrated [[Aisha]]:&lt;br&gt;(the [[Muhammad's wives|wife of the Prophet]]) I bought a cushion having on it pictures (of animals). When [[Allah]]'s Apostle saw it, he stood at the door and did not enter. I noticed the sign of disapproval on his face and said, "O Allah's Apostle! I repent to Allah and His Apostle. What [[Islamic views on sin|sin]] have I committed?' Allah's Apostle said. "What is this cushion?" I said, "I have bought it for you so that you may sit on it and recline on it." Allah's Apostle said, "The makers of these pictures will be punished on the [[Islamic eschatology|Day of Resurrection]], and it will be said to them, 'Give life to what you have created (i.e., these pictures).' " The Prophet added, "The Angels of (Mercy) do not enter a house in which there are pictures (of animals)."|[[Muhammad al-Bukhari]]|''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|318}}, {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes-usc|7|62|110}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Narrated Aisha, Ummul [[Mu'min]]in:&lt;br&gt;When the Apostle of Allah ([[Peace be upon him (Islam)|peace be upon him]]) arrived after the [[Battle of Tabouk|expedition to Tabuk]] or [[Battle of Khaybar|Khaybar]] (the narrator is doubtful), the draught raised an end of a curtain which was hung in front of her store-room, revealing some dolls which belonged to her.&lt;br&gt;He asked: What is this? She replied: My dolls. Among them he saw a horse with wings made of rags, and asked: What is this I see among them? She replied: A horse. He asked: What is this that it has on it? She replied: Two wings. He asked: A horse with two wings? She replied: Have you not heard that Solomon had horses with wings? She said: Thereupon the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) laughed so heartily that I could see his molar teeth.|[[Abu Dawood]]|''[[Sunan Abu Dawood]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|41|4914}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Narrated Ali ibn Abu Talib:&lt;br&gt;Safinah AbuAbdurRahman said that a man prepared food for Ali ibn Abu Talib who was his guest, and Fatimah said: I wish we had invited the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) and he had eaten with us. They invited him, and when he came he put his hands on the side-ports of the door, but when he saw the figured curtain which had been put at the end of the house, he went away. So Fatimah said to Ali: Follow him and see what turned him back. I (Ali) followed him and asked: What turned you back, Apostle of Allah? He replied: It is not fitting for me or for any Prophet to enter a house which is decorated.|Abu Dawood|''Sunan Abu Dawood''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|27|3746}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Narrated 'Aisha:&lt;br&gt;Allah's Apostle returned from a journey when I had placed a curtain of mine having pictures over (the door of) a chamber of mine. When Allah's Apostle saw it, he tore it and said, "The people who will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be those who try to make the like of Allah's creations." So we turned it (i.e., the curtain) into one or two cushions.|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|838}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To show the superiority of the [[Monotheism|monotheist]] faith, Muhammad smashed the idols at the [[Kaaba]]. He also removed paintings that were [[Islam and blasphemy|blasphemous to Islam]], while protecting others (the images of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and Jesus) inside the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Life of Muhammad. A translation of Ishaq's "Sirat Rasul Allah" | publisher=Oxford University Press | last=Guillaume | first=Alfred | authorlink=Alfred Guillaume | year=1955 | page=552 | isbn=978-0-19-636033-1 | url=https://archive.org/details/IbnIshaq-SiratRasulAllah-translatorA.Guillaume | accessdate=2011-12-08}} Also discussed in {{cite web |url=http://answering-islam.org/Index/K/kabah.html |title=Ka'bah |work=Comparative Index to Islam |publisher=Islam: A Christian-Muslim Dialog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hadith below emphasizes that aniconism depends not only on ''what'', but also on ''how'' things are depicted.

{{Quote|Narrated [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|Ibn Abbas]]:&lt;br&gt;When Allah's Apostle arrived in Mecca, he refused to enter the Ka'ba while there were idols in it. So he ordered that they be taken out. The pictures of the (Prophets) Abraham and [[Ishmael]], holding arrows of divination in their hands, were carried out. The Prophet said, "May Allah ruin them (i.e. the [[infidel]]s) for they knew very well that they (i.e. Abraham and [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]]) never drew lots by these (divination arrows). Then the Prophet entered the Ka'ba and said. "[[Takbir|Allahu Akbar]]" in all its directions and came out and not offer any prayer therein.|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|59|584}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Muslim b. Subaih reported: I was with Masriuq in the house which had the portrayals of Mary ([[hadrat]] [[Mary in Islam|Maryan]]). Thereupon Masriuq said: These are portraits of Kisra. I said: No, these are of Mary. Masruq said: I heard [[Abdullah, son of Masud|Abdullah b, Mas'ud]] as saying Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said: The most grievously tormented people on the Day of Resurrection would be the painters of pictures. (Muslim said): I read this before Nasr b. 'Ali at-Jahdami and he read it before other narrators, the last one being Ibn Sa'id b Abl at Hasan that a person came to Ibn 'Abbas and said: I am the person who paints pictures; give me a religious verdict about them. He (Ibn 'Abbas) said to him: Come near me (still further). He came near him so much so that he placed his hand upon his head and said: I am going to narrate to yor what I heard from Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him). I heard him say: All the painters who make pictures would be in the fire of [[Hell]]. The soul will be breathed in every picture prepared by him and it shall punish him in the Hell, and he (Ibn 'Abbas) said: If you have to do it at all, then paint the pictures of trees and lifeless things; and Nasr b. 'Ali confirmed it.|[[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj]]|''[[Sahih Muslim]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|24|5272}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although [[Arabian mythology|pagans in Muhammad's times]] also worshiped trees and stones, Muhammad opposed only images of animated beings — humans and animals —, as reported by the hadith. Subsequently, geometrical ornamentation became a sophisticated art form in Islam.

{{Quote|Narrated Said bin Abu Al-Hasan:&lt;br&gt;While I was with Ibn 'Abbas a man came and said, "O [[‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib|father of 'Abbas]]! My sustenance is from my manual profession and I make these pictures." Ibn 'Abbas said, "I will tell you only what I heard from Allah's Apostle . I heard him saying, 'Whoever makes a picture will be punished by Allah till he puts life in it, and he will never be able to put life in it.' " Hearing this, that man heaved a sigh and his face turned pale. Ibn 'Abbas said to him, "What a pity! If you insist on making pictures I advise you to make pictures of trees and any other unanimated objects."|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|428}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|A'isha reported: We had a curtain with us which had portraits of birds upon it. Whenever a visitor came, he found them in front of him. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to me: Change them, for whenever I enter the room) I see them and it brings to my mind (the pleasures) of worldly life. She said: We had with us a sheet which had silk badges upon it and we used to wear it. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Ibn Muthanna but with this addition: 'Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) did not command us to tear that."|Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|''Sahih Muslim''&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|24|5255}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|A'isha reported: Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) visited me. and I had a shelf with a thin cloth curtain hangin. over it and on which there were portraits. No sooner did he see it than he tore it and the colour of his face underwent a change and he said: A'isha, the most grievous torment from the Hand of Allah on the Day of Resurrection would be for those who imitate (Allah) in the act of His creation. A'isha said: We tore it into pieces and made a cushion or two cushions out of that.|Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|''Sahih Muslim''&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|24|5261}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mohammad also warned his followers of dying amongst people that built places of worship at graves and placed pictures in it (i.e. [[Christian]]s).
{{Quote| Narrated 'Aisha:&lt;br&gt;When the Prophet became ill, some of his wives talked about a [[Church (building)|church]] which they had seen in [[Ethiopia]] and it was called Mariya. [[Umm Salama Hind bint Abi Umayya|Um Salma]] and [[Ramla bint Abi Sufyan|Um Habiba]] had been to Ethiopia, and both of them narrated its (the Church's) beauty and the pictures it contained. The Prophet raised his head and said, "Those are the people who, whenever a pious man dies amongst them, make a place of worship at his grave and then they make those pictures in it. Those are the worst creatures in the Sight of Allah."|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|2|23|425}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mohammad made it very clear that [[angel]]s do not like pictures.
{{Quote|Narrated [[Ali ibn Abi Talha|Abu Talha]]:&lt;br&gt;Allah's Apostle said, "[[Islamic view of angels|Angels]] (of mercy) do not enter a house where there are pictures.'" The sub-narrator Busr added: "Then [[Zayd ibn Harithah|Zaid]] fell ill and we paid him a visit. Behold! There was, hanging at his door, a curtain decorated with a picture. I said to 'Ubaidullah Al-Khaulani, the step son of [[Maymuna bint al-Harith|Maimuna]], the wife of the Prophet, "Didn't Zaid tell us about the picture the day before yesterday?" 'Ubaidullah said, "Didn't you hear him saying: 'except a design in a garment'?"|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|841}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Quote|Narrated Salim's father:&lt;br&gt;Once [[Gabriel]] promised to visit the Prophet but he delayed and the Prophet got worried about that. At last he came out and found [[Holy Spirit (Islam)|Gabriel]] and complained to him of his grief (for his delay). Gabriel said to him, "We do not enter a place in which there is a picture or a dog."|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''Sahih al-Bukhari''&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|843}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other hand, there are hadith stating that Muhammad permitted dolls belonging to both his wife and daughter in his own house.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==Comparison with Judaism and Christianity==

[[Judaism]], which is related to Islam as a monotheistic faith of Adam, Abraham, [[Moses]] ([[Moses in Islam|Mūsa]]), and other prophets, has a [[Idolatry in Judaism|comparable prohibition]] which takes the form of a prohibition on any [[Cult image|idol]] or on any artistic representation of [[God in Judaism|God]]. The third of the three related religions, [[Christianity]], actively practiced aniconism in the [[Early Christianity|early Christian church]], in the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] of the 8th century, and following the [[Protestant Reformation]], when [[Calvinism]] in particular rejected [[Beeldenstorm|all images in churches]]. But it has generally had an [[Christian art|active tradition of making and venerating images]] of [[God in Christianity|God]] and other religious figures, and the movement of iconoclasm was at no time supported by the Roman papacy.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

'''The Bamberg Horseman''' ({{lang-de|Der Bamberger Reiter}}) is a stone [[equestrian sculpture|equestrian statue]] by an anonymous [[Middle Ages|medieval]] sculptor in the [[Bamberg Cathedral|cathedral]] of [[Bamberg]], [[Germany]].

== Description ==

Dating probably from the time before the consecration of the [[cathedral]]'s new building in 1237, but after 1225, it is located on a console at the north pillar of the St. George choir, it is not known whether this is the intended position of the statue although the base appears to be original and the structure of the base would seem to dissuade moving.&lt;ref&gt;P. Williamson, Gothic Sculpture, 1140-1300, 1995: pp. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation ==

Being located in a church and showing a crowned yet unarmed man, it is believed that it represents a specific king, perhaps one who was a saint.  A candidate is [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] (973-1024) who is buried in the cathedral along with [[Pope Clement II]], but he would likely have been depicted with [[Imperial Regalia]]. Another possibility is his brother-in-law, king [[Stephen I of Hungary]] (975-1038) who stops his horse and looks towards the tomb of Henry.  Another theory favours [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]], the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at the time, who financed much of the rebuilding of the cathedral.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Valentiner, ''The Bamberg Rider: Studies of Mediaeval German Sculpture'', Zeitlin &amp; Ver Brugge, 1956 [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;docId=5833510 online excerpts]&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet another theory, supported by Hannes Möhring of the [[University of Bayreuth]], holds that the figure represents the [[Messiah]] according to the [[Book of Revelation]] (19:11–16).

It is considered the first monumental equestrian statue since [[classical antiquity]], and also one of the first to depict a [[horse shoe]]. Beneath the horse's front hooves is one of the many sculptural representations of the [[Green Man]]. [[Kathleen Basford]], in her study of these figures, calls this Green Man the "dark counterpart" of the horseman.

[[Stefan George]] wrote a poem about the horseman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfgsAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PR45 |title=Secret Germany: Stauffenberg and the True Story of Operation Valkyrie |first1=Michael |last1=Baigent |first2=Richard |last2=Leigh |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing, Inc. |date=Dec 13, 2013 |isbn=9781626369092}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work influenced [[Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iablis.de/iablis_t/2007/ammonrez07.html Herbert Ammon: Vom Geist Georges zur Tat Stauffenbergs - Manfred Riedels Rettung des Reiches, in: Iablis 2007&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.iablis.de&lt;/ref&gt; the would-be assassin of Hitler who was a member of the cavalry unit ''Bamberger Reiter- und Kavallerieregiment 17'' (17th Cavalry Regiment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wgj8EWapQYgC&amp;pg=PA22 |title=Countdown to Valkyrie: The July Plot to Assassinate Hitler |first=Nigel |last=Jones |authorlink=Nigel H.

'''Chacchoben''' (chak-CHO-ben; [[Mayan languages|Maya]] for "the place of red corn") is a [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] ruin approximately 110&amp;nbsp;mi (177&amp;nbsp;km) south of [[Tulum]] and 7&amp;nbsp;mi (11&amp;nbsp;km) from the village from which it derives its name.

== History ==
Settlement by the Maya at the site is estimated at 200 BC, and the structures date from 700 AD. It is characterised by large temples and massive platform groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norman Yoffee|title=Negotiating the Past in the Past: Identity, Memory, and Landscape in Archaeological Research|date=2007|publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]]|isbn=9780816526703|page=193|url=https://books.google.com.ua/books?id=58WgTin1ORsC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern discovery ==
In the 1940s a farm was established near the site by the Cohuo family, but the ruins were officially reported to the [[Mexico|Mexican]] government in June 1972 by Dr. Peter Harrison, an [[United States|American]] [[archaeologist]] who was working on a project for The Royal Ontario Museum, and who also made the first maps of Chacchoben. Harrison stumbled upon this site while flying a helicopter over Mexico and noticed numerous hills in predominately flat lands.  Harrison realized there were temples beneath these hills, which were naturally covered over a period of 2000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Justine M. Shaw, Jennifer P. Mathews|title=Quintana Roo Archaeology|date=2005|publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]]|isbn=9780816524419|page=198|edition=illustrated}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Restoration ==
In 1994 the Mexican [[National Institute of Anthropology and History]] (INAH) excavated and restored the site, which was closed to the public until 2002.

== Chacchoben today ==

Visitors to the site today walk a circular path that includes three excavated and restored pyramids, as well as many walls and staircases.  Excavation is continuing on several mounds which are known to contain further buildings.  Some structures still bear traces of the red paint with which they were originally coated, and [[INAH]] has set up shaded areas to prevent further degradation of this pigment by the sun.  Also notable at the base of the largest pyramid is a large stone slab called a stela with a Mayan hieroglyphic inscription.  Chacchoben is one of the more popular ruin sites in southern [[Quintana Roo]], with regular tourist trips from the port of [[Costa Maya]].

The surrounding jungle is characterized by abundant species of fauna such as, [[deer]], [[peccary]], [[armadillo]], [[gray fox]], [[spider monkey]] and [[howler monkey]].  Deeper into the jungle, more dangerous animals like [[jaguar]], [[ocelot]], [[Cougar|puma]] and [[tapir]] can be found.

The '''conservation and restoration of textiles''' refers to the processes by which [[textile]]s are cared for and maintained to be [[preservation (library and archival science)|preserved]] from future damage.  The field falls under the category of [[art conservation]] as well as [[Preservation (library and archival science)|library preservation]], depending on the type of collection.  In this case, the concept of textile preservation applies to a wide range of artifacts, including [[tapestry|tapestries]], [[carpet]]s, [[quilt]]s, [[clothing]], [[flag]]s and [[curtain]]s, as well as objects which ‘’contain’’ textiles, such as upholstered [[furniture]], dolls, and accessories such as fans, [[umbrella|parasols]], [[glove]]s and [[hat]]s or [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnets]].  Many of these artifacts require specialized care, often by a professional conservator.  The goal of this article is to provide a general overview of the textile preservation process, and to serve as a jumping-off point for further research into more specialized care.  Always contact a professional conservator if you are unsure of how to proceed in the preservation process.

==Collections==
Historic textile collections can largely be divided into three categories:  [[museum]]s, historic societies/locations, and [[private collection]]s.  The needs of each of these locations will vary.  A private collection, for instance, is less likely to have as high a traffic flow as a museum, and may thus be able to take preservation steps that a working museum cannot (such as keeping lights to a minimum for longer periods of time).  The different venues may also have different problems that arise, such as the fact that many historic homes do not have climate control, and rely strongly on natural light to display their furnishings, both of which may contribute to textile decay.

==Environment==

The chief cause for decay in textiles is almost always the environment in which they are stored.  Light, temperature, and humidity can all contribute to a textile’s health or deterioration, depending on their intensity.  Additionally, pests, chemicals, and pollutants may also cause damage to an antique fabric.  Airborne chemicals, such as smog or cigarette smoke are also harmful to the textiles, and should be avoided if at all possible:  high-efficiency air filters should be installed throughout the building to reduce the presence of airborne chemicals that may stain, discolor, or weaken fabrics.

===Light===
[[Light]] can have a variety of effects on textiles over time.  In some cases, it may contribute to fading or discoloration, but of more concern is the damage which the fibers may suffer under prolonged exposure to non-visible light, such as [[ultraviolet]] and [[infrared]] lighting.  Ideally, textiles should be stored or displayed in as little light as possible, and preferably in total darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 26&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as this is impractical for display and care of the piece, knowing the limits of lighting as well as the safest amounts of lighting, become important.

[[Sunlight|Natural light]] is the most common source of ultraviolet light, and as such, care should be taken to avoid exposure to direct sunlight at all costs, and indirect sunlight whenever possible.  This may mean storing or displaying textiles in an area without windows, or with blackout curtains, which can be pulled whenever the room is not in use.  If a room relies on natural light, UV screens or coatings can be applied to the windows to block harmful rays while still allowing light to pass through.  These filters should be checked periodically, however, as they have a limited lifespan and may need to be replaced every few years.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fluorescence|Fluorescent]] and halogen-produced light can also produce large amounts of UV radiation, though filters which fit over the bulbs are available to limit the damaging light.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand and Alig 21&lt;/ref&gt; These filters will need to be replaced when the bulbs are changed, so maintenance staff should be aware of them and their use.

One advantage of fluorescent lights is that they produce little [[heat]], which may also be harmful to textiles.  [[Incandescent light bulb|Incandescent lights]] produce a large amount of heat in addition to large quantities of infrared radiation, which is likewise damaging to the fibers in antique textiles.  If incandescent lights must be used, they should be placed far enough away from display cases that their heat does not affect the contents.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand and Alig 21-22&lt;/ref&gt;  	

In the case of particularly delicate textiles, display organizers might consider [[motion detection|motion-activated]] or timed lighting, or lighting controlled though a visitor-activated switch, which would allow the textiles to remain in darkness when they are not under view.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand and Alig 23&lt;/ref&gt;  All textiles should be displayed on a rotating schedule, allowing them a few months of display, then the rest of the year in dark storage, to prolong their life.

===Climate===

[[Image:Embroidery Victorian Altar Frontal Berkshire.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Damaged [[embroidery|embroidered]] [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[altar frontal]], [[Berkshire]], [[England]].]]
Heat and [[humidity]] can both contribute and a textile’s deterioration.  However, excessive dryness may also cause damage, especially to elastic fibers, such as [[wool]], which rely on some amount of [[moisture]] to maintain their flexibility (Putnam and Finch).  Additionally, [[temperature]] and humidity should be kept as constant as possible; changes in either of these may cause the textile fibers to expand and contract, which, over time, can also cause damage and deterioration to the textile.  For this reason, both storage and display areas should be fitted with [[hygrometer|monitoring equipment]] to gauge the temperature and humidity of rooms, display cases, enclosed storage facilities, and work areas.

Ideally, temperature should be kept around 70 degrees [[Fahrenheit]],&lt;ref name="Fahey"&gt;Fahey&lt;/ref&gt; though some slight fluctuation in either direction is permissible, as long as it occurs gradually.&lt;ref name="Mailand 6"&gt;Mailand 6&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, temperature may be slightly lower in winter to save energy costs, but the change should be effected slowly, so as not to place the fibers under undue stress.

As for humidity, the preservationist or conservator should aim for a relative humidity of 50%, though, as with temperature, some small fluctuation is allowable, as long as it occurs gradually (Mailand).  In enclosed display or storage cases, humidity can be somewhat maintained through the use of [[silica gel]] crystals.  These crystals should not be placed in contact with the textiles, but may be placed in breathable muslin bags and hung inside the case to maintain a constant humidity;&lt;ref name="Mailand 6"/&gt; they should be monitored periodically, however, to be sure that they are working.

In areas where [[HVAC|climate control]] is unavailable (such as in historic buildings), the conservator can still moderate the temperature and relative humidity through use of fans, [[humidifiers]] and [[dehumidifiers]], and portable heating or cooling units.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to temperature and humidity, air flow is also a concern for textile preservation.  Textiles should never be sealed in plastic or other air-tight casing unless it is part of a treatment or cleaning process.  Proper circulation, combined with the suggested humidity, will help to prevent the growth of [[mold]] and [[mildew]], which may [[stain]] or weaken antique textiles.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pests===

Pests are another significant threat to textile collections, as there are a number of creatures which can cause damage to fibres.  Among the most common are [[tineidae|clothes moths]], [[dermestidae|carpet beetles]], [[silverfish]], [[firebrat]]s and rodents.

Clothes moths are attracted to [[protein]] fibres, and so are especially drawn to [[silk]], wool, and [[feather]]s.  An infestation might be identified through the evidence of white [[Pupa#Cocoon|cocoon]]s (or the remnants thereof) on the textiles, or of sighting the insects themselves.  They are roughly 8 centimetres long and white in colour.&lt;ref name="Fahey"/&gt;

Like clothes moths, carpet beetles are likewise drawn to proteins, and can be quite destructive.  Evidence of an infestation may take of the form of chewed holes, carcasses, or larvae, which appear as small pale worm-like insects.&lt;ref name="Fahey"/&gt;

Silverfish and firebrats are related insects which consume [[starch]], usually found in [[Sizing#Textile warp sizing|sizing]] or other treatments applied to fabrics, as well as plant-based textiles such as [[linen]] and [[cotton]].  Both are attracted to dark, moist climates, though silverfish prefer cooler temperatures, while firebrats tend towards warmer.  Both are about 12 millimetres in length and either light or dark in colouring, depending on which type is present.&lt;ref name="Fahey"/&gt;

Rodent infestations can be identified in the usual ways, such as seeing droppings, nests, or comparatively large chewed areas of textile where they have caused damage.
	
In all cases, [[chemical]] means of [[pest control]] should be avoided if possible, not only due to harm to humans who come in contact with them, but because the chemicals may cause damage to the very textiles the conservator is trying to save.  For rodents, [[mousetrap|snap traps]] may be effective, and if needed, a professional [[Pest control|exterminator]] should be called.  Poison baited traps should be avoided, as the rodent could die somewhere inaccessible, and provide a breeding ground for further pests.&lt;ref name="Mailand and Alig 27"&gt;Mailand and Alig 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, in the case of a rodent infestation, all access points to the room (such as cracks or holes) through which they might be entering should be located and sealed if possible.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand 11&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[insect]]s, keeping clean storage, display, and work environment is the best method of prevention.  Also, sticky [[insect trap|traps]] (replaced often) around doors, windows, and display cases may be useful for monitoring the insect population.  Furthermore, the population of carnivorous insects, such as [[spider]]s, should be observed.  While such insects are not harmful to textiles by themselves, they may indicate another population of insects which are.&lt;ref name="Mailand and Alig 27"/&gt;

If the infestation can be limited to one or a few pieces, the insects may be killed through [[freezing]] of the object.  The textile should be wrapped in plastic and [[vacuum packing|vacuum-sealed]], then brought to a freezing temperature as quickly as possible, to prevent the insects from adjusting to the cold.  The object may be left frozen for several days, but should be brought slowly back up to room temperature to avoid further damage.&lt;ref name="Fahey"/&gt;  Note that while this method should kill adults, it may not destroy any eggs that are present.

If chemical means must be employed, it would be best to consult with a 	professional conservator to be certain that the treatment will not harm the textiles themselves.

Even if no signs of an infestation are present, textiles should still be inspected periodically to be certain that there is no outbreak that has gone unobserved.  Additionally, when dealing with a new acquisition which shows signs of insect damage, the specimen should be [[quarantine]]d until it can be determined whether the insects are still present before introducing it to the rest of the collection.

==Textile instability==
In some cases, the textiles are weakened not by outside causes such as light or pests, but by [[chemical reaction]]s taking place within the fabric itself, such as the [[redox|oxidation]] of iron-based [[mordant]]s over time, which can cause darkening and discolouration in the surrounding fibres.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 18&lt;/ref&gt;

One example which is cited frequently throughout the literature is the case of “shattered silk.”  During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many silk manufacturers treated their fabrics with [[metal]]lic salts (usually containing [[tin]] and [[iron]]) to give them a heavier, more luxurious feel.  However, as these fabrics have aged, the metals in the fibres have accelerated their decay and caused them to become extremely [[brittleness|brittle]].  The shredded or “shattered” effect this causes is the reason for the name.  In this case, the environment of the textile contributes very little to the deterioration from the metallic salts, though exposure to light may accelerate it even further.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 19"&gt;Putnam and Finch 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Textile preservationists should be familiar with their collections and the history and [[provenance]] of their pieces.  Chemical tests can reveal the types of dyes and mordants used, as well as any other treatments applied to the fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Schweppe 153&lt;/ref&gt;  Such knowledge can lead to the prevention of further decay by learning which pieces need to be handled with particular care.

==Handling==

It goes without saying that fragile and/or valuable textiles should be handled with care, and as little as necessary in any given circumstance.  However, should handling be necessary, there are precautions &lt;ref&gt;Taken from Fahey&lt;/ref&gt; which can be taken to ensure the safety of the textile.

Because our hands contain [[oil]]s and [[acid]]s in the [[skin]], clean cloth gloves should be worn when handling textiles.  If gloves are unavailable, then frequent hand-washing should be undertaken to ensure that no damage is caused.  For similar reasons, the working, display, and storage areas should be free of food, drink, and cigarette smoke, which can also stain or damage the fabric.  Finally, to avoid ink stains, only pencils should be used for writing or sketching in the work space.

To avoid snags and pulls, remove any jewelry that may catch in the fabric’s weave, and wear clothing free of large buckles or other objects which may snag the textile.  Long hair should also be tied back to allow a clear view of the working area, even when the head is bent over the table.

When working with the textiles, it should be placed on a clean, flat surface which is larger than the textile itself, so that the whole piece is supported evenly.  Although it is supported, never place anything on top of the textile while it is in the flat position.

When moving the textile, it is important to maintain the flat, even support of the work space.  If the piece is small enough (a [[handkerchief]] or [[sampler (needlework)|sampler]], for instance), it may be placed on an [[acid-free paper|acid-free board]] or similar support and carried as if on a tray.  If the piece is too large for this (a carpet or tapestry, for example), the piece may be rolled around an acid-free tube and carried by two people to its new location.
 
Finally, antique [[costume]]s and clothing should never be worn, as the mere process of putting the clothes on and taking them off will cause damage.   Additionally, the model may not fit the costume precisely&amp;nbsp;– clothing was for a long time made to fit a specific person, not mass-produced in approximate sizes&amp;nbsp;– causing strain where there should be none and slack where there likewise should be none.

==Cleaning==

===Vacuuming===

One of the safest and easiest ways to clean textiles is to [[vacuum cleaner|vacuum]] them.  The fabric is placed on a clean, flat work surface.  If the specimen is particularly delicate, or simply as a precaution, a [[fibreglass]] [[window screen|screen]] edged with [[twill tape]] may be placed over the textile.  The screen allows dirt and [[dust]] to pass through, but prevents individual threads from being pulled loose or unravelled further by the suction.  Using a vacuum attachment and the lowest power setting, move the suction over the screen until the entire area has been cleaned.  If needed, move the screen to a new area and begin again.  Always remember to vacuum both sides of the textile, as dirt may filter through to the other side.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 48"&gt;Putnam and Finch 48&lt;/ref&gt;  Hanging textiles will need to be vacuumed less often than horizontal pieces, as there are fewer places where dust can collect.

===Wet cleaning===

One of the key standards of preservation is that of reversibility:  anything done to preserve a piece should be able to be undone with minimal damage to the piece itself.  Because wet cleaning is a chemical process, it is not reversible, and so should be used only when absolutely necessary.

Before cleaning a textile, certain questions&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Rice, page 32&lt;/ref&gt; should be asked to determine both the best treatment for that particular combination of textile and soil, and to ascertain whether the piece is able to be cleaned, or may sustain damage during the process.

'''What is the chemical composition of the textile?'''  In other words, does it have a high acid content?  Were there chemicals used in its production that might contribute to how it reacts to water?  Or how it may react to cleaning chemicals?

'''What are the characteristics of the fibres?'''  For instance, cotton and linen, being [[fibre crop|plant fibers]], are both stronger wet than dry, and so may be able to withstand a more mechanical stress than something like silk.  Wool can absorb large amounts of water, but mats if washed in high temperatures.  All silks become brittle with age, but weighted silks (see Textile Instability above) decay more quickly, and thus must be handled with extreme care.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 19"/&gt;  Additionally, some silks, once wet, can be permanently spotted.  Learn the basic characteristics of the type of fibres you have, and how they have been treated before undertaking any kind of cleaning.

'''What [[colourant]]s have been used, and how will they react to cleaning?'''  This can apply not only to [[dye]]s but to mordants as well.  Different parts of the world may have different dye processes, so here is where knowledge of when and where a textile originated, as well as a working knowledge of [[chemistry]], can come in handy.  If in doubt as to the wash ability of a dye, apply a drop or two of water to an inconspicuous place and blot with a clean white cloth.  If the dye transfers to the cloth, even in small amounts, the textile should not be washed.&lt;ref name="Mailand 8"&gt;Mailand 8&lt;/ref&gt;
 
'''Are there finishes or surface treatments that must be preserved?'''  For example, is the fabric [[paint]]ed?  If so, it should never be washed; some other cleaning method should be used.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 47"&gt;Putnam and Finch 47&lt;/ref&gt;

'''What kinds of soils are there?'''  The older the stain, the more difficult it is to remove.  After a certain point, it may be best to leave the stain or soil, or remove it only partially, in order to preserve the rest of the piece.  Additionally, soils which may not be detectable to the naked eye might be present in the textile; flags, for instance, may be highly acidic due to long exposure to [[air pollution|air pollutants]], and should be treated by a professional conservator.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 47"/&gt;

'''What cleaner is safest and most effective?'''  Commercial [[detergent]]s should never be used on [[antique]] textiles, whatever their claims of gentleness:  the chemicals used in most clothes detergents are too harsh for old fibres to withstand.  A wide range of speciality detergents are available from conservation suppliers, though most sources suggest [[Ivory (soap)|Ivory dish soap]] as a last-minute substitution if needed.  Never use chemical spot cleaners, as they are likewise too harsh for old fibres to tolerate.  This is especially important for pieces [[in situ]], as this may endanger other nearby pieces as well (the wooden part of an upholstered piece of furniture, for instance).&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 45&lt;/ref&gt;

'''What additives and cleaning aids are needed?'''  This can include physical supplies ([[water]], screens, a vacuum cleaner), as well as chemical ([[water softening|water softener]], cleaning agents, etc.).

'''How long can the specimen be exposed to the cleaner?'''  Prolonged exposure may cause additional damage to the fibres.

'''What mechanical action can be used?'''  The older and more fragile a textile, the less movement it will be able to tolerate during the cleaning process, so this should be considered before undertaking a cleaning.

Once the best cleaning process has been determined, the piece should be prepared for [[washing]].  Usually, this involves vacuuming to remove any surface dirt.  [[Lining (sewing)|Linings]] and backing should also be removed, vacuumed, and washed separately.  This is not only to prevent colour bleeding, but to avoid trapping dirt between the layers, which may cause discolouration from the inside.  Additionally, different fibres react to cleaning in different ways, and fabrics may shrink or stretch, which, if they are still attached together, may cause rippling and [[distortion]] in the lining and outer layer of the textile.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 48"/&gt;

As with moving or working with dry pieces, the textile should be washed in a flat, fully supported position.  Usually this is achieved through the use of screens like the ones used in vacuuming, though these may be supported in a frame of some kind for added stability.  The textile should be sandwiched between two screens.  If the piece is particularly delicate or fragile, it may be wrapped in [[net (textile)|netting]], then placed between the screens.&lt;ref name="Putnam and Finch 48"/&gt;  	

The cleaning [[solution]] should be prepared using [[distilled water]].  If that is unavailable, softened water may be substituted.  The main concern is to avoid [[hard water]], which will leave deposits of [[mineral]]s in the fibres.&lt;ref name="Mailand 8"/&gt;  The solution should be placed in a container large enough for the textile to lie flat in.  For large pieces, it may be necessary to construct a temporary basin outside or in a large room:  Putnam and Finch suggest using boards or bricks to constrict a frame, then lining it with a large piece of [[plastic]], weighted on the sides, and strong enough to support the water that will be poured into it.  If a smaller basin is used, it should be of [[ceramic]], [[stainless steel]] or a stable plastic.

The screen-encased textile is lowered into the solution.  The textile can then be washed by pressing a soft [[sponge]] directly down onto the fibres.  DO NOT RUB the sponge, as this will cause unnecessary [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] at a moment when the textile is already weak from the water.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 50&lt;/ref&gt;  The textile may be submerged for no more than an hour, and should be rinsed at least four times after it is cleaned (Mailand).  The final rinse should always be with distilled water.  The textile should be placed to dry on a flat surface or screen, in a well-ventilated room away from heat.

===Dry cleaning===

[[Dry cleaning]] is generally only used for oil stains, as it is a very stressful process of the textile.  Commercial dry cleaners should never be used, as the chemicals used in the process are too strong for old fabrics to withstand without damage.  If dry cleaning is absolutely necessary, consult a professional conservator.&lt;ref name="Mailand 9"&gt;Mailand 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steaming and ironing===

[[Steam]]ing and [[ironing]] textiles should be done with caution, as the heat may affect the viability of the fibres.  More importantly, the fabric should always be cleaned before either of these processes is used, since heat may trap dirt and stains in the fibres to such an extent that the stain becomes permanent.  Always use the lowest setting for either of these procedures.&lt;ref name="Mailand 9"/&gt;  If a garment relies on folds to maintain its proper shape (such as [[pleat]]s), it may be better to finger-press the folds into place when the garment is damp and allow it to dry that way, rather than subject it to the added stress of ironing.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;

===One alternative to ironing===

If a textile item is relatively thin and light, and is safe to wet, it can be laid out flat on a piece of glass which is larger than the item.  Before each use, the glass surface should be cleaned with 'safe' cleaners, as for the textile itself (see 'Wet Cleaning,' above), even if the glass has been kept in a clean place.  The last rinse of the glass should ideally be with a very clean cotton cloth and distilled water.

Lay the textile out as flat as possible on the dry glass.  Do not let the textile touch any metal or other casing that protects the edge of the glass.  Old storm-windowpanes and glass shower doors are often used for this task, and they usually have their original edging left on, if it's not too bulky, for reasons of safety in handling.  If the textile is known to be clean, it can be laid out dry and gently wetted to full saturation.  As sections are wetted, any crumples, folds, or details (such as fringes, the picots on the edges of lace, or fine pleats) can be gently teased into place with clean fingertips so that they lie as flat as possible on the glass.

Some old textiles can be flattened on glass just after washing, though it may be best to transfer to the glass fully supported, as on a netting screen or similar.  The supporting fabric can be removed by rolling it out from under the textile item as it is laid out on the glass, bit by bit.  Just be aware that this can stress the fibres:  do not use this method on any old textile that is likely to be damaged by the handling.  Let such fabrics dry first, then lay them on the glass and wet them in place.

Let dry completely in a darkened place with good air-flow.  The textile can be gently lifted from the glass when it's completely dry, and will usually look just as smooth as if a hot iron had been used on it.

==Restoration==
Restoration can be done with techniques like [[Clothing#Mending|mending]] and [[darning]].&lt;ref name=darn1&gt;[https://www.deccanherald.com/content/325696/rafoogari-art-darning.html Rafoogari: Art of darning], [[Deccan herald]], 13 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=darn2&gt;[https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/8LxZYCbNJemRy3h1DwQGYN/New-Delhi-Mapping-a-forgotten-tradition.html New Delhi: Mapping a forgotten tradition], [[LiveMint]], 28 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=darn3&gt;[https://www.thestatesman.com/features/journey-of-a-shawl-1502624308.html Journey of a shawl ], The Statesman, 19 April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=darn4&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/art/The-fabric-of-hope/article14588954.ece The fabric of hope], [[The Hindu]], 25 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage==

As stated in the Climate section, the best storage environment for textiles is clean, dark, cool, and moderately dry, with a constant temperature and relative humidity.  Ideally, there should be no strain on any one particular area of cloth.  There are three basic kinds of storage for textiles, and the choice of which to use relies on the type of textile and the space available.  The three types are:  Flat, Rolled, and Hanging storage.

===Flat storage===

Flat storage is the best option for exceptionally fragile pieces because it provides the most even support for the fibres.  Enamelled metal shelves or drawers may be used, or acid-free boxes.  The textiles may be placed in the boxes or drawers flat, if at all possible.  If folding becomes necessary, acid-free [[tissue paper]] should be used to form soft rolls around which the folds can be shaped, to prevent creases from forming.  Even so, folded textiles should be removed and refolded differently every few months, to allow even wear on the piece.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rolled storage===

For exceptionally large textiles, such as tapestries, draperies, carpets and quilts, rolled storage is the best option.  Like the upholstery section of a fabric store, the rolled storage area should consist of racks, each containing horizontally suspended acid-free or fabric-covered tubes around which the fabrics can be wrapped, being sure to line the [[selvage]]s up with the edges of the roll.  Textiles with a decorative side (such as [[velvet]]s and [[embroidery|embroidered]] textiles) should always be rolled with the decorative side facing out.  This is because the inner layer, especially if there is a lining, may crease, stretch, or fold while it is on the roll.  The rolled textiles can then be covered with a [[muslin]] wrapper to protect it from dust.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand and Alig 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hanging costume storage===

For costumes, flat storage may create more problems than it solves, since it is impossible to store them in this manner without forming folds and creases.  Therefore, unless the costume is so weakened that it cannot support its own weight, hanging storage is perhaps the best option.  Costumes which are unusually heavy (heavily [[bead]]ed [[gown]]s, for instance), or those whose fabric may distort easily (such as some [[stretch fabric]]s, or those cut on the bias) should also be stored in flat storage.  Garments suitable for hanging should be placed on plastic hangers which have been padded to mimic the shape of human shoulders, and covered with a plastic or cloth cover with an open bottom to allow air circulation while keeping the costume clean.&lt;ref name="Fahey"/&gt;  Wooden hangers may have a high acid content, which may cause discolouration or decay to the costume.  Likewise, metal hangers do not provide sufficient support, and may lead to distortion of the garments’ shoulders.  Therefore, both forms of hanging should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Mailand and Alig 44&lt;/ref&gt;

If sufficient space is available, selected garments may be stored on [[mannequin|dummies]] to better keep their shape.  If this method is used, dummies should be fitted out with the proper [[undergarment]]s, such as [[bustle]]s or [[pannier (clothing)|panniers]], to provide adequate support for the garments as they were intended to be worn.  However, while the main concern of a display may be to make the garment look attractive on the dummy, storage need have no such considerations.  Loose, unsupported parts of the garment (such as sleeves or shirts) should be loosely stuffed with acid-free tissue paper to provide additional support.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

Costume [[fashion accessory|accessories]] can be stored in a variety of ways.  Generally, bonnets and gloves should be loosely stuffed with acid-free tissue and placed in archival-quality boxes or under cover.  Fans and parasols may be stored in half-open positions, which provide the least amount of stress on the fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam and Finch 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display==

The conditions required for display of textiles are largely those that have already been discussed in the Storage and Environment sections.  Dry, cool, and dark, are to be preferred, with clean surroundings and frequent checks to be certain that the textiles are remaining in good condition.  Lighting should be kept to a minimum, and textiles should be rotated through display, so that each is only exposed to light for a few months at a time before being returned to darkness or taken for cleaning/conservation work.  Textiles should be vacuumed before and after display.

== Education and training ==
In France, conservators specialized in textiles arts are trained at the [[Institut national du patrimoine|Institut National du Patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration.

{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2014}}

Popularized by the American sociologist [[Barry Glassner]], '''culture of fear''' (or '''climate of fear''') is the concept that people may incite [[fear]] in the general public to achieve political or workplace goals through [[emotional bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klaehn|first=Jeffery|title=Filtering the news: essays on Herman and [[Chomsky]]'s propaganda model|year=2005|publisher=[[Black Rose Books]]|pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A largely unrelated concept in sociology is the "fear culture" on the [[Guilt-Shame-Fear spectrum of cultures]].

==In the workplace==
{{Main article|Organizational culture|Toxic workplace|Workplace bullying}}
Ashforth discussed potentially destructive sides of [[leadership]] and identified what he referred to as [[petty tyrants]]: leaders who exercise a tyrannical style of management, resulting in a climate of fear in the workplace.&lt;ref name=ashforth&gt;''Petty tyranny in organizations'', Ashforth, Blake, Human Relations, Vol. 47, No. 7, 755–778 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;  Partial or intermittent [[negative reinforcement]] can create an effective climate of fear and [[doubt]].&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; When employees get the sense that bullies are tolerated, a climate of fear may be the result.&lt;ref name=Organisational&gt;Helge H, Sheehan MJ, Cooper CL, Einarsen S "Organisational Effects of Workplace Bullying" in Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Several studies have confirmed a relationship between bullying, on one hand, and an autocratic leadership and an authoritarian way of settling [[workplace conflict|conflicts]] or dealing with disagreements, on the other.  An [[Authoritarian leadership style|authoritarian style of leadership]] may create a climate of fear, with little or no room for dialogue and with complaining being considered futile.&lt;ref&gt;Salin D, Helge H "Organizational Causes of Workplace Bullying"  in 
Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace: Developments in Theory, Research, and Practice (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of [[public-sector union]] members, approximately one in five workers reported having considered [[turnover (employment)|leaving]] the workplace as a result of witnessing bullying taking place.  Rayner explained the figures by pointing to the presence of a climate of fear in which employees considered reporting to be unsafe, where bullies had been tolerated previously despite management knowing of the presence of bullying.&lt;ref name=Organisational/&gt;

Individual differences in sensitivity to [[Reward system|reward]], [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] and [[motivation]] have been studied under the premises of [[reinforcement sensitivity theory]] and have also been [[Reinforcement sensitivity theory#Workplace performance|applied to workplace performance]].

A culture of fear at the workplace runs contrary to the "key principles" established by [[W. Edwards Deming]] for managers to transform business effectiveness.  One of his [[W. Edwards Deming#Key principles|fourteen principles]] is to drive out fear in order to allow everyone to work effectively for the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deming.org/explore/fourteen-points|title=The W. Edwards Deming Institute|last=Acquate|website=deming.org|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
{{main article|Fear mongering|fascism}}
Nazi leader [[Hermann Göring]] explains how people can be made fearful and to support a war they otherwise would oppose:

{{quote|The people don't want [[war]], but they can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.  This is easy.  All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and [[denunciation|denounce]] the pacifists for lack of patriotism and for exposing the country to danger.  It works the same in every country.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave Gilbert]] (1947) ''[[Nuremberg Diary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In her book "State and Opposition in Military Brazil," Maria Helena Moreira Alves found a "culture of fear" was implemented as part of [[History of Brazil (1964–1985)|political repression since 1964]].  She used the term to describe methods implemented by the [[national security]] apparatus of Brazil in its effort to equate political participation with risk of [[arrest]] and [[torture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alves|first1=Maria|title=State and Opposition in Military Brazil|date=1985|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Brazil|page=352|accessdate=14 June 2015|ref=Alves}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassação (English: cassation) is one such mechanism used to punish members of the military by legally declaring them dead.  This enhanced the potential for political control through intensifying the culture of fear as a deterrent to opposition.&lt;ref name=Alves1&gt;{{cite book|title=State and Opposition in Military Brazil|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alves found the changes of the [[National Security Law (Brazil)|National Security Law]] of 1969, as beginning the use of "[[economic exploitation]], physical [[political repression|repression]], political control, and strict [[censorship]]" to establish a "culture of fear" in Brazil.&lt;ref name=Alves2&gt;{{cite book|title=State and Opposition in Military Brazil|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three psychological components of the culture of fear included silence through censorship, sense of isolation, and a "generalized belief that all channels of opposition were closed."  A "feeling of complete [[hopelessness]]," prevailed, in addition to  "withdrawal from opposition activity."&lt;ref name=Alves3&gt;{{cite book|title=State and Opposition in Military Brazil|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former US National Security Advisor [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] argues that the use of the term [[War on Terror]] was intended to generate a culture of fear deliberately because it "obscures reason, intensifies emotions and makes it easier for [[demagogic]] politicians to mobilize the public on behalf of the policies they want to pursue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/23/AR2007032301613.html |title=Terrorized by 'War on Terror' by Brzezinski |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= March 25, 2007|accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsDecC12&gt;{{cite news

[[Frank Furedi]], a former professor of Sociology and writer for ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'' magazine, says that today's culture of fear did not begin with the collapse of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].  Long before September 11, he argues, public [[panic]]s were widespread – on everything from [[GM crops]] to mobile phones, from [[global warming]] to [[foot-and-mouth disease]].  Like Durodié, Furedi argues that perceptions of risk, ideas about safety and controversies over health, the environment and technology have little to do with science or [[empirical evidence]].  Rather, they are shaped by cultural assumptions about human [[vulnerability]].  Furedi say that "we need a grown-up discussion about our post-September 11 world, based on a reasoned evaluation of all the available evidence rather than on [[irrational]] fears for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frank Furedi |url=http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/00000002D46C.htm |title=Epidemic of fear |publisher=Spiked-online.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British academics Gabe Mythen and Sandra Walklate argue that following terrorist attacks in New York, the Pentagon, Madrid, and London, government agencies developed a discourse of "new terrorism" in a cultural climate of [[fear, uncertainty and doubt|fear and uncertainty]].  UK researchers argued that these processes reduced notions of [[public safety]] and created the [[simplistic]] image of a non-white "terroristic other" that has negative consequences for ethnic minority groups in the UK.&lt;ref name="Gabe Mythen1 and Sandra Walklate"&gt;[http://cmc.sagepub.com/content/2/2/123.abstract#aff-1 Communicating the terrorist risk: Harnessing a culture of fear?] Gabe Mythen [[Manchester Metropolitan University]], UK, Sandra Walklate [[University of Liverpool]], UK&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2004 BBC documentary film series, ''[[The Power of Nightmares]]'', subtitled ''The Rise of the Politics of Fear'', the journalist [[Adam Curtis]] argues that politicians have used our fears to increase their power and control over society.  Though he does not use the term "culture of fear," what Curtis describes in his film is a reflection of this concept.  He looks at the American [[neo-conservative]] movement and its depiction of the [[threat]] first from the [[Soviet Union]] and then from radical [[Islamist]]s.&lt;ref name="bbcpower"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Power of Nightmares: Your comments |newspaper=[[BBC]] |location=London |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/4016713.stm |date=August 3, 2005 |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis insists there has been a largely illusory fear of terrorism in the west since the [[September 11 attacks]] and that politicians such as [[George W Bush]] and [[Tony Blair]] had stumbled on a new force to restore their power and authority; using the fear of an organised "web of evil" from which they could protect their people.&lt;ref name="guardcanned"&gt;{{cite news |title=The film US TV networks dare not show |first=Stuart |last=Jeffries |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/may/12/cannes2005.cannesfilmfestival4 |date=May 12, 2005 |accessdate=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Curtis's film castigated the media, security forces and the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] for expanding their power in this way.&lt;ref name="guardcanned"/&gt; The film features [[Bill Durodié]], then Director of the International Centre for Security Analysis, and Senior [[Research Fellow]] in the International Policy Institute, [[King's College London]], saying that to call this network an "invention" would be too strong a term, but he asserts that it probably does not exist and is largely a "([[psychological projection|projection]]) of our own worst fears, and that what we see is a fantasy that's been created."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daanspeak.com/TranscriptPowerOfNightmares3.html|title=Exploring The Best Pro hormone Stacks|website=www.daanspeak.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact of the media  ==
The consumption of mass media has had a profound effect on instilling the fear of terrorism in the United States, though acts of terror are a rare phenomenon.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nellis|first=Ashley Marie|last2=Savage|first2=Joanne|date=2012-09-10|title=Does Watching the News Affect Fear of Terrorism?

According to Gerbner, television and other forms of mass media create a worldview that is reflective of “recurrent media messages”, rather than one that is based on reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Callanan|first=Valerie J.|date=2012-03-01|title=Media Consumption, Perceptions of Crime Risk and Fear of Crime: Examining Race/Ethnic Differences|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1525/sop.2012.55.1.93|journal=Sociological Perspectives|language=en|volume=55|issue=1|pages=93–115|doi=10.1525/sop.2012.55.1.93}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Americans are exposed to some form of media on a daily basis, with television and social media platforms being the most used methods to receive both local and international news, and as such this is how most receive news and details that center around violent crime and acts of terror.  With the rise in use of smartphones and social media, people are bombarded with constant news updates, and able to read stories related to terrorism, stories that come from all corners of the globe.  Media fuels fear of terrorism and other threats to national security, all of which have negative psychological effects on the population, such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  Politicians conduct interviews, televised or otherwise, and utilize their social media platforms immediately after violent crimes and terrorist acts, to further cement the fear of terrorism into the minds of their constituents.

{{medical citations needed|date=March 2015}}
The '''DASH diet''' ('''Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension''') is a dietary pattern promoted by the [[United States|U.S.]]-based [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] (part of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), an agency of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]) to prevent and control [[hypertension]]. The DASH diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy foods; includes meat, fish, poultry, nuts, and beans; and is limited in sugar-sweetened foods and beverages, red meat, and added fats. In addition to its effect on blood pressure, it is designed to be a well-balanced approach to eating for the general public. DASH is recommended by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) as one of its ideal eating plans for all Americans.&lt;ref&gt;The USDA recommends the USDA Food Patterns including their vegetarian and vegan adaptations, the Mediterranean, and the DASH Eating Plan, in {{cite web|website=health.gov|author=U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|title=2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans|year=2010|edition=Chapter 5 in 7|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|url=http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/dga2010/DietaryGuidelines2010.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DASH diet is based on NIH studies that examined three dietary plans and their results. None of the plans were [[vegetarian]], but the DASH plan incorporated more fruits and vegetables, low fat or nonfat dairy, beans, and nuts than the others studied. The DASH diet reduced [[systolic blood pressure]] by 6 [[Torr|mm Hg]] and [[diastolic blood pressure]] by 3&amp;nbsp;mm Hg in patients with high normal blood pressure (formerly called "pre-hypertension"). Those with hypertension dropped by 11 and 6&amp;nbsp;mm Hg, respectively. These changes in blood pressure occurred with no changes in body weight. The DASH dietary pattern is adjusted based on daily caloric intake ranging from 1,600 to 3,100 dietary [[calorie]]s.&lt;ref name="dashguide"&gt;"&gt;{{cite web   | title = Your Guide To Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASH | publisher = [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]   | date = April 2006 | url = https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/public/heart/new_dash.pdf | website=nhlbi.nih.gov|format = PDF | accessdate = 2011-12-28 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180723030311/https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/public/heart/new_dash.pdf | archivedate = 2018-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DASH diet was further tested and developed in the Optimal Macronutrient Intake Trial for Heart Health ([[OmniHeart diet]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Appel|first1=LJ|title=Effects of protein, monounsaturated fat, and carbohydrate intake on blood pressure and serum lipids: results of the OmniHeart randomized trial.|journal=JAMA|date=16 Nov 2005|volume=294|issue=19|pages=2455–64|pmid=16287956|doi=10.1001/jama.294.19.2455}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The DASH and DASH-sodium trials demonstrated that a carbohydrate-rich diet that emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products and that is reduced in saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol substantially lowered blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. OmniHeart demonstrated that partial replacement of carbohydrate with either protein (about half from plant sources) or with unsaturated fat (mostly monounsaturated fat) can further reduce blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and coronary heart disease risk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=ER|title=The effects of macronutrients on blood pressure and lipids: an overview of the DASH and OmniHeart trials|journal=Curr Atheroscler Rep|date=Nov 2006|volume=8|issue=6|pages=460–5|pmid=17045071|doi=10.1007/s11883-006-0020-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, DASH was named the number 1 for "Best Diets Overall", "For Healthy Eating", and "Best Heart-Healthy Diet"; and tied number 2 "For Diabetes"(out of 40 diets tested) in the ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'''s annual “Best Diets” rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/info/blogs/press-room/articles/2018-01-03/us-news-reveals-best-diets-rankings-for-2018|title=U.S. News Reveals Best Diets Rankings for 2018|last=|first=|date=|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For individuals 40–70 years of age, each increment of 20 mm Hg in systolic BP (SBP) or 10 mm Hg in diastolic BP (DBP) doubles the risk of CVD across the entire BP range from 115/75 to 185/115 mm Hg.”.&lt;ref name="Sacks 1997" /&gt;

The prevalence of hypertension led the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) to propose funding to further research the role of dietary patterns on blood pressure. In 1992 the NHLBI worked with five of the most well-respected medical research centers in different cities across the U.S. to conduct the largest and most detailed research study to date.  The DASH study used a rigorous design called a randomized controlled trial (RCT), and it involved teams of physicians, nurses, nutritionists, statisticians, and research coordinators working in a cooperative venture in which participants were selected and studied in each of these five research facilities. The chosen facilities and locales for this multi-center study were: (1) [[Johns Hopkins University]] in Baltimore, Maryland, (2) [[Duke University Medical Center]] in Durham, North Carolina, (3) [[Kaiser Permanente]] Center for Health Research in Portland, Oregon, (4) [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] in Boston, Massachusetts, and (5) [[Pennington Biomedical Research Center]] in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.&lt;ref name="dashguide"/&gt;

Two DASH trials were designed and carried out as multi-center, randomized, outpatient feeding studies with the purpose of testing the effects of dietary patterns on blood pressure. The standardized multi-center protocol is an approach used in many large-scale multi-center studies funded by the NHLBI. A unique feature of the DASH diet was that the foods and menu were chosen based on conventionally consumed food items so it could be more easily adopted by the general public if results were positive.&lt;ref name = "NEJM Appel 1997"&gt;{{cite journal

The nutritional conceptualization of the DASH meal plans was based in part on this research.&lt;ref name = "NEJM Appel 1997"/&gt;

=== Diet ===
Two experimental diets were selected for the DASH study and compared with each other, and with a third: the control diet. The control diet was low in potassium, calcium, magnesium and fiber and featured a fat and protein profile so that the pattern was consistent with a “typical American diet at the time”.&lt;ref name="dashguide" /&gt; The first experimental diet was higher in fruits and vegetables but otherwise similar to the control diet (a “fruits and vegetables diet” &lt;ref name="Moore 2001" /&gt;), with the exception of fewer snacks and sweets. Magnesium and Potassium levels were close to the 75th percentile of U.S. consumption in the fruits-and-vegetables diet, which also featured a high fiber profile. The second experimental diet was high in fruits-and-vegetables and in low-fat dairy products, as well as lower in overall fat and saturated fat, with higher fiber and higher protein compared with the control diet—this diet has been called “the DASH Diet”.&lt;ref name="JNC-Report7" /&gt; The DASH diet (or combination diet) was rich in potassium, magnesium and calcium—a nutrient profile roughly equivalent with the 75th percentile of U.S. consumption.  The combination or “DASH” diet was also high in whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts while being lower in red meat content, sweets, and sugar-containing beverages.&lt;ref name="Lewington 2002"&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DASH diet was designed to provide liberal amounts of key nutrients thought to play a part in lowering blood pressure, based on past epidemiologic studies.  One of the unique features of the DASH study was that dietary patterns rather than single nutrients were being tested.&lt;ref name = "NEJM Appel 1997"/&gt; The DASH diet also features a high quotient of anti-oxidant rich foods thought by some to retard or prevent chronic health problems including cancer, heart disease, and stroke.&lt;ref name="dashguide"/&gt;

Researchers have also found that the DASH diet is more effective than a low [[oxalate]] diet in the prevention and treatment of kidney stones, specifically calcium oxalate kidney stones (the most common type).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bellman|first1=Gary|title=DASH Diet May Lower Risk of Recurrent Kidney Stones|url=http://socalurologyinstitute.com/blog/DASH-Diet-May-Lower-Risk-of-Recurrent-Kidney-Stones.html|website=Southern California Urology Institute|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Study design ===
Participants ate one of the three aforementioned dietary patterns in 3 separate phases of the trial, including (1) Screening, (2), Run-in and (3) Intervention. In the screening phase, participants were screened for eligibility based on the combined results of blood pressure readings. In the 3 week run-in phase, each subject was given the control diet for 3 weeks, had their blood pressure measurements taken on each of five separate days, gave one 24-hour urine sample and completed a questionnaire on symptoms. At this point, subjects who were compliant with the feeding program during the screening phase were each randomly assigned to one of the three diets outlined above, to begin at the start of the 4th week. The intervention phase followed next; this was an 8-week period in which the subjects were provided the diet to which they had been randomly assigned. Blood pressures and urine samples were collected again during this time together with symptom &amp; physical activity recall questionnaires. The first group of study subjects began the run-in phase of the trial in September 1994 while the fifth and final group began in January 1996.&lt;ref name="Moore 2001" /&gt; Each of the three diets contained the same 3&amp;nbsp;grams (3,000&amp;nbsp;mg) of sodium, selected because that was the approximate average intake in the nation at the time. Participants were also given two packets of salt, each containing 200&amp;nbsp;mg of sodium, for discretionary use. Alcohol was limited to no more than two beverages per day, and caffeine intake was limited to no more than three caffeinated beverages.&lt;ref name="Lewington 2002" /&gt;

== Study results ==
The DASH trial showed that dietary patterns can and do affect blood pressure in the high normal BP to moderately hypertensive adult population (systolic &lt; 180&amp;nbsp;mm Hg &amp; diastolic of 80 to 95&amp;nbsp;mm Hg).&lt;ref name = "Moore 2001"/&gt; Respectively, the DASH  or “combination” diet lowered blood pressures by an average of 5.5 and 3.0&amp;nbsp;mm Hg for systolic and diastolic, compared with the control diet. The minority portion of the study sample and the hypertensive portion both showed the largest reductions in blood pressure from the combination diet against the control diet. The hypertensive subjects experienced a drop of 11.4&amp;nbsp;mm Hg in their systolic and 5.5&amp;nbsp;mm Hg in their diastolic phases.&lt;ref name = "Moore 2001"/&gt;  The fruits-and-vegetables diet was also successful, although it produced more modest reductions compared with the control diet (2.8&amp;nbsp;mm Hg systolic and 1.1&amp;nbsp;mm Hg diastolic).&lt;ref name="Lewington 2002"/&gt; In the subjects with and without hypertension, the combination diet effectively reduced blood pressure more than the fruits-and-vegetables diet or the control diet did. The data indicated that reductions in blood pressure occurred within two weeks of subjects’ starting their designated diets,&lt;ref name="Lewington 2002"/&gt; and that the results were generalizable to the target sample of the U.S. population.&lt;ref name = "Moore 2001"/&gt; Side effects were negligible, but the NEJM study reports that some subjects reported constipation as a problem. At the end of the intervention phase, 10.1, 5.4 &amp; 4.0 percent of the subjects reported this problem for the control, fruits-and-vegetables and combination diets, respectively, showing that the fruits and vegetables and combination diets reduce constipation. Apart from only one subject (on the control diet) who was suffering from cholecystitis, other gastrointestinal symptoms had a low rate of incidence.

== DASH-Sodium study ==

=== Design ===
The DASH-Sodium study was conducted following the end of the original DASH study to determine whether the DASH diet could produce even better results if it were low in salt and also to examine the effects of different levels of sodium in people eating the DASH diet.&lt;ref name="dashguide"/&gt; The researchers were interested in determining the effects of sodium reduction when combined with the DASH diet as well as the effects of the DASH diet when at three levels of sodium intake. The DASH-Sodium trial was conducted from September 1997 through November 1999. Like the previous study, it was based on a large sample (412 participants) and was a multi-center, randomized, outpatient feeding study where the subjects were given all their food.&lt;ref name="Karanja 2004"&gt;{{cite journal

  | accessdate = 2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants were adults with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension (average systolic of 120 to 159&amp;nbsp;mm Hg &amp; average diastolic of 80 to 95&amp;nbsp;mm Hg) and were randomly assigned to one of two diet groups.&lt;ref name="Lewington 2002"/&gt; The two randomized diet groups were the DASH diet and a control diet that mirrored a “typical American diet”, and which was somewhat low in key nutrients such as potassium, magnesium and calcium. The DASH diet was the same as in the previous DASH study. After being assigned to one of these two diets, the participants were given diets that differed by 3 distinct levels of sodium content, corresponding to 3,000&amp;nbsp;mg, 2,400&amp;nbsp;mg or 1,500&amp;nbsp;mg/day (higher, intermediate or lower), in random order, for 30 consecutive days each.&lt;ref name="Lewington 2002"/&gt; During the two-week run-in phase, all participants ate the high sodium control diet. The 30-day intervention phase followed, in which subjects ate their assigned diets at each of the aforementioned sodium levels (high, intermediate and low) in random order, in a crossover design.&lt;ref name="Karanja 2004"/&gt; During the 30-day dietary intervention phase, each participant therefore consumed his or her assigned diet (either DASH or control) at all three sodium levels.{{Dubious | date = October 2018 | reason = Each person consumed the diet at one sodium level for 30 days consecutively, and then consumed the diet at the other two levels in the next 60 days, so there were '3 intervention phases.'  Probably need to fix the wording.  See https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM200101043440101}}

=== Results and conclusions ===
The primary outcome of the DASH-Sodium study was systolic blood pressure at the end of the 30-day dietary intervention periods. The secondary outcome was diastolic blood pressure. The DASH-Sodium study found that reductions in sodium intake produced significantly lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures in both the control and DASH diets. Study results indicate that the quantity of dietary sodium in the control diet was twice as powerful in its effect on blood pressure as it was in the DASH diet. Importantly, the control diet sodium reductions from intermediate to low correlated with greater changes in systolic blood pressure than those same changes from high to intermediate (change equal to roughly 40&amp;nbsp;mmol per day, or 1&amp;nbsp;gram of sodium).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/studies/dashsodium/ | website=nhlbi.nih.gov|title = Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension - Sodium Study (DASH-Sodium) | publisher = [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stated by Sacks, F. et al., reductions in sodium intake by this amount per day correlated with greater decreases in blood pressure when the starting sodium intake level was already at the U.S. [[Dietary Reference Intake|recommended dietary allowance]], than when the starting level was higher (higher levels are the actual average in the U.S.).  These results led researchers to postulate that the adoption of a national lower daily allowance for sodium than the currently held 2,400&amp;nbsp;mg could be based on the sound scientific results provided by this study.&lt;ref name="Karanja 2004"/&gt; The U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating a diet of 2300&amp;nbsp;mg of sodium a day or lower, with a recommendation of 1500&amp;nbsp;mg/day in adults who have elevated blood pressure; the 1500&amp;nbsp;mg/day is the low sodium level tested in the DASH-Sodium study.
 
The DASH diet and the control diet at the lower salt levels were both successful in lowering blood pressure, but the largest reductions in blood pressure were obtained by eating a combination of these two (i.e., a lower-salt version of the DASH diet). The effect of this combination at a sodium level of 1,500&amp;nbsp;mg/day was an average blood pressure reduction of 8.9/4.5&amp;nbsp;mm Hg (systolic/diastolic). The hypertensive subjects experienced an average reduction of 11.5/5.7&amp;nbsp;mm Hg.&lt;ref name="Lewington 2002"/&gt; The DASH-sodium results indicate that low sodium levels correlated with the largest reductions in blood pressure for participants at both pre-hypertensive and hypertensive levels, with the hypertensive participants showing the greatest reductions in blood pressure overall.

The '''Deputy Chair of the Democratic National Committee''' is a position within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|United States Democratic Party]] that was re-established by [[Tom Perez]] in February 2017 after the [[Democratic National Committee chairmanship election, 2017|2017 DNC Chair race]], won by Perez. 

After a close victory over Minnesota Congressman [[Keith Ellison]], Perez appointed Ellison as Deputy Chair in an attempt to lessen the divide in the Democratic Party after the contentious [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 Democratic presidential primaries]], which saw conflicts between supporters of [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Bernie Sanders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bradner |first1=Eric|title=Perez wins DNC chairmanship|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/02/25/politics/dnc-chair-election/ |work=CNN |date=February 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perez was seen as being more in line with the Clinton wing, while Ellison was more in line with the Sanders wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/140847/case-tom-perez-makes-no-sense|title=The Case for Tom Perez Makes No Sense|author=Chang, Clio|newspaper=[[The New Republic]]|date=February 23, 2017|accessdate=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
The title "Dirty John" came from one of John Meehan's nicknames given to him by his classmates during his time at the [[University of Dayton]]. Other nicknames from this time included Filthy John or just Filthy. The exact nexus of these nicknames was never divulged during the podcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-dirty-john-filthy/#nt=outfit46 |title= Dirty John Part 3: Filthy - Los Angeles Times |accessdate=November 23, 2017 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Dirty John'' is a [[true crime]] story focusing on the life and exploits of John Meehan. ''[[L.A. Times]]'' journalist Christopher Goffard first heard of Meehan when he learned that the police were investigating a possible murder in [[Newport Beach]]. Upon investigating, Goffard discovered a bizarre web of deceit and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

The main focus of the story is Meehan's relationship with businesswoman Debra Newell, whom he met via an [[Online dating service|Internet dating]] site, as well as her immediate and extended family. The podcast deals with themes of abuse and manipulation, as well as the behaviours of those being abused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/13/dirty-john-your-chilling-new-true-obsession-podcasts-of-the-week |title=  Dirty John, your chilling new true crime obsession – podcasts of the week |accessdate=November 23, 2017 |language=English|newspaper=  The Guardian |date=  2017-10-13 |last1=  Verdier |first1=  Hannah |last2=  Slaney |first2=  Rowan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meehan himself was killed by Newell's youngest daughter Terra, who acted in self-defense when he tried to kill her on the rooftop parking lot of her apartment building on August 20, 2016. He was hospitalized and died on the 24th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/socal/daily-pilot/news/tn-dpt-me-stabbing-20160825-story.html|title=Man dies after being stabbed by woman he assaulted with knife, police say|first=Hannah|last=Fry|date=|website=latimes.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was covered by ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' on January 12, 2018, and included interviews with Goffard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/01/11/dateline-nbc-dirty-john-episode-clip/|title=See Terra Newell describe her showdown with 'Dirty John' Meehan in exclusive 'Dateline NBC' clip|author=|date=|website=ew.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/dateline/coercive-control-potential-factor-dirty-john-case-psychological-abuse-n837361|title=‘Coercive control’ potential factor in ‘Dirty John’ case of psychological abuse|author=|date=|website=nbcnews.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/KNTV_20180113_060000_Dateline_NBC|title=Dateline NBC : KNTV : January 12, 2018 10:00pm-11:01pm PST|author=|date=13 January 2018|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2018|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dayton.com/news/local/former-dayton-woman-talk-about-marriage-dirty-john-dateline/tvPMd3uVFi47hFe2oNa1JL/|title=Former Dayton woman to talk about marriage to ‘Dirty John’ on Dateline|author=|date=|website=dayton.com|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-3t6vI8Xwo|title=Dirty John - Christopher Goffard speaks about his story - Dirty John Podcast|first=|last=Podcasts Dirty John by Wondery|date=21 January 2018|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVqPWWoFyalOCIwjROCK8yg|title=Podcasts Dirty John by Wondery|author=|date=|website=YouTube|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Early Man''''' is a 2018 British [[stop motion|stop-motion animated]] [[historical fiction|historical]] [[sports film|sports]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Nick Park]], written by [[Mark Burton (writer)|Mark Burton]] and James Higginson, and starring the voices of [[Eddie Redmayne]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Maisie Williams]], and [[Timothy Spall]]. The film follows a tribe of primitive [[Stone Age]] valley dwellers, who have to defend their land from [[bronze]]-using invaders in an [[association football]] match. 

The film was produced by [[Aardman Animations]] and [[British Film Institute|BFI]] and was released on 26 January 2018 in the United Kingdom, and in the United States on 16 February 2018. The film received very positive reviews from critics, but it was a box office disappointment, grossing only $54 million against its $50 million budget. It currently has an 82% score on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].

==Plot==
An asteroid collides with the prehistoric Earth, causing the extinction of the planet’s [[dinosaur]]s, but sparing a tribe of [[cavemen]] living near the impact site. Finding a roughly spherical chunk of the asteroid that is too hot to touch, the cavemen begin to kick it around and invent the game of [[association football|football]].

Many years later during the [[Stone Age]], a young caveman named Dug ([[Eddie Redmayne]]) lives in the village with the chief Bobnar ([[Timothy Spall]]) and many other cavemen such as Asbo, ([[Johnny Vegas]]), Gravelle ([[Gina Yashere]]), Treebor ([[Richard Ayoade]]), Magma ([[Selina Griffiths]]), Barry ([[Mark Williams (actor)|Mark Williams]]), Grubup (Richard Webber), Thongo ([[Simon Greenall]]) and Eemak (Simon Greenall). One day, Dug suggests to Bobnar that they should try hunting [[Mammoth|woolly mammoths]] instead of rabbits, but Bobnar brushes him off. 

A [[Bronze Age]] army of [[War elephants|War Mammoths]] led by Lord Nooth ([[Tom Hiddleston]]) drives the tribe out of the valley and into the surrounding volcanic [[badlands]], proclaiming that the Stone Age has ended and the [[Bronze Age]] has begun. Dug tries to attack the army, but falls into a cart and is unknowingly taken to Nooth’s city. While trying to evade the guards and escape, he is mistaken for a football player and led onto the pitch before a full stadium crowd. He challenges Nooth’s elite local team to a match with the valley at stake and promises that the tribe will work in Nooth’s mines forever if they lose. Nooth dismisses the proposal at first, but changes his mind once he realises that he can profit from the match.

Dug discovers that although his ancestors invented football, the other members of his tribe are too dim to understand it. After their only ball is destroyed, Dug and his pet [[Wild boar|boar]] Hognob ([[Nick Park]]) sneak into the city to steal more but are found by a resident named Goona ([[Maisie Williams]]). Resentful over the team’s exclusion of women, she helps them steal some balls and agrees to coach the cavemen.

Goona points out that the players on Nooth’s team are talented but too egotistical to work together effectively. The cavemen improve in skill and teamwork under her coaching. Nooth receives a Message Bird ([[Rob Brydon]]) from Queen Oofeefa, warning him to not underestimate Dug's team. To demoralise Dug, Nooth has him brought to the mines and shows him cave paintings made by his tribe’s ancestors, who proved so inept at football that they never won a match and eventually gave up the sport. 

On the day of the match, with Oofeefa ([[Miriam Margolyes]]) in attendance, Dug announces his forfeiture as part of a deal to spare the rest of the tribe and agrees to take their place in the mines. However, his reinvigorated teammates persuade him to break the deal and play the match. They are down 3–1 at [[half-time]], but rally in the second half to tie the score. Nooth incapacitates the referee and takes his place, making biased calls in favour of the local team that leads to Bobnar (the cavemen's goalkeeper) being knocked out. 

Hognob takes his place and blocks a [[penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]], and Dug scores using a [[bicycle kick]] to win the match for the cavemen, 4–3. The cavemen win their village back with the respect of Oofeefa, the local team, and the crowd. Nooth tries to escape and steal the crowd's admission money, but Goona stops him with help from a giant duck; Nooth is arrested for his crimes and everyone gets their money back.

Goona and Nooth's elite local team join Dug’s tribe for a hunt, and they are chased away by a rabbit pretending to be a woolly mammoth.

==Production==
As with previous stop motion films created by Aardman, the characters in ''Early Man'' were developed over time with the voice actors to determine the way the characters look, move, and speak. The results were turned over to the film's 35 animators to work on individualizing the characters.&lt;ref name="VFXVoice"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Failes|first1=Ian|title=Aardman Goes Back to Stop-Motion Basics with EARLY MAN|url=http://vfxvoice.com/aardman-goes-back-to-stop-motion-basics-with-early-man/|accessdate=3 April 2018|work=VFX Voice|date=3 April 2018|publisher=[[Visual Effects Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A crowd of people took part in an audio recording at the [[Memorial Stadium (Bristol)|Memorial Stadium ]] Home of [[Bristol Rovers |Bristol Rovers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aardman.com/take-part-in-a-crowd-record-for-aardmans-latest-movie/|title=Take part in a Crowd Record for Aardman’s latest movie!|publisher=[[Aardman]]|date=29 May 2017|accessdate=24 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''El Sheikh Sa'id''' is a small village in the [[Minya Governorate]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. Situated on the east bank of the [[Nile]], it is named after a local [[Muslim]] saint buried in the area.

==Overview==
El Sheikh Sa'id comprises the [[rock-cut tombs]] of the [[nomarch]]s of the [[Hare nome]] (the 15th [[Upper Egypt]]ian [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]]) from the [[6th Dynasty]]. These tombs are cut in steep cliffs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicolas Grimal]], ''A History of Ancient Egypt'', New York, Barnes &amp; Noble Books, 1997, {{ISBN|0-7607-0649-2}}, p.&amp;nbsp;134&lt;/ref&gt; The use of this necropolis declined during the [[First Intermediate Period]], when the nomarchial [[necropolis]] was transferred slightly northward to [[Deir El Bersha]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfram Grajetzki]], ''The Middle Kingdom of ancient Egypt: history, archaeology and society''.

'''Enikő Bollobás''' (born June 19, 1952 in Budapest, Hungary) is a Hungarian literary scholar, Professor of the Department of American Studies at [[Eötvös Loránd University]], [[Budapest]]. Homepage: [http://www.bollobaseniko.com www.bollobaseniko.com]

==Life and work==
Bollobás has written seven books on literature as well as numerous cultural and critical articles. A graduate of ELTE (Eötvös Loránd University), she has been affiliated with this school (as associate professor, later professor) since 1990, when she co-founded the Department of American Studies with two colleagues, Zoltán Kövecses and Gyula Kodolányi.

On several occasions she was Visiting Professor and Visiting Scholar in the U.S (University of Oregon, Eugene; University of Iowa; University of California, San Diego). She has been invited to speak at various universities, including Cambridge University (England), Yale, Berkeley, Stanford, Georgetown, and George Washington University.

Her research and publication fields include [[American literature]] and culture, [[Hungarian literature]], Women’s studies/Gender studies, [[Jewish studies]], social issues.

Recipient of several awards in recognition of her scholarly achievement, Bollobás has been awarded the HUSSE Best Book Award (for her ''History of American Literature''), the László Országh Prize for lifetime achievement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungarian Society  for the Study of English|url=http://husse-esse.hu/awards/orszagh-award/|website=husse-esse.hu|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Order of Merit of the Hungarian Republic]], and the Albert Szent-Györgyi Prize.

==Political activities==
During the 1980s, Ms. Bollobás was active in the political opposition. For her participation in human and minority rights movements in Transylvania, Romanian authorities permanently expelled her from Ceauşescu’s Romania in 1982; this step was instantly backed by the Hungarian authorities, who withdrew even her “red passport” (valid to Warsaw Pact countries). As part of her commitment to human rights, in 1989 she founded the Szeged-based political discussion group ''Hungarian Feminists'', the first non-communist organization to address women’s issues.

==Public service==
After the regime change Ms. Bollobás worked in government administration: as Deputy Chief of Mission and Chargé d'Affaires at the Hungarian Embassy in Washington, D.C., and as Director of the Department of Atlantic, Northern European, and Israeli Affairs of the Hungarian Foreign Ministry in Budapest. She served as Vice Chair and Secretary General (1992–1996) of the Hungarian Atlantic Council, lobbying at the time for Hungary’s NATO membership.

==Selected publications==

=== Books ===
Her professional interests range from theories of [[modernism]] and [[postmodernism]], American [[modernist literature|modern]] and [[postmodern literature]]s, the traditions of [[experimentation]] and [[avant-garde]], and [[free verse]] [[Prosody (poetry)|prosodies]] to [[post-deconstruction]] theories, [[feminist theory]] and [[Feminist criticism|criticism]], [[American studies]] theories. She has published seven books on American literature:

{{Literature}}
An '''epic poem''', '''epic''', '''epos''', or '''epopee'''  is a lengthy [[narrative poem]], ordinarily involving a time beyond living memory in which occurred the extraordinary doings of the extraordinary men and women who, in dealings with the gods or other superhuman forces, gave shape to the moral universe that their descendants, the poet and his audience, must understand to understand themselves as a people or nation.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meyer, ''The Bedford Introduction to Literature'' (Bedford: St. Martin's, 2005), 2128. {{ISBN|0312412428}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of epic poetry is [[epyllion]] (plural: epyllia), which is a brief narrative poem with a [[romanticism|romantic]] or [[Mythology|mythological]] [[Theme (literature)|theme]]. The term, which means "little [[:wikt:epic|epic]]", came into use in the nineteenth century. It refers primarily to the erudite, shorter hexameter poems of the [[Hellenistic poetry|Hellenistic period]] and the similar works composed at Rome from the age of the [[neoteric]]s; to a lesser degree, the term includes some poems of the [[English Renaissance]], particularly those influenced by [[Ovid]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The most famous example of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] epyllion is perhaps [[Catullus 64]].

==Etymology==
The English word ''epic'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''epicus'', which itself comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] adjective {{lang|grc|ἐπικός}} (''epikos''), from {{lang|grc|ἔπος}} (''epos''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED | epic | id=63237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "word, story, poem".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=epic Epic] Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Originating before the invention of writing, primary epics were composed by bards who used complex rhetorical and metrical schemes by which they could memorize the epic as received in tradition and add to the epic in their performances. Hence aside from writers like Dante, Camões, and Milton, [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] in his ''[[Argonautica]]'' and Virgil in ''[[Aeneid]]'' adopted and adapted [[Homer]]'s [[Parallels between Virgil's Aeneid and Homer's Iliad and Odyssey|style and subject matter]], but used devices available only to those who write, and in their works [[Nonnus|Nonnus' ''Dionysiaca'']] and [[Tulsidas]]' ''[[Sri Ramacharit Manas]]'' also used stylistic elements typical of epics.

The oldest epic recognized is the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' ({{circa|2500–1300 BCE}}), which was recorded In ancient [[Sumer]] during the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]]. The poem details the exploits of [[Gilgamesh]], the king of [[Uruk]]. Although recognized as a historical figure, Gilgamesh, as represented in the epic, is a largely legendary or mythical figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Lawall |editor1-first=Sarah N. |editor2-last=Mack |editor2-first=Maynard |date=1999 |title=Norton Anthology of World Masterpieces: The Western Tradition |volume=1 |edition=7 |url= |location=New York |publisher=W.W. Norton |pages=10–11 |isbn=978-0393972894 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longest epic written is the ancient Indian ''[[Mahabharata]]'', which consists of 100,000 [[śloka]]s or over 200,000 verse lines (each shloka is a couplet), as well as long prose passages, so that at about 1.8 million words it is about four times the length of the ''[[Rāmāyaṇa]]'', and roughly ten times the length of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' combined.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G. Lochtefeld|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC&amp;pg=PA399|year=2002|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-0823931798|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SharmaGaur2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=T.R.S.

Richard Mason. ''The World's History''. Pearson Education: 2006, New Jersey. 224, {{ISBN|0131773186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous examples of epic poetry include the Sumerian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'',  the ancient Indian ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Rāmāyaṇa]]'', the Tamil ''[[Silappatikaram]]'', the Persian ''[[Shahnameh]]'', the Ancient Greek ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]'', [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'',  the Old English ''[[Beowulf]]'', [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'',  the Finnish ''[[Kalevala]]'', the German ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', the French ''[[Song of Roland]]'', the Spanish ''[[Cantar de mio Cid]]'', Camões' [[Os Lusíadas|Os ''Lusíadas'']], [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', and Adam Mickiewicz's ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]''.

==Oral epics==
The first epics were products of [[literacy|preliterate]] [[societies]] and [[oral history]] poetic traditions.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} [[Oral tradition]] was used alongside written scriptures to communicate and facilitate the spread culture.&lt;ref name="Goody1987p82"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Goody |title=The Interface Between the Written and the Oral  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TepXQMN6lfUC |year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press  |isbn=978-0521337946 |pages=110–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these traditions, poetry is transmitted to the audience and from performer to performer by purely oral means. Early twentieth-century study of living oral epic traditions in the [[Balkans]] by [[Milman Parry]] and Albert Lord demonstrated the [[Parataxis|paratactic]] model used for composing these poems. What they demonstrated was that oral epics tend to be constructed in short episodes, each of equal status, interest and importance. This facilitates memorization, as the poet is recalling each episode in turn and using the completed episodes to recreate the entire epic as he performs it. Parry and Lord also contend that the most likely source for written texts of the epics of [[Homer]] was dictation from an oral performance.

[[Milman Parry]] and [[Albert Lord]] have argued that the Homeric epics, the earliest works of Western literature, were fundamentally an oral poetic form. These works form the basis of the epic genre in Western literature. Nearly all of Western epic (including Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' and Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'') self-consciously presents itself as a continuation of the tradition begun by these poems. Classical epic poetry employs a meter called [[dactylic hexameter]] and recounts a journey, either physical (as typified by Odysseus in the ''[[Odyssey]]'') or mental (as typified by Achilles in the ''[[Iliad]]'') or both. Epics also tend to highlight cultural norms and to define or call into question cultural values, particularly as they pertain to [[heroism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Composition and conventions===

In his work ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle defines an epic as one of the forms of poetry, contrasted with [[lyric poetry]] and with drama in the form of tragedy and comedy.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotle: Poetics'', translated with an introduction and notes by M. Heath, (Penguin) London 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Handbook to Literature'' (1999), Harmon and Holman define an epic:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Epic: a long narrative poem in elevated style presenting characters of high position in adventures forming an organic whole through their relation to a central heroic figure and through their development of episodes important to the history of a nation or race. (Harmon and Holman)&lt;ref name="Harmon and Harmon"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An attempt to delineate ten main characteristics of an epic:&lt;ref name="Harmon and Harmon"&gt;Taken from William Harmon and C. Hugh Holman, A Handbook to Literature, 8th ed., Prentice Hall, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Begins [[in medias res]].
# The setting is vast, covering many nations, the world or the universe.
# Begins with an invocation to a [[muse]] (epic invocation).
# Begins with a statement of the theme.
# Includes the use of [[epithets]].
# Contains long lists, called an [[epic catalogue]].
# Features long and formal speeches.
# Shows divine intervention on human affairs.
# Features heroes that embody the values of the civilization.
# Often features the tragic hero's descent into the [[underworld]] or [[hell]].

The hero generally participates in a cyclical journey or quest, faces adversaries that try to defeat him in his journey and returns home significantly transformed by his journey. The epic hero illustrates [[Characteristics of Epic Heroes|traits]], performs deeds, and exemplifies certain morals that are valued by the society the epic originates from. Many epic heroes are [[recurring character]]s in the legends of their native culture.

Conventions of epics:{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
# ''Proposition'': Opens by stating the theme or cause of the epic. This may take the form of a purpose (as in Milton, who proposed "to justify the ways of God to men"); of a question (as in the ''[[Iliad]]'', which [[Homer]] initiates by asking a Muse to sing of Achilles' anger); or of a situation (as in the ''[[The Song of Roland|Song of Roland]]'', with [[Charlemagne]] in Spain).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
# ''[[Invocation]]'': Writer invokes a [[Muse]], one of the nine daughters of [[Zeus]]. The poet prays to the Muses to provide him with divine inspiration to tell the story of a great hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battles|first=Paul|date=2014|title=Toward a Theory of Old English Poetic Genres: Epic, Elegy, Wisdom Poetry, and the "Traditional Opening"|url=|journal=Studies in Philosophy|volume=111,1|pages=1–34|doi=10.1353/sip.2014.0001|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This convention is restricted to cultures influenced by European Classical culture. The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', for example, or the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' do not contain this element.)
# ''[[In medias res]]'': narrative opens "in the middle of things", with the hero at his lowest point. Usually flashbacks show earlier portions of the story.
# ''[[Enumeratio]]'': Catalogues and genealogies are given. These long lists of objects, places, and people place the finite action of the epic within a broader, universal context. Often, the poet is also paying homage to the ancestors of audience members.
# ''[[Epithet]]'': Heavy use of repetition or stock phrases: e.g., [[Epithets in Homer|Homer]]'s "rosy-fingered dawn" and "wine-dark sea".

== Form ==
Many verse forms have been used in epic poems through the ages, but each language's literature typically gravitates to one form, or at least to a very limited set. Ancient Sumerian epic poems did not use any kind of [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meter]] and [[Line (poetry)|lines]] did not have consistent lengths;&lt;ref name="Kramer1963"&gt;{{citation|last=Kramer|first=Samuel Noah|author-link=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character|date=1963|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-0226452388|pages=184–185|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead, Sumerian poems derived their rhythm solely through constant [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], with subtle variations between lines.&lt;ref name="Kramer1963"/&gt; [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] epic poetry, by contrast, usually places strong emphasis on the importance of line consistency and poetic meter.&lt;ref name="Kramer1963"/&gt; Ancient Greek and Latin poems were written in dactylic [[hexameter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/hexameter Hexameter, poetry at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; Old English, German and Norse poems were written in [[alliterative verse]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/alliterative-verse Alliterative verse literature at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; usually without [[rhyme]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1577">A '''family''' is defined by the [[United States Census Bureau]] for statistical purposes as "a group of two people or more (one of whom is the [[household|householder]]) related by birth, marriage, or adoption and residing together; all such people (including related subfamily members) are considered as members of one family." 

A '''family household''' is more inclusive, consisting of "a household maintained by a householder who is in a family (as defined above), and includes any unrelated people (unrelated subfamily members and/or secondary individuals) who may be residing there."&lt;ref&gt;US Census Bureau&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014 the US Census Bureau began including [[same-sex marriages]] in their counts of families and family households. Prior to this, they were counted as [[cohabitation|cohabiting partners]] and thus not considered to form a family.&lt;ref&gt;Cohn&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, households consisting of grandparents and grandchildren without the intervening generation are not "families".

{{Geodesy}}
'''GRS 80''', or '''Geodetic Reference System 1980''', is a [[geodetic reference system]] consisting of a global [[reference ellipsoid]] and a [[gravity field model]].

==Geodesy==
[[Geodesy]] is the scientific discipline that deals with the measurement and representation of the [[earth]], its [[gravitation]]al field and geodynamic phenomena ([[polar motion]], earth [[tide]]s, and crustal motion) in three-dimensional, time-varying space.

The [[geoid]] is essentially the figure of the Earth abstracted from its topographic features. It is an idealized equilibrium surface of sea water, the mean sea level surface in the absence of currents, air pressure variations etc. and continued under the continental masses. The geoid, unlike the ellipsoid, is irregular and too complicated to serve as the computational surface on which to solve geometrical problems like point positioning. The geometrical separation between it and the reference ellipsoid is called the geoidal [[wiktionary:undulation|undulation]], or more usually the geoid-ellipsoid separation, ''N''. It varies globally between {{val|110|u=m|p=±}}.

A [[reference ellipsoid]], customarily chosen to be the same size (volume) as the geoid, is described by its semi-major axis (equatorial
radius) ''a'' and flattening ''f''. The quantity ''f''&amp;nbsp;= (''a''−''b'')/''a'', where ''b'' is the semi-minor axis (polar radius), is a purely geometrical one. The mechanical ellipticity of the earth (dynamical flattening, symbol ''J''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is determined to high precision by observation of satellite orbit perturbations. Its relationship with the geometric flattening is indirect. The relationship depends on the internal density distribution.

The 1980 Geodetic Reference System (GRS 80) posited a {{val|6378137|u=m}} semi-major axis and a {{frac|298.257222101}} flattening. This system was adopted at the XVII General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics ([[IUGG]]) in Canberra, Australia, 1979.

The GRS 80 reference system was originally used by the [[WGS 84|World Geodetic System 1984]] (WGS 84). The reference ellipsoid of WGS 84 now differs slightly due to later refinements.

The numerous other systems which have been used by diverse countries for their maps and charts are gradually dropping out of use as more and more countries move to global, geocentric reference systems using the GRS80 reference ellipsoid.

==Defining features of GRS 80==
The reference ellipsoid is usually defined by its [[semi-major axis]] (equatorial
radius) &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and either its [[semi-minor axis]] (polar radius) &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, [[aspect ratio]] &lt;math&gt;(b/a)&lt;/math&gt; or [[flattening]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, but GRS80 is an exception: For a complete definition, ''four'' independent constants are required. GRS80 chooses as these &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;GM&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;J_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;, making the geometrical constant &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; a derived quantity.

; Defining [[geometrical]] [[constant (mathematics)|constants]] :

:Semi-major axis = Equatorial Radius = &lt;math&gt;a = 6\,378\,137\,\mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt;;

; Defining [[nature|physical]] [[constant (mathematics)|constants]] :

:Geocentric gravitational constant, including mass of the atmosphere &lt;math&gt;GM = 3986005\times10^8\, \mathrm{m^3/s^2}&lt;/math&gt;;

:Dynamical form factor &lt;math&gt;J_2 = 108\,263\times10^{-8}&lt;/math&gt;;

:Angular velocity of rotation &lt;math&gt;\omega = 7\,292\,115\times10^{-11}\, \mathrm{s^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;;

; Derived geometrical constants (all rounded):

:Flattening = &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; = 0.003 352 810 681 183 637 418;

:Reciprocal of flattening = &lt;math&gt;1/f&lt;/math&gt; = 298.257 222 100 882 711 243;

:Semi-minor axis = Polar Radius = &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; = 6 356 752.314 140 347 m;

:Aspect ratio = &lt;math&gt;b/a&lt;/math&gt; = 0.996 647 189 318 816 362;

:[[Earth radius#Mean radius: R1|Mean radius]] as defined by the [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] (IUGG): &lt;math&gt;R_1 = (2a+b)/3&lt;/math&gt; =  6 371 008.7714 m;

:[[Earth_radius#Authalic_radius|Authalic mean radius]] = 6 371 007.1810 m;

:Radius of a sphere of the same volume = &lt;math&gt;(a^2b)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt; = 6 371 000.7900 m;

:Linear eccentricity = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2-b^2}&lt;/math&gt; = 521 854.0097 m;

:Eccentricity of elliptical section through poles = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2-b^2}/a&lt;/math&gt; = 0.081 819 191 0435;

:Polar radius of curvature = &lt;math&gt;a^2/b&lt;/math&gt; = 6 399 593.6259 m;

:Equatorial radius of curvature for a meridian = &lt;math&gt;b^2/a&lt;/math&gt; = 6 335 439.3271 m;

:Meridian quadrant = 10 001 965.7293 m;

The formula giving the eccentricity of the GRS80 spheroid is&lt;ref&gt;p395, p398 of Bulletin Geodesique for 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^2  =  \frac {a^2 - b^2}{a^2} = 3J_2 + \frac4{15} \frac{\omega^2 a^3}{GM} \frac{e^3}{2q_0},&lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt; 2q_0 = \left(1 + \frac3{e'^2}\right) \arctan e' - \frac3{e'}&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;e' = e/\sqrt{1 - e^2} &lt;/math&gt; (so arctan e' = arcsin e).  The equation is solved iteratively to give

&lt;math&gt;e^2 = 0.00669\,43800\,22903\,41574\,95749\,48586\,28930\,62124\,43890\,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

which gives

&lt;math&gt; f = 1/298.25722\,21008\,82711\,24316\,28366\,\ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

{{see also|Front and back (phonetics)}}

In some schools of [[phonetics]], sounds are distinguished as '''grave''' or '''acute'''.  This is primarily a [[psychoacoustics|perceptual]] classification, based on whether the sounds are perceived as sharp, high [[sound intensity|intensity]], or as dull, low [[sound intensity|intensity]].  However, it can also be defined acoustically (acute sounds have a concentration of energy in the higher spectrum, versus graves which have a concentration of energy in the lower spectrum) or in terms of the [[articulation (phonetics)|articulation]]s involved.

'''Acute''' sounds generally have high perceptual intensity, and in the case of consonants have been defined as those with an [[active articulator|active articulation]] involving the tongue and a [[passive articulator|passive articulation]] involving anywhere on the roof of the mouth that a [[coronal consonant|coronal articulation]] can reach, that is, from the {{lcons|dental}} to the {{lcons|palatal}} region.  

'''Grave''' sounds are all other sounds, that is, those involving the lips as either passive or active articulator, or those involving any articulation in the [[soft palate]] or throat.

Most acute sounds are {{lcons|coronal}}, and most coronals are acute.  In particular, [[palatal consonant]]s are acute but not coronal, while [[linguolabial consonant]]s are coronal but not acute.  The distinction can be useful in [[diachronic linguistics]], as conditional sound changes often act differently on acute and grave consonants, consonants are highly likely to preserve their acuteness/graveness through sound change; and changes between acute and grave can often be well circumscribed. (For example, palatalization applied to back grave consonants usually produces acute consonants.)  In this regard, the fact that {{lcons|palatal}} articulations are included as "acute" is important because of the acoustic similarity between true palatal and [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] [[coronal consonant]]s and the fact that one often changes into the other. 

Similarly, "acute" and "{{lcons|front}}" often overlap, but again share some differences.  In particular, consonants articulated with the lip are front but not acute, and consonants with a {{lcons|palatal}} articulation are acute but not front. A parallel relationship applies to {{lcons|coronal}} and {{lcons|front}}.  Articulations with the lip as [[passive articulator]] (i.e. {{lcons|labial}} and {{lcons|labiodental}}) are front but not coronal, while {{lcons|subapical|palatal}} is coronal but not front. 

In the case of vowels, "acute" typically refers to [[front vowel]]s, which often trigger palatalization of consonants, which "grave" refers to non-front vowels.

== Modern relevance ==
&lt;!-- The following was added on 01:15, June 21, 2015, based on the talk page. It wasn't meant as part of the article, but I believe it is still an improvement, since it provides information the article was sorely lacking. --&gt;The grave/acute distinction has lost its relevance in modern phonetics, bur it may still be relevant to other disciplines. The distinction dates from relatively early in the days of acoustic phonetics, at a time that some phonologists believed that one could categorize all speech sounds by a finite set of acoustically-defined distinctive features, which were supposed to correspond to auditory impressions of sounds. The pioneering publication was Jakobson, Fant and Halle (1951) ''Preliminaries to Speech Analysis'' (MIT). Grave/acute was defined primarily in acoustic terms (with some reference to auditory qualities), but sounds were given a secondary description (or gloss) in terms of their articulation. Features like grave/acute could be used to divide speech sounds into broad classes. For most phoneticians, the JF&amp;H features had been superseded by 1968 by the articulatory features set out in Chomsky and Halle’s ''Sound Pattern of English'' and by competing articulatory features, which devised by Ladefoged in such publications as ''Preliminaries to Linguistic Phonetics'' (1971).

==Summary==
Krakauer describes the events leading up to his eventual decision to participate in an Everest expedition in May 1996, despite having mostly given up mountain-climbing years before. The 1996 expedition season recorded 8 deaths, including that of Krakauer's guide Andy Harris. This was the third-highest recorded number of deaths on the mountain in a single day; the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]] caused the most at 21.

Krakauer, a journalist for the adventure magazine ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'', initially said his intentions to climb Everest were purely professional. The original magazine story was to have Krakauer climb only to [[Everest Base Camp|base camp]], and report on the commercialization of the mountain. However, the idea of Everest reawakened his childhood desire to climb the mountain. Krakauer asked his editor to put off the story for a year so that he could train for a climb to the summit. From there, the book moves between events that take place on the mountain, and the unfolding tragedy, which takes place during the push to the summit. In the book, Krakauer alleges that essential safety methods adopted over the years by experienced guides on Everest are sometimes compromised by the competition between rival guiding agencies, in order to get their clients to the summit.

==Controversy==
Krakauer's recounting of certain aspects of the ill-fated climb has generated criticism, both from some of the climb's participants and from renowned mountaineers such as [[Galen Rowell]].  Much of the disputed material centers on Krakauer's accounting of the actions of Russian climber and guide [[Anatoli Boukreev]].  An experienced high-altitude climber and guide for Scott Fischer, Boukreev descended the summit prior to his clients, ostensibly out of concern for their safety and in preparation for potential rescue efforts. Boukreev later mounted repeated solo rescue efforts, saving several lives. In his book, Krakauer acknowledged Boukreev's heroism in saving two climbers' lives, but questions his judgment,  his decision to descend before clients, not using supplementary oxygen, his choices of gear on the mountain, and his interaction with clients. Boukreev provides a rebuttal to these allegations in his book, ''[[The Climb (book)|The Climb]]''.

[[Galen Rowell]] criticized Krakauer's account, citing numerous inconsistencies in his narrative while observing that Krakauer was sleeping in his tent while Boukreev was rescuing other climbers.  Rowell argued that Boukreev's actions were nothing short of heroic, and his judgment prescient: "[Boukreev] foresaw problems with clients nearing camp, noted five other guides on the peak [Everest], and positioned himself to be rested and hydrated enough to respond to an emergency. His heroism was not a fluke."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Climbing to Disaster|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB864852385619851000|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-09-06|issn = 0099-9660|first = Galen|last = Rowell|date = 29 May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The account has also been criticized for not informing the reader that the team members were receiving accurate daily weather forecasts and knew about the storm in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ratcliffe MBE|first=Graham|title=A Day to Die For|year=2011|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|location=UK|isbn=9781845966386|url=http://adaytodiefor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Krakauer's 1999 paperback edition of ''Into Thin Air'', he addresses some of the criticism in a lengthy postscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krakauer|first=Jon|title=Into Thin Air|year=1999|publisher=Turtleback|location=USA|isbn=9780613663618|url=https://www.amazon.com/Turtleback-School-Library-Binding-Edition/dp/0613663616/ref=tmm_hrd_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373839576&amp;sr=1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book and the film both contain the same strong editorial viewpoint regarding the fundamental causes of the tragedy, although the film differs sharply from the book in details regarding responsibility.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

: This book puts forward evidence that detailed weather forecasts were being received by several groups well in advance of their teams' summit attempts. These forecasts highlighted clearly the oncoming strong storm that struck the mountain on 10th/11th May causing the tragedy. While most of Ratcliffe's comments are directed towards the two expedition leaders for ignoring the forecasts and continuing on the summit attempts, thereby exposing clients to such high risk, he also makes clear that in his view, Krakauer and many others' description of the storm as "sudden and unexpected" is wholly inaccurate. Furthermore, Ratcliffe suggests that Krakauer, by not mentioning the forecasts, did not produce an accurate or adequately researched account.

'''James Lockhart''' (born April 8, 1933 - January 17, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite LAF|id=n82-160887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In Memoriam: James Lockhart 1933-2014: Historian of Early Latin America." ''Perspectives on History: The Newsmagazine of the American Historical Association, 52:4, April 2014, pp. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adrian J. Pearce, "James Marvin Lockhart (1933-2014)" ''Historia Mexicana'' vol. 64. No. 1 (252)(Julio-Septiembre 2014), pp. 465-470&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[United States|U.S.]] historian of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonial Latin America]], especially the [[Nahua people]] and [[Nahuatl]] language.

Born in [[Huntington, West Virginia]], Lockhart attended West Virginia University (BA, 1956) and the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] (MA, 1962; PhD, 1967).&lt;ref&gt;John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, ''Report of the President and the Treasurer'' (1977), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in life, Lockhart wrote a short, candid memoir.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, "A Historian and the Disciplines" in ''Of Things of the Indies: Essays Old and New in Early Latin American History''.Stanford: Stanford University Press 1999, pp. 333-367.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the US Army and was posted to Germany, working in "a low-level intelligence agency," translating letters from East Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Lockhart, "A Historian and the Disciplines," p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to the US, he entered the graduate program at University of Wisconsin, where he pursued his in the social history of conquest-era Peru.  

His dissertation, published in 1968 as ''Spanish Peru, 1531-1560'' was a path breaking approach to this early period. Less interested in the complicated political events of the era, he focused on the formation of Spanish colonial society in the midst of Spanish war with the indigenous and internecine struggles between factions of conquerors.  With separate chapters on different social groups, including Africans and indigenous brought into the Spanish sphere, and an important chapter on women of the conquest era, his work shifted the understanding of that era.  His main source for the people and processes of this early period were notarial documents, often property transfers and other types of legal agreements, which gave insight into the formation and function of Spanish colonial society.  The work is now a classic and was published in a second, revised edition in 1994.  

While researching ''Spanish Peru'', he compiled information on the Spaniards who received a share of the ransom of the Inca Atahualpa, extracted at Cajamarca. ''The Men of Cajamarca'' has both individual biographies of those who shared in the treasure, as well as a thorough analysis of the general social patterns of those conquerors.  Both ''Spanish Peru'' and ''The Men of Cajamarca'' have been published in Spanish translation.  

He began to do research on colonial Mexico while at University of Texas, looking both at the socioeconomic patterns there and began learning Nahuatl.  Fruits of these new interests were the publication of the anthology ''Provinces of Early Mexico: Variants of Spanish American Regional Evolution'' (edited with [[Ida Altman]]) and ''Nahuatl in the Middle Years: Language Contact Phenomena in Texts of the Colonial Period'' (with linguist [[Frances Karttunen]]). 

He moved to University of California, Los Angeles, where he spent the bulk of his teaching career 1972-1994, retiring early and continuing to collaborate with colleagues on research projects and mentor graduate students working on historical sources in the [[Nahuatl language]] and the colonial-era [[Nahua people]]. 

Among his many graduate students in colonial Spanish American social history and the philology of Mesoamerican indigenous languages, who earned doctorates under his mentorship are S.L.(Sarah) Cline, Kimberly Gauderman,  Robert Haskett, Rebecca Horn, John E. Kicza, Leslie K. Lewis, Doris Namala, Leslie Offutt, [[Matthew Restall]], Susan Schroeder, Lisa Sousa, Kevin Terraciano, John Tutino, John Super, and Stephanie Wood.

He was a major contributor to a field of [[ethnohistory]] built on the study of indigenous-language sources from colonial Mexico, which he called [[New Philology]]. He collaborated with colonial Brazilianist [[Stuart B. Schwartz]] in writing ''Early Spanish America'' (1983), which is a foundational text for graduate students studying colonial Latin America.  He was the series editor for the Nahuatl Studies Series, initially based at the UCLA Latin American Center and then jointly with Stanford University Press. Lockhart was honored by the [[Conference on Latin American History]] Distinguished Service Award in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://clah.h-net.org/?page_id=188&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 17 January 2014 at the age of 80.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.international.ucla.edu/institute/article/137546 Obituary: James Lockhart (1933-2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kaija Anneli Saariaho''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈkɑi̯jɑ ˈsɑːriɑho|lang}}; née ''Laakkonen'', born 14 October 1952) is a Finnish composer based in Paris, France.

Saariaho studied composition in Helsinki, [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]], and Paris, where she has lived since 1982. Her research at the [[IRCAM|Institute for Research and Coordination Acoustic (IRCAM)]] marked a turning point in her music away from strict [[serialism]] towards [[spectralism]]. Her characteristically rich, [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] textures are often created by combining live music and electronics.

During the course of her career, Saariaho has received commissions from the [[Lincoln Center]] for the [[Kronos Quartet]] and from [[IRCAM]] for the [[Ensemble Intercontemporain]], the [[BBC]], the [[New York Philharmonic]], the [[Salzburg Music Festival]], the [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] in Paris, and the [[Finnish National Opera]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;"Kaija Saariaho (1952–)." Ondine (album label). N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Aug. 2015. &lt;http://www.ondine.net/?cid=4.2&amp;oid=614&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Saariaho was born in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. She studied at the [[Sibelius Academy]] under [[Paavo Heininen]]. After attending the [[Darmstadt School|Darmstadt Summer Courses]], she moved to Germany to study at the [[Hochschule für Musik Freiburg]] under [[Brian Ferneyhough]] and [[Klaus Huber]]. She found her teachers' emphasis on [[Serialism|strict serialism]] and mathematical structures stifling, saying in an interview:

{{quote|You were not allowed to have pulse, or tonally oriented harmonies, or melodies. I don't want to write music through negations. Everything is permissible as long as it's done in good taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodbowl.com/search/?q=cristal|title=Du cristal|publisher=Hollywood Bowl (website)|author=Howard Posner|accessdate=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1980, Saariaho went to the Darmstadt Summer Courses and attended a concert of the French [[Spectral music|spectralists]] [[Tristan Murail]] and [[Gerard Grisey]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Alex. "Birth." ''The New Yorker.'' Condé Nast, 24 Apr. 2006. Web. 20 Aug. 2015. &lt;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/04/24/birth&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing spectral music for the first time marked a profound shift in Saariaho's artistic direction. These experiences guided her decision to attend courses in [[computer music]] that were being given by [[IRCAM]], the computer music research institute in Paris, by David Wessel, Jean-Baptiste Barrière, and Marc Battier.

In 1982, she began work at IRCAM researching computer analyses of the sound-spectrum of individual notes produced by different instruments. She developed techniques for computer-assisted composition, experimented with ''[[musique concrète]]'', and wrote her first pieces combining live performance with electronics. She also composed new works using IRCAM's CHANT synthesiser.&lt;ref&gt;"The CHANT Project: From the Synthesis of the Singing Voice to Synthesis in General". Rodet, Xavier; Potard, Yves; Barriere, Jean-Baptiste. ''Computer Music Journal'', Vol. 8, No. 3 (Autumn, 1984), p. 30. The MIT Press. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3679810. Accessed 2015-08-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of her Jardin Secret trilogy was created with the use of computer programs.

''Kaija Saariaho: visions, narratives, dialogues''. Ashgate, 2011. 82-85&lt;/ref&gt; Her works with electronics were developed in collaboration with Jean-Baptiste Barrière, a composer, multimedia artist, and computer scientist who directed the IRCAM's department of musical research from 1984 to 1987. Saariaho and Barrière married in 1982. They have two children.&lt;ref name="Ellison"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/07/arts/music-uncovering-beauty-in-ordinary-noise.html|title=Uncovering Beauty in Ordinary Noise|author=Cori Ellison|date=1999-11-07|work=New York Times|accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, Saariaho developed an emphasis on slow transformations of dense [[Sound mass|masses of sound]].&lt;ref&gt;"Biography: Kaija Saariaho." Kaija Saariaho (website). N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Aug. 2015. &lt;http://saariaho.org/biography/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Her first tape piece, ''Vers Le Blanc'' from 1982, and her orchestral and tape work, ''Verblendungen'', are both constructed from a single transition: in ''Vers Le Blanc'' the transition is from one [[Tone cluster|pitch cluster]] to another, while in ''Verblendungen'', it is from loud to quiet. ''Verblendungen'' also uses a pair of visual ideas as its basis: a brush stroke which starts as a dense mark on the page and thins out into individual strands, and the word "verblendungen" itself, which means "dazzlements".&lt;ref&gt;"Verblendung", ''Langenscheidt's Condensed Muret-Sanders Dictionary'' (ed. Heinz Messinger and the Langenscheidt Editorial Staff), 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work in the 1980s and 1990s was marked by an emphasis on [[timbre]] and the use of [[electronic music|electronics]] alongside traditional instruments. ''Nymphéa (Jardin secret III)'' (1987), for example, is for [[string quartet]] and live electronics and contains an additional vocal element: the musicians whisper the words of an [[Arseny Tarkovsky]] poem, ''Now Summer is Gone''. In writing ''Nymphea'', Saariaho used a [[fractal]] generator to create material. Writing about the compositional process, Saariaho said:

{{quote|In preparing the musical material of the piece, I have used the computer in several ways. The basis of the entire harmonic structure is provided by complex cello sounds that I have analysed with the computer. The basic material for the rhythmic and melodic transformations are computer-calculated in which the musical motifs gradually convert, recurring again and again.&lt;ref&gt;Saariaho, Kaija. Programme Note: Nymphéa (1987). New York: Commissioned by the Lincoln Center and Doris &amp; Myron Beigler for the Kronos Quartet., 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Saariaho has often talked about having a kind of [[synaesthesia]], one that involves all of the senses, saying:

{{quote|... the visual and the musical world are one to me ... Different senses, shades of colour, or textures and tones of light, even fragrances and sounds blend in my mind. They form a complete world in itself.&lt;ref&gt;Moisala, P. (2009). ''Kaija Saariaho.'' Urbana: University of Illinois Press. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another example is ''Six Japanese Gardens'' (1994), a percussion piece accompanied by a prerecorded electronic layer of the Japanese nature, traditional instruments, and chanting of Buddhist monks. During her visit to Tokyo in 1993, she expanded her original percussion conception into a semi-[[Indeterminacy (music)|indeterminate]] piece. It consists of six movements that each represent a garden composed of traditional Japanese architecture, by which she was inspired rhythmically. Especially in movement IV and V, she explored many possibilities of complex [[polyrhythm]] in liberated instrumentation. She said:

{{quote|... I felt a connection between architecture and music: both art forms select and introduce materials, let them grow, give them form, prepare new contrasting elements, create different relations between the materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kaija Saariaho|last=Moisala|first=Pirkko|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=978-0-252-03277-6|location=USA|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In her book on Saariaho, musicologist Pirkko Moisala writes about the indeterminate nature of this composition:

{{quote|[Kaija said:] 'There are so many kinds of percussion instruments which I do not know. I thought that it would be most interesting to see how the musicians choose their instruments in certain passages.' the identity and character of the composition remains the same even when the instruments are changed; each musical idea requires certain kinds of sound color but not a particular instrument.}}

On 1 December 2016, the [[Metropolitan Opera]] gave its first performance of ''[[L'Amour de loin]]'', the first opera by a female composer to be staged by the company since 1903, and the second opera by a female composer ever to be presented at the Metropolitan Opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Anthony Tommasini | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/arts/music/review-met-opera-amour-de-loin-kaija-saariaho.html | title=Review: A Newly Relevant ''L'Amour de Loin' at the Met | work=New York Times | date=2016-12-02 | accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent transmission of the opera to cinema on 10 December 2016 as part of the [[Metropolitan Opera Live in HD]] series marked the first opera by a female composer, and the first opera conducted by a female conductor ([[Susanna Mälkki]]), in the series.

'''Killamery Cross''' is a 9th-century [[high cross]] and [[National Monument (Ireland)|National Monument]] in [[Killamery]], [[County Kilkenny]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtourist.com/kilkenny/towns/killamery/|title=Killamery, Co. Kilkenny|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is located in the north of Killamery graveyard.&lt;ref name="nigelborrington.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nigelborrington.com/tag/killamery-high-cross/|title=Killamery high cross - Nigel Borrington|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A monastery was established at Killamery by [[St._Gobhan#Gobban_of_Killamery|St Gobhan]], a disciple of [[Saint Fursey]], in AD 632. The Killamery High cross is part of the western [[Osraige|Ossory]] group of crosses, used as a model for many of the small high crosses sold across the world as an Irish symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PggIclfQfx0C|title=From Ireland Coming: Irish Art from the Early Christian to the Late Gothic Period and Its European Context|first=Colum|last=Hourihane|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locals formerly touched the cross's capstone to cure [[headache]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TDlIAQAAIAAJ|title=An introduction to Irish high crosses|first1=Hilary|last1=Richardson|first2=John|last2=Scarry|date=1 January 1990|publisher=Mercier Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRjFBdR3cLgC|title=Early Medieval Munster: Archaeology, History and Society|first1=Michael A.|last1=Monk|first2=John|last2=Sheehan|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Cork University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The cross stands {{Convert|3.65|m|ft}} high. It is richly sculptured on the shaft with [[Calendula officinalis|marigold]] flowers carved on it. There is a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the middle of the wheel-head that is surrounded by interlacing [[snakes]] and, above the boss, an open-mouthed [[dragon]], giving it the name of the Snake-Dragon Cross. 

The western face has a sun [[swastika]] at the centre and also depicts [[Adam and Eve]], a stag hunt and a chariot procession.&lt;ref name="nigelborrington.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irishantiquities.bravehost.com/kilkenny/killamery/killamery.html|title=Killamery High Cross|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On top of the cross is a gabled cap-stone. [[Noah]] and [[John the Baptist]] are depicted. On the base an inscription reads &lt;small&gt;OR DO MAELSECHNAILL&lt;/small&gt;, "a prayer for [[Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid|Máel Sechnaill]]", who was [[high king of Ireland]] in 846–862.

===Other artefacts===
There is also a cross-slab of an earlier date the inscription &lt;small&gt;OROIT AR ANMAIN N-AEDAIN&lt;/small&gt;, "Pray for the [[Soul#Christianity|soul]] of Áedáin". Two [[bullaun stones]] can also be seen. There is also a [[holy well]], St Goban's Well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=27089|title=Killamery High Cross|first=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith|last=Map|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/tullahoughttidytownskilkenny/windgap-parish/killamery-high-cross|title=Killamery High Cross - Tulllahought Tidy Towns|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.megalithicireland.com/High%20Cross%20Killamery.htm|title=Killamery High Cross|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{POV|date=February 2017}}
The '''Krishnamurti Foundation'''{{when|date=May 2018}} is not a religious organisation nor does it have any spiritual authority.

==Description==
[[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] (1895–1986), whose life and teachings spanned the greater part of the 20th century, is regarded by many as one who has had the most profound impact on human consciousness in modern times. The foundation provides a service to those who may be interested in pursuing an understanding of the teachings in their own lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Krishnamurti Foundations|url=http://www.jkrishnamurti.org/worldwide-information/foundations.php|website=jkrishnamurti.org|publisher=J Krishnamurti Online|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundations maintain an extensive archive of Krishnamurti's original works in the form of hand-written material, books, transcripts and audio and video tapes of hundreds of talks and discussions, meetings and conversations. There is also a collection of Krishnamurti's letters, photographs and reference material about him, his life, and his works.

The foundations are also actively engaged in the publication of this material in various forms. Over 60 books are in print and more are in preparation. About 300 videotapes and 400 audio cassettes are available, along with an extensive printed Index. etc. An increasing amount of this material is being translated. Over 30 languages are available including all major European and most Indian languages as well as Japanese, Cantonese, Mandarin, Russian, Korean and Hebrew.

The LPP is a Mixed Research Unit (UMR 7018) with more than 40 members including 7 researchers, 12 research professors, 3 engineers and more than 30 doctoral and post-doctoral students. It is specialized in teaching and research in experimental [[phonetics]] and in [[phonology]], offering graduate-level courses leading to a doctoral degree. One of its central research themes is the development of an integrated approach to phonetics and phonology.

Its principal research areas have included:

* variation in spontaneous [[speech]]
* [[clinical phonetics]]
* [[Prosody (linguistics)]]: analysis, typology, interfaces
* [[phonological system]]s: models, descriptive studies, typology
* development of tools for research and teaching
* [[acoustic phonetics]] and [[Manner of articulation|articulatory]] modelling

The laboratory is located at l'Institut de Phonétique de Paris on 19 rue des Bernardins. Research in clinical phonetics is conducted at the [[Service d'Oto-Rhino-Laryngologie]] (ORL) of the [[Hôpital Européen Georges-Pompidou]] (HEGP), Paris. In 2008 the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]] gave the Laboratoire de Phonétique et Phonologie the task of creating a technological platform to study normal and pathological speech. 

This platform includes: 
* a large sound-insulated recording booth 
* high quality sound recording equipment
* [[high-speed camera]]
* [[ultrasound tongue imaging]] 
* [[electromyography]]
* [[Electroglottograph|electroglottography]]
* [[electropalatography]]
* non-invasive photoglottography
* photonasography
* [[kymograph]]

The '''Levi Rock Shelter''', named for former property owner Malcolm Levi, is an archeological site west of [[Austin, Texas]] where [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]] Native American artifacts dating back 10,000 years or more have been discovered.

Located along Lick Creek, the site was discovered in the mid-1950s and is believed to be the 7th-oldest [[paleolithic]] site in the United States. Many artifacts have been uncovered there, including [[Clovis point]]s, carved bone cylinders, scrapers, awls, needles, punches, and incised and painted pebbles. Many are now in the care of the [[University of Texas]].

The site, and its adjoining creek, are believed by local activists to be threatened by nearby development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/12/06/6lickcreek.html Statesman.com, December 6, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120914153758/http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/12/06/6lickcreek.html |date=September 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shelter was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1971.

==History==

===Origins===
According to legend, the [[Gautama Buddha]]  visited [[Dhanyawadi]], the capital city of Arakan during his travels on a [[Proselytization]] mission to spread Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Daw"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Buddhist art of ancient Arakan: an eastern border state beyond ancient India, east of Vanga and Samatata|publisher=Volume 43, Issue 4 of Burmese cultural microfilm collection, Daw Saw Saw|year=1979|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 26th anniversary of the King at the time, a devout Buddhist, the Buddha accompanied by Shin Ananda and 500 disciples&lt;ref name="Daw"/&gt; landed at Salagiri mountain peak near Khaukrah town.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"&gt;Schober, p.267&lt;/ref&gt; The King of Arakan, along with his Chief Queen Sandra Mala (with her retinue of 1,600 ladies in waiting), and an entourage of ministers, generals and officials, paid homage to the Buddha.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt; They were deeply moved by his teachings and upon his departure to Thawuthi ([[Sravasti]]), the King insisted that he leave his image for people to worship.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt; For this purpose, the Buddha then sat under a [[Bodhi tree]] for a week of meditation.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt; During this time [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Sakka]] (in [[Pāli]], the ruler of the [[Trāyastriṃśa]] Heaven in [[Buddhist cosmology]], supported by his assistant Vissakamma, moulded a lifelike image of the Buddha using ornaments donated by the king and his people.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt; It is also said that Sakka and Vissakamma (or Vishvakarman) created a separate pavilion for the Buddha to live and enjoy during these seven days.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt; After looking at his own lifelike image, believed at the time to have been his only true-likeness,&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Buddha was pleased and "imbued the image with his spiritual essence", or "enlivened and consecrated" the image, naming it "Candasara".&lt;ref name= Keown/&gt; He also stated that the image would last for five thousand years as his representative.&lt;ref name=legend/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aung&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aung |first=Myo|author2=H.Kraft|title= Upper Myanmar Mandalay Pyin Oo Lwin Sagaing Monywa Mingun Mogok Shwebo|work=Mahamuni Buddha|pages=4–5|accessdate=2010-03-24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zt2T_QO6OtAC&amp;pg=PT2&amp;dq=Mahamuni+Buddha+Pagoda,+Mandalay&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Sr-pS7C2INKfrAf25dGmAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true|publisher= Books on Asia|isbn=9789749290859}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.268"&gt;Schober, p.268&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Juliane Schober has very succinctly explained this legend and the cult worship that has evolved around the "living" double image of Mahamuni Buddha:
{{clear}}
{{quotation|The rich and complex mythology associated with this image includes episodes that parallel other stories about the Buddha...The rituals and myths of Mahamuni thus accomplish two aims simultaneously: they place local contexts and actors within a universal Buddhist cosmology, and they locate a continuing biography of the Buddha in the Buddhist politics of Arakan and Upper Burma. [[Theravada]] politics characteristically extended the biographical mode of recreating the Buddha's presence and associated with it the power of kings and other patrons of this image. The veneration of this Buddha image is thus informed by local conceptions of religious patronage in sociopolitical domains.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.260"&gt;Schober, p.260&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Buddha in Sarnath Museum (Dhammajak Mutra).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Gautama Buddha]]]]
Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle relates to the nine phenomena that occurred when the image was consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed. These nine phenomena were: holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels; the water from the tank that was used for washing the Buddha's head would retain its quality throughout the year; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped the image in the evenings; the rays faded in the presence of non-believers; the space in the temple would automatically accommodate any number of devotees; the leaves of trees would tilt in the direction of the Buddha image; birds would not fly over the temple; and the stone guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.269"&gt;Schober, p.269&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|left|The large bronze statues.jpg|160|The large Bronze Figures.jpg|175|Left: Large bronze statues believed to have healing powers when rubbed. Right: [[Airavata]]–Three headed Elephant and other statues of [[Shiva]].}}
Another legend narrated is linked to the six [[Cambodia|Khmer]] bronze statues (three lions–with heads substituted later in Burmese style, a three-headed elephant known as [[Airavata]], and two warriors in the form of [[Shiva]]), which are installed in the temple in the northern end of the courtyard. These statues were originally at the [[Angkor Wat]] temple complex in [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref name= "Abbott, p.33"&gt;Abbott, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Devotees believe that the statues have healing qualities to rub a particular part of the body against the statues to cure themselves of various ailments and diseases.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name= Keown/&gt;&lt;ref name=legend/&gt;

===Image history===

[[File:Prince Thado Minsaw.JPG|thumb|left|[[Thado Minsaw]], Crown Prince and son of [[Bodawpaya]] carried off the Mahamuni to Mandalay.]]

In the ancient history of Arakan, King [[Anawratha]] of [[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan]] (r. 1044–1077) attempted to move the image to [[Bagan|Pagan]], without success.&lt;ref name= "Schober p.260"&gt;Schober p.260&lt;/ref&gt; In 1784, the [[Bamar|Burmese]] under the military leadership of Crown Prince [[Thado Minsaw]] of [[Konbaung dynasty]] conquered the Kingdom of [[Mrauk U]].&lt;ref name=rlf-109&gt;{{cite book | title=The River of Lost Footsteps--Histories of Burma | author=Thant Myint-U | pages=109–110 | year=2006 | publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux | isbn=978-0-374-16342-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious relics of the kingdom, including the Mahamuni Buddha image, were confiscated and installed in the Mahamuni temple or Pagoda at [[Amarapura]], on the outskirts of the old capital of Mandalay. As the Mahamuni image was too large to transport as a whole, it was cut into sections and later reassembled and housed in the new temple.&lt;ref name= "Schober p.266"&gt;Schober p.266&lt;/ref&gt;  Mandalay became the capital under King [[Mindon Min|Min]]don (r. 1853–1878).&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, p.685&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the capital under his son [[Thibaw Min|Thibaw]] (r. 1878–1885) of the [[Konbaung Dynasty]] (1752–1885). When the British annexed Upper Burma in 1885 to prevent the French from dominating it, monarchic rule ended.&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; However, veneration of the Mahamuni image has continued, and is visited and idolised by many pilgrims, mainly [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]], [[Mon people|Mon]] and [[Bamar|Burmans]] peoples.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name= Keown/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.260-261"&gt;Schober, p.260-261&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fink&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fink|first=Christina|title= Living silence: Burma under military rule

Several old bronze statues that line the courtyard of the temple have a long history as war loot. They were originally [[Khmer architecture|Khmer statues]], found at [[Angkor Wat]] in [[Cambodia]], and were taken to [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] in 1431 by the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Siamese]].&lt;ref name= "Abbott, p.33"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vella, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Greenwood, p.128"&gt;Greenwood, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; In 1564, the Burmese king [[Bayinnaung]] conquered Ayutthaya and took thirty such statues to [[Bago, Burma|Bago]] (Pegu).&lt;ref name= "Greenwood, p.128"/&gt;&lt;ref name=geh&gt;{{cite book | last=Harvey | first=G.E. | title=History of Burma | page=168 | chapter=Toungoo Dynasty: IIIrd Siege of Ayuthia | year=1925 | publisher=Frank Cass &amp; Co.

They are a major attraction because of their purported healing qualities.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name= Keown/&gt;

===Damage===
[[File:Mahamuni.JPG|right|thumb|A statue of Maha Muni Buddha or Maha Myat Muni Paya or Rakhine Paya or Payagyi enshrined in a temple/pagoda at [[Mandalay]].]]
The Mahamnuni image and its precincts suffered damage from fires in 1879 and 1884.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"&gt;Schober, p.263&lt;/ref&gt; In the fire that broke out during the reign of King Thibaw, the seven-tiered spire on the brick temple, devotional halls, causeways and others were burnt down, although the Great Image itself was saved. Gold recovered after the fire was made into a robe that currently adorns the image. In 1887, Minister [[Kinwun Mingyi U Kaung]] took charge of the site and in 1896 constructed the present temple around the original shrine built by King Bodawpaya.&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt;

In 1996, the [[State Law and Order Restoration Council|military rulers]] in Burma undertook renovation work on the Mahamuni Pagoda. During this period, the Mahamuni Buddha image was damaged in 1997 when a hole appeared in the belly of the Great Image.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"&gt;Fink, p.219&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that thieves had drilled the hole in an attempt to steal jewels believed to be secreted within the image.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt; It was reported that a military officer had requested to open the temple in the night, resulting in a meeting of all the senior monks from major monasteries in the area to discuss the matter.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt; Whilst the meeting was in progress, attention was diverted to a purported rape incident committed by a Muslim man on a Buddhist girl.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt; A major riot broke out but it turned out afterward that the Buddhist girl had not been raped at all.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt; It was a coverup to divert attention away from the Buddha so it could be repaired.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt; However, the mystery remains as to whether any jewellery did exist and was actually removed from the Great Image at all.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt;

===Main Temple/Pagoda===

The Mahamuni Temple or Pagoda is a complex of structures located along a road from Mandalay leading to the southwest. It was originally located on A brick paved road which was constructed from the Royal Palace of King [[Bodawpaya]] to the eastern gate of the temple, although only remnants of this road can still be seen.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt; A major teaching monastery of some 400 monks of the [[Thudhamma Nikaya]] (order), is one among the many monasteries which are adjacent to the Pagoda. The temple has a central shrine and is framed by an extensive grass lawn. The arcades leading to the main shrine have many kiosks, selling religious paraphernalia such as incense, candles, rosaries, flowers, robes, sandals etc., and various restaurants and tea shops. The [[sanctum sanctorum]], where the large Mahamuni image is deified, is a small chamber and has a roof covering made up of seven ''[[pyatthat]]'' meaning tiered roofs (derivative of the [[Sanskrit Language|Sanskrit]] word ''prasada'').&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt;&lt;ref name=palace&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=619905|title=The Reconstruction of  Mandalay Palace: An Itermi Report on Aspects of Design|publisher=|quote=...epitomized by tiered roofs, the ''pya-that'' found in both royal and religious architecture.

The arcades are supported by 252 gilded and carved columns adorned with fine frescoes.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt;

The Mahamuni Buddha image is housed in a  small chamber, seated on a throne in a divine posture known as the ''Bhumisparsa [[Mudra]]''. This posture or mudra symbolises Buddha's vanquishing of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]). The legs are crossed with feet turned inwards, and the right hand touches the ground ritualistically, as a witness of his past deeds.&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt; The image is cast in [[bronze]] and weighs 6.5 tonnes and is erected on a {{convert|1.84|m|ft}} high pedestal and reaches a height  of {{convert|3.82|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt; Its shoulders measure {{convert|1.84|m|ft}} and its waist measures {{convert|2.9|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt; It is draped in royal costumes with "Brahmanic cords (''[[salwe]]'') and regalia crossing his chest".&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt; The image is crowned, bejewelled with [[diamond]]s, [[Ruby|rubies]] and [[sapphire]]s. The left hand appears imprecise, unusually large, and is seen resting in the lap with an upturned palm.

[[Gold leaf|Gold leaves]] are regularly applied to the face of the Mahamuni Buddha by male devotees. Consequent to the frequent application of gold leaves, the coating of gold (thickness {{convert|15|cm|in}}) has given a shapeless contour to the Mahamuni image. However, it is also noted that the right hand, crown and other iconographic characteristics of royalty are free of gold leaf covering, which gives an impression that these were later additions to the original image of the Mahamuni.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mara/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pagoda&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myokyawhtun.com/photo-gallery/mahamuni-buddha.html|title=Mahamuni Pagoda|accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, when the pagoda was burnt down, {{convert|91|kg|lbs}} of gold was recovered from the site, which represents the continued historical veneration and perpetuation of the cult of Mahamuni.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"&gt;Schober, p.267&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other features===
[[File:Sacred fish pond @ Maha Muni.jpg|thumb|left| Sacred fish and tortoise pond near the Mahamuni Pagoda.]]
A large number of 'inscription stones' collected by King Bodawpaya are seen in a long gallery in the southeastern corner of the temple courtyard. These inscriptions, some of which are made from gilded marble and sandstone, have been collected from many regions of the country.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name= Keown/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pagoda/&gt; There is also a large water tank in the southeast direction of the temple where fish and turtles are fed with [[rice cake]]s by the large number of pilgrims who visit the temple every day.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"&gt;Schober, p.267&lt;/ref&gt; Adjacent to the Buddha temple is the Mahamuni Museum, which contains displays of Buddhism throughout [[Asia]].

==Daily rituals==
{{double image|right|Mahamuni Buddha (1).jpg|200|Mahamuni Buddha (2).jpg|200|Left: Early morning ritual of face wash to Mahamuni Buddha. Right: Early morning brushing the teeth of Mahamuni Buddha.}}
On February 17, 1988, the present Ven Sayadaw Buddhanta Panya Vamsa of [[Htilin Monastery]] and Pitaka Kyaung initiated the ritual of daily face washing of the deity at dawn. This ritual commences every morning at 4 am or 4:30 am when [[monks]] wash the face and brush the teeth of the Buddha image.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt; It is an elaborate ritual performed for over an hour by a senior monk dressed in monastic attire, assisted by several lay helpers, dressed in white and wearing formal headdress. As soon as the drums are struck, the senior monk residing in the adjoining monastery enters the sanctum and starts the formal face washing ritual with a succession of fresh towels, offered by devotees. He then performs the act of cleaning the Mahamuni's teeth with a large brush followed by one more sequence of cleaning with fresh towels.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt; After this, [[sandalwood]] paste is applied to the image and it is again cleaned with towels and finally sprinkled with scented water. After the ceremony is completed, the used towels are returned to the devotees who keep these towels with reverence in their home shrines.&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt;

On special occasions, such as [[Uposatha]] day, an orange stole is placed around its shoulders by the presiding monk and is fanned.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.264"&gt;Schober, p.264&lt;/ref&gt; A major congregation of devotees witness the rituals; some men sit in the front enclosure while others including women and children sit in the middle and rear end of the foyer. Devotees offer food and other items brought by them on a tray to the deity and chant prayers while the rituals are being performed.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt; During the winter season, the image is covered by a cloak of the monastic order.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.264"/&gt;

During the reign of Burmese monarchs, offerings were made daily to the Great Image in a formal way. Food and other offerings, sheltered by a Royal white umbrella, were taken in a procession from the palace, escorted by a Minister, as an honour due to a sovereign head of the state.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"&gt;Schober, p.267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt;

==Festival==
A major annual [[pagoda festival]] known as the 'Mahamuni Paya Pwe' ('pwe' meaning "festival") is held in early February, at the end of the [[Vassa|Buddhist Lent]] to celebrate the history of the pagoda. During this festival, aside from the daily rituals,  the ''[[Patthana]]'' from a "Book of Conditional Relations" is recited.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.272"&gt;Schober, p.272&lt;/ref&gt; This book is a philosophical text which Buddha recounted to his mother in a sermon in ''[[Tavatimsa]]'' heaven and is a sacred scripture in the [[Pali language]].&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.272"&gt;Schober, p.272&lt;/ref&gt; The Pattana recitation is a special feature, which continues for several days. Monks recite from the scriptures, in groups of two or three. The festivities also include various forms of entertainment programmes such as dance, music, theatre etc., and there is also a social event, allowing families and friends gather to greet each other.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.272"&gt;Schober, p.272&lt;/ref&gt; Given that large crowds of pilgrims are attracted during the festive season, guards are posted near the Great Image and video cameras are placed in many parts of the temple precincts to protect it.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;

'''Megasthenes''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ᵻ|ˈ|g|æ|s|θ|ᵻ|n|iː|z}} {{respell|mi|GAS|thi-neez}}; {{lang-grc|Μεγασθένης}}, c. 350 – c. 290 BC) was an ancient Greek historian, diplomat and [[Indian people|Indian]] [[List of Graeco-Roman geographers|ethnographer]] and explorer in the [[Hellenistic period]]. He described [[India]] in his book ''[[Indica (Megasthenes)|Indika]]'', which is now [[lost work|lost]], but has been partially reconstructed from the writings of the later authors.

Megasthenes was born in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] and became an ambassador of [[Seleucus I Nicator]] of the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid dynasty]] to [[Chandragupta Maurya]] in [[Pataliputra]], [[India]].{{sfn|Radha Kumud Mookerji|1988|p=38}} However, the exact date of his embassy is uncertain. Scholars such as Kaushik Roy place him in the Maurya court between 302 and 298 BCE, prior to Chandragupta's voluntary death in 297.{{sfn|Kaushik Roy|2012|pp=61-62}} Other Greek envoys to the Indian court are known after Megasthenes: [[Deimachus]] as ambassador to [[Bindusara]], and [[Dionysius (ambassador)|Dionysius]], as ambassador to [[Ashoka]].&lt;ref&gt;"Three Greek ambassadors are known by name: Megasthenes, ambassador to Chandragupta; Deimachus, ambassador to [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta's]] son Bindusara; and Dyonisius, whom Ptolemy Philadelphus sent to the court of Ashoka, Bindusara's son", McEvilley, p.367&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Burjor Avari|2007|pp=108-109}}

==Life and travel==
[[File:Embassy of Megasthenes.jpg|thumb|According to [[Arrian]], Megasthenes lived in [[Arachosia]] and travelled to [[Pataliputra]].|215x215px]]
Megasthenes was a Greek ambassador of [[Seleucus I Nicator]] in the court of [[Chandragupta Maurya]].{{sfn|Paul J. Kosmin|2014|p=38}} [[Arrian]] explains that Megasthenes lived in [[Arachosia]], with the [[satrap]] [[Sibyrtius]], from where he visited India:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Megasthenes lived with Sibyrtius, satrap of Arachosia, and often speaks of his visiting [[Sandracottus]], the king of the Indians." [[Arrian]], ''[[Anabasis Alexandri]]'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://websfor.org/alexander/arrian/book5a.asp |chapter=Book 5 |title=Anabasis |titlelink=Anabasis Alexandri |authorlink=Arrian |author=Arrian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We have more definite information regarding the parts of India Megasthenes visited. He entered the subcontinent through the district of the Pentapotamia ("The five rivers", modern day [[Punjab region]]&lt;ref name="zum.de"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/india/xwpunjab.html |work=World History at KMLA |title=History of West Punjab (Pakistan)}}&lt;/ref&gt;), providing a full account of the rivers found there (thought to be the five affluents of the [[Indus River|Indus]] that form the Punjab region), and proceeded from there by the royal road to Pataliputra. There are accounts of Megasthenes having visited [[Madurai]], in Tamil Nadu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/india/gal_india_south_02.shtml|title=BBC - History - Ancient History in depth: The Story of India: South India|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/i-am-overwhelmed-by-this-great-city/article3258073.ece#|title=“I am overwhelmed by this great city”|first=Shastry V.|last=Mallady|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but he appears not to have visited any other parts of India.

'''''Indika''''' (Greek: Ἰνδικά; Latin: '''''Indica''''') is an account of Mauryan India by Megasthenes. The original book is now lost, but its fragments have survived in later Greek and Latin works. The earliest of these works are those by [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Strabo]] (''[[Geographica]]''), [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]], and [[Arrian]] (''[[Indica (Arrian)|Indica]]'').&lt;ref name="US_2008"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg=PA381 |title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India |author=Upinder Singh |publisher=Pearson Education India |year=2008 |isbn=9788131711200 |pages=324 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RlCUBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62 |title=Greek Buddha: Pyrrho's Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia |author = [[Christopher I. Beckwith]] |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2015 |isbn= 9781400866328 |page=62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reconstruction ===

Megasthenes' ''Indica'' can be reconstructed using the portions preserved by later writers as direct quotations or paraphrase. The parts that belonged to the original text can be identified from the later works based on similar content, vocabulary and phrasing, even when the content has not been explicitly attributed to Megasthenes. [[Felix Jacoby]]'s ''[[Fragmente der griechischen Historiker]]'' contains 36 pages of content traced to Megasthenes.{{sfn|Paul J. Kosmin|2013|p=99}}

Schwanbeck's Fragment XXVII includes four paragraphs from Strabo, and Schwanbeck attributes these entire paragraphs to Megasthenes. However, Strabo cites Megasthenes as his source only for three isolated statements in three different paragraphs. It is likely that Strabo sourced the rest of the text from sources other than Megasthenes: that's why he attributes only three statements specifically to Megasthenes.{{sfn|Sandhya Jain|2011|p=22}}

Another example is the earliest confirmed description of [[Gangaridai]], which appears in the writings of Diodorus. McCrindle believed that Diodorus' source for this description was the now-lost book of Megasthenes. However, according to A. B. Bosworth (1996), Diodorus obtained this information from [[Hieronymus of Cardia]]: Diodorus described Ganges as 30 stadia wide; it is well-attested by other sources that Megasthenes described the median or minimum width of Ganges as 100 stadia.{{sfn|A. B. Bosworth|1996|pp=188-189}}

=== India according to the reconstructed text ===

According to the text reconstructed by [[J. W. McCrindle]], Megasthenes' ''Indica'' describes India as follows:

==== Geography ====

India is a quadrilateral-shaped country, bounded by the ocean on the southern and the eastern side.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=49}} The Indus river forms the western and the north-western boundary of the country, as far as the ocean.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=46}} India's northern border reaches the extremities of [[Taurus Mountains|Tauros]]. From [[Ariana]] to the Eastern Sea, it is bound by mountains that are called Kaukasos by the Macedonians. 

At the southern tip of India, the [[gnomon]] of the sundial often casts no shadow, and the [[Ursa Major]] is invisible at night. In the remotest parts, the shadows fall southward, and even [[Arcturus]] is not visible.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=30}}

India has many large and navigable rivers, which arise in the mountains on its northern border. Many merge into [[Ganges river|Ganges]], which is 30 stadia wide at its source, and runs from north to south. The Ganges empties into the ocean that forms the eastern boundary of [[Gangaridai]].{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=33}} Other nations feared Gangaridai's huge force of the biggest elephants, and therefore, Gangaridai had never been conquered by any foreign king.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=33-34 }} 

[[Indus river|Indus]] also runs from north to south, and has several navigable tributaries.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=34 }} In addition, there are a large number of other rivers, supplying abundant water for agriculture. According to the native philosophers and natural scientists, the reason for this is that the bordering countries are more elevated than India, so their waters run down to India, resulting in such a large number of rivers.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=34-35 }}

==== History ====
[[File:Pataliputra Palace capital by L A Waddell 1895.jpg|thumb|[[Pataliputra capital]], showing Greek and Persian influence, early [[Mauryan Empire]] period, 4th–3rd century BC.]] 
In the primitive times, the Indians lived on fruits and wore clothes made of animal skin, just like the Greeks. The most learned Indian scholars say that [[Dionysus]] invaded India, and taught Indians several things including how to grow plants, make wine and worship. He founded several large cities, introduced laws and established courts. For this reason, he was regarded as a deity by the Indians. He ruled entire India for 52 years, before dying of old age. His descendants ruled India for several generations, before being dethroned and replaced by democratic city-states.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=35-38 }}

The Indians who inhabit the hill country also claim that [[Megasthenes' Herakles|Herakles]] was one of them. Like the Greeks, they characterize him with the club and the lion's skin. According to them, Herakles was a powerful man who subjugated evil beasts. He had several sons and one daughter, who became rulers in different parts of his dominion. He founded several cities, the greatest of which was Palibothra ([[Pataliputra]]). Herakles built several places in this city, fortified it with water-filled trenches and settled a number of people in the city. His descendants ruled India for several generations, but never launched an expedition beyond India. After several years, the royal rule was replaced by democratic city states, although there existed a few kings when Alexander invaded India.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=39-40}}

==== Flora and fauna ====

India has several mountains with fruit trees of every kind.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=30}} There are a large number of animal species in India. The Indian elephants are far stronger than the [[North African elephant|Libyan elephants]], because of the abundance of food on the Indian soil. The elephants are domesticated in large numbers, and [[war elephant|trained for war]].{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=31}} The gestation period of the elephants ranges from 16 to 18 months, and the oldest of the elephants live up to 200 years.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=44 }}

==== Economy ====

Gold, silver, copper and iron are abundant on Indian soil. Tin and other metals are used for making a number of tools, weapons, ornaments, and other articles.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=31}}

India has very fertile plains, and irrigation is practised widely.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=31}} The main crops include rice, millet, a crop called ''bosporum'', other cereals, pulses and other food plants.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=32}} There are two [[agricultural cycle|crop cycles]] per year, since rain falls in both summer and winter. At the time of summer solstice, rice, millet, ''bosporum'' and [[sesamum]] are sown. During winter, wheat is sown.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=32}}

==== Society ====

Because of its large size, India is inhabited by many diverse races, all of which are indigenous. India has no foreign colony, and Indians have not established any colonies outside India.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=35 }} The Indians are of above average stature, because of abundant food, fine water and pure air. They are well-skilled in art.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=31}}

A law, prescribed by ancient Indian philosophers, bans slavery. The law treats everyone equally, but allows the property to be unevenly distributed.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=40 }}

The population of India is divided into 7 endogamous and hereditary castes:{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=40-44 }}

# '''[[Brahmin|Philosophers]]'''
# '''Farmers'''
# '''[[Herder]]s'''
# '''[[Artisan]]s'''
# '''[[Kshatriya|Military]]'''
# '''Overseers'''
# '''Councillors and Assessors'''

==== Administration ====

The foreigners are treated well. Special officers are appointed to ensure that no foreigner is harmed, and judges hand out harsh punishment to those who take unfair advantage of the foreigners. Sick foreigners are attended by physicians and taken care of. Foreigners who die in India are buried, and their property is delivered to their relatives.{{sfn|J. W. McCrindle|1877|p=44-45 }}

=== Historical reliability ===

Later writers such as [[Arrian]], [[Strabo]], [[Diodorus]], and [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]] refer to ''Indika'' in their works. Of these writers, Arrian speaks most highly of Megasthenes, while Strabo and Pliny treat him with less respect.

The first century Greek writer Strabo called both Megasthenes and his succeeding ambassador [[Deimachus]] liars, and stated that "no faith whatever" could be placed in their writings.{{sfn|Allan Dahlaquist|1996|p=28}} The ''Indika'' itself contained numerous fantastical stories of people with backwards feet, ears large enough to sleep in, no mouths, or other strange features. Strabo directly contradicted these descriptions, assuring his readers that Megasthenes' stories, along with his recounting of India’s founding by Hercules and Dionysus, were mythical with little to no basis in reality.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, Geography, Book XV, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Paul J. Kosmin, ''Indica'' depicts contemporary India as an unconquerable territory, in order to justify [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]]'s retreat from India. Megasthenes tries to argue that Dionysus was able to conquer India, because before his invasion, India was a primitive rural society. Dionysus' urbanization of India makes India a powerful, impregnable nation. The later ruler — the [[Megasthenes' Herakles|Indian Herakles]] — is presented as a native of India, despite similarities with the [[Heracles|Greek Heracles]]. This, according to Kosmin, is because now India is shown as unconquerable.{{sfn|Paul J. Kosmin|2013|p=98-100}} Megasthenes emphasizes that no foreign army had been able to conquer India (since Dionysus) and Indians had not invaded a foreign country either. This representation of India as an isolated, invincible country is an attempt to vindicate Seleucus' peace treaty with the Indian emperor.{{sfn|Paul J. Kosmin|2013|p=103-104}}

Megasthenes states that there were no slaves in India, but the ''[[Arthashastra]]'' attests to the existence of slavery in contemporary India;{{sfn|Romila Thapar|1990|p=89}} Strabo also counters Megasthenes's claim based on a report from [[Onesicritus]].{{sfn|Antoinette Fauve-Chamoux|2004|p=548}} Historian Shireen Moosvi theorizes that slaves were outcastes, and were not considered members of the society at all.{{sfn|Antoinette Fauve-Chamoux|2004|p=548}} According to historian [[Romila Thapar]], the lack of sharp distinction between slaves and others in the Indian society (unlike the [[Slavery in ancient Greece|Greek society]]) may have confused Megasthenes: Indians did not use large-scale slavery as a means of production, and slaves in India could buy back their freedom or be released by their master.{{sfn|Romila Thapar|1990|pp=89-90}}

Megasthenes mentions seven castes in India, while the Indian texts mention only four social classes ([[varna in Hinduism|varnas]]). According to Thapar, Megasthenes' categorization appears to be based on economic divisions rather than the social divisions; this is understandable because the varnas originated as economic divisions. Thapar also speculates that he wrote his account some years after his visit to India, and at this time, he "arrived at the number seven, forgetting the facts as given to him". Alternatively, it is possible that the later authors misquoted him, trying to find similarities with the Egyptian society, which according to [[Herodotus]], was divided into seven social classes.{{sfn|Romila Thapar|2012|p=118}}

== Legacy ==

Megasthenes' ''Indica'', along with [[Ctesias]]' book of the same name, is among the earliest well-known Western accounts of India and he is regarded as one of the founders of the study of Indian history in the West. He is also the first foreign Ambassador to be mentioned in Indian history.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Megasthenes also comments on the presence of [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic]] views among the Brahmans and Jews. Five centuries later Clement of Alexandria, in his [[Stromateis]], may have misunderstood Megasthenes to be responding to claims of Greek primacy by admitting Greek views of ''physics'' were preceded by those of Jews and Indians. Megasthenes, like [[Numenius of Apamea]], was simply comparing the ideas of the different ancient cultures.{{sfn|Bezalel Bar-Kochva|2010|p=157|ps=: "He does not respond to the implied claim of Greek primacy, presumably because he did not have, and could not have had, hard information about the beginnings of "parallel" opinions among the Brahmans."}}

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to games and gaming:

'''[[Game]]s''' &amp;ndash; structured or semi-structured activities, usually undertaken for [[enjoyment]]. They are usually fun activities that can be educational or purely just for fun. The term "game" is also used to describe simulation of various activities e.g., for the purposes of training, analysis or prediction, etc., see "[[Game (simulation)]]".  Games are a universal part of the human experience, for all cultures, genders and ages.  Key components of games are goals, [[wiktionary:Rule|rule]]s, [[wiktionary:challenge|challenge]], and [[interactivity]].  Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and sometimes both.  Many games help develop practical [[skills]], serve as a form of [[exercise]], or otherwise perform an [[education]]al, [[simulation]]al or [[psychology|psychological]] role.

'''Pancho Haralanov Vladigerov''' {{IPA-bg|ˈpantʃo xaraˈɫaŋov vɫadiˈɡɛr̩ov|}} (or Wladigeroff, or Wladigerow, or Vladiguerov, or Vladigueroff; {{lang-bg|Панчо Хараланов Владигеров}}; 13 March 1899{{spaced ndash}}8 September 1978) was a [[Bulgaria]]n composer, pedagogue, and pianist.

Vladigerov is arguably the most influential Bulgarian composer of all time. He was one of the first to successfully combine idioms of [[Bulgarian folk music]] and the [[classical music]]. Part of the so-called ''Second Generation Bulgarian Composers'', he was among the founding members of the Bulgarian Contemporary Music Society (1933), which later became the Union of Bulgarian Composers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubc-bg.com Union of Bulgarian Composers]&lt;/ref&gt; Vladigerov marked the beginning of a number of genres in Bulgarian music, including the [[violin sonata]] and the [[piano trio]]. He was also a very respected pedagogue; his students include practically all notable Bulgarian composers of the next generation, such as [[Alexander Raichev]], [[Alexander Yossifov]], [[Stefan Remenkov]], and many others, as well as the pianist [[Alexis Weissenberg]].

== Biography ==
[[File:BASA-1271K-1-161-60-Pancho Vladigerov.JPG|thumb|250px|Pancho Vladigerov]]
Vladigerov was born in [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]], but lived in [[Shumen]], Bulgaria. His mother Dr. Eliza Pasternak was a [[History of the Jews in Russia|Russian Jew]]. She is a relative of the famous writer [[Boris Pasternak]], who was first cousins with Vladigerov&lt;ref&gt;Словото на Панчо Владигеров, Димитров Д. Държавно издателство „Музика“, София, 1988 г.,page 86&lt;/ref&gt;. His father Dr. Haralan Vladigerov was a Bulgarian lawyer and a politician. Pancho Vladigerov played the piano and composed from an early age. In 1910, two years after his father's early death, Vladigerov and the rest of his family moved to Sofia, where Pancho started studying composition with [[Dobri Hristov]], the most distinguished Bulgarian composer of his generation.

Pancho's maternal grandfather, Leon Pasternak, a Russian Jew who left Odessa and settled in Zurich a few years before Pancho's birth, was a very influential figure in Pancho's musical development and later success. The grandfather, a mathematician by profession, champion chess player,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=5531 Leon Pasternak – Hans Fahrni, 5th Swiss Championship, Zurich, June 1895]&lt;/ref&gt; and an amateur musician and composer, used to play the violin with Pancho and his twin brother. Based on a Jewish tune his grandfather taught him, Vladigerov composed in 1950 his great symphony, the "Jewish Poem", Opus 47. This symphony received in 1952 the highest honor given by the Bulgarian Government to an artist, the Dimitrov Prize,&lt;ref name="etd.lsu.edu"&gt;[http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-06082004-163256/unrestricted/Buckles_dis.pdf The Significance of Selected Piano Compositions by Pancho Vladigerov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718211755/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-06082004-163256/unrestricted/Buckles_dis.pdf |date=2010-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned him the admiration of his fellow musicians:

"A work like this is written only once in a hundred years", [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] exclaimed.&lt;ref name="etd.lsu.edu"/&gt;

In 1912 Vladigerov's mother managed to obtain a governmental scholarship for her children to study in [[Berlin]], where Pancho and his twin brother, the violinist [[Luben Vladigerov]], were enrolled at the Staatliche Akademische Hochschule für Musik (now part of the [[Berlin University of the Arts]]), which was under the auspices of the [[Akademie der Künste|Academy of Arts]]. Pancho Vladigerov studied music theory and composition with [[Paul Juon]]&lt;ref name="mphbio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Publication of Preface to Score of Vladigerov's 1st Violin Concerto|url=http://musikmph.de/musical_scores/prefaces/S-Z/vladigerov_violin1.html|last=Schlüren|first=Christoph|year=2004|publisher=Musikproduktion Juergen Hoeflich|accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and piano with [[Karl Heinrich Barth]].&lt;ref name="mphbio" /&gt; In 1920 he graduated from the Academy after having studied piano also with [[Leonid Kreutzer]], composition with [[Friedrich Gernsheim]] and [[Georg Schumann (composer)|Georg Schumann]]. He twice won the [[Mendelssohn Scholarship|Mendelssohn Prize]] of the Academy (in 1918 and 1920).

After his graduation Vladigerov became music director at [[Deutsches Theater (Berlin)|Deutsches Theater]] in Berlin and worked with the famous theatre director [[Max Reinhardt]]. In 1932, after much hesitation, he decided to return to Sofia, where he was appointed professor in Piano, Chamber Music and Composition at the State Academy of Music, which is now named after him.

Vladigerov composed in a variety of genres including an opera (''Tsar Kaloyan'', to a libretto by Nikolai Liliev and [[Fani Popova-Mutafova]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vladigerov Biography Page|publisher=Bulgarian Operas: Course Material at University of Pittsburgh Center for International Studies|url=http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/opera/BULGOP/comp/vladig.htm|date=April 2005|accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ballet, symphonic music, five piano concertos, two violin concertos, chamber music including string quartet, trio (violin, cello and piano), works and transcriptions for violin and piano and numerous opuses for solo piano,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editionelm.org/cat_e.htm#piano] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923075503/http://www.editionelm.org/cat_e.htm |date=2006-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 38 transcriptions of instrumental pieces for instrument and piano, 13 late transcriptions of his earlier works for two pianos,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editionelm.org/cat_e.htm#two_pianos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923075503/http://www.editionelm.org/cat_e.htm |date=2006-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; fifty folksong concert arrangements for voice and piano/orchestra, 20 songs for voice and piano, ten choral songs with piano/orchestra, [[incidental music]] for the performances of the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, the Theater in der Josefstadt in [[Vienna]], and the National Theatre in Sofia.

Vladigerov gained considerable fame in Europe in the 1920s when many of his pieces were published by [[Universal Edition]] in Vienna and released on LPs by the German recording company [[Deutsche Grammophon]] before being performed throughout Europe and the USA. As pianist and composer he toured most of the European countries performing mainly his own works. In 1969 he was awarded the [[Herder Prize]] by the [[University of Vienna]]. The Bulgarian recording company Balkanton released an edition of his stage and symphony music in four sets of seven LPs each; however, only a very small portion of his works is currently available on CD.

Vladigerov's music has been admired by such diverse personalities as [[Richard Strauss]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], and [[Aram Khachaturian]]. It has been performed by artists such as [[Alexis Weissenberg]], [[David Oistrakh]], [[Emil Gilels]], [[Ivan Drenikov]] and, most recently, [[Marc-André Hamelin]]; however, he still remains a largely unknown name except in his home country. His solo piano music has been performed in concert several times in the UK recently by Bulgarian-born pianist [[Valentina Seferinova]], who continues to champion his music.

Vladigerov's most performed and emblematic work is unquestionably ''Vardar Rhapsody'', also known as ''Bulgarian Rhapsody''. Originally written for violin and piano, it was later orchestrated and arranged for various instruments. A fiery patriotic work, it has become, in the words of an admiring critic "the Bulgarian equivalent of [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]'s Polonaise in A Major".

Pancho Vladigerov died in 1978 in [[Sofia]].  His house at No. 10, Yakubitsa, has been transformed into a museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vladigerov.org/index.php?p=8 The House Museum in Sofia]&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Alexander Vladigerov]] (1933–1993) and grandchildren [[Pancho Vladigerov Jr.]], [[Alexander Wladigeroff]], and [[Konstantin Wladigeroff]] have also become respected musicians.

An international music competition held in [[Shumen]] since 1986 is named after Vladigerov. In the autumn of 2006 Pancho Vladigerov Jr. founded The Intellectual Legacy of Pancho Vladigerov Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vladigerov.org/ The Intellectual Legacy of Pancho Vladigerov Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; Its main aim is to preserve, protect and popularise Pancho Vladigerov's tangible and intangible heritage.

The National Academy of Music, "Prof. Pancho Vladigerov," located in Sofia, Bulgaria, is named for Vladigerov.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nma.bg/en/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vladigerov Passage]] in [[Antarctica]] is named after Pancho Vladigerov.&lt;ref&gt;[https://data.aad.gov.au/aadc/gaz/scar/display_name.cfm?gaz_id=137776 Vladigerov Passage.] SCAR [[Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Petrography''' is a branch of [[petrology]] that focuses on detailed descriptions of [[rock (geology)|rocks]]. Someone who studies petrography is called a '''petrographer'''. The [[mineral]] content and the [[Rock microstructure|textural]] relationships within the rock are described in detail. The classification of [[rocks]] is based on the information acquired during the '''petrographic analysis'''. Petrographic descriptions start with the field notes at the outcrop and include macroscopic description of hand specimens. However, the most important tool for the petrographer is the [[petrographic microscope]]. The detailed analysis of minerals by [[optical mineralogy]] in [[thin section]] and the micro-texture and structure are critical to understanding the origin of the rock. [[Electron microprobe]] analysis of individual grains as well as whole rock chemical analysis by [[atomic absorption]], [[X-ray fluorescence]], and [[laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy]] are used in a modern petrographic lab. Individual mineral grains from a rock sample may also be analyzed by [[X-ray diffraction]] when optical means are insufficient. Analysis of microscopic [[fluid inclusions]] within mineral grains with a heating stage on a petrographic microscope provides clues to the temperature and pressure conditions existent during the mineral formation.

==History==
Petrography as a science began in 1828 when Scottish physicist [[William Nicol (geologist)|William Nicol]] invented the technique for producing [[polarized light]] by cutting a crystal of [[Iceland spar]], a variety of [[calcite]], into a special prism which became known as the [[Nicol prism]]. The addition of two such prisms to the ordinary microscope converted the instrument into a polarizing, or [[petrographic microscope]]. Using transmitted light and Nicol prisms, it was possible to determine the internal crystallographic character of very tiny mineral grains, greatly advancing the knowledge of a rock's constituents.

During the 1840s, a development by [[Henry Clifton Sorby|Henry C. Sorby]] and others firmly laid the foundation of petrography. This was a technique to study very thin slices of rock. A slice of rock was affixed to a microscope slide and then ground so thin that light could be transmitted through mineral grains that otherwise appeared opaque. The position of adjoining grains was not disturbed, thus permitting analysis of [[rock texture]]. [[Thin section]] petrography became the standard method of rock study. Since textural details contribute greatly to knowledge of the sequence of crystallization of the various mineral constituents in a rock, petrography progressed into petrogenesis and ultimately into petrology.

It was in Europe, principally in Germany, that petrography advanced in the last half of the nineteenth century.

==Methods of investigation==

===Macroscopic characters===
The macroscopic characters of rocks, those visible in hand-specimens without the aid of the microscope, are very varied and difficult to describe accurately and fully. The geologist in the field depends principally on them and on a few rough chemical and physical tests; and to the practical engineer, architect and quarry-master they are all-important. Although frequently insufficient in themselves to determine the true nature of a rock, they usually serve for a preliminary classification, and often give all the information needed.

With a small bottle of [[acid]] to test for carbonate of lime, a knife to ascertain the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]] of rocks and minerals, and a pocket lens to magnify their structure, the field geologist is rarely at a loss to what group a rock belongs. The fine grained species are often indeterminable in this way, and the minute mineral components of all rocks can usually be ascertained only by microscopic examination. But it is easy to see that a sandstone or grit consists of more or less rounded, water-worn sand grains and if it contains dull, weathered particles of feldspar, shining scales of mica or small crystals of calcite these also rarely escape observation. Shales and clay rocks generally are soft, fine grained, often laminated and not infrequently contain minute organisms or fragments of plants. Limestones are easily marked with a knife-blade, effervesce readily with weak cold acid and often contain entire or broken shells or other fossils. The crystalline nature of a granite or basalt is obvious at a glance, and while the former contains white or pink feldspar, clear vitreous quartz and glancing flakes of mica, the other shows yellow-green olivine, black augite, and gray stratiated plagioclase.

Other simple tools include the blowpipe (to test the fusibility of detached crystals), the [[goniometer]], the magnet, the magnifying glass and the specific gravity balance.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petrology |inline=1 |last=Flett |first=John Smith  |volume=21 |pages=323-333 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri21chisrich#page/323/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microscopic characteristics===
[[File:LvMS-Lvm.jpg|thumb|Photomicrograph of a [[volcanic]] [[sand grain]]; upper picture is plane-polarized light, bottom picture is cross-polarized light, scale box at left-center is 0.25 millimeter.]]
{{main|Optical mineralogy}}
When dealing with unfamiliar types or with rocks so fine grained that their component minerals cannot be determined with the aid of a hand lens, a microscope is used. Characteristics observed under the microscope include colour, colour variation under plane [[polarised light]] ([[pleochroism]], produced by the lower [[Nicol prism]], or more recently [[Polarizer#Absorptive polarizers|polarising films]]), fracture characteristics of the grains, refractive index (in comparison to the mounting adhesive, typically [[Canada balsam]]), and optical symmetry ([[Birefringence|birefringent]] or [[isotropy|isotropic]]). ''In toto'', these characteristics are sufficient to identify the mineral, and often to quite tightly estimate its major element composition.
The process of identifying minerals under the microscope is fairly subtle, but also mechanistic - it would be possible to develop an [[identification key]] that would allow a computer to do it. The more difficult and skilful part of optical petrography is identifying the interrelationships between grains and relating them to features seen in hand specimen, at outcrop, or in mapping.

===Separation of components===
Separation of the ingredients of a crushed rock powder to obtain pure samples for analysis is a common approach. It may
be performed with a powerful, adjustable-strength electromagnet. A weak magnetic field attracts magnetite, then haematite and other iron ores. Silicates that contain iron follow in definite order—biotite, enstatite, augite, hornblende, garnet, and similar ferro-magnesian minerals are successively abstracted. Finally, only the colorless, non-magnetic compounds, such as muscovite, calcite, quartz, and feldspar remain. Chemical methods also are useful.

A weak acid dissolves calcite from crushed limestone, leaving only dolomite, silicates, or quartz. Hydrofluoric acid attacks feldspar before quartz and, if used cautiously, dissolves these and any glassy material in a rock powder before it dissolves augite or hypersthene.

Methods of separation by specific gravity have a still wider application. The simplest of these is [[wiktionary:levigate|levigation]], which is extensively employed in mechanical analysis of soils and treatment of ores, but is not so successful with rocks, as their components do not, as a rule, differ greatly in specific gravity. Fluids are used that do not attack most rock-forming minerals, but have a high specific gravity. Solutions of potassium mercuric iodide (sp. gr. 3.196), cadmium borotungstate (sp. gr. 3.30), methylene iodide (sp. gr. 3.32), bromoform (sp. gr. 2.86), or acetylene bromide (sp. gr. 3.00) are the principal fluids employed. They may be diluted (with water, benzene, etc.) or concentrated by evaporation.

If the rock is granite consisting of biotite (sp. gr. 3.1), muscovite (sp. gr. 2.85), quartz (sp. gr. 2.65), oligoclase (sp. gr. 2.64), and orthoclase (sp. gr. 2.56), the crushed minerals float in methylene iodide. On gradual dilution with benzene they precipitate in the order above. Simple in theory, these methods are tedious in practice, especially as it is common for one rock-making mineral to enclose another. However, expert handling of fresh and suitable rocks yields excellent results.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;

===Chemical analysis===
In addition to naked-eye and microscopic investigation, chemical research methods are of great practical importance to the petrographer. Crushed and separated powders, obtained by the processes above, may be analyzed to determine chemical composition of minerals in the rock qualitatively or quantitatively. Chemical testing, and microscopic examination of minute
grains is an elegant and valuable means of discriminating between mineral components of fine-grained rocks.

Thus, the presence of apatite in rock-sections is established by covering a bare rock-section with ammonium molybdate solution. A turbid yellow precipitate forms over the crystals of the mineral in question (indicating the presence of phosphates). Many
silicates are insoluble in acids and cannot be tested in this way, but others are partly dissolved, leaving a film of gelatinous
silica that can be stained with coloring matters, such as the aniline dyes (nepheline, analcite, zeolites, etc.).

Complete chemical analysis of rocks are also widely used and important, especially in describing new species. Rock analysis has of late years (largely under the influence of the chemical laboratory of the United States Geological Survey) reached a high pitch of refinement and complexity. As many as twenty or twenty-five components may be determined, but for practical purposes a knowledge of the relative proportions of silica, alumina, ferrous and ferric oxides, magnesia, lime, potash, soda and water carry us a long way in determining a rock's position in the conventional classifications.

A chemical analysis is usually sufficient to indicate whether a rock is igneous or sedimentary, and in either case to accurately show what subdivision of these classes it
belongs to. In the case of metamorphic rocks it often establishes whether the original mass was a sediment or of volcanic origin.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;

===Specific gravity===
Specific gravity of rocks is determined by use of a balance and pycnometer. It is greatest in rocks containing the most magnesia, iron, and heavy metal while least in rocks rich in alkalis, silica, and water.
It diminishes with weathering. Generally, the specific gravity of rocks with the same chemical composition is higher if highly crystalline and lower if wholly or partly vitreous. The specific gravity of the more common rocks range from about 2.5 to 3.2.&lt;ref name=EB1911 /&gt;

==Archaeological applications==
[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] use petrography to identify mineral components in [[pottery]]. This information ties the artifacts to geological areas where the raw materials for the pottery were obtained. In addition to clay, potters often used rock fragments, usually called "temper" or "aplastics", to modify the clay's properties. The geological information obtained from the pottery components provides insight into how potters selected and used local and non-local resources. Archaeologists are able to determine whether pottery found in a particular location was locally produced or traded from elsewhere. This kind of information, along with other evidence, can support conclusions about settlement patterns, group and [[individual mobility]], social contacts, and trade networks. In addition, an understanding of how certain minerals are altered at specific temperatures can allow archaeological petrographers to infer aspects of the [[ceramic]] production process itself, such as minimum and maximum temperatures reached during the original firing of the pot.

A '''platform mound''' is any [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] or [[mound]] intended to support a structure or activity.

==Eastern North America==
[[File:Mississippian culture mound components HRoe 2011.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A diagram showing the various components of Eastern North American indigenous ceremonial substructure mounds]]
[[File:15 30 186 ocamulgee.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Temple Mount at [[Ocmulgee National Monument]]]]
The [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous peoples of North America]] built substructure mounds for well over a thousand years starting in the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]] and continuing through the [[Woodland period]]. Many different archaeological cultures ([[Poverty Point culture]], [[Troyville culture]], [[Coles Creek culture]], [[Plaquemine culture]] and [[Mississippian culture]]) of North Americas Eastern Woodlands are specifically well known for using platform mounds as a central aspect of their overarching [[religious]] practices and beliefs. These platform mounds are usually four-sided [[Frustum|truncated pyramids]], steeply sided, with steps built of wooden logs ascending one side of the [[Earthwork (archaeology)|earthwork]]s. When European first arrived in North America, the peoples of the Mississippian culture were still using and building platform mounds. Documented uses for Mississippian platform mounds include semi-public [[Tribal chief|chief]]'s house platforms, public [[temple]] platforms, [[mortuary]] platforms, [[charnel house]] platforms, [[earth lodge]]/town house platforms, residence platforms, square ground and rotunda platforms, and dance platforms.&lt;ref name="PLATFORM"&gt;{{cite journal|author1 = Owen Lindauer|author2 = John H.

Many of the mounds underwent multiple episodes of mound construction, with the mound becoming larger with each event. The site of a mound was usually a site with special significance, either a pre-existing mortuary site or civic structure.

Some mounds were developed with separate levels (or terraces) and aprons, such as [[Emerald Mound]], which is one large terrace with two smaller mounds on its summit; or [[Monks Mound]], which has four separate levels and stands close to {{convert|100|ft|m}} in height. Monks Mound had at least ten separate periods of mound construction over a 200-year period. Some of the terraces and aprons on the mound seem to have been added to stop slumping of the enormous mound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Skele, Mike|url = https://archive.org/stream/greatknobinterpr00skel#page/102/mode/2up|title = The Great Knob|journal = Studies in Illinois Archaeology|number = 4|location = Springfield, Illinois|publisher = Illinois Historic Preservation Agency|year = 1988|isbn = 0-942579-03-8|pages = 102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the mounds were primarily meant as substructure mounds for buildings or activities, sometimes burials did occur. Intrusive burials occurred when a grave was dug into a mound and the body or a bundle of defleshed, disarticulated bones was deposited into it. Mound C at [[Etowah Mounds|Etowah]] has been found to have more than 100 intrusive burials into the final layer of the mound, with many grave goods such as [[Mississippian copper plates]] ([[Etowah plates]]), monolithic stone axes, [[Mississippian culture pottery|ceremonial pottery]] and carved whelk [[shell gorgets#Mississippian|shell gorgets]]. Also interred in this mound was a paired set of white marble [[Mississippian stone statuary#Etowah|Mississippian stone statues]].&lt;ref name=FLORIDAANTHRO/&gt;

===Interpretations===
A long-standing interpretation of Mississippian mounds comes from Vernon James Knight, who stated that the Mississippian platform mounds were one of the three "sacra", or objects of sacred display, of the Mississippian religion - also see [[Earth/fertility cult]] and [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]]. His [[logic]] is based on [[analogy]] to [[ethnographic]] and [[historic]] data on related [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[tribe|tribal]] groups in the Southeastern United States.

Knight suggests a microcosmic ritual organization based around a "native earth" [[autochthon (person)|autochthon]]y, agriculture, fertility, and purification scheme, in which mounds and the site layout replicate [[cosmology]]. Mound rebuilding episodes are construed as rituals of burial and renewal, while the four-sided construction acts to replicate the flat earth and the four quarters of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |author= Knight, Vernon J., Jr.| year=1981| title =Mississippian Ritual |degree=Ph.D. |publisher= University of Florida }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Knight, Vernon J., Jr.|year=1986 |title=The Institutional Organization of Mississippian Religion| journal= [[American Antiquity]]| volume=51| pages=675–687 |url= https://www.jstor.org/pss/280859 | doi=10.2307/280859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Mary}}
'''Protestant views on Mary''' include the [[theological]] positions of major Protestant representatives such as Martin Luther and John Calvin as well as some modern representatives.  While it is difficult to generalize about the place of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] in [[Protestantism]] given the great diversity of Protestant beliefs, some summary statements are attempted.

While reformers such as [[Martin Luther]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]] at different points in their writings had expressed what seem to be examples of a residual [[catholic]] Marian piety,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walter Tappolet |year=1962 |title=Das Marienlob der Reformatoren |publisher=Tübingen &lt;!--really the location, but no publisher given--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=George Henry Tavard |year=1996 |title=The Thousand Faces of the Virgin Mary |publisher=Liturgical Press |pages=103 |isbn=0-8146-5914-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Protestant emphasis on ''[[sola scriptura]]'', ''[[solus Christus]]'', ''[[soli Deo gloria]]'', among others kept the honoring of Mary to a minimum, and Protestant teaching about Mary co-terminous with her short part in scripture and [[creed]]s. A newer Protestant view of Mary emerging out of the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical movement]] sees Mary as a feisty, assertive, and radically Christian woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scot McKnight |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/december/8.26.html |title=The Mary We Never Knew |journal=Christianity Today |accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protestant theologians==
Some early Protestants venerated and honored Mary. [[Martin Luther]] said of Mary:

{{quote|the honor given to the mother of God has been rooted so deeply into the hearts of men that no one wants to hear any opposition to this celebration... We also grant that she should be honored, since we, according to Saint Paul's words [Romans 12] are indebted to show honor one to another for the sake of the One who dwells in us, Jesus Christ. Therefore we have an obligation to honor Mary. But be careful to give her honor that is fitting. Unfortunately, I worry that we give her all too high an honor for she is accorded much more esteem than she should be given or than she accounted to herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Basely|first1=Joel R.|title=Festival Sermons of Martin Luther|date=2005|publisher=Mark V Publiscations|location=Dearborn, Michigan|isbn=0-9652403-1-2|page=167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfLCU2Nkxa8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA157&amp;|accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[John Calvin]] said, "It cannot be denied that God in choosing and destining Mary to be the Mother of his Son, granted her the highest honor."{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} [[Zwingli]] said, "I esteem immensely the Mother of God" and "The more the honor and love of Christ increases among men, so much the esteem and honor given to Mary should grow".{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Thus the idea of respect and high honour was not rejected by the first Protestants; but rather it was the matter of degrees of honor given to Mary, as the mother of Jesus, that [[Protestant Reformers]] were concerned with, and therefore the practical implications for [[Mariology]] are still a matter of debate.

===John Wycliffe===
The pre-Lutheran reformer [[John Wycliffe]] reflected the Marian spirit of the [[later Middle Ages]] in one of his earlier sermons: "It seems to me impossible that we should obtain the reward of Heaven without the help of Mary. There is no sex or age, no rank or position, of anyone in the whole human race, which has no need to call for the help of the Holy Virgin."&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martin Luther===
[[File:StPierreJeuneP156.JPG|thumb|A statue of Mary in the Protestant church of [[Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune Protestant Church|Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune]], Strasbourg]]
{{main article|Lutheran Marian theology}}
Despite Luther's polemics against his Roman Catholic opponents over issues concerning Mary and the saints, theologians appear to agree that Luther adhered to the Marian decrees of the [[ecumenical council]]s and dogmas of the church. He held fast to the belief that Mary was a perpetual virgin and the [[Theotokos]] or [[Mother of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Remigius Bäumer, ''Marienlexikon Gesamtausgabe'', Leo Scheffczyk, ed., (Regensburg: Institutum Marianum, 1994), 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Special attention is given to the assertion, that Luther some three-hundred years before the dogmatization of the [[Immaculate Conception]] by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1854, was a firm adherent of that view. Others maintain that Luther in later years changed his position on the Immaculate Conception, which, at that time was undefined in the Church, maintaining however the sinlessness of Mary throughout her life.&lt;ref&gt;Bäumer, 191&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the [[Assumption of Mary]], he stated that the [[Bible]] did not say anything about it. Important to him was the belief that Mary and the saints do live on after death.&lt;ref&gt;Bäumer, 190.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Throughout his career as a priest-professor-reformer, Luther preached, taught, and argued about the veneration of Mary with a verbosity that ranged from childlike piety to sophisticated polemics. His views are intimately linked to his christocentric theology and its consequences for liturgy and piety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1 =[[Eric W. Gritsch]] |editor1=H. George Anderson |editor2=J. Francis Stafford |editor3=Joseph A. Burgess |title=The One Mediator, The Saints and Mary, Lutherans and Roman Catholic in Dialogue |volume=VII |location=Minneapolis |publisher=Augsburg Fortress |year=1992 |pages=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luther, while revering Mary, came to criticize the "Papists" for blurring the line, between high admiration of the grace of God wherever it is seen in a human being, and religious service given to another creature. He considered the Roman Catholic practice of celebrating [[saint]]s' days and making intercessory requests addressed especially to Mary and other departed saints to be [[idolatry]].&lt;ref&gt;''Luther's Works'', 47, pp. 45f; see also, ''Lutherans and Catholics in Dialogue'' VIII, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Calvin===
{{main article|John Calvin's views on Mary}}
John Calvin accepted Mary's perpetual virginity and the title "Mother of God", in a qualified sense. He considered himself the real follower of Mary{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} because he freed her from misuses of these titles and undeserved "Papist" honour which is due only to Jesus Christ, and for returning this honour to him alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Calvin |title=Commentary on John |volume=1 |chapter=On John 2:1-11 |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom34.viii.i.html |accessdate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin stated that Mary cannot be the advocate of the faithful, since she needs God’s grace as much as any other human being.&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Works'', Serm. de la proph. de Christ: op  35, 686.&lt;/ref&gt; If the Catholic Church praises her as Queen of Heaven, it is blasphemous and contradicts her own intention, because she is praised and not God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Calvin |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom31.ix.ix.html |title=Harmony of the Evangelists |volume=1 |chapter=On Luke 1:46-50 |accessdate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin expressed deep concern over its possible "superstitious" use of the title "Mother of God" from the teachings of the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] :&lt;ref&gt;Calvin to the Foreigners’ Church in London, 27 October 1552, in [[George Cornelius Gorham]], [https://books.google.com/books?vid=0bbTMcT6wXFWRHGP&amp;id=esICAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=%22george+cornelius+gorham%22 ''Gleanings of a few scattered ears, during the period of [[Reformation in England]] and of the times immediately succeeding : A.D. 1533 to A.D. 1588''] (London: Bell and Daldy, 1857), p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not doubt that there has been some ignorance in their having reproved this mode of speech, — that the Virgin Mary is the Mother of God … I cannot dissemble that it is found to be a bad practice ordinarily to adopt this title in speaking of this Virgin: and, for my part, I cannot consider such language as good, proper, or suitable… for to say, the Mother of God for the Virgin Mary, can only serve to harden the ignorant in their superstitions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Karl Barth===
{{main article|Karl Barth's views on Mary}}
[[Karl Barth]] (1886–1968), a [[Reformed Protestant]], was a leading 20th century theologian. Aware of the common dogmatic tradition of the early Church, Barth fully accepted the dogma of Mary as the [[Mother of God]]. In his view, through Mary, Jesus belongs to the human race; through Jesus, Mary is Mother of God. Barth also agreed with the [[Dogma]] of the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin Birth]]. It meant to him that Jesus as a human does not have a father and that as the Son of God he has no mother. The Holy Spirit, through whom Mary conceived, is not just any spirit, but it is God himself whose act must be understood spiritually and not physically.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatic I, 2, 219&lt;/ref&gt;  Mary is "full of grace" according to Barth, but this grace is not earned but totally given to her. Regarding Mary’s [[virginity]] after birth, Barth argued that the Church adopted this position not because of Mary but in defence of its [[Christology]]. Barth considered the Roman Catholic veneration of Mary a terrible mistake and [[idolatry|idolatrous]] heresy.&lt;ref&gt;"Where ever Mary is venerated, and devotion to her takes place, there the Church of Christ does not exist" (''Church Dogmatics'', I, 2, 154). "Catholic mariology is a cancer, a sick theological development, and cancers should be cut out" (''Church Dogmatics'', I, 2, 153). "The heresy of the Catholic Church is its mariology and Marian cult." (''Church Dogmatics'', I, 2, 157).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues in Protestant theology==

===Mother of God===
The designation ''[[Theotokos]]'' (in {{lang-el|Θεοτόκος}}) or "Bearer of God" for Mary emerged in the [[Church of Alexandria]] and was later adopted by the [[patristic]]-era universal Church at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431. It is a statement of [[Christology|Christological]] orthodoxy (See: [[Hypostasis (Christianity)|hypostasis]]) in opposition to [[Nestorianism]] and also a devotional [[Titles of Mary|title of Mary]] used extensively in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Oriental Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox]], and [[Anglican]] liturgy. The second verse of a well known Protestant hymn, [[Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones]], is directly addressed to Mary and is based on an Orthodox prayer.

Presently the [[Lutheran World Federation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.lutheranworld.org/sites/default/files/1993-Lutheran_Orthodox_Dialogue-EN.pdf |title=7th Plenary of the Lutheran-Orthodox Joint Commission in Sandbjerg, Denmark |chapter=The Ecumenical Councils and Authority in and of the Church |publisher=The Lutheran World Federation |date=10 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; accepts the teachings of the [[Council of Ephesus]] and other [[ecumenical council]]s of the [[patristic]]-era Church, including the formulation "Mother of God" as a function of Christ's [[hypostatic union]]. Luther says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Martin Luther |title=Selected Writings of Martin Luther |year=2007 |editor=Theodore G. Tappert |publisher=Fortress Press |isbn=0-8006-6226-1 |pages=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We too know very well that God did not derive his divinity from Mary; but it does not follow that it is therefore wrong to say that God was born of Mary, that God is Mary’s Son, and that Mary is God’s mother.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mariolatry===

{{Expand section|date=May 2016|small=no}}

In the 18th and 19th centuries various groups of Protestants began to use the term ''Mariolatry'' to refer to the [[Veneration of Mary in Roman Catholicism|Catholic]], [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] practices of [[Marian devotions|Marian veneration and devotion]]. In their view, the attention paid to Mary is extreme, and may not only distract from the worship of [[God in Christianity|God]], but actually borders on [[idolatry]].&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Christian Church'' by Philip Schaff 1960 {{ISBN|0-8028-8049-5}} pages 411 and 422&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Keegan, Matthew C. (2011, April 27). Book Review: The Virgin Mary in the Light of the Word of God. ''WordJourney Magazine'', Retrieved from http://www.wordjourney.com&lt;/ref&gt;

This trend has taken various directions over time, in that while some Protestants have at times softened their attitude towards it, others have strengthened their opposition in the 21st century. For instance, during the May 2006 celebrations at [[Our Lady of Walsingham]] in England, as [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] held a Marian procession, Protestant [[heckler]]s held banners that condemned [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Masses]], idolatry and "Mariolatry".&lt;ref&gt;''The Everything Jesus Book: His Life, His Teachings'' by Jon Kennedy 2006 {{ISBN|1-59337-712-6}} page 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Walsingham in Literature and Culture from the Middle Ages to Modernity'' by Dominic Janes, Gary Fredric Waller 2010 {{ISBN|0-7546-6924-6}} pages 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Québec debout''', sometimes styled '''Québec Debout''' ({{literal translation}} '''Stand Up, Quebec''' or '''Rise Up, Quebec'''), formerly the '''Groupe parlementaire québécois''' ({{literal translation|Quebec Parliamentary Group}}) was a Quebec-based [[parliamentary group]] in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] during the [[42nd Canadian Parliament]] which consisting of members that resigned from the [[Bloc Québécois]] caucus.&lt;ref name=deb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.journaldemontreal.com/2018/05/09/les-sept-demissionnaires-du-bloc-se-nommeront-quebec-debout|title=Les sept démissionnaires du Bloc se nommeront Québec Debout|date=May 9, 2018|work=Le Journal de Montréal|accessdate=2018-05-19|agency=Agence QMI|language=fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group did not have a formal leader, but [[Rhéal Fortin]] acted as the party's spokesperson.&lt;ref name=fortin&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hilltimes.com/2018/03/21/ex-bloc-mps-name-spokesperson-no-leader/138058|title=Ex-Bloc MPs name spokesperson, no leader - The Hill Times|date=2018-03-21|work=The Hill Times|accessdate=2018-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was dissolved on September 17, 2018 with all remaining Québec debout MPs rejoining the Bloc Québécois caucus.&lt;ref name=deboutBloc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bloc-mps-return-1.4826329|title=5 Bloc Québécois MPs who quit party returning to the fold|work=CBC News|date=September 17, 2018|accessdate=September 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation of the Groupe parlementaire québécois ==

The Groupe parlementaire québécois was formed on February 28, 2018 by seven [[Member of parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) who resigned from the caucus of the Bloc Québécois (BQ) due to their opposition to the leadership of [[Martine Ouellet]], as well as political differences with her strategy of emphasizing the party's stance regarding active advocacy for [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec sovereignty]] rather than a pragmatic approach that focuses on the practical interests of Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ballingall|first1=Alex|title=Seven of 10 Bloc Québécois MPs quit caucus in protest of leader Martine Ouellet|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/02/28/seven-of-10-bloc-quebecois-mps-quit-caucus-in-protest-of-leader-martine-ouellet.html|accessdate=March 2, 2018|work=Toronto Star|date=February 28, 2018|language=en-CA|quote=Hours later, the seven protesting MPs assembled in the House as independent members who now refer to themselves as the Groupe parlementaire Québécois.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grenier|first1=Éric|title=How the Bloc's split will affect the 2019 election|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-bloc-divide-1.4555592|accessdate=March 2, 2018|work=CBC News|date=March 1, 2018|language=en|quote=The seven MPs who left the party — reducing the Bloc to only three sitting members, fewer than the four seats the Bloc was left with after 2011 — will now sit as a 'Quebec Parliamentary Group'.

While the seven MPs left the BQ parliamentary caucus, they initially remained members of the BQ party itself and had expressed the desire to remain so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le Bloc Québécois refuse d'exclure les députés dissidents|url=http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/03/03/le-bloc-quebecois-refuse-dexclure-les-deputes-dissidents_a_23376164/|accessdate=March 7, 2018|work=HuffPost Québec|agency=The Canadian Press|date=March 3, 2018|language=fr-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BQ party executive, in a meeting one week after the group's formation, ruled that the seven defecting MPs would not be expelled from the party for leaving the caucus, and would be allowed to rejoin the caucus in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bloc Québécois national office rallies behind Martine Ouellet|url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/canada/bloc-quebecois-meets-to-discuss-fate-of-seven-mps-who-quit-over-leaders-style/wcm/771dd787-4bbd-4f05-86db-0d61b4af77bb|work=Montreal Gazette|agency=The Canadian Press|date=March 3, 2018|accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Ouellet's decision to resign after losing a [[leadership review]], [[Terrebonne (electoral district)|Terrebonne]] MP [[Michel Boudrias]] and [[Mirabel (electoral district)|Mirabel]] MP [[Simon Marcil]] announced that they would rejoin the Bloc Québécois caucus.&lt;ref name=Boudrias_Marcil&gt;{{cite news|title=Two of seven MPs who quit the Bloc Quebecois returning to the party|url=https://www.nationalnewswatch.com/2018/06/03/two-of-seven-mps-who-quit-the-bloc-quebecois-returning-to-the-party-2/#.WxgcrSAh3IV|accessdate=June 6, 2018|work=The Canadian Press|date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, citing the Bloc's vote to focus exclusively on Quebec sovereignty, Québec debout spokesman Rhéal Fortin announced that he and the party's other four MPs would not rejoin the Bloc Québécois.&lt;ref name=Boudrias_Marcil /&gt;

'''Roman villas in northwestern Gaul''' (modern [[France]]) functioned as colonial economic centers. Most villas did not resemble the luxurious, aristocratic country retreats of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean region]]. Their owners were absentee investors (or the emperor himself), managed by local Gauls whose families were rewarded after the Gallo-Roman wars.

It is difficult for archeologists to define a villa; the recovered residences varied in size and style (often determined by economic function). However, all sites designated as "villas" contain Roman architectural elements found in homes (such as [[mosaic]]s, [[portico]]s, columns and square grounds plans).

At first the new Roman masters physically changed very little in Gaul, simply refining the rural economic system in an already intensely farmed landscape. These refinements took the form of technological improvements and enhancing the economic structure (which included the transport of goods and raw materials to larger markets).
&lt;!-- Pre-Roman Gallic or Celtic Landscape. --&gt;

==Gauls (Celts)==
{{Main|Gauls|Gaul|Celts}}
The Gauls (Celts who lived in Gaul) were a culture rather than a race, nation or empire. They were skilled in metalworking and cattle-raising. The culture began to dominate France around 800 BCE, replacing the existing culture (but not the people).
[[File:Celts in III century BC.jpg|thumb|Celts in the third century BC|alt=Map of Europe, in two shades of green]]

The Celtic landscape resembled a countryside, with open fields instead of woods; however, Celtic fields were smaller (often square). More fields were used for pasture than for crops because of the need for cattle, sheep and forage. The Gauls intensely managed the forest for wood and forest products; the Romans enhanced the system without dramatically altering it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yorke|first=Trevor|title=Tracing the History of Villages|year=2001|publisher=Countryside Books|location=Newbury|isbn=1-85306-712-1|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Villages]] and [[hamlets]] were denser in the countryside during the Roman period; the population (equal to that at the time of [[Louis XIV]]) was about 20&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Yorke 2001, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, [[Roman Britain]]'s population of four to six million equaled later-medieval numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Yorke 2001, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Homes were better-constructed than most houses built during the [[Middle Ages]]; they were built with local materials: timber uprights with plaited wicker, coated with clay, straw and animal hair.&lt;ref&gt;Yorke 2001, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman conquest and colonization==
{{Main|Gallic Wars}}
[[Julius Caesar]] and his [[Roman legions]] succeeded in their [[conquest of Gaul]] from 57 to 52 BCE at the invitation of Gauls in [[Marseille]], who asked the Romans to come to their defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poëssel|first=A.E.|title=L'Orne et L'histoire|year=1989|publisher=Corlet|location=Condé-sur-Noireau|isbn=978-2-85480-237-5|page=59}}&lt;!-- given invalid isbn resolves on worldcat and french national library --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GallischeHoeve.jpg|thumb|Pre-Roman Gaul home|alt=Small house with large, overhanging pitched roof]]
The Romans occupied and managed their empire with a minimum of administrators, no [[police force]] and an army primarily located on the [[frontier]]s (much like the [[French colonial empire]] of the 17th and 18th centuries. A few Roman natives lived in major towns, but most governmental and economic functions were carried out by local Gauls. This "minimalist empire" left most people and institutions untouched. New Roman settlements were relatively few; if one paid their [[taxes]] and kept the peace, life did not change much during the early centuries of occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyson|first=Stephen L.|title=The Roman Countryside|year=2003|publisher=Duckworth Debates|location=London|isbn=0-7156-3225-6|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary early-Roman modifications were technological improvements and links to a [[market economy]], which often meant new [[Roman roads]] and supplies for the [[Roman army]]. The major technological addition was a bigger [[plough]] (possibly invented in Gaul), which could break up the heavier soil. This new plough cut deeper into the soil, and the ploughman could regulate its depth. It was usually pulled by four to eight [[oxen]], and had three parts:
* ''Coulter'': Knife-like vertical iron blade
* ''[[Ploughshare]]'': Blade which cut horizontally through grass roots
* ''[[Mouldboard]]'': Turned the soil to one side

The results of these innovations were longer fields (suitable for large estates) and population growth (with the additional food produced).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Hugh|title=World History: The Story of Mankind from Prehistory to the Present|year=1996|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=0-06-017477-3|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PSM V18 D469 Wheeled plough from the roman empire.jpg|thumb|left|Wheeled plough from the Roman Empire|alt=Drawing of simple, two-wheeled plow]]
Roman investors (possibly living in [[North Africa]]) bought and sold land, using local Gallic lords to manage the new [[villa]] system. These managers built the villas we find today, which historians call a ''[[romanitas]]'' (Romanized Gallic villa). These Gauls created a wide variety of homes, from two-room cottages to palaces more in keeping with the Roman ideal of life (evidenced in [[mosaics]], [[columns]] and other typically Roman features). This ''romanitas'' was the passport to a new world of consumer goods, prestige and advancement: urban luxury in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnston|first=David E.|title=Roman Villas|year=2004|publisher=Buckinghamshire|location=UK|isbn=0-7478-0600-4|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
Originally, historians believed Roman villas to be primarily near urban centers and major roads; their view of the villas stressed their economic autonomy, since transport over land was expensive and slow (even with the improvement of [[Roman roads]] throughout Gaul).

Today, scholars believe that the villas were linked to a broader empire economy through a system of secondary (and tertiary) Roman roads. These roads were sometimes built (or maintained) by villa owners, especially if the road crossed an owner's land. Owners often hired [[Construction surveying|surveyors]], [[geologists]] and [[labourers]] for the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rossi|first=Renzo|title=Life in a Roman Villa|year=1999|publisher=House of Shatus|location=Florence|isbn=1-84232-080-7|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Villa sites were places of previous occupation over hundreds (and possibly thousands) of years to reuse stone, water sources, raw materials and transportation links (roads and [[waterways]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donald|first=Elsie Burch|title=A la découverte des fermes de France|year=1995|publisher=Abbeville|location=Paris|isbn=2-87946-060-3|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-Roman Gaul, tribal areas were divided into parcels approximately the size of a [[parish]] (''pagi''). Each ''pagus'' usually had a village at its center, and sometimes [[Iron Age]] settlements relocated closer to a Roman road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnston|first=David E.|title=Roman Villas|year=2004|publisher=Shire Archaeology|location=Buckinghamshire|isbn=0-7478-0600-4|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An adequate water source was the primary site-location factor for a villa. Deep [[Water well|wells]] were often dug to ensure enough drinking and cleaning water for the family, laborers and livestock. Clean water was also essential for [[watermills]] and (eventually) baths, the Roman indicator of a fully civilized life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnston|first=David E.|title=Roman Villas|year=2004|publisher=Shire Archaeology Book|location=Buckinghamshire|isbn=0-7478-0600-4|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Archaeologists have had difficulties defining villas, since there were a number of local, regional and functional variations. Villa sizes ranged from two rooms to several acres (for rambling houses). The word "villa" sometimes refers to an architectural style with residential, urban Roman features such as [[portico]]s and columns.&lt;ref&gt;York 2001, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dyson 2003,p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most villas were food-production operations made up of cultivated fields, [[meadows]] and [[forest]], with timber use important. [[Watermills]], cowsheds, corn driers, [[wine cellar]]s and [[kilns]] were typical farm buildings. Villas produced wool, leather and tallow in addition to food. [[Hunting]], [[fowling]] and [[fishing]] were sources of protein.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2004, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Beef was important in northern France, and pork in the south; sheep were more common outside the villas.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson 2003, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The transport of produce overland was once thought to be too expensive, but [[amphorae]] and delicate [[Pottery|ceramics]] were carried across North Africa (causing archeologists to reconsider ancient logistics).&lt;ref&gt;Dyson 2003, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Romans used [[barges]] (towed up rivers by [[oxen]], [[horses]], or [[slaves]]) on the [[Rhone River]], it is unknown if the same system was used on the smaller rivers of Lower Normandy. Right-of-way would need to be secured by the state, and a clear riverside track would need to be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowell|first=F.R.|title=Everyday Life in Ancient Rome|year=1970|publisher=G.P.Putnam Sons|location=New York City, NY|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Roman villas engaged in industrial production in addition to food and other essentials. These included:&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;Johnston 2004, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tile works: The correct type of clay and a sizable forest (for fuel) were required. Most French forests in existence today existed during the Gallo-Roman period.&lt;ref name="Johnston" /&gt;
*Horse farms
*[[Health spa]]: Containing a large swimming pool (or bath)&lt;ref name="Johnston" /&gt;
*[[Salt works]]: On the coast, usually owned by the emperor
*Pottery kilns: Similar requirements to tile works, producing amphorae and mass-produced table and kitchenware (such as the popular red ware—''terra sigilata''—for long-distance trade. Local ceramics for cooking, eating and religious figurines were also produced for consumption.&lt;ref name="Johnston" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dyson 2003, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Stone quarry|Stone quarries]]ies: The hard work demanded [[slave labor]] (often criminals), requiring soldiers and tighter security.&lt;ref name="Dyson"&gt;Dyson 2003, p. 50-52.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mining]]: [[Precious metals]] were eventually controlled by the emperor. Community entrepreneurs or private associations controlled most other mines, but all mining (including quarries) was noted for its life-shortening slave work. Most mines were short-lived, located near small villages.&lt;ref name="Dyson" /&gt;
*Imperial estates: The [[civil service]] or the army administered the emperor’s villas.&lt;ref name="Johnston_a"&gt;Johnston 2004, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

All villas paid predetermined income and inheritance taxes (''tributum'') in cash. Materials sold to the army (most commonly leather and corn), were processed on-site. The results were then sent through the empire’s posting stations (''mansion'') to the northern frontier.&lt;ref name="Johnston_a" /&gt; All industrial villas bought food, iron for tools, wood and other materials locally, hiring local labor.&lt;ref name="Johnston_a" /&gt;

==Labor==
[[Slave]]-based villas existed in large numbers (especially after the wars of conquest), but were not dominant; [[free peasants]] and [[tenant farmers]] working for villas were common as well.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson 2003,p.46.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary source of slaves was war, but abandoned-property owners were also rounded up and treated as slaves.&lt;ref name="Johnston_b"&gt;Johnston 2004,p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaves were considered expensive assets, and treated accordingly. Sometimes several hundred slaves served a medium-sized villa. They were treated as thinking, self-motivated “instruments” with a variety of skills. Owners were firm but tolerant, admonishing and encouraging with small rewards. Women specialized in a number of jobs: [[cook (domestic worker)|cooks]], [[hairdressers]], [[weaver (occupation)|weaver]]s and laundresses.&lt;ref&gt;Rossi 1999,p.22.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Roman collared slaves - Ashmolean Museum.jpg|thumb|Roman slaves and free laborers were used on villa estates.|alt=Relief wall sculpture of three slaves collared together]]

After periods of political upheaval, a father’s job legally bound his son to the same work.&lt;ref name="Johnston_b" /&gt; The Roman institution of slavery in the empire also provided other options. Many were freed for good service, an incentive. There were also opportunities to earn bonuses and buy freedom. A promising young slave might attend the children’s lessons; an owner could cultivate his own [[secretaries]], [[accountants]], [[administrator (business)|administrator]]s, and [[tutors]] and rent them out. The emperor's slaves were insiders in the wealth system, and could become wealthy themselves.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;Thomas 1996,p.106.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the second century BCE, 80 percent of the population consisted of emancipated slaves or their descendants. After the wars of expansion, as the slave pool dried up villas converted to tenant or employed laborers. By the end of the empire most slaves worked in [[domestic worker|domestic service]] as the owners’ private staff, rather than as laborers on the estates.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;

==Architecture==
Over five centuries, the villa took on many forms. It sometimes began as a simple [[cottage]], which became embedded in a complex of additions; large investor colonial villas were also designed and built, fully formed. Near the empire’s end, villas became smaller and more numerous.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2004,p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

The classic great villa consisted of a main house with a [[veranda]] (or [[porch]]) overlooking two rows of buildings (or wings). These were often not parallel, diverging to enhance the effect of distance. The rooms were connected by the veranda, which acted as a [[hall]]. Each room had a different function, and all offered little privacy. Some villas were several rooms deep and lit by a [[clerestory]], or dormer windows. Thick walls indicate villas which could have been two or three [[Storey|stories]] tall, with [[attics]] for storage.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2004,p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[fireplaces]] with hoods have been found, most heating was by braziers burning [[charcoal]] or [[coal]]. Rarely, a central room was heated by [[hypocausts]] (under-floor hot air from fires beneath the house). The venting ran up the walls of the villa, emptying under the roof eaves. This source of venting made the home appear to be on fire because of the smoke billowing from the roof edges and walls.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2004,p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kitchens]] were unsophisticated, featuring a masonry hearth with a [[charcoal]] fire. Coals would have been scraped into a pile, and a portable [[grilling|grill]] would hold a pot to simmer or grill meat. Kitchens were often near baths, since both required water; they were detached (or at the end of a building) due to the risk of fire. Some kitchen fireplace ovens used [[refractory brick]], which allowed heat to be gradually released into an adjoining room (a library, study or storage room for drying split wood or wine being artificially aged). Kitchen ceilings were high, again to reduce the fire risk.&lt;ref name="Johnston_c"&gt;Johnston 2004,p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rossi 1999,p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Roman Museum 048.jpg|thumb|left|Reconstructed Roman kitchen ([[Roman Museum]], [[Canterbury]])|alt=Kitchen corner, with pottery and basket]]
[[Latrines|Lavatories]] were used in towns, but not at villas since trees provided privacy. Rubbish was discarded out the window or into pits.&lt;ref name="Johnston_c" /&gt; Walls (interior and exterior) and columns might be painted in bright colors, such as red, purple, brown or white. Roof tiles could be a bright sky-blue from the clay-baking process. Painted wall murals rarely survive, but were popular.&lt;ref name="Johnston_d"&gt;Johnston 2004,p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one [[mosaic]] appears in all villas, usually on the floor in public areas (and especially in dining rooms by the empire’s end). Set in hard [[Roman cement]] and buried under collapsed debris, thousands have been found throughout northern Europe. Simple mosaics consisted of a [[geometric pattern]], but an enormous range of cultural and artistic aspects of Roman life were also portrayed (including interpretations of [[classical literature]] and [[Roman mythology]]).&lt;ref name="Johnston_d" /&gt;

Furniture was sparse by modern standards: a [[cupboard]], [[sideboard]] and an [[occasional table]] were set along the walls, and brought out when needed. Beds were simple frames. During the late empire, dining was on reclining couches set in threes. Most rooms were square, with chairs and a small table.&lt;ref name="Johnston_d" /&gt; Increased wealth was spent not on more furniture, but better-quality pieces.&lt;ref name="Cowell"&gt;Cowell 1970,p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most distinct structure at the villa was the [[Roman bath]], its architectural showpiece: warm, noisy, clean and lavishly decorated. There were two types: [[Spartan bath|Spartan]], with high-temperature [[sauna]]-style dry heat and a “[[Turkish bath|Turkish]]” (moist heat) version with plunge baths. A well-equipped bath would provide both, with the bather entering an unheated room to undress and going into a warm room, a warmer room and a hot bath (perhaps including massage) followed by cleansing. Cleansing was done not with soap, but [[olive oil]] scraped off with a [[bronze]] tool known as a [[strigil]]. Cleansing was followed by a cold plunge bath.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2004,p.33.&lt;/ref&gt; Lighting for the baths came through narrow [[lancet windows]]. Rarely, pale [[green glass]] (glazed or held by crossbars) has been found in windows.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2004,p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Personal lighting came from hand-carried [[oil lamps]]. Some lamps had multiple wicks, providing more light but consuming more [[olive oil]]. An oil lamp was capable of burning for 40 to 50 hours.&lt;ref name="Cowell" /&gt;

On the outside of the villa, hinged wooden shutters protected windows. Walls were rendered or exposed timber and frame. Roofs were made from [[thatch]], [[tile]], stone, [[terra cotta]] or a combination, with occasional stone [[finials]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2004,p.35&lt;/ref&gt; Flower [[gardens]] decorated the villas, resembling ordered patches of [[wild flowers]]. These gardens were considered necessary for festivals, family altars and banquets. Common flowers were [[rosa (plant)|roses]], [[violet (plant)|violet]]s, [[lilies]], [[narcissus (plant)|narcissus]], [[sunflowers]], [[carnations]], [[hyacinths]], [[Common Bluebell|bluebell]]s and [[snapdragons]].&lt;ref name="Rossi"&gt;Rossi 1999,p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetable gardens were laid out in beds, yielding [[lettuce]], [[cabbage]], [[leeks]], [[beans]] and [[radishes]]. Fruits consisted of [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[cherries]], [[Common fig|fig]]s, [[almond]]s and [[plum]]s.&lt;ref name="Rossi" /&gt;

Most villas had an aisled barn (rarely two), storing equipment and produce rather than animals. Archeologists have found evidence in these barns of corn drying, metalwork and communal kitchens. The barns may have been partitioned, since workers often slept where they worked.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2004,p.39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Roman villas illustrate the [[Christianization]] of Europe, since the country villa served as "pieces of cities broken off" and Christianity originated as an urban religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fletcher|first=Robert|title=The Barbarian Conversion from Paganism to Christianity|year=1998|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-8050-2763-7|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Galois aristocrats benefited from conversion by closer ties to Rome (and the emperor's family) after Constantine’s conversion. Roman culture was flexible, so a multicultural blend (or sympathetic intermingling) was usually the result with many villas religiously ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 2004, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The local peasants (and their pagan traditions) were ignored; pre-Roman religious sites evolved into Roman cult sites and (later) Christian pilgrimage destinations.&lt;ref name="Dyson_a" /&gt; Because the church kept all records throughout the fall of Rome and the Middle Ages, historians have little information about local non-Christian beliefs.&lt;ref name="Dyson_a"&gt;Dyson 2003, p.79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since historians only know in general terms about [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic religion]], archeology provides additional information. Peasants on the villa estates observed a complex [[polytheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher 1998,p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Gallo-Roman religion]] considered [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] (known as [[Lugh|Lug]] by the Gauls) the chief god, there were many [[nature gods]] and goddesses for war, thunder, trees and youth. Earth goddesses were [[Divona]] (water), [[Onuava]] (earth) and [[Epona]] (horses and fertility).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=John|title=The Religions of the Roman Empire|year=1991|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=0-8014-9311-0|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Villa managers and owners were dependent on local labor. The aristocrats paid lip service to country life with its sturdy virtues, health and innocent pleasures; however, they also felt disdain (mingled with fear) for [[peasants]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher 1998,p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter have always faced forces beyond their control, seeking to improve and influence their situation with religious acts. Villa owners sometimes created religious sites on their estates as a destination for [[pilgrimages]], but most were abandoned during the Christian era. [[Aerial photography]] has confirmed [[pagan]] temples in high-villa-density areas by their distinctive square shape (with over 40 in [[Picardy]] alone).&lt;ref&gt;Dyson 2003, p.81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution and decline==
As the central empire declined, villas became more self-sufficient and less part of a larger market economy. At the same time, a greater number of smaller villas appeared, exhibiting Roman culture and values. As Rome waned, the provinces waxed at first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davies|first=Norman|title=Europe: A History|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-520912-5|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2004,p.21.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 235 AD (the death of Emperor [[Severus Alexander]]) a series of short-lived, sometime incompetent emperors ruled Rome. They generally died violently, after serving for an average of 2.6 years. The high turn-over represents the attempt to find a leader who could deal with the challenges facing the empire. Generals Postumus and Tetricu in Gaul established a separate 'Gallic' Empire 260-274 in response to an invasion of tribes in 259 which reached as far south as Tarrgona in Spain since the legitimate emperor in Rome was too pressed to respond. [[Bubonic plague]] (or [[malaria]]) may have swept the provinces, and villa owners feared bandit armies. A manpower shortage meant that fewer people were paying taxes.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;Fletcher 1998,p. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; Some continental villa investors may have moved their holdings to [[Roman Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2004,p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;. The Empire actually did not have a budget in the modern sense until Diocletian, 284-305. The authorities resorted to forced requisition to meet needs.From 257 CE to 276 CE began the first series of [[barbarian invasions]] pillaging the countryside. These outsiders sensed the disorganization of the Imperial armies on the frontier, and took advantage of the [[power vacuum]]:&lt;ref name="Fletcher" /&gt;

}}

Roman rulers debased the currency to pay the armies, creating  enormous [[inflation]]. Arbitrary requisitions on rural population caused many to flee the anarchic conditions.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;Fletcher 1998,p. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the early fourth century, more villas appeared to be uninhabited; coins and datable pottery become rare in the archaeological record. The [[market economy]] survived, unpredictably, in some parts of Gaul. During this time, archaeologists have found more wooden, temporary construction on villa grounds; some villas added fortifications.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson 2003,p.93.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent, nuanced view is that although massacre sites at villas have been found, most barbarian newcomers arrived with [[sickle]] rather than [[sword]]; they wanted to be [[settlers]]. Backed by armed [[garrisons]] living nearby, the new occupiers moved in and dominated politically and culturally. By the early fifth century all villas seemed abandoned as residences; however, archeologists have found small homes built next to the large houses. Some villas seem to have served as [[cemeteries]]. [[Pollen analyses]] for this period found no drop in crops, indicating that the population largely remained in place and sustained itself.&lt;ref&gt;Dyson 2003,p.95-96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2004,p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole region between the Alps and the Pyrenees, the ocean and the Rhine suffered considerable damage. It took some decades to recover, however Gaul even in the north recovered some of its prosperity especially in the southern half of the country where numerous massive villas are attested.  The beginning of the end of Roman Gaul came as a result of the invasions of tribes in 407 who eventually went to Spain in 409. However, the failure to control or remove the Visigoths in the southwest, the Burgundians in Savoy and the Franks in Belgium resulted in the end of Roman control post 455 (the assassination of Valentinian III opened the flood gates).   

In 472-475 CE, the Roman Empire lost control of its remaining provinces in southern Gaul to the Visigoths. In the north the last rulers claiming to be Roman were defeated by the Franks in 486. In 470 CE a mass migration to [[Brittany]] from Britain occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2004,p.52.&lt;/ref&gt; There was continuity from the Roman villa culture and economy.&lt;ref name="Thomas_a"&gt;Thomas 1996,p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Today}}Modern era==
The size and shape of Roman estates did not change from Roman to Frankish occupation; [[parish]] or [[commune]] boundaries remained from Roman and (probably pre-Roman) times.&lt;ref name="Thomas_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yorke 2001,p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Christians willed their villas to the church in Spain, which may have also happened in France. Some of these became [[monasteries]]; [[Church (building)|church]]es often occupied villa sites in the countryside as well.&lt;ref&gt;Yorke 2001,p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The suffix  "-[[ville]]" is thought to derive from ''villa'', and place names often derived from the villa name. From the eighth to the twelfth centuries, [[Normans|Norman]] [[agglomerations]] in France began to acquire names. The prefix ''ville'' indicates a rural name; the suffix usually occurred in urban names (meaning the domain of a family's name). Most of this naming was done between the 10th and 11th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lepelley|first=Rene|title=Noms de lieux de Normandie|year=1999|publisher=Bonneton|location=Paris|isbn=2-86253-247-9|pages=20–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A good way to see Roman Gaul is from the sky. Fields may be seen in a rectangular system, with walls and foundations evident. However, without an archeological dig it is often difficult to date artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muir|first=Richard|title=Landscape Encyclopaedia|year=2004|publisher=Windgather Press|location=Bollinton UK|isbn=0-9545575-1-4|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10741">[[File:Hierarchical Model Mental Lexicon.png|thumb|A visual representation of a Semantic Lexicon]]
A '''semantic lexicon''' is a digital [[dictionary]] of [[word]]s labeled with [[semantics|semantic]] classes so associations can be drawn between words that have not previously been encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Research on Digital Libraries: Design, Development, and Impact|last=Theng|first=Yin-Leng|publisher=Information Science Reference|year=2009|isbn=9781599048796|location=University of Michigan|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semantic lexicons are built upon [[semantic network]]s, which represent the semantic relations between words. The difference between a semantic lexicon and a semantic network is that a semantic lexicon has definitions for each word, or a "gloss".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wordnet.princeton.edu/|title=About WordNet|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Semantic lexicons are made up of lexical entries. These entries are not orthographic, but semantic, eliminating issues of homonymy and polysemy. These lexical entries are interconnected with [[Ontology components|semantic relations]], such as hyperonymy, hyponymy, meronymy, or troponymy. Synonymous entries are grouped together in what the Princeton [[WordNet]] calls "[[WordNet|synsets]]"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most semantic lexicons are made up of four different "sub-nets":&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, though some researchers have taken steps to add an "artificial node" interconnecting the sub-nets.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lemnitzer|first=L.|date=|title=Enriching GermaNet: a case study of lexical acquisition|url=|journal=Seminar fur Sprachwissenschaft, Universitat Tubingen|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nouns===
Nouns are ordered into a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], structured into a hierarchy where the broadest and most encompassing noun is located at the top, such as "thing", with the nouns becoming more and more specific the further they are form the top. The very top noun in a semantic lexicon is called a ''unique beginner''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyd-Graber|first=J.|date=2006|title=Adding Dense, Weighted Connections to WordNet|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Third International Wordnet Conference|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most specific nouns (those that do not have any subordinates), are ''terminal nodes''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Semantic lexicons also distinguish between types, where a type of something has characteristics of a thing such as a ''Rhodesian Ridgeback'' being a type of dog, and instances, where something is an example of said thing, such as ''[[Dave Grohl]]'' is an instance of a ''musician''. Instances are always terminal nodes because they are solitary and don’t have other words or [[ontological categories]] belonging to them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Semantic lexicons also address [[meronymy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hinrichs|first=E.|date=December 2012|title=Using part-whole relations for automatic deduction of compound-international relations in GermaNet|url=|journal=[[International Journal on Semantic Web and Information Systems]]|volume=3|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a “part-to-whole” relationship, such as keys are part of a laptop. The necessary attributes that define a specific entry are also necessarily present in that entry’s [[Hyponymy and hypernymy|hyponym]]. So, if a ''computer'' has ''keys'', and a ''laptop'' is a type of ''computer'', then a ''laptop'' must have ''keys''. However, there are many instances where this distinction can become vague. A good example of this is the item ''chair''. Most would define a chair as having legs and a seat (as in the part one sits on). However, there are some very “artistic” and “modern” chairs in overpriced boutiques that do not have legs at all. Beanbags also do not have legs, but few would argue that they aren't chairs. Questions like this are the core questions that drive research and work in the fields of [[Ontology (information science)|taxonomy]] and [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]].

===Verbs===
Verb synsets are arranged much like their noun counterparts: the more general and encompassing verbs are near the top of the hierarchy while [[Toponymy|troponyms]] (verbs that describe a more specific way of doing something) are grouped beneath. Verb specificity moves along a [[Word embedding|vector]], with the verbs becoming more and more specific in reference to a certain quality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example. The set "walk / run / sprint" becomes more specific in terms of the speed, and "dislike / hate / abhor" becomes more specific in terms of the intensity of the emotion.

The ontological groupings and separations of verbs is far more arguable than their noun counterparts. It is widely accepted that a ''dog'' is a type of ''animal'' and that a ''stool'' is a type of ''chair'', but it can be argued that ''abhor'' is on the same emotional plane as ''hate'' (that they are synonyms and not super/subordinates). It can also be argued that ''love'' and ''adore'' are synonyms, or that one is more specific than the other. Thus, the relations between verbs are not as agreed-upon as that of nouns.

Another attribute of verb synset relations is that there are also ordered into verb pairs. In these pairs, one verb necessarily [[Entailment (pragmatics)|entails]] the other in the way that ''massacre'' entails ''kill'', and ''know'' entails ''believe''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These verb pairs can be troponyms and their superordinates, as is the case in the first example, or they can be in completely different ontological categories, as in the case in the second example.

=== Adjectives ===
Adjective synset relations are very similar to verb synset relations. They are not quite as neatly hierarchical as the noun synset relations, and they have fewer tiers and more terminal nodes. However, there are generally less terminal nodes per ontological category in adjective synset relations than that of verbs. Adjectives in semantic lexicons are organized in word pairs as well, with the difference being that their word pairs are [[Opposite (semantics)|antonyms]] instead of [[Entailment (pragmatics)|entailments]]. More generic polar adjectives such as ''hot'' and ''cold'', or ''happy'' and ''sad'' are paired. Then other adjectives that are semantically similar are linked to each of these words. ''Hot'' is linked to ''warm'', ''heated'', ''sizzling'', and ''sweltering'', while ''cold'' is linked to ''cool'', ''chilly'', ''freezing'', and ''nippy''. These semantically similar adjectives are considered ''indirect antonyms''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to the opposite polar adjective (i.e. ''nippy'' is an indirect antonym to ''hot''). Adjectives that are derived from a verb or a noun are also directly linked to said verb or noun across sub-nets. For example, ''enjoyable'' is linked to the semantically similar adjectives ''agreeable'', and ''pleasant'', as well as to its origin verb, ''enjoy''.

=== Adverbs ===
There are very few adverbs accounted for in semantic lexicons. This is because most adverbs are taken directly from their adjective counterparts, in both meaning and form, and changed only [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] (i.e. ''happily'' is derived from ''happy'', and ''luckily'' is derived from ''lucky'', which is derived from ''luck''). The only adverbs that are accounted for specifically are ones without these connections, such as ''really'', ''mostly'', and ''hardly''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Challenges facing semantic lexicons ==
The effects of the Princeton [[WordNet]] project extend far past English, though most research in the field revolves around the English language. Creating a semantic lexicon for other languages has proved to be very useful for [[Natural language processing|Natural Language Processing]] applications. One of the main focuses of research in semantic lexicons is linking lexicons of different languages to aid in [[machine translation]]. The most common approach is to attempt to create a shared ontology that serves as a “middleman” of sorts between semantic lexicons of two different languages.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fellbaum|first=C.|date=May 2012|title=Challenges for a Multilingual Wordnet|url=|journal=Language Resources and Evaluation|volume=46|pages=313–326}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an extremely challenging and as-of-yet unsolved issue in the Machine Translation field. One issue arises from the fact that no two languages are word-for-word translations of each other. That is, every language has some sort of structural or syntactic difference from every other. In addition, languages often have words that don’t translate easily into other languages, and certainly not with an exact word-to-word match. Proposals have been made to create a set framework for wordnets. Research has shown that every known human language has some sort of concept resembling [[synonym]]y, [[Hyponymy and hypernymy|hyponymy]], [[meronymy]], and [[Opposite (semantics)|antonymy]]. However, every idea so far proposed has been met with criticism for using a pattern that works best for English and less for other languages.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Another obstacle in the field is that no solid guidelines exist for semantic lexicon framework and contents. Each lexicon project in each different language has had a slightly (or not so slightly) different approach to their wordnet. There is not even an agreed-upon definition of what a “word” is. [[Orthography|Orthographically]], they are defined as a string of letters with spaces on either side, but semantically it becomes a very debated upon subject. For example, though it is not difficult to define ''dog'' or ''rod'' as words, but what about ''guard dog'' or ''lightning rod''? The latter two examples would be considered orthographically separate words, though semantically they make up one concept: one is a type of dog and one is a type of rod. In addition to these confusions, wordnets are also [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]], in that they do not consistently label items. They are redundant, in that they often have several words assigned to each meaning (synsets). They are also open-ended, in that they often focus on and extend into [[terminology]] and domain-specific vocabulary.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3051">Sequence Dating''', a [[relative dating]] method, allows assemblages to be arranged in a rough serial order, which is then taken to indicate time. '''Sequence dating is a method of [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] developed by the [[egyptology|Egyptologist]] Sir [[William Matthew Flinders Petrie]]. By linking styles of [[pottery]] with different time periods, he was able to establish the relative chronology of the site.'''

Sir Flinders Petrie (1853–1942) was the first to use [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] in Egyptology. Sir Flinders Petrie, the younger contemporary of archaeologist Augustus Pitt-Rivers, was meticulous in his excavations and recorded every artifact and detail on site. From his work, Petrie was able to bring chronological order to 2,200 pit graves of the Naqada cemetery in Upper Egypt.

The sequence dating method allowed the relative date, if not the absolute date, of any given [[Predynastic Egypt]] site to be ascertained by examining the handles on pottery, general form of the piece, and the stratigraphic layer it was found in. As more evidence of the predynastic period is uncovered, this dating method in relation to the pottery on site aids in determining the relative date of the site.

'''Types of [[Seriation (archaeology)|Seriation]]'''

'''Contextual:''' developed by Flinders Petrie, created sequences of assemblages and arranged them in what he thought was their chronological order based on the inventory of grave contents, his work in Egypt proved this to be a generally true reflection of their chronological sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bahn &amp; Renfew|title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods, and Practice. 5th edition.|year=2008|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frequency:''' measures changes in abundance of a certain ceramic style. Developed by W.S. Robinson and G.W. Brainerd. Created because of artifacts in Mayan sites had been recovered in the 1940s without stratigraphic context. The assumption was that certain styles of pottery were popular in certain times, and during that time, the popularity would reach a peak and then fade away. So, if a similar style of pottery was found at a different site, they must be from around the same time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bahn &amp; Renfew|title=Archaeology: Theories, Methods, and Practice. 5th edition.|year=2008|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European strategy would eventually makes its way into Americanist archaeology during the late 19th century, but it would not be until the second decade of the 20th century that sequence and detail became a part and parcel of archaeology method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O M. J &amp; Lyman|title= Seriation, stratigraphy, and index fossils: The backbone of archaeological dating}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sequence dating has been deemed an obsolete and inaccurate method of dating archeological sites and artifacts, since archaeologists have discovered more precise methods of dating archeological sites and artifacts.

[[File:Fridolin Leiber - Schutzengel.jpg|thumb|A [[guardian angel]] in a 19th-century print]]
A '''shoulder angel''' is a [[plot device]] used for dramatic and/or humorous effect in fiction, mainly in [[animation]] and [[comic books]]/[[Comic strip|strips]]. The [[angel]] represents [[conscience]] and is often accompanied by a '''shoulder [[devil]]''' representing [[temptation]]. They are a useful convention for depicting the inner conflict of a character.

== Iconography ==
The shoulder angel often uses the [[iconography]] of a traditional [[angel]], with wings, a robe, a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and sometimes a harp. The shoulder devil likewise usually looks like a traditional devil with reddish skin, horns, [[Fish hook|barbed]] tail, a [[pitchfork]] or,  more precisely, a [[trident]] and in some cases, [[Cloven-hoof|cloven hooves]].  Often, both resemble their host, though sometimes they will resemble other characters in the story who are responsible or mischievous. In Western culture the idea develops the Christian concept of a personal [[guardian angel]], who was sometimes considered to be matched by a personal devil who countered the angel's efforts. Especially in popular [[medieval drama]]s, like the 15th century ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]''. In both this and [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s  play ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]'', of about 1592, the "Good Angel" and "Bad Angel" offer competing advice (Act 2, scene 1, etc.) to the hero.

== Origins ==
The non-canonical [[early Christian]] book, ''[[The Shepherd of Hermas]]'', of around A.D. 140–150,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/shepherd.html Earlychristianwritings.com]&lt;/ref&gt; has a reference to the idea of two angels: "There are two angels with a man—one of righteousness, and the other of iniquity".&lt;ref&gt;Sixth commandment, chapter 2, ''[[The Shepherd of Hermas]]''&lt;/ref&gt; These angels in turn descend into a person's heart, and attempt to guide a person's emotions. Hermas is told to understand both angels, but to only trust the Angel of Righteousness. The concept is similar to ideas of personal [[tutelary deity|tutelary spirits]] that are very common in many ancient and traditional cultures.

In some [[Christian folklore]], each person has a dedicated [[guardian angel]] whose task is to follow the person and try to prevent them from coming to harm, both physical and moral.  At the same time each person is assailed by devils, not usually considered as single and dedicated to a single person in the same way as the guardian angel, who try to tempt the person into [[sin]].  Both angels and devils are often regarded as having the ability to access the person's thoughts, and introduce ideas.

There is a similar [[Islam]]ic belief of [[Kiraman Katibin]], two angels residing on either shoulder of humans which record their good and bad deeds.  However, these angels do not have influence over the choices one makes, and only record one's deeds. However, there is a concept much similar to the shoulder angel and devil: the [[qareen]], which, according to Islamic literature, is a personal companion, and there are two with each individual, one from the angels and another from the [[jinn]]. The word ''qarīn'' literally means 'constant companion'. The angel pushes the individual to do good and obey God while that from the jinn does the opposite.

In [[Japanese Buddhism]], the Kushoujin are a pair of beings – Domyo, meaning "same name" and Dosho, meaning "same birth" – which sit on a person's shoulders, observing and reporting all his deeds. Domyo records good deeds, but Dosho reports bad ones.

== Modern representations ==
[[File:Dog's guardian angel retouch.png|thumb|Modern cartoon]]
In several modern fictional stories, a character can be marked as especially evil or mischievous by receiving similarly bad advice from both shoulder figures, having a second shoulder devil instead of the angel, or being persuaded by the devil to kick the angel out.

One may view this image in [[Freudian]] terms, with the Angel representing the [[Super-ego]] (the source of self-censorship), counterbalanced by the Devil representing the Id (the primal, instinctive desires of the individual), which leaves the individual in question as the Ego.

The Disney animated film ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', its sequel ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'', and the animated series ''[[The Emperor's New School]]'' feature the concept of shoulder angels and devils, most notably in the character of Kronk. His appear at various points of moral crisis in the franchise for Kronk, but often spend more time antagonizing each other than actually trying to take Kronk down one path or another. The Oscar-winning Disney short ''[[Lend a Paw]]'' also featured [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]] being influenced by a shoulder angel and devil, and [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] has similar manifestations—though simply colored white and red rather than depicted with wings and a halo/horns and a pitchfork, respectively-in episodes of ''[[Mickey Mouse Clubhouse]].''

The film ''[[Cloud Atlas (film)|Cloud Atlas]]'' is an example of utilizing a shoulder angel plot device in feature film, in which the character of [[Hugo Weaving]] whispers bad and good advice to the character of [[Tom Hanks]]. Old Georgie (Hugo Weaving) appears only in critical points of the story, where Zachry's mind (Tom Hanks) is split between right and wrong choices.

[[BYUtv]]'s sketch comedy series ''[[Studio C]]'' makes use of the concept in several sketches, with the physical comedy aspect of the angel or devil-a full-sized being played by an actor-having to physically climb up onto the shoulder of the one they are attempting to influence for good or evil.

It is speculated that the two main protagonists of [[Neil Gaiman]] and [[Terry Pratchett|Terry Pratchett's]] ''[[Good Omens]]'' are supposed to represent the angel and demon on your shoulder as the Demon Anthony J. Crowley tempts people into sin/ baser nature while his counter figure the Angel Aziraphale encourages people to do good and rise above their baser instincts, however neither forces people into following their examples allowing free will to be exercised unimpeded.

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Whacking Day]]", Homer presents the concept that everyone has a good and a bad self to Lisa, who then imagines Homer's evil version dancing on the grave of good Homer while singing 'I am Evil Homer, I am Evil Homer', implying that within him the battle for good and evil has long ago been won by his bad angel.

== In modern media ==
In the [[Discworld]] novel ''[[Night Watch (Discworld)|Nightwatch]]'' by [[Terry Pratchett]] the killer Carcer was considered by the hero [[Sam Vimes|Samuel Vimes]] to have a demon on each shoulder rather than an angel and a demon, but not opposing each other, just in competition to urge Carcer on to worse deeds.  It was said that if Vimes looked deep into Carcer's eyes, he could see the demons looking back.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comics used this concept in at least two stories. In ''[[The Red Sea Sharks]]'', [[Captain Haddock]]'s good and bad angels try to convince him to drink a bottle of whisky.  The bad one is able to convince him, but the bottle smashes before he is able to drink it, leaving the good angel victorious.  In ''[[Tintin in Tibet]]'', Snowy is tempted by his demon to lap up Captain Haddock's whiskey leaking from his rucksack or enjoy a huge bone rather than deliver a vital message.  His good angel loses the argument, leaving in tears, and he gnaws the bone while the message blows away.  Realizing his mistake, Snowy makes amends by reaching a local monastery and brings the monks to help.
In both examples, the angels resemble good or bad versions of their subject, with horns and angel wings.

[[Sluggy Freelance]] comics has made use of this theme, with all three of the main characters: Riff, Torg and Zoe, who have been shown debating with their shoulder angels and demons.  Despite being good and bad they both still reflect aspects of their owner - both Riff's are unwilling to commit to a course of action saying 'don't know' when asked for guidance.  Torg's angel and demon are both childish while Zoe has her bad demon dressed in revealing outfit, while her good one wishes she could dress in the same fashion.

''[[Angel on My Shoulder (film)|Angel on My Shoulder]]'' is a 1946 American [[fantasy film]] about a deal between the [[Devil]] and a dead man.

'''Stendhal syndrome''', '''Stendhal's syndrome''', '''hyperkulturemia''', or '''Florence syndrome''' is a [[psychosomatic]] disorder that causes [[Tachycardia|rapid heartbeat]], dizziness, [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]], confusion and even [[hallucination]]s when an individual is exposed to an experience of great personal significance, particularly viewing [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bcr.06.2008.0317| title = Stendhal syndrome: A case of cultural overload| journal = Case Reports| volume = 2009| pages = bcr0620080317| year = 2009| last1 = Nicholson | first1 = T.

==History==
[[File:Stendhal.jpg|thumb|upright|Stendhal syndrome was named after Marie-Henri Beyle (1783–1842), better known by his penname [[Stendhal]].]]
The illness is named after the 19th-century French author [[Stendhal]] (pseudonym of Marie-Henri Beyle), who described his experience with the phenomenon during his 1817 visit to [[Florence]] in his book ''Naples and Florence: A Journey from Milan to Reggio''.

When he visited the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce]], where [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Galileo Galilei]] are buried, he was overcome with emotion. He wrote:{{quote|I was in a sort of ecstasy, from the idea of being in Florence, close to the great men whose tombs I had seen. Absorbed in the contemplation of sublime beauty ... I reached the point where one encounters celestial sensations ... Everything spoke so vividly to my soul. Ah, if I could only forget. I had palpitations of the heart, what in Berlin they call 'nerves'. Life was drained from me. I walked with the fear of falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=OxyNfsmXfYEC&amp;pg=PA196 | title=Interfaces of Performance | editor-first1=Maria |editor-last1= Chatzichristodoulou | editor-first2=Janis |editor-last2= Jefferies |editor-first3=Rachel |editor-last3= Zerihan | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year= 2009 |page= 196 |isbn= 9781409486145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He had been shown the frescoes in the church including those by [[Giotto]], and modern writers frequently attribute his emotions mistakenly to the latter rather than powerful historical associations of the tombs. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Although psychiatrists have long debated whether it really exists, its effects on some sufferers are serious enough for them to require treatment in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/15/world/florence-s-art-makes-some-go-to-pieces.html |title=Florence's Art Makes Some Go to Pieces |location=Italy; Florence (Italy) |work=The New York Times |date=15 May 1989 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff at Florence's Santa Maria Nuova hospital are accustomed to dealing with tourists suffering from dizzy spells and disorientation after admiring the statue of David, the masterpieces of the Uffizi Gallery and other treasures of the Tuscan city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/7914746/Scientists-investigate-Stendhal-Syndrome-fainting-caused-by-great-art.html |title=Scientists investigate Stendhal Syndrome – fainting caused by great art |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though there are many descriptions of people becoming dizzy and fainting while taking in Florentine art, especially at the aforementioned [[Uffizi]] in Florence, dating from the early 19th century on, the syndrome was only named in 1979, when it was described by Italian psychiatrist [[Graziella Magherini]], who observed and described more than 100 similar cases among tourists and visitors in Florence. There is no scientific evidence to define the Stendhal syndrome as a specific psychiatric disorder; on the other hand there is evidence that the same cerebral areas involved in emotional reactions are activated during the exposure to artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |last1=Innocenti |first1=Claudia |last2=Fioravanti |first2=Giulia |last3=Spiti |first3=Raffaello |last4=Faravelli |first4=Carlo |title=La sindrome di Stendhal fra psicoanalisi e neuroscienze |journal=Rivista di Psichiatria |date=1 March 2014 |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=61–66  |doi=10.1708/1461.16139|pmid=24770571 |issn=2038-2502  |trans-title=[The Stendhal syndrome between psychoanalysis and neuroscience]. |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use Indian English|date=March 2017}}

[[Sangam literature]] is one of the main sources used for documenting the early history of the [[ancient Tamil country]]. The ancient [[Sangam literature|Sangam]] poems mention numerous kings and princes, the existence of some of whom have been confirmed through archaeological evidence. Sangam literature is still the main source for the [[early Cholas]], the [[Pandyas]] and the [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]].

==Age of Sangam==
{{main|Sangam period}}     
'''Sangam''' was the ancient academy, which enabled [[Tamil language|Tamil]] poets and authors to gather periodically to publish their work. The Sangam met periodically in the city of [[Madurai]] in [[South India]] under the patronage of the [[Pandya]] kings. The current estimate is that the Sangam period lasted between 400 BCE until 300 CE. The earliest mention of the Sangam is to be found in the 8th century commentary on the ''Irayanar Agapporul''. It mentions three Sangams lasting, at long intervals, for a total of 9990 years.

Sangam literature comprises some of the oldest extant [[Tamil literature]], and deals with love, war, governance, trade and bereavement. Much of the Tamil literature belonging to the Sangam period has been lost. The literature currently available from this period is perhaps just a fraction of the material produced during this period.   
   
In the Sangam literature, the Tamil language had reached a level of maturity and began to serve as a powerful and elegant medium of literary expression. It had already developed an elaborate code of conventions governing the portrayal of social life in literature. This must clearly have been the result of evolution and development spread over some generations.   
   
Recent researches examining [[Chera dynasty|Chera]] inscriptions found in southwestern [[Tamil Nadu]] have revealed names of three generations of rulers from the Chera clan. These names are also found in some of the Sangam anthology ''[[Pathirruppaththu]]''. Palaeographic analysis of the inscriptions has revealed its age to be within the first two centuries of the Common Era.   
   
Evidence from ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Alexandria]]n travellers such as [[Strabo]], [[Ptolemy]] and [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]] give details of the trade and other relations between the Tamil states and the ancient Greece and Rome. Archaeology has given proof supporting these accounts. Numerous Roman gold and silver coins and pottery have been found from all over Tamil Nadu.

== Sangam as a historical source ==

It is difficult to estimate the exact date of these Sangam works. The period covered by the extant literature of the Sangam is unfortunately not easy to determine with any measure of certainty. Except the longer epics ''[[Cilappatikaram]]'' and ''[[Manimekalai]]'', which by common consent belong to the age later than the Sangam age, the poems have reached us in the forms of systematic anthologies. Each individual poem has generally attached to it a colophon on the authorship and subject matter of the poem, the name of the king or chieftain to whom the poem relates and the occasion which called forth the eulogy are also found.   
   
It is from these colophons and rarely from the texts of the poems themselves, that we gather the names of many kings and chieftains and the poets and poetesses patronised by them. The task of reducing these names to an ordered scheme in which the different generations of contemporaries can be marked off one another has not been easy. To add to the confusions, some historians have even denounced these colophons as later additions and untrustworthy as historical documents.   
   
A careful study of the synchronisation between the kings, chieftains and the poets suggested by these colophons indicates that this body of literature reflect occurrences within a period of four or five continuous generations at the most, a period of 120 or 150 years.   
   
Any attempt at extracting a systematic chronology and data from these poems should be aware of the casual nature of these poems and the wide difference between the purposes of the anthologist who collected these poems and the historian’s attempts are arriving at a continuous history.   
   
The Sangam age ended around the 3rd century CE with the invasion of [[Kalabhras]] from the north.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3462">'''The Red Ettin''' or '''The Red Etin''' is a [[fairy tale]] collected by [[Joseph Jacobs]].  It was included by [[Andrew Lang]] in ''[[The Blue Fairy Book]]''.

==Synopsis==
Two widows lived in a hut, and one had two sons and the other had one—or a single widow had three sons. One day the eldest son was told by his mother to fetch water for a cake, because it was time for him to seek his fortune, and the cake was all she could give him. The can was broken, the water he brought back little, and so the cake was small. The mother offered him all of it with her curse, or half with her blessing, and he took the whole. He left behind a knife, and said if the blade grew rusty, he was dead.

[[File:Page 138 illustration in English Fairy Tales.png|thumb|Illustration from Jacob's version by [[John D. Batten]]]]
He met a shepherd, a swineherd, and a goatherd; each of the [[Rule of three (writing)|three]] told him the Red Ettin of Ireland had kidnapped the king of Scotland's daughter, but that he was not the man to rescue her. The shepherd also told him to be wary of the beasts he would meet next. They each had two heads, with four horns on each head, and the man fled them and hid in a castle. An old woman told him that it was the castle of the Red Ettin, which had three heads, and he should leave, but he begged her to hide him as best she could, for fear of the beasts.

The Red Ettin returned, soon found him, and asked him three riddles; when he could answer none of them, the Ettin turned him to stone. At home, his knife grew rusty. In the variants with three sons, the younger brother went after the elder, and met the same fate. The youngest son, or the son of the other widow, set out after him, or them. First, a raven called over his head to look out as he brought the water, and so he patched up the holes and brought back enough water for a large cake. Then he left half with his mother for her blessing.

He met an old woman on the way who asked for a piece of his cake, and he gave it to her. She, being a [[fairy]], gave him a magical wand and a great deal of advice on what to do, and vanished. The shepherd, swineherd, and goatherd told him of the Red Ettin and the king of Scotland's daughter, and said that he was the man to defeat him. He walked boldly through the beasts to the castle, striking one dead with the wand, and stayed at the castle.

The Red Ettin asked him his riddle, but the man answered and cut off the Ettin's three heads. He restored the stone and freed the women the Red Ettin held prisoner, and the king married him to his daughter.

==Commentary==
Joseph Jacobs collected a version with the three men, but suppressed one because it was repetitious.  Andrew Lang included all three young men.

Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; Translanguaging involves issues of language production, effective communication, the function of language, and the thought processes behind language use.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is believed that the term was first coined in Welsh by Cen Williams as ''trawsieithu'' in his 1994 unpublished thesis titled, "An evaluation of teaching and learning methods in the context of bilingual secondary education".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Translanguaging  can be controlled by both the student and the teacher. It maximises the child's bilingual ability and is being used across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/translanguaging/ |title=Translanguaging - An approach to bilingualism where speakers switch from one language to another |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'trans' prefix emphasizes:
* the fluid practices that go beyond (transcend) socially constructed language systems and structures to engage diverse multiple [[meaning-making]] systems and subjectivities
* the transformative capacity of translanguaging practices not only for language systems, but also individuals' cognition and social structures
* the transdisciplinary consequences of re-conceptualizing language, language learning and language use for linguistics, psychology, sociology and education

When talking about bilingualism, some scholars consider translanguaging as opposed to a "double monolingualism".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ofeliagarciadotorg.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/education-multilingualism-translanguaging-21st-century.pdf |author=Ofelia Garcia |title=Education, Multilingualism and Translanguaging in the 21st Century |accessdate=15 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hult | first1 = F.M. | year = 2014 | title = Covert bilingualism and symbolic competence: Analytical reflections on negotiating insider/outsider positionality in Swedish speech situations | url = | journal = Applied Linguistics | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 63–81 | doi=10.1093/applin/amt003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some scholars have asserted that translanguaging is fundamentally different from [[Code-switching|codeswitching]], these claims have not been anchored to data or the theoretical literature on codeswitching. Like codeswitching, translanguaging is said to be characterized by the integration of multiple languages in the same speech event or linguistic context.&lt;ref name=":M"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacSwan|first=Jeff|date=2017|title=A multilingual perspective on translanguaging|url=|journal=American Educational Research Journa|volume=54 |issue=1|pages=167–201|doi=10.3102/0002831216683935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, translanguaging is dissimilar from [[diglossia]] because translanguaging practices do not mandate a language [[hierarchy]], nor do they mandate that different language systems are assigned to different domains or functions for the speaker; rather, translanguaging develops the adaptability and cooperation of language systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bilingual Education in the 21st Century: A Global Perspective|last=García|first=Ofelia|publisher=Blackwell|year=2009|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Bilingual education]] is thought to go back as far as 4000–5000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Dimensions of Bilingual Education|last=Mackey|first=William Francis|publisher=Georgetown University Press|year=1978|isbn=|location=Washington|pages=2–3|chapter=The Importation of Bilingual Education Models|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the bilingual tablets unearthed in [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]] in 1977, there were a number of pedagogical texts that were used to instruct young [[scribe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wellisch|first=Hans H.|year=1981|title=Ebla: The World's Oldest Library|url=|journal=The Journal of Library History|volume=16|issue=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ideology]] behind translanguaging emerged from the evolution of multilingual teaching practices, particularly the practices promoted by [[English as a second or foreign language|Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages]] (TESOL), an international association designed to advance the quality of English language instruction. The beginnings of bilingual education in the United States asserted the primacy of speech and fostered a stark neglect of written language learning.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raimes|first=Ann|date=1991|title=Out of the woods: Emerging traditions in the teaching of writing.|url=|journal=TESOL Quarterly|volume=25 |issue=3|pages=407–430|doi=10.2307/3586978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second language instruction of the 1960s and 70s heavily utilized oral-aural drills, and written portions of the courses were mimetic and repetition oriented, and structure, form, [[syntax]], and [[grammar]] were given priority status for learners.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raimes|first=Ann|date=1983|title=Tradition and teaching in ESL teaching|url=|journal=TESOL Quarterly|volume=17 |issue=4|pages=535–552|doi=10.2307/3586612}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In this system there was no focus on actual language use, which led to a lack of knowledge about how language and communication work in real practice.

In the late 1970s and 80s second language education shifted to focus on the importance of communication and language use for participation in particular [[Discourse community|discourse communities]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, emphasizing language-learning as a means to enter a discourse community was also problematic, as it pressured students to surrender their own language practices in order to become practicing members of the new discourse communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Second Language Writing: Research Insights for the Classroom|last=Johns|first=Ann|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990|isbn=|editor-last=Kroll|editor-first=B|location=Cambridge|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Translanguaging as a focus of study first emerged in [[Bangor, Wales]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Gwyn|last2=Jones|first2=Bryn|last3=Baker|first3=Colin|year=2012|title=Translanguaging: Origins and Development from School to Street and Beyond|url=|journal=Educational Research and Evaluation|volume=18|issue=7|pages=641–654|via=|doi=10.1080/13803611.2012.718488}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on [[François Grosjean]]'s idea that bilinguals are not two monolinguals in one.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/life-bilingual/201603/what-is-translanguaging|title=What is Translanguaging?|last=Grosjean|first=Francois|date=2016-03-02|website=Psychology Today|publisher=Sussex Publishers|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cen Williams and his colleagues were researching strategies of using both Welsh and English in a single lesson in a classroom setting. Cen Williams' [[Welsh language|Welsh]] term "''trawsieithu''" was translated into English as "translanguaging" by their colleague [[Colin Baker (bilingualism)|Colin Baker]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Scholars argue that translanguaging functions as an emancipation from the adverse [[Second-language acquisition|second language acquisition]] [[Pedagogy|pedagogies]] of the 20th century. They believe that translanguaging gives multilingual students an advantage within educational systems because it (1) promotes a more thorough understanding of content; (2) helps the development of the weaker language for bilingual or multilingual speakers; (3) fosters home-to-school links within language use; and (4) integrates fluent speakers with early learners, thus expediting the language learning process.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Major debates ==
A prominent argument against incorporating translanguaging into academic contexts is the notion that speakers of [[International English]]es would have difficulty communicating with one another because of the immense [[Variety (linguistics)|variety of Englishes]] spoken. However, advocates for translanguaging pedagogy maintain that misunderstandings between speakers of International Englishes who practice translanguaging are not common, and when misunderstandings do occur between speakers they are quickly resolved through other means of negotiation.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Advocates argue that speakers of International Englishes can communicate with relative ease because they have a variety of tools to utilize in order to make sense of the language varieties with which they engage.

Some academics call for the development of corpora of 'nonstandard' English varieties to aid with the study of translanguaging.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Barbara Seidlhofer argues that language acquisition programs should not be teaching language with the intention of achieving [[native-speaker]] competence, but that they should be "embracing the emergent realistic goal of [[Intercultural competence|intercultural]] competence achieved through a [[plurilingualism]] that integrates rather than ostracizes" [[Variety (linguistics)|International Englishes]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  This pedagogical strategy necessitates translanguaging as a means through which to accomplish such plurilingualism. For Seidlhofer, the incorporation of such International Englishes into educational systems would be more beneficial for second language learners than current dominant language acquisition pedagogies, which emphasize standard American and British varieties of English. Since achieving native-speaker status is nearly impossible without years of study, translanguaging presents students with opportunities to learn language in a more supportive space, fostering their language acquisition in all varieties rather than enforcing the participation in and acquisition of a single dominant variety.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cushman|first=Ellen|date=2016|title=Translingual and Decolonial Approaches to Meaning Making|url=|journal=College English|volume=78 |issue=3|pages=234–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Proponents of decolonizing the English language argue that holding on to particular varieties of English as the only legitimate varieties to use in language acquisition programs is a practice that perpetuates destructive colonial attitudes towards non-English languages and the English varieties of their speakers.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Incorporating translanguaging is one means through which such a decolonization of the English language could occur.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In this way, decentralizing those particular dominant varieties of English would work towards legitimizing the use of 'nonstandard' English varieties at the educational level.

== International translanguaging ==
Non-native speakers of English around the world outnumber native English speakers of English by a ratio of 3:1.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brumfit|first=Christopher|date=2004|title=Language and Higher Education: Two Current Challenges|url=|journal=Arts and Humanities in Higher Education|volume=3 |issue=2|pages=163–173|doi=10.1177/1474022204042685}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the current influx of technology and communication, English has become a heavily transnational language. As such, English varieties, and International Englishes are becoming standard usage in international economic exchanges, thereby increasing their legitimacy and decreasing the dominance of the standard American and British English varieties.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The peoples of anglophone, multi-ethnic societies, notably Malaysia and Singapore, speak, think, work, communicate and live their social lives primarily via translanguaging. In those societies, the creoles of Manglish and Singlish and their related dialects, are classic examples of translanguaging in a society. 

== Translanguaging pedagogy ==
The development of translanguaging as a part of [[Second-language acquisition|second language acquisition]] pedagogy signifies an ideological shift in [[Bilingual education|bilingual]] and [[Multilingual Education|multilingual education]] systems, wherein bilingualism and multilingualism are no longer viewed as a disadvantage to learning a second language, such as English, but rather as an asset.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=canagarajah|first=Suresh|date=2006|title=The place of world englishes in composition: Pluralization continued|url=|journal=College Composition and Communication|volume=57|pages=586–619}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M.  (2012). Ecology and multilingual education. In C. Chapelle (Gen. Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of applied linguistics'' (Vol. 3, pp. 1835-1840).  Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; The incorporation of translanguaging into educational settings signifies the movement of the English language towards a more [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] system encompassed of several equally valued English varieties, rather than a system of two enforced varieties ([[Standard American dialect|Standard American]] and [[British English]]es) contesting with several other depreciated minority [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individual Freedom in Language Teaching: Helping Learners to Develop a Dialect of their Own|last=Brumfit|first=Christopher|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seidlhofer|first=Barbara|date=2003|title=A concept of international English and related issues: From 'real English' to 'realistic English'|url=|journal=Language Council of Europe Language Policy Division GD IV|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, translanguaging pedagogy demands that multilingual speakers engaging in translanguaging do not vacillate between [[Variety (linguistics)|language systems]] arbitrarily, but rather, that they do it with intention and a [[Metacognition|metacognitive]] understanding of the way their language practices work.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Translanguaging promotes a deeper understanding of subject matter, by discussing in one language and writing in another.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/wales-plays-international-role-language-1888146#ixzz16OdwRkLN|title=Wales 'plays international role in language education'|last=Evans|first=Gareth|date=2010-11-26|newspaper=walesonline|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students will always reference what they already know from their first language when working with a second language.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Citation|last=CUNY NYSIEB|title=Session 2: What is translanguaging?|date=2015-11-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_AnGU8jy4o|accessdate=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helps students process the information and improve communication in their second language.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When introduced in a Welsh bilingual classroom, translanguaging meant that the input and output languages were often switched.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Cen|year=2002|title=Extending Bilingualism in the Education System|url=http://www.assembly.wales/Committee%20Documents/ELL%2006-02(p.4)%20Dr%20Cen%20Williams%20paper-20032002-28970/3c91c7af00023d820000595000000000-English.pdf|journal=Education and Lifelong Learning Committee|volume=6|issue=2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this type of setting, students are typically asked to read a text one language and discuss it either orally or in written form in their second language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the case of the Welsh classroom, the languages used were Welsh and English. This led to an increase of Welsh speakers in [[primary school]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in 2007, with 36.5% of the students being able to speak Welsh, compared to 1987 when only 24.6% of students spoke Welsh.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The goal of including translanguaging as an aspect of [[second-language acquisition]] pedagogy is to move beyond [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence-level]] and [[Grammar|grammatical]] concerns in second-language teaching strategies, and to focus more heavily on [[discourse]] issues and on the [[rhetoric]] of [[communication]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Students should be focused on the real applications of language that suit their purposes of communication based on the context in which they are communicating, rather than a one-variety-fits-all mode of learning language.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Some scholars writing within translanguaging pedagogy argue for a diversified conception of the English language, wherein the multiple varieties of English exist with their own norms and systems, but all have equal status. Such a system will enable a variety of communities to communicate effectively in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/asc16/aboutme.htm|title=Suresh Canagarajah About Me|last=Canagarajah|first=Suresh|date=2007|website=Pennsylvania State University Faculty|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canagarajah|first=Suresh|date=2007|title=Lingua Franca English, Multilingual Communities, and Language Acquisition|url=|journal=The Modern Language Journal|volume=91|pages=923–939|doi=10.1111/j.0026-7902.2007.00678.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In this conception of English language, it should be treated as a [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] [[World language|Global language]] wherein standard [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of English such as [[Indian English]], [[Nigerian English]], [[Trinidadian English]], would still have the same status as the orthodox varieties of [[British English|British]] and [[American English]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Reinforcing only one variety of English in academic situations is disadvantageous for students, since students will ultimately encounter many varied communicative contexts, and as society becomes more digitally advanced, many of those communicative contexts will be transnational.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://theotherjournal.com/2008/09/08/working-for-transformation-an-interview-with-suresh-canagarajah/|title=Working for Transformation: An Interview with Suresh Canagarajah|last=Hartse|first=Joel|date=2008|website=The Other Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Since translanguaging is not yet a widely sanctioned language practice in educational systems, it is often practiced by students in secret and kept hidden from instructors.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The practice of natural translanguaging without the presence of direct pedagogical effort can lead to issues of competence and transfer in academic contexts for students.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This issue is why academics call for the inclusion of translanguaging in [[Language acquisition|language acquisition programs]], since students need to practice their translanguaging in a semi-structured environment in order to acquire [[Linguistic competence|competence]] and [[Language proficiency|proficiency]] in communicating across academic contexts.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; If they are given the appropriate context in which to practice, students can integrate dominant writing conventions into their language practices and negotiate critically between language systems as they engage in translanguaging.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For students to be successful at translanguaging in academic and other varied contexts, they must exercise critical [[Metacognition|metacognitive awareness]] about their language practices.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Teachers ===
Making use of translanguaging in the classroom does not require the teacher to be bilingual; however, it does require the teacher to be a co-learner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Monolingual teachers working with bilingual or multilingual students can successfully utilize this teaching practice; however, they must rely on the students, their parents, the community, texts, and technology more than the bilingual teacher, in order to support the learning, and leverage the students' existing resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As translanguaging allows the legitimization of all varieties, teachers can participate by being open to learning the varieties of their students, and by incorporating words from unfamiliar languages into their own use, serving as a model for their students to begin working with their non-native languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lagabaster|first=David|last2=García|first2=Ofelia|date=2014|title=Translanguaging: Towards a dynamic model of bilingualism at school|url=|journal=Cultura y Educación|volume=26 |issue=3|pages=557–572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditionally censored nature of translanguaging in high-stakes writing assignments can prevent multilingual students from practicing their translanguaging abilities, and so it is the responsibility of the instructor to provide safe spaces for students to practice and develop their translanguaging skills.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Teachers must plan out the translanguaging practices to be used with their students just as each lesson must be planned out, as translanguaging is not random. By reading bilingual authors and texts, teachers give the students the chance to experience two or more languages together and help compare and contrast the languages for the children.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Importantly, the use of translanguaging in the classroom enables language acquisition for the students without the direct insertion or influence of the teacher.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While teachers do not need to become a compendium of the languages or language varieties practiced in their classrooms, they do need to be open to working with these new languages and language varieties to encourage student participation in translanguaging.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

'''''Truly Tasteless Jokes''''' is a book of [[off-color humor]] by [[Ashton Applewhite]], first published in 1982 under the pen name "Blanche Knott." The book was a cultural phenomenon and spawned dozens of sequels, including best-sellers '''''Truly Tasteless Jokes Two''''' (1983) and '''''Truly Tasteless Jokes Three''''' (1984), and a stand-up comedy special.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Background== 

Applewhite moved to New York City in 1977 to work for [[St. Martin's Press]], where she learned numerous offensive jokes, which her boss encouraged her to write down. In a 2011 article in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', Applewhite wrote that her collection of jokes quickly grew, and she would ask her coworkers and friends if they knew any others. Frustrated over her $8,500 annual salary as a lowly assistant, she decided to compile a book of the jokes to publish.&lt;ref name="harpers"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Applewhite|first1=Ashton|title=Being Blanche|journal=[[Harper's Magazine]]|date=June 2011|url=http://longform.org/stories/being-blanche|accessdate=August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applewhite asked a colleague to be her book agent, but their attempts to have the book published resulted in strong rejections; Applewhite recalled that her agent was told by [[Dell Publishing]]'s paperback imprint that "We can't publish this here. I'm not even sure we can ''Xerox'' it."&lt;ref name="harpers"/&gt;

Marilyn Abraham, an editor at [[Random House]] imprint [[Ballantine Books]], decided to publish it. The original title was one of Applewhite's favorite jokes, ''What’s the Difference Between Garbage and a Girl from New Jersey?'' (punchline: garbage gets picked up); however, the marketing director responded that she did not get it and wanted to know what the book was about. Applewhite responded, "It’s a book of tasteless jokes," which the marketing director liked.&lt;ref name="harpers"/&gt;

== Summary ==

Applewhite organized her joke collection into "timeless categories" including [[Helen Keller]] ("How did Helen Keller burn her fingers? Reading the waffle iron"), [[dead baby jokes|dead baby]], Jewish, [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]], black, [[Polish jokes|Polish]], homosexual, and handicapped.&lt;ref name="harpers" /&gt; The book's jokes were typically a few lines or paragraphs in length.&lt;ref name="nyt7301983"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDowell|first1=Edwin|title=Ethnic Jokebooks Flourish Despite Criticism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/30/books/ethnic-jokebooks-flourish-despite-criticism.html|accessdate=August 20, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 30, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Truly Tasteless Jokes'' became a runaway bestseller, appearing on the bestseller lists of ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.&lt;ref name="nyt7301983"/&gt; The original book was the best-selling mass-market paperback of 1983; ''Truly Tasteless Jokes Two'' was No. 10 on the same list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDowell|first1=Edwin|title=Publishing: 'search' Heads 1983 Hard-cover List|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/03/books/publishing-search-heads-1983-hard-cover-list.html|accessdate=August 20, 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 3, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's uncensored jokes received significant criticism. Historian [[Barbara Tuchman]] spoke of the "breakdown of decency and of standards of taste" in these "terribly tasteless, disgusting books," while professor [[John Hope Franklin]] said the books' success was "a sad testament to the taste of this country." In a satirical vein, an installment of the comic strip Bloom County featured a book with a title similar to Truly Tasteless Jokes, portrayed as an inspirational text read by members of a counterculture resembling the hippies of the 1960s, but espousing conservative views considered typical of the Reagan era in American politics. The condemnation and criticism, however, did little to stop the book's success.&lt;ref name="nyt8231983"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rothstein|first1=Edward|title=Reading and Writing: Freud on Tastelessness|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/28/books/reading-and-writing-freud-on-tastelessness.html|accessdate=September 4, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 28, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Edward Rothstein]], analyzing the books' success for ''The New York Times'', wrote, "... the telling of a joke brings into the light of society that which is hidden; it creates a marriage between the respectable and the unacceptable. ''Tasteless'' jokes, though, would seem to have gone far beyond the bounds. These are not subtle expressions, their critics charge, but slurs and violations. They result not in marriage, nor even in an affair, but in a reconnoiter somewhere in the shadows. Actually, however, the rendezvous takes place in full daylight, with prejudices and fears displayed for the pleasure of thousands, and the point being made may not be as obvious as it at first appears. ... The ''tastelessness'' of these jokes—many of which have been told for generations—is their main point: Prejudice is mocked, distended to a ludicrous degree. The target of these ''outrageous'' and ''gross'' quips is the very pieties of society that apply such labels. They make us laugh at the pretense that such prejudices do not exist and at the respectable assertion that we are really all the same."&lt;ref name="nyt8231983"/&gt;

[[File:Krabbeplas (jan 2010).jpg|{{largethumb}}|The Krabbeplas near Vlaardingen, one of the places where [[Artifact_(archaeology)|archeological artifacts]] of the Vlaardingen culture have been found]]

'''Vlaardingen Culture''' was an [[archaeological culture]] on the border of the middle and late [[Neolithic]] era in what is now the coastal region in the west of the [[Netherlands]]. Archeologists found in 1958 in [[Vlaardingen]], a city near [[Rotterdam]], objects from the period between 3500&amp;nbsp;BC and 2500&amp;nbsp;BC which justify the designation as a separate culture. Utensils were made of wood and bone, and polished small stone axes were found, which appear to originate from Belgium. Also needles and the remains of a primitive canoe were found.

This hunting and fishing culture was [[sedentary]] and [[semi-nomadic]]. In the old dunes at the then much further east lying coastline the remains of some [[peasant]] settlements were found. From these findings it can be deduced that [[animal husbandry]] (sheep and goats) and agriculture (wheat and [[barley]]) had been practised on a small scale. Vlaardingen culture had also traits of a [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherer]] society because agriculture in much of the [[Wadden Sea]] area and the [[Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta]] was difficult. Hunting and fishing were important means of livelihood. Bones found near the settlements of deer, bears, otters and sturgeon support that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.amsterdam.nl/flevopark/Geschiedenis/boeren/eeuw30/vlaardingencultuur.html |title=Vlaardingencultuur (3000 - 2800 v.

Vlaardingen culture co-existed with the more land inward [[Funnel beaker culture]] to which it shows similarities and differences. Based on the pottery and the occupied environment, the Vlaardingen culture and the Funnel beaker culture seem clearly distinguishable from one another. When the Funnel beaker culture ceases to exist, the [[Corded Ware culture]] succeeds it. The Vlaardingen culture however, endures in the west (3400–2500&amp;nbsp;BC), until it is finally succeeded by the Corded Ware culture as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/18907 |title=Relations, relations..? on Dutch cultures of the middle and late Neolithic and their possible relations |publisher=Openaccess.leidenuniv.nl |date=2011-08-03 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Whistling Shade''' is a [[literary journal]] based in [[St. Paul]], [[Minnesota]]. Founded in 2001, the journal features [[fiction]], [[poetry]], [[memoir]] and [[essays]] on literary topics. Whistling Shade is semi-annual, and the print issue is distributed freely in cafes, book stores, and libraries in the Twin Cities area. Issues often have themes such as ghosts, mystery, song lyrics and bar stories.

According to the journal website, Whistling Shade takes “a populist approach to literature and our audience is the general reading public.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whistlingshade.com|title=Whistling Shade|website=www.whistlingshade.com|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is run by volunteers, has no academic backing and chooses not to apply for grants. Whistling Shade also publishes [[novels]], short story and poetry collections by authors such as Jarda Cervenka, Sharon Chmielarz, Norita Dittberner-Jax and Jeff Vande Zande. It is financed by book sales, subscriptions and advertising. Poet Alan Morrison wrote of Whistling Shade: "it’s the sheer uncynical, approachable and didactic style of the articles which struck me, making for genuinely informative reading, on a variety of literary-related subjects, blissfully free of that consciously ‘ironic’ style of commentary that sadly informs much of UK journals."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.therecusant.org.uk/#/whistling-shade/4530998451&lt;/ref&gt;
