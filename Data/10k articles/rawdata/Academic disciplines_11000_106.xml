'''''Adam’s Task: Calling Animals by Name''''' by philosopher, poet, and animal trainer [[Vicki Hearne]] describes an innovative and metaphysical approach to training animals. Based on studies of literary criticism, philosophy, and extensive hands-on experience in training, Hearne asserts that animals (specifically those that commonly cohabit or interact with humans) are far more intelligent than most people assume. In fact, they are capable of developing an understanding of “the good,” a moral code that influences their motives and actions. In response to her studies and experiments, Hearne developed an entirely new system of animal training that contradicts modern animal behavioral research and yet, she insists through many examples, is astonishingly effective.

''Adam's Task'' was Hearne's first—and probably best-known—book, though she authored several other successful titles, including ''Animal Happiness'' and ''Bandit''. The focus of ''Adam's Task'' is on the complexities of human-animal communication and the importance of seeing domestic animals as they truly are—not as anthropomorphized creatures whom we see however we wish to see them. Some of the training methods described in the book have drawn criticism from various factions of animal activists, but Hearne stresses that she is striving for intellectual and moral integrity in all of her studies, and many agree that her obvious love for animals speaks in her defense.

The ''Boston Globe'' calls ''Adam’s Task'' “A beautiful, wonderful book of the sort that permanently refreshes thought and feeling.” The ''New York Times'' says “When Ms. Hearne relates a dog or horse story, the animals become full-fledged characters, as brightly delineated as people created by Dickens or Twain.”

''Adam's Task'' was first published by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]] in 1986. It is now available from [[Skyhorse Publishing]] with a new introduction by [[Donald McCaig]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6539">'''Biomanipulation''' is the deliberate alteration of an [[ecosystem]] by adding or removing species, especially predators.

==Aquatic ecosystems==
Changing the fish population of bodies of water as a part of [[watershed management]] can facilitate desirable changes in [[aquatic ecosystems]] suffering from [[eutrophication]] characterized by domination by [[phytoplankton]] aiding [[ecosystem restoration]], an application of [[restoration ecology]]. In ponds or lakes alternative stable conditions, one with high algae populations, little other plant life, and turbid water, another with low algae populations, a diverse plant population, and clear water, may exist. In addition to prevention of excess nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrates, removal of certain fish species adapted to turbid water may facilitate change from one steady state to the other, an application of [[dynamical systems theory]].&lt;ref name=NYT72012&gt;{{cite news |last=Guterl |first=Fred |title=Searching for Clues to Calamity |date=2012-07-20 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/21/opinion/the-climate-change-tipping-point.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fish species may be removed by means of poison, harvesting, or introduction of predatory species. As a different fish community will result from the process it will affect recreational and commercial fishermen whose cooperation or opposition is important.&lt;ref name=FAO952&gt;{{cite journal|title=Consequences of biomanipulation for fish and fisheries.|journal=FAO Fisheries Circular|year=2001|issue=952|pages=23|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/007/y0814e/y0814e00.pdf|accessdate=July 21, 2011|author=Eddy H.R.R.

Lake Zwemlust, a hypertrophic pond used as a swimming pool in The Netherlands with an area of 1.5 hectares and an average depth of 1.5 meters, was treated in March 1987. The initial [[Secchi disk|Secchi disk transparency]] was only 0.3 meters, less than the 1 meter maximum permitted for swimming pools in The Netherlands. In the first summer Secchi disk transparency increased to at least 2.5 meters, the maximum depth of the lake.&lt;ref name="10.1007/BF02286424"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Donk|first=E. |author2=R. D.

The '''Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques (CIRM)''' is a mathematics research institute associated with the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS) and the [[Société Mathématique de France]] (SMF). It is located in Luminy, Marseille, France and is affiliated with [[Aix-Marseille University]]. CIRM hosts weekly workshops on diverse topics where mathematicians and scientists from all over the world come to do collaborative research. Modeled as a "[[Medici villas|villa Medici]] of mathematics", it receives around 3,500 visitors per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lis|first1=Louise|title=Dans la villa Médicis des maths|url=https://lejournal.cnrs.fr/articles/dans-la-villa-medicis-des-maths|website=Le journal|publisher=Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|accessdate=9 July 2017|language=fr|date=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1954, a report from the CNRS discussed potential sites for a meeting place to hold international seminars and workshops in mathematics similar to the [[Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach|Mathematisches Forschunginstitut Oberwolfach]]. The Luminy estate, formerly owned by the prominent [[Fabre Line|Fabre]] shipping family, was chosen in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Bit of History|url=http://www.cirm-math.com/a-bit-of-history.html|website=Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate was handed over to the SMF in 1979. The center opened in 1981 and the first workshop was held in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Contrucci|first1=Jean|title=Le Centre international de rencontres mathématiques a été inauguré à Marseille|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1981/06/24/le-centre-international-de-rencontres-mathematiques-a-ete-inaugure-a-marseille_2729406_1819218.html|accessdate=9 July 2017|work=Le Monde|date=24 June 1981|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific programs==
CIRM supports a variety of residential programs and workshops. Each year, CIRM runs around 35 week-long workshops with an average of 75 weekly participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Propose an event|url=http://www.cirm-math.com/propose-an-event.html|website=Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIRM also supports joint programs with [[Société de Mathématiques Appliquées et Industrielles]], [[Institut Henri Poincaré]], and [[Société Mathématique de France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Centre d’Eté Mathématique de Recherche Avancée en Calcul Scientifique|url=http://smai.emath.fr/spip.php?article51&amp;lang=fr|website=Societe de Mathematiques Appliquees et Industrielles|accessdate=9 July 2017|language=fr|date=24 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jean-Morlet Chair===
CIRM hosts the Jean-Morlet Chair, which is a six-month residential program for international researchers to collaborate with a local project leader from [[Aix-Marseille University]] to plan events and projects. The chair was named after [[Jean Morlet]], a French geophysicist who worked with Marseille-based researcher [[Alex Grossman]], among others, to develop the [[Wavelet transform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jean-Morlet Chair|url=http://www.chairejeanmorlet.com/|website=Chaire Jean-Morlet|publisher=Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past chairs have included Nicola Kistler, Boris Hasselblatt, Igor Shparlinski, [[Hans Georg Feichtinger]], Herwig Hauser, Francois Lalonde, [[Dipendra Prasad]], [[Mariusz Lemańczyk]], [[Konstantin Khanin]], Shigeki Akiyama, and Genevieve Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Semester Chairs|url=http://www.chairejeanmorlet.com/semesters.html|website=Chaire Jean-Morlet|publisher=Centre International de Recontres Mathematiques|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''clastogen''' is a [[mutagenic]] agent giving rise to or inducing disruption or breakages of [[chromosome]]s, leading to sections of the chromosome being deleted, added, or rearranged.&lt;ref&gt;Rosefort C., Fauth E., Zankl H.: Micronuclei induced by aneugens and clastogens in mononucleate and binucleate cells using cytokinesis block assay. Mutagenesis 19, pp. 277-284 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; This process is a form of [[mutagenesis]], and can lead to [[carcinogenesis]], as cells that are not killed by the clastogenic effect may become cancerous. Known clastogens include [[acridine yellow]], [[benzene]], [[ethylene oxide]], [[arsenic]], [[phosphine]] and [[mimosine]]. Exposure to clastogens increases frequency of abnormal germ cells in paternal males, contributing to developmental effects in the fetus upon fertilization.

: &lt;u&gt;Illustrative sentence&lt;/u&gt;: "This leads to the conclusion that a chemical that fails to induce a significant response in an ''in vitro'' clastogenicity assay is unlikely to be clastogenic ''in vivo,'' in bone marrow assays."&lt;ref&gt;Rose, John. (1988). [https://books.google.com/books?id=5lMP9ivOoxcC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=Clastogenic&amp;lr=  ''Environmental Toxicology: Current Developments,'' p. 64.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
The term "clastogenic" refers to volcanic eruptions which cause a particular type of [[ejecta]].
: &lt;u&gt;Illustrative sentence&lt;/u&gt;: "The complex features of this eruption can be explained by rapid deposition of coarse pyroclasts near the vent and the subsequent flowage of clastogenic lavas which were accompanied by a high eruption plume generating pumice falls and/or pyroclastic flows."&lt;ref&gt;Yasui, Maya and Takehiro Koyaguchi.

[[Image:201 Elements of the Human Body-01.jpg|thumb|right|500px|The main elements that compose the human body are shown from most abundant (by mass, not by fraction of atoms) to least abundant.]]

Body composition may be analyzed in terms of molecular type e.g., [[water]], [[protein]], [[connective tissue]], [[fat]]s (or [[lipid]]s), [[hydroxylapatite]] (in bones), [[carbohydrates]] (such as [[glycogen]] and [[glucose]]) and [[DNA]]. In terms of tissue type, the body may be analyzed into water, fat, muscle, bone, etc. In terms of cell type, the body contains hundreds of different types of cells, but notably, the largest ''number'' of cells contained in a human body (though not the largest mass of cells) are not human cells, but bacteria residing in the normal human gastrointestinal tract.

==Elements==
[[File:Two pie graphs about the composition of the human body.png|thumb|300px|Pie charts of typical human body composition by percent of mass, and by percent of atomic composition (atomic percent).]]
Almost 99% of the mass of the human body is made up of six elements: [[oxygen]], [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[calcium]], and [[phosphorus]]. Only about 0.85% is composed of another five elements: [[potassium]], [[sulfur]], [[sodium]], [[chlorine]], and [[magnesium]]. All 11 are necessary for life. The remaining elements are [[trace element]]s, of which more than a dozen are thought on the basis of good evidence to be necessary for life. All of the mass of the trace elements put together (less than 10 grams for a human body) do not add up to the body mass of magnesium, the least common of the 11 non-trace elements.

===Other elements===
Not all elements which are found in the human body in trace quantities play a role in life. Some of these elements are thought to be simple bystander contaminants without function (examples: caesium, titanium), while many others are thought to be active toxics, depending on amount (cadmium, mercury, radioactives). The possible utility and toxicity of a few elements at levels normally found in the body (aluminium) is debated. Functions have been proposed for trace amounts of cadmium and lead, although these are almost certainly toxic in amounts very much larger than normally found in the body. There is evidence that arsenic, an element normally considered a toxin in higher amounts, is essential in ultratrace quantities, in mammals such as rats, hamsters, and goats.&lt;ref name="Anke M. Arsenic 1986"&gt;Anke M. "Arsenic". In: Mertz W. ed., ''Trace elements in human and Animal Nutrition'', 5th ed. Orlando, FL: Academic Press, 1986, 347-372; Uthus E. O., "Evidency for arsenical essentiality", ''Environmental Geochemistry and Health'', 1992, 14:54-56; Uthus E.O., Arsenic essentiality and factors affecting its importance. In: Chappell W. R., Abernathy C. O., Cothern C. R. eds., ''Arsenic Exposure and Health''. Northwood, UK: Science and Technology Letters, 1994, 199-208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some elements  (silicon, boron, nickel, vanadium) are probably needed by mammals also, but in far smaller doses. Bromine is used abundantly by some (though not all) lower organisms, and opportunistically in [[eosinophil]]s in humans. One study has found bromine to be necessary to collagen IV synthesis in humans.&lt;ref name="pmid24906154"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=McCall AS, Cummings CF, Bhave G, Vanacore R, Page-McCaw A, Hudson BG |title = Bromine Is an Essential Trace Element for Assembly of Collagen IV Scaffolds in Tissue Development and Architecture|journal = Cell|volume = 157|issue = 6|pages = 1380–92|year = 2014|pmid = 24906154|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.05.009|pmc=4144415}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fluorine]] is used by a number of plants to manufacture toxins (see that element) but in humans only functions as a local (topical) hardening agent in tooth enamel, and not in an essential biological role.&lt;ref name="Lehninger"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nelson, Lehninger, Cox |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry |date=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elemental composition list===
{{main article|Dietary element}}
The average {{convert|70|kg|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Human body|adult human body]] contains approximately {{val|7|e=27}} [[atom]]s and contains at least detectable traces of 60 [[chemical element]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.jlab.org/qa/mathatom_04.html How many atoms are in the human body?]&lt;/ref&gt; About 29 of these elements are thought to play an active positive role in life and health in humans.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;"Ultratrace minerals". Authors: Nielsen, Forrest H. USDA, ARS Source: ''Modern nutrition in health and disease'' / editors, Maurice E. Shils ... et al.. Baltimore : Williams &amp; Wilkins, c. 1999, p. 283-303. Issue Date: 1999 URI: [http://hdl.handle.net/10113/46493]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative amounts of each element vary by individual, mainly due to differences in the proportion of fat, muscle and bone in their body. Persons with more fat will have a higher proportion of carbon and a lower proportion of most other elements (the proportion of hydrogen will be about the same).
The numbers in the table are averages of different numbers reported by different references.

The adult human body averages ~53% water.{{fv|date=July 2018|reason=Not in the source cited. And if this was obtained by averaging the male and female averages, then it's a terrible math and incorrect}} This varies substantially by age, sex, and adiposity. In a large sample of adults of all ages and both sexes, the figure for water fraction by weight was found to be 48 ±6% for females and 58 ±8% water for males.&lt;ref name="here"&gt;See table 1. [http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/33/1/27.full.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; Water is ~11% hydrogen by [[mass]] but ~67% hydrogen by [[atomic percent]], and these numbers along with the complementary % numbers for oxygen in water, are the largest contributors to overall mass and atomic composition figures. Because of water content, the human body contains more oxygen by mass than any other element, but more hydrogen by atom-fraction than any element.

The elements listed below as "Essential in humans" are those listed by the (US) [[Food and Drug Administration]] as essential nutrients,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm064928.htm "Guidance for Industry: A Food Labeling Guide 14. Appendix F"]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as six additional elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen (the fundamental building blocks of life on Earth), sulfur (essential to all cells) and cobalt (a necessary component of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;). Elements listed as "Possibly" or "Probably" essential are those cited by the [[National Research Council (United States)]] as beneficial to human health and possibly or probably essential.&lt;ref name="Medicine2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Institute of Medicine|title=Dietary Reference Intakes: The Essential Guide to Nutrient Requirements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYZZTgjDeccC&amp;pg=PA415|accessdate=21 June 2016|date=29 September 2006|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-15742-1|pages=313–19, 415–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6135">{{Expand German|Tanzverbot|date=November 2012}}
'''Dancing bans''' are legal or religious prohibitions against dancing, which have been applied at various times in various jurisdictions around the world. Even more controversial than recreational or artistic dancing have been sexually suggestive forms such as [[lap dancing]], [[topless dancing]], and [[rave]] dancing.

==Legal bans==
''Tanzverbot'' is the German term for "dancing ban". In Germany and Switzerland, dancing on some holidays is banned by most [[German states|state]] or [[Swiss cantons|canton]] governments. These occasions are certain [[Christianity|Christian]] and secular holidays aimed at mourning or contemplation, such as [[Good Friday]], [[All Saints' Day]] (from its association with [[All Souls' Day]] practices) or memorial days like [[Volkstrauertag]]. The German and Swiss dancing bans prohibit public parties, but not dancing in one's private residence.

Until 1999, an ordinance in [[Pound, Virginia]] required that dance hall permits not be granted "to anyone who is not a proper person, nor to a person who is not a person of good moral character". After community opposition to granting him a permit, a lawsuit by William Elam, owner of the Golden Pine restaurant, resulted in the ordinance being struck down as unconstitutionally vague and infringing on free expression protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. A replacement ordinance drafted more narrowly prompted a 2001 lawsuit from Elam, though the restaurant later went out of business after revocation of its alcohol license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/identity/dance_pound.htm|title=Pound, Virginia Bans Dancing?|accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sullivan-county.com/z/gpine.htm|title=Part 2: ABC revokes Golden Pine restaurant's license to sell alcohol|accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1926, the [[New York City Cabaret Law]] has prohibited dancing in all spaces open to the public that sell food and/or drink with the exception of those who obtain a cabaret license. This law was still enforced until it was repealed in 2017. 

Between 1985 and 2002, a [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]] law called the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]] enacted strict legal requirements for those wishing to have dancing by youth under the age of 21, effectively banning events that would feature young people dancing.

===Historic bans===
From the 1830s to 1950s, [[play party (U.S. traditional)|play parties]] became popular as a means to circumvent restrictions on dancing.

The events of the [[Footloose (1984 film)|1984 film ''Footloose'']] were inspired by a dancing ban in the heavily [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] town of [[Elmore City, Oklahoma]], which lasted until 1980.
==Religious bans==
===Christianity===
Various Christian groups believe that dancing is either inherently sinful or that certain forms of dancing could lead to sinful thoughts or activities, and thus proscribe it either in general or during religious services. These include some adherents of [[Mennonite]], [[Hutterite]], [[Baptist]], [[Seventh-day Adventist]], and [[Holiness movement]] sects. [[Jehovah's Witness]]es disfavor events where there might be sexually suggestive dancing or excessive drinking of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://defendingjehovahswitnesses.blogspot.com/2012/01/how-do-jehovahs-witnesses-view-dancing.html|title=How Do Jehovah's Witnesses View Dancing?|accessdate=2012-11-17|date=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[Church of the Nazarene]] recommends against "All forms of dancing that detract from spiritual growth and break down proper moral inhibitions and reserve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf|title=Manual|page=51|year=2005–2009|author=Church of the Nazarene|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302214359/http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf|archivedate=2013-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Christian churches determine doctrine locally and may be non-denominational, and these vary on their stances on social dancing.

In contrast, some strains of [[Charismatic Christianity]] practice rituals in which the [[Holy Spirit]] is believed to cause spontaneous dancing, among other behaviors. [[Mormonism]] has embraced social dancing to some degree since its founding.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/5654 |contribution= Dance |pages= 354-355 |last= Jacobson |first= Phyllis C. |editor-last= Ludlow |editor-first= Daniel H |editor-link= Daniel H.

===Islam===
In Islam, [[Salafists]] and [[Wahhabis]] consider dancing in general to be ''[[haram]]'' (forbidden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-08-31/news/33500441_1_music-and-dance-couples-dances-anti-dance|date=2012-08-31|title=Does Islam ban dancing and music?|agency=Slate|author=Brian Palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative Islamic and [[Orthodox Jewish]] traditions prohibit contact between men and women in public (especially those not married to each other), and thus in these societies men and women either dance separately or not at all.

In contrast, [[Sufism]] encourages dancing, for example [[Sufi whirling]] and dancing to celebrate [[Mela Chiraghan]]. This has resulted in conflict in areas influenced by the [[Taliban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/07/pakistani-festival-dancer_n_183960.html|accessdate=2012-11-17|date=2009-05-08|title=Pakistani Festival Dancers Banned By Religious Group|author=Stuart Whatley|work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''De re metallica''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''On the Nature of Metals'' [''Minerals'']) is a book cataloguing the state of the art of [[mining]], [[Refining (metallurgy)|refining]], and [[smelting]] [[metals]], published a year posthumously in 1556 due to a delay in preparing woodcuts for the text. The author was Georg Bauer, whose pen name was the Latinized [[Georgius Agricola]]. The book remained the authoritative text on mining for 180 years after its publication. It was also an important chemistry text for the period and is significant in the history of chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Mining was typically left to professionals, craftsmen and experts who were not eager to share their knowledge. Much experiential knowledge had been accumulated over the course of time. This knowledge was consecutively handed down orally within a small group of technicians and mining overseers. In the Middle Ages these people held the same leading role as the master builders of the great cathedrals, or perhaps also alchemists. It was a small, cosmopolitan elite within which existing knowledge was passed on and further developed but not shared with the outside world. Only a few writers from that time wrote anything about mining itself. Partly, that was because this knowledge was very difficult to access. Most writers also found it simply not worth the effort to write about it. Only in the Renaissance did this perception begin to change. With the improved transport and the [[movable type|invention of the printing press]] knowledge spread much more easily and faster than before. In 1500, the first printed book dedicated to mining engineering, called the ''Nutzlich Bergbuchleyn'' (The Useful Little Mining Book”) by Ulrich Rulein von Calw, was published. The most important works in this genre were, however, the twelve books of ''De Re Metallica'' by Georgius Agricola, published in 1556.

Agricola had spent nine years in the [[Bohemia]]n town of [[Joachimsthal]], now in the [[Czech Republic]]. ([[Joachimsthal]] is famous for its silver mines and the origin of the word "[[Thaler]]" and, ultimately, "[[dollar]].") After Joachimsthal, he spent the rest of his life in [[Chemnitz]], a prominent mining town in [[Saxony]]. Both Joachimsthal and Chemnitz are in the [[Erzgebirge]], or [[Ore Mountains (Germany)|Ore Mountains]].

The book was greatly influential, and for more than a century after it was published, ''De Re Metallica'' remained a standard treatise used throughout Europe.  The German mining technology it portrayed was acknowledged as the most advanced at the time, and the metallic wealth produced in German mining districts was the envy of many other European nations. The book was reprinted in a number of Latin editions, as well as in German and Italian translations. Publication in Latin meant that it could be read by any educated European of the time. The numerous woodcuts and detailed descriptions of machinery made it a practical reference for those wishing to replicate the latest in mining technology.&lt;ref&gt;Eric H. Ash, [https://books.google.com/books?id=IfyHKqKewugC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=%22de+re+metallica%22+bauer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PITBUq_aG8S8yAHFvoHICw&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22de%20re%20metallica%22%20bauer&amp;f=false Power, Knowledge, and Expertise in Elizabethan England] (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2004) 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, the first English [[translation]] of ''De Re Metallica'' was privately published in [[London]] by subscription. The translators were [[Herbert Hoover]], a mining engineer (and later [[President of the United States]]), and his wife, [[Lou Henry Hoover]], a geologist and Latinist. The translation is notable not only for its clarity of language, but for the extensive footnotes, which detail the classical references to mining and metals. Subsequent translations into other languages, including German, owe much to the Hoover translations, as their footnotes detail their difficulties with Agricola's invention of several hundred Latin expressions to cover Medieval German mining and milling terms that were unknown to classical Latin. The most important translation—outside English—was the one published by the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Agricola, Zwolf Bücher vom Berg- und Hüttenwesen, (Berlin 1928).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

[[File:Agricola1.jpg|thumb|right|A water-powered [[mine hoist]] used for raising ore]]
The book consists of a preface and twelve chapters, labelled books I to XII, without titles. It also has numerous woodcuts that provide annotated diagrams illustrating equipment and processes described in the text.

===Preface===

Agricola addresses the book to prominent German aristocrats, the most important of whom were [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony]] and his brother Augustus, who were his main patrons. He then describes the works of ancient and contemporary writers on mining and metallurgy, the chief ancient source being [[Pliny the Elder]]. Agricola describes several books contemporary to him, the chief being a booklet by Calbus of Freiberg in German. The works of alchemists are then described. Agricola does not reject the idea of alchemy, but notes that alchemical writings are obscure and that we do not read of any of the masters who became rich. He then describes fraudulent alchemists, who deserve the death penalty. Agricola completes his introduction by explaining that, since no other author has described the art of metals completely, he has written this work, setting forth his scheme for twelve books. Finally, he again directly addresses his audience of German princes, explaining the wealth that can be gained from this art.

===Book I: Arguments for and against this art===

This book consists of the arguments used against the art and Agricola's counter arguments. He explains that mining and prospecting are not just a matter of luck and hard work; there is specialized knowledge that must be learned. A miner should have knowledge of [[philosophy]], [[medicine]], [[astronomy]], [[surveying]], [[arithmetic]], [[architecture]], [[drawing]] and [[law]], though few are masters of the whole craft and most are specialists. This section is full of classical references and shows Agricola's classical education to its fullest. The arguments range from philosophical objections to gold and silver as being intrinsically worthless, to the danger of mining to its workers and its destruction of the areas in which it is carried out. He argues that without metals, no other activity such as architecture or agriculture are possible. The dangers to miners are dismissed, noting that most deaths and injuries are caused by carelessness, and other occupations are hazardous too. Clearing woods for fuel is advantageous as the land can be farmed. Mines tend to be in mountains and gloomy valleys with little economic value. The loss of food from the forests destroyed can be replaced by purchase from profits, and metals have been placed underground by God and man is right to extract and use them. Finally, Agricola argues that mining is an honorable and profitable occupation.

===Book II: The miner and a discourse on the finding of veins===

This book describes the miner and the finding of veins. Agricola assumes that his audience is the mine owner, or an investor in mines. He advises owners to live at the mine and to appoint good deputies. It is recommended to buy shares in mines that have not started to produce as well as existing mines to balance the risks. The next section of this book recommends areas where miners should search. These are generally mountains with wood available for fuel and a good supply of water. A navigable river can be used to bring fuel, but only gold or gemstones can be mined if no fuel is available. The roads must be good and the area healthy. Agricola describes searching streams for metals and gems that have been washed from the veins. He also suggests looking for exposed veins and also describes the effects of metals on the overlying vegetation. He recommends trenching to investigate veins beneath the surface. He then describes [[dowsing]] with a forked twig although he rejects the method himself. Finally he comments on the practice of naming veins or shafts.

===Book III: Veins and stringers and seams in the rocks===

This book is a description of the various types of veins that can be found. There are 30 illustrations of different forms of these veins, forming the majority of Book III.  Agricola also describes a compass to determine the direction of veins and mentions that some writers claim that veins lying in certain directions are richer, although he provides counter-examples. He also mentions the theory that the sun draws the metals in veins to the surface, although he himself doubts this. Finally he explains that gold is not generated in the beds of streams and rivers and east-west streams are not more productive than others inherently. Gold occurs in streams because it is torn from veins by the water.

===Book IV: Delimiting veins and the functions of mining officials===

This book describes how an official, the ''[[Bergmeister]]'', is in charge of mining. He marks out the land into areas called ''meers'' when a vein is discovered. The rest of the book covers the laws of mining. There is a section on how the mine can be divided into shares. The roles of various other officials in regulating mines and taxing the production are stated. The shifts of the miners are fixed. The chief trades in the mine are listed and are regulated by both the Bergmeister and their foremen.

===Book V: The digging of ore and the surveyor's art===

This book covers underground mining and surveying. When a vein below ground is to be exploited a shaft is begun and a wooden shed with a windlass is placed above it. The tunnel dug at the bottom follows the vein and is just big enough for a man. The entire vein should be removed. Sometimes the tunnel eventually connects with a tunnel mouth in a hill side. Stringers and cross veins should be explored with cross tunnels or shafts when they occur. Agricola next describes that gold, silver, copper and mercury can be found as native metals, the others very rarely. Gold and silver ores are described in detail. Agricola then states that it is rarely worthwhile digging for other metals unless the ores are rich. Gems are found in some mines, but rarely have their own veins, lodestone is found in iron mines and [[emery (mineral)|emery]] in silver mines. Various minerals and colours of earths can be used to give indications of the presence of metal ores. The actual mineworking varies with the hardness of the rock, the softest is worked with a pick and requires shoring with wood, the hardest is usually broken with fire. Iron wedges, hammers and crowbars are used to break other rocks. Noxious gases and the ingress of water are described. Methods for lining tunnels and shafts with timber are described. The book concludes with a long treatise on surveying, showing the instruments required and techniques for determining the course of veins and tunnels. Surveyors allow veins to be followed, but also prevent mines removing ore from other claims and stop mine workings from breaking into other workings.

===Book VI: The miners' tools and machines===
[[File:Leitnagel Hund (Mining cart).png|thumbnail|250px|right|[[Minecart]] shown in ''[[De Re Metallica]]'' (1556). The iron guide pin fits in a groove between two wooden planks.  Railroads descended from [[minecart]]s.]]
This book is extensively illustrated and describes the tools and machinery associated with mining. Handtools and different sorts of buckets, wheelbarrows and trucks on wooded plankways are described. Packs for horses and sledges are used to carry loads above ground. Agricola then provides details of various kinds of machines for lifting weights. Some of these are man-powered and some powered by up to four horses or by waterwheels. Horizontal drive shafts along tunnels allow lifting in shafts not directly connected to the surface. If this is not possible treadmills will be installed underground. Instead of lifting weights similar machines use chains of buckets to lift water. Agricola also describes several designs of piston force pumps which are either man or animal powered or powered by waterwheels. Because these pumps can only lift water about 24 feet, batteries of pumps are required for the deepest mines. Water pipe designs are also covered in this section. Designs of wind scoop for ventilating shafts or forced air using fans or bellows are also described. Finally ladders and lifts using wicker cages are used to get miners up and down shafts.

===Book VII: On the assaying of ore===

This book deals with assaying techniques. Various designs of furnaces are detailed. Then [[cupellation]], [[crucibles]], [[Cubicle#Post Medieval|scorifier]]s and [[muffle furnace]]s are described. The correct method of preparation of the cupels is covered in detail with beech ashes being preferred. Various other additives and formulae are described, but Agricola does not judge between them. Triangular crucibles and scorifiers are made of fatty clay with a temper of ground-up crucibles or bricks. Agricola then describes in detail which substances should be added as fluxes as well as lead for smelting or assaying. The choice is made by which colour the ore burns out which gives an indication of the metals present. The lead should be silver-free or be assayed separately. The prepared ore is wrapped in paper, placed on a scorifier and then placed under a muffle covered in burning charcoal in the furnace. The cupel should be heated at the same time. The scorifier is removed and the metal transferred to the cupel. Alternatively the ore can be smelted in a triangular crucible, and then have lead mixed with it when it is added to the cupel.  The cupel is placed in the furnace and copper is separated into the lead which forms lithage in the cupel leaving the noble metal. Gold and silver are parted using an aqua which is probably nitric acid. Agricola describes precautions for ensuring the amount of lead is correct and also describes the amalgamation of gold with mercury. Assay techniques for base metals such as tin are described as well as techniques for alloys such as silver tin. The use of a touchstone to assay gold and silver is discussed. Finally detailed arithmetical examples show the calculations needed to give the yield from the assay.

===Book VIII: Roasting, crushing and washing ore===

In this book Agricola provides a detailed account of beneficiation of different ores. He describes the processes involved in ore sorting, roasting and crushing. The use of water for washing ores is discussed in great detail, e.g. the use of launders and washing tables. Several different types of machinery for crushing ore and washing it are illustrated and different techniques for different metals and different regions are described. 
[[File:Agricola01.jpg|thumb|left|Smelting ore, a woodcut from the book]]

===Book IX: Methods of smelting ores===

This book describes smelting, which Agricola describes as perfecting the metal by fire. The design of furnaces is first explained.
These are very similar for smelting different metals, constructed of brick or soft stone with a brick front and mechanically driven bellows at the rear. At the front is a pit called the fore-hearth to receive the metal. The furnace is charged with beneficiated ore and crushed charcoal and lit. In some gold and silver smelting a lot of slag is produced because of the relative poverty of the ore and the tap hole has to be opened at various times to remove different slag materials. When the furnace is ready, the forehearth is filled with molten lead into which the furnace is tapped. In other furnaces the smelting can be continuous, and lead is placed into the furnace if there is none in the ore. The slag is skimmed off the top of the metal as it is tapped. The lead containing the gold is separated by cupellation, the metal rich slags are re-smelted. Other smelting processes are similar, but lead is not added. Agricola also describes making crucible steel and distilling mercury and bismuth in this book.

===Book X: Separating silver from gold and lead from gold or silver===

Agricola describes parting silver from gold in this book by using acids. He also describes heating with antimony sulphide (stibium), which would give silver sulphide and a mixture of gold and antimony. The gold and silver can then be recovered with cupellation. Gold can also be parted using salts or using mercury. Large scale cupellation using a cupellation hearth is also covered in this book

===Book XI: Separating silver from copper===

This book describes separating silver from copper or iron. This is achieved by adding large amounts of lead at a temperature just above the melting point of lead. The lead will liquate out with the silver. This process will need to be repeated several times. The lead and silver can be separated by cupellation.

===Book XII: Manufacturing salt, soda, alum, vitriol, sulphur, bitumen, and glass===

This describes the preparation of what Agricola calls "juices": [[salt]], [[Sodium carbonate|soda]], [[nitre]], [[alum]], [[vitriol]], [[saltpetre]], [[sulphur]] and [[bitumen]]. Finally glass making is covered. Agricola seems less secure about this process. He is not clear about making glass from the raw ingredients but clearer about remelting glass to make objects.

Prof. Philippus Bechius (1521–1560), a friend of Agricola, translated ''De re metallica libri XII'' into German. It was published with the German title ''Vom Bergkwerck XII Bücher'' in 1557.

==Publication history==

Although Agricola died in 1555, the publication was delayed until the completion of the extensive and detailed [[woodcut]]s.{{when|date=August 2017}}

In 1912, the first English [[translation]] of ''De Re Metallica'' was privately published in [[London]] by subscription. The translators were [[Herbert Hoover]], a mining engineer (and later [[President of the United States]]), and his wife, [[Lou Henry Hoover]], a geologist and Latinist. The translation is notable not only for its clarity of language, but for the extensive footnotes, which detail the classical references to mining and metals, such as the ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]], the history of [[mining law]] in England, France, and the German states; safety in mines, including historical safety; and known [[minerals]] at the time that Agricola wrote ''De Re Metallica.'' This translation has been reprinted by [[Dover Books]].

Subsequent translations into other languages, including German, owe much to the Hoover translations, as their footnotes detail their difficulties with Agricola's invention of several hundred Latin expressions to cover Medieval German mining and milling terms unknown to classical Latin.

The '''Dulong–Petit law''', a thermodynamic law proposed in 1819 by French physicists [[Pierre Louis Dulong]] and [[Alexis Thérèse Petit]], states the classical expression for the molar specific [heat capacity] of certain chemical elements.  Experimentally the two scientists had found that the heat capacity per weight (the mass-specific heat capacity) for a number of elements was close to a constant value, ''after'' it had been multiplied by a number representing the presumed relative atomic weight of the element. These [[atomic weight]]s had shortly before been suggested by [[John Dalton]] and modified by [[Jacob Berzelius]].

In modern terms, Dulong and Petit found that the heat capacity of a [[mole (unit)|mole]] of many solid elements is about 3''R'', where ''R'' is the modern constant called the universal [[gas constant]]. Dulong and Petit were unaware of the relationship with ''R'', since this constant had not yet been defined from the later [[Kinetic Molecular Theory|kinetic theory]] of gases. The value of 3''R'' is about 25 [[joule]]s per [[kelvin]], and Dulong and Petit essentially found that this was the heat capacity of certain solid elements per mole of atoms they contained.

The modern theory of the heat capacity of solids states that it is due to [[phonon|lattice vibration]]s in the solid and was first derived in crude form from this assumption by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1907. The [[Einstein solid]] model thus gave for the first time a reason why the Dulong–Petit law should be stated in terms of the classical heat capacities for gases.

==Equivalent forms of statement of the law==

An equivalent statement of the Dulong–Petit law in modern terms is that, regardless of the nature of the substance, the [[specific heat capacity]] '''c''' of a solid element (measured in joule per kelvin per kilogram) is equal to 3'''R'''/''M'', where ''R'' is the [[gas constant]] (measured in joule per kelvin per mole) and ''M'' is the [[molar mass]] (measured in kilogram per mole). Thus, the heat capacity per mole of many elements is 3''R''.

The initial form of the Dulong–Petit law was:

:&lt;math&gt;cM = K&lt;/math&gt;

where c is the specific heat, ''M'' the atomic weights accepted in that day, and '''K''' is a new constant which we know today is about '''3R'''.

In modern terms the mass '''m''' divided by atomic weight ''M'' gives the number of moles '''N'''.

:&lt;math&gt;m/M = N&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, using uppercase '''C''' for the ''total'' heat capacity, and lowercase '''c''' for the specific heat capacity '''c''' :

:&lt;math&gt;(C/m)M = K&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C(M/m) = C/N = K = 3R&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;C/N = 3R&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore, the heat capacity of most solid crystalline substances is '''3R''' per mole of substance.

Dulong and Petit did not state their law in terms of the [[gas constant]] ''R'' (which was not then known). Instead, they measured the values of heat capacities (per weight) of substances and found them smaller for substances of greater atomic weight as inferred by Dalton and other early atomists. Dulong and Petit then found that when multiplied by these atomic weights, the value for the heat capacity (which would now be the heat capacity ''per [[mole (unit)|mole]]'' in modern terms) was nearly constant, and equal to a value which was later recognized to be 3 ''R''.

In other modern terminology, the [[Heat capacity#Dimensionless heat capacity|dimensionless heat capacity]] is equal to 3.

For chemical applications the Dulong-Petit Law is approximately given by the relation:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{atomic\;weight} \;\cdot\; \mathrm{specific\; heat\; capacity} = 6.4 &lt;/math&gt;

==Application limits==
[[File:GraphHeatCapacityOfTheElementsI2s.png|thumb|upright=2.2|The molar heat capacity plotted of most elements at 25°C plotted as a function of atomic number. The value of bromine is for the gaseous state. For iodine, a value for the gas and one for the solid is shown.]]

Despite its simplicity, Dulong–Petit law offers fairly good prediction for the specific heat capacity of many elementary solids with relatively simple crystal structure at high [[temperature]]s. This is because in the classical theory of [[heat capacity]], the heat capacity of solids approaches a maximum of 3''R'' per [[mole (unit)|mole]] of atoms because full vibrational-mode degrees of freedom amount to 3 degrees of freedom per atom, each corresponding to a quadratic kinetic energy term and a quadratic potential energy term. By the [[equipartition theorem]], the average of each quadratic term is {{frac|1|2}}''kT'', or {{frac|1|2}}''RT'' per mole (see derivation below). Multiplied by 3 degrees of freedom and the two terms per degree of freedom, this amounts to 3''R'' per mole heat capacity.

The Dulong&amp;ndash;Petit law fails at room temperatures for light atoms bonded strongly to each other, such as in metallic beryllium and in carbon as diamond. Here, it predicts higher heat capacities than are actually found, with the difference due to higher-energy vibrational modes not being populated at room temperatures in these substances.

In the very low (cryogenic) temperature region, where the quantum mechanical nature of energy storage in all solids manifests itself with larger and larger effect, the law fails for all substances. For crystals under such conditions, the [[Debye model]], an extension of the Einstein theory that accounts for statistical distributions in atomic vibration when there are lower amounts of energy to distribute, works well.

==Derivation==

A system of vibrations in a crystalline solid lattice can be modelled by considering harmonic oscillator potentials along each degree of freedom. Then, the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of the system can be written as&lt;ref name="landau"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Landau |first1=L. D. |last2=Lifshitz |first2=E. M.|title=Statistical Physics Pt. 1|edition= 3rd|series= Course in Theoretical Physics|volume= 5|year=1980|publisher=Pergamon Press|location= Oxford|isbn=978-0-7506-3372-7|page= 193,196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;F=N\varepsilon_0+k_BT\sum_\alpha \log\left(1-e^{-\hbar\omega_{\alpha}/k_BT}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the index ''&amp;alpha;'' sums over all the degrees of freedom.  In the 1907 [[Einstein solid|Einstein model]] (as opposed to the later [[Debye model]]) we consider only the high-energy limit:

: &lt;math&gt;k_BT\gg\hbar\omega_\alpha. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Then

: &lt;math&gt;1-e^{-\hbar\omega_\alpha/k_BT} \approx \hbar\omega_\alpha/k_BT \, &lt;/math&gt;

and we have

: &lt;math&gt;F=N\varepsilon_0+k_BT\sum_{\alpha}\log\left(\frac{\hbar\omega_{\alpha}}{k_BT}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Define ''geometric mean frequency'' by

: &lt;math&gt;\log\bar{\omega}=\frac{1}{M}\sum_\alpha \log\omega_\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' measures the total number of degrees of freedom of the system.

Thus we have

: &lt;math&gt;F=N\varepsilon_0-Mk_BT\log k_BT+Mk_BT\log\hbar\bar{\omega}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Using energy

: &lt;math&gt;E=F-T\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial T}\right)_V,&lt;/math&gt;

we have

: &lt;math&gt;E=N\varepsilon_0+Mk_BT. \, &lt;/math&gt;

This gives specific heat

: &lt;math&gt;C_V=\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial T}\right)_V=Mk_B,&lt;/math&gt;

which is independent of the temperature.

The bibliographical definition of an '''edition''' includes all copies of a [[book]] printed “from substantially the same setting of [[typesetting|type]],” including all minor [[typography|typographical]] variants.

The numbering of book editions is a special case of the wider field of [[revision control]]. The traditional conventions for numbering book editions evolved spontaneously for several centuries before any greater [[applied science]] of revision control became important to humanity, which did not occur until the era of widespread [[computing]] had arrived (when [[software]] and [[electronic publishing]] came into existence). The old and new aspects of book edition numbering (from before and since the advent of computing) are discussed below.

According to the definition of ''edition'' above, a book printed today, by the same [[publisher]], and from the same type as when it was first published, is still the ''first edition'' of that book to a [[bibliographer]]. However, [[book collector]]s generally use the term ''first edition'' to mean specifically the first [[#Print run|print run]] of the first edition (aka "first edition, first impression"). Since World War II, books often include a number line ([[printer's key]]) that indicates the print run.

A "first edition" per se is not a valuable collectible book. A popular work may be published and reprinted over time by many publishers, and in a variety of formats. There will be a first edition of each, which the publisher may cite on the copyright page, such as: "First mass market paperback edition". The first edition of a facsimile reprint is the reprint publisher's first edition, but not the first edition of the work itself.

The Independent Online Booksellers Association has a [http://www.ioba.org/pages/resources/first-edition-primer/ A First Edition Primer ] which discusses several aspects of identifying first editions including publishing and specific publishers way of designating first editions.

===Bibliographical definition===
The classic explanation of edition was given by [[Fredson Bowers]] in ''Principles of Bibliographical Description'' (1949). Bowers wrote that an edition is “the whole number of copies printed at any time or times from substantially the same setting of type-pages,” including “all issues and variant states existing within its basic type-setting, as well as all impressions.”

Publishers often use the same typesetting for the [[hardcover]] and [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] versions of a book. These books have different covers, the [[title page]] and copyright page may differ, and the page margin sizes may differ (same ''type area'', smaller ''trim''), but to a bibliographer they are the same edition.

From time to time, readers may observe an error in the text (or, in the days of metal type, a piece of broken type), and report these to the publisher. The publisher typically keeps these "reprint corrections" in a file pending demand for a new print run of the edition, and before the new run is printed, they will be entered.

The method of entry, obviously, depends on the method of typesetting. For [[Letterpress printing|letterpress metal]], it typically meant resetting a few characters or a line or two. For [[Linotype machine|linotype]], it meant casting a new line for any line with a change in it. With film, it involved cutting out a bit of the film and inserting a new bit. In an electronic file, it means entering the changes digitally.

Such minor changes do not constitute a new edition, but introduce typographical variations within an edition, which are of interest to collectors.

===Collectors' definition===
[[File:Tristram Shandy First edition spines.jpg|thumb|First editions of [[Laurence Sterne]]'s [[The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman|Tristram Shandy]] ]]
A common complaint of book collectors is that the bibliographer's definition is used in a book-collecting context. For example, [[J. D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' {{asof|2016|lc=y}} remains in print in hardcover. The type is the same as the 1951 first printing, therefore all hardcover copies are, for the bibliographer, the first edition. Collectors would use the term for the first printing only.

First edition most often refers to the first commercial publication of a work between its own covers, even if it was first printed in a periodical: the complete text of [[Ernest Hemingway]]’s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' appeared in the September 1, 1952 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', yet the generally accepted “first” edition is the hardcover book [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner]]’s published on September 8, 1952.

The term "first trade edition," refers to the earliest edition of a book offered for sale to the general public in book stores. For example, [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1906 novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' was published in two variant forms. A "Sustainers' Edition", published by the Jungle Publishing Company, was sent to subscribers who had advanced funds to Sinclair. The first trade edition was published by [[Doubleday, Page]] to be sold in bookstores.

Many book collectors place maximum value on the earliest bound copies of a book—promotional [[advance copy|advance copies]], bound galleys, uncorrected proofs, and advance reading copies sent by publishers to book reviewers and [[bookstore|booksellers]]. It is true that these are rarer than the production copies; but given that these were not printed from a different setting of type (just the opposite; the main purpose of galleys and proofs is to double-check the typeset matter that will be used for production), they are not different editions.

===Publishers' definitions===
Publishers use "first edition" according to their own purposes, and consequently among them the designation is used very inconsistently. The "first edition" of a trade book may be the first iteration of the work printed by the publisher in question or the first iteration of the work that includes a specific set of illustrations or editorial commentary.

Publishers of non-fiction, academic works, and [[textbook]]s generally distinguish between revisions of the text of the work, by typically citing the dates of the first and latest editions of the work in the copyright page. Exceptions to this [[rule of thumb]] include denominating as a "second edition" a new textbook that has a different format, title, and/or author(s) because a previous textbook that shares only the same subject matter as the "second edition" is considered the first edition. The reason for this stretch of the definition is often for the short-term marketing advantage of the new textbook, because, although first editions are often considered more valuable than later editions to book collectors, being a subsequent edition of a previous textbook gives the impression that the textbook denominated as a subsequent edition is more authoritative.

==Other types of editions==

=== Revised edition ===
Publishers sometimes denominate a new iteration of a work a "revised edition" or the "(N)th edition, revised" when the previous iteration has been editorially revised or updated yet the author or publisher does not want to denominate it the "(N+1)th edition" ("N" being the number of the previous edition) for some subjective reason. Conversely, a new iteration of a work that is not substantially different may be denominated a "new edition" or the "(N+1)th edition".

The qualitative difference between a "revised edition" and a "new edition" is subjective. This is analogous to the way that software publishers may denominate an iteration "version 3.7" and the subsequent updated iteration "version 4" instead of "version 3.8". The subjective judgment of the ''degree'' of [[Software versioning#Change significance|the significance of the change]] made with the new iteration or the perceived marketing advantage of designating the new iteration as a specific number determines how the new iteration is numbered.

Therefore, the designation "revised edition" does not designate any quality or quantity of revision with certainty.

===Revised and updated edition===
When a non-fiction book is first published it sometimes instigates more research on its subject. The author may determine that new information justifies the revision of the book. A new iteration of the book would be published as a new edition, which may be denominated a "revised and updated edition". However, as with the denomination of "revised edition", the use of "revised and updated edition" manifests only the subjective choice of the publisher, which may be different from the publisher of a previous "revised edition" of the same work.

=== Co-edition &lt;!-- Section linked from Horus Heresy (novels) --&gt; ===
The basic definition of a ''co-edition'' is when two publishing houses publish the same edition of a book (or equivalent versions of an edition, for example, translated versions), simultaneously or near-simultaneously, usually in different countries. English and American editions may [[American and British English spelling differences|differ in spelling]], and they [[list of works with different titles in the United Kingdom and United States|sometimes have different titles]]. Some examples:
* An English-language edition, from the same plates, films, or files, may be published in different anglophone countries by different publishing companies. For example, Arms &amp; Armour Press in the UK and Stackpole Books in the U.S. published co-editions of various monographs on military matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leventhal|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* A French-language novel published in France this year by a French publisher could become an English-language translation published in the U.S. next year by a U.S. publisher.

The logic of co-editions has often been to use the existing distribution systems of the different publishers in each country rather than establishing new distribution systems.

Advancing [[Information technology|IT]] and the globalization of publishing have been blurring the lines of what ''co-edition'' means. For example, anything published online is effectively published worldwide. Also, large multinational publishers now have existing distribution systems for their hardcopy books in many countries, so they don't need to partner with other companies. They may issue a book under a different imprint for each country, but the imprints are parts of the same parent corporation. The actual manufacturing of the books may be done in China regardless of where the copies will be sold.

=== e-dition ===
The term ''e-dition'', a play on the [[Internet-related prefixes#"E-"|''e-''for-electronic prefix]], has been used by various publishers to refer to various ideas, which include:
* The hardcopy book's content posted online, fully searchable
* Supplemental online-only content for buyers of the hardcopy book
* Online-only publishing (no hardcopy distribution)
* Proprietary-format digital publication ([[e-book]]s) for use in specialized hardware for reading the book ([[e-book reader]]s)

===Library edition===
A library edition may appear to be the same as copies appearing in shops and almost certainly uses the same setting. However, the binding and hinges are made extra strong to allow for the greater wear and tear in library books. This is analogous to the "police and taxi" packages for automobiles, in which heavier brakes and other upgrades are made to withstand harsher-than-standard use and longer [[duty cycle]]s.

===Book club edition===
A popular book is sometimes re-issued under the imprint of a [[Book sales club|book club]]. Often it is a new setting and with cheaper paper and binding. Any photographic illustrations in the original are either absent or reduced in number. Book club editions are sold to members at a good discount compared with the original issue price.

===Cheap edition===
After a book has exhausted the market at the high original price a publisher may issue a cheap edition themselves or sell the rights on to another publisher who will produce the book. A cheap edition typically uses a low-cost paper and is a paperback but they can be hardback. Also typically the size of the font is reduced to fit more words on a page to reduce the overall cost of the book. Naturally, for a cheap edition the author will receive a lower royalty but that may be compensated for by a greater volume of sales.

===Colonial edition===

During the peak of the [[British Empire]], cheap editions of novels published in Britain would often be produced for sale in the colonies before other editions of the books were sold. The rationale was that books took a long time to export to the colonies, that readership in those settlements was avid, and that books were an effective means to disseminate British values. Australia was by far the largest consumer of colonial editions. [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] (London) published the largest number of colonial edition titles. They began in 1843 and persisted (in terms of pricing and trade) until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Johanson, ''A study of colonial editions in Australia, 1843-1972''. Elibank Press, Wellington, New Zealand. {{ISBN|0958349630}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cadet edition===
A cadet edition is a cut down version of a book which is more simply written. It is intended for young readers rather than adults.

===Large print edition===
These editions are typically library editions but the font size of the text is much larger than usual so that persons with poor eyesight (often older persons) can more easily read the book. The [[large print]] books tend to be of a uniform size.

===Critical edition===
A critical edition is a scholarly publication, containing commentary, critique, and sometimes a full developmental history of the work from all available sources.

== Printing, print run, impression, et cetera ==
&lt;!-- This heading is the target of multiple anchor-linked redirects: [[Print run]], [[Printing run]], [[Impression (book)]], [[Impression (books)]], [[Impression (publishing)]], and [[Press run]]. --&gt;
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Krishnamurti's Notebook#Publication history]] [[The First and Last Freedom#Publication history]] ([[MOS:HEAD]]).--&gt;
A batch of identical copies of an iteration/edition of a work that is printed in the same, single execution of the production set-up is denominated a "print run", "printing run", "printing", "impression", or "press run" according to the subjective choice of the publisher. All these denominations denote the action of applying pressure to paper in order to produce the book, and therefore are interchangeable. One edition of a work may have any number of printings, e. g. first edition, first impression; first edition, second impression; and second edition, first impression. Books that sell poorly may have only one. Very successful books may have 50 or more. If present, the [[printer's key]] in the copyright page of a book can be used to identify the number of the printing in which it was produced. In [[printmaking]], however, an "impression" only denotes an individual copy of a specific printing of the work.

A publisher hopes to recoup a large amount of the initial costs of publishing a book from the sale of the copies/impressions produced in the first printing of the book. A variety of commercial and logistic factors are thus considered in deciding the number of books to be produced in a specific printing and their individual price.

Demand for additional printings after the first is always hoped for, because they increase a book's profitability. Once the [[fixed costs]] of developing, editing, typesetting, etc. have been covered by the revenue of the first sales, any additional revenue tends to add to the profit margin, minus, of course, the costs of the additional materials, printing, binding, and distribution.

Sometimes a printing will be unsatisfactory for various reasons, especially printings of artistic and photography books in which the quality of reproduction is paramount. A defective printing is usually destroyed by being [[Pulping|pulped]], yet occasionally a defective printing is shipped to a distant overseas market and there sold cheaply, contingent on the costs of shipping.

If sales of a book do not meet expectations, the remaining stock of a printing will be [[Remaindered book|remaindered]]. When all copies/impressions of a printing are sold, the book is either [[reprint]]ed or becomes [[out of print]]. Some [[print on demand]] and [[e-book]] publishers keep all their books perpetually "in print".

A "second" is an imperfect or damaged copy/impression which is set aside from the other copies/impressions of a printing. These will usually have their [[dust jacket]] clipped or marked in some way to designate their inferiority.

Sometimes readers may observe an error in the text of a book and report it to the publisher. The publisher usually records these '''reprint corrections''' in a file pending demand for a new printing, before which they are incorporated into the revised text. This is one of the factors that inserts the "substantially" into the definition of "substantially the same setting of type".

== Republication == &lt;!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[Republication]] redirects here. --&gt;
Many commercially successful books have been republished, either by their original or other imprints. For this reason if a popular book is searched for in a large bookseller such as [[Amazon.com]] or a large library catalog such as WorldCat, often an array of different copyright years, publishers, editions, formats (hardcover, softcover, trade, and mass market), and so forth are observed. Because no universal authority or convention determines the exact distinction between a "reprinting" and "republishing" and whether a republishing is a different "edition", the denotation of such denominations is ambiguous, at least at first glance.

==Legal status==

===UK===
Since 1956, typographical arrangements of published editions are protected by copyright law. ''[[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]'' defines a published edition to mean ''a published edition of the whole or any part of one or more literary, dramatic or musical works''.{{efn|Duration [[Directive (European Union)|Directive of the EU]] permits member states to create a publishers' right in critical and scientific works which have fallen into the [[public domain]].}}

It thus protects the publisher's investment in typesetting, as well as the processes of design and selection that are reflected in the appearance of the text.{{efn|See ''[[Newspaper Licensing Agency]] v. [[Marks &amp; Spencer]]'' [2000].}} It also covers modern editions of public domain works (such as the complete works of Shakespeare), and prohibits the reproduction of the layout (but not the work itself).

[[Music]] can be [[music analysis|analysed]] by considering a variety of its '''elements''', or [[property (philosophy)|parts]] (aspects, characteristics, features), individually or together. A commonly used list of the main elements includes pitch, timbre, texture, volume, duration and form. The elements of music may be compared to the [[elements of art]] or [[design elements and principles|design]].

==Selection of elements==

According to [[Howard Gardner|Howard]] {{harvtxt|Gardner|1983|loc=104}}, there is little dispute about the principal constituent elements of music, though experts differ on their precise definitions. Harold Owen bases his list on the qualities of sound: pitch, timbre, intensity, and duration {{harv|Owen|2000|loc=6}}. Most definitions of music include a reference to sound ({{harvnb| Google.com.au |2015}}; {{harvnb| Dictionary.com |2015}}; {{harvnb|Merriam-webster.com |2015}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003}}) and sound perception can be divided into six cognitive processes. They are: [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[duration (music)|duration]], [[loudness]], [[timbre]], [[texture (music)|sonic texture]] and  [[Sound localization|spatial location]] ({{harvnb|Burton|2015|loc=22–28}}).

A '''parameter''' is any element that can be manipulated ([[musical composition|composed]]) separately from other elements or focused on separately in an educational context.{{citation needed|date=June 2016|reason=bolded term}} [[Leonard B. Meyer]] compares distinguishing parameters within a culture by their different constraints to distinguishing independent parameters within music, such as melody, harmony, timbre, "etc." {{harv|Meyer|1989|loc=21n44}}. The first person to apply the term ''[[parameter]]'' to music may have been [[Joseph Schillinger]], though its relative popularity may be due to [[Werner Meyer-Eppler]] {{harv|Grant|2005|loc=62n85}}. ''Gradation'' is gradual change within one parameter, or an overlapping of two blocks of sound.

Meyer gives melody, rhythm, timbre, harmony, "and the like" {{harv|Meyer|1973|loc=9}}, while Narmour lists, melody, harmony, rhythm, dynamics, tessitura, timbre, tempo, meter, texture, "and perhaps others" {{harv|Narmour|1988|loc=326}}. According to McClellan, two things should be considered, the quality or state of an element and its change over time {{harv|McClellan|2000|loc=142}}. [[Alan P. Merriam|Alan P.]] {{harvtxt|Merriam|1964|loc=32–33}} proposed a theoretical research model that assumes three aspects are always present in musical activity: concept, behaviour, and sound. [[Virgil Thomson|Virgil]] {{harvtxt|Thomson|1957|loc=vii}} lists the "raw materials" of music in order of their supposed discovery: rhythm, melody, and harmony; including [[counterpoint]] and [[orchestration]]. Near the end of the twentieth century music scholarship began to give more attention to social and physical elements of music&lt;!-- (see Keller and Rieger 2009)--&gt; {{harv|Moran|2013|loc=59}}. For example: [[concert|performance]], [[sociomusicology|social]], [[women in music|gender]], [[dance]], and [[musical theater|theater]].

==Definition of music==
[[File:Circular definition of musicality.png|thumb|[[Circular definition]] of "musicality"]]
{{Main|Definition of music}}
Does the definition of music determine its aspects, or does the combination of certain aspects determine the definition of music? For example, [[intensional definition]]s list aspects or elements that make up their subject.

Some definitions refer to music as a score, or a composition ({{harvnb| Dictionary.com |2015}}; {{harvnb| Merriam-webster.com |2015}}; {{harvnb| Oxforddictionaries.com}}): music can be read as well as heard, and a piece of music written but never played is a piece of music notwithstanding. The process of [[sight-reading|reading music]], at least for trained musicians, involves a process, called "inner hearing" or "audiation" by Gordon, where the music is heard in the mind as if it were being played {{harv|Gordon |1999}}. This suggests that while sound is often considered a required aspect of music, it may not be.

[[Jean Molino|Jean]] {{harvtxt|Molino|1975|loc=43}} points out that "any element belonging to the total musical fact can be isolated, or taken as a strategic variable of musical production." Nattiez gives as examples [[Mauricio Kagel]]'s ''Con Voce'' [with voice], where a masked trio silently mimes playing instruments. In this example sound, a common element, is excluded, while gesture, a less common element, is given primacy. However Nattiez goes on to say that despite special cases where sound is not immediately obvious (because it is heard in the mind): "sound is a minimal condition of the musical fact" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=43}}.

==Universal aspect==
{{anchor|Invariances}}{{anchor|Invariance}}
There is disagreement about whether some aspects of music are [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]], as well as whether the concept of music is universal. This debate often hinges on definitions. For instance, the fairly common assertion that "tonality" is a universal of all music may necessarily require an expansive definition of tonality. A [[pulse (music)|pulse]] is sometimes taken as a universal, yet there exist solo vocal and instrumental genres with free and improvisational rhythms no regular pulse {{harv|Johnson|2002|loc=62}}, one example being the [[alap]] section of an [[Indian classical music]] performance. Harwood questions whether a "cross-cultural musical universal" may be found in the music or in the making of music, including performance, hearing, conception, and education {{harv|Harwood|1976|loc=522}}.

One aspect that is important to bear in mind when examining multi-cultural associations, is that an English-language word (i.e. the word "music"), not a universal concept, is the object of scrutiny. For this reason it is important to approach apparently equivalent words in other languages with caution. Based on the many disparate definitions that can be found just in English language dictionaries ({{harvnb| Google.com.au |2015}}; {{harvnb| Dictionary.com |2015}}; {{harvnb|Merriam-webster.com |2015}}; {{harvnb|Music|1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003}}), it seems there is no agreement on what the word "Music" means in English,{{original research inline|date=June 2016}}&lt;!--Drawing a conclusion from comparing several dictionaries is Original Research.--&gt; let alone determining a potentially equivalent word from another culture.

Kenneth Gourlay describes how, since different cultures include different elements in their definitions of music, dance, and related concepts, translation of the words for these activities may split or combine them, citing Nigerian musicologist Chinyere Nwachukwu's definition of the Igbo term "nkwa" {{harv|Nwachukwu|1981|loc=59}} as an activity combining and/or requiring singing, playing musical instruments, and dancing {{harv|Gourlay|1984|loc=35}}. He then concludes that there exists "nonuniversality of music and the universality of nonmusic."

==Other terms==
Other terms used to discuss particular pieces include:
* [[Musical note|Note]]—an abstraction that refers to either a specific pitch or rhythm, or the written symbol
*[[chord (music)|Chord]]—a [[simultaneity]] of notes heard as some sort of unit
*[[Chord progression]]—a succession of chords ([[simultaneity succession]])

Within the field of [[anthropology]] and other [[social science]]s, [[ethnography]] is a form of research that relies on a range of sources of data, but usually tends to rely mainly on [[participant observation]]. However, the term also refers to the product of this type of research, which of course normally takes a textual form. As a result, ethnography is also sometimes seen as a ''genre of writing, one'' used to describe patterns of human social interaction in particular contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Works and Lives: The anthropologist as author|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=Stanford CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of ethnography, the term 'realism' is often used to refer to the assumptions that some kinds of ethnographic work make about the phenomena to be investigated, and how these are to be understood. However, 'ethnographic realism' has also been used to refer to a style of writing that narrates the author's experiences and observations as if the reader were witnessing or experiencing events first hand. A work written using ethnographic realism may be referred to as a '''realist ethnography''', and classified as a subgenre of ethnography.

==Styles of ethnographic realism==
George Marcus and Dick Cushman described and categorized realist ethnographies under certain characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marcus|first1=George|last2=Cushman|first2=Dick|title=Ethnographies as Texts|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=Jan 1, 1982|volume=11|pages=25–69|jstor=2155775|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.11.100182.000325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flocs appear as cloudy suspensions of cells floating in water, rather than attached to and growing on a surface like most biofilms. The floc typically is held together by a matrix of [[extracellular polymeric substance]] (EPS), which may contain variable amounts of [[polysaccharide]], [[protein]], and other biopolymers. The formation and the properties of flocs may affect the performance of industrial water treatment [[bioreactor|bioreactors]] such as [[activated sludge]] systems.

'''Forensic social work''' is the application of [[social work]] to questions and issues relating to law and legal systems. This specialty of the social work profession goes far beyond clinics and psychiatric hospitals for criminal defendants being evaluated and treated on issues of competency and responsibility. A broader definition includes social work practice which in any way is related to legal issues and litigation, both criminal and civil. [[Child custody]] issues, involving [[Legal separation|separation]], [[divorce]], [[neglect]], termination of parental rights, the implications of [[Child abuse|child]] and [[spousal abuse]], juvenile and adult justice services, corrections, and mandated treatment all fall under this definition. Forensic social worker may also be involved in policy or legislative development intended to improve social justice.

==Functions==
Functions of the forensic social work practitioner may include:

*'''Providing consultation, education, or training to:'''
** Criminal justice, juvenile justice, and correctional systems
** Lawmakers
** Law enforcement personnel
** Attorneys, law students, and paralegals
** Members of the public
*'''Diagnosis, treatment, and recommendations:'''
** Diagnosing, assessing, and treating criminal and juvenile justice populations
** Diagnosing, treating, or making recommendations about mental status, children's interests, incapacities, or inability to testify
** Serving as an expert witness
** Screening, evaluating, or treating law enforcement and other criminal justice personnel
*'''Other functions:'''

Forensic social work practitioners engage only in forensic activities within their areas of competence and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nofsw.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==

=== United Kingdom ===

The first appointed Psychiatric Social Worker in [[London]] was in 1936.  The British Association of [[Psychiatric]] Social Workers was inaugurated only in 1930. Most of the expertise in England and Wales has been concentrated within the Specialist Hospitals. – [[Ashworth Hospital|Ashworth]], [[Rampton Secure Hospital|Rampton]] and [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor]].  at Broadmoor Hospital the first qualified mental health [[social worker]] was not employed until 1969.

The Central Council for Training and Education in Social Work (which was responsible for promoting education and training in social work between 1971-2001) defined forensic social work as 
“social work with mentally disordered people who present, or are subject to, significant risk and as a consequence are, or could be, in contact with the criminal justice system…The key purpose of forensic social work is to hold in balance the protection of the public and the promotion of the quality of life of individuals and by working in partnership with relevant others to identify, assess and manage risk; identify and challenge discriminatory structures and practices; engage effectively and identify, develop and implement strategies.” &lt;ref&gt;Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work, 1995. Forensic social work.  Competence and workforce data.  London:  Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== America ===
Forensic social work has been done since at least 1899&lt;ref&gt;Brownell AR: Soc Work. 1999 Jul;44(4):359-69.&lt;/ref&gt; coming out in part, of the [[settlement house]] movement, and the expansion of urban charity work.

== Role of the social worker ==

The  social worker  bridges the gap between the two worlds of
hospital and community.

=== United States ===
In the United States the Forensic social worker has a variety of functions, including social assessments for various [[courts]] including [[Family court|Family Court]], and  providing assessments and aftercare for psychiatric hospitals.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the U.K. the forensic social worker has several duties, including applications for hospital admission and when necessary, arrange aftercare (under s.117 of the Mental Health Act 1983) and social assessments. Psychiatric [[Social Worker]]'s are now called Mental Health Professionals, Mental Health Social Worker, of if trained, an [[Approved Mental Health Professional]] are often located within Community Mental Health Team, hospital or based in the local authority. The social worker fulfills the role of the Social Supervisor to specify suitable accommodations for discharged patients, and to assess risk. They provide specialist social care reports to the Mental Health First Tier Tribunal.

The Department of Health in England currently identifies the following functions as being key to the social work role:
•	assessment;
•	care co-ordination;
•	report writing and presentation;
•	working with individuals and families;
•	working in collaboration with service users and carers;
•	undertaking social supervision with conditionally discharged patients and the supervision of those subject to supervision and in the case of those within forensic community teams, community treatment orders;
•	working with external agencies and multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPAs);
•	continuing professional development.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Health, 2016.  Forensic Mental Health Social Work: Capabilities Framework.  London: Department of Health.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social workers in the community are commonly appointed as 'social supervisors' to patients who are subject to conditional discharge has been discharge under section 41 of the Mental Health Act 1983.  Social supervisors support the person in the community but also provide regular reports to the Ministry of Justice about their progress and may recommend their recall back to hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, J., 2010. Social supervision, ethics and risk: an evaluation of how ethical frameworks might be applied within the social supervision process. British Journal of Social Work, 40(8), pp.2398-2413.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2900">The '''Galton Laboratory''' was a laboratory for research into [[eugenics]] and then into human [[genetics]] based at [[University College London]] in [[London]], England. It was originally established in 1904, and became part of UCL's biology department in 1996.

The ancestor of the Galton Laboratory was the Eugenics Record Office founded by [[Francis Galton]] in 1904. In 1907 the Office was reconstituted as the Galton Eugenics Laboratory as part of UCL and under the direction of [[Karl Pearson]] the Professor of Applied Mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Magnello, M.

The Laboratory published a series of memoirs and in 1925 Pearson created the Annals of Eugenics, which continues as the [[Annals of Human Genetics]]. The journal has always been edited at the Galton. Pearson was succeeded as Galton Professor by R. A. Fisher in 1934. The post-war Galton Professors were [[Lionel Penrose]] up to 1965, Harry Harris to 1976 and Bette Robson until 1994. [[J.B.S. Haldane]] held the Chair of Biometry here and was succeeded by [[Cedric Smith (statistician)|C.A.B. Smith]]. The Galton Laboratory became part of the Department of Biology in UCL in 1996. MRC Human Biochemical Genetics Unit was established by Harris in 1962. He was Hon. Director until he went to Philadelphia in 1976, and the Unit continued under the direction of David Hopkinson until its closure in October 2000.

'''Geoprofessions''' is a term coined by the Geoprofessional Business Association to connote various technical disciplines that involve engineering, earth and environmental services applied to below-ground (“subsurface”), ground-surface, and ground-surface-connected conditions, structures, or formations. The principal disciplines include, as major categories:
* [[geomatics engineering]]
* [[#Geotechnical-engineering specialties|geotechnical engineering]];
* [[#Engineering geology and other geology specialties|geology and engineering geology]];
* [[#Geological engineering|geological engineering]];
* [[#Geophysics|geophysics]];
* [[#Geophysical engineering|geophysical engineering]];
* [[#Environmental-science and environmental-engineering specialties|environmental science and environmental engineering]];
* [[#Construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET)|construction-materials engineering and testing]]; and
* [[#Other geoprofessional services|other geoprofessional services]].

Each discipline involves specialties, many of which are recognized through professional designations that governments and societies or associations confer based upon a person’s education, training, experience, and educational accomplishments. In the United States, engineers must be licensed in the state or territory where they practice engineering. Most states license geologists and several license environmental “site professionals.” Several states license engineering geologists and recognize geotechnical engineering through a geotechnical-engineering titling act.

==Geotechnical-engineering specialties==
{{main|Geotechnical engineering}}
Although geotechnical engineering is applied for a variety of purposes, it is essential to foundation design. As such, geotechnical engineering is applicable to every existing or new structure on the planet; every building and every highway, bridge, tunnel, harbor, airport, water line, reservoir, or other public work. Commonly, the geotechnical-engineering service comprises a study of subsurface conditions using various sampling, in-situ testing, and/or other site-characterization techniques. The instrument of professional service in those cases typically is a report through which geotechnical engineers relate the information they have been retained to provide, typically: their findings; their opinions about subsurface materials and conditions; their judgment about how the subsurface materials and conditions assumed to exist probably will behave when subjected to loads or used as building material; and their preliminary recommendations for materials usage or appropriate foundation systems, the latter based on their knowledge of a structure’s size, shape, weight, etc., and the subsurface/structure interactions likely to occur. [[Civil engineers]], [[structural engineers]], and [[architects]], feasibly among other members of the project team, apply the geotechnical findings and preliminary recommendations to take the structure’s design forward. They realize these preliminary recommendations are subject to change, however, because – as a matter of practical necessity related to the [[Observational method (geotechnics)|observational method]] inherent to geotechnical engineering – geotechnical engineers base their recommendations on the composition of samples taken from a tiny portion of a site whose actual subsurface conditions are unknowable before excavation, because they are hidden by earth and/or rock and/or water. For this reason, as a key component of a complete geotechnical engineering service, geotechnical engineers employ construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET) to observe subsurface materials as they are exposed through excavation. To help achieve economies on their clients’ behalf, geotechnical engineers assign their field representatives – specially educated and trained paraprofessionals – to observe the excavated materials and the excavations themselves in light of conditions the geotechnical engineers opined to exist. When differences are discovered, the geotechnical engineers evaluate the new findings and, when necessary, modify their design and construction recommendations. Because such changes could require other members of the design and construction team to modify their designs, specifications, and proposed methods, many owners have their geotechnical engineers serve as active members of the project team from project inception to conclusion, working with others to help ensure appropriate application of geotechnical information and judgments.

In other cases, geotechnical engineering goes beyond a study and construction recommendations to include design of soil and rock structures. The most common of these are the [[Road surface|pavements]] that make up our streets and highways, airport runways, and bridge and tunnel decks, among other paved improvements. Geotechnical engineers design the pavements in terms of the subgrade, subbase, and base layers of materials to be used, and the thickness and composition of each. Geotechnical engineers also design the earth-retention walls associated with structures such as levees, earthen dams, reservoirs, and landfills. In other cases, the design is applied to contain earth, via structures such as excavation-support systems and retaining walls. Sometimes referred to as geostructural engineering or geostructural design, these services are also intrinsic to [[hydraulic engineering]], [[Hydrogeological|hydrogeologic engineering]], [[coastal engineering]], geologic engineering and [[Civil engineering#Water resources engineering|water-resources engineering]]. Geotechnical-engineering design is also applied for structures such as tunnels, bridges, dams, and other structures beneath, on, or connected to the surface of the earth. Geotechnical engineering, like geology, engineering geology, and geologic engineering, also involves the specialties of [[rock mechanics]] and [[soil mechanics]], and often requires knowledge of [[geotextiles]] and [[geosynthetics]], as well as an array of instrumentation and monitoring equipment, to help ensure specified conditions are achieved and maintained.

[[Earthquake engineering]] and landslide detection, remediation, and prevention are geoprofessional services associated with specialized types of geotechnical engineering (as well as [[#Geophysics|geophysics]]; see below), as is forensic geotechnical engineering, a geoprofessional service applied to determine why a certain applicable type of event – usually a failure of some sort – occurred. (Virtually all geoprofessional services can be performed for forensic purposes, commonly as litigation-support/[[expert witness]] services.) [[Railway systems engineering|Railway-systems engineering]] is another type of specialized geotechnical engineering, as are the design of [[piers]] and [[Bulkhead (barrier)|bulkheads]], [[drydocks]], on-shore and off-shore [[Wind turbine|wind-turbine]] systems, and systems that stabilize [[oil platforms]] and other marine structures to the sea floor.

Geotechnical engineers have long been involved in [[sustainability]] initiatives, including  (among many others) the use of excavated materials; the safe application of contaminated subsurface materials; the recycling of asphalt, concrete, and building rubble and debris; and the design of [[permeable paving|permeable pavements]].

All [[Civil engineering|civil-engineering]] specialties and projects – roads and highways, bridges, rail systems, ports and other waterfront structures, airport terminals, etc. – require the involvement of geotechnical engineers and engineering, meaning that many civil-engineering pursuits are geoprofessional pursuits to a greater or lesser degree. However, geotechnical engineering has for centuries also been associated with [[military engineering]]; [[sappers]] (in general) and [[miners]] (whose tunneling design services (known as [[Mining (military)|landmining]] and [[Mining (military)|undermining]]) were used in military-siege operations).

==Engineering geology and other geology specialties==
{{main|Geology|Engineering geology}}
Engineering geologist.
(a) Elements of the engineering geologist specialty. 
The practice of engineering geology involves the interpretation, evaluation, analysis, and application of geological information and data to civil works. Geotechnical soil and rock units are designated, characterized, and classified, using standard engineering soil and rock classification systems. Relationships are interpreted between landform development, current and past geologic processes, ground and surface water, and the strength characteristics of soil and rock. Processes evaluated include both surficial processes (for example, slope, fluvial, and coastal processes), and deep-seated processes (for example, volcanic activity and seismicity). Geotechnical zones or domains are designated based on soil and rocked geological strength characteristics, common landforms, related geologic processes, or other pertinent factors. Proposed developmental modifications are evaluated and, where appropriate, analyzed to predict potential or likely changes in types and rates of surficial geologic processes. Proposed modifications may include such things as vegetation removal, using various types of earth materials in construction, applying loads to shallow or deep foundations, constructing cut or fill slopes and other grading, and modifying ground and surface water flow. The effects of surficial and deep-seated geologic processes are evaluated and analyzed to predict their potential effect on public health, public safety, land use, or proposed development.
(b) Typical engineering geologic applications and types of projects. Engineering geology is applied during all project phases, from conception through planning, design, construction, maintenance, and, in some cases, reclamation and closure. Planning-level engineering geologic work is commonly conducted in response to forest practice regulations, critical areas ordinances, and the State Environmental Policy Act. Typical planning-level engineering geologic applications include timber harvest planning, proposed location of residential and commercial developments and other buildings and facilities, and alternative route selection for roads, rail lines, trails, and utilities. Site-specific engineering geologic applications include cuts, fills, and tunnels for roads, trails, railroads, and utility lines; foundations for bridges and other drainage structures, retaining walls and shoring, dams, buildings, water towers, slope, channel and shoreline stabilization facilities, fish ladders and hatcheries, ski lifts and other structures; landings for logging and other work platforms; airport landing strips; rock bolt systems; blasting; and other major earthwork projects such as for aggregate sources and landfills.

While engineering geology is applicable principally to planning, design and construction activities, other specialties of geology are applied in a variety of geoprofessional specialty fields, such as [[mining geology]], [[petroleum geology]], and [[environmental geology]]. Note that mining geology and [[mining engineering]] are different geoprofessional fields.

==Geological engineering==
{{distinguish|Climate engineering}}
'''Geological engineering''' is a hybrid discipline that comprises elements of [[civil engineering]], [[mining engineering]], [[petroleum engineering]], and [[earth sciences]]. Geological engineers often become licensed as both engineers and geologists. There are thirteen geological-engineering (or '''geoengineering''') programs in the United States that are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET: (1) Colorado School of Mines, (2) Michigan Technological University, (3) Missouri University of Science and Technology, (4) Montana Tech of the University of Montana, (5) South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, (6) University of Alaska-Fairbanks, (7) [[University of Minnesota]] Twin Cities, (8) [[University of Mississippi]], (9) [[University of Nevada, Reno]] (10) University of North Dakota, (11) University of Texas at Austin, (12) University of Utah, and (13) University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Other schools offer programs or classes in geological engineering, including the [[University of Arizona]].

'''Geoengineering''' or '''geological engineering''', [[engineering geology]], and [[geotechnical engineering]] deal with the discovery, development, and production and use of subsurface earth resources, as well as the design and construction of [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]. Geoengineering is the application of [[geosciences]], where mechanics, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and geology are used to understand and shape our interaction with the earth.

Geoengineers work in areas of
# [[mining]], including surface and subsurface [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]]s, and [[rock burst]] mitigation
# energy, including [[hydraulic fracturing]] and [[Boring (earth)|drilling]] for exploration and production of water, oil, or gas
# infrastructure, including [[Rapid transit|underground transportation]] systems and isolation of [[nuclear waste|nuclear]] and [[hazardous waste]]s; and
# environment, including [[groundwater flow]], contaminant transport and remediation, and hydraulic structures.

Professional [[List of geoscience organizations|geoscience organizations]] such as the [[American Rock Mechanics Association]] or the [[Geo-Institute]] and academic degrees such as the bachelor of geoengineering accredited by [[ABET]] acknowledge the broad scope of work practiced by geoengineers and stress fundamentals of science and engineering methods for the solution of complex problems. Geoengineers study the mechanics of rock, [[soil mechanics|soil]], and fluids to improve the sustainable use of earth’s finite resources, where problems appear with competing interests, for example, groundwater and waste isolation, [[Offshore drilling|offshore]] [[oil drilling]] and risk of spills, natural gas production and [[induced seismicity]].

==Geophysics==
{{main|Geophysics|Exploration geophysics}}
Geophysics is the study of the physical properties of the earth using quantitative physical methods to determine what lies beneath the earth's surface.  The physical properties of concern include the propagation of elastic waves (seismic), magnetism, gravity, electrical resistivity/conductivity, and electromagnetism.  Geophysics has historically been most commonly used in oil exploration and mining, but its popularity in non-destructive investigative work has flourished since the early 1990s.  It is also used in groundwater exploration and protection, geo-hazard studies (e.g., faults and landslides), alignment studies (e.g., proposed roadway, underground utilities, and pipelines), foundation studies, contamination characterization and remediation, landfill investigations, unexploded-ordnance investigations, vibration monitoring, dam-safety evaluation, location of underground storage tanks, identification of subsurface voids, and assisting in archeological investigations. (definition from Association of Environmental &amp; Engineering Geologists)

==Geophysical engineering==
'''Geophysical engineering''' is the application of geophysics to the engineering design of facilities including roads, tunnels, and mines.

==Environmental-science and environmental-engineering specialties==
{{main|Environmental science|Environmental engineering}}
Environmental science and environmental engineering are the geoprofessions commonly associated with the identification, remediation, and prevention of environmental contamination. These services range from phase-one and phase-two [[Environmental Site Assessment|environmental site-assessments]] – research designed to assess the likelihood that a property is contaminated and subsurface exploration conducted to identify the nature and extent of contamination, respectively – up through the design of processes and systems to remediate contaminated sites for the protection of human health and the environment.

[[Environmental geology]] is one of the principal geoprofessions engaged in assessing and remediating contaminated sites. Environmental geologists help identify the subsurface [[stratigraphy]] in which contaminants are located and through which they migrate. [[Environmental chemistry]] is the geoprofession that encompasses the study of chemical compounds in the soil.  These compounds are categorized as pollutants or contaminants when introduced into the environment by human factors (e.g., waste, mining processes, radioactive release) and are not of natural origin. Environmental chemistry assesses interactions or these compounds with soil, rock, and water to determine their fate and transport, the techniques to measure the levels of contaminants in the environment, and technologies to destroy or reduce the toxicity of contaminants in wastes or compounds that have been released to the environment. [[Environmental engineering]] is often applied to assess contaminated sites, but more often is used in the design of systems to remediate contaminated soil and groundwater.

[[Hydrogeology]] is the geoprofession involved when environmental studies involve subsurface water. Hydrogeology applications range from securing safe, plentiful underground drinking-water sources to identifying the nature of groundwater contamination in order to facilitate remediation. [[Environmental toxicology]] is a geoprofession when used to identify the source, fate, transformation, effects, and risks of pollutants on the environment, including soil, water, and air. [[Society of Wetland Scientists|Wetlands science]] is a geoprofessional pursuit that incorporates several scientific disciplines, such as [[botany]], [[biology]], and [[limnology]]. It involves, among other activities, the delineation, conservation, restoration, and preservation of wetlands. These services are sometimes conducted by geoprofessional specialists called [[Society of Wetland Scientists|wetlands scientists]]. [[Ecology]] is a closely related environmental geoprofession involving studies into the distribution of organisms and biodiversity within an environmental context.
 
Numerous geoprofessional disciplines contribute to the redevelopment of [[brownfields]], sites (typically urban) that are underused or abandoned because they are or are assumed to be contaminated by hazardous materials. Geoprofessionals are engaged to evaluate the degree to which such sites are contaminated and the steps that can be taken to achieve the sites’ safe reuse. Environmental engineers and scientists work with developers to identify and design remediation strategies and exposure-barrier designs that protect future site users from unacceptable exposure to environmental contamination resulting from previous uses of the site. Because these previous uses often resulted in degraded soil conditions and the presence of abandoned, underground structures, geotechnical engineers often are needed to design special foundations for the new structures.

==Construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET)==
Construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET) comprises an array of licensed-engineer-directed professional services applied principally for purposes of construction quality assurance and quality control. CoMET services commonly are provided as a separate discipline by firms that also practice geotechnical engineering, possibly among other geoprofessional disciplines. The geoprofessional-service industry has evolved in this manner because geotechnical engineering employs the observational method. [[Karl von Terzaghi]] and [[Ralph B. Peck]] – the creators of modern geotechnical engineering – used the [[Observational method (geotechnics)|observational method]] and multiple working hypotheses to expedite and economize the subsurface-exploration process, by using sampling and testing to form a judgment about subsurface conditions, and then observing excavated conditions and materials to confirm or modify those judgments and related recommendations, and then finalize them. To economize still further, geoprofessionals educated and trained paraprofessionals to represent them on site (hence the term “field representative”), especially to apply their judgment (much as a geotechnical engineer would) in comparing observed conditions with those the geotechnical engineer believed would exist. Over time, geotechnical engineers expanded their CoMET services by providing the additional education and training their field representatives needed to evaluate constructors’ attainment of conditions commonly specified by geoprofessionals; e.g., subsurface preparation for foundations of buildings, roadways, and other structures; materials used for subgrade, subbase, and base purposes; site grading; construction of earthen structures (earth dams, levees, reservoirs, landfills, et al.) and earth-retaining structures (e.g., retaining walls); and so on. Because many of the materials involved, such as concrete, are used in other elements of construction projects and structures, geoprofessional firms expanded their field representatives’ skill sets still more, to encompass observation and testing of numerous additional materials (e.g., reinforced concrete, structural steel, masonry, wood, and fireproofing), processes (e.g., cutting and filling and rebar placement), and outcomes (e.g., the effectiveness of welds). Laboratory services are a common element of many CoMET operations. Also operating under the direction of a licensed engineer, they are applied in geotechnical engineering to evaluate subsurface-material samples. In overall CoMET operations, laboratories operate with the equipment and personnel required to evaluate a variety of construction materials.

CoMET services applied to evaluate the actual composition of a site’s subsurface are part of a complete geotechnical engineering service. For purposes of short-term economy, however, some owners select a firm not associated with the geotechnical engineer of record to provide these and all other CoMET services. This approach precludes the geotechnical engineer of record from providing a complete service. It also aggravates risk, because the individuals engaged to evaluate actual subsurface conditions are not “briefed” by the geotechnical engineer of record before they go to the project site and seldom communicate with the geotechnical engineer of record when they discern differences, in large part because the firm associated with the geotechnical engineer of record is regarded as a competitor of the firm employing the field representatives. In some cases, the field representatives in question lack the specific project background information and/or the education and training required to discern those differences.

CoMET services applied to evaluate constructor’s attainment of specified conditions take the form of quality-assurance (QA) or quality-control (QC) services. QA services are performed directly or indirectly for the owner. The owner specifies the nature and extent of QA services that the owner believes is appropriate. Some owners specify none at all or only those that may be required by law. Those required by law are imposed via a jurisdiction’s [[building code]]. Almost all U.S. jurisdictions base their building codes on “model codes” developed by associations of building officials. The [[International Code Council|International Code Council (ICC)]] is the most prominent of these groups and its [[International Building Code (IBC)]] is the most commonly used model. As a result, many jurisdictions now require IBC “Special Inspection,” a term defined by the IBC as “the required examination of the materials, installation, fabrication, erection, or placement of components and connections requiring special expertise to ensure compliance with approved construction documents and referenced standards.” Special Inspection requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction based on the provisions adopted by the local building official. While some of the services involved may be similar to or the same as conventional CoMET services, Special Inspection is handled differently. Most commonly, the owner or the owner’s agent is required to retain a building-official-approved Special Inspection-services provider. Special Inspection is often required to obtain a certificate of occupancy.

QC services are those applied by or on behalf of a constructor to ensure the constructor has attained conditions the constructor has contractually agreed to attain. Most CoMET consultants are engaged far more to provide QA services than QC services.

Many CoMET procedures are specified in standards developed by [[Standards organization#Standard-developing organizations .28SDOs.29|standards-developing organizations (SDOs)]] such as the [[American Society of Civil Engineers|American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)]], [[ASTM International]], and [[American Concrete Institute|American Concrete Institute (ACI)]], using standards-development protocols approved by the [[American National Standards Institute|American National Standards Institute (ANSI)]] and/or the [[International Organization for Standardization|International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]]. All such standards identify what is minimally required to conform. Likewise, several organizations have developed programs to accredit CoMET field and laboratory services to perform certain types of testing and inspection. Some of these programs are more comprehensive than others; e.g., requiring regular calibration of equipment, participation in proficiency testing programs, and implementation and documentation of a (quality) management system to demonstrate technical competence. As with all such programs, of course, accreditation identifies what is least acceptable. Many CoMET laboratories go far beyond minimum requirements in an effort to attain higher levels of quality.

A variety of organizations – including local building departments – have developed personnel-certification protocols and requirements. In many jurisdictions, only appropriately certified individuals are permitted to perform certain evaluations. Individuals typically are required to meet certain prerequisites for certification and must pass examinations, in some cases involving performance observation in the field. The prerequisite for higher degrees of certification often include a requirement that the individual has met requirements for a lower degree of certification (e.g., Soils Technician I is in some cases a prerequisite for Soils Technician II). It should be noted that field representatives are sometimes referred to as “soil testers,” “technicians,” “technicians/technologists,” or “engineering technicians.” The Geoprofessional Business Association developed the term “field representative” to encompass all the many types of paraprofessionals involved (e.g., those involved with specific types of materials, such as reinforced concrete, soil, or steel; those who observe or inspect processes or conditions, such as welding inspectors, caisson inspectors, and foundation inspectors), and especially to underscore their significant, mutual responsibility, that purpose titles such as “technician” fail to signify. In fact, the engineers who direct CoMET operations are personally and professionally responsible and liable for their field representatives’ acts and statements while representing the engineer on site.

Especially because CoMET consultants have more hands-on experience with construction activities than many other design-team members, many owners involve them (among other geoprofessionals) from the outset of a project, during the design phase, to help the owner and/or design team members develop technical specifications and establish testing and inspection requirements, instrumentation requirements and procedures, and observation programs. Geotechnical engineers employ CoMET services during the earliest stages of a project, to oversee subsurface sampling procedures, such as drilling.

Many of the CoMET services performed for construction projects are performed for environmental projects as well, but requirements tend to be less rigid because they involve fewer licensing and related requirements. For example, individuals may perform federally mandated all-appropriate inquiries – typically a phase-one environmental site assessment – without a license of any kind.

==Other geoprofessional services==
To the extent that [[archeology]] and [[paleontology]] require systematic subsurface excavation to recover artifacts, they, too, are considered geoprofessions. Many geoprofessional-services firms offer these services to those of their clients that need to satisfy federal and/or state regulations that require paleontological and/or archeological inquiry before site development or redevelopment activities can proceed.

The term '''global village''' represents the [[approximation|simplifying]] of the whole world into one village through the use of [[electronic media]]. ''Global village'' is also a term to express the constituting relationship between [[socioeconomics|economics and other social sciences]] throughout the world. The term was coined by Canadian [[media theorist]], [[Marshall McLuhan]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Wyndham Lewis]]'s ''America and Cosmic Man'' (1948) and [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' are sometimes credited as the source of the phrase, but neither used the words "Global Village" as it is. According to M. McLuhan's son [[Eric McLuhan]], his father, a Joyce scholar and a close friend of Lewis, likely discussed the concept with Lewis during their association, but there is no evidence that he got the idea or the phrasing from either; McLuhan is generally credited as having coined the term.

McLuhan described how electric technology  has contracted the globe into a village&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. ''Understanding Media''. (Gingko Press, 1964, 2003) p 6.&lt;/ref&gt; because of the instantaneous movement of information from every quarter to every point at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. ''Letters of Marshall McLuhan''. (Oxford University Press, 1987) p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview ==

Marshall McLuhan, who was a Canadian philosopher, invented the word in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Golovine |first1=Mila |title=Global Village: Where Cultures Connect |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mila-golovine/global-village-where-cult_b_5035779.html |website=Huffingtonpost.com |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan based his concept on the idea that cultures would focus on communicating and move towards personal interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hendricks |first1=Beth |title=Marshall McLuhan &amp; the Global Village Concept |url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/marshall-mcluhan-the-global-village-concept.html |website=study.com |publisher=study.com |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;The term global village means different parts of the world that form one community that’s linked by the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of 'global village' |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/global-village |website=Collins dictionary |publisher=Collins dictionary |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of communication such as Skype allow us to communicate and connect with others, especially others in other countries, easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yew |first1=Lee |title=The World Is Truly A Global Village |url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2012/0326/current-events-singapore-world-truly-global-village-lee-kuan-yew.html#1b4fc3187fc4 |website=forbes.com |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


The new reality of the [[digital age]] has implications for forming new socially meaningful structures within the context of [[culture]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essential McLuhan|last=Mcluhan|first=Eric|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1995|isbn=0-465-01995-1|location=Concord, Ont. : Anansi|pages=7–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interchanging messages, stories, opinions, posts, and videos through channels on telecommunication pathways can cause miscommunication-- especially through different cultures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378720608000153|title=Cultural diversity and information and communication technology impacts on global virtual teams|last=Shachaf|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.im.2007.12.003|volume=45|journal=Information &amp; Management|pages=131–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary analysts question the causes of changes in community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Often they speculate about whether or not the consequences of these changes could lead to some new sociological structure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Most of them have pointed out that the increased velocity of transactions has fostered international density, making [[social network]]s a catalyst for [[social change]].

Across the global village people have reached out and transcended their neighborhoods. They are involved in a complex community of networks stretching across cities, nations, oceans, and governments. Yet at the same time the increasing communications with friends on [[social media]] may also increase the density of interconnections within already existing social clusters. The global village's implications on sociological structures are yet to be fully realized.&lt;ref&gt;''The Network Community: An Introduction to Networks and Global Village'', By: Barry Wellman&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does multimedia have the ability to impact individuals differently for cultural reasons, but messages also affect people due to their religion, politics, beliefs, business, money etc.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The time in which messages are received also affects how a message is understood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Marshall McLuhan’s time, the global village was already apparent. It was already a comprehensive and seminal way to grasp what was happening to the world at large at any time (and correspondingly, what should be done with this in mind): "The global village absolutely ensures maximal disagreement on all points" (McLuhan: Hot &amp; Cool. New York: The New American Library, p.&amp;nbsp;272).

During the primitive years, people primarily stayed in tune with the simultaneous mode of their perception and thinking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Today human society struggles neurologically, with the simultaneous mode taking the upper hand once again.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
Our brains are constantly adapting and morphing to the modifications of [[technological advancement]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through technology, the creation of social media allows people to constantly comment on each other's posts as well as creating them to share with the multi-media global world. 55% of teens possess a social media account.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medialit.org/|title=Center for Media Literacy|website=www.medialit.org|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social media has connected people with jobs that they couldn’t have received before because of their geographic location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediacritiques.net|title=Journal of Media Critiques [JMC]|website=www.mediacritiques.net|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; New social medias have connected the world so that users can learn more about cultures different from their own through interactions on social media as well as maintaining relationships from opposing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rebecca|first=Sawyer,|date=2011-01-01|title=The Impact of New Social Media on Intercultural Adaptation|url=http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/srhonorsprog/242/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global village and media ==
People use technology to fit into a [[digital community]] to which they aren't physically connected, but mentally connected. Each [[social media platform]] acts as a digital home for individuals, allowing people to express themselves through the global village.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  A Review of General Semantics argues that media ecology and new media have expanded who has the ability to create and view media texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valcanis|first=Tom|date=|year=2011|title=An iPhone in Every Hand: Media Ecology, Communication Structures, and the Global Village|url=|journal=ETC: A Review of General Semantics|volume=68|pages=33–45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since mass media began, it has called for the westernization of the world, hence the global village.  Without the mass media in effect countries like India or Turkey wouldn’t be living [[American way|American lifestyle]] because they wouldn’t have the knowledge of what the acquisitions of the American nation constitute. Since most of the developing countries acquired the news and entertainment from developed nations like the U.S, the information received is biased in favor of developed nations which connects the world in similarities within the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M|first=Kraidy, Marwan|date=2002-01-01|title=Globalization of Culture Through the Media|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/asc_papers/325/|journal=Encyclopedia of Communication and Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Internet, physical distance is even less of a hindrance to the real-time communicative activities of people. Social Spheres are greatly expanded by the openness of the web and the ease at which people can search for online communities and interact with others who share the same interests and concerns. According to McLuhan, the enhanced "electric speed in bringing all social and political functions together in a sudden implosion has heightened human awareness of responsibility to an intense degree." &lt;ref name="UnderstandingMedia"&gt;''Understanding Media'', McGraw Hill, 1964, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; Increased speed of communication and the ability for people to read about, spread, and react to global news quickly, forces us to become more involved with others from various social groups and countries around the world and to be more aware of our global responsibilities.&lt;ref name="UnderstandingMedia" /&gt; Similarly, web-connected computers enable people to link their web sites together.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Global theater==
No chapter in ''Understanding Media'', later books, contains the idea that the global village and the electronic media create unified communities. In an interview with Gerald Stearn,&lt;ref&gt;Stearn, Gerald Emmanuel. ''McLuhan: Hot &amp; Cool'' (1968), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan says that it never occurred to him that uniformity and tranquility were the properties of the global village. McLuhan argued that the global village ensures maximal disagreement on all points because it creates more discontinuity and division and [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] under the increase of the village conditions. The global village is far more diverse.
 
After the publication of ''Understanding Media'', McLuhan starts using the term ''global theater'' to emphasize the changeover from consumer to producer, from acquisition to involvement, from job holding to role playing, stressing that there is no more community to clothe the naked specialist.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall and Nevitt, Barrington. ''From Take Today: The Executive as Dropout'' (Harcourt Brace, 1972) p 265 and back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ikaria Study''' is a small-scale survey by  the [[University of Athens]] School of Medicine of the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and lifestyle of  [[Greek people]] over age 80 on the island of Ikaria.&lt;ref name="DAN BUETTNER"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that the Ikarian diet includes [[olive oil]], [[red wine]], [[fish]], [[coffee]], [[herbal tea]], [[honey]], potatoes, [[garbanzo bean]]s, [[black-eyed pea]]s, [[lentils]], and a  limited amount of meat, sugar and [[dairy products]],  except [[goat milk]].&lt;ref name="DAN BUETTNER" /&gt;

The data showed that people on Ikaria were  reaching the age of 90 at 2.5 times the rate Americans do, and that  Ikarian men   are almost four times as likely as American men to reach age 90.&lt;ref name="DAN BUETTNER" /&gt;

'''Lakeland University''' is a [[liberal arts college]] with its main campus located in [[Plymouth, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/news/2018/05/25/lakeland-university-launching-food-safety-and.html|title=Lakeland University launching food safety and quality major based on employer demand|last=Leary|first=Patrick|date=25 May 2018|website=www.bizjournals.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lakeland University is affiliated with the [[United Church of Christ]] and offers both undergraduate and graduate degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lakeland.edu/About-Us/about-us|title=About Us|website=lakeland.edu|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lakeland also has seven evening, weekend, and online centers located throughout the state of Wisconsin—in [[Milwaukee]], [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin|Wisconsin Rapids]], [[Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin|Chippewa Falls]], [[Neenah, Wisconsin|Neenah]], [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], and [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]]—and a two-year international campus in [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://okinawa.stripes.com/education/lakeland-college-japan-acquires-university-status|title=Lakeland College Japan Acquires University Status {{!}} Stripes Okinawa|date=2016-06-28|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Lakeland traces its beginnings to German immigrants who, seeking a new life, traveled to America and settled in the Sheboygan area.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2010/02/22/focus24.html|title=Lakeland College|last=|first=|date=21 February 2010|website=www.bizjournals.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here are some milestones in the college’s history:
* In 1862, the founders built Missionshaus (Mission House), a combined academy-college-seminary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The school was called Mission House College and Seminary until 1956 when it adopted the name Lakeland College.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fox11online.com/news/local/lakeshore/lakeland-college-to-be-called-lakeland-university|title=Lakeland College to be called Lakeland University|last=News|first=FOX 11|work=WLUK|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1956, the college adopted the name Lakeland and began focusing on a liberal arts education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The seminary combined with the Yankton Theological School to become United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities and relocated to Minneapolis/St. Paul in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS1773|title=Reformed Churches in Wisconsin {{!}} Wisconsin Historical Society|date=2012-08-03|work=Wisconsin Historical Society|access-date=2018-08-23|language=Sheboygan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1978, Lakeland launched the state’s first degree-completion program for working adults by offering evening classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hngnews.com/sun_prairie_star/community/article_5f8032d0-f04e-5a7b-b7a7-7d449426148a.html|title=Lakeland College celebrates 30 years of adult education at Madison Center|work=Hometown News LP|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Lakeland’s Evening, Weekend &amp; Online program enrolls more than 2,000 graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/lcmuskies/docs/lakeland-fall-2016|title=Lakeland Fall 2016|work=Issuu|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1991, Lakeland founded a campus in Tokyo, Japan and in 2005 it was recognized as an overseas campus, allowing it to sponsor visas for students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* On July 1, 2016, Lakeland College became Lakeland University. This change resulted in the creation of three schools, a School of Business &amp; Entrepreneurship; a School of Science, Technology &amp; Education; and a School of Humanities and Fine Arts as well as new academic offerings. The change was fueled by many factors, including desire to increase international recruitment and clear up confusion with [[Lakeshore Technical College]], a neighboring institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lakeland.edu/Lakeland-News/lakeland-college-to-become-lakeland-university-on-july-1|title=Lakeland College to become Lakeland University on July 1|website=lakeland.edu|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of all [[sovereign state]]s and [[dependent territory|dependencies]] by [[total fertility rate]] (TFR): the expected number of children born per woman in her child-bearing years.

== Methodology ==
The [[World Bank]] ranking list is based on the data for the year 2016 published online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?year_high_desc=true|title=Fertility rate, total (births per woman) - Data|author=|date=|website=data.worldbank.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank is a [[United Nations]] [[international financial institution]], a component of the [[World Bank Group]], and a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]], but it also collects and analyses information on demography issues based on international and national sources: (1) United Nations Population Division. World Population Prospects, (2) United Nations Statistical Division. Population and Vital Statistics Report (various years), (3) Census reports and other statistical publications from national statistical offices, (4) Eurostat: Demographic Statistics, (5) Secretariat of the Pacific Community: Statistics and Demography Programme, and (6) U.S. Census Bureau: International Database.

The [[Population Reference Bureau]] (PRB) ranking list is based on the data of the ''2018 World Population Data Sheet&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prb.org/2018-world-population-data-sheet-with-focus-on-changing-age-structures/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.prb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018_WPDS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;'' published online.
The [[Population Reference Bureau]] (PRB)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Population Reference Bureau |url=http://www.prb.org/ |title=Population Reference Bureau |publisher=Prb.org |date= |accessdate=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a private, nonprofit organization which informs people around the world about population, health and the environment for research or academic purposes. It was founded in 1929. World Population Data Sheets are double-sided wallcharts (now published online) that present detailed information on demographic, health and environment indicators for more than 200 countries.

The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] ranking list is sourced from the CIA World Factbook&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/fields/356rank.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/fields/356.html&lt;/ref&gt; unless otherwise specified. [[List of sovereign states|Sovereign states]] and [[country|countries]] are ranked. Some countries might not be listed because they are not fully recognized as countries at the time of this census.

The [[Our World In Data]] (OWID) ''Country ranking and comparison by TFR: 1950 and 2015'' list is sourced and based on the OWID website (on the clickable map and quoted sources).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ourworldindata.org/fertility/|title=Fertility Rate|author=|date=|website=Our World in Data|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ourworldindata.org/|title=Our World in Data|author=|date=|website=Our World in Data|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Our World In Data]] (OWID) is an [[online publication]] that presents empirical research and data that show how living conditions around the world are changing. The aim is to show how the world is changing and why. The publication is developed at the [[University of Oxford]] and authored by social historian and development economist [[Max Roser]].

The World Bank ''Country ranking and comparison by TFR: 1960 and 2015'' list is sourced and based on the online published demographic data of the World Bank web site (on the clickable map and quoted sources).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN|title=Fertility rate, total (births per woman) - Data|author=|date=|website=data.worldbank.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Loudness monitoring''' of [[programme levels]] is needed in [[radio]] and [[television]] [[broadcasting]], as well as in [[audio post production]]. Traditional methods of measuring signal levels, such as the [[Peak programme meter]] and [[VU meter]], do not give the subjectively valid measure of [[loudness]] that many would argue is needed to optimise the listening experience when changing channels or swapping disks.

The need for proper loudness monitoring is apparent in the [[loudness war]] that is now found everywhere in the audio field, and the extreme compression that is now applied to [[programme levels]].

==Loudness meters==
Meters have been introduced that aim to measure the human perceived loudness by taking account of the [[equal-loudness contours]] and other factors, such as audio spectrum, duration, compression and intensity. One such device was developed by [[CBS Laboratories]] in the 1980s. Complaints to broadcasters about the intrusive level of interstitials programs (advertisements, commercials) has resulted in projects to develop such meters. Based on loudness metering, many manufacturers have developed real-time audio processors that adjust the audio signal to match a specified target loudness level that preserves volume consistency at home listeners.

==EBU Mode meters==
In August 2010, the European Broadcasting Union published a new metering specification [http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3341.pdf EBU Tech 3341], which builds on [[ITU-R BS.1770]]. To make sure meters from different manufacturers provide the same reading in [[LUFS]] units, [http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3341.pdf EBU Tech 3341] specifies the 'EBU Mode', which includes a Momentary (400 ms), Short term (3s) and Integrated (from start to stop) meter and a [http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/testmaterial/ebu-loudness-test-setv03.zip set of audiosignals] to test the meters.

The '''Met Office''' (officially the '''Meteorological Office''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb261-nationalmeteorologicalarchive | title=Meteorological Office Archive | accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the United Kingdom's national weather service. It is an [[executive agency]] and [[trading fund]] of the [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]] led by acting CEO&lt;ref name="CEO2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/met-office-chief-executive-stands-down|publisher=Gov.uk|title=Met Office Chief Executive stands down|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Nick Jobling and chief scientist, Stephen Belcher. [[Penelope Endersby]] will take over as Chief Executive in December 2018, the first woman to do so.&lt;ref name="Endersby"/&gt; The Met Office makes meteorological predictions across all timescales from weather forecasts to [[climate change]].

== History ==
[[File:Robert_Fitzroy.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy founder of the Met Office]] The Met Office was established in 1854 as a small department within the [[Board of Trade]] under Vice-Admiral [[Robert FitzRoy]] as a service to [[sailor|mariners]]. The loss of the passenger vessel, the [[Royal Charter (ship)|''Royal Charter'']], and 459 lives off the coast of [[Anglesey]] in a violent storm in October 1859 led to the first gale warning service. FitzRoy established a network of 15 coastal stations from which visual gale warnings could be provided for ships at sea.

The new [[electric telegraph]] enabled rapid dissemination of warnings and also led to the development of an observational network which could then be used to provide synoptic analysis. The Met Office started in 1861 to provide weather forecasts to newspapers.  FitzRoy requested the daily traces of the photo-[[barograph]] at [[Kew Observatory]] (invented by [[Francis Ronalds]]) to assist in this task and similar barographs and as well as instruments to continuously record other meteorological parameters were later provided to stations across the observing network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-78326-917-4|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=June 2016|title=Sir Francis Ronalds and the Early Years of the Kew Observatory|url=|journal=Weather|doi=10.1002/wea.2739|pmid=|access-date=|volume=71|pages=131–134|bibcode=2016Wthr...71..131R}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Publication of forecasts ceased in May 1866 after FitzRoy’s death but recommenced in April 1879.

=== Connection with the Ministry of Defence ===
[[File:The Meteorological Office, Bracknell - geograph.org.uk - 489065.jpg|thumbnail|right|Former Met Office building in Bracknell, Berkshire before relocation to Exeter, since demolished]]
Following the [[First World War]], the Met Office became part of the [[Air Ministry]] in 1919, the weather observed from the top of [[Adastral House]] (where the Air Ministry was based) giving rise to the phrase "The weather on the Air Ministry roof". As a result of the need for weather information for aviation, the Met Office located many of its observation and data collection points on [[List of Royal Air Force stations|RAF airfields]], and this accounts for the large number of military airfields mentioned in weather reports even today. In 1936 the Met Office split with services to the [[Royal Navy]] being provided by its own forecasting services.

It became an [[executive agency]] of the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in April 1990, a quasi-governmental role, being required to act commercially.

===Change in ownership===

Following a [[machinery of government]] change, the Met Office became part of the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] on 18 July 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clickgreen.org.uk/news/national-news/122350-uk-met-office-switches-departments-in-whitehall-shake-up.html|title=UK Met Office switches departments in Whitehall shake-up|publisher=Clickgreen.org.uk|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently part of the [[Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]] following the merger of BIS and the [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] on 14 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Machinery of Government Changes:Written statement - HCWS94|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-07-18/HCWS94|website=Hansard|publisher=Hansard|date=18 July 2016|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no longer part of the MOD, the Met Office maintains strong links with the military through its front line offices at RAF and Army bases both in the UK and overseas and its involvement in the Joint Operations Meteorology and Oceanography Centre (JOMOC) with the Royal Navy.  The [[Mobile Meteorological Unit|Mobile Met Unit]] (MMU) are a unit consisting of Met Office staff who are also [[RAF Reserve|RAF reservists]] who accompany forward units in times of conflict advising the armed forces of the conditions for battle, particularly the RAF.

== Locations ==
[[File:Ukmo-exeter-panorama.JPG|thumb|The 2003 headquarters building on the edge of Exeter]]

In September 2003 the Met Office moved its headquarters from [[Bracknell]] in Berkshire to a purpose-built £80m structure at [[Exeter]] Business Park, near junction 29 of the [[M5 motorway]]. The new building was officially opened on 21 June 2004 – a few weeks short of the Met Office's 150th anniversary – by [[Robert May, Baron May of Oxford]]. 

It has a worldwide presence{{spaced ndash}}including a forecasting centre in [[Aberdeen]], and offices in [[Gibraltar]] and on the [[Falklands]].  Other outposts lodge in establishments such as the [http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/Research/jcmm/jcmm.html Joint Centre for Mesoscale Meteorology] (JCMM) at [[University of Reading]] in Berkshire, the [http://www.jchmr.org/ Joint Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Research] (JCHMR) site at [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] in Oxfordshire, and there is a Met Office presence at Army and Air Force bases within the UK and abroad (including frontline units in conflict zones).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/defence/mmu.html |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070705161546/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/defence/mmu.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 July 2007 |title=Met Office defence: Supporting operations |publisher=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |date=13 May 2014 |accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Royal Navy]] weather forecasts are generally provided by naval officers, not Met Office personnel.

== Forecasts ==

=== Shipping forecast ===
{{main article|Shipping Forecast}}
The [[Shipping Forecast]] is produced by the Met Office and broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]], for those traversing the seas around the [[British Isles]].

=== Weather forecasting and warnings ===
The Met Office issues Severe Weather Warnings for the United Kingdom through the [[National Severe Weather Warning Service]] (NSWWS). These warn of weather events that may affect transport infrastructure and endanger people's lives.  In March 2008, the system was improved and a new stage of warning was introduced, the 'Advisory'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/uk/guide/colour_warnings.html |title=Met Office warning colours |publisher=Metoffice.gov.uk |date=19 November 2008 |accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015 the Met Office established a "name our storms" project, the aim is to provide a single authoritative naming system for the storms that affect the UK and Ireland by asking the public to suggest names. On 10 November, the first named storm was [[Storm Abigail|Abigail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/news/releases/archive/2015/storm-Abigail |title=10 November 2015 - The Met Office has named Abigail as the first storm as part of the Name Our Storms project. |publisher=Met Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weather prediction models ===
The main role of the Met Office is to produce forecast models by gathering information from [[weather satellite]]s in space and observations on earth, then processing it with a variety of models, based on a software package known as the [[unified model]]. The principal weather products for UK customers are 36-hour forecasts from the operational 1.5&amp;nbsp;km resolution [[Unified Model#UKV model|UKV model]] covering the UK and surroundings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/91Annual/webprogram/Paper177409.html |title=Experiences with a 1.5&amp;nbsp;km version of the Met Office Unified Model for short range forecasting |publisher=ametsoc.org |date=25 January 2011 |accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (replacing the 4&amp;nbsp;km model), 48-hour forecasts from the 12&amp;nbsp;km resolution NAE model covering Europe and the North Atlantic, and 144-hour forecasts from the 25&amp;nbsp;km resolution global model (replacing the 40&amp;nbsp;km global model).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/unified-model/weather-forecasting |title=Met Office Atmospheric numerical model configurations |publisher=Metoffice.gov.uk |date=5 May 2010 |accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Met Office's Global Model forecast has consistently been in the top 3 for global weather forecast performance (in the decades up to 2010) in independent verification to WMO standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecmwf.int/publications/library/do/references/show?id=89984 |title=Verification statistics and evaluations of ECMWF forecasts in 2009–2010 – Figures 11–15 |date=October 2010 |accessdate=10 February 2011 |publisher=European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts ecmwf.int }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2013}} Products for other regions of the globe are sold to customers abroad, provided for [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MOD]] operations abroad or provided free to developing countries in Africa. If necessary, forecasters may make adjustments to the computer forecasts. Data is stored in the Met Office's own [[PP-format]].

===Flood Forecasting Centre===
{{main article|Flood Forecasting Centre}}
Formed in 2009, the [[Flood Forecasting Centre]] (FFC) is a joint venture between the [[Environment Agency]] and the Met Office to provide flood risk guidance for England and Wales. The Centre is jointly staffed from both parent organisations and is based in the Operations Centre at the Met Office headquarters in Exeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exeterscience.org/news/33/129/Flood-Forecasting-Centre-moves-to-Exeter.html|title=Flood Forecasting Centre moves to Exeter|publisher=Exeter Science|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland this role is performed by the Scottish Flood Forecasting Service, a joint venture between the [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency]] (SEPA) and the Met Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sepa.org.uk/flooding/flood_forecasting_service.aspx|title=Scottish Flood Forecasting Service|publisher=Sepa.org.uk|accessdate=4 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seasonal forecasts ===
The Met Office makes seasonal and long range forecasts and distributes them to customers and users globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Long-range global and regional forecasts|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/seasonal-to-decadal/long-range/forecasts|website=Met Office|accessdate=21 July 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Met Office was the first climate and weather forecast provider to be recognised as a Global Producing Centre of long range forecasts by the [[World Meteorological Organisation]] and continues to provide forecasts to the WMO for dissemination to other national meteorological services worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate research at the Met Office Hadley Centre|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/mohippo/pdf/b/1/informing.pdf|publisher=Met Office|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Met Office research has broken new ground in seasonal forecasting for the [[extratropics]] and has demonstrated its abilities in its seasonal predictions of the [[North Atlantic Oscillation]] and winter climate for Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014GL059637/abstract | title=Seasonal Predictions of the North Atlantic Oscillation | doi=10.1002/2014GL059637 | volume=41 | journal=Geophysical Research Letters | pages=2514–2519| bibcode=2014GeoRL..41.2514S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knapton|first1=Sarah|title=The Met Office can now predict winter weather one year in advance|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/2016/10/17/met-office-can-now-predict-winter-weather-one-year-in-advance/|work=The Telegraph|date=17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supply of forecasts for broadcasting companies ===
Two of the main media companies, the [[BBC]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] produce forecasts using the Met Office's data.

=== World Area Forecast Centre ===
{{main article|World Area Forecast Centre}}
The Met Office is one of only two World Area Forecast Centres or WAFCs, and is referred to as WAFC London. The other WAFC is located in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and known as WAFC Washington. WAFC data is used daily to safely and economically route aircraft, particularly on long-haul journeys. The data provides details of wind speed and direction, air temperature, cloud type and tops, and other features.

=== Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre ===
{{main article|Volcanic Ash Advisory Center}}
As part of its aviation forecast operation the Met Office operates the London [[Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre]] (VAAC).&lt;ref name=LVAAC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/aviation/vaac/index.html |title=London VAAC |publisher=Metoffice.gov.uk |date=19 November 2008 |accessdate=15 May 2010 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070108144933/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/aviation/vaac/index.html |archivedate=8 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provides forecasts to the aviation industry of [[volcanic ash]] clouds that could enter aircraft flight paths and impact aviation safety. The London VAAC, one of nine worldwide, is responsible for the area covering the [[British Isles]], the north east Atlantic and [[Iceland]]. The VAAC were set up by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO), an agency of the United Nations, as part of the International Airways Volcano Watch (IAVW).&lt;ref name=IAVW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/anb/iavwopsg/ |title=International Airways Volcano Watch |publisher=Icao.int |date=26 March 2010 |accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The London VAAC makes use of satellite images, plus seismic, radar and visual observation data from [[Volcanism of Iceland|Iceland]],&lt;ref name=Witham&gt;[http://sacs.aeronomie.be/workshop/talks1/Witham_VAAC_Oct2006.ppt Overview of VAAC Activities presentation]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the location of all of the active volcanoes in its area of responsibility.  The [[NAME (dispersion model)|NAME dispersion model]] developed by the Met Office is used to forecast the movement of the ash clouds 6, 12 and 18 hours from the time of the alert at different flight levels.

=== Air quality ===
{{Main article|UK Dispersion Modelling Bureau}}
The Met Office issues [[Air Quality Index#United Kingdom|air quality]] forecasts made using [[NAME (dispersion model)|NAME]], the Met Office's medium-to-long-range [[atmospheric dispersion modelling|atmospheric dispersion model]]. It was developed as a nuclear accident model following the [[Chernobyl accident]] in 1986, but has since evolved into an all-purpose dispersion model capable of predicting the transport, transformation and deposition of a wide class of airborne materials. NAME is used operationally by the Met Office as an emergency response model as well as for routine air quality forecasting. Aerosol dispersion is calculated using the [[UKCA]] model.

The forecast is produced for pollutants and their typical health effects are shown in the following table.

|-
|Particulates&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;||Fine particles can be carried deep into the lungs where they can cause&lt;br /&gt; inflammation and a worsening of heart and lung diseases
|}

===IPCC===
{{main article|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}}
Until 2001 the Met Office hosted the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] working group, chaired by [[John T. Houghton|John Houghton]], on climate science.  In 2001 the working group moved to the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]].&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;[[Fred Pearce|Pearce, Fred]], ''The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming'', (2010) [[Guardian Books]], {{ISBN|978-0-85265-229-9}}, p. XVI.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High performance computing ===
Due to the large amount of computation needed for [[Numerical Weather Prediction]] and the [[Unified model]], the Met Office has had some of the most powerful supercomputers in the world. In November 1997 the Met Office supercomputer was ranked third in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.top500.org/site/49064|title=United Kingdom Meteorological Office {{!}} TOP500 Supercomputing Sites|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Top500.org|access-date=|author=Mark Twain, Kevin McCurley|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weather stations ==
Reports (observations) from [[weather station]]s can be [[Automatic weather station|automatic]] (totally machine produced), semi-automatic (part-machine and part manual), or manual. Some stations produce manual observations during business hours and revert to automatic observations outside these times. Many stations feature "present weather" sensors, [[closed-circuit television|CCTV]], etc.  There is also a network of 'upper air' stations, using [[Radiosondes]].

Some stations have limited reporting times, while other report continuously, mainly [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] stations where a manned met office is provided for military operations. The "standard" is a once-hourly reporting schedule, but automatic stations can often be "polled" as required, while stations at airfields report twice-hourly, with additional (often frequent in times of bad weather) special reports as necessary to inform airfield authorities of changes to the weather that may affect aviation operations.

Some stations report only [[CLIMAT]] data (e.g. maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall totals over a period, etc.) and these are usually recorded at 0900 and 2100 hours daily. Weather reports are often performed by observers not specifically employed by the Met Office, such as [[Air traffic control]] staff, coastguards, university staff and so on.

The '''Land Surface Model (LSM)''' is a unidimensional computational model developed by ''Gordon Bonan'' that describes ecological processes joined in many [[ecosystem model]]s, hydrological processes found in hydrological models and flow of surface common in surface models using atmospheric models.

In this way, the model examines interactions especially biogeophysics (sensible and latent heat, momentum, albedo, emission of long waves) and biogeochemistry (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of the land-atmosphere the effect of surface of the land in the climate and composition of the atmosphere.

This model has a simplified treatment of the surface flows that reproduce at the very least computational cost the essential characteristics of the important interactions of the land-atmosphere for climatic simulations.

As the types of surface vegetated for some species are several, have a standardization of types of covering being enclosed surfaces covered with water as lakes (amongst others); thus the model wheel for each point of independent form, with the same average of the atmospheric interactions. The model functions in a space grating that can vary of a point until global.

'''Partial impact theory''' is an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] theory describing the partial collision of two [[star]]s and the temporary creation of a bright third [[star]] as a consequence. The theory was explained in [[Alexander William Bickerton]]'s book ''The Romance of the Heavens'' published in 1901.

In ''The Romance of the Heavens'' [[Alexander William Bickerton|Bickerton]] states that a slight ''"grazing"'' collision between stars would be much more common than a head on impact between stars. So he believed this phenomenon needed to be explained to account for the appearance of bright new stars that would appear in the night sky and disappear within a year or even days.

The theory explains that when the two [[Star|stellar]] bodies graze each other, the grazed parts will shear off from the main body of each star. Their velocity will cancel each other's out transforming this energy into heat. While the main mass of each star will continue moving as they did before the collision. The third body created from the two sheared parts of the stars will form between the two original stars.

The temporary star expands after the impact displaying an intense increase in light, after all molecular reactions have taken place the light is replaced by a hollow shell of gas or possibly a [[planetary nebula]], and eventually dissipates into [[space]]. [[Alexander William Bickerton|Bickerton]] explains this bright temporary star by saying that it doesn't disappear due to cooling, but that it was too hot to hold together.

The temperature of the third star, isn't dependent on the amount of contact between the two original stars, but rather the chemical makeup of the stars and their velocities going into the collision. The stability of the third body depends on the size of the contact of the original stars, if the contact was small then the mass of the newly created third body will find it harder to attract [[molecules]] to it. Rather than if it had a larger mass where molecules would find it more difficult to escape from its larger gravitational pull.&lt;ref&gt;Bickerton, A.W, (1901).''The Romance of the Heavens''. London. Swan Sonnencchein &amp; Co., Lim.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pollination network''' is a bipartite [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] network in which plants and [[pollinator]]s are the [[Node (graph theory)|nodes]], and the [[pollination]] interactions form the links between these nodes.&lt;ref&gt;Fonkalsrud, Sindre
[https://bora.uib.no/bitstream/handle/1956/8538/121809649.pdf?sequence=1 Interaction Patterns and Specialization in a Local and National  Norwegian Pollination Network]. [[University of Bergen]]. Spring 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The pollination network is  bipartite as interactions only exist between two distinct, non-overlapping sets of [[species]], but not within the set: a pollinator can never be pollinated, unlike in a  [[Lotka–Volterra equation|predator-prey network]] where a predator can be depredated.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, M. (2009). ''Networks: an introduction'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  A pollination network is two-modal, i.e., it includes only links connecting plant and animal communities.&lt;ref&gt;Olesen,Jens M. ; Bascompte, Jordi; Dupont, Yoko L. ;  Jordano, Pedro [http://www.pnas.org/content/104/50/19891.full.pdf The modularity of pollination networks]. [[PNAS]],  December 11, 2007  vol. 104 n° 50  19891–19896.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nested structure of pollination networks==
A key feature of pollination networks is their nested design. A study of 52 mutualist networks (including plant-pollinator interactions and plant-seed disperser interactions) found that most of the networks were nested.&lt;ref name="Bascompte 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bascompte|first1=Jordi|last2=Jordano|first2=Pedro|last3=Melián|first3=Carlos J.|last4=Olesen|first4=Jens M.|title=The nested assembly of plant–animal mutualistic networks|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=5 August 2003|volume=100|issue=16|pages=9383–9387|doi=10.1073/pnas.1633576100|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/100/16/9383.short|language=en|issn=0027-8424|pmid=12881488|pmc=170927}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the core of the network is made up of highly connected [[Generalist and specialist species|generalists]] (a pollinator that visits many different species of plant), while specialized species interact with a subset of the species that the generalists interact with (a pollinator that visits few species of plant, which are also visited by generalist pollinators).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nielsen|first1=Anders|last2=Bascompte|first2=Jordi|title=Ecological networks, nestedness and sampling effort|journal=Journal of Ecology|date=1 September 2007|volume=95|issue=5|pages=1134–1141|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01271.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01271.x/full|language=en|issn=1365-2745}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the number of interactions in a network increases, the degree of nestedness increases as well.&lt;ref name = "Bascompte 2003"/&gt; One property that results from nested structure of pollination networks is an asymmetry in specialization, where specialist species are often interacting with some of the most generalized species. This is in contrast to the idea of reciprocal specialization, where specialist pollinators interact with specialist plants.&lt;ref name = "Vazquez 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vázquez|first1=Diego P.|last2=Aizen|first2=Marcelo A.|title=Asymmetric Specialization: A Pervasive Feature of Plant–Pollinator Interactions|journal=Ecology|date=1 May 2004|volume=85|issue=5|pages=1251–1257|doi=10.1890/03-3112|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/03-3112/abstract|language=en|issn=1939-9170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the relationship between network complexity and network nestedness, the amount of asymmetry in specialization increases as the number of interactions increases.&lt;ref name = "Vazquez 2004"/&gt;

==Modularity of networks==
Another feature that is common in pollination networks is [[modularity]]. Modularity occurs when certain groups of species within a network are much more highly connected to each other than they are with the rest of the network, with weak interactions connecting different modules.&lt;ref name = "Oleson 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olesen|first1=Jens M.|last2=Bascompte|first2=Jordi|last3=Dupont|first3=Yoko L.|last4=Jordano|first4=Pedro|title=The modularity of pollination networks|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=11 December 2007|volume=104|issue=50|pages=19891–19896|doi=10.1073/pnas.0706375104|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/50/19891.short|language=en|issn=0027-8424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dupont 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dupont|first1=Yoko L.|last2=Olesen|first2=Jens M.|title=Ecological modules and roles of species in heathland plant–insect flower visitor networks|journal=Journal of Animal Ecology|date=1 March 2009|volume=78|issue=2|pages=346–353|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01501.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01501.x/full|language=en|issn=1365-2656}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Within modules it has been shown that individual species play certain roles. Highly specialized species often only interact with individuals within their own module and are known as ‘peripheral species’; more generalized species can be thought of as ‘hubs’ within their own module, with interactions between many different species; there are also species which are very generalized which can act as ‘connectors’ between their own module and other modules.&lt;ref name = "Oleson 2007"/&gt; A study of three separate networks, all of which showed modularity, revealed that hub species were always plants and not the insect pollinators.&lt;ref name = "Dupont 2009"/&gt; Previous work has found that networks will become nested at a smaller size (number of species) than that where networks frequently become modular.&lt;ref name = "Oleson 2007"/&gt;

==Species loss and robustness to collapse==
There is substantial interest into the robustness of pollination networks to species loss and collapse, especially due to anthropogenic factors such as [[habitat destruction]]. The structure of a network is thought to affect how long it is able to persist after species decline begins. In particular, the nested structure of networks has been shown to protect against complete destruction of the network, because the core group of generalists are the most robust to [[extinction]] by habitat loss.&lt;ref name = "Fortuna 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fortuna|first1=Miguel A.|last2=Bascompte|first2=Jordi|title=Habitat loss and the structure of plant–animal mutualistic networks|journal=Ecology Letters|date=1 March 2006|volume=9|issue=3|pages=281–286|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00868.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00868.x/full|language=en|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Memmott 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Memmott|first1=Jane|last2=Waser|first2=Nickolas M.|last3=Price|first3=Mary V.|title=Tolerance of pollination networks to species extinctions|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date=22 December 2004|volume=271|issue=1557|pages=2605–2611|doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2909|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/271/1557/2605.short|language=en|issn=0962-8452|pmc=1691904}}&lt;/ref&gt; Models specifically focused on the effects of habitat loss have shown that specialist species tend to go extinct first, while the last species to go extinct are the most generalized of the network.&lt;ref name ="Fortuna 2006"/&gt; Other studies focusing specifically on the removal of different types of species showed that species decline is the fastest when removing the most generalized species. However, there have been contrasting results on how rapidly decline occurs with removal of these species. One study showed that even at the fastest rate, the decline was still linear.&lt;ref name ="Memmott 2004"/&gt; Another study revealed that with the removal of the most common pollinator species, the network showed a drastic collapse.&lt;ref name = "Kaiser 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaiser-Bunbury|first1=Christopher N.|last2=Muff|first2=Stefanie|last3=Memmott|first3=Jane|last4=Müller|first4=Christine B.|last5=Caflisch|first5=Amedeo|title=The robustness of pollination networks to the loss of species and interactions: a quantitative approach incorporating pollinator behaviour|journal=Ecology Letters|date=1 April 2010|volume=13|issue=4|pages=442–452|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01437.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01437.x/full|language=en|issn=1461-0248}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to focusing on the removal of species themselves, other work has emphasized the importance of studying the loss of interactions, as this will often precede species loss and may well accelerate the rate at which extinction occurs.&lt;ref name = "Valiente 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valiente-Banuet|first1=Alfonso|last2=Aizen|first2=Marcelo A.|last3=Alcántara|first3=Julio M.|last4=Arroyo|first4=Juan|last5=Cocucci|first5=Andrea|last6=Galetti|first6=Mauro|last7=García|first7=María B.|last8=García|first8=Daniel|last9=Gómez|first9=José M.|last10=Jordano|first10=Pedro|last11=Medel|first11=Rodrigo|last12=Navarro|first12=Luis|last13=Obeso|first13=José R.|last14=Oviedo|first14=Ramona|last15=Ramírez|first15=Nelson|last16=Rey|first16=Pedro J.|last17=Traveset|first17=Anna|last18=Verdú|first18=Miguel|last19=Zamora|first19=Regino|title=Beyond species loss: the extinction of ecological interactions in a changing world|journal=Functional Ecology|date=1 March 2015|volume=29|issue=3|pages=299–307|doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12356|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12356/epdf|language=en|issn=1365-2435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Postmodernism}}

'''Post-Marxism''' (not to be confused with [[Post-modern philosophy|post-modern]] [[Marxism]]) is a trend in [[political philosophy]] and [[social theory]], which deconstructs [[Karl Marx]]'s writings and [[Marxists|Marxism]] proper, bypassing [[orthodox Marxism]]. The term 'post-Marxism' first appeared in [[Ernesto Laclau]] and [[Chantal Mouffe]]'s theoretical work, ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy]]''. It can be said that Post-Marxism, as a political theory, was developed at the [[University of Essex]], UK by Laclau and Mouffe. Philosophically, post-Marxism counters derivationism and [[essentialism]] (for example, it does not see economy as a foundation of politics and the State as an instrument that "functions" unambiguously and autonomously on behalf of the interests of a given class).&lt;ref&gt;Iain Mclean &amp; Alistair Mcmillan, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'' (Article: State), Oxford University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent overviews of post-Marxism are provided by [[Ernesto Screpanti]],&lt;ref&gt;"The Postmodern Crisis in Economics and the Revolution against Modernism", “Rethinking Marxism”, 2000 &lt;/ref&gt; [[Göran Therborn]],&lt;ref&gt;From Marxism to Post-Marxism. London: Verso, 2008, 208pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gregory Meyerson.&lt;ref&gt;Meyerson, G. (2009). ''Post-Marxism as Compromise Formation.'' Retrieved from: http://clogic.eserver.org/2009/Meyerson.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}

Post-Marxism dates from the late 1960s; several trends and events of that period influenced its development. The weakness of the  [[Communist]] [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] paradigm became evident and Marxism faced a 'lack' since the [[Second International]]. This happened concurrently with the occurrence internationally of the [[French May|student riots of 1968]], the rise of [[Maoism | Maoist theory]], and the proliferation of commercial [[television]], which covered in its broadcasts the [[Vietnam War]]. Subsequently, Laclau and Mouffe address the proliferation of 'new subject positions' by locating their analysis on a Post-Marxist non-essentialist framework. 

===Semiology and discourse===
When [[Roland Barthes]] began his sustained [[critique]] of [[mass culture]] via semiology—the science of signs—and the book ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', some Marxist philosophers based their social criticism upon linguistics, semiotics, and discourse. Basing his approach on Barthes' work, [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillard]] wrote ''For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign'' (1972), criticizing contemporary [[Marxism]] for ignoring the [[sign value]] of its philosophic discourse.

'''Menpehtyre Ramesses I''' (or '''Ramses''') was the founding [[pharaoh]] of [[ancient Egypt]]'s [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasty]]. The dates for his short reign are not completely known but the time-line of late [[1290s BC|1292–1290 BC]] is frequently cited&lt;ref name="beckerath"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/932193922|title=Chronologie des pharaonischen Ägypten : die Zeitbestimmung der ägyptischen Geschichte von der Vorzeit bis 332 v.

[https://books.google.be/books?id=nfiFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA165 165].&lt;/ref&gt; While Ramesses I was the founder of the 19th dynasty, in reality his brief reign marked the transition between the reign of [[Horemheb]] who had stabilized Egypt in the late 18th dynasty and the rule of the powerful pharaohs of this dynasty, in particular his son [[Seti I]] and grandson [[Ramesses II]], who would bring Egypt up to new heights of imperial power.

==Origins==

[[File:Ramses I.jpg|thumb|left|Pharaoh Ramses I making an offering before Osiris, [[Allard Pierson Museum]].]]
Originally called Pa-ra-mes-su, Ramesses I was of non-royal birth, being born into a noble military family from the [[Nile delta]] region, perhaps near the former [[Hyksos]] capital of [[Avaris]]. He was a son of a troop commander called [[Seti (commander)|Seti]]. His uncle Khaemwaset, an army officer, married Tamwadjesy, the matron of the Harem of [[Amun]], who was a relative of Huy, the viceroy of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], an important state post.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cruz-Uribe|first=Eugene|date=1978|title=The Father of Ramses I: OI 11456|jstor=544684|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|volume=37|issue=3|pages=237–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows the high status of Ramesses' family. Ramesses I found favor with [[Horemheb]], the last pharaoh of the tumultuous [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth dynasty]], who appointed the former as his [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|Vizier]]. Ramesses also served as the [[Priest|High Priest]] of [[Set (deity)|Set]]&lt;ref&gt;P. Montert, ''Everyday Life in Egypt in the Days of Ramesses The Great'', 1974, p. [https://books.google.be/books?id=-Hk58E8jVPkC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197 197].&lt;/ref&gt;  &amp;ndash; as such, he would have played an important role in the restoration of the old religion following the [[Amarna]] [[heresy]] of a generation earlier, under [[Akhenaten]].

Horemheb himself had been a nobleman from outside the immediate royal family, who rose through the ranks of the Egyptian army to serve as the royal advisor to Tutankhamun and Ay and, ultimately, Pharaoh. Since Horemheb was childless, he ultimately chose Ramesses to be his heir in the final years of his reign presumably because Ramesses I was both an able administrator and had a son (Seti I) and a grandson (the future [[Ramesses II]]) to succeed him and thus avoid any succession difficulties.

Upon his accession, Ramesses assumed a ''prenomen'', or royal name. When transliterated, the name is ''mn-pḥty-rʿ'', which is usually interpreted as Menpehtyre, meaning "Established by the strength of [[Ra]]". However, he is better known by his ''nomen'', or personal name. This is transliterated as ''rʿ-ms-sw'', and is usually realised as Ramessu or Ramesses, meaning 'Ra bore him'. Already an old man when he was crowned, Ramesses appointed his son, the later pharaoh [[Seti I]], to serve as the Crown Prince and chosen successor. Seti was charged with undertaking several military operations during this time&amp;ndash;in particular, an attempt to recoup some of Egypt's lost possessions in [[Syria]]. Ramesses appears to have taken charge of domestic matters: most memorably, he completed the second [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]] at [[Karnak|Karnak Temple]], begun under Horemheb.

[[File:Ramses I Mummy.jpg|thumb|Mummy of Ramesses I]]
Ramesses I enjoyed a very brief reign, as evidenced by the general paucity of contemporary monuments mentioning him: the king had little time to build any major buildings in his reign and was hurriedly buried in a small and hastily finished tomb.&lt;ref name="tyldesley"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/932221233|title=Ramesses: Egypt's greatest pharaoh|last=Tyldesley|first=Joyce|year=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=9780140280975|oclc=932221233|pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian priest [[Manetho]] assigns him a reign of 16 months, but this pharaoh certainly ruled Egypt for a minimum of 17 months based on his highest known date which is a Year 2 II Peret day 20 (Louvre C57) stela which ordered the provision of new endowments of food and priests for the [[Egyptian temple|temple]] of [[Ptah]] within the Egyptian fortress of Buhen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/247341737|title=The monuments of Seti I: epigraphic, historical and art historical analysis|last=Brand|first=Peter J|date=2000|publisher=Brill|isbn=9004117709|location=Leiden; Boston; Köln|language=English|pages=289, 300 and 311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jürgen von Beckerath observes that Ramesses I died just 5 months later—in June 1290 BC—since his son Seti I succeeded to power on III Shemu day 24.&lt;ref name="beckerath" /&gt; Ramesses I's only known action was to order the provision of endowments for the aforementioned Nubian temple at Buhen and "the construction of a chapel and a temple (which was to be finished by his son) at Abydos."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/872585819|title=A history of ancient Egypt|last=Grimal|first=Nicolas-Christophe|date=1992|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0631174729|location=Oxford, UK; Cambridge, Massachusetts|language=English|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aged Ramesses was buried in the Valley of the Kings. His tomb, discovered by [[Giovanni Belzoni]] in 1817 and designated [[KV16]], is small in size and gives the impression of having been completed with haste. [[Joyce Tyldesley]] states that Ramesses I's tomb consisted of a single corridor and one unfinished room whose
{{blockquote|walls, after a hurried coat of plaster, were painted to show the king with his gods, with Osiris allowed a prominent position. The red granite sarcophagus too was painted rather than carved with inscriptions which, due to their hasty preparation, included a number of unfortunate errors."&lt;ref name="tyldesley" /&gt;}}

[[Seti I]], his son and successor, later built a small chapel with fine reliefs in memory of his deceased father Ramesses I at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]]. In 1911, [[John Pierpont Morgan]] donated several exquisite reliefs from this chapel to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ranke|first=Hermann|date=1939|title=Review of The Temple of Ramesses I at Abydos|jstor=594071|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=59|issue=2|pages=272–274|doi=10.2307/594071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery and repatriation==
[[File:Fragment of a stela showing Amun enthroned. Mut, wearing the double crown, stands behind him. Both are being offered by Ramesses I, now lost. From Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|Fragment of a stela showing Amun enthroned. Mut, wearing the double crown, stands behind him.

A mummy currently believed to be that of Ramesses I was stolen from Egypt and displayed in a private Canadian museum for many years before being repatriated.  The mummy's identity cannot be conclusively determined, but is most likely to be that of Ramesses I based on CT scans, X-rays, skull measurements and radio-carbon dating tests by researchers at Emory University, as well as aesthetic interpretations of family resemblance. Moreover, the mummy's arms were found crossed high across his chest which was a position reserved solely for Egyptian royalty until 600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/04/0430_030430_royalmummy.html|title=U.S. Museum to Return Ramses I Mummy to Egypt|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|date=April 30, 2003| access-date=2008-04-13|quote=A 3,000-year-old mummy that many scholars believe is ancient Egypt's King Ramses I is the star attraction of an exhibit at the Michael C. Carlos Museum in [[Atlanta]] that will run from April 26 to September 14.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mummy had been stolen by the Abu-Rassul family of grave robbers and brought to North America around 1860 by Dr. [[James Douglas (businessman)|James Douglas]]. It was then placed in the [[The Niagara Falls Museum|Niagara Museum and Daredevil Hall of Fame]] in Niagara Falls [[Ontario]], Canada. The mummy remained there, its identity unknown, next to other curiosities and so-called freaks of nature for more than 130 years. When the owner of the museum decided to sell his property, Canadian businessman William Jamieson purchased the contents of the museum and, with the help of Canadian Egyptologist Gayle Gibson, identified their great value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/2015/04/20/canadas-favourite-mummy-hunter-returns|title=Canada's favourite mummy hunter returns|website=Niagara Falls Review|language=en-CA|access-date=2017-05-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171204121542/http://www.niagarafallsreview.ca/2015/04/20/canadas-favourite-mummy-hunter-returns|archivedate=2017-12-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Jamieson sold the Egyptian artifacts in the collection, including the various mummies, to the [[Michael C. Carlos Museum]] at [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] for US $2 million. The mummy was returned to Egypt on October 24, 2003 with full official honors and is on display at the Luxor Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3215747.stm|title=Egypt's 'Ramses' mummy returned|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=October 26, 2003|accessdate=2008-04-13|quote=An ancient Egyptian mummy thought to be that of Pharaoh Ramses I has returned home after more than 140 years in North American museums.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The 1956 motion picture ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'', directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]], depicts Rameses I (portrayed by [[Ian Keith]]) as the pharaoh who orders the elimination of the first-born of every [[Hebrew]] slave family in Egypt, leading to the scenario of future prophet [[Moses]] being sheltered by [[Bithiah]], who in the film is said to be the daughter of Rameses I and sister of [[Seti I]].

In the 2000 animated musical film ''[[Joseph: King of Dreams]]'', by [[DreamWorks Animation]], Ramesses I is depicted as the pharaoh who has his dreams interpreted by [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]] and who appoints Joseph to the office of Vizier when his foresight and administrative skills prevent Egypt from being ruined by famine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4300">The '''Ramsey–Lewis method''' is a method for defining terms found in [[theory|theoretical framework]]s (such as in [[scientific theory|scientific theories]]), credited to [[Frank P. Ramsey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ramsey|1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using this method, a set of theoretical terms appearing in a [[theory]] can be defined implicitly by the assertions of the theory itself.

==Overview==
A [[scientific theory]] which attempts to describe "[[electron]]s" is inherently abstract, as no one has ever observed an electron directly. Thus, the origin and content of the concept of "electron" is questionable. What does the word exactly signify? Ramsey and Lewis proposed that the meaning of the term "electron" is implicitly generated by the scientific theory that describes it, via all its assertions about electrons. Electrons are those things about which all the statements of the theory are true.

However, some of those statements in a theory refer to other unobserved entities and properties such as "charge" or "spin". For instance, "Electrons attract [[proton]]s" and "Electrons have negative charge" employ the terms "protons" and "negative charge" (with the latter also implicitly using the concept of "charge"). These properties are formalized, statements (such as [[Causality|conditionals]]) are formed using them, and those statements taken together are the [[definition]] of the term.

Consider a sentence such as "There's an electron in the sink." This means something along the lines of: "There exist some properties ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ( one for every theoretical property involved in the scientific theory, with 'electronhood' (which roughly corresponds to the [[essence]] of an [[electron]] included as ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) such that... (a statement in the scientific theory, but with ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; substituted for the specific terms such as 'charge', 'is an electron', etc. employed by the theory), and there is something in the sink that has ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;."

The process of converting the narrative form of a scientific theory into [[second-order logic]] is commonly called "Ramsification" (sometimes also spelled "Ramseyfication").

Example: Suppose there are only three principles in our scientific theory about electrons (those principles can be seen to be statements involving the properties):

A1. Electrons (things that have P1) have charge (P2).

A2. Things with charge (P2) tickle you.

A3. Electrons (things that have P1) cause lightning.

Furthermore, we include the property of "electronhood", as outlined above, to be designated by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the property of "charge" to be designated by ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Then the meaning of a sentence such as "I have an electron in my pocket" is Ramsified into:

"There are properties ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; such that (things with ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; also have ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and things with ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tickle you, and things with ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; cause lightning, and there is a thing with ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in my pocket)."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4853">'''Relative growth rate''' ('''RGR''') is growth rate relative to size. It is also called the [[exponential growth]] rate, or the continuous growth rate. In terms of [[differential equations]], if &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the current size, and &lt;math&gt;\frac{dW}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; its growth rate, then relative growth rate is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{W}\frac{dW}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;. If the relative growth rate is constant, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{W}\frac{dW}{dt} = k&lt;/math&gt;, it is not difficult to verify that a solution to this equation is &lt;math&gt;W(t) = \exp(kt)&lt;/math&gt;.

Briggs|author2=Lyle Cochran|author3=Bernard Gillett|title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Single_Variable_Calculus.html?id=_cMLQgAACAAJ|accessdate=24 September 2012|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Education, Limited|page= 441|isbn=978-0-321-57056-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if an initial population of &lt;math&gt;P_0&lt;/math&gt; bacteria doubles every twenty minutes, then at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; it is given by the equation &lt;math&gt;P(t) = P_0 2^t = P_0 \exp(\ln(2)t)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the number of twenty-minute intervals that have passed. However, we usually prefer to measure time in hours or minutes, and it is not difficult to change the units of time.  For example, since 1 hour is 3 twenty-minute intervals, the population in one hour is &lt;math&gt;P(3)=P_0 2^3&lt;/math&gt;.  The hourly growth factor is 8, which means that for every 1 at the beginning of the hour, there are 8 by the end.  Indeed, &lt;math&gt;P(T) = P_0 8^T = P_0 \exp(\ln(8)T)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is measured in hours, and the relative growth rate may be expressed as &lt;math&gt;\ln(2)&lt;/math&gt; or approximately 69% per twenty minutes, and as &lt;math&gt;\ln(8)&lt;/math&gt; or approximately 208% per hour.&lt;ref name="BriggsCochran2011"/&gt;

In [[plant physiology]], RGR is a measure used to quantify the speed of plant growth. It is measured as the mass increase per aboveground biomass per day, for example as g g&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; d&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. It is considered to be the most widely used way of estimating plant growth, but has been criticised as calculations typically involve the destructive harvest of plants.&lt;ref name=hoffman&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Hoffmann | first1 = W. A.| last2 = Poorter | first2 = H.| title = Avoiding Bias in Calculations of Relative Growth Rate| journal = Annals of Botany| volume = 90| issue = 1| pages = 37–42| year = 2002| pmid = 12125771| doi = 10.1093/aob/mcf140| pmc = 4233846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem is that RGR nearly always decreases over time as the biomass of a plant increases, but traditionally this has been ignored when modelling plant growth. The RGR decreases for several reasons - non-photosynthetic biomass (roots and stems) increases, the top leaves of a plant begin to shade lower leaves and soil nutrients can become limiting. Overall, respiration scales with total biomass, but photosynthesis only scales with photosynthetic biomass and as a result biomass accumulates more slowly as total biomass increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Paine | first1 = C.

A novel approach to separate size effects from intrinsic growth differences is implemented and described in detail in Philipson ''et al.'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;Christopher D.

RGR is calculated using the following equation:&lt;ref name=hoffman/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;RGR = (\ln W_2 - \ln W_1)/(t_2-t_1)&lt;/math&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt;\ln&lt;/math&gt; = [[natural logarithm]]

&lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; = time one (e.g. in days)

&lt;math&gt;t_2&lt;/math&gt; = time two (e.g. in days)

&lt;math&gt;W_1&lt;/math&gt; = Size at time one

&lt;math&gt;W_2&lt;/math&gt; = Size at time two

A '''sacrificial part''' is a part of a machine or product that is intentionally engineered to fail under excess [[mechanical stress]], [[Electric current|electrical stress]], or other unexpected and dangerous situations. The sacrificial part is engineered to fail first, and thus protect other parts of the system.

Examples of sacrificial parts include:
* [[Fuse (electrical)|Electrical fuses]]
* [[Burst disk|Over-pressure burst disks]]
* [[Shear pin|Mechanical shear pins]]
* [[Galvanic anode]]s

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5495">In [[electrical engineering]], a '''shmoo plot''' is a graphical display of the response of a component or system varying over a range of conditions or inputs.  

== Origin ==

The origin of the shmoo plot is unclear. It is referenced in a 1966 [[IEEE]] paper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5217603/ The Sensitivity Function in Variability Analysis], Charles Belove, [[IEEE]] Transactions on Reliability, Volume R-15, Issue 2, August 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Another early reference is in manuals for [[IBM 2365 Processor Storage]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/roger.broughton/museum/corestore/ram64k.htm 64KByte gate in a Core Storage Unit], Virtual Museum, [[Newcastle University]]. According to the [https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/roger.broughton/museum/index.htm Virtual Museum] page, this computer was installed in 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of the shmoo plot is sometimes credited to VLSI Hall Of Fame inductee [[Robert Huston]] (1941-2006).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.chiphistory.org/TCI%20All_Stars-Hall_of_Fame%20161212.pdf VLSIresearch’s CHIP MAKING INDUSTRY HALL OF FAME], VLSI Research Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; But this is unlikely because Huston did not begin working as a test engineer until 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/mercurynews/obituary.aspx?n=robert-e-huston&amp;pid=18711143 Robert Huston Obituary], [[San Jose Mercury News]], July 31 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Lifeshmoo.jpg|thumb|right|100 px]]

The plot takes its name from the [[Shmoo]], a fictional species created by [[Al Capp]] in the cartoon [[Li'l Abner]]. These small, blob-like creatures have shapes similar to the "working" volumes that would be enclosed by shmoo plots drawn against three independent variables (such as voltage, temperature, and response speed). 

Semiconductor chips do not usually exhibit "shmoo" shape plots.{{fact|date=June 2017}} Historically, testing of magnetic core memory arrays produced the "shmoo" shape and the term continued into the semiconductor era.

== Description==

Shmoo plots are often used to represent the results of the testing of complex electronic systems such as computers or integrated circuits such as [[DRAM]]s, ASICs or microprocessors. The plot usually shows the range of conditions in which the [[device under test]] operates (in adherence with some remaining set of specifications).  

For example, when testing [[semiconductor]] [[memory]]: [[voltage]]s, [[temperature]], and [[refresh rate]]s can be varied over specified ranges and only certain combinations of these factors will allow the device to operate. Plotted on independent axes (voltage, temperature, refresh rates), the range of working values will enclose a three-dimensional, usually oddly-shaped volume. Other examples of conditions and inputs that can be varied include [[frequency]], [[temperature]], timing parameters, system- or component-specific variables, and even varying knobs tweakable during [[silicon chip fabrication]] producing parts of varying quality which are then used in the process.

Often one 'knob' or variable is plotted on one axis against another knob or variable on another axis, producing a two-dimensional graph. This allows the test engineer to visually observe the operating ranges of the device under test.  This process of varying the conditions and inputs to the component or system may sometimes be referred to as 'shmooing' but more officially known as electrical testing or qualification. [[Automatic test equipment]] often contains software features that allow automated shmooing of a part.

== Examples ==
Automated test equipment have traditionally generated a two-dimensional, [[ASCII]] form of the shmoo plot that uses an "X" to represent functional points and blank space for non-functional points.

[[File:64K DRAM Shmoo Plot-typical.png|thumb|left|Normal shmoo plot]]
[[File:64K DRAM Shmoo Plot-abnormal.png|thumb|right|Abnormal shmoo plot]]{{clear}}
If sufficiently-wide ranges of the two independent variables were to be tested, a normal shmoo plot would show an operating envelope of some shape not unlike Al Capp's [[Shmoo]], but in practice, this might damage the [[device under test]], and finer-grained views are of much more interest, particularly focusing on published component margins (e.g., - 5% Vcc). When this is done, the operating envelope typically extends to the border of the plot in one or more directions.

Sometimes a shmoo plot has an unusual and surprising shape, and while it is difficult to determine the exact cause, it is sometimes due to some unusual defect (perhaps in only part of a circuit) coupled with otherwise normal operation. In other cases, it might be an artifact of the electrical testing setup or the test program used, in particular a [[race condition]]. As such, a shmoo plot can be a useful test setup verification tool.

A limitation of the technique is that the extended duration of testing of the device may cause additional internal device heating, resulting in a skewing of the data (later tested cells on the plot may perform worse than earlier ones). One way of avoiding this is to exercise the device thoroughly in a similar manner immediately before the actual shmoo test.

'''Shoals Marine Laboratory''' ('''SML''') is a seasonal marine field station located on [[Appledore Island]], [[Maine]], in the United States. Appledore Island is the largest of the [[Isles of Shoals]] archipelago, a group of rocky islands just offshore of the coastline of Maine and [[New Hampshire]]. The laboratory is cooperatively operated and maintained by [[Cornell University]] and the [[University of New Hampshire]]. Shoals is a residential facility where participants and staff live together in a close-knit learning community. SML's academic program runs from May through August to accommodate off-campus study for undergraduates. Limited access for research can be arranged during the off-season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.sml.cornell.edu/sml_research.html
 | title = Research - Shoals Marine Lab
 | accessdate = 2010-01-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to Appledore Island is provided by Shoals Marine Laboratory vessels operated by laboratory personnel. SML administrative offices are at Cornell University in [[Ithaca, New York]], in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]], and at the University of New Hampshire in [[Durham, New Hampshire]].

==Academics==
[[File:Shoals Marine Lab Underwater Research Class.jpg|thumb|Students aboard the R/V ''John B. Heiser'' as part of SML's Underwater Research diving course]]
SML is dedicated to undergraduate education and research in [[marine science]], and has been offering courses since 1966. The laboratory offers a wide variety of summer credit courses for undergraduates and high school students along with programs and workshops for graduate students, teachers, professionals, and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.sml.cornell.edu/sml_students_creditcourses.html

 | url = http://www.sml.cornell.edu/sml_publiceducation.html
 | title = Public Education - Welcome
 | accessdate = 2010-01-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Shoals programs provide participants with the opportunity to become immersed in the world of marine science under the tutelage of an academic teaching staff from Cornell, UNH, and other leading academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.sml.cornell.edu/sml_students_meetthefaculty.html
 | title = Meet the Faculty - Shoals Marine Laboratory
 | accessdate = 2010-01-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An academic day at Shoals consists of laboratory and classroom time, combined with extensive fieldwork. Fieldwork typically includes excursions along Appledore's rocky [[intertidal zone]] and seabird nesting colonies, visits to neighboring islands to study harbor seals, terns, and archaeological sites, off-shore cruises, and trips to the Maine/New Hampshire coast to study mud flats, salt marshes, and bogs. Lessons on [[sustainable living]] are incorporated into the experience. Credit course offerings range from survey courses like Field Marine Science to more specialized courses like Field Ornithology, Underwater Research, and Ecology of Animal Behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.sml.cornell.edu/sml_students_creditcourses.html
 | title = Students - Credit Courses
 | accessdate = 2010-01-17
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other programs, workshops, and citizen science opportunities include [[Biological illustration|Biological Illustration]], a course about Forensic Science, and Island Archaeology.

==Research==
[[File:Seals Sunbathing.jpg|left|thumb|Seals sunbathing at the Isles of Shoals]]
The Shoals Marine Laboratory emphasizes its dedication to undergraduate research by offering several Research Internships in Field Science (RIFS). This program is the successor to the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program which was funded by a seven-year [[National Science Foundation]] grant. The RIFS program allows undergraduates to perform a full research project - from proposal to research paper and presentation - in the course of a summer. It also provides participants with full room and board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.sml.cornell.edu/sml_internresearch.html
 | title = Research Internships in Field Science
 | accessdate = 2014-10-30
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the formal research internship, nearly all credit courses at SML require small individual research projects. For example, students enrolled in the Underwater Research course must produce an original research proposal, supported by preliminary data collected and analyzed in the course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.sml.cornell.edu/sml_cc_ur.html
 | title = Underwater Research
 | accessdate = 2014-10-30
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lab also hosts and works with visiting researchers from across the country, including a migratory bird banding program, the [[New Hampshire Fish and Game]] tern restoration project on [[Isles of Shoals|White Island]], gull research, and monitoring of subtidal communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
[[File:Volunteer Weekend at Shoals Marine Lab.jpg|thumb|Volunteers disembarking from the R/V ''John M. Kingsbury'']]
Appledore Island, originally named Hog Island, was visited by [[Scandinavia]]ns sailing from [[Greenland]] before the 17th century. Europeans arrived in 1614 to take advantage of the favorable fishing conditions in the [[Gulf of Maine]]. The island saw an exodus in 1680 and sustained a small population until 1847. Thomas Laighton and daughter [[Celia Thaxter]] helped to revitalize the island through Celia's hospitality, artistry, and garden. The garden has been restored as a tourist attraction today which helps generate revenue for SML. Celia's death in 1894, subdivision of land in 1908, and a major fire at the Appledore Hotel in September 1914 led to the decline of this era in Appledore history. UNH's Marine Zoological Laboratory on Appledore thrived from 1928 to 1940. This was followed by government control of the island during World War II and a period of vandalism into the 1970s.

The current form of the lab was conceived by John M. Kingsbury and John M. Anderson, both professors at Cornell. Having visited the [[Star Island (New Hampshire)|Star Island]] conference center, they were keen to bring undergraduate university students out to the Isles of Shoals as an alternative to the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]. The first group of students arrived on Star Island in 1966. Appledore Island, which was mostly uninhabited since World War II, was selected and developed from the late 1960s to early 1970s as the future home of the lab. UNH took interest in the project due to their proximity and previous association with the island. Dominic Gratta of [[Kittery, Maine]], directed his crew, assisted by students and early SML staff, in the refurbishing of old hotel and military era buildings as well as the construction of six new buildings and utility services.

==Island utilities and sustainability==
[[File:Shoals Diesel Usage.svg|thumb|left|SML diesel usage charted over time]]
Shoals must provide the utilities necessary to support the island population during its operating season independent of mainland services. Since 1974, SML has generated its own electricity, produced its own drinking water, and treated its own wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kingsbury |first=John |date=1991 |title=Here's how we'll do it : an informal history of the construction of the Shoals Marine Laboratory, Appledore Island, Maine |location=Ithaca, New York |publisher=Bullbrier Press |isbn=978-0961261030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent initiatives in engineered island systems and the educational and operating benefits to living more [[sustainably]] on Appledore have guided the development of [[renewable energy]] resources and low impact wastewater management.

===Wind, sun, and diesel power===
[[File:Shoals Battery Bank.jpeg|thumb|Sealed absorbed glass mat batteries for photovoltaic power collection]]
SML maintains three [[diesel generator]]s and two green energy grids to provide electrical power day and night. Green energy grids collect power from the sun with [[photovoltaic panels]] and from the wind with a 7.5&amp;nbsp;kW Bergy [[wind turbine]]. Power collected is stored in sealed absorbed glass mat batteries. There are 52 batteries creating a storage capacity of 388 A·h at a nominal 48 V DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stored power is inverted to AC electricity for distribution to the island's 14 buildings. Diesel generators provide backup power. Over the past seven years, addition of photovoltaic power generation with battery storage, along with sustainability and energy efficiency efforts, has:
* Reduced electrical grid load by 50%.
* Reduced diesel generator run times by 50%.
* Reduced fuel needs by 75%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Solar Hot Water Panels.JPG|thumb|Solar hot water panels on the roof of the SML water conservation building|left]]

===Propane and solar-based hot water===
In 2011, SML installed a solar water heating system to provide a significant portion of its {{convert|500|gal|l|abbr=on}} per day domestic hot water needs. The solar water heating system collects heat energy from the sun and transfers the energy to domestic hot water systems used in its commercial kitchen and residential shower facilities. In 2012, SML's sustainable engineering interns calculated that the system reduced [[propane]] consumption for heating water by 42%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wastewater===
Sewage is treated with three [[Septic drain field|subsurface leach fields]] and several [[Clivus Multrum]] composting toilet installations. Eljen In-Drain technology was used in order to decrease the size of the leach fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composting toilet installations have two major advantages for SML:
* The Nepon foam flush toilets use only three ounces of fresh water per flush.
* Solids composted by the units do not have to be hauled away using a septic truck and barge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drinking water===
Water is obtained from a {{convert|20|ft|adj=on|0}} well on the north side of the island. This supply can serve the island throughout the season if there is sufficient rainfall during the summer. A [[reverse osmosis]] system provides fresh water if well water does not meet demand. Shoals is licensed by the State of Maine to provide potable drinking water to island residents and visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://oaspub.epa.gov/enviro/sdw_report_v3.first_table?pws_id=ME0010973&amp;state=ME&amp;source=Surface%20water&amp;population=100&amp;sys_num=1
 | title = EPA Envirofacts
 | accessdate = 2014-12-11
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation measures reduce the volume of freshwater used to 1/5 of expected consumption.

===Communications===
Shoals currently uses a 5.8&amp;nbsp;GHz wireless link which provides an internet connection from a [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]] base station to the [[World War II]]-era radio tower on the island. Internet access is distributed to the buildings via a fiber, ethernet, and wireless network. Island staff carry [[VHF]] radios for inter-island communication and cell phones work well for mainland phone calls. [[Vonage]] is used for more formal office phone and fax needs. VHF channel 80A is monitored for boat to island communication.

==Research vessels==
[[File:Research Vessel JB Heiser Underway.jpg|thumb|Shoals Marine Lab's R/V ''John B. Heiser'' underway]]
The lab is served by two [[US Coast Guard]] inspected research vessels: the {{convert|47|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}}, 34.49 gross ton ''R/V John M. Kingsbury'' and the {{convert|35.7|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}}, 13 gross ton ''R/V John B. Heiser''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.sml.cornell.edu/sml_welcomekingsbury.html
 | title = Welcome - R/V John M. Kingsbury
 | accessdate = 2010-01-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both boats are used to transport goods and people to the island and for research/education. The ''R/V John M. Kingsbury'' has a [[winch]] and a one-ton [[crane (machine)|crane]] for the deployment of research equipment and for the movement of heavy materials from the mainland to the island.

The lab also operates various smaller vessels, including the {{convert|27|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} ''R/V Acipenser'', {{convert|21|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} ''R/V Storm Petrel'', numerous inflatables, a {{convert|16|ft|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[Boston Whaler]] (''R/V Miss Christine''), and two small sailboats.

The '''Society for Industrial Archeology (SIA)''' is a [[North America]]n [[nonprofit organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nonprofit Report for Society for Industrial Archeology | publisher = GuideStar | url = http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/23-7166954/society-industrial-archeology.aspx | accessdate = 2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated to studying and preserving historic industrial sites, structures and equipment. It was founded in 1971 in [[Washington, D.C.]], and its members are primarily from the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], although there is some crossover with similar [[industrial archaeology]] organizations in the [[United Kingdom]]. SIA's headquarters is currently located in the Department of Social Sciences at [[Michigan Technological University]] in [[Houghton, Michigan]]. In addition to the national organization, there are thirteen regional chapters throughout the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = About the Society for Industrial Archeology (SIA) | publisher = Society for Industrial Archeology | url = http://www.sia-web.org/about/ | accessdate = 2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Since its founding in October 1971, SIA members have gathered at an annual conference, which also serves as the annual business meeting required by its bylaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hyde | first = Charles K. | title = The Birth of the SIA and Reminiscences by Some of its Founders | journal = [[IA, The Journal of the Society for Industrial Archeology]] | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–16 | year = 1991 | jstor = 40968216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual conference is typically held each spring. The Fall Tour, a second annual gathering usually held in September or October, began in 1972. Both annual events feature visits to local industrial sites, both active and historical.  The conference additionally includes a day of paper sessions.  Industrial heritage study tours to other countries began in 1990 and occur on an irregular schedule.

SIA produces two official publications, the formal, [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] ''[[IA, The Journal of the Society for Industrial Archeology]]'' twice a year and the less formal quarterly ''Society for Industrial Archeology Newsletter (SIAN).''  The annual conference is typically accompanied by a custom guidebook profiling local industrial and cultural sites.  In addition, SIA produces occasional publications on special topics.

==Newsletter==
The ''Society for Industrial Archeology Newsletter (SIAN)'' ([[ISSN]] {{ISSN search link|0160-1067}}) is the Society's official [[newsletter]], published quarterly. ''SIAN'' publishes articles about recent events, summaries of the Society's annual conferences and fall tours, news about local chapters, brief abstracts of articles on industrial archeology-related subjects, and other notes and queries.

The first issue of ''SIAN'' was published in January 1972 and reported on the Society's founding. Volumes 1 through 9 consisted of six issues per calendar year, not including two special supplemental issues published in 1972. The current quarterly publication schedule with Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall issues began with Volume 10 in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SIA Newsletter |publisher=Society for Industrial Archeology |url=http://www.sia-web.org/publications/sia-newsletter/ |accessdate=2015-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Auklet flock Shumagins 1986.jpg|thumb|350px|right|A flock of [[auklet]]s exhibit swarm behaviour]]

'''Swarm behaviour''', or '''swarming''', is a [[Collective animal behaviour|collective behaviour]] exhibited by entities, particularly animals, of similar size which aggregate together, perhaps milling about the same spot or perhaps moving ''en masse'' or [[Animal migration|migrating]] in some direction. It is a highly interdisciplinary topic.&lt;ref name=Bouffanais&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bouffanais|first1=Roland|title=Design and Control of Swarm Dynamics|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-981-287-750-5|edition=First|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789812877505}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a term, ''swarming'' is applied particularly to insects, but can also be applied to any other entity or animal that exhibits swarm behaviour. The term ''[[flocking (behavior)|flocking]]'' or ''murmuration'' can refer specifically to swarm behaviour in birds, ''[[herd behaviour|herding]]'' to refer to swarm behaviour in [[tetrapods]], and [[shoaling and schooling|''shoaling'' or ''schooling'']] to refer to swarm behaviour in fish. [[Phytoplankton]] also gather in huge swarms called [[Algal bloom|''blooms'']], although these organisms are [[algae]] and are not self-propelled the way animals are. By extension, the term “swarm” is applied also to inanimate entities which exhibit parallel behaviours, as in a [[Swarm robotics|robot swarm]], an [[earthquake swarm]], or a swarm of stars.

From a more abstract point of view, swarm behaviour is the collective motion of a large number of [[Self-propelled particles|self-propelled entities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1 = O'Loan|author2 = Evans|doi = 10.1088/0305-4470/32/8/002|title = Alternating steady state in one-dimensional flocking|year = 1998|journal = Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General|volume = 32|issue = 8|pages = L99–L105|arxiv = cond-mat/9811336|bibcode = 1999JPhA...32L..99O }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of the mathematical modeller, it is an [[emergence|emergent]] behaviour arising from simple rules that are followed by individuals and does not involve any central coordination. Swarm behaviour is also studied by [[active matter]] physicists as a phenomenon which is not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], and as such requires the development of tools beyond those available from the [[statistical physics]] of systems in thermodynamic equilibrium.

Swarm behaviour was first simulated on a computer in 1986 with the simulation program [[boids]].&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Reynolds CW | year = 1987 | title = Flocks, herds and schools: A distributed behavioral model | citeseerx = 10.1.1.103.7187 | journal = Computer Graphics | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 25–34 | doi = 10.1145/37401.37406 | isbn = 0-89791-227-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This program simulates simple [[Agent-based model in biology|agents]] (boids) that are allowed to move according to a set of basic rules. The model was originally designed to mimic the flocking behaviour of birds, but it can be applied also to schooling fish and other swarming entities.

==Models==

{{See also|Collective animal behaviour}}

In recent decades, scientists have turned to modeling swarm behaviour to gain a deeper understanding of the behaviour.

===Mathematical models===
[[File:Metric vs topological distance in schools of fish.png|right|thumb|400px|In the [[metric distance]] model of a [[fish school]] (left), the focal fish (yellow) pays attention to all fish within the small zone of repulsion (red), the zone of alignment (lighter red) and the larger zone of attraction (lightest red). In the [[Topological space|topological distance]] model (right), the focal fish only pays attention to the six or seven closest fish (green), regardless of their distance.]]

|image3=[http://www.aridolan.com/ofiles/Efloys.aspx Efloys simulation]}}
Early studies of swarm behaviour employed mathematical models to simulate and understand the behaviour. The simplest mathematical models of animal swarms generally represent individual animals as following three rules:
* Move in the same direction as their neighbours
* Remain close to their neighbours
* Avoid collisions with their neighbours

The [[boids]] computer program, created by [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]] in 1986, simulates swarm behaviour following the above rules.&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt; Many subsequent and current models use variations on these rules, often implementing them by means of concentric "zones" around each animal. In the "zone of repulsion", very close to the animal, the focal animal will seek to distance itself from its neighbours to avoid collision. Slightly further away, in the "zone of alignment", the focal animal will seek to align its direction of motion with its neighbours. In the outermost "zone of attraction", which extends as far away from the focal animal as it is able to sense, the focal animal will seek to move towards a neighbour.

The shape of these zones will necessarily be affected by the sensory capabilities of a given animal. For example, the visual field of a bird does not extend behind its body. Fish rely on both vision and on [[hydrodynamic]] perceptions relayed through their [[lateral line]]s, while Antarctic [[krill]] rely both on vision and hydrodynamic signals relayed through [[antenna (biology)|antennae]].

However recent studies of starling flocks have shown that each bird modifies its position, relative to the six or seven animals directly surrounding it, no matter how close or how far away those animals are.&lt;ref name="Ballerini et al"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0711437105 |vauthors=Ballerini M, Cabibbo N, Candelier R, Cavagna A, Cisbani E, Giardina I, Lecomte V, Orlandi A, Parisi G, Procaccini A, Viale M, Zdravkovic V |title= Interaction ruling animal collective behavior depends on topological rather than metric distance: Evidence from a field study |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=1232–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18227508 |pmc=2234121|arxiv = 0709.1916 |bibcode = 2008PNAS..105.1232B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactions between flocking starlings are thus based on a [[topological]], rather than a metric, rule. It remains to be seen whether this applies to other animals. Another recent study, based on an analysis of high-speed camera footage of flocks above Rome and assuming minimal behavioural rules, has convincingly simulated a number of aspects of flock behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hildenbrandt H, Carere C, Hemelrijk CK | year = 2010 | title = Self-organized aerial displays of thousands of starlings: a model | url = http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/6/1349.full | journal = Behavioral Ecology | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 1349–1359 | doi = 10.1093/beheco/arq149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hemelrijk CK, Hildenbrandt H | year = 2011 | title = Some causes of the variable shape of flocks of birds | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0022479 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 8| page = e22479 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0022479 | pmid=21829627 | pmc=3150374| bibcode=2011PLoSO...622479H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rug.nl/sciencelinx/exhibits/swarming/index|title=Zwermen en scholen - Swarming - Permanente expo - Bezoek onze expo's &amp; workshops! - Science LinX - Rijksuniversiteit Groningen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rug.nl/fmns-research/beso/_people/hemelrijk|title=Onderzoek aan de Faculteit Wiskunde en Natuurwetenschappen - Faculteit Wiskunde en Natuurwetenschappen - Over ons - Rijksuniversiteit Groningen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary models===
In order to gain insight into why animals evolve swarming behaviours, scientists have turned to evolutionary models that simulate populations of evolving animals. Typically these studies use a [[genetic algorithm]] to simulate [[evolution]] over many generations.

===Emergence===
{{Main|Emergence}}

The concept of emergence—that the properties and functions found at a hierarchical level are not present and are irrelevant at the lower levels–is often a basic principle behind [[Self-organization|self-organizing systems]].&lt;ref name="importance-ppt"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.authorstream.com/Presentation/wdorsey-88049-hierarchy-life-biology-education-ppt-powerpoint/ |accessdate=6 October 2009 |title=Hierarchy of Life |date=14 September 2008 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of [[Biological organisation|self-organization in biology]] leading to emergence in the natural world occurs in ant colonies. The queen does not give direct orders and does not tell the ants what to do.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Instead, each ant reacts to stimuli in the form of chemical scents from larvae, other ants, intruders, food and buildup of waste, and leaves behind a chemical trail, which, in turn, provides a stimulus to other ants. Here each ant is an autonomous unit that reacts depending only on its local environment and the genetically encoded rules for its variety. Despite the lack of centralized decision making, ant colonies exhibit complex behaviours and have even been able to demonstrate the ability to solve geometric problems. For example, colonies routinely find the maximum distance from all colony entrances to dispose of dead bodies.

===Stigmergy===
{{Main|Stigmergy}}

A further key concept in the field of swarm intelligence is [[stigmergy]].&lt;ref name="Parunak2003"&gt;Parunak, H. v D. (2003). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.116.1990&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf  "Making swarming happen"] In: Proceedings of Conference on Swarming and Network Enabled Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR), McLean, Virginia, USA, 3 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marsh2007&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marsh L. |author2=Onof C. | year = 2008 | title = Stigmergic epistemology, stigmergic cognition | url = http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/10004/1/3z2fx4r7prqwob3vfdq.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Cognitive Systems Research | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 136–149 | doi = 10.1016/j.cogsys.2007.06.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stigmergy is a mechanism of indirect coordination between agents or actions. The principle is that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way, subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently systematic activity. Stigmergy is a form of self-organization. It produces complex, seemingly intelligent structures, without need for any planning, control, or even direct communication between the agents. As such it supports efficient collaboration between extremely simple agents, who lack any memory, intelligence or even awareness of each other.&lt;ref name=Marsh2007 /&gt;

===Swarm intelligence===
{{Main|Swarm intelligence}}

[[Swarm intelligence]] is the [[collective behaviour]] of [[decentralization|decentralized]], [[Self-organization|self-organized]] systems, natural or artificial. The concept is employed in work on [[artificial intelligence]]. The expression was introduced by [[Gerardo Beni]] and Jing Wang in 1989, in the context of [[Cellular automaton|cellular robotic]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Beni, G., Wang, J. Swarm Intelligence in Cellular Robotic Systems, Proceed. NATO Advanced Workshop on Robots and Biological Systems, Tuscany, Italy, June 26–30 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarm intelligence systems are typically made up of a population of simple [[Agent-based model in biology|agents]] such as [[boids]] interacting locally with one another and with their environment. The agents follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between such agents lead to the [[emergence]] of intelligent global behaviour, unknown to the individual agents.

Swarm intelligence research is multidisciplinary. It can be divided into natural swarm research studying biological systems and artificial swarm research studying human artefacts. There is also a scientific stream attempting to model the swarm systems themselves and understand their underlying mechanisms, and an engineering stream focused on applying the insights developed by the scientific stream to solve practical problems in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dorigo | first1 = M | last2 = Birattari | first2 = M | year = 2007 | title = Swarm intelligence | url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Swarm_intelligence | journal = Scholarpedia | volume = 2 | issue = 9| page = 1462 | doi = 10.4249/scholarpedia.1462 | bibcode = 2007SchpJ...2.1462D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Algorithms===
Swarm algorithms follow a Lagrangian approach or an [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Eulerian]] approach.&lt;ref name="Li et al"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li YX, Lukeman R, Edelstein-Keshet L | display-authors = etal | year = 2007 | title = Minimal mechanisms for school formation in self-propelled particles | url = http://www.math.ubc.ca/~keshet/Papers/YXL_Lukeman_LEK.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena | volume = 237 | issue = 5| pages = 699–720 | doi = 10.1016/j.physd.2007.10.009 |bibcode = 2008PhyD..237..699L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eulerian approach views the swarm as a [[Field (physics)|field]], working with the density of the swarm and deriving mean field properties. It is a hydrodynamic approach, and can be useful for modelling the overall dynamics of large swarms.&lt;ref&gt;Toner J and Tu Y (1995) "Long-range order in a two-dimensional xy model: how birds fly together" ''Physical Revue Letters,'' '''75 (23)(1995), 4326–4329.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Topaz C, Bertozzi A | year = 2004 | title = Swarming patterns in a two-dimensional kinematic model for biological groups | url = | journal = SIAM J Appl Math | volume = 65 | issue = 1| pages = 152–174 | doi = 10.1137/S0036139903437424 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.88.3071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Topaz C, Bertozzi A, Lewis M | year = 2006 | title = A nonlocal continuum model for biological aggregation | url = | journal = Bull Math Bio | volume = 68 | issue = 7| pages = 1601–1623 | doi = 10.1007/s11538-006-9088-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most models work with the Lagrangian approach, which is an [[agent-based model]] following the individual agents (points or particles) that make up the swarm.

Simulations demonstrate that a suitable "nearest neighbour rule" eventually results in all the particles swarming together, or moving in the same direction. This emerges, even though there is no centralized coordination, and even though the neighbours for each particle constantly change over time.&lt;ref name="Vicsek1995" /&gt; SPP models predict that swarming animals share certain properties at the group level, regardless of the type of animals in the swarm.&lt;ref name="Buhl et al"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buhl J, ((Sumpter DJT)), Couzin D, Hale JJ, Despland E, Miller ER, Simpson SJ | display-authors = etal | year = 2006 | title = From disorder to order in marching locusts | url = http://webscript.princeton.edu/~icouzin/website/wp-content/plugins/bib2html/data/papers/buhl06.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5778| pages = 1402–1406 | doi = 10.1126/science.1125142 | pmid = 16741126 |bibcode = 2006Sci...312.1402B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Swarming systems give rise to [[emergent behaviour]]s which occur at many different scales, some of which are both universal and robust.

[[Particle swarm optimization]] is another algorithm widely used to solve problems related to swarms. It was developed in 1995 by [[James Kennedy (social psychologist)|Kennedy]] and [[Russell C.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The system initially seeds a population with random solutions. It then searches in the [[Candidate solution|problem space]] through successive generations using [[stochastic optimization]] to find the best solutions. The solutions it finds are called [[Point particle|particles]]. Each particle stores its position as well as the best solution it has achieved so far. The particle swarm optimizer tracks the [[Maxima and minima|best local value]] obtained so far by any particle in the local neighbourhood. The remaining particles then move through the problem space following the lead of the optimum particles. At each time iteration, the particle swarm optimiser accelerates each particle toward its optimum locations according to simple [[mathematical formulae|mathematical rules]]. Particle swarm optimization has been applied in many areas. It has few parameters to adjust, and a version that works well for a specific applications can also work well with minor modifications across a range of related applications.&lt;ref&gt;Hu X [http://www.swarmintelligence.org/tutorials.php Particle swarm optimization: Tutorial].

===Insects===
[[File:Mueckenschwarm 50p 1600kbit.ogv|thumb|right|Swarm of [[nematocera]], flying around a treetop]]

The behaviour of insects that live in [[Colony (biology)|colonies]], such as ants, bees, wasps and termites, has always been a source of fascination for children, naturalists and artists. Individual insects seem to do their own thing without any central control, yet the colony as a whole behaves in a highly coordinated manner.&lt;ref name=SwarmSmarts&gt;Bonabeau E and Theraulaz G (2008) "Swarm Smarts". In ''Your Future with Robots'' Scientific American Special Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have found that cooperation at the colony level is largely [[Self-organization|self-organized]]. The group coordination that emerges is often just a consequence of the way individuals in the colony interact. These interactions can be remarkably simple, such as one ant merely following the trail left by another ant. Yet put together, the cumulative effect of such behaviours can solve highly complex problems, such as locating the shortest route in a network of possible paths to a food source. The organised behaviour that emerges in this way is sometimes called [[swarm intelligence]].&lt;ref name=SwarmSmarts /&gt;

====Ants====
[[File:Ants eating fruit.jpg|thumb|right|A swarm of [[ant]]s which have discovered a food source]]
{{See also|Ant colony|Ant colony optimization|Ant mill|Ant robotics|Artificial ants}}

Individual ants do not exhibit complex behaviours, yet a colony of ants collectively achieves complex tasks such as constructing nests, taking care of their young, building bridges and foraging for food. A colony of ants can collectively select (i.e. send most workers towards) the best, or closest, food source from several in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Czaczkes|first1=T.J.|last2=Grüter|first2=C.|last3=Ratnieks|first3=F. L. W.|title=Trail pheromones: an integrative view of their role in colony organisation|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|date=2015|volume=60|pages=581–599|doi=10.1146/annurev-ento-010814-020627|pmid=25386724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such collective decisions are achieved using positive feedback mechanisms. Selection of the best food source is achieved by ants following two simple rules. First, ants which find food return to the nest depositing a [[pheromone]] chemical. More pheromone is laid for higher quality food sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beckers|first1=R.|last2=Deneubourg|first2=J. L.|last3=Goss|first3=S|title=Modulation of trail laying in the ant Lasius niger (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and its role in the collective selection of a food source|journal=Journal of Insect Behavior|date=1993|volume=6|issue=6|pages=751–759|doi=10.1007/BF01201674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if two equidistant food sources of different qualities are found simultaneously, the pheromone trail to the better one will be stronger. Ants in the nest follow another simple rule, to favor stronger trails, on average. More ants then follow the stronger trail, so more ants arrive at the high quality food source, and a positive feedback cycle ensures, resulting in a collective decision for the best food source. If there are two paths from the ant nest to a food source, then the colony usually selects the shorter path. This is because the ants that first return to the nest from the food source are more likely to be those that took the shorter path. More ants then retrace the shorter path, reinforcing the pheromone trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goss|first1=S.|last2=Aron|first2=S.|last3=Deneubourg|first3=J. L.|last4=Pasteels|first4=J. M.|title=Self-organized shortcuts in the Argentine ant|journal=Naturwissenschaften|date=1989|volume=76|issue=12|pages=579–581|doi=10.1007/BF00462870|bibcode=1989NW.....76..579G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The successful techniques used by [[ant]] colonies have been studied in computer science and robotics to produce distributed and fault-tolerant systems for solving problems. This area of [[biomimetics]] has led to studies of ant locomotion, search engines that make use of "foraging trails", fault-tolerant storage and networking algorithms.&lt;ref name="SANdisk"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dicke E, Byde A, Cliff D, Layzell P |year=2004 |chapter=An ant-inspired technique for storage area network design |title=Proceedings of Biologically Inspired Approaches to Advanced Information Technology: First International Workshop, BioADIT 2004 LNCS 3141 |pages=364–379 |editor1=A.

====Bees====
[[File:Bee swarm feb08.jpg|thumb|Bees swarming on a shrub]]
{{Main|Bees algorithm|Swarming (honey bee)}}

When a honey bee swarm emerges from a hive they do not fly far at first. They may gather in a tree or on a branch only a few meters from the hive. In this new location, the bees cluster about the queen and send 20 -50 scout bees out to find a suitable new nest locations.The scout bees are the most experienced foragers in the cluster. An individual scout returning to the cluster promotes a location she has found. She uses a dance similar to the [[waggle dance]] to indicate direction and distance to others in the cluster. The more excited she is about her findings the more excitedly she dances. If she can convince other scouts to check out the location she found, they may take off, check out the proposed site and promote the site further upon their return. Several different sites may be promoted by different scouts at first. After several hours and sometimes days, slowly a favourite location emerges from this decision making process. When all scouts agree on a final location the whole cluster takes off and flies to it. Sometimes, if no decision is reached, the swarm will separate, some bees going in one direction; others, going in another. This usually results in failure, with both groups dying. A swarm may fly for a kilometre or more to the scouted out location, though some species may establish new colonies within as little as 500 meters from the natal nest, such as ''[[Apis dorsata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oldroyd|first1=BP|title=Colony relatedness in aggregations of ''Apis dorsata'' Fabricius (Hymenoptera, Apidae)|journal=Insectes Sociaux|date=1998|volume=47|pages=94–95|doi=10.1007/s000400050015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collective decision making process is remarkably successful in identifying the most suitable new nest site and keeping the swarm intact. A good nest site has to be large enough to accommodate the swarm (about 15 litres in volume), has to be well protected from the elements, receive a certain amount of warmth from the sun, be some height above the ground, have a small entrance and resist the infestation of ants - hence why trees are often selected.&lt;ref&gt;Milius, Susan [http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/43117/title/Swarm_Savvy Swarm Savvy], How bees, ants and other animals avoid dumb collective decisions; Science News, May 9th, 2009; Vol.175 #10 (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081003081637.htm Bee Swarms Follow High-speed 'Streaker' Bees To Find A New Nest]; ScienceDaily (Nov. 24, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seeley | first1 = Thomas D. | last2 = Visscher | first2 = P.

====Cockroaches====
Similar to ants, [[cockroach]]es leave chemical trails in their faeces as well as emitting airborne [[pheromones]] for swarming and mating. Other cockroaches will follow these trails to discover sources of food and water, and also discover where other cockroaches are hiding. Thus, cockroaches can exhibit [[Emergence#Emergent properties and processes|emergent behaviour]],&lt;ref name="viegas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animal.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/cockroach.html |title=Cockroaches Make Group Decisions |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |author=Jennifer Viegas |accessdate=10 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704111419/http://animal.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/cockroach.html |archivedate=4 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which group or swarm behaviour emerges from a simple set of individual interactions.

Cockroaches are mainly nocturnal and will run away when exposed to light. A study tested the hypothesis that cockroaches use just two pieces of information to decide where to go under those conditions: how dark it is and how many other cockroaches there are. The study conducted by José Halloy and colleagues at the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles|Free University of Brussels]] and other European institutions created a set of tiny [[robot]]s that appear to the roaches as other roaches and can thus alter the roaches' perception of [[critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]]. The robots were also specially scented so that they would be accepted by the real roaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Locusts====
[[File:Schwarm Wanderheuschrecke.jpg|thumb|upright|A 19th century depiction of a swarm of [[desert locust]]s]]
{{see also|Marching locusts}}

''[[Locusts]]'' are the swarming phase of the short-horned [[grasshopper]]s of the family [[Acrididae]]. Some species can breed rapidly under suitable conditions and subsequently become gregarious and migratory. They form bands as [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] and swarms as adults—both of which can travel great distances, rapidly stripping fields and greatly [[pest (organism)|damaging crops]]. The largest swarms can cover hundreds of square miles and contain billions of locusts. A locust can eat its own weight (about 2&amp;nbsp;grams) in plants every day. That means one million locusts can eat more than one ton of food each day, and the largest swarms can consume over 100,000 [[tonne]]s each day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/bugs/locust.html Locust ''Locustidae''] ''National Geographic''. Retrieved 12 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarming in locusts has been found to be associated with increased levels of [[serotonin]] which causes the locust to change colour, eat much more, become mutually attracted, and breed much more easily. Researchers propose that swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding and studies have shown that increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs or, in some species, simply encountering other individuals causes an increase in levels of serotonin. The transformation of the locust to the swarming variety can be induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7858996.stm|title=Locust swarms 'high' on serotonin|date=29 January 2009|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/jeb.00648 |vauthors=Rogers SM, Matheson T, Despland E, Dodgson T, Burrows M, Simpson SJ |date = November 2003|title=Mechanosensory-induced behavioural gregarization in the desert locust ''Schistocerca gregaria'' |journal=J.

An individual locust's response to a loss of alignment in the group appears to increase the randomness of its motion, until an aligned state is again achieved. This noise-induced alignment appears to be an intrinsic characteristic of collective coherent motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0811195106 |last=Yates |first=CA |last2=Erban |first2=R |last3=Escudero |first3=C |last4=Couzin |first4=ID |last5= Buhl |first5=J |last6=Kevrekidis |first6=IG |last7=Maini |first7=PK |last8=Sumpter |first8=DJ |title=Inherent noise can facilitate coherence in collective swarm motion |journal=Proc.

====Insect migration====
[[File:Monarch flock.jpg|thumb|Cluster of [[Monarch butterfly|monarch butterflies]]. Monarch butterflies migrate to [[Santa Cruz, California]] where they [[overwinter]]]]
{{Main|Insect migration}}
{{see also|Lepidoptera migration}}
[[Insect migration]] is the seasonal movement of [[insect]]s, particularly those by species of [[dragonflies]], [[beetle]]s, [[butterflies]] and [[moth]]s. The distance can vary from species to species, but in most cases these movements involve large numbers of individuals. In some cases the individuals that migrate in one direction may not return and the next generation may instead migrate in the opposite direction. This is a significant difference from [[bird migration]].

[[Monarch butterfly|Monarch butterflies]] are especially noted for their lengthy annual migration. In North America they make massive southward migrations starting in August until the first frost. A northward migration takes place in the spring. The monarch is the only butterfly that migrates both north and south as the birds do on a regular basis. But no single individual makes the entire round trip. Female monarchs deposit eggs for the next generation during these migrations.&lt;ref&gt;Pyle, Robert Michael, "National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Butterflies", p712-713, Alfred A. Knopf, New York, {{ISBN|0-394-51914-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of these journeys exceeds the normal lifespan of most monarchs, which is less than two months for butterflies born in early summer. The last generation of the summer enters into a non-reproductive phase known as [[diapause]] and may live seven months or more.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dbc.uci.edu/~pjbryant/biodiv/lepidopt/danaidae/monarchm.htm |title=Monarch, Danaus plexippus |accessdate=2008-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121215095741/http://www.dbc.uci.edu/~pjbryant/biodiv/lepidopt/danaidae/monarchm.htm |archivedate=2012-12-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During diapause, butterflies fly to one of many overwintering sites. The generation that overwinters generally does not reproduce until it leaves the overwintering site sometime in February and March. It is the second, third and fourth generations that return to their northern locations in the United States and Canada in the spring. How the species manages to return to the same overwintering spots over a gap of several generations is still a subject of research; the flight patterns appear to be inherited, based on a combination of the position of the sun in the sky&lt;ref&gt;Gugliotta, Guy (2003): [http://ipm.osu.edu/trans/053_231.htm Butterflies Guided By Body Clocks, Sun Scientists Shine Light on Monarchs' Pilgrimage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305034410/http://ipm.osu.edu/trans/053_231.htm |date=2006-03-05 }}.

Approximately 1800 of the world's 10,000 bird species are long-distance migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sekercioglu, C.H.|year=2007|title=Conservation ecology: area trumps mobility in fragment bird extinctions|journal=Current Biology |volume=17|pages=R283–R286|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.02.019|pmid=17437705|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary motivation for migration appears to be food; for example, some hummingbirds choose not to migrate if fed through the winter. Also, the longer days of the northern summer provide extended time for [[breeding in the wild|breeding]] birds to feed their young. This helps [[Diurnality|diurnal]] birds to produce larger [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]]es than related non-migratory species that remain in the tropics. As the days shorten in autumn, the birds return to warmer regions where the available food supply varies little with the season. These advantages offset the high stress, physical exertion costs, and other risks of the migration such as predation.

Many birds migrate in flocks. For larger birds, it is assumed that flying in flocks reduces energy costs. The V formation is often supposed to boost the efficiency and range of flying birds, particularly over long [[Bird migration|migratory]] routes. All the birds except the first fly in the [[upwash]] from one of the [[wingtip vortices]] of the bird ahead. The upwash assists each bird in supporting its own weight in flight, in the same way a [[Glider aircraft|glider]] can climb or maintain height indefinitely in rising air. Geese flying in a [[V formation]] save energy by flying in the updraft of the wingtip vortex generated by the previous animal in the formation. Thus, the birds flying behind do not need to work as hard to achieve lift. Studies show that birds in a V formation place themselves roughly at the optimum distance predicted by simple aerodynamic theory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20090521201002/http://stinet.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA401264 Drag Reduction from Formation Flight.

Other animals may use similar drafting techniques when migrating. [[Lobster]]s, for example, migrate in close single-file formation "lobster trains", sometimes for hundreds of miles.

The Mediterranean and other seas present a major obstacle to soaring birds, which must cross at the narrowest points. Massive numbers of large [[Bird of prey|raptor]]s and storks pass through areas such as [[Gibraltar]], [[Falsterbo]], and the [[Bosphorus]] at migration times. More common species, such as the [[European honey buzzard]], can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can also cause funnelling, particularly of large diurnal migrants. This is a notable factor in the [[Central America]]n migratory bottleneck. This concentration of birds during migration can put species at risk. Some spectacular migrants have already gone extinct, the most notable being the [[passenger pigeon]]. During migration the flocks were a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) wide and 300 miles (500&amp;nbsp;km) long, taking several days to pass and containing up to a billion birds.

}}

The term "shoal" can be used to describe any group of fish, including mixed-species groups, while "school" is used for more closely knit groups of the same species swimming in a highly synchronised and polarised manner.

Fish derive many benefits from shoaling behaviour including defence against predators (through better predator detection and by diluting the chance of capture), enhanced [[foraging]] success, and higher success in finding a mate.&lt;ref name="Pitcher 1993"&gt;Pitcher TJ and Parish JK (1993) [https://books.google.com/books?id=10lElCT7v5wC&amp;pg=PA363&amp;dq=%22Behaviour+of+teleost+fishes%22+%22%22Functions+of+shoaling+behaviour+in+teleosts%22%22&amp;num=50&amp;ei=JzYKSpyWM42GkQSM992bBA "Functions of shoaling behaviour in teleosts"] In: Pitcher TJ (ed) ''Behaviour of teleost fishes''. Chapman and Hall, New York, pp 363–440&lt;/ref&gt; It is also likely that fish benefit from shoal membership through increased [[hydrodynamic]] efficiency.&lt;ref name="Hoare et al. 2000"&gt;Hoare DJ, Krause J, Peuhkuri N and Godin JGJ (2000) [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119004845/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 ''Body size and shoaling in fish''] Journal of Fish Biology, 57(6) 1351-1366.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish use many traits to choose shoalmates. Generally they prefer larger shoals, shoalmates of their own species, shoalmates similar in size and appearance to themselves, healthy fish, and kin (when recognised). The "oddity effect" posits that any shoal member that stands out in appearance will be preferentially targeted by predators. This may explain why fish prefer to shoal with individuals that resemble them. The oddity effect would thus tend to homogenise shoals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Snekser JL, Ruhl N, Bauer K, McRobert SP | year = 2010 | title = The Influence of Sex and Phenotype on Shoaling Decisions in Zebrafish | url = http://comparativepsychology.org/2010ijcpissue1/05.Snekser_etal_Final.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 23 | issue =  | pages = 70–81 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725190329/http://comparativepsychology.org/2010ijcpissue1/05.Snekser_etal_Final.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One puzzling aspect of shoal selection is how a fish can choose to join a shoal of animals similar to themselves, given that it cannot know its own appearance. Experiments with [[zebrafish]] have shown that shoal preference is a learned ability, not innate. A zebrafish tends to associate with shoals that resemble shoals in which it was reared, a form of [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Engeszer RE, Ryan MJ, Parichy DM | year = 2004 | title = Learned Social Preference in Zebrafish | url = http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/ryan/Publications/2004/2004CurrBiol14%20881.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Current Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 10| pages = 881–884 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2004.04.042 | pmid = 15186744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other open questions of shoaling behaviour include identifying which individuals are responsible for the direction of shoal movement. In the case of [[fish migration|migratory]] movement, most members of a shoal seem to know where they are going. In the case of foraging behaviour, captive shoals of [[golden shiner]] (a kind of [[minnow]]) are led by a small number of experienced individuals who knew when and where food was available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1314 |author=Reebs, S.G. |title=Can a minority of informed leaders determine the foraging movements of a fish shoal? |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=403–9 |year=2000 |pmid=10675263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radakov estimated herring schools in the North Atlantic can occupy up to 4.8 cubic kilometres with fish densities between 0.5 and 1.0 fish/cubic metre. That's several billion fish in one school.&lt;ref&gt;Radakov DV (1973) ''Schooling in the ecology of fish.'' Israel Program for Scientific Translation, translated by Mill H.

Between May and July huge numbers of [[sardine]]s spawn in the cool waters of the [[Agulhas Bank]] and then follow a current of cold water northward along the east coast of South Africa. This great migration, called the [[sardine run]], creates spectacular feeding frenzies along the coastline as marine predators, such as dolphins, sharks and gannets attack the schools.

====Krill====

Later work suggested that swimming activity in krill varied with stomach fullness. Satiated animals that had been feeding at the surface swim less actively and therefor sink below the mixed layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Current Biology |year=2006 |volume=16 |pmid=16461267 |issue=3 |pages=83–4 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2006.01.044 |title=Satiation gives krill that sinking feeling |author1=Geraint A. Tarling  |author2=Magnus L. Johnson |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As they sink they produce faeces which may mean that they have an important role to play in the Antarctic carbon cycle. Krill with empty stomachs were found to swim more actively and thus head towards the surface. This implies that vertical migration may be a bi- or tri-daily occurrence. Some species form surface swarms during the day for feeding and reproductive purposes even though such behaviour is dangerous because it makes them extremely vulnerable to predators.&lt;ref name="howard"&gt;Howard, D.: "[http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/c1198/chapters/133-140_Krill.pdf Krill]", pp.&amp;nbsp;133–140 in Karl, H.A. et al.

====Copepods====
[[File:Copepodkils.jpg|thumb|right|This copepod has its antenna spread (click to enlarge). The antenna detects the pressure wave of an approaching fish.]]
{{See also|Hunting copepods}}

[[Copepod]]s are a group of tiny [[crustacean]]s found in the sea and lakes. Many species are [[plankton]]ic (drifting in sea waters), and others are [[benthos|benthic]] (living on the ocean floor). Copepods are typically {{convert|1|to|2|mm|in|2}} long, with a teardrop shaped body and large [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Although like other crustaceans they have an armoured [[exoskeleton]], they are so small that in most species this thin armour, and the entire body, is almost totally transparent. Copepods have a compound, median single eye, usually bright red, in the centre of the transparent head.

Copepods also swarm. For example, monospecific swarms have been observed regularly around [[coral reef]]s and [[sea grass]], and in lakes. Swarms densities were about one million copepods per cubic metre. Typical swarms were one or two metres in diameter, but some exceeded 30 cubic metres. Copepods need visual contact to keep together, and they disperse at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamner | first1 = WM | last2 = Carleton | first2 = JH | year = 1979 | title = Copepod swarms: Attributes and role in coral reef ecosystems | url = http://72.48.224.78/lo/toc/vol_24/issue_1/0001.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Limnol.

Spring produces [[Algal bloom|blooms]] of swarming [[phytoplankton]] which provide food for copepods. Planktonic copepods are usually the dominant members of the [[zooplankton]], and are in turn major food organisms for many other marine animals. In particular, copepods are prey to [[forage fish]] and [[jellyfish]], both of which can assemble in vast, million-strong swarms. Some copepods have extremely fast [[escape response]]s when a predator is sensed and can jump with high speed over a few millimetres (see animated image below).

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Jelly cc4.jpg|Swarms of [[jellyfish]] also prey on copepods
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Planktonic copepods are important to the [[carbon cycle]]. Some scientists say they form the largest animal [[biomass]] on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Johannes Dürbaum |author2=Thorsten Künnemann |lastauthoramp=yes |date=November 5, 1997 |title=Biology of Copepods: An Introduction |url=http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biologyintro.html |publisher=[[Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg]] |accessdate=December 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526164720/http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biologyintro.html |archivedate=May 26, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They compete for this title with [[Antarctic krill]]. Because of their smaller size and relatively faster growth rates, however, and because they are more evenly distributed throughout more of the world's oceans, copepods almost certainly contribute far more to the [[secondary productivity]] of the world's oceans, and to the global ocean [[carbon sink]] than [[krill]], and perhaps more than all other groups of organisms together. The surface layers of the oceans are currently believed to be the world's largest carbon sink, absorbing about 2 billion tons of carbon a year, the equivalent to perhaps a third of [[greenhouse gas|human carbon emissions]], thus reducing their impact. Many planktonic copepods feed near the surface at night, then sink into deeper water during the day to avoid visual predators. Their moulted exoskeletons, faecal pellets and respiration at depth all bring carbon to the deep sea.

====Algal blooms====
Many single-celled organisms called [[phytoplankton]] live in oceans and lakes. When certain conditions are present, such as high nutrient or light levels, these organisms reproduce explosively. The resulting dense swarm of phytoplankton is called an [[algal bloom]]. Blooms can cover hundreds of square kilometres and are easily seen in satellite images. Individual phytoplankton rarely live more than a few days, but blooms can last weeks.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey R and Scott M (2010) [http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Phytoplankton/page1.php What are phytoplankton] [[NASA Earth Observatory]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NOAA_HAB&gt;[http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/res/Centers/HumanHealth/docs/habs.pdf Harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616173236/http://www.glerl.noaa.gov/res/Centers/HumanHealth/docs/habs.pdf |date=2010-06-16 }} 2009, [[NOAA]], Center of Excellence for Great Lakes and Human Health.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plants ===
Scientists have attributed swarm behavior to plants for hundreds of years. In his 1800 book, ''Phytologia: or, The philosophy of agriculture and gardening'', [[Erasmus Darwin]] wrote that plant growth resembled swarms observed elsewhere in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Phytologia.html?id=YggpAAAAYAAJ|title=Phytologia: Or, The Philosophy of Agriculture and Gardening. With the Theory of Draining Morasses and with an Improved Construction of the Drill Plough|last=Darwin|first=Erasmus|date=1800-01-01|publisher=P. Byrne|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While he was referring to more broad observations of plant morphology, and was focused on both root and shoot behavior, recent research has supported this claim.

Roots, in particular, display observable swarm behavior, growing in patterns that exceed the statistical threshold for random probability, and indicate the presence of communication between individual root apexes. The primary function of plant roots is the uptake of soil nutrients, and it is this purpose which drives swarm behavior. Plants growing in close proximity have adapted their growth to assure optimal nutrient availability. This is accomplished by growing in a direction that optimizes the distance between nearby roots, thereby increasing their chance of exploiting untapped nutrient reserves. The action of this behavior takes two forms: maximization of distance from, and repulsion by, neighboring root apexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ciszak|first=Marzena|last2=Comparini|first2=Diego|last3=Mazzolai|first3=Barbara|last4=Baluska|first4=Frantisek|last5=Arecchi|first5=F.

Plant responses are often complex, integrating multiple inputs to inform an autonomous response. Additional inputs that inform swarm growth includes light and gravity, both of which are also monitored in the transition zone of a root's apex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baluška|first=František|last2=Mancuso|first2=Stefano|last3=Volkmann|first3=Dieter|last4=Barlow|first4=Peter W.|date=2010-07-01|title=Root apex transition zone: a signalling–response nexus in the root|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1360138510000889|journal=Trends in Plant Science|volume=15|issue=7|pages=402–408|doi=10.1016/j.tplants.2010.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These forces act to inform any number of growing "main" roots, which exhibit their own independent releases of inhibitory chemicals to establish appropriate spacing, thereby contributing to a swarm behavior pattern. Horizontal growth of roots, whether in response to high mineral content in soil or due to [[stolon]] growth, produces branched growth that establish to also form their own, independent root swarms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961862730|title=Plant behaviour and intelligence|last=J.|first=Trewavas, A.|date=2014|publisher=Oxford university press|isbn=9780199539543|oclc=961862730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarming is also used to describe groupings of some kinds of [[Bacteria#Predators|bacteria]] such as [[myxobacteria]]. Myxobacteria swarm together in "wolf packs", actively moving using a process known as [[bacterial gliding]] and keeping together with the help of intercellular molecular [[Signal transduction|signals]].&lt;ref name="Allison C, Hughes C 1991 403–422"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Reichenbach_2001&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reichenbach H |title=Myxobacteria, producers of novel bioactive substances |journal=J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol |year=2001 |pages=149–56 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pmid=11780785 |doi=10.1038/sj.jim.7000025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cologne, Germany, two biologists from the University of Leeds demonstrated flock like behaviour in humans.

The mathematical modelling of [[flocking behaviour]] is a common technology, and has found uses in animation. Flocking simulations have been used in many films&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gabbai |first=J.M.E. |title=Complexity and the Aerospace Industry: Understanding Emergence by Relating Structure to Performance using Multi-Agent Systems |year=2005 |publisher=University of Manchester Doctoral Thesis |place=Manchester |url=http://www.gabbai.com/academic/complexity-and-the-aerospace-industry-understanding-emergence-by-relating-structure-to-performance-using-multi-agent-systems/}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Crowd simulation|generate crowds]] which move realistically. Tim Burton's ''[[Batman Returns]]'' was the first movie to make use of swarm technology for rendering, realistically depicting the movements of a group of bats using the [[boids]] system. [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]] made use of similar technology, known as [[Massive (software)|massive]], during battle scenes. Swarm technology is particularly attractive because it is cheap, robust, and simple.

An ant-based computer simulation using only six interaction rules has also been used to evaluate aircraft boarding behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore R (2008) [http://computing-reports.open.ac.uk/2008/TR2008-25.pdf "A multi-agent system approach to a simulation study comparing the performance of aircraft boarding using pre-assigned seating and free-for-all strategies"] ''Open University'', Technical report No 2008/25.&lt;/ref&gt; Airlines have also used ant-based routing in assigning aircraft arrivals to airport gates. An airline system developed by [[Douglas A. Lawson]] uses swarm theory, or [[swarm intelligence]]—the idea that a colony of ants works better than one alone. Each pilot acts like an ant searching for the best airport gate. "The pilot learns from his experience what's the best for him, and it turns out that that's the best solution for the airline," Lawson explains. As a result, the "colony" of pilots always go to gates they can arrive and depart quickly. The program can even alert a pilot of plane back-ups before they happen. "We can anticipate that it's going to happen, so we'll have a gate available," says Lawson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2008/0406-planes_trains_and_ant_hills.htm "Planes, Trains and Ant Hills: Computer scientists simulate activity of ants to reduce airline delays"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124132227/https://www.sciencedaily.com/videos/2008/0406-planes_trains_and_ant_hills.htm |date=2010-11-24 }} ''Science Daily'', 1 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herd behaviour]] in [[marketing]] has been used to explain the dependencies of customers' mutual behaviour. ''[[The Economist]]'' reported a recent conference in [[Rome]] on the subject of the simulation of adaptive human behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Swarming the shelves: How shops can exploit people's herd mentality to increase sales? | publisher= The Economist | date= 2006-11-11 | page= 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shared mechanisms to increase impulse buying and get people "to buy more by playing on the herd instinct." The basic idea is that people will buy more of products that are seen to be popular, and several feedback mechanisms to get product popularity information to consumers are mentioned, including [[smart card]] technology and the use of [[RFID|Radio Frequency Identification Tag]] technology. A "swarm-moves" model was introduced by a [[Florida Institute of Technology]] researcher, which is appealing to supermarkets because it can "increase sales without the need to give people discounts."

[[Image:SWARM-vs-guerilla.png|thumb|300px|Contrast between guerrilla ambush and true swarming (Edwards-2003)]]
{{main|Swarming (military)}}

[[Swarming (military)|Military swarming]] is a behaviour where autonomous or partially autonomous units of action attack an enemy from several different directions and then regroup. ''Pulsing'', where the units shift the point of attack, is also a part of military swarming. Military swarming involves the use of a decentralized force against an opponent, in a manner that emphasizes mobility, communication, unit autonomy and coordination or synchronization.&lt;ref name=Edwards-2000&gt;{{cite book
 | title=Swarming on the Battlefield: Past, Present, and Future

 | publisher= Rand Corporation
 | series=Rand Monograph MR-1100
 | url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1100
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically military forces used principles of swarming without really examining them explicitly, but now active research consciously examines military doctrines that draw ideas from swarming.

Merely because multiple units converge on a target, they are not necessarily swarming. Siege operations do not involve swarming, because there is no manoeuvre; there is convergence but on the besieged fortification. Nor do [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla ambushes]] constitute swarms, because they are "hit-and-run". Even though the ambush may have several points of attack on the enemy, the guerillas withdraw when they either have inflicted adequate damage, or when they are endangered.

In 2014 the U. S. [[Office of Naval Research]] released a video showing tests of a swarm of small autonomous drone attack boats that can steer and take coordinated offensive action as a group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/06/tech/innovation/navy-swarm-boats/ U.S. Navy could 'swarm' foes with robot boats], ''CNN'', 13 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths==

* There is a popular myth that [[lemming]]s commit [[mass suicide]] by swarming off cliffs when they migrate. Driven by strong biological urges, some species of lemmings may migrate in large groups when population density becomes too great. Lemmings can swim and may choose to cross a body of water in search of a new habitat. In such cases, many may drown if the body of water is so wide as to stretch their physical capability to the limit. This fact combined with some unexplained fluctuations in the population of Norwegian lemmings gave rise to the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlifenews.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlife_news.view_article&amp;articles_id=56&amp;issue_id=6 |title=Lemming Suicide Myth Disney Film Faked Bogus Behavior |first=Riley |last=Woodford |publisher= |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103112042/http://www.wildlifenews.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlife_news.view_article&amp;articles_id=56&amp;issue_id=6 |archivedate=January 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Piranha]] have a reputation as fearless fish that swarm in ferocious and predatory packs. However, recent research, which started "with the premise that they school as a means of cooperative hunting", discovered that they were in fact rather fearful fish, like other fish, who schooled for protection from their predators, such as cormorants, caimans and dolphins. A researcher described them as "basically like regular fish with large teeth".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/24/science/24obse.html?_r=1 Red-Bellied Piranha Is Really Yellow] ''New York Times'', 24 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Swiss Seismological Service'''  ({{lang-de|Schweizerischer Erdbebendienst}}, {{lang-fr|Service sismologique suisse}}, {{lang-it|Servizio sismico svizzero}}, {{lang-rm|Servizi da terratrembels svizzer}})  at [[ETH Zurich]] is the federal agency responsible for monitoring [[earthquakes]] in Switzerland and its neighboring countries and for assessing Switzerland’s seismic hazard. When an earthquake happens, the SED informs the public, authorities, and the media about the earthquake’s location, magnitude, and possible consequences. The activities of the SED are integrated in the [http://www.bafu.admin.ch/naturgefahren/14806/14961/index.html?lang=de federal action plan for earthquake precaution].

== History ==
The beginnings of the SED trace back to the establishment of the Erdbebenkommission in 1878. In 1914, the earthquake monitoring mandate was defined in a federal law. Thus, what had been a voluntary activity was transformed into an institution. In its present form as a nondepartmental unit of ETH Zurich, the SED has been in existence since 2009.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/about-us/portrait/history/|title=History Swiss Seismological Service |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earthquake monitoring ==
More than 150 seismic monitoring stations installed and serviced by the SED constantly monitor earthquake activity in Switzerland and its neighboring countries. The processing center in Zurich acquires data recorded in Switzerland from two different sources:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/earthquakes/monitoring/|title=Earthquake Monitoring Switzerland |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Swiss National Network (CHNet) consisting of both the Swiss Digital Seismic Network (SDSNet) and the Swiss Strong Motion Network (SSMNet), mainly using broadband seismometers to register weak local, moderate regional and moderate to strong global earthquakes as well as accelerometers to register moderate and strong local earthquakes.
* Special networks (often temporary) in order to monitor increased natural seismic activity, do aftershock deployments, monitor geothermal exploration, support research and educational projects (e.g. AlpArray and seismo@school), or industry projects by third-party assignment.

== Earthquake hazard in Switzerland ==
In comparison with other European countries Switzerland faces a medium seismic hazard, but there are regional differences: In Valais, Basel, the St. Gallen Rhine Valley, Mittelbünden, the Engadine, and Central Switzerland more earthquakes are registered than in other regions. However, earthquakes may occur anytime and anywhere in Switzerland. &lt;br&gt;
A strong earthquake with a magnitude of approximately 6 occurs every 50 to 100 years on average. The last time an earthquake of such magnitude was recorded was in 1946 near Sierre in Valais.&lt;br&gt;
The strongest earthquake in Switzerland so far had a magnitude of approximately 6.6 and destroyed large parts of the city of Basel in 1356. If such an earthquake were to occur in Basel today, several thousand fatalities, tens of thousands of seriously and slightly injured people, and property damage on the order of approximately CHF 140 billion could be expected.&lt;br&gt;
The best protection measures against the effects of an earthquake are an earthquake-resistant building design and securing objects that may topple. 90 percent of the buildings in Switzerland are not built to a seismic code, and it is not clear to what extent they could withstand a strong earthquake. Only few cantons have statutory regulations requiring adherence to construction standards for earthquake-resistant building.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/knowledge/seismic-hazard-switzerland/|title=Earthquake hazard and risk |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/knowledge/earthquake-country-switzerland/historical-earthquakes/basel-1356/|title=Scenario Earthquake Basel |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alert in case of an earthquake ==
Earthquakes can neither be predicted nor prevented. However, the SED records the ground tremors around the clock. Within approximately 90 seconds details about the time, location, magnitude, and possible effects of an earthquake are displayed on the website www.seismo.ethz.ch.&lt;br&gt;
The SED automatically reports any noticeable earthquakes to the authorities and the media. At the same time, this information is transmitted to the SED’s 24-hour on-call service via pager, e-mail, and SMS. This service is also available to the authorities and the media for further information about current earthquakes, and prepares background information that is published on the website.&lt;br&gt;
In case of earthquakes that cause major damage worldwide, the SED additionally informs the Swiss Humanitarian Aid Unit (SHA).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/earthquakes/alerting/|title=Warning |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and teaching ==
Besides earthquake monitoring and the assessment of seismic hazard, the researchers of the SED are involved in numerous national and international research projects, which are largely financed by third parties. This guarantees the permanent exchange of information across national borders. Fields in which the SED researchers are involved include, for example, glacial and engineering seismology, static seismology, induced seismic activity, as well as the monitoring of landslides and seismotectonics. The training of junior researchers also plays an important role for the SED. This is done with lectures and seminars that are integral parts of the teaching program at ETH, as well as through the supervision of master’s and doctoral theses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/research-and-teaching/fields_of_research/|title=Research and Teaching |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nuclear-test-ban treaty monitoring ==
In 1996, the UN countries decided to draft an agreement on the ban of nuclear tests. An international monitoring system was established to control the adherence to this agreement. The SED contributes by supplying the authority in charge in Vienna with data recorded by the seismic station in the Davos region, which was constructed for exactly this purpose. For example, the seismic station already recorded the corresponding ground shaking twelve minutes after the nuclear test in North Korea in 2013.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seismo.ethz.ch/en/earthquakes/monitoring/nuclear-test-ban-treaty-monitoring/|title=Nuclear-test-ban treaty monitoring |work=www.seismo.ethz.ch |access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2078">'''Temporary laws''', '''temporary legislation''' or '''sunset legislation''' are [[laws]] whose duration is limited at the time of enactment. Temporary laws are often used to adapt for unusual or peculiar situations. Clauses limiting the duration of such laws are often called "sunset" clauses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/t/temporary-statue/|title=Temporary Statue Law and Legal Definition - USLegal, Inc.|first=US Legal,|last=Inc.|website=definitions.uslegal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporary laws are commonly given temporal validity by the inclusion of an expiration date at which the law ceases to be in effect unless it is extended. But a law can also acquire temporal status by stipulating that it only applies to a certain event. For example, only to the next election or only for victims of a named catastrophe.

Temporary laws are favored by adherents of "[[Experimentalist governance]]" because it allows policy makers to conduct experiments and evaluate the effects of introducing legislation.

Temporary laws are often easier to pass since they last for a shorter time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2159549|title=Law and the Limits of Government: Temporary versus Permanent Legislation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temporary law should not be confused with ''ratione temporis'' or ''temporal jurisdiction'' which refers to the jurisdiction of a ''court'' of law in relation to the passage of time. 

== Examples ==
Some examples of temporary laws:
* [[May Laws]], enacted in [[Russia]] in 1882. Originally intended to expire after one year but were extended indefinitely.
* [[Tehcir Law]], enacted by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1915 authorized the [[ethnic cleansing]] of the empire's [[Armenians|Armenian]] population. 
* [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] passed in 1994 contained several provisions that were temporary in nature.
* [[Patriot Act]], enacted in the [[United States]] in 2001.
* [[Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law]], enacted in [[Israel]] in 2003.

The '''Text Creation Partnership''' ('''TCP''') is a not-for-profit organization based in the library of the [[University of Michigan]] {{as of
 |2000
 |alt=since 2000}}. Its purpose is to produce large-scale full-text electronic resources (especially in the humanities) on behalf of both member institutions (particularly academic libraries) and scholarly publishers, under an arrangement calculated to serve the needs of both, and in so doing to demonstrate the value of a business model that sees corporate and non-profit information-providers as potentially amicable collaborators rather than as antagonistic vendors and customers respectively.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview see {{cite journal

TCP has sponsored four text-creation projects to date. The first and the largest is "EEBO-TCP (Phase I)" (2001–2009), an effort to produce structurally marked-up full-text transcriptions of 25,000+ of the roughly 125,000 books to be found either in the Pollard and Redgrave and Wing [[short-title catalogue]]s of early English printed books, or among the [[Thomason Tracts]], that is, from among nearly all books, pamphlets, and broadsides published in English or in England before 1700. The books were selected and transcribed from the digital scans produced by [[ProQuest]] Information and Learning, and distributed by them as a web-based product under the name "'''Early English Books Online'''" (EEBO). The scans from which the texts were transcribed were themselves made from the microfilm copies made over the years by ProQuest and its antecedent companies, including the original University Microfilms, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | accessdate = 2007-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; EEBO-TCP Phase I concluded at the end of 2009, having transcribed about 25,300 titles, and immediately moved into EEBO-TCP Phase II (2009–), a sequel project dedicated to converting all the remaining unique English-language monographs (roughly 45,000 additional titles).

The third TCP project was Evans-TCP (2003–2007, with some ongoing work through 2010), an effort to transcribe 6,000 of the 36,000 pre-1800 titles listed in Charles Evans' ''American Bibliography,'' and distributed, again as page images scanned from microfilm copies, by [[Readex]], a division of [[NewsBank, Inc.]] under the name "[[Archive of Americana]]" ("Early American Imprints, series I: Evans, 1639–1800"). Evans-TCP has produced e-texts of nearly 5,000 books.

The final TCP project was ECCO-TCP (2005–2010, with some work ongoing), an effort to transcribe 10,000 eighteenth-century books from among the 136,000 titles available in [[Thomson-Gale]]'s web-based resource, "Eighteenth-Century Collections Online" (ECCO). ECCO-TCP ran out of funding in 2010 after transcribing about 3,000 (and editing about 2,400) titles.

==Organization==

The TCP is overseen by a Board of Directors, drawn chiefly from senior library administrators at partner institutions, representatives of the corporate partners, and the [[Council on Library and Information Resources]] (CLIR). The Board is assisted in matters of selection and scholarship by an academic advisory group that includes faculty in the fields of early modern English and American studies.

The TCP has informal ties to a number of University-based scholarly text projects, especially in helping to provide them with source texts with which to work. Institutions represented include Northwestern University (IL), Oxford University (UK), Washington University (St. Louis), the University of Sydney (Australia), the University of Toronto (ON), and the University of Victoria (BC). TCP has also worked with students by sponsoring an Undergraduate Essay Contest every year, convening task forces on the uses of TCP texts in pedagogy, and appealing to scholars and students for ideas on selection and use.

Text production is managed through the University of Michigan's [[Digital Library Production Service]] (DLPS), with its extensive experience in the production of SGML/XML-encoded electronic texts. DLPS is assisted by [[Oxford University's]] Bodleian Digital Libraries Systems &amp; Services (BDLSS), including the late [[Sebastian Rahtz]].&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.it.ox.ac.uk/martinw/2016/03/23/the-oxford-text-archive-2015/&lt;/ref&gt; Small part-time production operations have also been started within two other libraries: the Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies in Pratt Library (Victoria University in the University of Toronto), specializing in Latin books; and the National Library of Wales (Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru) in Aberystwyth, specializing in Welsh books.

==Commonalities==

All four TCP text projects are very similar. In each case:

# The TCP produces text from commercial image files that have in turn been created from microfilm copies of early books.
# The commercial image providers receive what is in effect a full-text index to their image product for much less than it would cost to produce themselves: value added to their product.
# The partner libraries actually own, rather than simply license, the resultant texts, and are free (subject to some conditions) to mount the texts themselves in whatever system they like, or use the texts internally as a tool of scholarship and teaching.
# The texts are created according to library-determined standards, uniform across multiple data-sets and potentially cross-searchable.
# Because they are created collaboratively, the texts are relatively inexpensive (on a per-book basis) and become more so with each library that joins the partnership.
# The texts will eventually be made freely accessible to the public at large.
# The selection of texts to convert, though differing from project to project, in each case follows similar principles: variety, significance, representative quality, avoidance of duplication; specific requests from faculty or scholarly initiatives at member institutions are also generally honored.
# TCP has been hitherto primarily interested in creating texts, not in creating a "product"; though texts from all three projects are or will be mounted on servers at the University of Michigan library, the Michigan site is not the official TCP site: any partner library with adequate resources and safeguards may do the same. EEBO-TCP texts, for example, are served by Michigan, ProQuest, the Oxford University Digital Library, and the University of Chicago.

==Standards==

All four TCP text projects are produced in the same way and to the same standards, which are documented, at least in part, on the [http://www.lib.umich.edu/tcp/docs/ TCP web site].

# '''Accuracy.''' The TCP strives to produce texts that are as accurately transcribed as possible, with a specified overall accuracy rate of 99.995% or better (i.e. one error or fewer per 20,000 characters).
# '''Keying.''' Given the nature of the material, the only method found to deliver such accuracy economically has been to have the books keyed by data conversion firms under contract.
# '''Quality control.''' Accuracy of transcription and aptness of markup are assessed in all cases by a group of library-based proofers and reviewers managed by the University of Michigan DLPS.
# '''Encoding.''' All resultant text files are marked up in valid SGML or XML (SGML is archived, XML is exported) conforming to a proprietary "Document Type Description" (DTD) derived from the P3/P4 version of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]] (TEI) standard.
# '''Purposeful markup.''' Compared to the full TEI, the TCP DTD is very simple and intended to capture only the features most useful for intelligible display, intelligent navigation, and productive searching. The TCP practice is to capture, so far as feasible, the overall hierarchical structure of each book (parts, sections, chapters, etc.); the features that tend to mark the beginnings and ends of divisions (headings, explicits, salutations, valedictions, datelines, bylines, epigraphs, etc.); the most significant elements of discourse and organization (paragraphs in prose, lines and stanzas in verse, speeches, speakers, and stage directions in drama, notes, block quotes, sequential numerations of all kinds); and only the most essential aspects of physical formatting (page breaks, lists, tables, font changes).
# '''Fidelity to the original.''' In each case, the text is intended to represent the book as originally printed, so far as that is possible. Printer's errors are preserved, hand-written changes are ignored, duplicate scans are omitted, out-of-order images are keyed in the intended order, and most of the unusual characters of the original are preserved.
# '''Ease of reading and searching.''' At the same time, though the transcriptions are carried out character-by-character, TCP, on the theory that all transcription is a kind of translation from one symbolic system to another, tends to define characters in terms more of their meaning than of their form, and to map eccentric letter-forms to meaningful modern equivalents, generally in keeping with the Unicode definition of "character."
# '''Languages.''' Though most of the TCP texts are in English, many are not. Books and divisions of books not in English are tagged with an appropriate language code, but are not otherwise distinguished.
# '''Omitted material.''' The TCP produces Latin-alphabet ''text''. Non-textual material such as musical notation, mathematical formulae, and illustrations (except for any text they may contain) are omitted and their locations marked with a special tag. Extended text in non-Latin alphabets (Greek, Hebrew, Persian, etc.) is also omitted.

==Accomplishments and prospects==

As of April 2011, the TCP had created about 40,000 searchable, navigable, full-text transcriptions of early books, a database of unmatched scope, scale, and utility to students in many fields. Whether it will be able to go on to produce the remaining 38,000 texts included in its ambitious recent plans (for EEBO-TCP Phase II) will depend on the validity of its original vision, arising from the theory that libraries could and should cooperate to become producers and standard-setters rather than consumers; and that universities and commercial firms, despite their very different life-cycles, constraints, and motives, could join in durable partnerships of benefit to all parties.

As of Jan 1, 2015, the full text of the EEBO phase I has been released under a Creative Commons License, and can be freely downloaded and distributed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/2014/12/24/eebo-tcp-phase-i-public-release-what-to-expect-on-january-1/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 there were 28,466 titles available via Phase II. As of July 2015, ProQuest had the exclusive right for five years to distribute the EEBO-TCP Phase II collection. After those five years the texts will be made freely available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/tcp-eebo/|title=EEBO-TCP: Early English Books Online - Text Creation Partnership|website=www.textcreationpartnership.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:3pillars originofpoliticalorder.gif|thumb|The three components/pillars of a stable state according to Fukuyama]]
'''''The Origins of Political Order''''' is a 2011 book by [[Political economy|political economist]] [[Francis Fukuyama]] about what makes a state stable. It uses a comparative [[political history]] to develop a theory of the stability of a [[political system]]. According to Fukuyama, a stable state needs to be modern and strong, to obey the rule of law governing the state and be accountable.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=312,420}}

{{toclimit|2}}

==Series of books==
The book is the first of two books on the development of [[Political system|political order]]. This book goes from its origins to the [[French Revolution]]. The next book ''[[Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Present Day]]'', published in September 2014, starts with the French Revolution and carries the analysis to the present day.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=furedi/&gt;&lt;ref name=hutton/&gt;&lt;ref name=hewson&gt;{{cite web|title=''Review'' review|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1261 |work=Reviews in History|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=degroot&gt;{{cite web|title= Francis Fukuyama's "The Origins of Political Order" |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-04-08/entertainment/35231561_1_central-authority-francis-fukuyama-democracy |work=Washington Post|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Fukuyama, ''[[Political Order and Political Decay: From the Industrial Revolution to the Globalization of Democracy]]''. Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why states and institutions fail==
The book is an attempt to understand why modern statebuilding and the building of institutions in countries like Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Haiti, Timor-Leste, Sierra Leone and Liberia have failed to live up to expectations.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|loc=Preface}}

In the aftermath of its 2003 invasion of Iraq, the US administration seemed genuinely surprised when the Iraqi state itself collapsed in an orgy of looting and civil conflict.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=13}}

The book is about "getting to Denmark," in other words creating stable, peaceful, prosperous, inclusive, and honest societies.&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite web|title=''How To Get to the End of History or "getting to Denmark"'' review|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2011/05/how_to_get_to_the_end_of_history.html |work=Slate|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuyama points out that at the time of writing ninety contemporary 'primitive' societies had been engaged in war,{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=73}} suggesting that political order is preferable to primitive social structures if stability is to be achieved. The author describes how attempts at shaping countries outside the western world into western type democracies failed, and that this book was an attempt to find out why, by trying to find the true origins of political order, by tracing the histories of China, India, Europe and some Muslim countries from the point of view of three components.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=312}}

==Aims==
Since the aim of the book is to understand how institutions and states develop in different countries, it is also a book on [[comparative historical research]].

It is an extension of [[Samuel P. Huntington]]'s ''[[Political Order in Changing Societies]]'' and similar in scope to [[Jared Diamond]]’s ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]''.&lt;ref name=sailer&gt;{{cite web|title= Fukuyama's World  |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/fukuyamas-world/ |work=The American Conservative|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukuyama develops his argument with respect to the history of China, India and the Middle East before focusing on the way European countries developed in a variety of directions.&lt;ref name=blackburn&gt;{{cite web|last=Blackburn|first=Robert|title=''The Origins of Political Order'' review|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-origins-of-political-order-from-prehuman-times-to-the-french-revolution-by-francis-fukuyama-2283020.html |work=The Independent|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==From pre-human origins to states==

===From chimpanzee hunting groups to tribes===
In his quest for the origins of political order, he first looks at the social order among chimpanzees, notes that the war-like hunting group, rather than the family, was the primary social group, and claims the same for humans. Humans went further: to survive they formed tribes, whose armies were superior to hunting groups by their sheer size.&lt;ref name= hewson &gt;{{cite web|title=''Review'' review|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/1261 |work=Reviews in History|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=degroot&gt;{{cite web|title= Francis Fukuyama's "The Origins of Political Order" |url=
https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2011-04-08/entertainment/35231561_1_central-authority-francis-fukuyama-democracy |work=Washington Post|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marq&gt;{{cite web|title= Review|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2011/06/fukuyama-order-state-india |work=New Statesman|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=burl&gt;{{cite web|title=  A dense study of global political development |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/8540907/The-Origins-of-Political-Order-by-Francis-Fukuyama-review.html |work=The Telegraph|accessdate=20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He uses recent work in sociobiology and other sources to show that sociability built on kin selection and reciprocal altruism is the original default social state of man and not any isolated, presocial human as suggested by [[Hobbes]] and [[Rousseau]].&lt;ref name=lind&gt;{{cite web|last=Lind|first=Michael|title=''Francis Fukuyama's Theory of the State'' review|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/17/books/review/book-review-the-origins-of-political-order-by-francis-fukuyama.html?pagewanted=all |work=New York Times|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=439}} He suggests that Hobbes and Locke present a fallacy when they argue humans developed cooperative ability only as a result of the invention of the state. This is because chimps, the genetic ancestors to humans, engage in kin relations based on cooperation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Waal|first1=Frans|title=Chimpanzee Politics|date=2007|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8656-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so Hobbes and Locke must be suggesting humans were once sociable, lost this instinct and then regained it due to the state.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=34}}

===Challenge of tribes on the road towards the state===
The next step was to escape beyond tribalism and the "tyranny of cousins", to join tribes into larger coalitions&lt;ref name=blackburn/&gt; towards states, again due to the advantage of larger armies. This was done with the aid of religion.&lt;ref name=burl/&gt; This was because as groups grew in size, maintaining cooperation became more difficult as face-to-face interactions with much of society became difficult. Religion offered a way of providing a combining social force to hold society together .{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=37}} For example, Fukuyama cites [[Mohammed]] as an example of what Weber labels a "[[charismatic leader]]" because he used the idea of an '[[umma]]' (community of believers) to bind together the territory that he ruled over .{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=87}} This challenge to transcend tribalism partly remains today in many parts of the world that is outside Western civilization, for example in Afghanistan and in Somalia.&lt;ref name=burl/&gt;

====Restrictions on marriage and inheritance as a strategy against corruption====
Loyalty to the tribe or the family, rather than to the state, leads to corruption and weakening of the state. Various strategies were used to overcome the corruption. One such strategy was restrictions against marriage among the ruling official class to make sure that loyalties would not lie with family or tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuyama 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandarins or [[Scholar-official]]s, who were the ruling class of China, were not allowed to pass on the lands given to them by the emperor to their own children and were restricted as to whom they were allowed to marry.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=116,367}}

[[Mamluk]] slaves, the ruling class of Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, were told which slaves to marry while their children could not inherit from them.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=198}}[[Jannissary|Jannisarries]] were originally forced into celibacy or and prohibited from having a family.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=219}}{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=225}}

[[Pope Gregory VII]] forced Catholic priests in Europe to become celibate and they were prohibited from having a family for the same reason.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=264}}

Spanish administrators in South America were restricted from to marrying local women and from establishing family ties in the territories they were sent to.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=367}}

==Three components of political order==
The books develops the idea of the development of the three components of a modern political order, which are,{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=312,420}}
# '''[[State (polity)#The modern state|State building]]'''
# '''[[Rule of law]]'''
# '''Accountable government'''

[[China]], [[India]], the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] and Europe each developed these three components of political organization in different order, in different ways and to different degrees. Denmark and the United Kingdom arrived first at a modern balance of the three components in a single package, follow by others by the nineteenth century, as the Netherlands and Sweden.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=421}}

[[File:Fukuyama article2.png|thumb|Origins of Political Order depend on three components, according to Fukuyama. States with all three components, are more stable, and are shown in the middle.]]

===China===
China is described as having the first modern state,&lt;ref name=econom1&gt;{{cite web|title=''The good, the great and the gelded'' review|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18483257 |work=The Economist|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the definition given, since it established an educated Mandarin bureaucracy, although Hewson objects to this conclusion since the Mandarin bureaucracy was not modern.&lt;ref name=hewson/&gt; China used extreme violence on its population (especially during the influence of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]]{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=120}}), but had a weak rule of law and the emperor had no accountability to anyone.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

===India===
India is contrasted with China. India could not use extreme force on its population due to the traditional power of the [[brahmin]] [[priestly caste]], who protested violence against the populace and war against neighboring states, by refusing to perform ancestral rituals for the [[Raja]] leaders. The power of the Brahmins weakening the state's power over its people, and effectively forced a strong accountability on its leaders to the population of India via its priestly class.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=158-167}} An example Fukuyama gives of the influence religion had on early Indian rulers is [[Ashoka]] (304–232 BCE) of the [[Maurya Dynasty]], who under the influence of Buddhism (rather than Brahmanism) came to regret his conquests in the Kalinga War. He vowed to end his empire, and eventually the entire political system collapsed.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=182}}

===Muslim states===
Certain Muslim states developed the practice of making imported slaves as the ruling class, as with the [[Mamluk]]s of Egypt and the Janissaries of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empire, a process which started around the 8th century. Since these ruling class slaves were neither beholden to family nor to any tribe, but dependent only on the state, it ensured their loyalty towards the state.&lt;ref name=blackburn/&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=218-219}} A later example would be the 16th-century Ottoman Empire practice of seeking out intelligent Christian children for high civil service or military positions, who were cut off from their family for their training.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=190}}

===Europe===
In 11th-century Europe, instead of the state having the upper hand as in China, or the Brahmins having the upper hand as in India, there was a power conflict between state and church, the [[Investiture Controversy]] between [[Pope Gregory VII]] and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]].{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=266}}

The papal party started to search for sources of law to strengthen its case for the universal jurisdiction of the church. They rediscovered the Justinian Code, the [[Corpus Iuris Civilis]], in a library near Bologna in northern Italy in 1072, leading later to the student body called a "universitas", first in Bologna, and soon after in Paris, Oxford, Heidelberg, Cracow, and Copenhagen studying the code and displacing particularistic Salic law.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=268-269}} The laws gave the Gregory the authority to [[excommunicate]] Henry IV, who was forced to [[walk to Canossa]] from Germany to Italy, stand barefoot{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=168}} in the snow for three days{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=265}} outside Canossa and to ask forgiveness from the pope on his knees.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=268}} The [[Concordat of Worms]] ended the struggle between popes and emperors in 1122. It created balance between royal power and religious tradition not seen anywhere else before.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

Catholic leaders became accountable to the clergy and to the pope, who historically frequently objected to violence and wars, just as their counterparts in India had done, but in Europe the clergy did not weaken the states as much as Brahmins had done in India. The papal intercessions against wars between Catholic countries also led to the survival of small states in Europe, similar to India, but in contrast to what had happened in China. The existence of small states who were restricted by the church from recruiting mass armies waging wars costly in casualties, as had been the case in China, combined with the existence of independent university scholars, led to military innovations on land and sea to empower fewer soldiers to wield wars effectively and later gave these relatively small countries a military advantage large enough to conquer colonies in the rest of the world. Western Europe began getting the best of both worlds. In England, the rise of common law also strengthened the rule of law. With the reformation, the Lutheran priest N.F.S. Grundtvig in Denmark advocated general literacy since they believed that every Christian should read the bible and established schools throughout the country, leading to voting rights 1849.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=266&amp;ndash;434}} In Denmark this led to the state gradually being more accountable to the general population, since they could now vote and read. In England and Denmark a balance was finally struck between the three components of political order.&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|pp=266&amp;ndash;269}}

==Balance between the components==
A successful modern liberal democracy balances all three components to achieve stability.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=6,188}}

In China a strong modern state came to power first and the state subjugated any potential agents that might have demanded the other two components. In China, the priestly class did not develop into an organized independent religion, as the priests were in the service of the Emperor. Numerous times, therefore, imperial dynasties collapsed.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=151}}&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

In India, the Brahmins became organised into a strong upper caste of India and the warrior/state caste was held to account by a rule of law as interpreted by the Brahmins. Because of the state was weakened by this limitation, attempts at unifying India under one rule did not last very long.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=183}}&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

In Europe, there was a long period when the emperors and popes were in conflict, creating a balance of power between them,&lt;ref name=morris/&gt; and ultimately leading to a situation where some small states developed a stable balance between the three components in the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Fukuyama|2011|p=421}}&lt;ref name=morris/&gt;

He was a leading member of the [[Frankfurt School]] of critical theory, whose work has come to be associated with thinkers such as [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Herbert Marcuse]], for whom the works of [[Freud]], [[Marx]], and [[Hegel]] were essential to a critique of modern society. He is widely regarded as one of the 20th century's foremost thinkers on aesthetics and philosophy, as well as one of its preeminent essayists. As a critic of both fascism and what he called the [[culture industry]], his writings—such as ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1947), ''[[Minima Moralia]]'' (1951) and ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' (1966)—strongly influenced the European [[New Left]].

Amidst the vogue enjoyed by [[existentialism]] and [[positivism]] in early 20th-century Europe, Adorno advanced a dialectical conception of natural history that critiqued the twin temptations of [[ontology]] and [[empiricism]] through studies of [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Husserl]]. As a classically trained pianist whose sympathies with the twelve-tone technique of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] resulted in his studying composition with [[Alban Berg]] of the [[Second Viennese School]], Adorno's commitment to avant-garde music formed the backdrop of his subsequent writings and led to his collaboration with [[Thomas Mann]] on the latter's novel ''[[Doctor Faustus (Thomas Mann novel)|Doctor Faustus]]'', while the two men lived in California as exiles during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Working for the newly relocated [[Institute for Social Research]], Adorno collaborated on influential studies of [[authoritarianism]], [[antisemitism]] and [[propaganda]] that would later serve as models for sociological studies the Institute carried out in post-war Germany.

Upon his return to Frankfurt, Adorno was involved with the reconstitution of German intellectual life through debates with [[Karl Popper]] on the limitations of positivist science, critiques of [[Heidegger]]'s language of authenticity, writings on German responsibility for [[the Holocaust]], and continued interventions into matters of public policy. As a writer of polemics in the tradition of [[Nietzsche]] and [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], Adorno delivered scathing critiques of contemporary Western culture. Adorno's posthumously published ''[[Aesthetic Theory]]'', which he planned to dedicate to [[Samuel Beckett]], is the culmination of a lifelong commitment to modern art which attempts to revoke the "fatal separation" of feeling and understanding long demanded by the history of philosophy and explode the privilege aesthetics accords to content over form and contemplation over immersion.

==Life and career==

===Early years: Frankfurt===
Theodor W. Adorno (alias: Theodor Adorno-Wiesengrund) was born as Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund in [[Frankfurt am Main]] on September 11, 1903, the only child of Oscar Alexander Wiesengrund (1870–1946) and Maria Calvelli-Adorno della Piana (1865–1952). His mother, a devout [[Catholic]] from [[Corsica]], was once a professional singer, while his father, an [[assimilated Jew]] who had [[Conversion to Christianity|converted]] to [[Protestantism]], ran a successful wine-export business. Proud of her origins, Maria wanted her son's paternal surname to be supplemented by the addition of her own name: Adorno. Thus his earliest publications carried the name Theodor Wiesengrund-Adorno; upon his application for [[US citizenship]], his name was modified to Theodor W. Adorno.

His childhood was marked by the musical life provided by his mother and aunt: Maria was a singer who could boast of having performed in Vienna at the Imperial Court, while her sister, Agathe, who lived with them, had made a name for herself as both a singer and pianist. He was not only a precocious child but, as he recalled later in life, a child prodigy who could play pieces by [[Beethoven]] on the piano by the time he was twelve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of six, he attended the Deutschherren middle school before transferring to the Kaiser-Wilhelm [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]], where he studied from 1913 to 1921. Prior to his graduation at the top of his class, Adorno was already swept up by the revolutionary mood of the time, as is evidenced by his reading of [[Georg Lukács]]'s ''The Theory of the Novel'' that year, as well as by his fascination with [[Ernst Bloch]]'s ''The Spirit of Utopia'', of which he would later write:
{{quote|Bloch's was a philosophy that could hold its head high before the most advanced literature; a philosophy that was not calibrated to the abominable resignation of methodology ... I took this motif so much as my own that I do not believe I have ever written anything without reference to it, either implicit or explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|1992|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yet Adorno's intellectual nonconformism was no less shaped by the repugnance he felt towards the nationalism which swept through the Reich during the [[World War I|First World War]]. Along with future collaborators like [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and Ernst Bloch, Adorno was profoundly disillusioned by the ease with which Germany's intellectual and spiritual leaders—among them [[Max Weber]], [[Max Scheler]], [[Georg Simmel]], as well as his friend [[Siegfried Kracauer]]—came out in support of the war. The younger generation's distrust for traditional knowledge arose from the way in which this tradition had discredited itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Claussen|2008|page=66–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, Oscar Wiesengrund's firm established close professional and personal ties with the factory of Karplus &amp; Herzberger in Berlin. The eldest daughter of the Karplus family, Margarete, or Gretel, moved in the intellectual circles of Berlin, where she was acquainted with Walter Benjamin, [[Bertolt Brecht]] and Ernst Bloch, each of whom Adorno would become familiar with during the mid-1920s; after fourteen years, Gretel and Theodor were married in 1937.

At the end of his schooldays, Adorno not only benefited from the rich concert offerings of Frankfurt—where one could hear performances of works by Schoenberg, [[Schreker]], [[Stravinsky]], [[Bartók]], [[Busoni]], [[Frederick Delius|Delius]] and [[Hindemith]]—but also began studying music composition at the [[Hoch Conservatory]] while taking private lessons with well-respected composers [[Bernhard Sekles]] and Eduard Jung. At around the same time, he befriended Siegfried Kracauer, the ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]''{{'}}s literary editor, of whom he would later write:
{{quote|For years Kracauer read [Kant's] ''Critique of Pure Reason'' with me regularly on Saturday afternoons. I am not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that I owe more to this reading than to my academic teachers ... Under his guidance I experienced the work from the beginning not as mere epistemology, not as an analysis of the conditions of scientifically valid judgments, but as a kind of coded text from which the historical situation of spirit could be read, with the vague expectation that in doing so one could acquire something of truth itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|1992|page=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Leaving gymnasium to study philosophy, psychology and sociology at [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University]] in Frankfurt, Adorno continued his readings with Kracauer, turning now to [[Hegel]] and [[Kierkegaard]], and began publishing concert reviews and pieces of music for distinguished journals like the ''Zeitschrift für Musik'', the ''Neue Blätter für Kunst und Literatur'' and later for the ''Musikblätter des Anbruch''. In these articles, Adorno championed avant-garde music at the same time as he critiqued the failings of musical modernity, as in the case of Stravinsky's ''[[Histoire du soldat|The Soldier's Tale]]'', which he called in 1923 a "dismal Bohemian prank."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these early writings, he was unequivocal in his condemnation of performances which either sought or pretended to achieve a transcendence which Adorno, in line with many intellectuals of the time, regarded as impossible: "No cathedral," he wrote, "can be built if no community desires one."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the summer of 1924, Adorno received his doctorate with a study of [[Edmund Husserl]] under the direction of the unorthodox neo-Kantian [[Hans Cornelius]].  Before his graduation, Adorno had already met with his most important intellectual collaborators, [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Walter Benjamin]]. Through Cornelius's seminars, Adorno met his future collaborator Max Horkheimer, through whom he was then introduced to [[Friedrich Pollock]].

===Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin===

During the summer of 1924, the Viennese composer [[Alban Berg]]'s "Three Fragments from [[Wozzeck]]", op. 7 premiered in Frankfurt, at which time Adorno introduced himself to Berg and both agreed the young philosopher and composer would study with Berg in Vienna. Upon moving to Vienna in February 1925, Adorno immersed himself in the musical culture which had grown up around Schoenberg: in addition to his twice-weekly sessions with Berg, Adorno continued his studies on piano with [[Eduard Steuermann]] and befriended the violinist [[Rudolf Kolisch]]. In Vienna, he attended public lectures of the satirist [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] with Berg and met [[Lukács]], who had been living in Vienna after the failure of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]. Alban Berg, the man Adorno referred to as "my master and teacher", was among the most prescient of his young pupil's early friends:

{{quote|[I am] convinced that, in the sphere of the deepest understanding of music ... you are capable of supreme achievements and will undoubtedly fulfill this promise in the shape of great philosophical works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
After leaving Vienna, Adorno traveled through Italy, where he met with Kracauer, Benjamin, and the economist [[Alfred Sohn-Rethel]], with whom he developed a lasting friendship, before returning to Frankfurt. In December 1926 Adorno's "Two Pieces for String Quartet", op. 2 were performed in Vienna, which provided a welcome interruption from his preparations for the [[Habilitation]]. After writing the "Piano Pieces in strict twelve-tone technique", as well as songs later integrated into the ''Six Bagatelles for Voice and Piano'', op. 6, Adorno presented his [[Habilitation]] manuscript, ''The Concept of the Unconscious in the Transcendental Theory of the Psyche'' (''Der Begriff des Unbewußten in der transzendentalen Seelenlehre''), to [[Hans Cornelius|Cornelius]] in November 1927. Cornelius advised Adorno to withdraw his application on the grounds that the manuscript was too close to his own way of thinking. In this manuscript, Adorno attempted to underline the epistemological status of the [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] as it emerged from [[Freud]]'s early writings. Against the function of the unconscious in both [[Nietzsche]] and [[Spengler]], Adorno argued that Freud's notion of the unconscious serves as a "sharp weapon ... against every attempt to create a metaphysics of the instincts and to deify full, organic nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Undaunted by his academic prospects, Adorno threw himself once again into composition. In addition to publishing numerous  reviews of opera performances and concerts, Adorno's "Four Songs for Medium Voice and Piano", op. 3 was performed in Berlin in January 1929. Between 1928 and 1930 Adorno took on a greater role within the editorial committee of the ''Musikblätter des Anbruch''. In a proposal for transforming the journal, Adorno sought to use ''Anbruch'' for championing radical modern music against what he called the "stabilized music" of [[Hans Pfitzner|Pfitzner]], the later [[Strauss]], as well as the [[neoclassicism]] of [[Stravinsky]] and [[Hindemith]]. During this period he published the essays "Night Music", "On Twelve-Tone Technique" and "Reaction and Progress". Yet his reservations about twelve-tone orthodoxy became steadily more pronounced: According to Adorno, [[twelve-tone technique]]'s use of [[atonality]] can no more be regarded as an authoritative canon than can [[tonality]] be relied on to provide instructions for the composer.

At this time, Adorno struck up a correspondence with the composer [[Ernst Krenek]], with whom he discussed problems of atonality and twelve-tone technique. In a letter of 1934 Adorno sounded a related criticism of Schoenberg:

{{quote|Twelve-tone technique alone is nothing but the principle of motivic elaboration and variation, as developed in the sonata, but elevated now to a comprehensive principle of construction, namely transformed into an ''a priori'' form and, by that token, detached from the surface of the composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
At this point Adorno reversed his earlier priorities: now his musical activities came second to the development of a philosophical theory of aesthetics. Thus, in the middle of 1929 he accepted [[Paul Tillich]]'s offer to present an Habilitation on [[Kierkegaard]], which Adorno eventually submitted under the title ''The Construction of the Aesthetic''. At the time, [[Kierkegaard]]'s philosophy exerted a strong influence, chiefly through its claim to pose an alternative to [[Idealism]] and [[Hegel]]'s philosophy of history. Yet when Adorno turned his attention to [[Kierkegaard]], watchwords like "anxiety," "inwardness" and "leap"—instructive for [[Existentialism|existentialist philosophy]]—were detached from their theological origins and posed, instead, as problems for aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the work proceeded—and [[Kierkegaard]]'s overcoming of [[Hegel]]'s idealism was revealed to be a mere interiorization—Adorno excitedly remarked in a letter to [[Alban Berg|Berg]] that he was writing without looking over his shoulder at the faculty who would soon evaluate his work. Receiving favourable reports from Professors Tillich and Horkheimer, as well as Benjamin and Kracauer, the University conferred on Adorno the ''[[venia legendi]]'' in February 1931; on the very day his revised study was published, 23 March 1933, [[Hitler]] seized dictatorial powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months after qualifying as a lecturer in philosophy, Adorno delivered an inaugural lecture at the [[Institute for Social Research]], an independent organization which had recently appointed Horkheimer as its director and, with the arrival of the literary scholar [[Leo Lowenthal]], social psychologist [[Erich Fromm]] and philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]], sought to exploit recent theoretical and methodological advances in the social sciences. His lecture, "The Actuality of Philosophy," created a scandal. In it, Adorno not only deviated from the theoretical program Horkheimer had laid out a year earlier, but challenged philosophy's very capacity for comprehending reality as such: "For the mind," Adorno announced, "is indeed not capable of producing or grasping the totality of the real, but it may be possible to penetrate the detail, to explode in miniature the mass of merely existing reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|2000|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with [[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]'s ''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'' and preliminary sketches of the [[Arcades Project]], Adorno likened philosophical interpretation to experiments which should be conducted "until they arrive at figurations in which the answers are legible, while the questions themselves vanish." Having lost its position as the Queen of the Sciences, philosophy must now radically transform its approach to objects so that it might "construct keys before which reality springs open."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|2000|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Horkheimer's taking up the directorship of the Institute, a new journal, ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'', was produced to publish the research of Institute members both before and after its relocation to the United States. Though Adorno was not himself an Institute member, the journal nevertheless published many of his essays, including "The Social Situation of Music" (1932), "On Jazz" (1936), "On the Fetish-Character in Music and the Regression of Listening" (1938) and "Fragments on Wagner" (1938). In his new role as social theorist, Adorno's philosophical analysis of cultural phenomena heavily relied on the language of [[historical materialism]], as concepts like [[reification (Marxism)|reification]], [[false consciousness]] and [[ideology]] came to play an ever more prominent role in his work. At the same time, however, and owing to both the presence of another prominent sociologist at the Institute, [[Karl Mannheim]], as well as the methodological problem posed by treating objects—like "musical material"—as ciphers of social contradictions, Adorno was compelled to abandon any notion of "value-free" sociology in favour of a form of ideology critique which held on to an idea of truth. Before his emigration in autumn 1934, Adorno began work on a ''Singspiel'' based on [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' entitled ''The Treasure of Indian Joe'', which he would, however, never complete; by the time he fled [[Hitler]]'s Germany Adorno had already written over a hundred opera or concert reviews and an additional fifty critiques of music composition.

As the [[Nazi]] party became the largest party in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] Horkheimer's 1932 observation proved typical for his milieu: "Only one thing is certain", he wrote, "the irrationality of society has reached a point where only the gloomiest predictions have any plausibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September Adorno's right to teach was revoked; in March, as the [[swastika]] was run up the flag pole of town hall, the Institute's offices were searched by the Frankfurt criminal police. Adorno's house on Seeheimer Strasse was similarly searched in July and his application for membership in the Reich Chamber of Literature was denied on the grounds that membership was limited to "persons who belong to the German nation by profound ties of character and blood. As a non-[[Aryan race|Aryan]]," he was informed, "you are unable to feel and appreciate such an obligation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards Adorno was forced into fifteen years of exile.

===Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles===

After the possibility of transferring his [[habilitation]] to the [[University of Vienna]] came to nothing, Adorno considered relocating to Britain upon his father's suggestion.  With the help of the [[Academic Assistance Council]], Adorno registered as an advanced student at [[Merton College]], Oxford, in June 1934. During the next four years at Oxford, Adorno made repeated trips to Germany to see both his parents and Gretel, who was still working in Berlin. Under the direction of [[Gilbert Ryle]], Adorno worked on a dialectical critique of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]]'s epistemology. By this time, the [[Institute for Social Research]] had relocated to New York City and began making overtures to Adorno. After months of strained relations, [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]] and Adorno reestablished their essential theoretical alliance during meetings in Paris. Adorno continued writing on music, publishing "The Form of the Phonograph Record" and "Crisis of Music Criticism" with the Viennese musical journal ''23'', "On Jazz" in the Institute's ''Zeitschrift'', "Farewell to Jazz" in ''Europäische Revue''. Yet Adorno's attempts to break out of the sociology of music were, at this time, twice thwarted: neither the study of Mannheim he had been working on for years nor extracts from his study of Husserl were accepted by the ''Zeitschrift''. Impressed by Horkheimer's book of aphorisms, ''Dawn and Decline'', Adorno began working on his own book of aphorisms, what would later become ''Minima Moralia''. While at Oxford, Adorno suffered two great losses: his Aunt Agathe died in June 1935, while Alban Berg died in December of the same year. To the end of his life, Adorno never abandoned the hope of completing [[Alban Berg|Berg]]'s unfinished [[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]].

At this time, Adorno was in intense correspondence with [[Walter Benjamin]] on the subject of the latter's ''[[Arcades Project]]''. After receiving an invitation from Horkheimer to visit the Institute in New York, Adorno sailed for New York on June 9, 1937 and stayed there for two weeks. While in New York, Max Horkheimer's essays "The Latest Attack on Metaphysics" and "Traditional and Critical Theory," which would soon become instructive for the Institute's self-understanding, were the subject of intense discussion. Soon after his return to Europe, Gretel moved to Britain, where she and Adorno were married on September 8, 1937; a little over a month later, Horkheimer telegrammed from New York with news of a position Adorno could take up with the [[Radio Project|Princeton Radio Project]], then under the directorship of the Austrian sociologist [[Paul Lazarsfeld]]. Yet Adorno's work continued with studies of [[Beethoven]] and [[Richard Wagner]] (published in 1939 as "Fragments on Wagner"), drafts of which he read to Benjamin during their final meeting, in December on the Italian Riviera. According to Benjamin, these drafts were astonishing for "the precision of their materialist deciphering," as well as the way in which "musical facts ... had been made socially transparent in a way that was completely new to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=237, 239}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his Wagner study, the thesis later to characterize ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]''—man's domination of nature—first emerges. Adorno sailed for New York on February 16, 1938. Soon after settling into his new home on Riverside Drive, Adorno met with Lazarsfeld in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] to discuss the Project's plans for investigating the impact of broadcast music.

Although he was expected to embed the Project's research within a wider theoretical context, it soon became apparent that the Project was primarily concerned with [[data collection]] to be used by administrators for establishing whether groups of listeners could be targeted by broadcasts specifically aimed at them. Expected to make use of devices with which listeners could press a button to indicate whether they liked or disliked a particular piece of music, Adorno bristled with distaste and astonishment:  "I reflected that culture was simply the condition that precluded a mentality that tried to measure it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Adorno suggested using individual interviews to determine listener reactions and, only three months after meeting Lazarsfeld, completed a 160-page memorandum on the Project's topic, "Music in Radio." Adorno was primarily interested in how the musical material was affected by its distribution through the medium of radio and thought it imperative to understand how music was affected by its becoming part of daily life. "The meaning of a Beethoven symphony," he wrote, "heard while the listener is walking around or lying in bed is very likely to differ from its effect in a concert-hall where people sit as if they were in church."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essays published by the Institute's ''Zeitschrift'', Adorno dealt with that atrophy of musical culture which had become instrumental in accelerating tendencies—towards [[conformity|conformism]], trivialization and standardization—already present in the larger culture. Unsurprisingly, Adorno's studies found little resonance among members of the project. At the end of 1939, when Lazarsfeld submitted a second application for funding, the musical section of the study was duly left out. Yet during the two years during which he worked on the Project, Adorno was nevertheless prolific, publishing "The Radio Symphony", "A Social Critique of Radio Music", and "On Popular Music", texts which, along with the draft memorandum and other unpublished writings, are now found in Robert Hullot-Kentor's recent translation, ''Current of Music''. In light of this situation, Horkheimer soon found a permanent post for Adorno at the Institute.

In addition to helping with the ''Zeitschrift'', Adorno was expected to be the Institute's liaison with Benjamin, who soon passed on to New York the study of [[Charles Baudelaire]] he hoped would serve as a model of the larger ''Arcades Project''. In correspondence, the two men discussed the difference in their conceptions of the relationship between critique and artworks which had become manifest through Benjamin's "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|The Work of Art in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility]]". At around the same time Adorno and Horkheimer began planning for a joint work on "dialectical logic", which would later become ''Dialectic of Enlightenment''. Alarmed by reports from Europe, where Adorno's parents suffered increasing discrimination and Benjamin was interned in [[Colombes]], their joint study could entertain few delusions about its practical effects. "In view of what is now threatening to engulf Europe," Horkheimer wrote, "our present work is essentially destined to pass things down through the night that is approaching: a kind of message in a bottle."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Adorno continued his work in New York with radio talks on music and a lecture on Søren Kierkegaard's doctrine of love, Benjamin fled Paris and attempted to make an illegal border crossing. After learning that his Spanish visa was invalid and fearing deportation back to France, Benjamin took an overdose of morphine tablets. In light of recent events, the Institute set about formulating a theory of antisemitism and fascism. On one side were those who supported [[Franz Leopold Neumann|Franz Neumann]]'s thesis according to which [[National Socialism]] was a form of "[[monopoly capitalism|monopoly capital]]"; on the other were those who supported [[Friedrich Pollock]]'s "[[state capitalist]] theory." Horkheimer's contributions to this debate, in the form of the essays "The Authoritarian State", "The End of Reason", and "The Jews and Europe" served as a foundation for what he and Adorno planned to do in their book on dialectical logic.

In November 1941 Adorno followed Horkheimer to what [[Thomas Mann]] called "German California",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Claussen|2008|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; setting up house in a [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] neighborhood of German émigrés which included [[Bertolt Brecht]] and Arnold Schoenberg. Adorno arrived with  a draft of his ''Philosophy of New Music'', a dialectical critique of twelve-tone music, which Adorno himself felt, while writing, was already a departure from the theory of art he had spent the previous decades elaborating. Horkheimer's reaction to the manuscript was wholly positive: "If I have ever in the whole of my life felt enthusiasm about anything, then I did on this occasion," he wrote after reading the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two set about completing their joint work, which transformed itself from a book on dialectical logic to a rewriting of the history of rationality and the Enlightenment. First published in a small mimeographed edition in May 1944 as ''Philosophical Fragments'', the text would wait another three years before achieving book form when it was published with its definitive title, ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', by the Amsterdam publisher Querido Verlag. This "reflection on the destructive aspect of progress" proceeded through the chapters which treated rationality as both the liberation from and further domination of nature, interpretations of both [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the [[Marquis de Sade]], as well as analyses of the culture industry and antisemitism.

With their joint work completed, the two turned their attention to studies on antisemitism and authoritarianism in collaboration with the [[Nevitt Sanford]]-led Public Opinion Study Group and the [[American Jewish Committee]]. In line with these studies, Adorno produced an analysis of the Californian radio preacher Martin Luther Thomas. Fascist propaganda of this sort, Adorno wrote, "simply takes people for what they are: genuine children of today's standardized mass culture who have been robbed to a great extent of their autonomy and spontaneity"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of these labors, the 1950 study ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' was pioneering in its combination of quantitative and qualitative methods of collecting and evaluating data as well as its development of the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]].

After the USA entered the war in 1941, the situation of the émigrés, now classed "[[enemy aliens]]", became increasingly restricted. Forbidden from leaving their homes between 8pm and 6am and prohibited from going more than five miles from their houses, émigrés like Adorno, who would not be naturalized until November 1943, were severely restricted in their movements.

In addition to the aphorisms which conclude ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', Adorno put together a collection of aphorisms in honor of Horkheimer's fiftieth birthday that would later be published as ''Minima Moralia: Reflections from Damaged Life''. These fragmentary writings, inspired by a renewed reading of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], treated issues like [[emigration]], [[totalitarianism]], and [[individuality]], as well as everyday matters such as giving presents, dwelling and the impossibility of love. In California, Adorno made the acquaintance of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and became friends with [[Fritz Lang]] and [[Hanns Eisler]], with whom he completed a study of film music in 1944. In this study, the authors pushed for the greater usage of avant-garde music in film, urging that music be used to supplement, not simply accompany, the visual aspect of films. Additionally, Adorno assisted [[Thomas Mann]] on his novel ''[[Doktor Faustus|Doctor Faustus]]'' after the latter asked for his help. "Would you be willing," Mann wrote, "to think through with me how the work—I mean Leverkühn's work—might look; how you would do it if you were in league with the Devil?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of October 1949, Adorno left America for Europe just as ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' was being published. Before his return, Adorno had not only reached an agreement with a Tübingen publisher to print an expanded version of ''Philosophy of New Music'', but completed two compositions: ''Four Songs for Voice and Piano by Stefan George, op.7'', and ''Three Choruses for Female Voices from the Poems of Theodor Däubler, op. 8''.

===Post-war Europe===

====Return to Frankfurt University====
Upon his return, Adorno helped shape the political culture of West Germany. Until his death in 1969, twenty years after his return, Adorno contributed to the intellectual foundations of the Federal Republic, as a professor at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt University]], critic of the vogue enjoyed by Heideggerian philosophy, partisan of critical sociology, and teacher of music at the [[Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music]]. Adorno resumed his teaching duties at the university soon after his arrival,{{when|date=September 2012}} with seminars on "Kant's Transcendental Dialectic", aesthetics, Hegel, "Contemporary Problems in the Theory of Knowledge", and "The Concept of Knowledge". Adorno's surprise at his students' passionate interest in intellectual matters did not, however, blind him to continuing problems within Germany: The literary climate was dominated by writers who had remained in Germany during Hitler's rule, the government re-employed people who had been active in the Nazi apparatus and people were generally loath to own up to their own collaboration or the guilt they thus incurred. Instead, the ruined city of Frankfurt continued as if nothing had happened,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} holding on to ideas of the true, the beautiful, and the good despite the atrocities, hanging on to a culture that had itself been lost in rubble or killed off in the concentration camps. All the enthusiasm Adorno's students showed for intellectual matters could not erase the suspicion that, in the words of [[Max Frisch]], culture had become an "alibi" for the absence of political consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the foundations for what would come to be known as "The Frankfurt School" were soon laid: Horkheimer resumed his chair in social philosophy and the Institute for Social Research, rebuilt, became a lightning rod for critical thought.

====Essays on fascism====
Starting with his 1947 essay ''Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler'',&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, TW (1947) ''Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler'' in ''Kenyan Review'' Vol.ix (1)&lt;/ref&gt; Adorno produced a series of influential works to describe psychological fascist traits. One of these works was ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950),&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, [http://ada.evergreen.edu/~arunc/texts/frankfurt/ap/politics.pdf ''Politics and Economics in the Interview Material''], ch.17&lt;/ref&gt; published as a contribution to the ''Studies in Prejudice'' performed by multiple research institutes in the US, and consisting of a '[[qualitative research|qualitative interpretation]]s' that uncovered the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] character of test persons through indirect questions.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} The books have had a major influence on sociology and remain highly discussed and debated. In 1951 he continued on the topic with his essay ''Freudian Theory and the Pattern of Fascist Propaganda'', in which he said that "Psychological dispositions do not actually cause fascism; rather, fascism defines a psychological area which can be successfully exploited by the forces which promote it for entirely non-psychological reasons of self-interest."&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, Espen (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=X3L5R3kiOh4C&amp;pg=PA56 ''Adorno and the political''], pp.56–7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 Adorno participated in a group experiment, revealing residual National Socialist attitudes among the recently democratized Germans. He then published two influential essays, ''The Meaning of Working Through the Past'' (1959), and ''Education after Auschwitz'' (1966), in which he argued on the survival of the uneradicated [[National Socialism]] in the [[mind-set]]s and institutions of the post-1945 Germany, and that there is still a real risk that it could rise again.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer (2006) p.69&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, however, Jean Améry—who had been tortured at Auschwitz—would sharply object that Adorno, rather than addressing such political concerns, was exploiting Auschwitz for his metaphysical phantom "absolute negativity" ("absolute Negativität"), using a language intoxicated by itself ("von sich selber bis zur Selbstblendung entzückte Sprache").&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Dorschel, 'Der Geist ist stets gestört', in: ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' nr. 129 (7 June 2004), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public events====
In September 1951 Adorno returned to the United States for a six-week visit, during which he attended the opening of the Hacker Psychiatry Foundation in Beverly Hills, met [[Leo Lowenthal]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]] in New York and saw his mother for the last time. After stopping in Paris, where he met [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]], [[Michel Leiris]] and [[René Leibowitz]], Adorno delivered a lecture entitled "The Present State of Empirical Social Research in Germany" at a conference on opinion research. Here he emphasized the importance of data collection and statistical evaluation while asserting that such empirical methods have only an auxiliary function and must lead to the formation of theories which would "raise the harsh facts to the level of consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Horkheimer as dean of the Arts Faculty, then rector of the university, responsibilities for the Institute's work fell upon Adorno. At the same time, however, Adorno renewed his musical work: with talks at the Kranichsteiner Musikgesellschaft, another in connection with a production of [[Ernst Krenek]]'s opera ''[[Leben des Orest]]'', and a seminar on "Criteria of New Music" at the Fifth International Summer Course for New Music at Kranichstein. Adorno also became increasingly involved with the publishing house of [[Peter Suhrkamp]], inducing the latter to publish Benjamin's ''Berlin Childhood Around 1900'', Kracauer's writings and a two-volume edition of Benjamin's writings. Adorno's own recently published ''Minima Moralia'' was not only well received in the press, but also met with great admiration from Thomas Mann, who wrote to Adorno from America in 1952:
{{quote|I have spent days attached to your book as if by a magnet. Every day brings new fascination ... concentrated nourishment. It is said that the companion star to Sirius, white in colour, is made of such dense material that a cubic inch of it would weigh a tonne here. This is why it has such an extremely powerful gravitational field; in this respect it is similar to your book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Yet Adorno was no less moved by other public events: protesting the publication of [[Heinrich Mann]]'s novel ''[[Professor Unrat]]'' with its film title, ''[[The Blue Angel]]''; declaring his sympathy with those who protested the scandal of big-game hunting and penning a defense of prostitutes.

====More essays on mass culture and literature====
Because Adorno's American citizenship would have been forfeited by the middle of 1952 had he continued to stay outside the country, he returned once again to [[Santa Monica]] to survey his prospects at the Hacker Foundation. While there he wrote a content analysis of [[Western astrology|newspaper horoscopes]] (now collected in ''The Stars Down to Earth''), and the essays "Television as Ideology" and "Prologue to Television"; even so, he was pleased when, at the end of ten months, he was enjoined to return as co-director of the Institute.

Back in Frankfurt, he renewed his academic duties and, from 1952 to 1954, completed three essays: "Notes on Kafka", "Valéry Proust Museum", and an essay on Schoenberg following the composer's death, all of which were included in the 1955 essay collection ''Prisms''. In response to the publication of [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[The Black Swan (Mann novella)|The Black Swan]]'', Adorno penned a long letter to the author, who then approved its publication in the literary journal ''Akzente''. A second collection of essays, ''Notes to Literature'', appeared in 1958. After meeting [[Samuel Beckett]] while delivering a series of lectures in Paris the same year, Adorno set to work on "Trying to Understand Endgame," which, along with studies of [[Proust]], [[Valéry]], and [[Balzac]], formed the central texts of the 1961 publication of the second volume of his ''Notes to Literature''. Adorno's entrance into literary discussions continued in his June 1963 lecture at the annual conference of the Hölderlin Society. At the Philosophers' Conference of October 1962 in Münster, at which Habermas wrote that Adorno was "A writer among bureaucrats", Adorno presented "Progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''Zeitschrift'' was never revived, the Institute nevertheless published a series of important sociological books, including ''Sociologica'' (1955), a collection of essays, ''Gruppenexperiment'' (1955), ''Betriebsklima'', a study of work satisfaction among workers in Mannesmann, and ''Soziologische Exkurse'', a textbook-like anthology intended as an introductory work about the discipline.

====Public figure====
Throughout the fifties and sixties, Adorno became a [[public figure]], not simply through his books and essays, but also through his appearances in radio and newspapers. In talks, interviews and round-table discussions broadcast on Hessen Radio, South-West Radio and Radio Bremen, Adorno discussed topics as diverse as "The Administered World" (September 1950), "What is the Meaning of 'Working Through the Past?"' (February 1960) to "The Teaching Profession and its Taboos" (August 1965). Additionally, he frequently wrote for ''Frankfurter Allgemeine'', ''Frankfurter Rundschau'' and the weekly ''Die Zeit''.

At the invitation of Wolfgang Steinecke, Adorno took part in the Darmstadt Summer Courses for New Music in Kranichstein from 1951 to 1958. Yet conflicts between the so-called [[Darmstadt school]], which included composers like [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Luigi Nono]], [[Bruno Maderna]], [[Karel Goeyvaerts]], [[Luciano Berio]] and [[Gottfried Michael Koenig]], soon arose, receiving explicit expression in Adorno's 1954 lecture, "The Aging of the New Music", where he argued that atonality's freedom was being restricted to serialism in much the same way as it was once restricted by twelve-tone technique. With his friend [[Eduard Steuermann]], Adorno feared that music was being sacrificed to stubborn rationalization. During this time Adorno not only produced a significant series of notes on Beethoven (which was never completed and only published posthumously), but also published ''Mahler: A Musical Physiognomy'' in 1960. In his 1961 return to Kranichstein, Adorno called for what he termed a "musique informelle", which would possess the ability "really and truly to be what it is, without the ideological pretense of being something else. Or rather, to admit frankly the fact of non-identity and to follow through its logic to the end."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-war German culture====
At the same time Adorno struck up relationships with contemporary German-language poets such as [[Paul Celan]] and [[Ingeborg Bachmann]]. Adorno's 1949 dictum—"To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric"—posed the question of what German culture could mean after Auschwitz; his own continual revision of this dictum—in ''Negative Dialectics'', for example, he wrote that "Perennial suffering has as much right to expression as a tortured man has to scream";  while in "Commitment," he wrote in 1962 that the dictum "expresses in negative form the impulse which inspires committed literature"—was part of post-war Germany's struggle with history and culture. Adorno additionally befriended the writer and poet [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]] as well as the film-maker [[Alexander Kluge]].

In 1963, Adorno was elected to the post of chairman of the German Sociological Society, where he presided over two important conferences: in 1964, on "Max Weber and Sociology" and in 1968 on "Late Capitalism or Industrial Society". A debate launched in 1961 by Adorno and [[Karl Popper]], later published as the ''[[Positivist Dispute in German Sociology]]'', arose out of disagreements at the 1959 14th German Sociology Conference in Berlin.

Adorno's critique of the dominant climate of post-war Germany was also directed against the pathos that had grown up around Heideggerianism, as practiced by writers like [[Karl Jaspers]] and [[Otto Friedrich Bollnow]], and which had subsequently seeped into public discourse. His 1964 publication of ''The Jargon of Authenticity'' took aim at the halo such writers had attached to words like "angst", "decision" and "leap". After seven years of work, Adorno completed ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' in 1966, after which, during the summer semester of 1967 and the winter semester of 1967–68, he offered regular philosophy seminars to discuss the book chapter by chapter. Among the students at these seminars were the Americans [[Angela Davis]] and Irving Wohlfarth. One objection which would soon take on ever greater importance, was that critical thought must adopt the standpoint of the oppressed, to which Adorno replied that negative dialectics was concerned "with the dissolution of standpoint thinking itself."

====Confrontations with students====
At the time of ''Negative Dialectics''{{'}} publication, the fragility of West German democracy led to increasing [[student protest]]s. Monopolistic trends in the media, an educational crisis in the universities, the Shah of Iran's 1967 state visit, German support for the war in Vietnam and the emergency laws combined to create a highly unstable situation. Like many of his students, Adorno too opposed the [[German Emergency Acts|emergency laws]], as well as the war in Vietnam, which, he said, proved the continued existence of the "world of torture that had begun in Auschwitz".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=451}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation only deteriorated with the police shooting of [[Benno Ohnesorg]] at a protest against the Shah's visit. This death, as well as the subsequent acquittal of the responsible officer, were both commented upon in Adorno's lectures. As politicization increased, rifts developed within both the Institute's relationship with its students as well as within the Institute itself. Soon Adorno himself would become an object of the students' ire. At the invitation of [[Peter Szondi]], Adorno was invited to the [[Free University of Berlin]] to give a lecture on [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris (Goethe)|Iphigenie in Tauris]]''. After a group of students marched to the lectern, unfurling a banner that read "Berlin's left-wing fascists greet Teddy the Classicist," a number of those present left the lecture in protest after Adorno refused to abandon his talk in favour of discussing his attitude on the current political situation. Adorno shortly thereafter participated in a meeting with the Berlin [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund]] (SDS) and discussed "Student Unrest" with Szondi on West German Radio. But as 1968 progressed, Adorno became increasingly critical of the students' disruptions to university life. His isolation was only compounded by articles published in the magazine ''alternative'', which, following the lead of [[Hannah Arendt]]'s articles in ''Merkur'', claimed Adorno had subjected Benjamin to pressure during his years of exile in Berlin and compiled Benjamin's ''Writings'' and ''Letters'' with a great deal of bias. In response, Benjamin's longtime friend [[Gershom Scholem]], wrote to the editor of ''Merkur'' to express his disapproval of the "in part, shameful, not to say disgraceful" remarks by Arendt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between students and the West German state continued deteriorating. In spring 1968, a prominent SDS spokesman, [[Rudi Dutschke]], was gunned down in the streets; in response, massive demonstrations took place, directed in particular against the [[Springer Press]], which had led a campaign to vilify the students. An open appeal published in ''[[Die Zeit]]'', signed by Adorno, called for an inquiry into the social reasons that gave rise to this assassination attempt as well as an investigation into the Springer Press' manipulation of public opinion. At the same time, however, Adorno protested against disruptions of his own lectures and refused to express his solidarity with their political goals, maintaining instead his autonomy as a theoretician. Adorno rejected the so-called unity of theory and praxis advocated by the students and argued that the students' actions were premised upon a mistaken analysis of the situation. The building of barricades, he wrote to Marcuse, is "ridiculous against those who administer the bomb."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1968 Adorno went to Vienna for the publication of ''Alban Berg: Master of the Smallest Link''. Upon his return to Frankfurt, events prevented his concentrating upon the book on aesthetics he wished to write: "Valid student claims and dubious actions," he wrote to Marcuse, "are all so mixed up together that all productive work and even sensible thought are scarcely possible any more."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; After striking students threatened to strip the Institute's sociology seminar rooms of their furnishings and equipment, the police were brought in to close the building.

Adorno began writing an introduction to a collection of poetry by Rudolf Borchardt, which was connected with a talk entitled "Charmed Language," delivered in Zurich, followed by a talk on aesthetics in Paris where he met Beckett again. Beginning in October 1966, Adorno took up work on ''Aesthetic Theory''.  In June 1969 he completed ''Catchwords: Critical Models''. During the winter semester of 1968–69 Adorno was on sabbatical leave from the university and thus able to dedicate himself to the completion of his book of aesthetics.

For the summer semester Adorno planned a lecture course entitled "An Introduction to Dialectical Thinking," as well as a seminar on the dialectics of subject and object. But at the first lecture Adorno's attempt to open up the lecture and invite questions whenever they arose degenerated into a disruption from which he quickly fled: after a student wrote on the blackboard "If Adorno is left in peace, capitalism will never cease," three women students approached the lectern, bared their breasts and scattered flower petals over his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Adorno continued to resist blanket condemnations of the protest movement which would have only strengthened the conservative thesis according to which political irrationalism was the result of Adorno's teaching. After further disruptions to his lectures, Adorno canceled the lectures for the rest of the seminar, continuing only with his philosophy seminar. In the summer of 1969, weary from these activities, Adorno returned once again to [[Zermatt, Switzerland]], at the foot of Matterhorn to restore his strength. On August 6 he died of a heart attack.

==Theory==
{{Frankfurt School}}
Adorno's work sets out from a central insight he shares with all early 20th century avant-garde art: the recognition of what is primitive in ourselves and the world itself. Neither [[Picasso]]'s fascination with African sculpture nor [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]'s reduction of painting to its most elementary component—the line—is comprehensible outside this concern with [[primitivism]] Adorno shared with the century's most radical art. At that time, the Western world, beset by world-wars, colonialist consolidation and accelerating [[commodification]], sank into the very barbarism civilization had prided itself in overcoming. According to Adorno, society's self-preservation had become indistinguishable from societally sanctioned self-sacrifice: of "primitive" peoples, primitive aspects of the ego and those primitive, mimetic desires found in imitation and sympathy. Adorno's theory proceeds from an understanding of this primitive quality of reality which seeks to counteract whatever aims either to repress this primitive aspect or to further those systems of domination set in place by this return to barbarism. From this perspective, Adorno's writings on politics, philosophy, music and literature are a lifelong critique of the ways in which each tries to justify self-mutilation as the necessary price of self-preservation. According to Adorno's translator Robert Hullot-Kentor, the central motive of Adorno's work thus consists in determining "how life could be more than the struggle for self-preservation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Durão|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the principle of self-preservation, Adorno writes in ''Negative Dialectics'', is nothing but "the law of doom thus far obeyed by history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|2003|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its most basic, Adorno's thought is motivated by a fundamental critique of this law.

Adorno was chiefly influenced by [[Max Weber]]'s critique of [[disenchantment]], [[Georg Lukács]]'s Hegelian interpretation of Marxism, as well as [[Walter Benjamin]]'s philosophy of history. Adorno, along with the other major Frankfurt School theorists [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]], argued that advanced capitalism had managed to contain or liquidate the forces that would bring about its collapse and that the revolutionary moment, when it would have been possible to transform it into socialism, had passed. As he put it at the beginning of his ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' (1966), philosophy is still necessary because the time to realise it was missed. Adorno argued that capitalism had become more entrenched through its attack on the objective basis of revolutionary consciousness and through liquidation of the individualism that had been the basis of critical consciousness. Adorno, as well as Horkheimer, critiqued all forms of [[positivism]] as responsible for [[technocracy]] and disenchantment and sought to produce a theory that both rejected positivism and avoided reinstating traditional [[metaphysics]]. Adorno and Horkheimer have been criticized for over-applying the term "positivism," especially in their interpretations of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]] as positivists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 242–5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===

Adorno criticized [[jazz]] and [[popular music]], viewing it as part of the [[culture industry]], that contributes to the present sustainability of capitalism by rendering it "aesthetically pleasing" and "agreeable".&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, R. 'The Uses of Pessimism: and the Danger of False Hope' 2010, p.89, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early essays for the Vienna-based journal ''Anbruch'', Adorno claimed that musical progress is proportional to the composer's ability to constructively deal with the possibilities and limitations contained within what Adorno called the "musical material." For Adorno, twelve-tone serialism constitutes a decisive, historically developed method of composition. The objective validity of composition, according to Adorno, rests with neither the composer's genius nor the work's conformity with prior standards, but with the way in which the work coherently expresses the dialectic of the material. In this sense, the contemporary absence of composers of the status of Bach or Beethoven is not the sign of musical regression; instead, new music is to be credited with laying bare aspects of the musical material previously repressed: The musical material's liberation from number, the harmonic series and tonal harmony. Thus, historical progress is achieved only by the composer who "submits to the work and seemingly does not undertake anything active except to follow where it leads." Because historical experience and social relations are embedded within this musical material, it is to the analysis of such material that the critic must turn. In the face of this radical liberation of the musical material, Adorno came to criticize those who, like Stravinsky, withdrew from this freedom by taking recourse to forms of the past as well as those who turned twelve-tone composition into a technique which dictated the rules of composition.

Adorno saw the culture industry as an arena in which critical tendencies or potentialities were eliminated. He argued that the culture industry, which produced and circulated cultural commodities through the mass media, manipulated the population. Popular culture was identified as a reason why people become passive; the easy pleasures available through consumption of popular culture made people docile and content, no matter how terrible their economic circumstances. "Capitalist production so confines them, body and soul, that they fall helpless victims to what is offered them."{{sfn|Laughey|2007|loc=123}} The differences among cultural goods make them appear different, but they are in fact just variations on the same theme. He wrote that "the same thing is offered to everybody by the standardized production of consumption goods" but this is concealed under "the manipulation of taste and the official culture's pretense of individualism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arato|Gephart|1982|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; By doing so, the culture industry appeals to every single consumer in a unique and personalized way, all while maintaining minimal costs and effort on their behalf. Consumers purchase the illusion that every commodity or product is tailored to the individual's personal preference, by incorporating subtle modifications or inexpensive "add-ons" in order to keep the consumer returning for new purchases, and therefore more revenue for the corporation system. Adorno conceptualized this phenomenon as ''pseudo-individualisation'' and the ''always-the-same''. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Adorno's analysis allowed for a critique of mass culture from the left which balanced the critique of popular culture from the right. From both perspectives—left and right—the nature of cultural production was felt to be at the root of social and moral problems resulting from the consumption of culture. However, while the critique from the right emphasized moral degeneracy ascribed to sexual and racial influences within popular culture, Adorno located the problem not with the content, but with the objective realities of the production of mass culture and its effects, e.g. as a form of [[reverse psychology]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Thinkers influenced by Adorno believe that today's society has evolved in a direction foreseen by him, especially in regard to the past ([[Auschwitz]]), morals, or the Culture Industry. The latter has become a particularly productive, yet highly contested term in [[cultural studies]]. Many of Adorno's reflections on aesthetics and music have only just begun to be debated, as a collection of essays on the subject, many of which had not previously been translated into English, has only recently been collected and published as ''Essays on Music''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adorno's work in the years before his death was shaped by the idea of "negative dialectics", set out especially in his book of that title. A key notion in the work of the Frankfurt School since ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' had been the idea of thought becoming an instrument of domination that subsumes all objects under the control of the (dominant) subject, especially through the notion of identity, i.e. of identifying as real in nature and society only that which harmonized or fit with dominant concepts, and regarding as unreal or non-existent everything that did not. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Adorno's "negative dialectics" was an attempt to articulate a non-dominating thought that would recognize its limitations and accept the non-identity and reality of that which could not be subsumed under the subject's concepts. Indeed, Adorno sought to ground the critical bite of his sociological work in his critique of identity, which he took to be a reification in thought of the commodity form or exchange relation which always presumes a false identity between different things. The potential to criticise arises from the gap between the concept and the object, which can never go into the former without remainder. This gap, this non-identity in identity, was the secret to a critique of both material life and conceptual reflection. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Adorno's reputation as a musicologist has been in steady decline since his death.  His sweeping criticisms of jazz and championing of the [[Second Viennese School]] in opposition to Stravinsky have caused him to fall out of favour.  The distinguished American scholar [[Richard Taruskin]]&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin, Richard. ''The Oxford History of Western Music''. Oxford University Press, 2005, p.xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; declared Adorno to be "preposterously over-rated." The eminent pianist and critic [[Charles Rosen]] saw Adorno's book ''The Philosophy of New Music'' as "largely a fraudulent presentation, a work of polemic that pretends to be an objective study." &lt;ref&gt;Rosen, C. (2000, p117) ''Critical Entertainments: Music Old and New''. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Even a fellow Marxist such as the historian and jazz critic [[Eric Hobsbawm]] saw Adorno's writings as containing "some of the stupidest pages ever written about jazz".&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm, Eric (1993, p. 300) ''The Jazz Scene'' . New York, Pantheon.&lt;/ref&gt; The British philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] saw Adorno as producing "reams of turgid nonsense devoted to showing that the American people are just as alienated as Marxism requires them to be, and that their cheerful life-affirming music is a ‘fetishized’ commodity, expressive of their deep spiritual enslavement to the capitalist machine." &lt;ref&gt;Scruton, R. 'The Uses of Pessimism: and the Danger of False Hope' 2010, p.89, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Irritation with Adorno's tunnel vision started even while he was alive.  He may have championed Schoenberg, but the composer notably failed to return the compliment: "I have never been able to bear the fellow [...] It is disgusting, by the way, how he treats Stravinsky." &lt;ref&gt;Letter of 5 December 1949, quoted in Stuckenschmidt, Arnold Schoenberg: His Life, World and Work, trans. H. Searle London: John Calder, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the scholar [[Slavoj Žižek]] has written a foreword to Adorno's ''In Search of Wagner'',&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor (2005). In Search of Wagner. London and New York: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt; where Žižek attributes an "emancipatory impulse" to the same book, although Žižek suggests that fidelity to this impulse demands "a betrayal of the explicit theses of Adorno's Wagner study."&lt;ref&gt;Žižek, Slavoj. (2005). Foreword: Why Is Wagner Worth Saving? In: Adorno, Theodor. (2005). In Search of Wagner. London and New York: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The five components of recognition ====
Adorno states that a start to understand the recognition in respect of any particular song hit may be made by drafting a scheme which divides the experience of recognition into its different components. All the factors people enumerate are interwoven to a degree that would be impossible to separate from one another in reality. Adorno's scheme is directed towards the different objective elements involved in the experience of recognition, than the actual experience felt for the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Popular Music|last = Adorno|first = Theodor|date = 1941|journal = Essays on Music|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist criticisms===
Adorno posits social totality as an automatic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=adorno |title=Theodor W. Adorno |last=Zuidervaart |first=Lambert}} According to Adorno, society and culture form a sociohistorical totality, such that the pursuit of freedom in society is inseparable from the pursuit of enlightenment in culture.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Horst Müller's ''Kritik der kritischen Theorie'' ("Critique of Critical Theory"), this assumption is consistent with Adorno's idea of society as a self-regulating system, from which one must escape (but from which nobody ''can'' escape). For him it was existent, but inhuman. Müller argues against the existence of such a system and claims that critical theory provides no practical solution for societal change. He concludes that [[Jürgen Habermas]], in particular, and the Frankfurt School in general, misconstrue Marx.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Standardization==
The phenomenon of standardization is "a concept used to characterize the formulaic products of capitalist-driven mass media and mass culture that appeal to the lowest common denominator in pursuit of maximum profit".{{sfn|Laughey|2007|loc=204}} According to Adorno we inhabit a media culture driven society which has product consumption as one of its main characteristics. Mass media is employed to deliver messages about products and services to consumers in order to convince these individuals to purchase the commodity they are advertising. Standardization consists of the production of large amounts of commodities to then pursue consumers in order to gain the maximum profit possible.

They do this, as mentioned above, by individualizing products to give the illusion to consumers that they are in fact purchasing a product or service that was specifically designed for them. Adorno highlights the issues created with the construction of popular music, where different samples of music used in the creation of today's chart-topping songs are put together in order to create, re-create, and modify numerous tracks by using the same variety of samples from one song to another. He makes a distinction between "Apologetic music" and "Critical music". Apologetic music is defined as the highly produced and promoted music of the "pop music" industry: music that is composed of variable parts and interchanged to create several different songs. "The social and psychological functions of popular music [are that it] acts like a social cement"{{sfn|Adorno|1990|loc={{Page needed|date=April 2015}}}} "to keep people obedient and subservient to the status quo of existing power structures."{{sfn|Laughey|2007|loc=125}}

Serious music, according to Adorno, achieves excellence when its whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The example he gives is that of Beethoven's symphonies: "[his] greatness shows itself in the complete subordination of the accidentally private melodic elements to the form as a whole."{{sfn|Laughey|2010|loc=125}}{{incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}

Standardization not only refers to the products of the culture industry but to the consumers as well: many times every day consumers are bombarded by media advertising. Consumers are pushed and shoved into consuming products and services presented to them by the media system. The masses have become conditioned by the culture industry, which makes the impact of standardization much more important. By not realizing the impact of social media and commercial advertising, the individual is caught in a situation where conformity is the norm. "During consumption the masses become characterized by the commodities which they use and exchange among themselves."{{sfn|Laughey|2007|loc=124}}

===Adorno's responses to his critics===
As a pioneer of a self-reflexive sociology who prefigured [[Bourdieu]]'s ability to factor in the effect of reflection on the societal object, Adorno realized that some criticism (including deliberate disruption of his classes in the 1960s) could never be answered in a dialogue between equals if, as he seems to have believed, what the naive ethnographer or sociologist thinks of a human essence is always changing over time.&lt;ref&gt;For a comparison of Adorno's and Bourdieu's rather divergent conceptions of reflexivity, see: Karakayali, Nedim. [http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/38/2/351 2004. "Reading Bourdieu with Adorno: The Limits of Critical Theory and Reflexive Sociology," ''Sociology'' (Journal of the British Sociological Association), '''38'''(2), pp. 351–368.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ffm-adorno-ampel001.jpg|thumb|276px|right|The "Adorno-Ampel" (Adorno-traffic light) on Senckenberganlage, a street which divides the Institute for Social Research from [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]—Adorno requested its construction after a pedestrian death in 1962, and it was finally installed 25 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rezensionen.ch/buchbesprechungen/frank-berger-christian-setzepfandt-101-unorte-in-frankfurt/3797312482.html|title=Frankfurt gnadenlos entdecken|accessdate=2012-12-16|author1=Berger, Frank |author2=Setzepfandt, Christian |date=2011-05-07|publisher=''[[Rezensionen]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Adorno's sociological methods==

As Adorno believed that sociology needs to be self-reflective and self-critical, he also believed that the language the sociologist uses, like the language of the ordinary person, is a political construct in large measure that uses, often unreflectingly, concepts installed by dominant classes and social structures (such as our notion of "deviance" which includes both genuinely deviant individuals and "hustlers" operating below social norms because they lack the capital to operate above: for an analysis of this phenomenon, cf. [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s book ''The Weight of the World''). He felt that those at the top of the Institute needed to be the source primarily of theories for evaluation and empirical testing, as well as people who would process the "facts" discovered...including revising theories that were found to be false. For example, in an essay published in Germany on Adorno's return from the USA, and reprinted in the ''Critical Models'' essays collection ({{ISBN|0-231-07635-5}}), Adorno praised the [[egalitarianism]] and openness of US society  based on his sojourn in New York and the Los Angeles area between 1935 and 1955: "Characteristic for the life in America [...]is a moment of peacefulness, kindness and generosity". ("Dem amerikanischen Leben eignet [...] ein Moment von Friedlichkeit, Gutartigkeit und Großzügigkeit".)&lt;ref&gt;Theodor W. Adorno, ''Stichworte. Kritische Modelle 2'', 2nd edition. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1969, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of the clash of intellectual culture and Adorno's methods can be found in [[Paul Lazarsfeld]], the American sociologist for whom Adorno worked in the late 1930s after fleeing Hitler. As Rolf Wiggershaus recounts in ''The Frankfurt School, Its History, Theories and Political Significance'' (MIT 1995), Lazarsfeld was the director of a project, funded and inspired by David Sarnoff (the head of [[RCA]]), to discover both the sort of music that listeners of radio liked and ways to improve their "taste", so that RCA could profitably air more classical music. Lazarsfeld, however, had trouble both with the prose style of the work Adorno handed in and what Lazarsfeld thought was Adorno's "lack of discipline in ... presentation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wiggershaus|1995|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adorno himself provided the following personal anecdote:

{{Quotation|What I mean by reified consciousness, I can illustrate—without elaborate philosophical contemplation—most simply with an American experience. Among the frequently changing colleagues which the Princeton Project provided me with, was a young lady. After a few days, she had gained confidence in me, and asked most kindly: "Dr Adorno, would you mind a personal question?". I said, "It depends on the question, but just go ahead", and she went on: "Please tell me: are you an extrovert or an introvert?". It was as if she, as a living being, already thought according to the model of multi-choice questions in questionnaires.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor W. Adorno, ''Stichworte. Kritische Modelle'', 2nd edition. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1969, p. 122 (also cited in Friedemann Grenz, ''Adornos Philosophie in Grundbegriffen. Auflösung einiger Deutungsprobleme''. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1974, p. 43.).&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Adorno translated into English==
While even German readers can find Adorno's work difficult to understand, an additional problem for English readers is that his German idiom is particularly difficult to translate into English. A similar difficulty of translation is true of [[Hegel]], [[Heidegger]], and a number of other German philosophers and poets. As a result, some early translators tended toward over-literalness. In recent years, [[Edmund Jephcott]] and [[Stanford University Press]] have published new translations of some of Adorno's lectures and books, including ''Introduction to Sociology'', ''Problems of Moral Philosophy'' and his transcribed lectures on Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and Aristotle's "Metaphysics", and a new translation of the ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]''. Professor Henry Pickford, of the University of Colorado at Boulder, has translated many of Adorno's works such as "The Meaning of Working Through the Past." A new translation has also appeared of ''[[Aesthetic Theory]]'' and the ''Philosophy of New Music'' by [[Robert Hullot-Kentor]], from the [[University of Minnesota Press]]. Hullot-Kentor is also currently working on a new translation of ''Negative Dialectics''. Adorno's correspondence with Alban Berg, ''Towards a Theory of Musical Reproduction'', and the letters to Adorno's parents, have been translated by [[Wieland Hoban]] and published by [[Polity Press]]. These fresh translations are slightly less literal in their rendering of German sentences and words, and are more accessible to English readers. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}}  The Group Experiment, which had been unavailable to English readers, is now available in an accessible translation by Jeffrey K. Olick and Andrew J. Perrin on Harvard University Press, along with introductory material explaining its relation to the rest of Adorno's work and 20th-century public opinion research.

'''Vacuum engineering''' deals with technological processes and equipment that use [[vacuum]] to achieve better results than those run under atmospheric [[pressure]]. The most widespread applications of vacuum technology are:
* [[Pyrolytic chromium carbide coating]]
* [[Antireflecting]] glass
* [[Glass colouring]]
* [[Vacuum impregnation]]
* [[Vacuum coating]]
* [[Vacuum drying]]

[[Vacuum coaters]] are capable of applying various types of coatings on [[metal]], [[glass]], [[plastic]] or [[ceramic]] surfaces, providing high quality and uniform thickness and color. [[Vacuum dryers]] can be used for delicate materials and save significant quantities of energy due to lower drying temperatures.

==Design and mechanism==
Vacuum systems usually consist of gauges, vapor jet and pumps, vapor traps and valves along with other extensional piping’s.  A vessel that is operating under vacuum system may be any of these types such as processing tank, steam simulator, particle accelerator, or any other type of space that has an enclosed chamber to maintain the system in less than atmospheric gas pressure.  Since a [[vacuum]] is created in an enclosed chamber, the consideration of being able to withstand external [[atmospheric pressure]] are the usual precaution for this type of design.  Along with the effect of buckling or collapsing, the outer shell of vacuum chamber will be carefully evaluated and any sign of deterioration will be corrected by the increase of thickness of the shell itself.The main material used for vacuum design are usually mild steel, stainless steel, and aluminum.Other sections such as glass are used for gauge glass or view ports or sometimes electrical insulation. The interior of [[vacuum chamber]] should always be smooth and free of rush and defections.
High pressure solvent are usually used to remove any excess oil and contaminants that will affect vacuum in any way.Due to [[vacuum chamber]] is in an enclosed space, very specific detergents can be used to prevent any hazards or danger during cleaning. Any [[vacuum chamber]] should always have a certain number of access and viewing ports.  These are usually served as a flange connection to the attachment of pumps, piping or any other parts required for system operation.  The most importance is the fabrication of vacuum chambers sealing capability.The chamber itself must be airtight to maintain perfect vacuum, this is ensure through the process of leaking hunting generally using mass [[spectrometer]] leak detector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vacuum Science and Engineering|last=Atta|first=C.M. Van|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1965|isbn=|location=New York|pages=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All openings and connections are also assembled with O rings and gaskets to prevent any further possible leakage of air in the system.

==Technology==
{{more citations needed|date=October 2017}}
Vacuum engineering uses techniques and equipment that vary greatly depending on the level of vacuum used. Pressure slightly reduced from atmospheric pressure may be used to control airflow in ventilation systems, or in material handling systems. Lower-pressure vacuums may be used in vacuum evaporation in processing of food stuffs without excessive heating. Higher grades of vacuum are used for degassing, vacuum metallurgy, and in the production of light bulbs and cathode ray tubes. So-called "ultrahigh" vacuums are required for certain semiconductor processing; the "hardest" vacuums with the lowest pressure are produced for experiments in physics, where even a few stray atoms of air would interfere with the experiment in progress.

Apparatus used varies with decreasing pressure. Blowers give way to various kinds of reciprocating and rotary pumps. For some important applications, a [[steam ejector]] can quickly evacuate a large process vessel to a rough vacuum, sufficient for some processes or as a preliminary to more complete pumping processes. The invention of the [[Sprengel pump]] was a critical step in the development of the incandescent light bulb as it allowed creation of a vacuum that was higher than previously available, which extended the life of the bulbs. At higher vacuum levels (lower pressures), diffusion pumps, absorption, cyrogenic pumps are used. Pumps are more like "compressors" since they gather the rarefied gases in the vacuum vessel and push them into a much higher pressure, smaller volume, exhaust. A chain of two or more different kinds of vacuum pumps may be used in a vacuum system, with one "roughing" pump removing most of the mass of air from the system, and the additional stages handling relatively smaller amounts of air at lower and lower pressures. In some applications, a chemical element is used to combine with the air remaining in an enclosure after pumping. For example, in electronic [[vacuum tube]]s, a metallic "getter" was heated by induction to remove the air left after initial pump down and closure of the tubes. The "getter" would also slowly remove any gas evolved within the tube during its remaining life, maintaining sufficiently good vacuum.

==Applications==
Vacuum technology is a method used to evacuate air from a closed volume by creating a pressure differential from the closed volume to some vent, the ultimate vent being the open atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vacuum Technology|last=|first=|publisher=Hydraulics &amp; Pneumatics|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=83–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; When using an industrial vacuum system, a vacuum pump or generator creates this pressure differential. A variety of technical inventions were created based on the idea of vacuum discovered during the 17th century. These range from vacuum generation pumps to X-ray tubes, which were later introduced to the medical field for use as sources of [[X-ray | X-ray radiation]]. The vacuum environment has come to play an important role in scientific research as new discoveries are being made by looking back to the basic fundamentals of pressure. The idea of “perfect vacuum” cannot be realized, but very nearly approximated by the technological discoveries of the early 20th century. Vacuum engineering today uses a range of different material, from aluminum to zirconium and just about everything in between. There may be the popular belief that vacuum technology deals only with valves, flanges, and other vacuum components, but novel scientific discoveries are often made with the assistance of these traditional vacuum technologies, especially in the realm of high-tech. Vacuum engineering is used for [[List of semiconductor materials#Compound semiconductors|compound semiconductors]], power devices, memory logic, and [[photovoltaics]].

Another technical invention is the vacuum pump. Such invention is used to remove gas molecules from sealed volume thus leaving behind a partial vacuum. More than one vacuum pumps are used in a single application to create fluent flow. Fluent flow is used to allow a clear path made using vacuum to remove any air molecules in the way of the process. Vacuum will be used in this process to attempted to create a perfect vacuum. A type of vacuum such as partial vacuum can be caused by the usage of [[positive displacement pump|positive displacement]] type pumps. A positive displacement pump is able to transfer gas load from the entrance to the exit port, but due to its limitation of design it can only achieve a relatively low vacuum. In order to reach a higher vacuum, other techniques must be used. By using a series of pump such as following up a fast pump down with a positive displacement type pump will create a way better vacuum than using a single pump. These combination of pump used is usually determined by the need of vacuum in the system.

[[Materials for use in vacuum]] systems must be carefully evaluated. Many materials have a degree of porosity, unimportant at ordinary pressures, but which would continually admit minute amounts of air into a vacuum system if incorrectly used. Some items, such as rubber and plastic, [[outgassing|give off gases into a vacuum]] that can contaminate the system. At high and ultrahigh vacuum levels, even metals must be carefully selected - air molecules and moisture can cling to the surface of metals, and any trapped gas within the metal may percolate to the surface under vacuum. In some vacuum systems, a simple coating of low-volatile grease is sufficient to seal gaps in joints, but at ultrahigh vacuum, fittings must be carefully machined and polished to minimize trapped gas. It is usual practice to bake components of a high-vacuum system; at high temperatures, any gases or moisture adhering to the surface is driven off. However, this requirement affects which materials can be used.

[[Particle accelerator]]s are the largest ultrahigh vacuum systems and can be up to kilometres in length.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Jousten (ed),C. Benjamin Nakhosteen (transl.),  ''Handbook of Vacuum Technology'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2016 {{ISBN|3527688242}}, chapters 1, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word “Vacuum” is originated from the Latin word “vacua”, which is translated to the word “empty”.Physicist use vacuum to describe a partially empty space, where air or some other  gases are being removed from one container. The idea of vacuum relating to the empty space has been speculated as early as 5th century from Greek philosophers, [[Aristotle]] (384-322 B.C.) was the one who came up with the relation of vacuum being an empty space in nature would be impossible to ever create.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7018/85d89b6a00275ba0cb627f54b5db326011f4.pdf .]&lt;/ref&gt; This idea had stuck around for over centuries until the 17th century, when vacuum technology and physics was discovered. In the mid 17th century, [[Evangelista Torricelli]] studied the properties of a vacuum generated by a mercury column in a glass tube; this became the [[barometer]], an instrument to observe variations in atmospheric air pressure.  [[Otto von Guericke]] spectacularly demonstrated the effect of atmospheric pressure in 1654, when teams of horses could not separate two 20-inch diameter hemispheres, which had been placed together and evacuated. In 1698, [[Thomas Savery]] patented a steam pump that relied on condensation of steam to produce a low-grade vacuum, for pumping water out of mines. The apparatus was improved in the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine]] of 1712; while inefficient, it allowed coal mines to be exploited that otherwise would flood by ground water. During the years of 1564-1642, the famous scientist [[Galileo]] was one of the first physicist to conduct experiments to develop measured forces to develop vacuum using a piston in a cylinder.This was a big discovery for scientist and was shared among others. French scientist and philosopher [[Blaise Pascal]] used the idea that was discovered to look into further research of vacuum. Pascal discoveries were similar to Torricelli’s research as Pascal used similar methods to pull vacuum using mercury. It was until the year 1661, when the mayor of the city of [[Magdeburg]] used this discovery to invent or retrofit new ideas. The mayor Otto von Guericke created the first air pump, modified the idea of water pumps, and also modified manometers.Vacuum engineering today, provides the solution for all thin film needs in the mechanical industry. This method of engineering is typically used for R&amp;D needs or large scale material production.

[[Atmospheric railway|Vacuum was used to propel trains]] experimentally.

Pump technology hit a plateau until [[Heinrich Geissler|Geissler]]  and [[Sprengel pump|Sprengle]] in the mid 19th century, who finally gave access to the high-vacuum regime. This led to the study of electrical discharges in vacuum, discovery of cathode rays,discovery of X-rays and the discovery of the electron. The photoelectric effect was observed in high vacuum, which was a key discovery that lead to the formulation of quantum mechanics and much of modern physics.

"Virtual Design and Construction BIMs are [[Virtuality|virtual]] because they show [[Computer-based assessment|computer-based]] descriptions of the project. The BIM project model emphasizes those aspects of the project that can be designed and managed, i.e., the ''[[Product (business)|product]]'' (typically a [[building]] or [[Factory|plant]] [and infrastructure]), the ''[[organization]]'' that will define, [[design]], [[construction|construct]] and [[operate]] it, and the ''[[Business process|process]]'' that the organization teams will follow, or POP {{Definition needed|date=March 2018}}. These models are [[logically]] integrated in the sense that they all can access [[Concurrent data structure|shared data]], and if a user highlights or changes an aspect of one, the integrated models can highlight or change the dependent aspects of related models. The models are [[multi-disciplinary]] in the sense that they represent the [[Architect]], [[Engineering]], [[Construction]] (AEC) and [[Owner]] of the project, as well as relevant sub-disciplines. The models are [[Performance test (assessment)|performance models]] in the sense that they predict some aspects of project performance, track many that are relevant, and can show predicted and measured performance in relationship to stated project performance objectives. Some companies now practice the first steps of BIM modeling, and they consistently find that they improve business performance by doing so."&lt;ref&gt;John Kunz &amp; Martin Fischer  "Virtual Design and Construction: Themes, Case Studies and Implementation Suggestions" Stanford University CIFE Working Paper # 97, October 2009. [http://cife.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/WP097_0.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Companies are also now considering developing BIMs in various levels of detail, since depending on the application of BIM, more or less detail is needed, and there is varying modeling effort associated with generating building information models at different levels of detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.autcon.2010.11.027 |title=Analysis of modeling effort and impact of different levels of detail in building information models |year=2011 |last1=Leite |first1=F |last2=Akcamete |first2=A |last3=Akinci |first3=B |last4=Atasoy |first4=G |last5=Kiziltas |first5=S |journal=Automation in Construction |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=601–609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodologies Underpinning VDC ==
Advancements in construction engineering began with the ten volumes on architecture completed by [[Vitruvius]], a 1 century B.C. Roman. Vitruvi laid the foundation for the study of construction.

A principle of construction is the use of an [[Applied ontology]] based in an [[Upper ontology (information science)|Upper ontology]]. In practice these ontologies take on the form of breakdown structures such as the [[Work breakdown structure]]. Usually these breakdown structures form [[Metadata]] to represent a construction activity. In practice, this requires a [[Semantic integration]] approach to construction data so to capture the project status.

The research that formed VDC is based in [[Scientific evidence]]. This was a departure from earlier construction engineering that focused on studies of best practices. This required formulating a [[Hypothesis]] and then testing to validate. A range of methodologies have proven useful in construction engineering research, both [[Qualitative research]] and [[Quantitative research]]. Because construction is difficult to replicate in a controlled setting, the [[Case-based reasoning]] || [[Case study]] and [[Action research]] methodologies prevail. These methodologies have different [[Power of a method]], where the case study is often broad and the action research focused.

A core concept of VDC is the [[Spacetime]]. There are four dimensions, these three space dimensions and then a fourth: time. There are additional dimensions of cost and quality, but the core are these four. These four dimensions in design were first understood by Vitruvi as the importance of perspective and time. Prior to the use of computing, the focus was on the fourth dimension time. In practice, this is the [[Critical path method]]. With advances in computing, the representation of the three dimensions of space has increased. The merging of space and the above discussed ontology formed the  [[Information model]], in the construction engineering field, known as [[Building Information Modeling]]. The combination of space and time in practice is shown by the [[Linear scheduling method]] and in close relation the 4D model.

Computing brought about the advent of the need to align with a software developer. Previously, pencil and paper was forgiving on the mixing of methods from different schools of thought. Software is not as forgiving and to mix software requires this as a goal. This forms the field of [[Interoperability]] research. The practical application is demonstrated by the [[Industry Foundation Classes]].

Today, the most compelling advances in VDC are in computer vision ([[List of computer vision topics]]) and the architecture of transmission (AoT), an object-oriented project lifecycle management process, which acts as a counterpoint to commissioned IoT technologies. [http://cife.stanford.edu/]

An important application of VDC is in the workzone. This is where the construction activities reside, and the workforce is a core component. To create an educated workforce with the technical knowhow to use the technology tools now available, VDC includes the development of advanced [[Vocational education]] topics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3425">The '''Wiesbaden manifesto''' is a document written and signed by members of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives]] (MFAA) organization rejecting the plundering and removal of cultural items as spoils of war. The Allies created special commissions, such as the MFAA, to help protect famous European monuments from destruction, and after the war, to travel to territories previously occupied by the Germans to find Nazi art repositories. The allies found these plundered artworks in over 1,050 repositories in Germany and [[Austria]] at the end of [[World War II]]. The book ''The Safekeepers: Memoir of the Arts at the End of World War II'' by former [[Walter Farmer|Capt. Walter I. Farmer]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] during World War II, chronicles the recovery of and restitution of discovered hidden loot of the [[Nazi plunder]], that were stolen from museums, private collections and libraries and individual [[Jewish]] emigrants and [[death camp]] prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;The Safekeepers: A Memoir of the Arts at the End of World War II By Walter Ings Farmer, Klaus Goldmann Published by Walter de Gruyter, 2000 {{ISBN|978-3-11-016897-6}}, 242 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 1945, Capt. Walter Farmer became the collecting point's first director. The first shipment of artworks arriving at Wiesbaden included cases of antiquities, Egyptian art, Islamic artifacts, and paintings from the [[Kaiser Friedrich Museum]]. The collecting point also received materials from the [[Reichsbank]] and [[Nazi]] looted [[Poles|Polish]] liturgical collections. At its height, Wiesbaden stored, identified, and restituted approximately 700,000 individual objects, including paintings and sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=10388&lt;/ref&gt; The collecting point not only cataloged and restitutued items, but also kept them away from the [[Soviet Army]] and wartime reparations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=10388&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Opritsa D.

Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2003. xvi + 265 pp. $58.00 (cloth), {{ISBN|978-3-11-017730-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When his superiors ordered that he send to the U.S. 202 German-owned paintings in his custody, Capt. Farmer and 35 others who were in charge of the Wiesbaden collection point gathered to draw up what has become known as the Wiesbaden Manifesto on November 7, 1945, declaring "We wish to state that, from our own knowledge, no historical grievance will rankle so long or be the cause of so much justified bitterness as the removal for any reason of a part of the heritage of any nation even if that heritage may be interpreted as a prize of war." Among the co-signers was Lieutenant [[Charles Percy Parkhurst]] of the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Walter I. Farmer. The Safekeepers: A Memoir of the Arts at the End of World War II. Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 2000. x + 242 pp., {{ISBN|978-3-11-016897-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three years of debate, U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] ordered that the paintings be returned to Germany in 1948.

This model admits finite-rate chemical reactions and thus the process of detonation consists of the following stages. First, an [[infinitesimal]]ly thin shock wave compresses the explosive to a high pressure called the '''von Neumann spike'''. At the von Neumann spike point the explosive still remains unreacted. The spike marks the onset of the zone of exothermic chemical reaction, which finishes at the [[Chapman-Jouguet state]]. After that, the detonation products expand backward.

In the reference frame in which the shock is stationary, the flow following the shock is [[Speed of sound|subsonic]].  Because of this, energy release behind the shock is able to be transported acoustically to the shock for its support.  For a self-propagating detonation, the shock relaxes to a speed given by the [[Chapman–Jouguet condition]], which induces the material at the end of the reaction zone to have a locally sonic speed in the reference frame in which the shock is stationary.  In effect, all of the chemical energy is harnessed to propagate the shock wave forward.

However, in the 1960s, experiments revealed that gas-phase detonations were most often characterized by unsteady, three-dimensional structures, which can only in an averaged sense be predicted by one-dimensional steady theories. Indeed, such waves are quenched as their structure is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Edwards, D.H. |author2=Thomas, G.O. |author3=Nettleton, M.A. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Diffraction of a Planar Detonation Wave at an Abrupt Area Change|journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics|volume= 95|issue=1|pages =79–96|year= 1979|doi=10.1017/S002211207900135X|bibcode = 1979JFM....95...79E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2514/5.9781600865497.0341.0357 |volume=75 |journal=Progress in Astronautics &amp; Aeronautics|year=1981|title=Diffraction of a Planar Detonation in Various Fuel-Oxygen Mixtures at an Area Change|isbn=978-0-915928-46-0|pages=341|editors=A.

Established on 1 August 2007, Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK) resulted from the merger between the [[Hochschule für Gestaltung und Kunst Zürich]] (HGKZ), which had arisen from the [[Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich]] (founded in 1878), and the School of Music, Drama, and Dance (HMT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zurich University of the Arts Universities Handbook |url=http://www.universitieshandbook.com/directory/canton-zurich/zurich-university-of-the-arts |work= universitieshandbook.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501144050/http://www.universitieshandbook.com/directory/canton-zurich/zurich-university-of-the-arts |archivedate=May 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding president of the new arts university was Professor Hans-Peter Schwarz. Since November 2009, Professor Thomas D. Meier has been president of ZHdK.

The Hochschule für Gestaltung und Kunst Zürich (HGKZ) arose from the [[Kunstgewerbeschule]] Zürich (founded in 1878). It was located in a building constructed by architects Adolf Steger and Karl Egender, which today also houses the [[Museum of Design, Zurich]].

The School of Music, Drama, and Dance (HMT) was the result of a merger in 1999 between Winterthur and Zurich conservatories of music, Zurich’s Jazz School, Zurich’s Theatre and Acting Academy, and the Swiss Professional Ballet School. ZHdK’s programme in Theatre Studies (affiliated to the Department of Performing Arts and Film) was originally established in 1937, in the context of the [[Schauspielhaus Zürich]] (the city’s principal theatre), and known as the  Bühnenstudio Zürich. It was renamed Schauspiel-Akademie Zürich in the early 1970s.

Following the 2007 school merger, ZHdK occupies 35 sites, spread across the cities of Zurich (Ausstellungsstrasse, Florhof, Mediacampus, Gessnerallee) and Winterthur. In the autumn of 2014, ZHdK will be relocating to its new campus: the Toni Areal (under construction) in the city’s thriving western district ([[Zurich West]]). With the exception of its Gessnerallee annex, ZHdK will be leaving all other sites to unite the arts under one roof. The [[Museum of Design, Zurich]] and the Bellerive Museum will remain at their current locations.

== Teaching and research ==
ZHdK offers taught Bachelor’s and master's degree courses, which have replaced the former diploma courses in the wake of the [[Bologna Process]]. Places on all degree courses are limited. The university also offers a foundation course in art and design and various further educating courses, leading either to a Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) or a Master of Advanced Studies (MAS).

With research becoming more firmly established at universities of applied sciences, ZHdK has significantly intensified its research activities. Its seven research institutes and two centres of excellence focus on artistic research in particular. Research is also undertaken in the fields of [[design]], [[art history]], art education, and [[musicology]]. And, ZhdK is also running several joint PhD programmes in cooperation with national and international universities.
