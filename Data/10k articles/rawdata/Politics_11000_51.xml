The [[People's Republic of Albania]] executed 22 [[intellectuals]] without trial on 26 February 1951, as ordered by [[Enver Hoxha]]. They were accused of bombing the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] embassy in Tirana. The victims were 21 males and one female. One day earlier, [[Jonuz Kaceli]] was killed while accused of the same crime. It was the first time the [[Agitation and Propaganda against the State|Agitation and Propaganda law]] was used.

==Background==
===Arrests===
The 22 individuals were arrested and put in prison between 20 and 22 February 1951, then [[executed by firing squad]] on 26 February. The pretext was the explosion of a small amount of dynamite in the Soviet Embassy in Tirana on 19 February, for which the arrested persons were accused of.&lt;ref name="zemrashqiptare1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zemrashqiptare.net/article/Historia/7046/ |title=Uran Butka: Masakra e 1951, Prokurori dhe Gjyqtari: I pushkatuam pa gjyq 22 vetë |publisher=Zemra Shqiptare |date=27 February 2009 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radiovaticana.org/ALB/Articolo.asp?c=360125 |title=Shqipëri: 26 shkurt 1951 regjimi komunist ekzekuton 22 intelektualë shqiptarë |publisher=Radiovaticana.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-29 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 February, the Communist leadership assembled and decided on counter-measures. Present were [[Enver Hoxha]], [[Tuk Jakova]], [[Mehmet Shehu]], [[Bedri Spahiu]], [[Hysni Kapo]], [[Gogo Nushi]], [[Spiro Koleka]], [[Beqir Balluku]] and [[Liri Belishova]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazeta55.net/gazeta/18.05.2009.pdf], [[Gazeta 55]], p. 13{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrests were made based on death lists prepared in advance by the Ministry of Interior. The charge, as prepared and signed by Military Prosecutor [[Siri Çarçani]] and dated 25 February 1951, was the same for all 22 victims and read:

{{quote|text=These people have been put at the service of imperialist foreign espionage, they have become members of a terrorist organization. They have made propaganda about the violent collapse of the people's power and have distributed slogans for a new war from the American and British imperialists and their satellites.|sign=[[Siri Çarçani]]|source=Military Prosecutor of [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|communist Albania]]}}

The same Çarçani admitted later that when he wrote the charge he was completely unaware of any investigation having ever been performed. In addition, the charge was never communicated to any of the victims. Furthermore, a trial was never held.

==Execution==

One of the arrested intellectuals, [[Jonuz Kaceli]], was killed a day earlier (25 February), by [[Mehmet Shehu]] after Kaceli punched and injured Shehu in the face after a long interrogation on [[high treason]] accusations by Shehu and [[Rasim Dedja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://arkivi.peshkupauje.com/2009/02/masakra-e-1951-prokurori-dhe-gjyqtari-i.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209122914/http://arkivi.peshkupauje.com/2009/02/masakra-e-1951-prokurori-dhe-gjyqtari-i.html |archive-date=9 February 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaceli was thrown out of a window, head-first from the second floor, in the pretense that he had committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zemrashqiptare.net/article/Komente/4583/ |title=Pushkatimet e të dënuarve të bombës sovjetike në shkelje me ligjet |publisher=Zemra Shqiptare |date=31 August 2008 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 22 victims were executed on 26 February 1951, six days after the first arrest was made. All of the victims were shot based on a government decree issued by the Ministry of the Interior on the same day of the killings. The Minister of Interior that issued the decree was [[Omer Nishani]]. [[Manol Konomi]], at the time minister of justice, did not want to sign the death sentences without approval. They were executed at midnight, near the Beshiri bridge, 15&amp;nbsp;km from [[Tirana]], and were buried in a common grave, bound together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://storico.radiovaticana.org/alb/storico/2010-02/360125_shqiperi_26_shkurt_1951_regjimi_komunist_ekzekuton_22_intelektuale_shqiptare.html Shqipëri: 26 shkurt 1951 regjimi komunist ekzekuton 22 intelektualë shqiptarë]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February 1951 the other victims were shot by an execution squad. The head of the police during that time, [[Sali Ormëni]], was killed one week after the bombing. On 5 March 1951 the executions were approved by the military court of [[Communist Albania]]; that is eight days after the suspects were executed.

==Aftermath and legacy==
It was later found out that the bombing was actually orchestrated by Hysen Llulla and Qazim Laçi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazeta55.net/gazeta/18.05.2009.pdf]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Gazeta 55]], p.13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 all victims were declared innocent,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kygUAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA2 Daily report: East Europe, Nummers 152-161], Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; and posthumously awarded the order ''Honor of the State'' by president [[Bamir Topi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvklan.al/lajmi.php?id=15452 |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724190345/http://www.tvklan.al/lajmi.php?id=15452 |archive-date=24 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their bodies were found bound with barbed wire in a joint mass grave on the [[Erzen]] river edge.{{when|date=November 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6759">[[File:CDAA Elmendorf AFB.PNG|thumb|AN/FLR-9 in Elmendorf, Alaska, date unknown.]]
The '''AN/FLR-9''' is a type of very large circular "[[Wullenweber]]" [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] array, built at eight locations during the [[cold war]] for [[HF/DF]] [[direction finding]] of high priority targets. The worldwide network, known collectively as "Iron Horse", could locate [[High Frequency|HF]] communications almost anywhere on the planet. Because of the exceptionally large size of its outer reflecting screen (1056 vertical steel wires supported by 96 120-foot towers), the [[Joint Electronics Type Designation System|FLR]]-9 was commonly referred to by the nickname "Elephant Cage." Constructed in the early to mid 1960s, in May 2016 the last operational FLR-9 at Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska was decommissioned.&lt;ref name="Bowman, 2016" /&gt; It can be confused with the US Navy's [[AN/FRD-10]], which also used a Wullenweber antenna.

== Description ==

The ''AN/FLR-9 Operation and Service Manual''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premium-rx.org/ref/wullenweber.pdf AN/FLR-9 Operation and Service manual]&lt;/ref&gt; describes the array as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The antenna array is composed of three concentric rings of antenna elements. Each ring of elements receives RF signals for an assigned portion of the 1.5 to 30-MHz radio spectrum. The outer ring normally covers the 2 to 6-MHz range (band A), but also provides reduced coverage down to 1.5 MHz. The center ring covers the 6 to 18-MHz range (band B) and the inner ring covers the 18 to 30-MHz range (band C). Band A contains 48 sleeve monopole elements spaced 78.4 feet apart (7.5 degrees). Band B contains 96 sleeve monopole elements spaced 37.5 feet (11.43 m) apart (3.75 degrees). Band C contains 48 antenna elements mounted on wooden structures placed in a circle around the central building. Bands A and B elements are vertically polarized. Band C elements consist of two horizontally polarized dipole antenna subelements electrically tied together, and positioned one above the other.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The array is centered on a ground screen 1,443 feet (439.8 m) in diameter. The arrangement permits accurate [[direction finding]] of signals from up to 4000 nautical miles (7408&amp;nbsp;km) away.

* [[San Vito dei Normanni Air Station]], [[Italy]] (near [[Brindisi]], Italy)

Advances in technology have made the FLR-9 obsolete. In 1997, the FLR-9 at the former Clark AB in the Philippines was converted into a [[Expo Pilipino|35,000-seat fabric-covered amphitheatre]]. In early May 2002, systematic dismantling of the FLR-9 at San Vito began, and it was totally deconstructed by the end of that month.  Although the markings of where the array stood remain in the ground, the structure is completely gone.&lt;ref&gt;http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/former-an-flr-9-site-hfdf-in-italy/view/?service=0&lt;/ref&gt;

Demolition of the FLR-9 at Misawa began in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kyodo News]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20121008a9.html 'Elephant Cage' antennas to be axed]", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 8 October 2012, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

A decommissioning ceremony for the last active FLR-9, at [[Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson]], was held on May 25, 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18956">The '''All-African Peoples{{'}} Conference''' (AAPC) was partly a corollary and partly a different perspective to the modern Africa states represented by the Conference of Heads of independent Africa States. The All-Africa Peoples Conference was conceived to include social groups, including ethnic communities and anti-colonial political parties and African organizations such as Labor Unions and other significant associations in the late 1950s and early 1960s both in Africa and the Diaspora such as Europe, North America and South America. The All-Africa Peoples Conference was conceived to represent the position that Africa should be returned to the peoples and groups, such as ethnic communities, from who it was grabbed by colonialism. The idea was mooted in Accra April 1958 by John Kale from Uganda. This was at the end of first Africa Heads of State Conference in Accra Ghana in March 1958. John Kale then operating from exile in Egypt, who was one of the organizers of the first Africa Heads of State Conference, was already the initiating secretary (and later Chairman) of the African Liberation Committee, the Africa Executive of Afro-Asian Solidarity which had its secretariat in Cairo and shortly after the Africa representative on the World Peace Council on which he was the Vice President. For John Kale the main reason of the parallel organization to the then just concluded independent Africa Heads of States was that it had brought together only nine then independent Africa states excluding the majority of the Africa peoples both in the non-independent countries and in the Diaspora.             
The First All-Africa Peoples Conference was attended by delegates from [[National liberation movements|independence movements]] in areas still under European [[Colonialism|colonial rule]], as well as by delegates from the independent African countries, including representatives of the governing parties of some of those countries. In the Conference's own words, it was open to "all national political parties and national trade union congresses or equivalent bodies or organizations that subscribe to the aims and objects of the conference."&lt;ref&gt;AAPC amended Constitution, Article III. See Gott, Major and Warner, p, 349.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Conference met three times: December 1958, January 1960, and March 1961; and had a permanent secretariat
with headquarters in [[Accra]]. Its primary objectives were independence for the colonies; and strengthening of the independent states and resistance to [[neocolonialism]]. It tended to be more outspoken in its denunciations of colonialism than the [[Conference of Independent African States]], a contemporary organisation which, being composed of heads of state, was relatively constrained by diplomatic caution. [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] says that the All-African Peoples' Conference was the "true successor to the [[Pan-African Congress]]es." The subject matter and attitudes of the Conference are illustrated by the following excerpt from its second meeting:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Conference

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==First Conference: Accra, 8-13 December 1958==
The first conference was preceded by a Preparatory Committee composed of representatives from the eight independent African states—other than South Africa. (They were [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Liberia]], [[Libya]], [[Morocco]], [[Tunisia]], and the [[United Arab Republic]].) The conference itself was attended by delegates from 28 African countries and colonies. The number of delegates was more than 300, and the conference claimed that they represented more than 200 million people from all parts of Africa.
[[Tom Mboya]], General Secretary of the [[Kenya Federation of Labour]], was elected chairman.

One important discussion was over the legitimacy and desirability of using violence against the colonial powers. It was agreed that violence would be necessary in some cases. Concerning the struggle in [[Algeria]], full support was given to the recently proclaimed [[Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic|Provisional Republican Government]] (''Gouvernement Provisoire de la République Algérienne''—GPRA). On the [[Cameroon]], the Conference supported the fight of the [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon|UPC]] maquis, demanding full [[amnesty]] and [[United Nations|UN]]-sponsored elections. The Conference considered unity and solidarity to be key strategies in the fight against colonialism and economic domination after colonialism; it called for the establishment of Africa-wide organisations, including trade unions youth groups, and a Bureau of Liberatory Movements. It was at this meeting that the decision was made to establish a permanent secretariat at Accra. The first secretary-general was [[George Padmore]], then living in Ghana. The following year, he died and was replaced by Guinea's Resident Minister in Ghana, [[Abdoulaye Diallo]].

Prominent persons at the first Conference included:&lt;ref&gt;Houser, ''No One Can Stop the Rain'' (1989), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kwame Nkrumah]], leader of the newly independent [[Ghana]] 
* [[Patrice Lumumba]], who headed the [[Republic of the Congo (Leopoldville)|Congolese]] delegation
* [[Kenneth Kaunda]] of Zambia
* [[Hastings Banda]] of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] (and later President of [[Malawi]])
* [[Holden Roberto]], using the name Rui Ventura, of Angola

International observers came from the [[Soviet Union]] (within the [[Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee]]) and the [[People's Republic of China]]. Congressman [[Charles Diggs]] was in attendance, but without support from the US government.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, ''No One Can Stop the Rain'' (1989), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Slogans displayed by Ghanaians holding signs during the Conference:&lt;ref&gt;Houser, ''No One Can Stop the Rain'' (1989), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Hands Off Africa"
* "Africa Must Be Free"
* "Down With Imperialism and Colonialism"
* "We prefer independence with danger to servitude in tranquility"

Wallerstein summarises by saying: "The impact of this and subsequent AAPC meetings on political awareness in Africa is difficult to measure, but nonetheless very real. The AAPC brought many African nationalist leaders into contact for the first time with others who had already won independence for their countries or were in active and violent struggle for it."&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Conference: Tunis, 25–30 January 1960==
One feature of the AAPC was tension between conservative and avant-garde elements. Neither Mboya nor Nkrumah, key leaders at the Accra Conference, attended the second conference in Tunis.&lt;ref name=House75&gt;Houser, ''No One Can Stop the Rain'' (1989), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;
The conference adopted a proposal by the Algerians and Moroccans for an "international corps of volunteers" to go to fight in Algeria in the manner of the International Brigade that had gone to [[Spanish Civil War|Spain]] in the 1930s. The [[Algerian War of Independence]] was a primary focus of the Conference.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, ''No One Can Stop the Rain'' (1989), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in the Congress also joined with 200,000-plus Tunisians in a protest of  [[France_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#Saharan_experiments_centers_(1960–1966)|France's atomic tests in the Sahara]].&lt;ref name=House75/&gt;

The Conference voiced considerable concern over neocolonialism—the tendency of the nominally freed states to actually remain subjugated to the imperialist powers because of economic dependency and other factors. This was expressed, for example, in the ''Economic and Social Resolution'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;SPAN style="text-align:center; font-style:italic"&gt;
Economic and Social Resolution
&lt;/SPAN&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Considering the underdeveloped state of African economies which is a result of the colonial system and foreign domination;&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Considering the tendency of the colonialist countries to substitute economic for political domination
and thus rob the newly won independence of the African states of its true content;&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Considering also the departmentalisation and lack of harmony existing in the African economies and the inadequacy of technical cadres and finance;&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Considering that economic growth and development constitute the surest guarantee of the freedom of the African continent;&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Considering that foreign Powers sometimes use their economic aid as a means of endeavouring to divide the  African territories and isolate the Independent States from territories that are still under colonial rule;

The Conference

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Affirms that independence is a prerequisite to all economic development;&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Declares that the peoples of Africa are determined to work for the economic development and liberation of Africa, for the benefit and under the control of the masses;&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Recommends to the independent African states:

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I. The intensification of their efforts to wrest their respective countries from economic dependence
on the imperialist countries....&lt;ref&gt;"Resolutions adopted by the Second All-African Peoples' Conference, Tunis, 30 January 1960", in Gott, Major and Warner, p. 351.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The general resolution also spoke on this topic:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Conference
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;...recommends the African governments to be active in liquidating the neo-colonialist groups, particularly any foreign military establishments on their soil;&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Considering moreover the important social and economic "enclaves" created by the imperialist countries in Africa in the industrial and agricultural sectors, by the establishment of special monetary, financial, technical and social institutions entirely controlled by themselves;&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Observing these foreign 'enclaves' result in the exploitation of the human, vegetable and mineral resources of Africa, and that they have been installed in the service of foreign economic systems;&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Observing further that the existence of these "enclaves" enables the imperialist countries to bind the economy of certain African countries very stringently in the domains of customs, finance, trade, currency, etc.;&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Considering on the other hand, that the imperialists are aiming at the organisation of all these new institutions of domination with each African people taken separately, while they are themselves co-ordinating strictly their action in order to present a united front against the efforts of economic liberation on the part of Africa;&lt;BR&gt;

The Conference

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Affirms the absolute necessity of turning the economy of the African countries to the profit of its peoples, and of acting with unity in the economic field, as in the political and cultural fields;&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Proposes therefore the creation by all the Independent African States, of common organisations for the
conduct of finance and commerce, and of centres of social and economic research, for the purpose of studying the forms of technical assistance to Africa and of training the technicians whom Africa needs to ensure her economic development and her social progress;&lt;BR&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Proclaims finally the irrevocable character of the movement towards African independence, liberty and unity; ...&lt;ref&gt;"Resolutions adopted by the Second All-African Peoples' Conference", Tunis, 30 January 1960. In Gott, Major and Warner, pp. 350, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Conference was particularly critical of the [[France|French]] government for taking measures to limit the sovereignty of its territories in North Africa that were being decolonised.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Considering the existence of the French Community, a new form of imperialist domination, and the present attempts of the French Government to impose upon countries associated with this community and on the threshold of independence, bonds of a kind which would deprive them of true national sovereignty;...&lt;ref name=Resp;utions350/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Third Conference: Cairo, 25–31 March 1961==
The mood at this conference was more militant than at the second conference, partly because some conservative groups had withdrawn, and partly because the conference occurred during the crisis in the Congo. The Congolese issue was raised by the Secretary-General, Abdoulaye Diallo, in his opening address:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Today there are two forces existing in the Congo; forces which represent the imperialist interests, and forces which represent the interests of the Congolese people. The former are led by Messrs. [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu|Kasavubu]], [[Moise Tshombe|Tshombe]], and their cohorts; the latter, or in other words ours, are led by Mr. [[Antoine Gizenga|Gizenga]], who has the sympathy of all the people and the support of the immense majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wallerstein, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Later, the Conference adopted a very strong resolution on the Congo:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Conference denounces the role played by General Kettani in the degradation of the situation in the Congo and demands the dismissal of [[Dag Hammarskjöld]] equally responsible for the murder of Lumumba.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Wallerstein pp. 51, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In another clause Kasavubu, Mobutu, Tshombe and Kalonji were denounced for their role. The Conference proclaimed Lumumba the "hero of Africa".

The issue of neocolonialism was again raised by the Conference; its four-page ''Resolution on Neocolonialism'' is cited as a landmark for having presented a collectively arrived at definition of neocolonialism and a description of its main features.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, p. 52: "It attempted the one serious, collectively agreed upon definition of neocolonialism, the key concept in the armory of the revolutionary core of the movement for African unity."
Also William D. Graf, review of Yolamu R. Barongo, ''Neocolonialism and African Politics: a Survey of the Impact of Neocolonialism on African Political Behaviour'' (1980); ''Canadian Journal of African Studies'', p. 601: "The term itself originated in Africa, probably with Nkrumah, and received collective recognition at the 1961 All-African People's Conference."&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal contradictions within the AAPC led to its eventual demise. Wallerstein has described the make up of the AAPC around the time of the Third Congress:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The AAPC had become the meeting ground of three groups:
African nationalists in non-independent countries, whose revolutionary ardor was often tactical and hence temporary;
leaders of the so-called revolutionary African states, whose militancy was often tempered by the exigencies of diplomacy
and the reality of world economic pressures; African radical-nationalist opposition movements in independent states, which states were considered by these opposition movements as clients or "puppets" of the West. This latter group (which included the UPC, the Sawaba of Niger led by [[Djibo Bakary]], the Moroccan Union Nationale des Forces Populaires [UNFP]
represented by [[Mehdi Ben Barka]]) was perhaps the most genuinely and the most persistently militant. It also had the least real power.
Therefore, while this third group often dominated the conferences and gave the tone to the resolutions, it was the second group (the governments) that dominated the structure and held the purse strings.&lt;ref name=Wallerstein52&gt;Wallerstein, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The difference between the two groups was to prove fatal to the AAPC, as radical pronouncements by the Conference began to pose difficulties for its governmental members in their diplomatic relations with the more conservative African states. Although it was decided at the 1961 Conference that a fourth Conference be held at [[Bamako, Mali]], in February 1962, that
meeting never took place because the host government, Mali, and the Secretary-General's government, Guinea, were reluctant to proceed with it. Wallerstein says that "The Casablanca governments were content to let the AAPC disappear quietly in their attempts to come to terms with the other African governments."&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=Wallerstein52/&gt;

With the professionalization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legisworks.org/congress/64/publaw-85.pdf |title=National Defense Act of 1916 |accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the US Military preceding [[World War I]] including the creation of the [[National Guard of the United States]] and the federalization of officer training, the Company's mission changed to a supportive role in preserving the historic and patriotic traditions of Boston, Massachusetts, and the Nation. Today the Company serves as [[Guard of honour|Honor Guard]] to the [[Governor of Massachusetts]] who is also its Commander in Chief. The headquarters is located on the 4th floor of [[Faneuil Hall]] and consists of an armory, library, offices, quartermaster department, commissary, and military museum with free admission.

==History==
 [[File:First Town House1.jpg|thumb|100px|left|First Town-House, Boston where the AHAC would meet.]]
[[File:Col Thomas Crafts Jr.png|thumb|100px|left|Colonel [[Thomas Crafts, Jr.]], a member of the AHAC]]
As the settlements which followed the landing at Plymouth increased and spread, there was no organized military force for protection - only local volunteer companies, which lacked the capacity for joint action or any centralized authority. Many of the settlers of Boston had been members in England of the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] (HAC) of London, and the military training they had received in that company led them to form a similar organization in the new country. In 1637 the company was formed as a citizen militia for instruction in military discipline and tactics. [[Robert Keayne]] and many of the original members of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company had been members of the original HAC of London.

Governor Winthrop granted a charter on March 13, 1638, and on the first Monday in June following, an election of officers was held on [[Boston Common]]. The original name of the Company was "The Military Company of Massachusetts". It began to be referred to as "The Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company" in the year 1737.

Among the charter members was [[Nicholas Upsall]], who later forsook his membership to join the [[Quakers in North America|Quakers]]. Since that time, the company has continued to hold their annual elections on the Boston Common on the first Monday in June by casting their votes on a drum head. Company membership has long been considered a distinction among the New England gentry in a similar manner to which regimental membership conferred distinction on the sons of the English gentry. The [[Honourable Artillery Company|Honourable Artillery Company of London]] and the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts acknowledge and celebrate their common historical roots.

Since 1746, the headquarters of the Company has been located in [[Faneuil Hall]]. In this armory, the company maintains a military museum with free admission and library containing relics from every war the United States has fought since its settlement. The armory is open to the public daily.

Prior to 1913, the Company served as the ''de facto'' officer school for the Massachusetts Militia. (Although not all officers in the Massachusetts Militia were selected from members of the Company.) In 1913, the Massachusetts Militia established the Training School for officer training. This school was later renamed the Massachusetts Military Academy and is today designated the 101st Regiment - Regional Training Institute (RTI).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/101rti.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The company reenacts the election of officers every 1st Monday in June (June Day Parade).  A parade consisting of the AHAC, Massachusetts National Guard (MANG), members of the USS Constitution, Washington Light Infantry (South Carolina), and other historic military groups from across New England participate in the parade from Faneuil Hall to Boston Common. On occasion, members of the Honorable Artillery Company of London participate. A representative of the Swiss Guard may also be in attendance. Upon the arrival of the Governor of the State of Massachusetts, the MANG will fire a cannon volley. During the reenactment ceremony, the Governor will accept resignations of the Captain Commanding, and 1st and 2nd Lieutenants. New commissions will be issued by the Governor.

==Membership==
Membership in the company has traditionally been selected from the upper middle and upper classes of Boston society. In recent decades membership has been expanded to include those from outside of Massachusetts. It is common for senior officers in the Massachusetts National Guard to be members of the Company. Although prior military service is not a requirement for membership, about one third of the current (2014) members of the Company have served in the Armed Forces of the United States, in most cases as commissioned officers.

Prior to the late 20th Century, the membership of the Company was almost exclusively [[white Anglo-Saxon Protestant]]s (WASPs). In recent decades, however, the Company has recruited a more diverse membership.

Most individuals who join the Company are elected as Regular Members. After serving in the Company for a prescribed period of time, Regular Members become Life Members.

Individuals who are descendants of members of the Company who joined prior to 1738 may join as members by right of descent. Members by Right of Descent (ROD)have discounted membership fees but may not vote or hold office in the Company. ROD members residing in New England are enrolled as full (regular) members and pay full dues. In rare cases, honorary membership is extended to highly distinguished individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahac.us.com/membership.htm|title=Ancient Honorable Artillery Company Massachusetts AHA Ancients|first=Eric|last=Sigillo|website=www.ahac.us.com|access-date=2014-06-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222185424/http://www.ahac.us.com/membership.htm|archive-date=2017-02-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company members have served in [[King Philip's War]], [[King William's War]], [[Queen Anne's War]], [[King George's War]], the [[French and Indian War]], the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], the [[War of 1812]], the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]], the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]], the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War]], the [[Iraq War]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="cohistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahac.us.com/history.htm |title=HISTORY OF THE COMPANY (SUMMARY) |publisher=Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts |date= |author= |accessdate=10 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723053316/http://www.ahac.us.com/history.htm |archive-date=2012-07-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Company has had ten members who were awarded the Medal of Honor (three of whom are still living), and has also had four members who served as President of the United States: Presidents [[James Monroe]], [[Chester A. Arthur]], [[Calvin Coolidge]] and [[John F. Kennedy]]. Honorary membership was also extended to [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], King [[Edward VII]] and King [[George V]]. A number of [[Governors of Massachusetts]] have also been members of the Company.

In 2012, the organization voted to induct its first woman members. [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Catherine M. Corkery and Colonel Christine Hoffmann, both officers in the [[Massachusetts National Guard]], were inducted into the organization on September 17, 2012.&lt;ref name="woman"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2012/09/09/centuries-old-military-organization-votes-include-women-for-first-time/YdYpvGuUGlyIOWOB2L1WSN/story.html?s_campaign=8315 |title=Mass. corps votes in first female members |work=[[Boston Globe]] |date=10 September 2012 |author=Martine Powers |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Assata: An Autobiography''''' is a 1988 autobiographical book by [[Assata Shakur]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/06/books/in-short-nonfiction-880388.html|date= 1988|title=IN SHORT; NONFICTION|authorlink=E.

==Critical reception==
''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} review stated "The book's abrupt shifts in time can annoy after a while, as can the liberties she takes with spelling - ''court,'' ''America'' and ''Rockefeller,'' for example, become ''kourt,'' ''amerika'' and ''Rockafella.'' But, all in all, the author provides a spellbinding tale that evokes mixed feelings in the way the autobiographies of [[Malcolm X]], [[Robert "Sonny" Carson|Sonny Carson]] and [[Claude Brown]] did in years past."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

The '''Bharatiya Janshakti Party''' (Indian People's Power Party) was founded on 30 April 2006 in [[Ujjain]] in the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]]. It was founded by [[Uma Bharti]], a former leader of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), following her expulsion from the BJP for indiscipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manjesh|first=Sindhu|title=Who is Uma Bharti?|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/people/who-is-uma-bharti-348608|publisher=NDTV|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She stated that her Janshakti party also followed the ideology of the [[RSS]], and had its support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhagwat|first=Ramu|title=Own up responsibility, Uma Bharti tells BJP|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-07-02/nagpur/28201126_1_uma-bharti-babri-mosque-demolition-bjp-leaders|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=Times of India|date=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Uma Bharti re-joining [[BJP]] in June 2011, the Bharatiya Janshakti Party merged with the BJP. BJS working president [[Sangh Priya Gautam]] announced the merger here in the presence of BJP national president [[Nitin Gadkari]], Ms Bharti and other senior leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uma Bharti's BJS merges into BJP|url=http://news.webindia123.com/news/articles/India/20110630/1782640.html|publisher=Web India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bharatiya Janshakti Party had a marked lack of political success in its five-year career; Bharti later stated that she severely regretted the time she spent outside the BJP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manjesh|first=Sindhu|title=Who is Uma Bharti?|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/people/who-is-uma-bharti-348608|publisher=NDTV|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2008 State Assembly Elections, the party won only 6 out of the 230 seats in the State Legislative Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Election Result - 2008 State Assembly Elections|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/assembly-elections-2013/assemblyelectionresultmap.cms?stateid=madhya-pradesh|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Byrdcliffe Colony''', also called the '''Byrdliffe Arts Colony''' or '''Byrdcliffe Historic District''', was founded in 1902 near [[Woodstock, New York]] by Jane Byrd McCall and [[Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://antiquesandthearts.com/CS0-06-10-2003-11-49-23# |title=Antiques and Art Online: "Byrdcliffe Arts Colony" |access-date=2007-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213203/http://antiquesandthearts.com/CS0-06-10-2003-11-49-23# |archive-date=2007-09-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and colleagues, [[Bolton Brown]] (artist) and [[Hervey White]] (writer). It is the oldest operating Arts and Crafts Colony in America. The Arts and Crafts Movement arose in the late nineteenth century in reaction to the dehumanizing monotony and standardization of industrial production. Byrdcliffe was created as an experiment in utopian living inspired by the arts and crafts movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.marist.edu/summerscholars/00/history/brdclif.htm# |title=A Historical Colony of Art: Byrdcliffe |access-date=2007-09-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901113226/http://www.marist.edu/summerscholars/00/history/brdclif.htm# |archive-date=2007-09-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colony is still in operation today and is located on {{convert|300|acre|km2}} with 35 original buildings, all designed in the Arts and Crafts style. There is a self-guided walking tour through the compound as well as a hiking path that leads to the mountain top which gives way to scenic Catskill views.

The colony continues to foster the development of artistic vision. Along with ongoing music, theater and art performances held in the Byrdcliffe Theater, Barn and on property lawns, The Byrdcliffe Colony hosts an Artist-In-Residence program that houses over 70 artists each summer who practice in a wide variety of fields and media. The program accepts writers, composers, and visual artists. Byrdcliffe maintains an exhibition and performance space in the heart of Woodstock, the Kleinert/James Center for the Arts, which hosts 6 or 7 exhibitions of primarily contemporary art annually.

==Location==
Woodstock is surrounded by the [[Catskill Mountains]] of [[New York State]]. The entire Byrdcliffe estate lay on 1,500 acres (6&amp;nbsp;km²) on the south-facing side of [[Mount Guardian]], just above Woodstock. This location provides the rustic landscape meant to inspire and elevate the art community. Additionally, Woodstock offers close proximity to the art and culture of New York City&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodstockguild.org/byrdcliffehistory.html Woodstock Byrdcliffe Guild] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110204634/http://www.woodstockguild.org/byrdcliffehistory.html# |date=2011-01-10 }} Retrieved December 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and was home to well-known painters like Milton Avery and Philip Guston.

==History==
For many years, Whitehead held the idea of creating an Arts and Crafts community where all the arts would come together, including painting, sculpture, music, metalwork, and furniture making.  After a failed attempt to establish a community near Santa Barbara, California and Albany, Oregon, he scouted the East Coast for a suitable site, sending painter and lithographer [[Bolton Brown]] on a three-week excursion through the Hudson Valley, where he would select Woodstock, NY and begin construction.&lt;ref name="Murphy 2017"&gt;Murphy, John. "Athletic Aesthetics: Art, Craft and Bolton Brown," ''Art in Print'' Vol. 7 No. 2 (July–August 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The Byrdcliffe Arts Colony received its name as a combination of Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead's middle name and his wife's, Jane Byrd McCall Whitehead, middle name.

Artists, writers, musicians, social reformers, and intellectuals came from across the country to stay at Byrdcliffe and gain inspiration from the setting and people with shared artistic goals. Facilities included studios for painting, weaving, pottery, metalwork, woodworking; cottages with bathrooms and [[sleeping porches]]; a library, and a rambling villa for Whitehead and his family. He built "White Pines" as his residence with a skylit cathedral ceilinged weaving room overlooking a picturesque view across the Woodstock Valley.

The artist colony of Byrdcliffe failed to fulfill its goals as a self-sufficient arts community. It became too expensive and Ralph Whitehead's dominating personality became a confining force. Byrdcliffe survived for almost 30 years under Whitehead's vision until his death in 1929.

After Ralph Whitehead's death in 1929, his widow, Jane, and son Peter struggled to keep the colony alive. After Jane's death in 1955, Peter sold much of the land to pay taxes and maintenance on the heart of the colony which he kept intact. The Whiteheads intended to preserve Byrdcliffe "for the purpose of promoting among the residents of Woodstock...the study, practice and development of skill in the fine arts and crafts, as well as a true appreciation thereof..."

Although the [[handicraft|arts and crafts]] [[utopian experiment]] soon ran out of steam, the continuing magic of Byrdcliffe enthralled many notable people including the educator [[John Dewey]], author [[Thomas Mann]] and naturalist [[John Burroughs]]. [[Isadora Duncan]] danced at White Pines; [[Bob Dylan]] lived in a house at Byrdcliffe in the '60s and early '70s; Joanne Woodward was involved in the River Arts Repertory at the Byrdcliffe Theatre.

==Artist In Residence Program==
The Artist in Residence program has operated at Byrdcliffe for approximately 20 years and now hosts over 75 artists throughout four summer sessions. Artists live either in two large communal buildings, or in independent cottages, fostering a creative community as originally intended by the founders. There are numerous large work spaces and studios in multiple buildings on the property. The program sees an especially large influx of practicing visual artists, as well as published writers, college professors and professional composers, looking for retreat time to concentrate on their work. Facilities open for use by Byrdcliffe artists are a ceramics studio, jewelry making studio, darkroom, and large performance spaces such as the Byrdcliffe Theater and the Barn. Composers work in a small studio with a 1905 Steinway upright piano.

==Merger with Woodstock Guild of Craftsmen==
Upon Peter Whitehead's death in 1975, Byrdcliffe was left to the Woodstock Guild of Craftsmen which has continued to maintain and administer programs at the colony. In 1979, the Byrdcliffe Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its historical and architectural significance. Byrdcliffe's cottages have been rented since 1984 only to working artists, maintaining sympathy with the founder's creative vision.

==Woodstock Byrdcliffe Guild==
Byrdcliffe is now owned by the Woodstock Byrdcliffe Guild (WBG), a non-profit multi-arts organization with over 600 members. WBG's Kleinert/James Center for the Arts hosts local and national performing, visual, and literary artists. The WBG offers a variety of classes in the arts.

Byrdcliffe is an important regional example of the movement to create utopian enclaves in America and continues as a place for artists to gain inspiration, live, and work.

'''''CTB v News Group Newspapers''''' is an [[English law|English legal case]] between [[Manchester United]] player [[Ryan Giggs]],&lt;ref name="skynews"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/story/856674/gagging-order-footballer-named-in-commons |title=MP Names Footballer at Centre of Gagging Order in House of Commons |work=[[Sky News]] |location=UK |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=24 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016053555/http://news.sky.com/story/856674/gagging-order-footballer-named-in-commons|archivedate=16 October 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; given the [[pseudonym]] CTB, and defendants [[News International|News Group Newspapers Limited]] and model [[Imogen Thomas]]. 

On 14 April 2011, [[David Eady|Mr Justice Eady]] granted first a temporary [[injunction]] at the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in [[London]], preventing the naming of the footballer in the media, then extending it on 21 April 2011. The injunction was initially intended to prevent details of the case – an alleged extra-marital relationship between Giggs and Thomas – from being published in ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.&lt;ref name=eady_16_may /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=CTB v News Group Newspapers Ltd &amp; Anor |court= EWHC |division=QB |year=2011 |num=1232 |date=16 May 2011 |courtname=auto |juris=England and Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling of the court was based on [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]], which guarantees the "Right to respect for private and family life."

Following the publication of details of the [[Gag order|gagging order]] on [[Twitter]], naming Giggs as the footballer involved, there was widespread discussion in the UK and international media on the issue of how court injunctions can be enforced in the age of [[social media]] websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://techland.time.com/2011/05/21/twitters-super-duper-u-k-censorship-trouble/ |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |location=USA |title=Twitter's Super-Duper U.K. Censorship Trouble |first=Jerry|last=Brito|date=21 May 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/europe/05/23/uk.privacy.laws/index.html?hpt=C1|work=[[CNN]] |location=USA |title=Social media making mockery of privacy laws|first=Peter|last=Wilkinson|date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May 2011, Justice Eady rejected News Group Newspapers' application to lift the injunction, despite pressure from the public and government. Later the same day, [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] MP [[John Hemming (politician)|John Hemming]] used [[parliamentary privilege]] to name Ryan Giggs as CTB.&lt;ref name="skynews" /&gt;

==Background==
On 14 April 2011, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' published a story entitled "Footie star’s affair with ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]''’s Imogen Thomas". It claimed that "a [[Premier League]] star" had met Thomas at luxury hotels during a "six-month fling", but did not name the footballer involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3526696/Footie-stars-affair-with-Big-Brothers-Imogen-Thomas.html|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] | location=UK |title=Footie star’s affair with Big Brother’s Imogen Thomas |date=14 April 2011 |accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Sunday Times]]'',&lt;ref name ="sunday_times"&gt;"The leftie banker who outed Giggs". Richard Woods, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 29 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the first mention on [[Twitter]] of the alleged relationship between Giggs and Thomas may have been posted at 10:02 PM [[British Summer Time|BST]] by James Webley on 14 April 2011, the day of the initial granting of the injunction. Webley is a UK citizen from [[Guildford]] with the Twitter username "@unknownj".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Banker refutes claim that he was first to break super injunction |date=31 May 2011 |url=http://www.how-do.co.uk/north-west-media-news/north-west-digital-media/banker-refutes-claim-that-he-was-first-to-break-super-injunction-2011053111111/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zHNtsC8n?url=http://www.how-do.co.uk/north-west-media-news/north-west-digital-media/banker-refutes-claim-that-he-was-first-to-break-super-injunction-2011053111111/ |archivedate=8 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Webley denied being the  source of the leak, and pointed to a web page written by a man named Michael Wheeler that he had read on the same day, which he said strongly hinted that Giggs was the person involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pseudonode.com/ |title=A few clarifications… |first=James |last=Webley |publisher=www.pseudonode.com |accessdate=29 May 2011 |date=29 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z3356SWS?url=http://pseudonode.com/ |archivedate=May 29, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmediaimages.com/celebrity-article-22757-imogen-thomas-is-welsh-who-else-do-you-know-who-is-welsh/ |title=Imogen Thomas is from Wales.

On 8 May 2011, an account on social networking site [[Twitter]] was created under the name "Billy Jones", and posted the alleged details of several of the [[2011 British super-injunction controversy|anonymised privacy injunctions]] that had been mentioned in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13330409 |work=[[BBC]] | location=UK |title=Twitter user in bid to break super-injunctions |date=9 May 2011 |accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the claim that the married footballer known as CTB had been involved in a seven-month extra-marital relationship with model [[Imogen Thomas]]. While Thomas could be named in the UK media, the identity of CTB could not.&lt;ref name = guardian /&gt; On the same date, messages saying that the identity of claimant CTB was [[Manchester United]] player [[Ryan Giggs]] were posted on Twitter and subsequently reported in a number of non-UK media sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sportsgrid.com/media/manchester-uniteds-ryan-giggs-is-the-footballer-who-allegedly-had-affair-with-model-imogen-thomas | work=[[Sportsgrid]] |location=USA |title=Manchester United’s Ryan Giggs Is The Footballer Who Allegedly Had Affair With Model Imogen Thomas |date=9 May 2011 |accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2011/05/11/imogen-thomas-footballer-lover-named-by-foreign-papers-not-affected-by-uk-injunctions-115875-23121827 |work=[[Daily Mirror]] |location=UK |title=Imogen Thomas footballer lover named by foreign papers not affected by UK injunctions |date=11 May 2011 |first=David |last=Collins |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The allegations were repeatedly reposted online by other users, in a similar response to that of the [[Twitter Joke Trial]] the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/8507522/Super-injunction-Twitter-traffic-record-broken.html |title=Super-injunction: Twitter traffic record broken |last=Barnett |first=Emma |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=UK |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Video-Super-Injunctions-Legal-Action-Against-Twitter-As-Study-Into-Use-Of-Gagging-Orders-Published/Article/201105315996477 |work=[[Sky News]] |location=UK |title=Twitter Users Hit Back At Footballer's Gag |date=21 May 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In delivering his ruling on the case on 16 May 2011, Eady argued: "It will rarely be the case that the privacy rights of an individual or of his family will have to yield in priority to what has been described in the [[House of Lords]] as 'tittle-tattle about the activities of footballers' wives and girlfriends.'" He also argued that a balance had to be struck between [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]], which guarantees the right to [[privacy]], and [[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights]], which guarantees the right to [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]]. Eady denied in the ruling that he was "introducing a law of privacy by the back door", which had been a common criticism of his decisions in the UK media, and stated that the principles involved in the ruling were "readily apparent from the terms of the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]], and indeed from the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention]] itself."&lt;ref name=eady_16_may /&gt; The Human Rights Act 1998 had been passed by the UK government, and incorporated the terms of the Convention into UK law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/946390.stm|work=[[BBC News]] |location=UK |title=Human Rights Act: How it works|date=29 September 2000 |accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruling also suggested that Imogen Thomas had attempted to [[blackmail]] the footballer for [[Pound sterling|£]]50,000 and £100,000, a claim she strongly denied. Following a failed attempt by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' to lift the injunction on 16 May 2011, Thomas commented: "Yet again my name and reputation have been trashed while the man I had a relationship with is able to hide. What's more I can't even defend myself because I have been gagged. If this is the way privacy injunctions are supposed to work there is something seriously wrong with the law."&lt;ref name = guardian&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/16/imogen-thomas-superinjunction-affair-footballer|work=[[The Guardian]] | location=UK| title=Imogen Thomas 'blackmailed' superinjunction footballer, judge says|date=16 May 2011 |last1=Sabbagh |first1=Dan |authorlink1=Dan Sabbagh |last2=Halliday |first2=Josh |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eady said that he could not "come to any final conclusion" on whether there had been an attempt at blackmail.&lt;ref name=eady_16_may /&gt;

It was stated in the ruling that Imogen Thomas had "at some stage engaged the services of Mr [[Max Clifford]]", the well-known UK [[publicist]], and that the purpose of meetings Thomas had arranged with the footballer had been "that ''The Sun'' was ready to take advantage of these prearranged meetings in order to be able to put forward the claim that it was ''The Sun'' which had found him 'romping with a busty ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' babe'".&lt;ref name=eady_16_may /&gt;

The headquarters of Twitter are in [[San Francisco]], and legal experts pointed out the difficulties in suing in a United States court, where [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protection applies to [[freedom of speech]]. London-based lawyer James Quartermaine commented: “Twitter will probably just ignore it and consider it to be offensive to their First Amendment rights. It’s probably an attempt to try and show that actions have consequences in [[cyberspace]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/playbook/2011/05/british-soccer-sues-twitter |work=[[Wired News]] |location=USA |title=British Soccer Star Sues Twitter Over Privacy Issue |first= Eric |last=Malinowski |date=20 May 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 May 2011, lawyers at Schillings denied that they were suing Twitter, and said that they had made an application "to obtain limited information concerning the unlawful use of Twitter by a small number of individuals who may have breached a [[court order]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/863975-ctb-footballer-facing-backlash-as-lawyers-claim-he-isnt-suing-twitter |work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |location=UK |first=Kavi |last=Shah |title=CTB footballer facing backlash as lawyers claim he 'isn't suing Twitter' |date=21 May 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Why? Because we believe it is unsustainable that the law can be used to prevent newspapers from publishing information that readers can access on the internet at the click of a mouse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/22/scottish-newspaper-identifies-injuction-footballer |title=Scottish newspaper identifies injunction footballer |last1=Gabbatt |first1=Adam |last2=Taylor |first2=Matthew |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=UK |date=22 May 2011 |accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sunday Herald'' also stated: "We should point out immediately that we are not accusing the footballer concerned of any misdeed.

The issue is one of [[freedom of information]] and of a growing argument in favour of more restrictive [[privacy]] laws."&lt;ref name="BBC Herald"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13491086 |work=[[BBC News]] |location=UK |title=Sunday Herald names footballer accused on Twitter|date=22 May 2011 |accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giggs' lawyers had not applied for an [[Interdicts in Scots law|interdict]] ([[injunction]]) at the [[Court of Session]] in [[Edinburgh]]. This meant that the London [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] ruling had no force in Scotland, unless copies of the ''Sunday Herald'' were sold in England or Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/alexmassie/6965074/the-footballer-is-named.thtml |work=[[The Spectator]] |location=UK |title=The Footballer is Named |first=Alex |last=Massie |date=22 May 2011 |accessdate=22 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525010028/http://www.spectator.co.uk/alexmassie/6965074/the-footballer-is-named.thtml# |archive-date=2011-05-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sunday Herald'' editor Richard Walker indicated to the BBC that the ''Herald'' was not sold in England or Wales, and added that the footballer's name and photo were exclusive to the print edition and had not been posted on the newspaper's website.&lt;ref name="BBC Herald"/&gt; [[Dominic Grieve]], the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]], said that no legal action was planned against the ''Sunday Herald''.&lt;ref name="BBC_law"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13498504 |work=[[BBC News]] |location=UK |title=Privacy injunctions unsustainable, says Cameron|date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming in Parliament and subsequent events==
On 23 May 2011, Eady refused a fresh application from ''The Sun'' to lift the injunction and allow CTB to be named.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/23/sun-gagging-order-footballer |title=Sun fails in latest bid to lift footballer's gagging order |last=Halliday |first=Josh |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=UK |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that "the court's duty remains to try and protect the claimant, and particularly his family, from intrusion and harassment so long as it can." ''The Sun'' had argued that the injunction was "futile" given the level of knowledge of the footballer's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/committee-to-look-at-gagging-orders-2288063.html |work=[[The Independent]] |location=UK |title=Committee to look at gagging orders |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same afternoon, [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Member of Parliament [[John Hemming (politician)|John Hemming]] spoke in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and used [[parliamentary privilege]] to name Ryan Giggs as the footballer CTB.&lt;ref name=MP&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Video-MP-Names-Footballer-At-Centre-Of-Gagging-Order-In-House-Of-Commons/Article/201105415997439?f=vg|work=[[Sky News]] |location=UK |title=Gagging Order: MP Names Footballer In Commons|date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansard, [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110523/debtext/110523-0001.htm#column_638 HC Deb 23 May 2011], col 638&lt;/ref&gt;  A second attempt by ''The Sun'' to overturn the injunction later in the day was rejected by [[Michael Tugendhat|Mr Justice Tugendhat]], who argued "this is not about secrecy, this is about intrusion."&lt;ref name = guardian2&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2011/may/23/ryan-giggs-injunction-mp|work=[[The Guardian]] | location=UK| title=Injunction remains despite MP's revelation|date=23 May 2011 |last1=Sabbagh |first1=Dan |authorlink1=Dan Sabbagh |last2=Halliday |first2=Josh |accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2011, Mr Justice Eady accepted that Thomas had not attempted to blackmail the footballer known as CTB, and suggested "There is no longer any point in maintaining the anonymity." The injunction preventing the naming of CTB remained in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/dec/15/imogen-thomas-football?newsfeed=true|title=Imogen Thomas 'vindicated' after footballer drops blackmail claim |last=Plunkett |first=John|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=UK  |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2012, Ryan Giggs consented in the High Court to being named as the claimant known as CTB. Hugh Tomlinson [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], acting for Giggs, said that his client was claiming damages from ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' for the subsequent re-publication of information in other newspapers and on the Internet. For ''The Sun'''s owners News Group Newspapers, Richard Spearman QC said: "We didn't identify him. We didn't intend to identify him.

==Reactions==
In response to criticism of previous super-injunctions in the UK media, a report by a committee of judges headed by [[Master of the Rolls]] [[David Neuberger, Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury|Lord Neuberger]] was published on 20 May 2011. It recommended that super-injunctions "can only be granted when they are strictly necessary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13465286 |work=[[BBC]] |location=UK |title=Media concession made in injunction report |date=20 May 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Reports/super-injunction-report-20052011.pdf Super-Injunctions, Anonymised Injunctions and Open Justice] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626023143/http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Reports/super-injunction-report-20052011.pdf# |date=2011-06-26 }} Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury, Master of the Rolls, www.judiciary.gov.uk, 20 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Clarke]], the [[Lord Chancellor]] and [[Secretary of State for Justice]], also indicated that the law on privacy in the UK will be reviewed in the light of controversies over privacy injunctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/8519961/Kenneth-Clarke-signals-privacy-law-to-ease-fears-over-gagging-orders.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=UK |last1=Winnett |first1=Robert |last2=Hope |first2=Christopher |title=Kenneth Clarke signals privacy law to ease fears over gagging orders |date=18 May 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Igor Judge, Baron Judge|Lord Judge]], the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], commented that modern technology was "out of control", and called for measures to prevent court injunctions from being breached on the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bc77fd2c-82c9-11e0-b97c-00144feabdc0.html |work=[[Financial Times]] |location=UK |last1=Croft |first1=Jane |last2=Bradshaw |first2=Tim |title=Technology out of control, says top judge |date=20 May 2011 |accessdate=21 May 2011}}{{registration required|date=march 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Cameron]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], said on [[ITV1|ITV1's]] ''[[Daybreak (ITV)|Daybreak]]'' on 23 May 2011: "It is rather unsustainable, this situation, where newspapers can't print something that clearly everybody else is talking about, but there's a difficulty here because the law is the law and the judges must interpret what the law is. What I've said in the past is, the danger is that judgments are effectively writing a new law which is what parliament is meant to do."  He added that the law should be reviewed to "catch up with how people consume media today".&lt;ref name="BBC_law" /&gt;

[[Alex Salmond]], the [[First Minister of Scotland]], commented: "The law essentially is a practical thing. It looks to me like the English law, English injunctions, look increasingly impractical in the modern world."&lt;ref name="BBC_law" /&gt;

Member of Parliament [[John Hemming (politician)|John Hemming]], who named Ryan Giggs in the House of Commons, described the affair as "a joke", and commented: "The judges’ application of privacy law, which is ill conceived to start with, is now close to breaking point, under pressure from the biggest act of [[civil disobedience]] seen for many years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/8529609/Newspaper-publishes-name-of-footballer-with-gagging-order.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=UK |first=Martin|last=Evans |title=Newspaper publishes name of footballer with gagging order |date=22 May 2011 |accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Wikipedia]] co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] commented in an interview with ''[[The Independent]]'': "This only became a story because the footballer is pursuing legal action against Twitter. In the UK, I think the system is going to have to change. People are going to realise that it is an infringement of the right to [[Freedom of speech|free speech]]. People are going to get sick of the rich and powerful being able to suppress things they do not want to get out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/online/wikipedia-founder-opens-new-front-in-privacy-battle-2287788.html|work=[[The Independent]] |location=UK |first=Kevin|last=Rawlinson |title=Wikipedia founder opens new front in privacy battle |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wakeham, Baron Wakeham|Lord Wakeham]], the chairman of the [[Press Complaints Commission]] between 1995 and 2001, described the situation surrounding privacy injunctions as "a shambles", and proposed that Parliament should amend the law so that judges would be able to grant injunctions only where issues “impact on public authorities and the State”.&lt;ref name=wakeham&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/8534600/Lord-Wakeham-law-must-be-changed-to-stop-judges-handing-out-gagging-orders.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=UK |first=Gordon|last=Rayner |title=Lord Wakeham: law must be changed to stop judges handing out gagging orders |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Berners-Lee|Sir Tim Berners-Lee]], the inventor of the [[World Wide Web]], expressed concern about the use of [[Twitter]] to break court injunctions, arguing that the site was “not a place for reasoned discussion”.&lt;ref name=wakeham /&gt;

Tony Wang, the head of [[Twitter]] in Europe, said that people who do "bad things" on the site would need to defend themselves under the laws of their own jurisdiction in the event of controversy, and that the site would hand over information about users to the authorities when it was legally required to do so.&lt;ref name=wang&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-13546847|work=[[BBC News]] |location=UK |title=Twitter's European boss Tony Wang gives legal warning|date=25 May 2011 |accessdate=25 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' on 29 May 2011, Ryan Giggs' [[barrister]] Hugh Tomlinson [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] commented: "I advise my clients that an injunction will not be effective. There have been too many examples of people breaking injunctions, getting round them by releasing material on to the Internet." He also suggested creating a statutory [[tort]] of privacy.&lt;ref name ="sunday_times" /&gt;

'''Computer recycling''', '''electronic recycling''' or '''e-waste recycling''' is the disassembly and separation of components and raw materials of waste electronics. Although the procedures of re-use, donation and repair are not strictly recycling, they are other common sustainable ways to dispose of IT waste.

In 2009, 38% of [[computer]]s and a quarter of total electronic waste was recycled in the United States, 5% and 3% up from 3 years prior respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Roadmap to Greener Computing|url = https://books.google.com/?id=G5l_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=38%2525+computers+recycling#v=onepage&amp;q=38%2525%2520computers%2520recycling&amp;f=false|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2014-05-09|isbn = 9781466506848|first = Raoul-Abelin Choumin|last = Nguemaleu|first2 = Lionel|last2 = Montheu|pages = 170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception in the early 1990s, more and more devices are recycled worldwide due to increased awareness and investment. Electronic recycling occurs primarily in order to recover valuable [[Rare earth element|rare earth metals]] and [[precious metal]]s, which are in short supply, as well as plastics and metals. These are resold or used in new devices after purification, in effect creating a [[circular economy]].
However one can also make use of the useful components of the dead computers that may be damaged beyond repair so as to make or use the parts on new computers which may cover on material costs as another cheap way of recycling at homes and working areas.

Recycling is considered environmentally friendly because it prevents hazardous waste, including [[Toxic heavy metal|heavy metals]] and carcinogens, from entering the atmosphere, landfill or waterways. While electronics consist a small fraction of total waste generated, they are far more dangerous. There is stringent legislation designed to enforce and encourage the sustainable disposal of appliances, the most notable being the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive of the [[European Union]] and the [[United States]] National Computer Recycling Act.&lt;ref&gt;National Computer Recycling Act of 2005, H.R. 425, 109th Cong. (2005–2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for recycling==
Obsolete computers and old electronics are valuable sources for secondary raw materials if recycled; otherwise, these devices are a source of [[toxic waste|toxins]] and [[carcinogen]]s. Rapid technology change, low initial cost, and [[planned obsolescence]] have resulted in a fast-growing surplus of computers and other electronic components around the globe. Technical solutions are available, but in most cases a legal framework, collection system, logistics, and other services need to be implemented before applying a technical solution. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]], estimates 30 to 40 million surplus [[Personal computer|PCs]], classified as "hazardous household waste",&lt;ref name=sb&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smartbiz.com/article/articleprint/1525/-1/58|publisher=SmartBiz|title=Tips and Tricks for Recycling Old Computers|author=Morgan, Russell|date=2006-08-21|accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; would be ready for end-of-life management in the next few years. The U.S. [[National Safety Council]] estimates that 75% of all personal computers ever sold are now surplus electronics.&lt;ref name=to&gt;{{cite news|url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/personal_tech/article4538181.ece|title=E-mail from America: Buy-back gadgets|author=Harris, Mark|location=[[Seattle, Washington]]|work=[[Sunday Times]]|date=2008-08-17|accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) stated that more than 63 million computers in the U.S. were traded in for replacements or discarded. Today, 15% of electronic devices and equipment are recycled in the United States. Most electronic waste is sent to [[landfill]]s or [[Incineration|incinerated]], which releases materials such as lead, mercury, or cadmium into the soil, groundwater, and atmosphere, thus having a negative impact on the environment.

Many materials used in computer hardware can be recovered by recycling for use in future production. Reuse of [[tin]], [[silicon]], [[iron]], [[aluminium]], and a variety of [[plastics]] that are present in bulk in computers or other electronics can reduce the costs of constructing new systems. Components frequently contain [[lead]], [[copper]], [[gold]] and other valuable materials suitable for reclamation.

[[Computer hardware|Computer components]] contain many toxic substances, like [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], [[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs), [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], [[radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] and  [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. A typical computer monitor may contain more than 6% lead by weight, much of which is in the [[lead glass]] of the [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT). A typical 15 inch (38&amp;nbsp;cm) computer monitor may contain {{convert|1.5|lb|kg|0}} of lead&lt;ref name=sb/&gt; but other monitors have been estimated to have up to {{convert|8|lb|kg|0}} of lead.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-9604019_ITM|title=E-gad!

In US landfills, about 40% of the lead content levels are from e-waste.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://computer.howstuffworks.com/discarded-old-computer1.htm|title=What Happens to your Discarded Old Computer?|last=Toothman|first=Jessika|date=|website=HowStuffWorks|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The processing (e.g. incineration and acid treatments) required to reclaim these precious substances may release, generate, or synthesize toxic byproducts.

Export of waste to countries with lower environmental standards is a major concern.  The [[Basel Convention]] includes hazardous wastes such as, but not limited to, CRT screens as an item that may not be exported transcontinentally without prior consent of both the country exporting and receiving the waste.  Companies may find it cost-effective in the short term to sell outdated computers to less developed countries with lax regulations. It is commonly believed that a majority of surplus laptops are routed to [[developing nation]]s.&lt;ref name="tmc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://green.tmcnet.com/topics/green/articles/37567-cash-laptops-offers-green-solution-broken-outdated-computers.htm|title=Cash For Laptops Offers 'Green' Solution for Broken or Outdated Computers|author=Prashant, Nitya|date=2008-08-20|work=Green Technology|accessdate=2009-03-17|publisher=[[Technology Marketing Corporation]]|location=[[Norwalk, Connecticut]]}} In {{cite news|url=http://www.electronicsrecycling.org/public/NewsletterViewer.aspx?message=sent&amp;id=40|title=Opinion|date=2008-08-28|work=National Center For Electronics Recycling News Summary|accessdate=2009-03-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726022111/http://www.electronicsrecycling.org/public/NewsletterViewer.aspx?message=sent&amp;id=40|archivedate=2011-07-26|deadurl=yes|publisher=National Center For Electronics Recycling|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high value of working and reusable laptops, computers, and components (e.g. [[RAM]]) can help pay the cost of transportation for many worthless commodities.{{clarify|date=October 2017}} Laws governing the exportation of waste electronics are put in place to govern recycling companies in developed countries which ship waste to Third World countries. However, concerns about the impact of e-recycling on human health, the health of recycling  workers and environmental degradation remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bakhiyi|first=Bouchra|last2=Gravel|first2=Sabrina|last3=Ceballos|first3=Diana|last4=Flynn|first4=Michael A.|last5=Zayed|first5=Joseph|title=Has the question of e-waste opened a Pandora's box?

Other procedures include burning away wire insulation and acid baths to resell circuit boards. These methods pose environmental and health hazards, as toxins are released into the air and acid bath residue can enter the water supply.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Regulations==
[[Image:Monitor in gutter.jpg|thumb|An abandoned Taxan [[computer display|monitor]].]]

===Europe===
In [[Switzerland]], the first [[electronic waste]] recycling system was implemented in 1991, beginning with collection of old refrigerators; over the years, all other electric and electronic devices were gradually added to the system. The established producer responsibility organization is SWICO, mainly handling information, communication, and organization technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bafu.admin.ch/abfall/01472/01478/?lang=en|title=Umwelt Schweiz, Electrical and electronic equipment|accessdate=2006-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] implemented a similar system in February 2003, under the [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] (WEEE Directive, 2002/96/EC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:037:0024:0038:EN:PDF|title=Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pan European adoption of the Legislation was slow on take-up, with Italy and the United Kingdom being the final member states to pass it into law.  The success of the WEEE directive has varied significantly from state to state, with collection rates varying between 13 kilograms per capita per annum to as little as 1&amp;nbsp;kg per capita per annum.  Computers &amp; electronic wastes collected from households within Europe are treated under the WEEE directive via Producer Compliance Schemes (whereby manufacturers of Electronics pay into a scheme that funds its recovery from household waste recycling centres (HWRCs)) and nominated Waste Treatment Facilities (known as Obligated WEEE).

However, recycling of ex corporate Computer Hardware and associated electronic equipment falls outside the Producer Compliance Scheme (Known as non-obligated).  In the UK, Waste or obsolete corporate related computer hardware is treated via third party Authorized Treatment Facilities, who normally impose a charge for its collection and treatment.

===United States===

====Federal====
The [[United States Congress]] considers a number of electronic waste bills, like the [[National Computer Recycling Act]] introduced by Congressman [[Mike Thompson (California politician)|Mike Thompson]] (D-CA). The main federal law governing solid waste is the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] of 1976. It covers only CRTs, though state regulations may differ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/hazwaste/recycle/electron/crt.htm|title=Final Rules on Cathode Ray Tubes and Discarded Mercury-Containing Equipment|publisher=[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also separate [[Battery (electricity)#Toxic hazards, regulations, and recycling|laws concerning battery disposal]]. On March 25, 2009, the House Science and Technology Committee approved funding for research on reducing electronic waste and mitigating environmental impact, regarded by sponsor [[Ralph Hall]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Texas|TX]]) as the first federal bill to directly address electronic waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=cqmidday-000003084555 |title=House Panel Approves Bill to Aid Disposal of Unwanted Electronics |work=[[Congressional Quarterly]] |date=2009-03-25 |accessdate=2009-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330220509/http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=cqmidday-000003084555 |archivedate=2009-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State====
Many states have introduced legislation concerning recycling and reuse of computers or computer parts or other electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsl.org/programs/environ/cleanup/elecwaste.htm|archive-url=https://archive.is/20050216154916/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/environ/cleanup/elecwaste.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-02-16|title=Electronic Waste}} &lt;/ref&gt; Most [[electronic waste#State|American computer recycling legislations]] address it from within the larger electronic waste issue.

In 2001, Arkansas enacted the Arkansas Computer and Electronic Solid Waste Management Act, which requires that state agencies manage and sell surplus computer equipment, establishes a computer and electronics recycling fund, and authorizes the Department of Environmental Quality to regulate and/or ban the disposal of computer and electronic equipment in Arkansas landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/ftproot/acts/2001/htm/act1410.pdf |title=Arkansas Computer and Electronic Solid Waste Management Act |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214204212/http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/ftproot/acts/2001/htm/act1410.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recently{{when|date=January 2011}} passed [[Electronic Device Recycling Research and Development Act]] distributes grants to universities, government labs and private industries for research in developing projects in line with e-waste recycling and refurbishment.

===Asia===
In [[Japan]], sellers and manufacturers of certain electronics (such as televisions and [[air conditioners]]) are required to recycle them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A comparative study of e-waste recycling systems|url=http://www.ide.go.jp/English/Publish/Download/Spot/pdf/30/007.pdf|publisher=Sun-Woo Chung &amp; Rei Murakama-Suzuki}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is covered by at least two legislations: the Law for the Promotion of Effective Utilization of Resources (LPUR); and, the Law for the Recycling of Specified Kinds of Home Appliances (LRHA). The former, which was passed in 2001, encouraged manufacturers to voluntarily help recycle goods while the LRHA, which was adopted in 2009, required more recycling efforts by both consumers and manufacturers of home appliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Japanese Business, 2nd ed.|last=Picken|first=Stuart|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2016|isbn=9781442255883|location=Lanham, MD|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no legislation exists to cover the recycling of computer or cellphone-related wastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnngo.com/tokyo/shop/urban-mining-finding-value-amongst-old-electronics-464333 |title=Recycling electronic waste in Japan: Better late than never |accessdate=7 April 2012 |date=17 September 2010 |publisher=CNN |author=Tim Hornyak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is required in [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]] that sellers and manufacturers of electronics be responsible for recycling 75%&lt;!-- percentage needs verification --&gt; of their used products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Earth's Garbage Crisis|last=Dorion|first=Christiane|publisher=Gareth Stevens Publishing LLLP|year=2007|isbn=9780836877533|location=Milwaukee|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Korea, some local governments have introduced recycling initiatives such as the case of [[Seoul]], which launched its specialized e-waste recycling program. This includes the SR Center recycling facility, which takes apart and salvages materials from a fifth of the 10-ton e-waste that the city generates each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-launches-initiative-recycle-ewaste/2497782.html|title=South Korea Launches Initiative to Recycle More E-Waste|last=Strother|first=Jason|work=VOA|access-date=2018-09-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by UNEP titled, "Recycling – from E-Waste to Resources," the amount of e-waste being produced – including mobile phones and computers – could rise by as much as 500 percent over the next decade in some countries, such as India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.busmanagementme.com/news/global-e-waste/|title=The global E-Waste Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One theory is that increased regulation of electronic waste and concern over the environmental harm in mature economies creates an economic disincentive to remove residues prior to export.  Critics of trade in used electronics maintain that it is too easy for brokers calling themselves recyclers to export unscreened electronic waste to developing countries, such as China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/2006/04/10/ewaste/ |title=Where computers go to die – and kill |date=10 April 2006 |publisher=Salon.com |accessdate=7 April 2012 |author=Elizabeth Grossman}}&lt;/ref&gt; India and parts of Africa, thus avoiding the expense of removing items like bad cathode ray tubes (the processing of which is expensive and difficult). The developing countries are becoming big dump yards of e-waste.  Proponents of international trade point to the success of [[fair trade]] programs in other industries, where cooperation has led creation of sustainable jobs, and can bring affordable technology in countries where repair and reuse rates are higher.

Organizations like [[A2Z Group]] have stepped in to own up the responsibility to collect and recycle e-waste at various locations in India.

Thanks to the National Environmental Management Act 1998 and National Environmental Management Waste Act 2008, any person in any position causing harm to the environment and failing to comply with the Waste Act could be fined R10 Million or put into jail or receive both penalties for their transgressions.

==Recycling methods==
[[Image:Computer Recycling.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Computers being collected for recycling at a pickup event in [[Olympia, Washington]], United States.]]

===Consumer recycling===
Consumer recycling options consists of (see below) sale, donating computers directly to organizations in need, sending devices directly back to their original manufacturers, or getting components to a convenient recycler or refurbisher.

===Scrapping/recycling===
The rising price of precious metals — coupled with the high rate of unemployment during the [[Great Recession]] — has led to a larger number of amateur "for profit" electronics recyclers. Computer parts, for example, are stripped of their most valuable components and sold for scrap. Metals like [[copper]], [[aluminium]], [[lead]], [[gold]] and  [[palladium]] are recovered from computers, televisions and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scrapmetaljunkie.com/251/how-to-scrap-apart-a-computer-2|title=How To Scrap Apart a Computer|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scrapmetaljunkie.com/775/scrap-television-and-scrap-tv|title=How To Scrap A Television|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the recycling process, TVs, monitors, mobile phones and computers are typically tested for reuse and repaired. If broken, they may be disassembled for parts still having high value if labour is cheap enough. Other e-waste is shredded to roughly 100&amp;nbsp;mm pieces and manually checked to separate out toxic batteries and [[capacitor]]s which contain poisonous metals. The remaining pieces are further shredded to ~10&amp;nbsp;mm and passed under a magnet to remove ferrous metals. An [[eddy current]] ejects non-ferrous metals, which are sorted by density either by a centrifuge or vibrating plates. Precious metals can be dissolved in acid, sorted, and smelted into ingots. The remaining glass and plastic fractions are separated by density and sold to re-processors. TVs and monitors must be manually disassembled to remove either toxic lead in CRTs or the mercury in flat screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/homehazwaste/Events/AnnualConf/2006/April27/Session4/CompRecTH.pdf|title=The Anatomy of a Computer Recycling Process|last=Hogye|first=Thomas Q.|accessdate=2016-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sweeepkuusakoski.co.uk/resources/bbc.php|title=Sweeep Kuusakoski – Resources – BBC Documentary|website=www.sweeepkuusakoski.co.uk|accessdate=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sweeepkuusakoski.co.uk/glassrecycling/furness.php|title=Sweeep Kuusakoski – Glass Recycling – BBC filming of CRT furnace|website=www.sweeepkuusakoski.co.uk|accessdate=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations face risks both for incompletely destroyed data and for improperly disposed computers. In the UK, some recycling companies use a specialized WEEE-registered contractor to dispose IT equipment and electrical appliances, who disposes it safely and legally.
In America, companies are liable for compliance with regulations even if the recycling process is outsourced under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Companies can mitigate these risks by requiring waivers of liability, audit trails, certificates of data destruction, signed confidentiality agreements, and random audits of information security. The National Association of Information Destruction is an international trade association for data destruction providers.&lt;ref name="abj"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://southflorida.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2006/06/12/focus3.html|title=Law holds businesses responsible for disposal of computers|author=Kuhlenbeck, Phil|date=2006-06-09|work=[[Austin Business Journal]]|accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sale===
Online auctions are an alternative for consumers willing to resell for cash less fees, in a complicated, self-managed, competitive environment&lt;ref name="cad"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ambosmedios.com/ebooknews/computermacintosh_2008-09-29_digest.pdf|title=Brisk sales of Apple's new 3G model have consumers scrambling to profit from their 'old' phones at Cashforiphones.com|author=Perepelkin, Plato|date=2008-09-18|work=Computer Apple Digest|accessdate=2009-03-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320074630/http://www.ambosmedios.com/ebooknews/computermacintosh_2008-09-29_digest.pdf|archive-date=2009-03-20|dead-url=yes|pages=16–18|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; where paid listings might not sell.&lt;ref name="pcm"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2326527,00.asp|title=Gazelle Will Give You Cash for Your Gadgets|author=Albanesius, Chloe|date=2008-07-28|work=News and Analysis|accessdate=2009-03-05|publisher=[[PC Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online classified ads can be similarly risky due to [[forgery]] scams and uncertainty.&lt;ref name="boston"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2008/10/30/scrounge_up_cash_with_used_gadgets/|title=Scrounge up cash with used gadgets|author=Bray, Hiawatha|date=2008-10-30|work=[[Boston Globe]]|publisher=Globe Newspaper Company|accessdate=2009-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Take back===
When researching computer companies before a computer purchase, consumers can find out if they offer recycling services. Most major computer manufacturers offer some form of recycling. At the user's request they may mail in their old computers, or arrange for pickup from the manufacturer.

[[Hewlett-Packard]] also offers free recycling, but only one of its "national" recycling programs is available nationally, rather than in one or two specific states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/globalcitizenship/environment/recycle/index.html|title=HP Environment: Product Return &amp; Recycling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hewlett-Packard also offers to pick up any computer product of any brand for a fee, and to offer a coupon against the purchase of future computers or components; it was the largest computer recycler in America in 2003, and it has recycled over {{convert|750000000|lb|kg}} of electronic waste globally&lt;ref name=sb/&gt; since 1995.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-22405423_ITM|title=Recycling, the Hewlett-Packard Way|author=Haffenreffer, David|date=2003-02-13|work=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=2009-03-17|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; It encourages the shared approach of collection points for consumers and recyclers to meet.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2003/06/59372|title=Bill Aims to Cut Computer Clutter|author=Dean, Katie|date=2003-06-25|work=[[Wired Magazine]]|accessdate=2009-03-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090729085149/http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2003/06/59372|archivedate=2009-07-29|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exchange===
Manufacturers often offer a free replacement service when purchasing a new PC. [[Dell Computers]] and [[Apple Inc.]] take back old products when one buys a new one. Both refurbish and resell their own computers with a one-year warranty.&lt;ref name="boston" /&gt;

Many companies purchase and recycle all brands of working and broken [[laptop]]s and [[notebook computer]]s from individuals and corporations. Building a market for recycling of desktop computers has proven more difficult than exchange programs for laptops,  [[smartphone]]s and other smaller electronics.&lt;ref name="nnbw"&gt;{{cite journal|author=NNBW Staff|date=2009-03-30|title=Cash-strapped consumers turn to laptops recycler|url=http://www.nnbw.biz/ArticleRead.aspx?storyID=12872|volume=7|issue=34|accessdate=2009-04-13|work=[[Northern Nevada Business Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A basic business model is to provide a seller an instant online quote based on laptop characteristics, then to send a shipping label and prepaid box to the seller, to erase, reformat, and process the laptop, and to pay rapidly by cheque.&lt;ref name="tmc" /&gt; A majority of these companies are also generalized [[electronic waste recyclers]] as well; organizations that recycle computers exclusively include [[Cash For Laptops]], a laptop refurbisher in [[Nevada]] that claims to be the first to buy laptops online, in 2001.&lt;ref name=nnbw/&gt;

===Donations/nonprofits===
With the constant rising costs due to inflation, many families or schools do not have the sufficient funds available for computers to be utilized along with education standards. Families also impacted by disaster suffer as well due to the financial impact of the situation they have incurred. Many nonprofit organizations, such as [[InterConnection.org]], can be found locally as well as around the web and give detailed descriptions as to what methods are used for dissemination and detailed instructions on how to donate. The impact can be seen locally and globally, affecting thousands of those in need. In Canada  non profit organizations engaged in computer recycling, such as The Electronic Recycling Association Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.era.ca The Electronic Recycling Association is doing computer recycling in Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Vancouver], retrieved 19 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Computers for Schools Canada wide,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cfs-ope.nsf/eng/home Anyone can give to Computers for Schools.], retrieved 19 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; are very active in collecting and refurbishing computers and laptops to help the non profit and charitable sectors and schools.

=== Junkyard Computing ===
The term ''junkyard computing'' is a colloquial expression for using old or inferior hardware to fulfill computational tasks while handling reliability and availability on software level. It utilizes abstraction of computational resources via software, allowing hardware replacement at very low effort. Ease of replacement is hereby a corner point since hardware failures are expected at any time due to the condition of the underlying infrastructure. This paradigm became more widely used with the introduction of cluster orchestration software like [[Kubernetes]] or [[Apache Mesos]], since large monolithic applications require reliability and availability on machine level whereas this kind of software is fault tolerant by design. Those orchestration tools also introduced fairly fast set-up processes allowing to use junkyard computing economically and even making this pattern applicable in the first place. Further use cases were introduced when [[continuous delivery]] was getting more widely accepted. Infrastructure to execute [[Unit testing|tests]] and [[Static program analysis|static code analysis]] was needed which requires as much performance as possible while being extremely cost effective. From an economical and technological perspective, junkyard computing is only practicable for a small amount of users or companies. It already requires a decent amount of physical machines to compensate hardware failures while maintaining the required reliability and availability. This implies a direct need for a matching underling infrastructure to house all the computers and servers. Scaling this paradigm is also quite limited due to the increasing importance of factors like power efficiency and maintenance efforts, making this kind of computing perfect for mid-sized applications.

==History==
Although consumer electronics such as the radio have been popular since the 1920s, recycling was almost unheard of until the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crc.org/about/crc_history.php|title=CRC History – Computer Recycling Center|website=www.crc.org|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 1970s the accelerating pace of domestic consumer electronics drastically shortened the lifespan of electronics such as TVs, VCRs and audio. New innovations appeared more quickly, making older equipment considered obsolete. Increased complexity and sophistication of manufacture made local repair more difficult. The retail market shifted gradually, but substantially from a few high-value items that were cherished for years and repaired when necessary, to short-lived items that were rapidly replaced owing to wear or simply fashion, and discarded rather than repaired. This was particularly evident in computing, highlighted by [[Moore's Law]]. In 1988 two severe incidents highlighted the approaching e-waste crisis. The cargo barge [[Khian Sea waste disposal incident|Khian Sea]], was loaded with more than 14,000 tons of toxic ash from [[Pennsylvania]] which had been refused acceptance in [[New Jersey]] and [[Caribbean|the Caribbean]]. After sailing for 16 months, all the waste was dumped as "topsoil fertiliser" in Haiti and in the [[Bay of Bengal]] by November 1988. In June 1988, a large illegal toxic waste dump which had been created by an Italian company was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu/annlsurvey/vol15/iss1/2/|title="Two Decades After the Koko Incident" by Dr. S. Gozie Ogbodo|website=digitalcommons.law.ggu.edu|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the formation of the [[Basel Convention]] to stem the flow of poisonous substances from developed countries in  1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.e-wastedmovie.com/index.php/e-wasted-timeline.html|title=E-Wasted Timeline|website=www.e-wastedmovie.com|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the first electronic waste recycling system was implemented in Switzerland, beginning with collection of old refrigerators but gradually expanding to cover all devices. The organisation SWICO handles the programme, and is a partnership between IT retailers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swicorecycling.ch/en/about-us/|title=About us – Swico Recycling|website=www.swicorecycling.ch|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first publication to report the recycling of computers and electronic waste was published on the front page of the New York Times on April 14, 1993 by columnist Steve Lohr. It detailed the work of Advanced Recovery Inc., a small recycler, in trying to safely dismantle computers, even if most waste was landfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/14/business/recycling-answer-sought-for-computer-junk.html|title=Recycling Answer Sought for Computer Junk|last=Lohr|first=Steve|date=1993-04-14|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2015-07-29|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other companies emerged in the early 1990s, chiefly in Europe, where national 'take back' laws compelled retailers to use them.

After these schemes were set up, many countries did not have the capacity to deal with the sheer quantity of e-waste they generated or its hazardous nature. They began to export the problem to developing countries without enforced environmental legislation. This is cheaper: the cost of recycling of computer monitors in the US is ten times more than in China. Demand in Asia for electronic waste began to grow when scrap yards found they could extract valuable substances such as copper, iron, silicon, nickel and gold, during the recycling process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/detox/electronics/the-e-waste-problem/where-does-e-waste-end-up/|title=Where does e-waste end up?|date=24 February 2009|website=www.greenpeace.org/|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) became European Law in February 2003 and covers all aspects of recycling all types of appliance. This was followed by Electronic Waste Recycling Act, enshrined in Californian law in January 2005

The 2000s saw a large increase in both the sale of electronic devices and their growth as a waste stream: in 2002 e-waste grew faster than any other type of waste in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6254816.stm|title=Mechanics of e-waste recycling|last=Kinver|first=Mark|date=2007-07-03|access-date=2015-07-29|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused investment in modern, automated facilities to cope with the influx of redundant appliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ask-eu.com/Default.asp?Menue=142&amp;Bereich=5&amp;SubBereich=16&amp;KW=130&amp;NewsPPV=8492|title=Bulgaria opens largest WEEE recycling factory in Eastern Europe|last=|date=12 Jul 2010|website=www.ask-eu.com|publisher=WtERT Germany GmbH|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/environcom-opens-largest-weee-recycling-facility-in-uk-1195.aspx|title=EnvironCom opens largest WEEE recycling facility / waste &amp; recycling news|date=4 March 2010|website=www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk|publisher=The Sixty Mile Publishing Company|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928172233/http://greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/environcom-opens-largest-weee-recycling-facility-in-uk-1195.aspx|archive-date=28 September 2010|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/11/e-waste-recycling-las-vegas-us-micro-electronics_n_1200527.html|title=Where Gadgets Go To Die: E-Waste Recycler Opens New Plant In Las Vegas|last=Goodman|first=Peter S.|date=11 Jan 2012|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/biztech/new-plant-tackles-our-electronic-leftovers/2008/11/19/1226770518649.html|title=New plant tackles our electronic leftovers – BizTech – Technology – smh.com.au|last=Moses|first=Asher|date=19 Nov 2008|website=www.smh.com.au|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===E-cycling===
"E-cycling" or "E-waste" is an initiative by the United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) which refers to donations, reuse, shredding and general collection of used electronics. Generically, the term refers to the process of collecting, brokering, disassembling, repairing and recycling the components or metals contained in used or discarded electronic equipment, otherwise known as [[electronic waste]] (e-waste). "E-cyclable" items include, but are not limited to: televisions, computers, microwave ovens, vacuum cleaners, telephones and cellular phones, stereos, and VCRs and DVDs just about anything that has a cord, light or takes some kind of battery.

Investment in e-cycling facilities has been increasing recently due to technology’s rapid rate of obsolescence, concern over improper methods, and opportunities for manufacturers to influence the secondary market (used and reused products). The higher metal prices is also having more recycling taking place. The controversy around methods stems from a lack of agreement over preferred outcomes.

World markets with lower disposable incomes, consider 75% repair and reuse to be valuable enough to justify 25% disposal. Debate and certification standards may be leading to better definitions, though civil law contracts, governing the expected process are still vital to any contracted process, as poorly defined as "e-cycling".

====Pros of e-cycling====
The e-waste disposal occurring after processing for reuse, repair of equipment, and recovery of metals may be unethical or illegal when e-scrap of many kinds is transported overseas to developing countries for such processing. It is transported as if to be repaired and/or recycled, but after processing the less valuable e-scrap becomes e-waste/pollution there. Another point of view is that the net environmental cost must be compared to and include the mining, refining and extraction with its waste and pollution cost of new products manufactured to replace secondary products which are routinely destroyed in wealthier nations, and which cannot economically be repaired in older or obsolete products.  As an example of negative impacts of e-waste, pollution of groundwater has become so serious in areas surrounding China’s landfills that water must be shipped in from {{convert|18|mi}} away.&lt;ref name="ethicalshopping"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethicalshopping.com/electronics/cell-phones-service/most-u-s-electronic-waste-pollution-and-worker-danger-shipped-overse|title=Most U.S. Electronic Waste is Pollution-and-Worker-Danger Shipped Overseas|date=19 November 2007|publisher=Ethical Shopping|accessdate=29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, mining of new metals can have even broader impacts on groundwater. Either thorough e-cycling processing, domestic processing or overseas repair, can help the environment by avoiding pollution. Such e-cycling can theoretically be a sustainable alternative to disposing of e-waste in landfills. In addition, e-cycling allows for the reclamation of potential [[conflict minerals]], like [[gold]] and [[wolframite]], which requires less of those to be mined and lessens the potential money flow to militias and other exploitative actors in third-world that profit from mining them.

Supporters of one form of "required e-cycling" legislation argue that e-cycling saves taxpayers money,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=About the Campaign|url=http://www.computertakeback.com/about/index.cfm|publisher=Computer TakeBack Campaign|accessdate=28 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the financial responsibility would be shifted from the taxpayer to the manufacturers. Advocates of more simple legislation (such as landfill bans for e-waste) argue that involving manufacturers does not reduce the cost to consumers, if reuse value is lost, and the resulting costs are then passed on to consumers in new products, particularly affecting markets which can hardly afford new products. It is theorized that manufacturers who take part in e-cycling would be motivated to use fewer materials in the production process, create longer lasting products, and implement safer, more efficient recycling systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svtc.org/svtc_work|title=Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition|accessdate=30 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is sharply disputed and has never been demonstrated.

====Criticisms of e-cycling====
The critics of e-cycling are just as vocal as its advocates. According to the [[Reason Foundation]], e-cycling only raises the product and waste management costs of e-waste for consumers and limits innovation on the part of high-tech companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.org/news/show/e-waste-politics|title=E-Waste Politics|date=4 October 2000|publisher=Scarlett, Lynn – Reason Foundation|accessdate=23 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also believe that e-cycling facilities could unintentionally cause great harm to the environment. Critics claim that e-waste doesn’t occupy a significant portion of total waste. According to a European study, only 4% of waste is electronic.

Another opposition to e-cycling is that many problems are posed in disassembly: the process is costly and dangerous because of the heavy metals of which the electronic products are composed, and as little as 1–5% of the original cost of materials can be retrieved. A final problem that people find is that [[identity fraud]] is all too common in regards to the disposal of electronic products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eiae.org/why.php|title=The Importance of Responsible Recycling for Used Electronics|year=2007|publisher=Electronic Industries Alliance|accessdate=29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the programs are legislated, creating winners and losers among e-cyclers with different locations and processes, it may be difficult to distinguish between criticism of e-cycling as a practice, and criticism of the specific legislated means proposed to enhance it.

====The fate of e-waste====
A hefty criticism often lobbed at reuse based recyclers is that people think that they are recycling their electronic waste, when in reality it is actually being exported to developing countries like China, India, and Nigeria.  For instance, at free recycling drives, "recyclers" may not be staying true to their word, but selling e-waste overseas&lt;ref name="ethicalshopping" /&gt; or to parts brokers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2002/02/25/computer-waste.htm|title=Much toxic computer waste lands in Third World|date=25 February 2002|accessdate=27 September 2007|publisher=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies indicate that 50–80% of the 300,000 to 400,000 tons (270,000 to 360,000 tonnes) of e-waste is being sent overseas, and that approximately 2 million tons (1.8 million tonnes) per year go to U.S. landfills.&lt;ref name="ethicalshopping" /&gt;

Although not possible in all circumstances, the best way to e-cycle is to upcycle e-waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fourgreensteps.com/infozone/featured/features/what-is-e-waste-a-how-can-i-get-rid-of-it|title=What is 'E-Waste' &amp; How Can I Get Rid Of It?!|author=Melanie Kozlan|date=2 November 2010|publisher=[[Four Green Steps]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130085009/http://www.fourgreensteps.com/infozone/featured/features/what-is-e-waste-a-how-can-i-get-rid-of-it|archive-date=30 November 2010|dead-url=yes|accessdate=4 November 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the electronic products in question are generally manufactured, and repaired under warranty, in the same nations, which anti-reuse recyclers depict as primitive. Reuse-based e-recyclers believe that fair-trade incentives for export markets will lead to better results than domestic shredding. There has been a continued debate between export-friendly e-cycling and increased regulation of that practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.discovery.com/tech/revenge-of-the-tv-monitor-zombies.html|title=Revenge of the TV Monitor Zombies|date=30 July 2010|accessdate=8 January 2011|publisher=Discovery News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European Union, debate regarding the export of e-waste has resulted in a significant amendment to the WEEE directive (January 2012) with a view to significantly diminishing the export of WEEE (untreated e-waste).  During debate in Strasburg, MEPs stated that "53 million tonnes of WEEE were generated in 2009 but only 18% collected for recycling"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.it-green.co.uk/uk_business_recycling/what-the-recast-weee-directive-means-for-the-uk/|title=What the Recast WEEE Directive means for the UK|publisher=IT-Green|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the remainder being exported or sent to landfill. The Amendment, voted through by a unanimous 95% of representatives, removed the re-use (repair and refurbishmet) aspect of the directive and placed more emphasis upon recycling and recovery of precious metals and base metals.  The changes went further by placing the burden upon registered exporters to prove that used equipment leaving Europe was "fit for purpose".

====Policy issues and current efforts====
Currently, pieces of government legislation and a number of grassroots efforts have contributed to the growth of e-cycling processes which emphasize decreased exports over increased reuse rates. The [[California Electronic Waste Recycling Act|Electronic Waste Recycling Act]] was passed in California in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciwmb.ca.gov/Electronics/Act2003/|title=Electronic Waste Recycling Act of 2003: Covered Electronic Waste Payment System (SB 20/SB 50)|date=1 November 2007|publisher=California Integrated Waste Management Board|accessdate=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires that consumers pay an extra fee for certain types of electronics, and the collected money be then redistributed to recycling companies that are qualified to properly recycle these products. It is the only state that legislates against e-waste through this kind of consumer fee; the other states' efforts focus on producer responsibility laws or waste disposal bans. No study has shown that per capita recovery is greater in one type of legislated program (e.g. California) versus ordinary waste disposal bans (e.g. Massachusetts), though recovery has greatly increased in states which use either method.
  
As of September, 2006, Dell developed the nation’s first completely free recycling program,&lt;ref name="csmonitor1"&gt;Moore, Elizabeth Armstrong. "Momentum Builds for 'Revolution' to Recycle Electronic Waste." 31 July 2006. The Christian Science Monitor. Accessed 29 November 2007. [http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0731/p13s02-stct.html].&lt;/ref&gt; furthering the responsibilities that manufacturers are taking for e-cycling. Manufacturers and retailers such as Best Buy, Sony, and Samsung have also set up recycling programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Help File: Recycling Old Electronics|date=5 July 2009|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/03/AR2009070302635.html?hpid=sec-tech|author=Rob Pegoraro|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This program does not accept televisions, which are the most expensive used electronic item, and are unpopular in markets which must deal with televisions when the more valuable computers have been cherry picked.

Another step being taken is the recyclers’ pledge of true stewardship, sponsored by the Computer TakeBack Campaign. It has been signed by numerous recyclers promising to recycle responsibly. Grassroots efforts have also played a big part in this issue, as they and other community organizations are being formed to help responsibly recycle e-waste.&lt;ref name="csmonitor1" /&gt; Other grassroots campaigns are Basel, the Computer TakeBack Campaign (co-coordinated by the Grassroots Recycling Network), and the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition. No study has shown any difference in recycling methods under the Pledge, and no data is available to demonstrate difference in management between "Pledge" and non-Pledge companies, though it is assumed that the risk of making false claims will prevent Pledge companies from wrongly describing their processes.

Many people believe that the U.S. should follow the European Union model in regards to its management of e-waste. This refers to the concept of [[Extended producer responsibility|Extended Producer Responsibility,]] which was started in Sweden in 1990.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://recyclebc.ca/about-recyclebc/epr/|title=Extended Producer Responsibility in BC|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this program, a directive forces manufacturers to take responsibility for e-cycling; it also demands manufacturers' mandatory take-back and places bans on exporting e-waste to developing countries. British Columbia has more than 20 EPR programs under the Recycling Regulation legislation, which stops e-waste from being put into landfills and recycles them instead. There are more than 80 programs in Canada as of 2013.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another longer-term solution is for computers to be composed of less dangerous products and many people disagree. No data has been provided to show that people who agree with the European model have based their agreement on measured outcomes or experience-based scientific method.

==Data security==
[[File:Agbogbloshie.JPG|thumb|250px|Electronic waste dump at [[Agbogbloshie]], Ghana. Organized criminals commonly search the drives for information to use in local [[scams]].&lt;ref name="r4"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/ghana804/video/video_index.html "Africa’s Agbogbloshie Market Is a Computer Graveyard"] NewsBreakingOnline.com. Web. 20 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

E-waste presents a potential [[security]] threat to individuals and exporting countries. [[Hard drives]] that are not properly erased before the computer is disposed of can be reopened, exposing sensitive information. [[Credit card]] numbers, private financial data, account information and records of [[online]] transactions can be accessed by most willing individuals. Organized criminals in Ghana commonly search the drives for information to use in local [[scams]].&lt;ref name="r4"/&gt;

Government contracts have been discovered on hard drives found in [[Agbogbloshie]], Ghana. Multimillion-dollar agreements from United States security institutions such as the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), the [[Transportation Security Administration]] and [[Homeland Security]] have all resurfaced in Agbogbloshie.&lt;ref name="r4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="r13"&gt;Doctorow, Cory. [http://boingboing.net/2009/06/25/illegal-e-waste-dump.html "Illegal E-waste Dumped in Ghana Includes Unencrypted Hard Drives Full of US Security Secrets."] Boing Boing. 25 June 2009. Web. 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons to destroy and recycle securely===
There are ways to ensure that not only hardware is destroyed but also the private data on the hard drive. Having customer data stolen, lost, or misplaced contributes to the ever-growing number of people who are affected by [[identity theft]], which can cause corporations to lose more than just money. The image of a company that holds secure data, such as banks, law firms, pharmaceuticals, and credit corporations is also at risk. If a company's public image is hurt, it could cause consumers to not use their services and could cost millions in business losses and positive public relation campaigns. The cost of data breaches "varies widely, ranging from $90 to $50,000 (under HIPAA's new HITECH amendment, that came about through the American Recovery and Revitalization act of 2009), as per customer record, depending on whether the breach is “low-profile” or “high-profile” and the company is in a non-regulated or highly regulated area, such as banking or medical institutions.”&lt;ref name="infosec"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.idtheftcenter.org/workplace_facts.html|title=ID Theft Center|date=2009-01-01|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a major backlash from the consumer if there is a data breach in a company that is supposed to be trusted to protect their private information. If an organization has any consumer info on file, they must by law (Red Flags Clarification act of 2010) have written information protection policies and procedures in place, that serve to combat, mitigate, and detect vulnerable areas that could result in identity theft. The United States Department of Defense has published a standard to which recyclers and individuals may meet in order to satisfy HIPAA requirements.

===Secure recycling===
Countries have developed standards, aimed at businesses and with the purpose of ensuring the security of Data contained in 'confidential' computer media [NIST 800-88: US standard for Data Remenance][HMG CESG IS5, Baseline &amp; Enhanced, UK Government Protocol for Data Destruction]. National Association for Information Destruction (NAID) "is the international trade association for companies providing information destruction services. Suppliers of products, equipment and services to destruction companies are also eligible for membership. NAID's mission is to promote the information destruction industry and the standards and ethics of its member companies." &lt;ref name="naid"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.naidonline.org/|title=NAID|date=2009-01-01|accessdate=2009-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are companies that follow the guidelines from NAID and also meet all Federal EPA and local DEP regulations.

The typical process for computer recycling aims to securely destroy hard drives while still recycling the  byproduct. A typical process for effective computer recycling:

#Receive hardware for destruction in locked and securely transported vehicles.
#Shred hard drives.
#Separate all aluminum from the waste metals with an electromagnet.
#Collect and securely deliver the shredded remains to an aluminum recycling plant.
#Mold the remaining hard drive parts into aluminum ingots.

The [[Asset Disposal and Information Security Alliance]] (ADISA) publishes an ''ADISA IT Asset Disposal Security Standard'' that covers all phases of the e-waste disposal process from collection to transportation, storage and sanitization's at the disposal facility. It also conducts periodic audits of disposal vendors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adisa.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9332">{{about|the ancient Roman title|the Dutch foundation|De Consularis}}
'''''Consularis''''' is a [[Latin]] adjective indicating something pertaining to the [[Roman consul|consular office]]. In [[Ancient Rome]] it was a title given to those [[Roman Senate|senators]] who held consular rank, i.e. who had served as [[Roman consul|consuls]] or who had received the rank as a special honour. In [[Late Antiquity]], the title became also a gubernatorial rank for [[Roman province|provincial]] [[Roman governor|governors]].

==History==
In the [[Roman Republic]], the term ''[vir] consularis'' (rendered in Greek ὑπατικός, ''hypatikos'') as  originally designated any [[Roman Senate|senator]] who had served as [[Roman consul|consul]]. The distinction was accompanied by specific privileges and honours, and was a necessary qualification for a number of [[Roman magistrate|magistracies]]: the posts of ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'' and his deputy, the ''[[magister equitum]]'' (although some cases seem to refute that), the post of ''[[Roman censor|censor]]'' as well as the governance of certain [[Roman province|provinces]] as [[proconsuls]]. The distinction was attached to their wives as well (''consularis femina'', in Greek ὑπατική or ὑπάτισσα).&lt;ref name="PW"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Kübler | first = B. |title = Consularis | encyclopedia = [[Realencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft]] | volume = Band IV, Halbband 7, Claudius mons-Cornificius | year = 1900 | at=col. 1138–1142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status of a ''consularis'' could be gained without holding the consulship, either through the ''adlectio inter consulares'' or through the award of the consular insignia (''ornamenta/insignia consularia''), but this was done only twice under the late Republic, and only became common practice in the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt;

Under the Empire, a number of senior magistracies were created for ''consulares'':&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt;
* The position of ''[[praefectus urbi]]'', governor of [[Rome]] and its environs.
* Under [[Hadrian]] (r. 117–138), [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italy]] was divided into four judicial jurisdictions, each with a ''consularis'' at its head. This institution was abolished soon after Hadrian's death, however.
* Under [[Alexander Severus]] (r. 222–235), a council of fourteen ''consulares'', the ''consulares sacrae urbis'', was created to assist the ''praefectus urbi'', with each one representing one of the [[14 regions of Augustan Rome|fourteen regions]] of Rome.
* The ''consulares operum publicorum, alvei Tiberis et cloacarum'', public officials (''[[curator]]es'') responsible for public works, the regulation of the [[Tiber]] and the maintenance of [[Sanitation in ancient Rome|Rome's sanitation system]].

=== Provincial governors ===
Already in Republican times, certain provinces were reserved for ex-consuls. This tradition carried into the Empire following the division of the provinces into [[Imperial provinces|Imperial]] and [[Senatorial provinces|Senatorial]] in 27 BC. Of the latter, two were specifically reserved for ''consulares'', the proconsular provinces of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] and [[Africa proconsularis]].&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; ''Consulares'' could also hold office in Imperial provinces as the Emperor's delegates (''[[legatus Augusti pro praetore]]''), alongside senators who had not advanced beyond ''[[praetor]]'' rank or [[Equestrian order|equestrian]] governors, who were styled ''[[procurator (Roman)|procuratores]]''. There was no fixed system of appointment for the Imperial provinces, but those where more than one [[Roman legion|legion]] was garrisoned usually received a governor of consular rank.&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt;

As the formal title of ''legatus Augusti'' did not distinguish between holders of consular or praetorian rank, the former occasionally attached the form ''consularis'' to their title, a practice which became commonplace in the 3rd century. As a result, the latter, simpler title began to replace the formal title, and to acquire a generic meaning of "provincial governor".&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; This evolution was formalized in the reforms of [[Diocletian]] (r. 284–305) and [[Constantine the Great]] (r. 306–337). Aside from its traditional meaning, designating holders of consular rank, the term ''consularis'' now came to designate a class of provincial governors. Its holders outranked the ''[[corrector]]es'' and ''[[praeses|praesides]]'', but were still at the very bottom of the senatorial hierarchy, with the senatorial rank of ''[[vir clarissimus]]'', while a holder of consular rank was styled ''[[vir illustris]]''.&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; In a handful of cases, serving ''consulares'' were raised to proconsular rank, while [[Valentinian I]] (r. 364–375) and [[Valens]] (r. 364–378) gave the ''consulares'' of [[Numidia]] the exceptional right to be preceded by six instead of five ''[[fasces]]''-bearing ''[[lictor]]es''.&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt;

According to the ''[[Notitia Dignitatum]]'' (circa 400), the following provinces were administered by a ''consularis'':
; in fifteen provinces in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OriensI"&gt;''Notitia Dignitatum'', [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0212/_P17.HTM ''in partibus Orientis'', I]&lt;/ref&gt;
* five in the [[Diocese of the East]]: [[Palaestina Prima]], [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Phoenice]], [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria Prima]], [[Cilicia Prima]] and [[Cyprus]]
* three in the [[Diocese of Asia]]: [[Pamphylia]], [[Hellespontus (province)|Hellespontus]] and [[Lydia]]
* two in the [[Diocese of Pontus]]: [[Galatia]] and [[Bithynia]]
* two in the [[Diocese of Thrace]]: [[Europa (Roman province)|Europa]] and [[Thracia]]
* three in the [[Diocese of Illyricum]]: [[Creta]] (Crete), [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and [[Dacia Mediterranea]]
* the [[Diocese of Egypt (Late Antiquity)|Diocese of Egypt]]—''sui generis'' as the imperial crown domain—is explicitly said to have none

;in twenty-one provinces in the [[Western Roman Empire]]&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OccidensI"&gt;''Notitia Dignitatum'', [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0212/_P1.HTM ''in partibus Occidentis'', I]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* one in the [[Diocese of Pannonia]]: [[Pannonia Secunda]]
* eight in the two Italian dioceses: [[Venetia et Histria]], [[Aemilia (Roman province)|Aemilia]], [[Liguria (Roman province)|Liguria]], [[Flaminia et Picenum Annonarium]], [[Tuscia et Umbria]], [[Picenum Suburbicarium]], [[Campania (Roman province)|Campania]] and [[Sicilia]]
* two in the [[Diocese of Africa]]: [[Byzacena]] and Numidia
* three in the [[Diocese of Spain]]: [[Baetica]], [[Lusitania]], [[Gallaecia]]
* six in the [[Diocese of Gaul]]: [[Viennensis]], [[Gallia Lugdunensis|Lugdunensis Prima]], [[Germania Prima]], [[Germania Secunda]], [[Belgica Prima]] and [[Belgica Secunda]]
* two in the [[Diocese of Britain]]: [[Maxima Caesariensis]] and [[Valentia (Roman Britain)|Valentia]]

The ''Notitia'' gives the following staff (''[[officium (Ancient Rome)|officium]]'') for a ''consularis'' of the West: ''princeps officii'' (detached from the [[praetorian prefecture]]), a ''[[cornicularius]]'', two ''tabularii'', an ''adiutor'', a ''commentariensis'', an ''ab actis'', a ''subadiuva'', and various ''exceptores'' and ''cohortalini'', i.e. menial staff.&lt;ref&gt;''Notitia Dignitatum'', [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0212/_P14.HTM ''in partibus Occidentis'', XLIII]&lt;/ref&gt; For the East, the ''officium'' was slightly different: ''princeps officii'', ''cornicularius'', ''commentariensis'', ''adiutor'', ''numerarius'', ''ab actis'', ''a libellis'', and the usual ''exceptores'' and ''cohortalini''.&lt;ref&gt;''Notitia Dignitatum'', [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0212/_P28.HTM ''in partibus Orientis'', XLIII]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Synecdemus]]'', written some time shortly before 535, lists the following provinces under ''consulares'':&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; 
Europa, Thracia, Macedonia Prima, Creta, [[Epirus Nova]], Dacia Mediterranea, Hellespontus, [[Phrygia Pacatiana]] and [[Phrygia Salutaris]], Lydia, [[Pisidia]], [[Lycaonia]], Pamphylia, [[Lycia]], [[Caria]], Pontica Prima (Bithynia), Galatia, [[Cappadocia Prima]], [[Helenopontus]], Cilicia Prima, Cyprus, Syria Prima, Phoenice, Palaestina Prima, [[Arabia Petraea|Arabia]], and one whose name is illegible. 

Following the [[Vandalic War|reconquest]] of [[Roman North Africa|North Africa]], in 534, [[Tripolitania]] was given a ''consularis'', while Numidia was downgraded to a mere ''praeses''.&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt; However, in 535 Emperor [[Justinian I]] (r. 527–565) carried out a wide-ranging administrative reorganization. The provinces of [[Palaestina Secunda]], [[Syria Secunda]], [[Theodorias (province)|Theodorias]], [[Osrhoene]], [[Armenia Secunda]], [[Armenia Magna]], [[Cappadocia Secunda]], [[Rhodope (Roman province)|Rhodope]], [[Haemimontus]] and Augustamnica (this is possibly an error) were placed under ''consulares'', while Epirus Nova, Dacia Mediterranea, Phrygia Pacatiana, Galatia, Syria Prima and Arabia were placed under governors of other ranks.&lt;ref name="PW"/&gt;

'''Court uniform and dress''' were required to be worn by those in attendance at the royal Court in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

Specifically, ''court uniform'' was worn by those holding particular offices (e.g. in the government, the Civil Service, the Royal Household, etc.). A range of office-holders were entitled to wear it, with different grades of uniform specified for different grades of official. It is still worn today on state occasions by certain dignitaries both in the UK and abroad.&lt;ref name="mansfield"&gt;Mansfield, Alan, ''Ceremonial Costume''.

''Court dress'', on the other hand, is a stylized form of clothing deriving from fashionable eighteenth-century wear, which was directed to be worn at Court by those not entitled to a court uniform. For men, it comprises a matching [[tailcoat]] and [[waistcoat]], [[breeches]] and [[Stocking|stockings]], [[lace]] [[Cuff|cuffs]] and [[cravat]], [[cocked hat]] and a [[sword]]. For women, a white or cream [[Evening gown|evening dress]] is directed to be worn, together with a [[Train (clothing)|train]] and other specified [[accoutrements]]. Male court dress is still worn today as part of the formal dress of judges and [[Queen's Counsel]], and is also worn by certain [[Lord Mayor]]s, parliamentary officials, and [[high sheriff]]s of counties. Female court dress was at one time required wear for [[debutante]]s being presented at Court, but it ceased regularly to be worn after the [[World War II|Second World War]] (when afternoon presentations replaced evening Courts).&lt;ref name="mansfield" /&gt;

Precise descriptions, both of court uniform and of court dress, were laid down in an official publication called ''Dress Worn at Court'' (viewable online)&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/dressinsigniawor00greauoft#page/n37/mode/2up ''Dress worn at Court'', 1921 edition.]&lt;/ref&gt; which was published by the Lord Chamberlain's Office.&lt;ref name="dwc"&gt;''Dress and Insignia Worn at His Majesty's Court''. Various editions 1898-1937&lt;/ref&gt; The 1937 edition remains authoritative for those rare circumstances in which court uniform or court dress are still required.

== Men's court dress ==
[[File:Yarmouth Old Gaffers Festival 2012 opening ceremony 5.JPG|thumbnail|upright|left|A high sheriff in 2012 wearing court dress]]
Court dress (as distinguished from court uniform mentioned in the section below) was worn by all men not entitled to court uniform or military uniform on occasions of state where such were customarily worn. Such occasions are now rare, but formerly they included state balls, evening state parties, courts and levées (courts were evening occasions at which women were formally presented to the monarch; levées were morning gatherings at which men were presented). It is still worn today, to a very limited extent, in courts of law and by certain parliamentary and other office-holders; the last time it was worn by people in significant numbers was at the Coronation in 1953. It consists of a tail-coat with matching waistcoat and breeches, lace cuffs and jabot, silk stockings, buckled shoes, cocked hat, white gloves and a sword. At one time suits of various colours were to be seen, often with gold or silver embroidery; but (as is generally the case with men's formal dress) black is now the predominant colour, and has been since the nineteenth century.

===Origins and development===
Peers' robes were worn over normal dress, which gradually became stylised as the court suit. It was only from the late eighteenth century that court dress became fossilised. By the early to mid eighteenth century velvet was largely confined to court dress. Court dress was obligatory in [[Westminster Abbey]] for all not wearing official or lordly apparel.

During the seventeenth century, gentlemen's court dress was largely determined by two related influences, the retention of out-dated styles, producing a distinctive form of dress, and an interest in military uniform. The first produced the court suit, a coat with tails, waistcoat and knee breeches, worn with silk stockings, and a formal court sword with a cut-steel hilt and embellishments, and [[bicorne|bicorne hat]]. The court suit has undergone a number of changes since the eighteenth century. However, apart from changes in the cut of the sleeves and shoulders, there was little basic alteration until the third quarter of the nineteenth century.

[[File:BLW Man's Court Coat and Waistcoat.jpg|thumb|Man's court coat and waistcoat, c. 1800.  [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] T.29A&amp;10-1910]]
In the eighteenth century, dress worn at court comprised gold and silver stuff, brocades, velvets and cloth coats. They were always embroidered, and worn with waistcoats generally of a different colour- gold or silver brocade, damask, silk or satin, heavily embroidered or laced in silver or gold. From the 1730s at least cloth was popular for court wear. By the 1780s dress was established as dark cloth or velvet, embroidered in silk or metal, single-breasted silk waistcoat (usually white), with the fronts curved away.

===The 19th century===
From 1810, the [[Lord Chamberlain]] laid down regulations for court dress. In the nineteenth century court dress coats were commonly black, brown, dark green, purple, or blue. Breeches matched, or could be silk of a similar colour. The coat, and sometimes the breeches, were embroidered. The waistcoat was generally white satin, sometimes embroidered. These were worn with white silk stockings, black shoes with [[shoe buckle]]s, and sword. A wig-bag was found on the back of the neck. A crescent-shaped chapeau-bras, known as an opera-hat, developed in the 1760s-70s from the three-cornered hat. In the second decade of the nineteenth century, this hat became known simply as the cocked hat. In the 1830s-40s, the full court dress was sometimes decorated with embroidery, and sometimes not. Cloth was most general, but velvet was also used. For levées, cloth trousers were worn.

A new style of court dress, worn from the 1840s, comprised a dark, frequently black, cloth (or silk-velvet) single-breasted dress coat ([[lining (sewing)|lined]] with black silk, except for the tail, which was white), with a stand collar. This was worn with a white satin or black silk collarless waistcoat, and white neckcloth. For levées, this was worn with matching velvet trousers with a gold lace stripe down the seam. For drawing rooms matching breeches with white silk stockings, and a white neck-cloth was worn.

In 1869, the [[Lord Chamberlain]]'s Department issued new regulations for gentlemen at Court. The new style of suit was described, in which the cloth coat and breeches were replaced with silk velvet. This had been permitted before, but in place of the embroidered waistcoat was a waistcoat of plain white silk. A coat for levée dress had dark coloured cloth, single-breasted, with a stand collar, and trousers of the same material and colour as the coat, both decorated with narrow gold lace on collar, cuffs and pocket flaps, similar to that worn on certain classes of the civil uniform. A gold lace loop and button were similarly worn on the hat, and a sword of the same pattern carried.

In 1898, court dress was described as black (often very dark blue) velvet, or a dark colour cloth suit (not black). The velvet version in 1898 was without gold embroidery on the coat, and the buttons were gilt, steel or plain. The waistcoat was either black velvet, or the normal white one. Trousers were of velvet. Hats were as for the cloth version, that is beaver or silk cocked hat with black silk cockade, but the loop and buttons were gilt or steel, and there was no lace. The sword was gilt or steel with silk shoulder belt. A white neckcloth was worn. When breeches were worn they were black velvet with black silk hose. Gilt or steel buckled shoes were worn. The velvet suit was all black.&lt;ref name="dwc" /&gt; The cloth coat in 1898 had embroidery on collar, cuffs and pocket flaps, specified as similar to fifth-class civil uniform ({{convert|3/8|in|cm}}?). The buttons were convex gilt with mounted crown in relief. Gold lace striped trousers (for levée dress) or white breeches, black or white silk stockings, gilt buckled shoes, beaver or silk cocked hat with black silk cockade gold lace loop and buttons, sword same as civil, suspended by a silk shoulder belt worn underneath the waistcoat, white neck cloth.&lt;ref name="dwc" /&gt;

By the time ''Dress worn at Court'' was published, in 1898, regulations for three different varieties of court dress had been laid down: 'old style velvet', 'new style velvet' and 'cloth'. The velvet suits were in black and without embroidery; the cloth court suit ("for Courts and Evening Parties") ''is'' to have embroidery, and is to be "mulberry, claret or green - ''not'' blue or black".&lt;ref name="dwc" /&gt; (Legal and judicial cloth Court suits were black.) The most notable difference between the 'old style' and 'new style' suits is that the old style coat has a curved front and is worn with a lace jabot, whereas the new style coat is cut away at the waist and is worn with a white bow tie. In this, it will be seen that the new style is closer to what is nowadays known as '[[white tie|white tie &amp; tails]]' evening dress (which had begun to be fashionable in the nineteenth century, and which was itself given official status as 'Alternative Court Dress' in 1924).&lt;ref name="mansfield" /&gt;

====Old style velvet court dress====
In 1908, the old-style court suit was of velvet, with a cut-back frock style, single-breasted with seven buttons and button-holes, but the coat was actually fastened edge-to-edge on the chest by a hook and eye. There were six buttons at the back, two extra halfway down the tails. A black silk flash or wig-bag, and lace frill and ruffles were worn. A white satin or black silk waistcoat was worn, which was no longer to be embroidered (and has four small buttons). The breeches were black velvet, with three steel buttons and steel buckles at the knee. Black silk stockings, black patent leather shoes with steel buckles, black silk or beaver hat, steel hilt sword and black scabbard (belt under waistcoat) and white gloves completed the dress. At levées velvet trousers with patent leather military boots were worn.

In 1912, the old style pointed pocket flaps were to have three buttons (one under each point). The waistcoat has pointed pocket flaps and three buttons under each, skirted fronts. The sword is of sling type, with slings instead of a frog on the black silk waistband.&lt;ref name="dwc" /&gt;

====New style velvet court dress====
[[File:Sir Benjamin Stone's pictures; records of national life and history reproduced from the collection of photographs made by Sir Benjamin Stone, M.P (1906) (14592162328).jpg|thumb|upright|New style velvet court dress, {{circa|1906}}]]
By 1908, the new style court dress was described as being a single-breasted black silk-velvet coat, worn open but with six buttons, a stand collar, gauntlet cuffs, four buttons at back, two at centre waist, two at bottom of tails. It was lined with black silk, except for the tail, which was white. Buttons were cut steel. The waistcoat was white satin or black silk, breeches were black velvet, with three steel buttons and steel buckles at the knee. Black silk stockings, black patent leather shoes with steel buckles, black silk or beaver hat, steel hilt sword and black scabbard, belt under waistcoat, white gloves, and white bow tie completed the dress. At levées velvet trousers with patent leather military boots were worn.

The regulations for 1912 were substantially the same as in 1908. The only difference for the new style was that the pocket flaps were to have the three points on the waist seams, the coat lined with white silk, tails with black lining, trousers were now not allowed at levées. The hat has a steel loop as a black silk cockade or rosette, sword belt a black silk waist belt under the waistcoat, with blue velvet frog. At levées one could wear with the velvet or cloth dress a black or very dark Inverness cape, or a long full dark overcoat.

In 1937, the final edition of ''Dress Worn at Court'' was published. The new style velvet court dress included a white satin waistcoat (not white corded silk or marcella), or a new optional black velvet waistcoat. The cocked hat is described as "beaver", silk being omitted. The shirt was to be as worn with evening dress, soft front with stiff white cuffs. Trousers were still prohibited.

====Cloth court dress====
In 1908, a dark cloth suit was worn for courts and evening parties. This was mulberry, claret, or green, but not black or blue. It was single-breasted, worn open but with six gilt buttons and dummy button-holes. There was a stand collar, gauntlet cuffs, two buttons at back centre waist, and two at bottom of tails. Gold embroidery was on the collar, cuffs, and pocket flaps as for the 5th class. There were matching breeches, gilt buckled, a white corded silk or marcella  waistcoat with four small gilt buttons. Stockings, tie, gloves, shoes, and hat were as for the new style, but gilt buckles were added to the shoes, and a gold loop on the hat. The sword was "Court Dress with gilt hilt", in a black scabbard gilt mounted, with gold knot. At levées, trousers were worn instead of breeches, to match the coat, and patent leather military boots.

In 1912 the cloth court dress is still described as embroidered on the collar, cuffs and pocket flaps as for 5th class. Buttons are gilt, convex, mounted with the imperial crown. Matching cloth trousers with rows {{convert|5/8|in|cm|adj=on}}-wide gold lace. By 1937 the cloth coat was decorated with gold embroidery similar to the edge of a Privy Counsellor's uniform coat ({{convert|5|in|cm}}?).&lt;ref name="dwc" /&gt;

====Alternative court dress====
[[File:ImperialConference.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Alternative court dress worn at the [[Imperial Conference]].]]
In 1924 white-tie evening dress was given official status as an 'Alternative Court Dress' for use on State occasions.&lt;ref&gt;''Dress worn at Court'' 1924 edition;&lt;/ref&gt; (from 1914 to the 1920s, an unofficial style had been used). It comprised black dress coat with silk [[facing (sewing)|facings]] (or [[revers]]), white marcella (or the same material as coat) waistcoat, black cloth knee-breeches with three buttons and black strap fastening with black buckle, black silk stockings with plain black court shoes with bows, and white gloves. This was worn with ordinary dress shirt, collar, white bow tie, and opera hat.

This was very similar to the "frock dress" introduced in the mid nineteenth century, and worn at dinners and evening parties when uniform was not worn: frock dress in 1883 comprised dress coat and waistcoat, breeches or pantaloons, white cravat. In 1908 this was described as being dress coat with silk facings, black or white waistcoat, black cloth or stockinette  breeches, with three black buttons and buckle at knee, pantaloons not now being allowed. This was worn with plain court shoes with bows, not buckles, and the cravat was replaced by a white tie. A folding cocked hat in corded silk with a black loop and rosette and white gloves finished the dress, which was used for dinners, balls, and receptions. In 1912, the frock dress was the same, except that the hat was now an opera hat. In 1929 and 1937, this was substantially the same, except that a stiff evening dress shirt and a winged collar were added, and opera hat omitted.

In the Army and Navy Stores catalogue of 1939 this dress is described as the "new pattern cloth (alternative) Evening Dress".

Official sanction of 'Frock dress' as an alternative to Court dress coincided with the election of Britain's first [[Labour Government 1924|Labour government]] (George V is said to have shown sensitivity to his new government in sartorial matters).&lt;ref name="mansfield" /&gt; Similarly, for the [[Coronation of George VI of the United Kingdom|1937 Coronation]], gentlemen were firmly instructed to wear 'full-dress uniform or full velvet Court dress'; but a note in the [[Gazette]] reveals that 'Members of the House of Commons may obtain particulars of alternative dress from the Speaker’s Secretary' and likewise 'representatives of trade unions and friendly societies may apply for information as to their dress to the Earl Marshal’s office'.&lt;ref&gt;Reported in the Glasgow Herald, 3 February 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|1953 Coronation]], those in procession in the [[Westminster Abbey|Abbey]] were instructed to wear full-dress uniform or Court dress; but for other gentlemen a range of dress was permitted: 'one of the forms of Court Dress as laid down in the Lord Chamberlain's Regulations for Dress at Court, or evening dress with knee breeches or trousers, or [[morning dress]], or dark lounge suits.'&lt;ref&gt;London Gazette, 2 December 1952&lt;/ref&gt; On both occasions, 'Oriental dress' was also permitted, for those for whom it was 'the usual Ceremonial Costume'.

In the twenty-first century old and new style velvet Court Dress has become the distinctive garb of High Sheriffs (see the external images in the links on the right). Male members of the Royal Family continue to wear 'Alternative Court Dress' (with knee-breeches) for the annual Diplomatic Reception at Buckingham Palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pomp and ceremony: We reveal the history and grandeur of the tiaras, garters, gowns and medals the Royal Family wore to dazzle ambassadors at a usually secret Buckingham Palace reception|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4015642/Regal-bling-reveal-tiaras-medals-finery-royal-family-turn-s-time-REALLY-dressed-Diplomatic-Reception.html|publisher=The Daily Mail|date=9 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varieties of court dress continue to be worn by senior legal professionals, and by certain parliamentary and other officials.

===Legal and other variations===

====Legal court dress====
[[File:Christopher Pitchford.JPG|thumbnail|upright|Legal court dress worn under ceremonial robe by a Lord Justice of Appeal]]
There were slight variations in the velvet and cloth court suits in the case of the judiciary and the legal profession in 1937.

This is worn still by legal persons, mostly by Queen's Counsel and judges of the superior courts – when sitting in the divisional court and administrative court of the [[Queen's Bench]] division of the [[High Court]], and in the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal Criminal Division]] – and by some parliamentary officials. It is a single-breasted cloth or velvet coat, of cut-back front style, with seven buttons although actually fastened edge-to-edge on the chest by a hook and eye arrangement. There are six buttons at the back, with two extra halfway down the tails. The coat is worn with a waistcoat, breeches to match the coat, black silk stockings, buckled shoes, sling sword, cocked hat, lace frill, ruffles, black silk flash (or wig-bag). They are worn with military boots and trousers for levées.  For daily wear, only the coat and waistcoat are worn, with trousers and shoes.

Full dress for the Lord Chancellor and judges comprises black cloth or velvet court coat, waistcoat, black cloth knee breeches, black silk stockings, shoes and steel buckles, plain bands, white gloves, and a beaver hat. The cloth dress is worn only on such occasions as when attending St Paul's Cathedral in state, the [[legal year|Lord Chancellor's Breakfast]], in court on the first day of [[Michaelmas term|Michaelmas Law Term]], and at the House of Lords when Her Majesty The Queen is personally present, and is worn with robes, wigs and lace bands. On other state and semi-state occasions, ordinary black velvet court dress of the legal style should be worn.

====Parliamentary use====
The Clerks of both Houses wear short wig and gown over a legal cloth court suit, worn with trousers and white bow tie. At the State Opening and on similar occasions the [[Clerk of the Parliaments]] and the [[Clerk of the House of Commons]] wear the same dress but with knee-breeches and lace jabot &amp; cuffs. The [[Clerk of the Crown in Chancery|Clerk of the Crown]] and his Deputy wear the same dress in most respects, but with bands rather than bow tie.

The [[Serjeants at Arms]] wear a cloth court suit of legal pattern with knee-breeches, white gloves and silver-hilted sword. On State occasions they wear lace and a collar of SS also. [[Black Rod]] is similarly dressed (with, on State occasions, his chain of office rather than the collar) but with black-hilted sword, black leather gloves and black shoe-buckles (rather than silver).

Attendants or messengers in both Houses have, since the nineteenth century, worn a black evening dress suit, black waistcoat, white tie and a silver badge suspended from the neck.

In the House of Commons, the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]] has traditionally worn a black silk gown over a black cloth court suit of legal pattern, knee-breeches, white bands, full-bottomed wig, and carries a three-cornered hat. On state occasions, as when attending on [[Majesty|Her Majesty]] together with the House of Commons, such as for the [[State Opening of Parliament]], or the presentation of an Address, the Speaker has traditionally worn a state robe of black satin damask with gold lace guarding, over a black velvet court suit, lace edged cravat (jabot), lace ruffles or cuffs, full-bottomed wig and white gloves (with hat, as above). The current Speaker has for the most part eschewed this traditional dress.

For mourning, the Speaker has traditionally worn a black parramatta gown, white 'weepers' (broad linen wraps) on coat cuffs, broad-hemmed frill and ruffles instead of lace, lawn bands, and black buckles on shoes and knees replacing the bright metal ones.&lt;ref&gt;as worn by Mr Speaker Martin at the Lying-in-State of HM The Queen Mother&lt;/ref&gt; Others in Court dress wear broad-hemmed frill and ruffles, black buckles and gloves and a black-mounted sword.

The Speaker's Secretary and his train-bearer wear a black cloth court suit of legal pattern, with lace frill and ruffles, steel buckles on breeches and shoes, cocked hat and sword.

The formal dress of the Lord Chancellor was and is almost identical to that traditionally worn by the Speaker of the House of Commons, as is that of the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords.

====Clerical court dress====
At courts and levées, bishops were directed to wear [[chimere|rochet and chimere]]; other clergy (and [[nonconformist]] ministers) were to wear [[cassock]], [[Geneva gown|gown]] and [[preaching scarf|scarf]]. For 'state or full dress dinners, and evening state parties', however, they were to wear a cloth court coat with knee-breeches and buckled shoes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/dressinsigniawor00greauoft#page/62/mode/2up ''Dress worn at court'', p62.]&lt;/ref&gt; For bishops the coat was purple (and was worn with a half-cassock called an 'apron'). For other clergy, the court coat was black; (deans and archdeacons wore aprons, junior clergy wore a clerical waistcoat). Archbishops of Canterbury continued to wear this form of dress, at state banquets, into the twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP_6SfmWzAk See video]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scottish dress====
[[File:Eben William Robertson.jpg|thumbnail|right|Scottish dress]]
In 1898, a special dress with sword and dirk was allowed for Chiefs and petty Chiefs as a military uniform at court. By 1908, this was extended to Highland gentlemen, and comprised: [[kilt]], [[sporran]], doublet of cloth or velvet, Highland belts, [[claymore]], [[dirk]], long [[Full plaid|plaid]].

By 1912, the qualification was absent and the description was more detailed. It was to comprise:
* black silk velvet full dress doublet
* set of silver Celtic or crested buttons
* superfine tartan full dress kilt
* short [[trews]] (if desired)
* full dress tartan hose
* full dress-length shoulder plaid
* full dress white hair sporran, silver-mounted and tassels
* dirk with knife and fork
* [[sgian dubh]] (sock knife)
* patent leather shoulder belt, silver-mounted
* waist belt with silver clasp
* silver mounted shoulder brooch
* silver kilt pin
* lace [[jabot (neckwear)|jabot]]
* one pair buckles for instep of shoes
* one pair small ankle buckles for shoes
* full dress brogues
* Highland claymore.
* [[Glengarry]] or [[Balmoral bonnet|Balmoral]], crest or ornament
* Cross belt of leather (or metal mounted) for carrying the sword worn over the right shoulder.

By 1937, the shoulder plaid became shoulder plaid or belted plaid. Dress sporran could be hair, fur, or skin, any pattern. Footwear was dress shoes and brogues. Highland Bonnet, feather or feathers if entitled. Highland pistols and powder horn may be worn.

Dress Doublet- of velvet, cloth or tartan. Waistcoat [if doublet is intended to be worn unbuttoned]- velvet, cloth, tartan; dress kilt; dress hose; plaid either shoulder or belted; shoulder brooch for plaid; dress sporran and strap or chain (sealskin, silver furnished top)- can be hair, fur, skin; Highland basket-hilt sword, black leather or metal mounted scabbard; sgian dubh (sock knife); dirk; kilt pin; jabot, lace (lace, silk, satin or lawn stock); cuffs, lace; Ghillie Brogue shoes (leather uppers, soles and tassels) or Dress shoes (with buckle); Highland Bonnet; belt and buckle (leather and lined); flashes; Highland pistols and powder horn may be worn; gloves are not worn.&lt;ref name="dwc" /&gt;

==Women's court dress==
{{See also|History of Western fashion}}

[[File:StateLibQld 1 109648 Agnes Melanie Dickson as a debutante, ca. 1890.jpg|thumb|left|Court dress, c.1890. Dress with long train attached, worn with feathers and veil]]
For women (as for men) court dress originally meant the best and most opulent style of clothing, as worn in fashionable and royal society. A distinctive style can be seen in the dresses and accoutrements worn by courtly ladies in the [[Elizabethan]] period, and likewise in subsequent reigns. The [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] put a stop to Court activity – and to opulent display in general; but with the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]], the opportunities afforded by attendance at the royal court was taken up all the more zealously by young women of status or aspiration (and their families).

[[File:1760s Court Dress.JPG|thumb|Court dress with exaggerated side-hoops, dating from the 1760s]]
Fashion (and wealth) continued to dictate what was worn on these occasions; but in the late eighteenth century, a degree of fossilisation began to set in, with the result that women in attendance at royal courts were still, in the early nineteenth century, to be seen in garments with side-hoops, redolent of forms of dress fashionable in the mid-1700s. In the 1820s, however, [[George IV]] made known his opinion that obsolete side-hooped dresses should no longer be worn; and thereafter [[History of Western fashion|fashion]] began to have more of an impact on the style of dress worn by women at court.

[[File:Viscountess Hayashi, later Countess Hayashi.jpg|thumb|left|Viscountess [[Hayashi Tadasu|Hayashi]], wife of Japan's resident minister to the UK, in 1902.]]
Courtly garments, then, can be seen reflecting something of the contemporary fashions of high society, from the expansive skirts and [[crinoline]]s of the [[1860s in fashion|1850-60s]], through the posterior [[bustle]]s of the [[1880s in fashion|1870s &amp; 80s]], right through to the straight gowns of the [[1920s in fashion|1920s]].

[[File:Fashion Plate (Court Dress) LACMA M.86.266.329.jpg|thumbnail|Illustration dating from the 1820s: low-cut fashionable dress worn with a train and long white gloves; headwear includes lappets, tiara and a profusion of feathers.]]
Some details of Court dress, though, were more or less invariable (and these set Court dress apart from more ordinary forms of evening or day wear in any given period). Moreover, from the late eighteenth century, what was worn at Court had been subject to a degree of regulation, and this helped standardise certain features. Most noticeably, court dresses (regardless of style) are expected to have a sizeable train attached (usually separate from the dress itself). Trains were required to be a minimum of three yards in length;&lt;ref name="dwc" /&gt; in the late 1800s a length of fifteen yards was not unusual.  The dress itself was expected to be long and low-cut (again, whatever the style). The prescribed headwear was also distinctive: ostrich feathers (usually three in number) were to be worn (to be 'mounted as a Prince of Wales plume', according to the instructions given in ''Dress worn at Court'') - a style which had its origin in fashionable eighteenth-century daywear. In addition, a short veil was worn, and/or lace [[lappets]] (first seen in the 1660s, and still being worn by some ladies in the 1930s).

By the end of the nineteenth century, the main occasions at which Court dresses were worn were those at which debutantes were presented to the Queen. In the twentieth century (especially following the First World War), occasions for full Court dress diminished. It was still required wear for ladies attending the 1937 Coronation (albeit without trains and veils - and Peeresses were expected to wear tiaras rather than feathers);&lt;ref&gt;London Gazette, 29 December 1936 ff&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1953, ladies attending the Coronation were directed to wear 'evening dresses or afternoon dresses, with a light veiling falling from the back of the head. Tiaras may be worn ... no hats'.&lt;ref&gt;London Gazette, 29 December 1952&lt;/ref&gt; Court presentations continued, except during wartime, but they gradually became less opulent. In the post-war 1940s evening Courts were replaced with afternoon presentations (for which afternoon dresses were worn); and with that, the donning of full Court dress ceased to be a rite of passage for young women taking their place in society.&lt;ref name="mansfield" /&gt;

==Court uniform==
[[File:Portrait of Sir Walter Townley (1863-1945).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Full-dress, 1st class, civil uniform worn by Sir Walter Townley]]
Court uniform came into being in the early nineteenth century. Two orders of dress are prescribed: full dress and levée dress. The full-dress uniform consists of a dark blue high-collar jacket with gold oak-leaf embroidery on the chest, cuffs and long tails; white breeches and stockings; and a [[cocked hat]] edged with [[ostrich]] feathers. [[Levee_(ceremony)|Levée]] dress is less ornate: the jacket is comparatively plain (with embroidery on the cuffs, collar and pockets only), and is worn with dark blue gold-striped trousers instead of breeches. On occasions, trousers are worn with the full-dress jacket; this is sometimes referred to as 'half-dress'.&lt;ref&gt;NB this term is ambiguous, as it is also used as a synonym for levée dress in some contexts.&lt;/ref&gt; Different grades (or 'classes') of uniform were stipulated for different grades of official; these are described in detail below.

[[File:Earl of Hopetoun Vanity Fair 17 May 1900.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Cartoon by '[[Leslie Ward|Spy]]' of the [[John Hope, 1st Marquess of Linlithgow|Lord Chamberlain]], showing the distinctive scarlet facings of the Household uniform.]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], court uniform was formerly worn by various ranks within the [[British civil service|Civil]] and [[ambassador|Diplomatic]] Service, by [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellors]], and by officials of the [[Royal Household]] (who were distinguished from other wearers of the uniform by having scarlet, rather than blue, collar and cuffs). Full dress was worn at courts, evening state parties, drawing rooms, state balls, state concerts, etc.; levée dress was worn at [[Levee (event)|levées]], and other ceremonies where full dress was not worn. Neither were worn after retirement without special permission.&lt;ref name="mansfield" /&gt;

===Origin, development and detail of the design===

====19th century====
In 1820, King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] introduced a court uniform based on the [[Windsor uniform]], modified by the dress of the [[Marshal of France]]. It had a dark blue single-breasted tail coat (or "[[coatee]]"), lined with black silk, the stand collar and gauntlet cuffs having scarlet velvet facings, gilt buttons, waistcoat, breeches or trousers. Soon only the Royal Household wore scarlet cloth facings, and all others had black velvet collar and cuffs. Later the facings, collar and cuffs became blue velvet.

These court uniforms came in five classes (later six), in both full dress (for the higher grades only) or levée dress. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class Household, as well as the 1st and 2nd class Civil Service, had full dress as well as levée dress, whereas the 4th and 5th class Household and the 3rd, 4th and 5th classes Civil Service had only levée dress for all occasions.

The class and category of the dress was indicated by the width of gold oak-leaf embroidery on the coatee: 1st class had {{convert|5|in|cm}}, 2nd class had {{convert|4|in|cm}}, 3rd class had {{convert|3|in|cm}}, 4th class {{convert|2|in|cm}}, and 5th class {{convert|3/8|in|cm}} each for full and levée dress gold lace. On both levée and full dress coatees the embroidery had a wavy edging for 1st class, and saw edge for lower classes.

 }}
In ''full dress'' the coatee's chest, back, tails back and front, collar, cuffs and pocket flaps were all decorated with gold oak-leaf embroidery. It was fastened by hooks and eyes, with dummy buttons bearing the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] (nine buttons up the front, showing between the two embroidered edges two at the waist behind, two at the bottom of back skirts). The coatee had white silk linings, and was worn with white breeches, white gloves, and patent leather court shoes with gilt buckles. The sword had black scabbard, gilt mountings, and sword knot of gold lace strap with bullion tassel; it was worn on a sword belt of white web, with white cloth frog.

In ''levée dress'' the coatee had the same embroidery, but only on collar, cuffs, and pocket flaps; the collar of the 1st and 2nd classes had embroidery all around the neck as on full dress, whereas that of 3rd class had front embroidery {{convert|4+1/2|in|cm}} long, that of 4th class had front embroidery {{convert|3|in|cm}} long, and that of 5th class a saw edge only. The coatee was fastened with practical buttons bearing the Crown onto button-holes. Blue cloth trousers were worn in place of breeches, with a gold oak lace stripe, {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm}} wide for 1st and 2nd classes, {{convert|2|in|cm}} for 3rd and 4th classes, and {{convert|1|in|cm}} for 5th class. White gloves were again worn, while patent leather military boots replaced the buckled shoes, and the sword accessories were similar to that on full dress, but with blue cloth frog.

Both types of dress were worn with black beaver [[cocked hat]], with black silk [[cockade]]; for the 1st class it had white ostrich feather border, as well as treble gold bullion loop and tassels. The 2nd class was as above, but with double gold bullion loop and tassels. The 3rd, 4th, 5th class had black ostrich feather border, plaited gold bullion loops, and no tassels.

In addition, a scarlet lined blue cloth cloak, double breasted, black velvet collar and two rows of six buttons each, with a detachable cape, was described in 1898 for outdoor wear, with a soft cloth forage cap (military staff shape), with a blue peak and scarlet welts around the crown and gold braid on top for the Household, and gold braid without scarlet welt in the case of other officials. The cap for consular use had silver instead of gold braid. A greatcoat as an alternative to the cloak, now without cape, was available in 1912.

====20th century====
[[File:KingRoyalVisit1939.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Canadian Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] (wearing Privy Counsellor's uniform) alongside two officials wearing 3rd and 4th class uniform (Ottawa, 1939).]]
A sixth uniform, which was classified as the 1st class of civil uniform, was introduced after the First World War, that of Privy Counsellors. Thereafter, the embroidery measured {{convert|5|in|cm}} for the new 1st class, {{convert|4+1/2|in|cm}} for the old 1st class, and {{convert|4|in|cm}} for old 2nd class; whereas the {{convert|3|in|cm|adj=on}} lace for old 3rd class, {{convert|2|in|cm|adj=on}} for the old 4th class and {{convert|3/8|in|cm|adj=on}} for the old 5th class were replaced by a standard {{convert|1|in|cm|adj=on}} gold lace on the cuffs (so that the collar alone became the distinguishing feature between these three classes of uniform).  The gold oak lace stripe for Privy Counsellors trousers measured {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm}}, as did 1st and 2nd classes. The trouser stripes of the 3rd class remained {{convert|2|in|cm}}, but that of 4th and 5th was now {{convert|1+3/4|in|cm}}. From the early 20th century the Privy Counsellors, 1st and 2nd classes' levée coatee embroidery was extended to include the centre back waist as well as the collar, cuffs and pocket flaps.

For Privy Counsellors, on both levée and full dress coatees the embroidery had a purl edging; the cocked hat was similar to that of the 1st class, but with additional hangers on the gold tassels.&lt;ref name="dwc" /&gt;

In 1908, white gloves were still mentioned in the regulations, while in 1912 they were not, and the 1937 regulation said that they are not worn.

Cabinet ministers, being Privy Counsellors, are entitled to wear the 1st Class civil uniform and continue to be so entitled after they leave Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/dressinsigniawor00greauoft#page/n88/mode/2up/search/ministers&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward VII]] ordered Privy Counsellors to wear civil uniform at [[Privy Council]] meetings, but this requirement has lapsed. In lieu of Civil Uniform or Court Dress, alternative dress may be worn by gentlemen (except for Household, Diplomatics and Consular Services) on all occasions when uniform or court dress is prescribed.

====21st century====
By the end of the 20th century the use of this uniform had greatly diminished. Within [[Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service]] ambassadors retain a simplified version&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/ukinholysee/6139956112/in/photostream/ Photo: UK Ambassador to the Holy See.]&lt;/ref&gt; for wear on such occasions as the presentation of credentials and then only when accredited to certain countries. Until about 1965 Foreign Office Regulations and Consular Instructions had required even junior foreign service officers to acquire this formal dress following completion of their probation period. The Governors of the few remaining colonial territories were notified in 2004 that the expense of providing uniforms would no longer be a recognised charge against the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. In the UK, Court uniform is still worn by a few select officials on formal State occasions (such as at the State Opening of Parliament); but the last time it was worn by people in significant numbers was at the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]].

Breeches, stockings and court shoes are now confined to coronations so trousers of the levee version are worn instead with full dress.

===Great Officers of State===

The [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] wears a unique form of Court uniform, his coatee being scarlet (with scarlet facings) rather than blue. The [[Earl Marshal]]'s coatee is also scarlet, with dark blue collar and cuffs. The Earl Marshall's officers (i.e. the [[Pursuivants]], [[Heralds]] and [[Kings of Arms]]) wear similar coatees with varying degrees of embroidery. All the aforementioned continue to wear the uniform at the State Opening of Parliament and on other occasions, the [[officers of arms]] wearing it under their tabards.

===Foreign Service variants===

Members of the ''Diplomatic Service'' wore Court Uniform: [[ambassadors]]' coats wore 1st class civil uniform, but with additional embroidery on the sleeves and back seams. [[High commissioner]]s for [[British Dominions|Dominions]] in London wore 1st class uniform. The High Commissioner for [[Southern Rhodesia]], and Agents-General for [[Australia]]n states wore 2nd class uniform. The King's or Queen's Foreign Service Messengers were entitled to 5th class court uniform (upgraded to 4th class in 1929) and also wore a distinctive greyhound badge.&lt;ref name="dwc" /&gt;

Members of the ''Consular Service'' wore a slightly different form of the uniform, with silver embroidery rather than gold predominating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Illustration (Governor John Beecroft (1790–1854), Spanish Governor of the Island of Fernando Po and Her Majesty's Consul for the Bight of Biafra) |url=https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/governor-john-beecroft-17901854-spanish-governor-of-the-island-of-fernando-po-and-her-majestys-consul-for-the-bight-of-biafra-10215 |website=ArtUK |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coatee (for both full-dress and levée dress) was in blue cloth, with a Prussian collar, single-breasted buttoning with nine frosted gilt buttons of royal arms, two more buttons on back waist, two more on coat tails. Consuls-general and consuls had embroidered gold and silver lace on collar, cuffs, pocket flaps, and back. [[Consul (representative)|Consuls-general]] had {{convert|2+1/2|in|cm}}, consuls {{convert|2|in|cm}}. Vice-consuls {{convert|1+1/2|in|cm}} on cuffs, and front half of collar only. All wore white breeches and stockings, patent leather court shoes with gilt buckles for full dress, or trousers with ''silver'' lace stripes and patent leather military boots for levée dress. Consuls' stripes were {{convert|2+1/4|in|cm}}, others' were {{convert|1+3/4|in|cm}}. These were worn with black beaver cocked hats, black cockade, ''silver'' bullion loops, and gold tassels. For consuls-general there were treble loops and a border of black ostrich feathers, for consuls double loops, and for vice-consuls single loops. A blue greatcoat or cloak, blue detachable cape was for outdoors use. The sword accessories were the same as for standard court uniform.&lt;ref name="dwc" /&gt;

Members of the ''Colonial Service'' wore Court Uniform (or military uniform, if so entitled); but [[Governor]]s, and [[Governors General]] have distinctive uniform of their own: a plain blue coat, scarlet collar and cuffs (embroidered in silver), silver epaulettes and trimmings and a plumed hat (with Governors General wearing [[aiguillettes]] in addition). This uniform (in slightly simplified form) continues to be worn by Governors of [[British Overseas Territories]]. Lieutenant-Governors and other officials of various ranks wear regular Court Uniform, as detailed above.&lt;ref name="dwc" /&gt;

Indian members of the [[Indian Civil Service]] were entitled to civil uniform, with a turban or pagre  replacing the cocked hat, or the national dress which they were accustomed to wear on ceremonial occasions. They could also wear a blue coat buttoning from the neck to below the waist, worn with white trousers or pyjamas and the native head-dress.

====Tropical dress====
For all the above, a simplified white uniform was provided for use in tropical postings: of white [[Drill (fabric)|drill]] with [[Gilding|gilt]] buttons. Members of the diplomatic and consular services had the same embroidery on the collar and cuffs as on the full-dress blue coatee, but worked on (detachable) white cloth panels. Members of the colonial service, on the other hand, wore dark blue [[gorget patches]] with gold braid, which varied according to rank (as did the number of buttons on the cuff).&lt;ref name="dwc" /&gt;

With this uniform the same cocked hat was worn as with the temperate uniform, or else (specifically 'out of doors during the day') a white [[sun helmet]] would be worn; in full-dress, the helmet would have a spike attached (for members of the diplomatic and consular services) or (for governors and governors general) a plume.

The term '''culture war''' or '''culture conflict''' has different meanings depending on the time and place where it is used, as it relates to conflicts relevant to a specific area and era.
Originally, it refers to the conflict between [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]], [[Classical Liberalism|classical liberal]], or [[conservative]] values and [[social democratic]], [[Progressivism|progressive]] or [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] values in the [[Western world]], as well as other countries.  Culture wars have influenced the debate over history, science and other curricula in all societies around the world.

It has come to signify different matters in modern United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, and generally, all over the world.

==Origins==
[[File:Kladderadatsch 1875 - Zwischen Berlin und Rom.png|thumb|200px|Bismarck (left) and the Pope, from the German satirical magazine ''[[Kladderadatsch]]'', 1875]]
The phrase "culture war" represents a loan translation ([[calque]]) from the German ''[[Kulturkampf]]''. The German word ''Kulturkampf'' (culture struggle) refers to the clash between cultural and religious groups in the campaign from 1871 to 1878 under [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] of the [[German Empire]] against the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Kulturkampf |encyclopedia=[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]] |year=1910 |publisher=[[Robert Appleton Company]] |location=New York |volume=8 |accessdate=March 27, 2015 |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08703b.htm |last=Spahn |first=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{further information|Ethnocultural politics in the United States}}

The expression "culture war" entered the vocabulary of United States politics with the publication of ''[[Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America]]'' by [[James Davison Hunter]] in 1991. Hunter perceived a dramatic realignment and polarization that had transformed [[politics of the United States|United States politics]] and [[culture of the United States|culture]], including the issues of [[abortion]], [[Gun law in the United States|federal]] and [[Gun laws in the United States by state|state gun laws]], [[global warming]], [[immigration]], [[separation of church and state]], [[Privacy laws of the United States|privacy]], [[recreational drug use]], [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]], and [[censorship]].

In American usage the term "culture war" may imply a conflict between those values considered [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or [[Conservativism in the United States|conservative]] and those considered [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] or [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. It originated in the 1920s when urban and rural American values came into clear conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assumption.edu/users/McClymer/his394/ |title=Seminar on the Culture Wars of the 1920s |date=Fall 2001 |accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This followed several decades of immigration to the States by people who earlier European immigrants considered "alien". It was also a result of the cultural shifts and modernizing trends of the [[Roaring 20s]], culminating in the presidential campaign of [[Al Smith]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/03/reclaiming_faith_and_politics.html |title= Culture Wars: How 2004 |last=Dionne |first=E. J. |authorlink=E. J. Dionne}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1928. However, [[James Davison Hunter]]'s 1991 book ''Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America'' redefined the "culture war" in the United States of America.  Hunter traces the concept to the 1960s.&lt;ref name=CultStrat&gt;{{cite book |last=Holt |first=Douglas |last2= Cameron |first2=Douglas |year=2010 |title= Cultural Strategy |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 978-0-19-958740-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived focus of the American culture war and its definition have taken various forms since then.&lt;ref name="Andrew Hartman 2015"&gt;Andrew Hartman, ''A War for the Soul of America: A History of the Culture Wars'' (University of Chicago Press, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
[[James Davison Hunter]], a [[sociologist]] at the [[University of Virginia]], introduced the expression again in his 1991 publication, ''Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America''. Hunter described what he saw as a dramatic realignment and polarization that had transformed [[politics of the United States|American politics]] and [[American culture|culture]].

He argued that on an increasing number of "hot-button" defining issues—[[abortion]], [[gun politics]], [[separation of church and state]], [[privacy]], [[recreational drug use]], [[homosexuality]], [[censorship]]—there existed two definable polarities. Furthermore, not only were there a number of divisive issues, but society had divided along essentially the same lines on these issues, so as to constitute two warring groups, defined primarily not by nominal religion, ethnicity, social class, or even political affiliation, but rather by ideological [[world-view]]s.

Hunter characterized this polarity as stemming from opposite impulses, toward what he referred to as ''Progressivism'' and as ''Orthodoxy''. Others have adopted the dichotomy with varying labels. For example, [[Fox News]] commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] emphasizes differences between "Secular-Progressives" and "Traditionalists".

[[File:Patrickjbuchanan.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Patrick Buchanan in 2008]]

In 1990, commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] mounted a campaign for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination for President against incumbent [[George H. W. Bush]] in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]]. He received a prime-time speech-slot at the [[1992 Republican National Convention]], to give his speech on the culture war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=Not since Pat Buchanan's famous 'culture war' speech in 1992 has a major speaker at a national political convention spoken so hatefully, at such length, about the opposition. |title=Dogs of War |url=http://www.newdonkey.com/2004/09/dogs-of-war.html |deadurl=yes |publisher=New Donkey |date=September 2, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308043424/http://www.newdonkey.com/2004/09/dogs-of-war.html |archivedate=March 8, 2005 |accessdate=August 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued: "There is a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we will one day be as was the Cold War itself."&lt;ref name="1992-GOP"&gt;{{Cite speech |authorlink=Patrick Buchanan |first=Patrick |last=Buchanan |title=1992 Republican National Convention Speech |date=August 17, 1992 |url=http://buchanan.org/blog/1992-republican-national-convention-speech-148 |accessdate=November 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to criticizing environmentalists and feminism, he portrayed [[public morality]] as a [[defining issue]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The agenda [Bill] Clinton and [Hillary] Clinton would impose on America—abortion on demand, a [[Litmus test (politics)|litmus test]] for the Supreme Court, homosexual rights, discrimination against religious schools, women in combat units—that's change, all right. But it is not the kind of change America wants. It is not the kind of change America needs. And it is not the kind of change we can tolerate in a nation that we still call God's country.&lt;ref name="1992-GOP" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A month later, Buchanan characterized the conflict as about power over society's definition of right and wrong. He named abortion, sexual orientation and popular culture as major fronts—and mentioned other controversies, including clashes over the [[Confederate flag]], Christmas and taxpayer-funded art. He also said that the negative attention his "culture war" speech received was itself evidence of America's polarization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buchanan.org/blog/the-cultural-war-for-the-soul-of-america-149 |title=The Cultural War for the Soul of America |last=Buchanan |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick Buchanan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture war had significant impact on national politics in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Andrew Hartman 2015" /&gt; The rhetoric of the [[Christian Coalition of America]] may have weakened president George H. W. Bush's chances for reelection in 1992 and helped his successor, [[Bill Clinton]], win reelection in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Roger |title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices |year=2010 |publisher=M. E. Sharpe |location=Armonk, NY |isbn=978-0-7656-1761-3 |page=88 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vRY27FkGJAUC&amp;pg=PA88}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the rhetoric of conservative cultural warriors helped Republicans gain control of Congress in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chapman |first=Roger |title=Culture Wars: An Encyclopedia of Issues, Viewpoints, and Voices |year=2010 |publisher=M.

The culture wars influenced the debate over state-school history curricula in the United States in the 1990s. In particular, debates over the development of national educational standards in 1994 revolved around whether the study of American history should be a "celebratory" or "critical" undertaking and involved such prominent public figures as [[Lynne Cheney]], [[Rush Limbaugh]], and historian [[Gary Nash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{google book |title=Who Owns History: Rethinking the Past in a Changing World |last=Foner |first=Eric |id=H3I-Z8KW5REC |location=New York |publisher=Hill &amp; Wang |year=2002 |isbn=1-4299-2392-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{google book |title=History on Trial: Culture Wars and the Teaching of the Past |last1=Nash |first1=Gary B. |authorlink1=Gary B.

===2000s===
{{expand-section|date=September 2018}}
[[File:Bush War Budget 2003-crop.jpg|thumb|[[George W. Bush]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and [[Paul Wolfowitz]] were prominent neo-conservatives of the 2000s.]]
A worldview called [[neo-conservatism]] shifted the terms of the debate in the early 2000s.  Neo-conservatives differed from their opponents in that they interpreted problems facing the nation as moral issues rather than economic or political issues.  For example, the decline of the traditional family structure was seen as a spiritual crisis by neo-conservatives that required a spiritual response.  Critics accused neo-conservatives of [[Correlation does not imply causation|confusing cause and effect]].&lt;ref&gt; Zafirovski, Milan.

==Canada==
{{Hatnote|See: [[Battle of Alberta]] and [[Battle of Ontario]]}}
In [[Canada]], "culture war" refers to differing values between [[Western Canada|Western]] versus [[Eastern Canada]], [[List of the 100 largest population centres in Canada|urban]] versus [[rural Canada]], as well as [[Conservatism in Canada|conservatism]] versus [[Liberalism in Canada|liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Gerald|last=Caplan |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/second-reading/culture-clash-splits-canadians-over-basic-values/article4626123/ |location=Toronto|work=The Globe and Mail |title=Culture clash splits Canadians over basic values |date=October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A divide between [[Francophone|French]] and [[Anglophone|English]] is also a consistent part of Canadian society.

The phrase "culture war" (or "culture wars") in Canada describes the [[political polarization|polarization]] between the different values of Canadians.{{cn|date=April 2017}} This can be [[Western Canada|West]] versus [[Eastern Canada|East]], [[Rural Canada|rural]] versus [[List of the 100 largest urban areas in Canada by population|urban]], or [[Conservatism in Canada|traditional values]] versus [[Progressivism in Canada|progressive values]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/second-reading/culture-clash-splits-canadians-over-basic-values/article4626123/ |location= Toronto |work= The Globe and Mail |title= Culture clash splits Canadians over basic values |date= October 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification | reason = No example of "culture war(s)" in a Canadian context|date=April 2017}} "Culture war" is a relatively new phrase in Canadian political commentary.

Interpretations of Aboriginal history became part of the wider political debate sometimes called the "[[History wars#History wars and culture wars|culture wars]]" during the tenure of the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] government from 1996–2007, with the [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[John Howard]] publicly championing the views of some of those associated with ''Quadrant''.&lt;ref name="Manne11/08"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2008/november/1277253191/robert-manne/what-rudd-s-agenda |last=Manne |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Manne |title=What is Rudd’s Agenda? |work=[[The Monthly]] |date=November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate extended into [[#National Museum of Australia controversy|a controversy]] over the way history was presented in the [[National Museum of Australia]] and in high school history curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rundle |first=Guy |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2007/06/28/1915-and-all-that-history-in-a-holding-pattern/ |title=1915 and all that: History in a holding pattern |work=Crikey |date=June 28, 2007 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ferrari |first=Justine&lt;!--Education writer--&gt; |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24492542-13881,00.html |title=History curriculum author defies his critics to find bias |work=The Australian |date=October 14, 2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also migrated into the general Australian media, with regular opinion pieces being published in major broadsheets such as ''[[The Australian]]'', ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]''. [[Marcia Langton]] has referred to much of this wider debate as 'war porn'&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard J. War porn.

Essay: Trapped in the aboriginal reality show. ''Griffith Review 2007'', 19:Re-imagining Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Australian Prime Ministers, Paul Keating and John Howard, were major participants in the "wars". According to the analysis for the Australian Parliamentary Library of Mark McKenna,&lt;ref name=McKenna&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/RP9798/98RP05 |title=Different Perspectives on Black Armband History |author=Mark McKenna |series=Parliamentary Library: Research Paper 5 1997-98 |publisher=The Parliament of Australia |date=November 10, 1997 |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Keating]] (1991–1996) was believed by John Howard (1996–2007) to portray Australia pre-[[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam]] in an unduly negative light; while Keating sought to distance the modern [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] movement from its historical support for the monarchy and the [[White Australia policy]] by arguing that it was the conservative Australian parties who had been barriers to national progress and excessively loyal to the British Empire. He accused Britain of having abandoned Australia during World War II. Keating was a staunch advocate of a symbolic apology to indigenous people for the misdeeds of past governments, and outlined his view of the origins and potential solutions to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage in his [[Redfern Park Speech]] (drafted with the assistance of historian [[Don Watson]]). In 1999, following the release of the 1998 ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' Report, Howard passed a Parliamentary [[Motion of Reconciliation]] describing treatment of Aborigines as the "most blemished chapter" in Australian history, but he did not make a Parliamentary apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |title=The History of Apologies Down Under &amp;#124; Thinking Faith |publisher=thinkingfaith.org |date=February 21, 2008 |accessdate=March 5, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202000730/http://www.thinkingfaith.org/articles/20080221_1.htm |archivedate=December 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard argued that an apology was inappropriate as it would imply "intergeneration guilt" and said that "practical" measures were a better response to contemporary Aboriginal disadvantage. Keating has argued for the eradication of remaining symbols linked to British origins: including deference for [[ANZAC Day]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smh.com.au/national/a-nation-reborn-at-anzac-cove-utter-nonsense-keating-20081030-5enw.html&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Australian flag]] and the [[monarchy in Australia]], while Howard was a supporter of these institutions. Unlike fellow Labor leaders and contemporaries, [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Kim Beazley]], Keating never traveled to [[Gallipoli]] for ANZAC Day ceremonies. In 2008 he described those who gathered there as "misguided".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/a-nation-reborn-at-anzac-cove-utter-nonsense-keating-20081030-5enw.html |title=A nation reborn at Anzac Cove?

In 2006, John Howard said in a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of ''Quadrant'' that "Political Correctness" was dead in Australia but: "we should not underestimate the degree to which the soft-left still holds sway, even dominance, especially in Australia's universities"; and in 2006, ''Sydney Morning Herald'' political editor [[Peter Hartcher]] reported that Opposition foreign affairs spokesman [[Kevin Rudd]] was entering the philosophical debate by arguing in response that "John Howard, is guilty of perpetrating 'a fraud' in his so-called culture wars... designed not to make real change but to mask the damage inflicted by the Government's economic policies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/pms-culture-wars-a-fraud-rudd/2006/10/27/1161749320974.html |title=PM's culture wars a fraud: Rudd - National |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=October 28, 2006 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat of the Howard government in the Australian Federal election of 2007, and its replacement by the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Labor government]], altered the dynamic of the debate. Rudd made an official apology to the ''[[Stolen Generation]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/02/12/australia.text/index.html |title=Full text of Australia's apology to Aborigines |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=February 12, 2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with bi-partisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/brendan-nelsons-sorry-speech/2008/02/13/1202760366050.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |title=Brendan Nelson's sorry speech |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=February 13, 2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Keating, Rudd supported an Australian republic, but in contrast to Keating, Rudd declared support for the [[Australian flag]] and supported the commemoration of ANZAC Day and expressed admiration for Liberal Party founder [[Robert Menzies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/keating-utterly-wrong-on-gallipoli-pm/story-0-1111117908459 |title=Paul Keating 'utterly wrong' to reject Gallipoli identity, says Kevin Rudd |date=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/is-rudd-having-a-bob-each-way/2007/04/12/1175971263000.html |title=Is Rudd having a Bob each way? - Opinion |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=October 28, 2004 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the change of government, and the passage, with support from all parties, of a Parliamentary apology to indigenous Australians, Professor of Australian Studies Richard Nile has argued: "the culture and history wars are over and with them should also go the adversarial nature of intellectual debate",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/richardnile/index.php/theaustralian/comments/end_of_the_culture_wars |title=End of the culture wars &amp;#124; Richard Nile Blog, ''The Australian'' |publisher=blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au |date=November 28, 2007 |accessdate=April 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309215605/http://blogs.theaustralian.news.com.au/richardnile/index.php/theaustralian/comments/end_of_the_culture_wars/ |archivedate=March 9, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a view contested by others, including conservative commentator [[Janet Albrechtsen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/orwellian-left-quick-to-unveil-totalitarian-heart/story-e6frg6n6-1111115088194 |title=Orwellian Left quick to unveil totalitarian heart |work=The Australian |date=December 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An intention to reengage in the history wars has been indicated by the Federal Opposition's [[Christopher Pyne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?&amp;docID=SMH130427114V71OBPNC Julia Baird, (April 27, 2013), Don't dismiss nation's blemishes ''Sydney Morning Herald'', Sydney, p. 12]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dany Bébel-Gisler''' (7 April 1935 – 28 September 2003) was an Afro-Guadeloupean writer and [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguist]] who specialized in [[Antillean Creole]] and [[ethnology]]. She was one of the first linguists to defend the preservation and teaching of [[Creole language]]s and study how the interplay of the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Caribbean reflected the social hierarchy, as well as the assimilation or lack thereof of both the colonizers and colonized. She was instrumental in the development of [[UNESCO]]'s [[The Slave Route Project]], tracing the intersection of African, Caribbean and European cultures and published several novels and children's books on Guadeloupean culture.

==Early life==
Dany Bébel was born on 7 April 1935 in [[Pointe-à-Pitre]] on the island of [[Guadeloupe]] in the [[French Antilles]]. Her father's family owned a [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantation]] in Guadeloupe and her mother was a [[mulatto]] woman who was an agricultural worker on the plantation.{{sfn|Santiago|2016}} Growing up on her grandfather’s sugarcane plantation, she was encouraged to pursue her educational dreams in France.{{sfn|Mesh|1997|p=30}} During her teens, she moved to France and attended a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] in [[Toulouse]].{{sfn|Santiago|2016}} She then went on to study at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris. When she graduated, Bébel became the first person in her mother's family to have earned her [[baccalauréat]].{{sfn|Mesh|1997|p=30}} Receiving the Prix Spécial de Français, she went on to study at the [[Grandes écoles]], under the tutelage of [[Michel Leiris]], focusing on ethnology, linguistics and sociology.{{sfn|Santiago|2016}}{{sfn|Mesh|1997|p=30}}

==Career==
Bébel-Gisler began working in France in the 1960s,{{sfn|Santiago|2016}}{{sfn|Mesh|1997|p=30}} while she was completing her university studies. She taught in [[Nanterre]] and [[Aubervilliers]], focusing on educating immigrants and working-class students. She led an adult literacy program in Paris, which targeted African and Algerian immigrants.  In 1976, she returned to Guadeloupe with the goal of launching an experimental teaching project for rural residents living in the area around [[Lamentin]]. Her target group was illiterate adults who were not French-speaking, so that she could create a spelling system for the local [[Creole language]]. At the time, there were few Creole texts that did not look at the language from an [[Etymology|etymological]] analysis standpoint. Publishing a booklet, ''Kèk Prinsip Pou Ékri Kréyól'' (Some Principles for Writing in Kreol), in 1975, she proposed designing a notational system for [[Antillean Creole|Guadeloupean Creole]] based upon the [[Haitian Creole|Haitian]] model which had been developed, but which could be researched, refined, and applied to create a written standard for educational purposes.{{sfn|Schnepel|2004|p=89}} In 1976, she published ''La Langue créole, force jugulée'' (The Creole language, forced suppression), which evaluated the system in French schools which placed immigrant children in remedial classes because they could not speak standard French. Removing them from regular classes, she believed, caused students to feel inferior and impacted their further education and later their ability to get jobs.{{sfn|Mesh|1997|pp=30–31}} Thus, language, rather than being a commonality between peoples became a means of maintaining social boundaries.{{sfn|Santiago|2016}}

In 1979, Bébel-Gisler founded the alternative-educational Centre d'Education Populaire Bwadoubout, to provide literacy for disadvantaged adults or children who wanted access to learning, but may have been obstructed because formal schools taught only in French. She directed the center and received funding from the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|French National Center for Scientific Research]],{{sfn|Schnepel|2004|pp=89–90}} though in effect, her work at Bwadoubout undermined the governmental objectives of assimilation.{{sfn|Schnepel|2004|p=91}} Language became a vehicle for activism,{{sfn|Schnepel|2004|p=90}}{{sfn|Berrian|2000|p=40}} for Bébel-Gisler, who recognized that controlling access to knowledge insured that certain social classes or those with certain backgrounds controlled the power. By refusing to use French, Guadeloupeans were creating a distinction between themselves, their colonizer, and other Antillean colonies, as well as rejecting assimilation.{{sfn|Schnepel|2004|p=90}}

In addition to her educational efforts, Bébel-Gisler began publishing novels. In 1985, her biographical novel ''Lénora: l’histoire enfouie de la Guadeloupe'' (Leonora: the buried story of Guadeloupe) described the period between 1940 and 1943, when Governor {{ill|Constant Sorin|fr}} instituted policies to isolate Guadeloupe and [[Martinique]] from the potentiality of American or British occupation, leading to widespread suffering on the islands.{{sfn|Berrian|2000|p=111}} The book was released in English in 1994 and she published the children's book, ''Grand'mère, ça commence où la Route de l'esclave?'' (Grandmother, where does the Slave Route begin?) in 1998.{{sfn|''Île en île''|2015}} The book retraced the slave triangle and was a means of acknowledging the past and its impact on history.{{sfn|Santiago|2016}} In 2000, she published, ''À la recherche d’une odeur de grand’mère; D’en Guadeloupe une « enfant de la Dass » raconte…'' (In Search of Grandmother's Smell: Tales from a "child of the Dass" in Guadeloupe).{{sfn|''Île en île''|2015}} The book tells how the sugar plantation shaped both the landscape and the people who worked within it, replacing family ties with communal relationships and changing the nature of the relationships between men and women and parents and children. It explores the competing themes prevalent in Guadeloupean society where matrifocality and patriarchy  meet.{{sfn|Cases Rebelles|2017}}

In 1996, Bébel-Gisler became affiliated with [[UNESCO]]'s [[The Slave Route Project]], tracing the intersection of African, Caribbean and European cultures through the monuments of the [[slave trade]]. She was responsible for documenting the Caribbean portion of the route.{{sfn|MAXImini|2003}}{{sfn|''Île en île''|2015}} Bringing the project to Guadeloupe, she identified eighteen significant extant sites including plantations, forts, and jails.{{sfn|Young|2016}} 

==Death and legacy==
Bébel-Gisler died unexpectedly of a heart attack on 28 September 2003 at her home in Lamentin.{{sfn|MAXImini|2003}}{{sfn|''Île en île''|2015}} She is widely remembered for her activism in preserving Guadeloupean Creole.{{sfn|Santiago|2016}}{{sfn|Mesh|1997|pp=31–32}}

'''David John Cawdell Irving''' (born 24 March 1938) is an English author &lt;!--NOTE: The consensus from talk page discussions has been that modern reliable sources generally do not state that David Irving is a "historian" and as a result the term "author" is used. Please do not change this without first obtaining consensus on the article's talk page --&gt; and [[Holocaust denier]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hare |first1=Ivan |last2=Weinstein |first2=James |lastauthoramp=yes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F6d08lrIYNQC&amp;pg=PA553 |page=553 |title=Extreme Speech and Democracy |location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |isbn=0199601798}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has written on the military and political history of [[World War II]], with a focus on [[Nazi Germany]]. His works include ''[[The Destruction of Dresden]]'' (1963), ''[[Hitler's War]]'' (1977), ''Churchill's War'' (1987) and ''Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich'' (1996). In his works, he argued that [[Adolf Hitler]] did not know of the extermination of Jews or, if he did, opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2001|p=101}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Irving's revisionist views of World War II were never taken seriously by mainstream historians, he was once recognised for his knowledge of Nazi Germany and his ability to unearth new historical documents.

Irving marginalised himself in 1988 when, based on his reading of the [[pseudoscientific]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;[[Leuchter Report]] dismissed as pseudoscientific
*"Leuchter and Rudolf have published pseudoscientific reports purporting to show that chemical residues present in the gas chambers of [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] are incompatible with homicidal gassings."

*"The Leuchter Report, a pseudo-scientific document which allegedly proves that Zyklon B was not used to exterminate human beings, was translated into Arabic and sold at the International Book Fair in Cairo in January 2001." Roth, Stephen. Stephen Roth Institute. ''Antisemitism Worldwide, 2000/1'', University of Nebraska Press, 2002, p. 228.
*"The turning point came in 1989, when Irving launched Fred Leuchter's pseudo-scientific Leuchter Report, which made the spurious claim that the absence of cyanide residues in the walls of the gas chambers at Auschwitz and other camps proved that they could not have functioned as mass extermination centres." Brinks, Jan Herman. Timms, Edward. Rock, Stella. ''Nationalist Myths and Modern Media'', [[I.B. Tauris]], 2006, p. 72.
*"The Leuchter report, was, indeed, an amateurish report produced by a man with no expertise, either historical or forensic." Hirsh, David. ''Law Against Genocide''. Routledge Cavendish, 2003, p. 134.
*"Another common tactic of the deniers is to engage in historical inquiries that on the surface appear legitimate but upon close examination prove to be based on pseudo-science. One prominent example was the investigation of the Auschwitz gas chambers by [[Fred Leuchter]] [...] Detailed study of the "Leuchter Report" revealed that it was based on erroneous assumptions (cyanide does not penetrate deeply into concrete). It also emerged that Leuchter had falsified his credentials and overstated his expertise. Despite this, his report is still cited by deniers." Cull, Nicholas John. Culbert, David Holbrook. Welch, David. ''Propaganda and Mass Persuasion: A Historical Encyclopedia, 1500 to the Present'', ABC-CLIO, 2003, p. 168.
*"... the institute relied primary on the talents of a California-based publicist named Bradley Smith who packaged and promoted Leuchter's discredited material as if it were the very essence of "scientific research" or at least a tenable "point of view," intrinsically worthy of inclusion in the academic agenda..." Churchill, Ward. ''A Little Matter of Genocide: Holocaust and Denial in the Americas, 1492 to the Present''. City Lights Books, 1997, p. 24.
*"After the trial, both Irving and Zündel published the results of Leuchter's trial research as ''The Leuchter Report: The End of a Myth,'' despite the fact that the court rejected both the report and Leuchter's testimony. [...] The discredited report is popular in the Holocaust denial movement and one edition features a foreword by Irving." Gerstenfeld, Phyllis B. Grant, Diana R. ''Crimes of Hate: Selected Readings'', SAGE Publications, 2003, p. 201.
*"Leuchter's report contained a considerable amount of scientific, or, as it turned out, pseudo-scientific analysis of chemical residues on the gas chamber walls and similar matters. It was quickly discredited, not least on the basis of Leuchter's failure adequately to defend his findings on the witness stand." Evans, Richard J.

Irving's reputation as a [[historian]] was discredited&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Irving discredited as a historian
*"In 1969, after David Irving's support for [[Rolf Hochhuth]], the German playwright who accused Winston Churchill of murdering the Polish wartime leader General Sikorski, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' issued a memo to all its correspondents. 'It is incorrect,' it said, 'to describe David Irving as a historian.

*"It may seem an absurd semantic dispute to deny the appellation of 'historian' to someone who has written two dozen books or more about historical subjects. But if we mean by historian someone who is concerned to discover the truth about the past, and to give as accurate a representation of it as possible, then Irving is not a historian. Those in the know, indeed, are accustomed to avoid the term altogether when referring to him and use some circumlocution such as 'historical writer' instead. Irving is essentially an ideologue who uses history for his own political purposes; he is not primarily concerned with discovering and interpreting what happened in the past, he is concerned merely to give a selective and tendentious account of it to further his own ideological ends in the present. The true historian's primary concern, however, is with the past. That is why, in the end, Irving is not a historian."

==Early life==
[[File:David Irving at Brentwood 1955.jpg|thumb|Irving in 1955]]
Irving and his twin brother Nicholas&lt;ref name="Guttenplan 41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; were born in [[Hutton, Essex|Hutton]], near [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]], [[Essex]], England. They had a brother, John,&lt;ref&gt;"Irving, John N B (mother Newington)" in Register of Births for Hampstead Registration District, vol. 1a (1930), p. 803&lt;/ref&gt; and sister, Jennifer.&lt;ref&gt;"Irving, Jennifer C (mother Newington)" in Register of Births for Billericay Registration District, vol. 4a	(1935), p. 878&lt;/ref&gt; Their father, John James Cawdell Irving (1898–1967), was a career naval officer and a commander in the [[Royal Navy]]. His mother, Beryl Irving (''née'' Newington), was an illustrator and writer of children's books. Nicholas Irving has said that "David used to run toward bombed out houses shouting 'Heil Hitler!'", a statement which Irving denies.&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;{{cite news|last=Craig|first=Olga|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1511495/David-what-on-earth-would-Mother-think.html |title='David, what on earth would Mother think?'|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=26 February 2006|accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Johann | last=Hari | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/david-irving-im-hitlers-biographer-1366464.html | title=David Irving: 'Hitler appointed me biographer' | publisher=The Independent | date=15 January 2009 | accessdate = 26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Irving's father was an officer aboard the light cruiser [[HMS Edinburgh (C16)|HMS ''Edinburgh'']]. On 30 April 1942, while escorting [[Convoy QP 11]] in the [[Barents Sea]], the ship was badly damaged by the German submarine [[German submarine U-456|U-456]]. Two days later she was attacked by surface craft, and now beyond recovery was abandoned and scuttled by a torpedo from [[HMS Foresight (H68)|HMS ''Foresight'']]. Irving's father survived, but severed all links with his wife and children after the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irving described his childhood in an interview with the American writer [[Ron Rosenbaum]] as: "Unlike the Americans, we English suffered great deprivations ... we went through childhood with no toys. We had no kind of childhood at all. We were living on an island that was crowded with other people's armies".&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum 227"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosenbaum|1999|p=227}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his brother, Nicholas, David has also been a provocateur and prankster since his youth.&lt;ref name="Craig"/&gt;

Irving went on to say to Rosenbaum that his [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|negationist]] views about World War II dated to his childhood, particularly due to his objections to the way [[Adolf Hitler]] was portrayed in the British media during the war.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum 227" /&gt; Irving asserted that his "sceptical" views about the Third Reich were rooted in his doubts about the cartoonist caricatures of Hitler and the other Nazi leaders published in the British wartime press.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum 227" /&gt;

==Student years==
After completing [[Advanced Level (UK)|A levels]] at [[Brentwood School (Brentwood, England)|Brentwood School]], Irving briefly studied physics at [[Imperial College London]]. He did not complete the course because of financial constraints.&lt;ref name="Guttenplan 41" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ShermerGrobman2009p281"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shermer|Grobman|2009|p=281}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irving later studied for two years toward a degree in [[political economy]] at [[University College London]],&lt;ref name=IrvingPQ17libel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpp.co.uk/Legal/PQ17Libel/Background220170.html |title=David Irving: Information for Counsel on my Background |publisher=Fpp.co.uk |accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he again had to drop out due to lack of funds.&lt;ref name="adl profile"&gt;Profile on the [[#CITEREFadl2005|ADL website]].&lt;/ref&gt; During this period at university, he participated in a debate on [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] immigration, seconding [[British Union of Fascists]] founder [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff|url=http://www.fpp.co.uk/online/08/03/images/Mosley_at_UCL.gif |title=Mosley packs them in |newspaper=[[Pi (magazine)|Pi]] |date=2 February 1961 |accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Carnival Times'' controversy===
Irving's time as editor of the ''Carnival Times'', a student [[rag mag]] of the [[University of London]] Carnival Committee, became controversial in 1959 when he added a "secret supplement" to the magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.adl.org/learn/ext_us/irving.html?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=irving Extremism in America: David Irving] [[Anti-Defamation League]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waterhouse/&gt; This supplement contained an article in which he called Hitler the "greatest unifying force Europe has known since [[Charlemagne]]". Although Irving deflected criticism by characterising the ''Carnival Times'' as "[[satire|satirical]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wyden|2001|p=159}},&lt;/ref&gt; he also stated that "[[Treaty of Rome|the formation of a European Union]] is interpreted as building a group of superior peoples, and the Jews have always viewed with suspicion the emergence of any 'master-race' (other than their own, of course)".&lt;ref name="50 Years On: David Irving, Apartheid and ULU"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lay |first=Kat |url=http://www.london-student.net/2009/05/26/50-years-on-david-irving-apartheid-and-ulu/ |title=50 years on: David Irving, Apartheid and ULU |publisher=London Student |date=26 May 2009 |accessdate=21 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130160544/http://www.london-student.net/2009/05/26/50-years-on-david-irving-apartheid-and-ulu/ |archivedate=30 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents also viewed a cartoon included in the supplement as racist and criticised another article in which Irving wrote that the British press was owned by Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Stephen E.|last=Atkins|year=2009|title=Holocaust Denial as an International Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M9Uj6u6b-ZIC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=david+irving+racist+cartoon+carnival+times&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CPPq8nAfud&amp;sig=S9fwopC3NA0OZopQGzikA70mUy4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4jLGVk_fYAhVT3GMKHTBhBqgQ6AEIVzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20irving%20racist%20cartoon%20carnival%20times&amp;f=false|location=Walport, Connecticut; London, England|publisher=Praeger|page=119|isbn=978-0-313-34538-8|author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers were later recruited to remove and destroy the supplements before the magazine's distribution.&lt;ref name="50 Years On: David Irving, Apartheid and ULU"/&gt; Irving has said that the criticism is "probably justifiable" and has described his motivation in producing the controversial secret issue of ''Carnival Times'' as being to prevent the ''Carnival'' from making a profit that would be passed on to a South African group which he considered a "subversive organisation".&lt;ref name=IrvingPQ17libel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drs.library.yale.edu:8083/saxon/SaxonServlet?style=http://drs.library.yale.edu:8083/saxon/EAD/yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&amp;source=http://drs.library.yale.edu:8083/fedora/get/mssa:ms.1500/EAD&amp;big=y&amp;adv=&amp;query=South%20African%20Apartheid%20Collection%20&amp;filter=&amp;hitPageStart=1&amp;sortFields=&amp;view=c01_8 |title=International Pressure Groups |publisher=Drs.library.yale.edu:8083 |accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Destruction of Dresden''==
After serving in 1959 as editor of the University of London Carnival Committee's journal, Irving left for West Germany, where he worked as a steelworker in a [[Thyssen AG]] steel works in the [[Ruhr]] area and learned the [[German language]]. He then moved to Spain, where he worked as a clerk at an air base. During his time in Spain, Irving met his first wife, a Spanish woman with whom he had four children.&lt;ref name="Craig"/&gt;

In 1962, he wrote a series of 37 articles on the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing campaign]], ''Und Deutschlands Städte starben nicht'' (''And Germany's Cities Did Not Die''), for the German [[boulevard journalism|boulevard journal]] ''Neue Illustrierte''. These were the basis for his first book, ''[[The Destruction of Dresden]]'' (1963), in which he examined the Allied [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]] in February 1945. By the 1960s, a debate about the morality of the [[carpet bombing]] of German cities and civilian population had already begun, especially in the United Kingdom. There was consequently considerable interest in Irving's book, which was illustrated with graphic pictures and it became an international [[best-seller]].

In the first edition, Irving's estimates for deaths in [[Dresden]] were between 100,000 and 250,000 – notably higher than most previously published figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|pp=225–226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These figures became authoritative and widely accepted in many standard reference works. In later editions of the book over the next three decades, he gradually adjusted the figure downwards to 50,000–100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard J. Evans]] at the 2000 libel trial that Irving brought against [[Deborah Lipstadt]], Irving based his estimates of the dead of Dresden on the word of one individual who provided no supporting documentation, used forged documents, and described one witness who was a [[urologist]] as Dresden's Deputy Chief Medical Officer. The doctor later complained about being misidentified by Irving, and further, was only reporting rumours about the death toll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=225}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of deaths in the bombing raids may never be known. The presence in the city of over 100,000 refugees fleeing the advance of the Red Army means there is no accurate record of them. Two tourist books, one written by Herbert Wotte and Siegfried Hoyer, published in 1978, give the casualties as 35,000; another compiled by Jurgen Rach and Erwin and Inge Hartsche (1977), agrees with this figure. The [[East Germany|DDR]] officially accepted figure was "a minimum of 35,000 dead". Alexander McKee looked at other firebombings of German cities, notably Hamburg, and concluded that "the figure of 35,000 for one night's massacre alone might easily be doubled to 70,000 without much fear of exaggeration, because of the exodus of refugees from Silesia."&lt;ref&gt;McKee, Alexander, ''Dresden 1945'', Granada Publishing Ltd., UK, 1983, pps:369–370. {{ISBN|0-583-13686-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to an investigation by Dresden City Council in 2008, casualties at Dresden were only estimated as 22,700–25,000 dead.&lt;ref&gt;Seeking to establish a definitive casualty figure, an independent investigation (commissioned by the Dresden city council), ended in 2010 drawing a conclusion that a maximum of 25,000 people were killed, of which 22,700 deaths have been positively identified—20,100 named and a further 2,600 unnamed ({{Citation|date=10 January 2008 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26977893/ns/world_news-europe/t/report-dresden-bombing-deaths-overestimated/#.T_wU_HqDmSo |title=Report: Dresden bombing deaths overestimated |publisher=MSNBC}};  {{de_icon}} {{Citation  |date=15 April 2010  |url=http://www.sz-online.de/Nachrichten/Freital/?etag=15.04.2010 |title=Mindestzahl der Dresdner Bombenopfer nach oben korrigiert (lowest number of Dresden raids casualties corrected upwards|newspaper=[[Sächsische Zeitung]]}} {{subscription}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Irving had based his numbers on what purported to be "TB 47", a document promulgated by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, and on claims made after the war by a former Dresden Nazi functionary, Hans Voigt, without verifying them against official sources available in Dresden. Irving's estimates and sources were first disputed by [[Walter Weidauer]], Mayor of Dresden 1946–1958, in his own account of the Dresden bombing. When it was later confirmed that the TB 47 used was a forgery, Irving published a letter to the editor in ''[[The Times]]'' on 7 July 1966 retracting his estimates, writing that he had "no interest in promoting or perpetuating false legends". In 1977 the real document TB 47 was located in Dresden by Götz Bergander.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|2001|pages=148–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Walter|last= Weidauer|title=Inferno Dresden.

Despite acknowledging that the copy of "TB 47" he had used was inaccurate, Irving argued during the late 1980s and 1990s that the death toll at Dresden was much higher than the accepted estimates: in several speeches during this period he said that 100,000 or more people had been killed in the bombing of Dresden. In some of the speeches Irving also argued or implied that the raid was comparable to the Nazis' killing of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2001|pp=179–191}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1963 burglary of Irving's flat===
In November 1963, Irving called the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] with suspicions he had been the victim of a burglary by three men who had gained access to his Hornsey flat in London claiming to be [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]] (GPO) engineers. [[Anti-fascism|Anti-fascist]] activist [[Gerry Gable]] was convicted in January 1964, along with Manny Carpel. They were fined £20 each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Copsey|first=Nigel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gxgxDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT194|title=Anti-Fascism in Britain|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success of the Dresden book, Irving continued writing, including some works of [[Historical revisionism (political)|revisionist history]], although his 1964 work ''[[The Mare's Nest]]'' – an account of the German [[V-weapons]] programme and the Allied intelligence countermeasures against it – was widely praised when published and continues to be well regarded. [[Michael J. Neufeld]] of the Smithsonian's [[National Air and Space Museum]] has described ''The Mare's Nest'' as "the most complete account on both Allied and German sides of the V-weapons campaign in the last two years of the war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neufeld|first=Michael J|chapter=Creating a Memory of the German Rocket Program for the Cold War|editor-last=Dick|editor-first=Steven J|title=Remembering the Space Age|publisher=Government Printing Office|year=2009|isbn=9780160867118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Irving translated the ''Memoirs'' of Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Keitel]] in 1965 (edited by Walter Görlitz) and in 1967 published ''Accident: The Death of General Sikorski''. In the latter book, Irving claimed that the plane crash which killed  [[Polish government in exile]] leader General [[Władysław Sikorski]] in 1943 was really an assassination ordered by [[Winston Churchill]], so as to enable Churchill to betray Poland to the [[Soviet Union]]. Irving's book inspired the highly controversial 1967 play  ''[[Soldiers (play)|Soldiers]]'' by his friend, the German playwright [[Rolf Hochhuth]], where Hochhuth depicts Churchill ordering the "assassination" of General Sikorski.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-13774, Adolf Hitler.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Irving once said he works to remove the "slime" applied to the reputation of [[Adolf Hitler]] ''(pictured)''.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum 232"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosenbaum|1999|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Also in 1967, Irving published two more works: ''The Virus House'', an account of the [[German nuclear energy project]] for which Irving conducted many interviews,&lt;ref name="Virus House research"/&gt; and ''The Destruction of Convoy PQ-17,'' in which he blamed the British escort group commander, Commander [[Jack Broome]] for the catastrophic losses of the [[Convoy PQ-17]]. Amid much publicity, Broome sued Irving for libel in October 1968, and in February 1970, after a 17 day-trial before London's [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], Broome won. Irving was forced to pay £40,000 in damages, and the book was withdrawn from circulation.

After ''PQ-17'', Irving largely shifted to writing biographies. In 1968, he published ''Breach of Security'', an account of German reading of messages to and from the British Embassy in Berlin before 1939 with an introduction by the British historian [[Donald Cameron Watt]]. As a result of Irving's success with ''Dresden'', members of Germany's extreme right wing assisted him in contacting surviving members of Hitler's inner circle. In an interview with the American journalist [[Ron Rosenbaum]], Irving claimed to have developed sympathies towards them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosenbaum|1999|pp=227–229}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many ageing former mid- and high-ranked Nazis saw a potential friend in Irving and donated diaries and other material. Irving described his historical work to Rosenbaum as an act of "stone-cleaning" of Hitler, in which he cleared off the "slime" that he felt had been unjustly applied to Hitler's reputation.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum 232" /&gt;

In 1969, during a visit to Germany, Irving met [[Robert Kempner]], one of the American prosecutors at [[Nuremberg trials|Nuremberg]].&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 293"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|2005|p=293}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Irving asked Kempner if the "official record of the Nuremberg Trials was falsified", and told him that he was planning to go to Washington, D.C. to compare the sound recordings of Luftwaffe Field-Marshal [[Erhard Milch]]'s March 1946 evidence with the subsequently published texts to find proof that evidence given at Nuremberg was "tampered with and manipulated".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|2005|pp=293–294}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return to the United States, Kempner wrote to [[J. Edgar Hoover]], the director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], that Irving expressed many "anti-American and anti-Jewish statements".&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 293" /&gt;

In 1971, Irving translated the memoirs of General [[Reinhard Gehlen]], and in 1973 published ''The Rise and Fall of the Luftwaffe'', a biography of Field Marshal Milch. He spent the remainder of the 1970s working on ''[[Hitler's War]]'' and ''The War Path'', his two-part biography of Adolf Hitler; ''The Trail of the Fox,'' a biography of Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]]; and a series in the ''[[Sunday Express]]'' describing the [[Royal Air Force]]'s famous [[Operation Chastise|Dam Busters]] raid. In 1975, in his introduction to ''Hitler und seine Feldherren'', the German edition of ''Hitler's War'', Irving attacked [[The Diary of a Young Girl|Anne Frank's diary]] as a forgery, claiming falsely that a New York court had ruled that the diary was really the work of American scriptwriter [[Meyer Levin]] "in collaboration with the girl's father".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=232}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revisionism==

A note in Himmler's telephone log from 30 November 1941 saying "no liquidation" was later used by Irving as the central argument trying to prove that Hitler was ignorant of the Holocaust.]]

===''Hitler's War''===
{{main|Hitler's War}}

In 1977 Irving published ''[[Hitler's War]]'', the first of his two-part biography of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Irving's intention in ''Hitler's War'' was to clean away the "years of grime and discoloration from the facade of a silent and forbidding monument" to reveal the real Hitler, whose reputation Irving argued had been slandered by historians.&lt;ref name="Craig 72"&gt;{{Harvnb|Craig|1982|p=72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Hitler's War'', Irving tried to "view the situation as far as possible through Hitler's eyes, from behind his desk".&lt;ref name="Craig 72" /&gt; He portrayed Hitler as a rational, intelligent politician, whose only goal was to increase Germany's prosperity and influence on the continent, and who was constantly let down by incompetent and/or treasonous subordinates.&lt;ref name="Craig 72" /&gt; Irving's book faulted the Allied leaders, especially [[Winston Churchill]], for the eventual escalation of war, and argued that the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941 was a "[[preventive war]]" forced on Hitler to avert an alleged impending Soviet attack.&lt;ref name="Evans 1989 166"&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1989|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also argued that Hitler had no knowledge of [[the Holocaust]]: while not denying its occurrence, Irving argued that [[Heinrich Himmler]] and his deputy [[Reinhard Heydrich]] were its originators and architects. Irving made much of the lack of any written order from Hitler ordering the Holocaust, and for decades afterward offered to pay £1,000 to anyone who could find such an order.&lt;ref name="Guttenplan 46"&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=46}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical reaction to ''Hitler's War'' was generally negative. Reviewers took issue with Irving's factual claims as well as his conclusions. For example, American historian Charles Sydnor noted numerous errors in ''Hitler's War'', such as Irving's unreferenced statement that the Jews who fought in the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] of 1943 were well supplied with weapons from Germany's allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sydnor|1979| p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sydnor pointed out that Hitler had received an SS report in November 1942 which contained a mention of 363,211 Russian Jews executed by the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' between August–November 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sydnor|1979| pp=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sydnor remarked that Irving's statement that the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were in charge in the [[Extermination camp|death camps]] seems to indicate that he was not familiar with the history of the Holocaust, as the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were in fact mobile death squads who had nothing to do with the death camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sydnor|1979 |p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irving's work of the late 1970s and early 1980s===
Just months after the initial release of ''Hitler's War'', Irving published ''The Trail of the Fox'', a biography of [[Generalfeldmarschall|Field Marshal]] [[Erwin Rommel]]. In it, Irving attacked the members of the [[20 July Plot]] to assassinate Hitler, branding them "traitors", "cowards", and "manipulators", and uncritically presented Hitler and his government's subsequent revenge against the plotters, of which Rommel was also a victim. In particular, Irving accused Rommel's friend and Chief of Staff General [[Hans Speidel]] of framing Rommel in the attempted coup. The British historian [[David Pryce-Jones]] in a book review of ''The Trail of the Fox'' in the edition of 12 November 1977 of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' accused Irving of taking everything Hitler had to say at face value.&lt;ref name="adl profile"/&gt;

In 1978, Irving released ''The War Path'', the companion volume to ''Hitler's War'' which covered events leading up to the war and which was written from a similar point of view. Again, professional historians such as Donald Cameron Watt noted numerous inaccuracies and misrepresentations. Despite the criticism, the book sold well, as did all of Irving's books to that date. The financial success of his books enabled Irving to buy a home in the prestigious [[Mayfair]] district of London, own a [[Rolls-Royce (car)|Rolls-Royce]] car, and to enjoy a very affluent lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Irving, despite being married, became increasingly open about his affairs with other women, all of which were detailed in his self-published diary.&lt;ref name="Guttenplan 51"&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Irving's affairs were to cause his first marriage to end in divorce in 1981. In 1992, Irving began a relationship with a Danish model, Bente Hogh. Hogh and Irving live together, and are the parents of a daughter born in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1511329/Irvings-girlfriend-is-left-homeless-and-bitter.html |title=Irving's girlfriend is left homeless and bitter |date=24 February 2006 |last=Tweedie |first=Neil |work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s Irving started researching and writing about topics other than Nazi Germany, but with less success. He began his research on his three-part biography of [[Winston Churchill]]. After publication Irving's work on Churchill received at least one bad review from Professor [[David Cannadine]] (then of the [[University of London]]):

{{quote|It has received almost no attention from historians or reviewers ... It is easy to see why ... full of excesses, inconsistencies and omissions ... seems completely unaware of recent work done on the subject ... It is not merely that the arguments in this book are so perversely tendentious and irresponsibly sensationalist. It is also that it is written in a tone which is at best casually journalistic and at worst quite exceptionally offensive. The text is littered with errors from beginning to end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/i/irving-david/ |title=David Irving: Britain's Holocaust "revisionist" |publisher=Nizkor.org |accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1981, he published two books. The first was ''The War Between the Generals'', in which Irving offered an account of the Allied High Command on the Western Front in 1944–45, detailing the heated conflicts Irving alleges occurred between the various generals of the various countries and presenting rumours about their private lives. The second book was ''Uprising!'', about the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|1956 revolt in Hungary]], which Irving characterised as "primarily an anti-Jewish uprising", supposedly because the Communist regime was itself controlled by Jews. Irving's depiction of Hungary's Communist regime as a Jewish dictatorship oppressing [[Gentiles]] sparked charges of [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref name="Guttenplan 47"&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=47}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there were complaints that Irving had grossly exaggerated the number of people of Jewish origin in the Communist regime and had ignored the fact that [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] Communists who did have a Jewish background like [[Mátyás Rákosi]] and [[Ernő Gerő]] had totally repudiated Judaism and sometimes expressed antisemitic attitudes themselves.&lt;ref name="observer 1981"/&gt; Critics such as [[Neal Ascherson]] and [[Kai Bird]] took issue with some of Irving's language that seemed to evoke antisemitic imagery, such as his remark that Rákosi possessed "the tact of a [[kosher]] butcher".&lt;ref name="Guttenplan 47" /&gt;

===Hitler Diaries===
In 1983, ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'', a weekly German news magazine, purchased the [[Hitler Diaries]] of 61 volumes for [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 9 million and published excerpts from them. Irving played the main role in exposing the Hitler Diaries as a hoax. In October 1982, Irving purchased, from the same source as ''Stern'''s 1983 purchase, 800 pages of documents relating to Hitler, only to conclude that many of the documents were forgeries.&lt;ref name="Evans 2001 19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|2001|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Irving was amongst the first to identify the diaries as forgeries, and to draw media attention. He went so far as to crash the press conference held by [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] at the [[Hamburg]] offices of ''Stern'' magazine on 25 April 1983 to denounce the diaries as a forgery and Trevor-Roper for endorsing the diaries as genuine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Irving's performance at the ''Stern'' press conference where he violently harangued Trevor-Roper until ejected by security led him to be featured prominently on the news: the next day, Irving appeared on the ''Today'' television show as a featured guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|1986|pp=320–323}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Irving had concluded that the alleged Hitler diaries were a forgery because they had come from the same dealer in Nazi memorabilia from whom Irving had purchased his collection in 1982.&lt;ref name="Evans 2001 19" /&gt; At the press conference in Hamburg, Irving announced, "I know the collection from which these diaries come. It is an old collection, full of forgeries. I have some here".&lt;ref name="Evans 2001 19" /&gt; Irving was proud to have detected and announced the hoax material and of the "trail of chaos" he had created at the Hamburg press conference and the attendant publicity it had brought him, and took pride in his humiliation of Trevor-Roper, whom Irving strongly disliked for his sloppy work (not detecting the hoax) and criticism of Irving's methods and conclusions.&lt;ref name="Pelt 22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Irving also noted internal inconsistencies in the supposed Hitler diaries, such as a diary entry for [[July 20 plot|July 20, 1944]], which would have been unlikely given that Hitler's right hand had been badly burned by the bomb planted in his headquarters by Colonel [[Claus von Stauffenberg]] earlier that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|2005|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A week later on 2 May, Irving asserted that many of the diary documents appear to be genuine: at the same press conference, Irving took the opportunity to promote his translation of the memoirs of Hitler's physician Dr. [[Theodor Morell]].&lt;ref name="Pelt 22" /&gt; [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]], in his book ''Selling Hitler'', suggested that an additional reason for Irving's change of mind over the authenticity of the alleged Hitler diaries was that the fake diaries contain no reference to the Holocaust, thereby buttressing Irving's claim in ''Hitler's War'' that Hitler had no knowledge of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Harris|1986|pp=338–339}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Irving conformed when the diaries were declared as a forgery by consensus. At a press conference held to withdraw his endorsement of the diaries, Irving proudly claimed that he was the first to call them a forgery, to which a reporter replied that he was also the last to call them genuine.&lt;ref name="Pelt 22" /&gt;

===Other books===
By the mid-1980s, Irving had not had a successful book for some years, and was behind schedule in writing the first volume of his Churchill series, the research for which had strained his finances.&lt;ref name="Guttenplan 56"&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He finished the manuscript in 1985, but the book was not published until 1987, when it was released as ''Churchill's War, Volume I''.

In 1989, Irving published his biography of [[Hermann Göring]].

==Holocaust denial==

===Movement towards Holocaust denial===
Over the years, Irving's stance on the Holocaust changed significantly. From 1988, he started to espouse [[Holocaust denial]] openly: he had previously not denied the Holocaust outright and for this reason, many Holocaust deniers were ambivalent about him.&lt;ref name="Pelt 21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They admired Irving for the pro-Nazi slant in his work and the fact that he possessed a degree of mainstream credibility that they lacked, but were annoyed that he did not openly deny the Holocaust. In 1980, [[Lucy Dawidowicz]] noted that although ''Hitler's War'' was strongly sympathetic to the Third Reich, because Irving argued that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust as opposed to denying the Holocaust happened at all, his book was not part of the "anti-Semitic canon".&lt;ref&gt;Dawidowicz, Lucy "Lies About the Holocaust" pages 31–37 from ''Commentary'', Volume 70, Issue # 6, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Irving received an invitation to speak at a Holocaust-denial conference, which he refused on the grounds that his appearance there would damage his reputation.&lt;ref name="Pelt 21" /&gt; In a letter, Irving stated his reasons for his refusal as: "This is pure ''[[Realpolitik]]'' on my part. I am already dangerously exposed, and I cannot take the chance of being caught in flak meant for others!"&lt;ref name="Pelt 21" /&gt; Though Irving refused at this time to appear at conferences sponsored by the Holocaust-denying [[Institute for Historical Review]] (IHR), he did grant the institute the right to distribute his books in the United States.&lt;ref name="Pelt 21" /&gt; [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] suggests that the major reason for Irving wishing to keep his distance from Holocaust deniers in the early 1980s was his desire to found his own political party called Focus.&lt;ref name="Pelt 21" /&gt;

In a footnote in the first edition of ''Hitler's War'', Irving writes, "I cannot accept the view… [that] there exists no document signed by Hitler, Himmler or [[Reinhard Heydrich|Heydrich]] speaking of the extermination of the Jews". In 1982, Irving made an attempt to unify all of the various neo-Nazi groups in Britain into one party called Focus, in which he would play a leading role.&lt;ref name="Evans 1989 166" /&gt; Irving described himself as a "moderate fascist" and spoke of plans to become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 161"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=161}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The effort failed due to fiscal problems.&lt;ref name="Evans 1989 166" /&gt; Irving told the ''[[Oxford Mail]]'' of having "links at a low level" with the [[National Front (UK)|British National Front]].&lt;ref name="Evans 1989 166" /&gt; Irving described ''[[The Spotlight]]'', the main journal of the [[Liberty Lobby]], as "an excellent fortnightly paper".&lt;ref name="Evans 1989 166" /&gt; At the same time, Irving put a copy of Hitler's "Prophecy Speech" of 30 January 1939, promising the "annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe" if "Jewish financiers" started another world war, onto his wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1989|p=167}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the failure of Focus, in September 1983, Irving for the first time attended a conference of the IHR.&lt;ref name="Pelt 21" /&gt; Van Pelt has argued that, with the failure of Irving's political career, he felt freer to associate with Holocaust deniers.&lt;ref name="Pelt 21" /&gt; At the conference, Irving did not deny the Holocaust, but did appear happy to share the stage with [[Robert Faurisson]] and Judge [[Wilhelm Stäglich]], and claimed to be impressed with the allegations of Friedrich Berg that [[mass murder]] using [[Diesel fuel|diesel gas fumes]] at the [[Operation Reinhard]] death camps was impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|pp=22–23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At that conference, Irving repeated his claims that Hitler was ignorant of the Holocaust because he was "so busy being a soldier".&lt;ref name="Pelt 23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech at that conference, Irving stated: "Isn't it right for Tel Aviv to claim now that David Irving is talking nonsense and ''of course'' Adolf Hitler must have known about what was going in Auschwitz and Treblinka, and then in the same breath to claim that, ''of course'' our beloved [[Menachem Begin|Mr. Begin]] didn't know what was going on in [[Sabra and Shatila massacre|Sabra and Chatilla]]".&lt;ref name="Pelt 23" /&gt; During the same speech, Irving proclaimed Hitler to be the "biggest friend the Jews had in the Third Reich".&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 162"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same speech, Irving stated that he operated in such a way as to bring himself maximum publicity. Irving stated that: "I have at home... a filing cabinet full of documents which I don't issue all at once. I keep them: I issue them a bit at a time. When I think my name hasn't been in the newspapers for several weeks, well, then I ring them up and I phone them and I say: 'What about this one, then?'"&lt;ref name="Pelt 23" /&gt;

A major theme of Irving's writings from the 1980s was his belief that it had been a great blunder on the part of Britain to declare war on Germany in 1939, and that ever since then and as a result of that decision, Britain had slipped into an unstoppable decline.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 161" /&gt; Irving also took the view that Hitler often tried to help the Jews of Europe.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 161" /&gt; In a June 1992 interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Irving claimed to have heard from Hitler's naval adjutant that the ''Führer'' had told him that he could not marry because Germany was "his bride".&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 161" /&gt; Irving then claimed to have asked the naval adjutant when Hitler made that remark, and upon hearing that the date was 24 March 1938, Irving stated in response "Herr Admiral, at that moment I was being born". Irving used this alleged incident to argue that there was some sort of mystical connection between himself and Hitler.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 161-162"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|pp=161–162}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1986 speech in Australia Irving argued that photographs of Holocaust survivors and dead taken in early 1945 by Allied soldiers were proof that the Allies were responsible for the Holocaust, not the Germans.&lt;ref name="Pelt 40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Irving claimed that the Holocaust was not the work of Nazi leaders, but rather of "nameless criminals",&lt;ref name="Pelt 40" /&gt; and claimed that "these men [who killed the Jews] acted on their own impulse, their own initiative, within the general atmosphere of brutality created by the Second World War, in which of course Allied bombings played a part."&lt;ref name="Pelt 40" /&gt; In another 1986 speech, this time in [[Atlanta]], Irving claimed that "historians have a blindness when it comes to the Holocaust because like [[Tay-Sachs disease]] it is a Jewish disease which causes blindness".&lt;ref name=s32&gt;{{Harvnb|Stern |1992 |p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1980s, Irving associated himself with the IHR, began giving lectures to groups such as the far-right German [[Deutsche Volksunion]] (DVU), and publicly denied that the Nazis systematically exterminated Jews in gas chambers during World War II.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 8"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Irving was present at a memorial service for [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]] in January 1983 after the latter's death, organised by the DVU and Frey, delievering a speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 January 1983|title=Big crowd commemorates death of Nazi pilot|trans-title=|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/01/09/Big-crowd-commemorates-death-of-Nazi-pilot/7256410936400/|language=|work=[[United Press International]]|location= |access-date=27 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gedenkveranstaltung für Hans Ulrich Rudel, 1983|trans-title=Memorial service for Hans Ulrich Rudel, 1983|url=https://www.sz-photo.de/?16607724099100603390&amp;EVENT=POPUP&amp;WINDOW=WGWINe4704873e01b6fac8cb1c19fdf7143a9&amp;AJXUID=0.7987179042092476&amp;MEDIANUMBER=00325558&amp;MEDIAITEMS=667e82876af943c49f10de114a6d270cc7811f83&amp;OMG=fde34952c756&amp;PAGING_SCOPE_4=29&amp;MEDIAGROUP_SCOPE=1|language=German|work=[[Sueddeutsche Zeitung]]|location= |access-date=28 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was given the Hans-Ulrich-Rudel-Award by Frey in June 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Funke: David Irving, Holocaust denial, and his connections to right wing extremists and neo-national socialism (neo-nazism) in Germany|trans-title=|url=https://www.hdot.org/funke/|language=|work=[[Emory University]]|location= |access-date=27 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Irving was a frequent speaker for the DVU in the 1980s and the early 1990s, but the relationship ended in 1993 apparently because of concerns by the DVU that Irving's espousal of Holocaust denial might lead to the DVU being banned.&lt;ref name="adl profile"/&gt;

In 1986, Irving visited Toronto, where he was met at the airport by Holocaust denier [[Ernst Zündel]].&lt;ref name="Pelt 41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Zündel, Irving "thought I was 'Revisionist-Neo-Nazi-Rambo-Kook!'", and asked Zündel to stay away from him.&lt;ref name="Pelt 41" /&gt; Zündel and his supporters obliged Irving by staying away from his lecture tour, which consequently attracted little media attention, and was considered by Irving to be a failure.&lt;ref name="Pelt 41" /&gt; Afterwards, Zündel sent Irving a long letter in which he offered to draw publicity to Irving, and so ensure that his future speaking tours would be a success.&lt;ref name="Pelt 41"/&gt; As a result, Irving and Zündel became friends, and Irving agreed in late 1987 to testify for Zündel at his second trial for denying the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the publication in 1987 of the book ''Der europäische Bürgerkrieg 1917–1945'' by [[Ernst Nolte]], in which Nolte strongly implied that maybe Holocaust deniers were on to something, encouraged Irving to become more open in associating with Zündel.&lt;ref name="Pelt 41" /&gt;

===Zündel trial===
In January 1988, Irving travelled to Toronto, Ontario, to assist [[Doug Christie (lawyer)|Douglas Christie]], the defence lawyer for [[Ernst Zündel]] at his [[R. v. Zundel|second trial]] for denying the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 161" /&gt; Working closely with [[Robert Faurisson]], who was also assisting the defence, Irving contacted Warden Bill Armontrout of the Missouri State Penitentiary who recommended that Irving and Faurisson get into touch with [[Fred A. Leuchter]], a self-described execution expert living in Boston.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 162" /&gt; Irving and Faurisson then flew to Boston to meet with Leuchter, who agreed to lend his alleged technical expertise on the behalf of Zündel's defence.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 161" /&gt; Irving argued that an alleged expert on gassings like Leuchter could prove that the Holocaust was a "myth".&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 161" /&gt; After work on the second Zündel trial, Irving declared that based on his exposure to Zündel's and Leuchter's theories that he was now conducting a "one-man ''[[wikt:intifada|intifada]]''" against the idea that there had been a Holocaust.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 179"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=179}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Irving claimed to the American journalist [[DD Guttenplan|D.D. Guttenplan]] in a 1999 interview that Zündel had convinced him that the Holocaust had not occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1988 Zündel trial, Irving repeated and defended his claim from ''Hitler's War'' that until October 1943 Hitler knew nothing about the actual implementation of the [[Final Solution]]. He also expressed his evolving belief that the Final Solution involved "[[war crimes|atrocities]]", not systematic murder: "I don't think there was any overall ''Reich'' policy to kill the Jews. If there was, they would have been killed and there would not be now so many millions of survivors. And believe me, I am glad for every survivor that there was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihr.org/books/kulaszka/35irving.html |title=The 'False News' Trial of Ernst Zündel – 1988: David Irving |publisher=Ihr.org |accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22–26 April 1988, Irving testified for Zündel, endorsing [[Richard Verrall|Richard Harwood]]'s book ''[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]'' as "over ninety percent... factually accurate".&lt;ref name="Pelt 44"&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As to what evidence further led Irving to believe that the Holocaust never occurred, he cited ''The [[Leuchter report]]'' by Fred A. Leuchter, which claimed there was no evidence for the existence of homicidal [[gas chamber]]s at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Irving said in a 1999 documentary about Leuchter: "The big point [of the Leuchter report]: there is no significant residue of [[cyanide]] in the brickwork. That's what converted me. When I read that in the report in the courtroom in Toronto, I became a hard-core disbeliever".&lt;ref&gt;''Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr.''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Irving was influenced to embrace Holocaust denial by the American historian [[Arno J. Mayer]]'s 1988 book ''Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?'', which did not deny the Holocaust, but claimed that most of those who died at Auschwitz were killed by disease: Irving saw in Mayer's book an apparent confirmation of Leuchter's and Zündel's theories about no mass murder at Auschwitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|pp=47–48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the trial, Irving published Leuchter's report as ''Auschwitz The End of the Line: The Leuchter Report'' in the United Kingdom in 1989 and wrote its foreword.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 179" /&gt; Leuchter's book had been first published in Canada by Zündel's [[Samisdat Publishers]] in 1988 as ''The Leuchter Report: The End of a Myth: An Engineering Report on the Alleged Execution Gas Chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau and Majdanek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=260}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his foreword to the British edition of Leuchter's book, Irving wrote that "Nobody likes to be swindled, still less where considerable sums of money are involved".&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 179" /&gt; The alleged swindle was the [[Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany|reparations]] money totalling 3 billion DM paid by the Federal Republic of Germany to Israel between 1952–1966 for the Holocaust. Irving described the reparations as being "essentially in atonement for the 'gas chambers' of Auschwitz", which Irving called a "myth" that would "not die easily".&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 179" /&gt; In his foreword, Irving praised the "scrupulous methods" and "integrity" of Leuchter.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 179" /&gt;

For publishing and writing the foreword to ''Auschwitz The End of the Line'', on 20 June 1989 Irving together with Leuchter was condemned in an [[Early Day Motion]] of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] as "Hitler's heirs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|pp=179–180}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The motion went on to describe Irving as a "Nazi propagandist and longtime Hitler apologist" and ''Auschwitz The End of the Line'' as a "fascist publication".&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 180" /&gt; In the Motion, the House stated that they were "appalled by [the Holocaust denial of] Nazi propagandist and long-time Hitler apologist David Irving".&lt;ref name=s32/&gt; In response to the House of Commons motion, Irving in a press statement challenged the MPs who voted to condemn him, writing that: "I will enter the 'gas chambers' of Auschwitz and you and your friends may lob in [[Zyklon B]] in accordance with the well known procedures and conditions. I guarantee that you won't be satisfied with the results!".&lt;ref name="Brinks, Jan Hermann page 107"&gt;Brinks, Jan Hermann ''Children of a New Fatherland'', London: I.B. Tauris, 2000 p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pamphlet Irving published in London on 23 June 1989, he made the "epochal announcement" that there was no mass murder in the gas chambers at the Auschwitz death camp.&lt;ref name="Pelt 48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Irving labelled the gas chambers at Auschwitz a "hoax", and writing in the third person declared that he "has placed himself [Irving] at the head of a growing band of historians, worldwide, who are now sceptical of the claim that at Auschwitz and other camps were 'factories of death', in which millions of innocent people were systematically gassed to death".&lt;ref name="Pelt 48" /&gt; Boasting of his role in criticising the Hitler diaries as a forgery in 1983, Irving wrote "now he [Irving] is saying the same thing about the infamous 'gas chambers' of Auschwitz, Treblinka and Majdanek. They did not exist – ever – except perhaps as the brainchild of Britain's brilliant wartime Psychological Warfare Executive".&lt;ref name="Pelt 48" /&gt; Finally, Irving claimed "the survivors of Auschwitz are themselves testimony to the absence of an extermination programme".&lt;ref name="Pelt 48" /&gt; Echoing the criticism of the House of Commons, a leader in ''[[The Times]]'' on 14 May 1990 described Irving as a "man for whom Hitler is something of a hero and almost everything of an innocent and for whom Auschwitz is a Jewish deception".&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 180" /&gt;

[[File:Aushwitz I gas chamber memorial.jpg|thumb|275px|Interior of the gas chamber of Auschwitz I camp. In a 1990 speech, Irving stated: "I say the following thing: there were no gas chambers in Auschwitz. There have been only mock-ups built by the Poles in the years after the war."&lt;ref name="Pelt 55" /&gt;]]

===Holocaust denial lecture circuit===
In the early 1990s, Irving was a frequent visitor to Germany, where he spoke at neo-Nazi rallies.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 8" /&gt; The chief themes of Irving's German speeches were that the Allies and Axis states were equally culpable for war crimes, that the decision of [[Neville Chamberlain]] to declare war on Germany in 1939, and that of [[Winston Churchill]] to continue the war in 1940, had been great mistakes that set Britain on a path of decline, and the Holocaust was just a "propaganda exercise".&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 8" /&gt; In June 1990, Irving visited [[East Germany]] on a well-publicized tour entitled "An Englishman Fights for the Honour of the Germans," on which he accused the Allies of having used "forged documents" to "humiliate" the German people.&lt;ref name="Brinks, Jan Hermann page 107"/&gt; Irving's self-proclaimed mission was to guide "promising young men" in Germany in the "right direction" (Irving has often stated his belief that women exist for a "certain task, which is producing us [men]", and should be "subservient to men": leading, in Lipstadt's view, to a lack of interest on Irving's part in guiding young German women in the "right direction").&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; German nationalists found Irving, as a non-German Holocaust denier, to be particularly credible.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 16" /&gt;

In January 1990, Irving gave a speech in [[Moers]] where he asserted that only 30,000 people died at Auschwitz between 1940–45, all of natural causes, which was equal—so he claimed—to the typical death toll from one Bomber Command raid on German cities.&lt;ref name="Pelt 55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Irving claimed that there were no gas chambers at the death camp, stating that the existing remains were "mock-ups built by the Poles".&lt;ref name="Pelt 55" /&gt; On 21 April 1990, Irving repeated the same speech in [[Munich]], which led to his conviction for Holocaust denial in Munich on 11 July 1991. The court fined Irving DM 7,000. Irving appealed the judgement, and received a fine of DM 10,000 for repeating the same remarks in the courtroom on 5 May 1992.&lt;ref name="Pelt 55" /&gt; During his appeal in 1992, Irving called upon those present in the Munich courtroom to "fight a battle for the German people and put an end to the blood lie of the Holocaust which has been told against this country for fifty years".&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 179" /&gt; Irving went on to call the Auschwitz death camp a "tourist attraction" whose origins Irving claimed went back to an "ingenious plan" devised by the British Psychological Warfare Executive in 1942 to spread anti-German propaganda that it was the policy of the German state to be "using 'gas chambers' to kill millions of Jews and other undesirables".&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 179" /&gt; During the same speech, Irving denounced the judge as a "[[senile]], alcoholic cretin".&lt;ref name="Shermer Grobman 50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shermer|Grobman|2002|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his conviction for Holocaust denial, Irving was banned from visiting Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=221}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Auschwitz Birkenau German Nazi Concentration and Extermination Camp (1940-1945)-107820.jpg|left|thumb|275px|Inside a barracks in [[Auschwitz II Birkenau]]. In 1992 during his appeal for his conviction for Holocaust denial, Irving called Auschwitz a "tourist attraction".&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 179"/&gt;]]

Expanding upon his thesis in ''Hitler's War'' about the lack of a written ''Führer'' order for the Holocaust, Irving argued in the 1990s that the absence of such an order meant that there was no Holocaust.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum 233"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosenbaum|1999|p=233}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech delivered in Toronto in November 1990 Irving claimed that Holocaust survivors had manufactured memories of their suffering because "there's money involved and they can get a good compensation cash payment out of it".&lt;ref name="adl profile"/&gt; In that speech, Irving used the metaphor of a cruise ship named Holocaust, which Irving claimed had "... luxury wall to wall fitted carpets and a crew of thousands… marine terminals established in now virtually every capital in the world, disguised as Holocaust memorial museums".&lt;ref name="Pelt 57" /&gt; Irving went on to assert that the "ship" was due for rough sailing because recently the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government had allowed historians access to "the index cards of all the people who passed through the gates of Auschwitz", and claimed that this would lead to "a lot of people [who] are not claiming to be Auschwitz survivors anymore" (Irving's statement about the index cards was incorrect: what the Soviet government had made available in 1990 were the death books of Auschwitz, recording the weekly death tolls).&lt;ref name="Pelt 57" /&gt; Irving claimed on the basis of what he called the index books that, "Because the experts can look at a tattoo and say 'Oh yes, 181, 219 that means you entered Auschwitz in March 1943" and he warned Auschwitz survivors "If you want to go and have a tattoo put on your arm, as a lot of them do, I am afraid to say, and claim subsequently that you were in Auschwitz, you have to make sure a) that it fits in with the month you said you went to Auschwitz and b) it is not a number which anyone used before".&lt;ref name="Pelt 57" /&gt;

On 17 January 1991, Irving told a reporter from ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' that "The Jews are very foolish not to abandon the gas chamber theory while they still have time".&lt;ref name=s33&gt;{{Harnvb|Stern|1992|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irving went on to say that he believed anti-Semitism will increase all over the world because "the Jews have exploited people with the gas chamber legend" and that "In ten years, Israel will cease to exist and the Jews will have to return to Europe".&lt;ref name=s33/&gt; In his 1991 revised edition of ''Hitler's War'', he had removed all references to [[death camp]]s and the Holocaust. In a speech given in [[Hamburg]] in 1991, Irving stated that in two years time "this myth of mass murders of Jews in the death factories of Auschwitz, [[Majdanek]] and [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] ... which in fact never took place" will be disproved (Auschwitz, Majdanek, and Treblinka were all well established as being [[extermination camp]]s).&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum 222"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosenbaum|1999|p=222}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Irving repeated the same speech in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] before a group of neo-Nazis, and praised [[Rudolf Hess]] as "that great German martyr, Rudolf Hess".&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum 222" /&gt; At another 1991 speech, this time in Canada, Irving called the Holocaust a "hoax", and again predicted that by 1993 the "hoax" would have been "exposed".&lt;ref name="Pelt 57" /&gt; In that speech, Irving declared, "Gradually the word is getting around Germany. Two years from now too, the German historians will accept that we are right. They will accept that for fifty years they have believed a lie".&lt;ref name="Pelt 57"&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=57}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During that speech given in October 1991, Irving expressed his contempt and hatred for Holocaust survivors by proclaiming that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ridicule alone isn't enough, you've got to be tasteless about it. You've got to say things like 'More women died on the back seat of [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]]'s car at [[Chappaquiddick incident|Chappaquiddick]] than in the gas chambers at Auschwitz.' Now you think that's tasteless, what about this? I'm forming an association especially dedicated to all these liars, the ones who try and kid people that they were in these concentration camps, it's called the Auschwitz Survivors, Survivors of the Holocaust and Other Liars, 'ASSHOLs'. Can't get more tasteless than that, but you've got to be tasteless because these people deserve our contempt.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In another 1991 speech, this time in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], Irving called the Holocaust "a major fraud... There were no gas chambers. They were fakes and frauds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stern|1992|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1992, Irving was to be a featured speaker at a world [[anti zionism|anti-Zionist]] congress in [[Stockholm]] that was cancelled by the Swedish government.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 8" /&gt; Also scheduled to attend were fellow Holocaust-deniers [[Robert Faurisson]] and [[Fred A. Leuchter]], and [[Louis Farrakhan]], together with representatives of the militant Palestinian group [[Hamas]], the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] militant [[Shiite]] group [[Hezbollah]], and the right-wing Russian antisemitic group [[Pamyat]].&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 8" /&gt; In a 1993 speech, Irving claimed that there had been only 100,000 Jewish deaths at Auschwitz, "but not from gas chambers. They died from epidemics".&lt;ref name="Pelt 56"&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Irving went on to claim that most of the Jewish deaths during World War II had been caused by Allied bombing.&lt;ref name="Pelt 56" /&gt; Irving claimed that "The concentration camp inmates arrived in Berlin or [[Leipzig]] or in [[Dresden]] just in time for the [[RAF]] bombers to set fire to those cities. Nobody knows how many Jews died in those air raids".&lt;ref name="Pelt 56" /&gt; In a 1994 speech, Irving lamented that his predictions of 1991 had failed to occur, and complained of the persistence of belief in the "rotting corpse" of the "profitable legend" of the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="Pelt 57" /&gt; In another 1994 speech, Irving claimed that there was no German policy of genocide of Jews, and that only 600,000 Jews died in concentration camps in World War II, all due to either Allied bombing or disease.&lt;ref name="Shermer Grobman 50" /&gt; At the same time, Irving started to appear more frequently at the annual conferences hosted by the IHR.&lt;ref name="Shermer Grobman 49-50"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shermer|Grobman|2002|pp=49–50}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1995 speech, Irving claimed that the Holocaust was a myth invented by a "world-wide Jewish cabal" to serve their own ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shermer|Grobman|2002|p=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Irving also spoke on other topics at the IHR gatherings. A frequent theme was the claim that [[Winston Churchill]] had advance knowledge of the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] plans to attack [[Pearl Harbor]], and refused to warn the Americans, in order to bring the United States into World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shermer|Grobman|2002|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Irving maintained an ambivalent attitude to Holocaust denial depending on his audience. In a 1993 letter, Irving lashed out against his former friend Zündel, writing that: "In April 1988 I unhesitatingly agreed to aid your defence as a witness in Toronto. ''I would not make the same mistake again''. As a penalty for having defended you then, and for having continued to aid you since, my life has come under a gradually mounting attack: I find myself the worldwide victim of mass demonstrations, violence, vituperation and persecution" (emphasis in the original). Irving went on to claim his life had been wonderful until Zündel had got him involved in the Holocaust denial movement: van Pelt argues that Irving was just trying to shift responsibility for his actions in his letter.&lt;ref name="Pelt 56"/&gt; In an interview with Australian radio in July 1995, Irving claimed that at least four million Jews died in World War II, though he argued that this was due to terrible sanitary conditions inside the concentration camps as opposed to a deliberate policy of genocide in the death camps.&lt;ref name="Shermer Grobman 50" /&gt; Irving's statement led to a very public spat with his former ally Faurisson, who insisted that no Jews were killed in the Holocaust.&lt;ref name="Pelt 56" /&gt; In 1995, Irving stated in another speech that "I have to take off my hat to my adversaries and the strategies they have employed—the marketing of the very word Holocaust: I half expected to see a little [[Trademark symbol|TM]] after it".&lt;ref name="Shermer Grobman 50" /&gt; Likewise, depending on his audience, during the 1990s Irving either used the absence of a written ''Führerbefehl'' (Führer order) for the "Final Solution" to argue that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust, or claimed that the absence of a written order meant there was no Holocaust at all.&lt;ref name="Shermer Grobman 49-50" /&gt;

==Racism and antisemitism==
Irving has expressed [[racism|racist]] and antisemitic sentiments, both publicly and privately. Irving has often expressed his belief in the theory of a sinister Jewish conspiracy ruling the world, and that the belief in the reality of Holocaust was manufactured as part of the same alleged conspiracy.&lt;ref name="Guttenplan 51" /&gt; Irving used the label "traditional enemies of the truth" to describe Jews, and in a 1963 article about a speech by Sir [[Oswald Mosley]] wrote that the "Yellow Star did not make a showing".&lt;ref name="Guttenplan 51" /&gt; In 1992, Irving stated that "the Jews are very foolish not to abandon the gas chamber theory while they still have time" and claimed he "foresees a new wave of antisemitism" the world over due to Jewish "exploitation of the Holocaust myth".&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 180" /&gt; During an interview with the American writer [[Ron Rosenbaum]], Irving restated his belief that Jews were his "traditional enemy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosenbaum|1999|p=234}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In one interview cited in the libel lawsuit, Irving also stated that he would be "willing to put [his] signature" to the "fact" that "a great deal of control over the world is exercised by Jews".&lt;ref name="vs"&gt;Interview for ''This Week'', 28 November 1991. pp. 7–8. Cited by [[s:David Irving v Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt/IX|''David Irving v. Penguin Books and Sarah Lipstadt''. IX: JUSTIFICATION: THE ALLEGATION THAT IRVING IS AN ANTI-SEMITE AND A RACIST]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of these statements were cited by the judge's decision in Irving's lawsuit against [[Irving v Penguin Books Ltd|Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt,]]&lt;ref name="vs" /&gt; leading the judge to conclude that Irving "had on many occasions spoken in terms which are plainly racist."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/709517.stm "Judge: Why Irving had to lose"], [[BBC News]], 11 April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; One example brought was his diary entry for 17 September 1994, in which Irving wrote about a ditty he composed for his young daughter "when halfbreed children are wheeled past":

{{poemquote|

After Irving denied the Holocaust in two 1989 speeches given in Austria, the Austrian government issued an arrest warrant for him and barred him from entering the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/farright/story/0,,1714403,00.html |title=Irving jailed for denying Holocaust &amp;#124; The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian&lt;! |accessdate=20 September 2009|location=London|first=Ian|last=Traynor|date=21 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1992, a German court found him guilty of Holocaust denial under the ''Auschwitzlüge'' section of the law against ''[[Volksverhetzung]]'' (a failed appeal by Irving would see the fine rise from 10,000 DM to 30,000 DM), and he was subsequently barred from entering Germany.&lt;ref name="adl profile"/&gt; Other governments followed suit, including Italy and Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Duff, Oliver. [http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article346741.ece " David Irving: An anti-Semitic racist who has suffered financial ruin"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422204331/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article346741.ece |date=22 April 2007 }}, ''The Independent'', 21 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; where he was arrested in November 1992 and deported to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="adl profile"/&gt; In an administrative hearing surrounding those events, he was found by the hearing office to have engaged in a "total fabrication" in telling a story of an exit from and return to Canada which would, for technical reasons, have made the original deportation order invalid. He was also barred from entering Australia in 1992, a ban he made five unsuccessful attempts to overturn.&lt;ref&gt;''The World Today''. "[http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/stories/s96976.htm Holocaust denier to try another visit to Australia]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Irving signed a contract with [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] for a biography of [[Joseph Goebbels]] entitled ''Goebbels: Mastermind of the Third Reich''. Following charges that Irving had selectively "edited" a recently discovered complete edition of [[Goebbels Diaries|Goebbels's diaries]] in Moscow, Macmillan cancelled the book deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' (who had bought the rights to serialised extracts from the diaries before Macmillan published them) in July 1992 to hire Irving as a translator of Goebbels's diary was criticised by historian Peter Pulzer, who argued that Irving, because of his views about the Third Reich, was not the best man for the job.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 180"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|1993|p=180}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Neil]], the editor of ''The Sunday Times'', called Irving "reprehensible", but defended hiring him because he was only a "transcribing technician", which others criticised as a poor description of translation work.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 1993 180" /&gt;

On 27 April 1993, Irving was ordered to attend court to be examined on charges relating to the ''[[Loi Gayssot]]'' in France, making it an offence to question the existence or size of the category of crimes against humanity. The law does not extend to [[extradition]], and Irving refused to travel to France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpp.co.uk/bookchapters/Global/Vendetta.html |title=His website |publisher=Fpp.co.uk |accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in February 1994, Irving spent 10 days of a three-month sentence in London's [[Pentonville prison]] for [[contempt of court]] following a legal wrangling over publishing rights.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Felding.

In 1995, [[St. Martin's Press]] of New York City agreed to publish the Goebbels biography: but after protests, they cancelled the contract, leaving Irving in a situation in which, according to [[D. D. Guttenplan]], he was desperate for financial help, publicity, and the need to re-establish his reputation as a historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|pp=56–57}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was eventually self-published.

===Libel suit===
{{Main|Irving v Penguin Books Ltd}}
{{wikisource|David Irving v Penguin Books and Deborah Lipstadt}}

On 5 September 1996, Irving filed a libel suit against [[Deborah Lipstadt]] and her British publisher Penguin Books for publishing the British edition of Lipstadt's book, ''[[Denying the Holocaust]]'', which had first been published in the United States in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Pelt|2002|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Lipstadt called Irving a Holocaust denier, falsifier, and bigot, and said that he manipulated and distorted real documents.

Lipstadt hired the British solicitor [[Anthony Julius]] to present her case, while Penguin Books hired Kevin Bays and Mark Bateman, libel specialist from media firm [[Davenport Lyons]]. They briefed the libel barrister [[Richard Rampton]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] and Penguin also briefed junior barrister Heather Rogers. The defendants (with Penguin's insurers paying the fee) also retained Professor [[Richard J. Evans]], historian and Professor of Modern History at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], as an expert witness. Also working as expert witnesses were the American Holocaust historian [[Christopher Browning]], the German historian [[Peter Longerich]] and the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] architectural expert [[Robert Jan van Pelt]]. The last wrote a report attesting to the fact that the death camps were designed, built and used for the purpose of [[mass murder]], while Browning testified for the reality of the Holocaust. Evans' report was the most comprehensive, in-depth examination of Irving's work:

{{quote|Not one of &lt;nowiki&gt;[Irving's]&lt;/nowiki&gt; books, speeches or articles, not one paragraph, not one sentence in any of them, can be taken on trust as an accurate representation of its historical subject. All of them are completely worthless as history, because Irving cannot be trusted anywhere, in any of them, to give a reliable account of what he is talking or writing about ... if we mean by historian someone who is concerned to discover the truth about the past, and to give as accurate a representation of it as possible, then Irving is not a historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hdot.org/evans/#evans_6.html|work=Holocaust Denial On Trial: Expert Witness Report|title=Chapter 6. General Conclusion |last=Evans |first=Richard J. |authorlink=Richard J. Evans |accessdate=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[BBC]] quoted Evans further:-

&lt;blockquote&gt;Irving ''(...)'' had deliberately distorted and wilfully mistranslated documents, consciously used discredited testimony and falsified historical statistics.  ''(...)'' Irving has fallen so far short of the standards of scholarship customary amongst historians that he does not deserve to be called a historian at all.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker |first=Andrew |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4449948.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Profile: David Irving |publisher=BBC News |date=20 February 2006 |accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not only did Irving lose the case, but in light of the evidence presented at the trial a number of his works that had previously escaped serious scrutiny were brought to public attention. He was also ordered to pay all of Penguin's trial costs, estimated to be as much as £2 million (US$3.2 million) though it is uncertain how much of these costs he will ultimately pay.&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/709996.stm | accessdate=12 January 2011|title=Irving defiant over libel defeat|publisher=BBC News|date=12 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he did not meet these, Davenport Lyons moved to make him bankrupt on behalf of their client. He was declared bankrupt in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Vikram|last1=Dodd|last2=Guttenplan|first2=D.D.url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/mar/05/humanities.highereducation |title=Holocaust denier made bankrupt|work=The Guardian|date=5 March 2002|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lost his home, though he has been able to travel around the world despite his financial problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dodd|first=Vikram|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/may/22/irving.humanities|title=Failed libel action costs Irving his home|work=The Guardian|date= 22 May 2002|accessdate=2 September 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The libel suit was depicted in a 2016 film, ''[[Denial (2016 film)|Denial]].''

===Life after libel suit===
{{see also|Irving trial}}

Early in September 2004, [[Michael Cullen (politician)|Michael Cullen]], the [[Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand]], announced that Irving would not be permitted to visit the country, where he had been invited by the National Press Club to give a series of lectures under the heading "The Problems of Writing about World War II in a Free Society". The National Press Club defended its invitation of Irving, saying that it amounted not to an endorsement of his views, but rather an opportunity to question him. A government spokeswoman said that "people who have been deported from another country are refused entry" to New Zealand. Irving rejected the ban and attempted to board a [[Qantas]] flight for New Zealand from Los Angeles on 17 September 2004. He was not allowed on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpp.co.uk/newzealand/index2.html |title=His own website |publisher=Fpp.co.uk |accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 November 2005, the Austrian police in the southern state of [[Styria]], acting under the 1989 [[arrest warrant|warrant]], arrested Irving. Irving pleaded guilty to the charge of "trivialising, grossly playing down and denying the Holocaust". Irving stated in his plea that he changed his opinions on the Holocaust, "I said that then based on my knowledge at the time, but by 1991 when I came across the [[Adolf Eichmann|Eichmann]] papers, I wasn't saying that anymore and I wouldn't say that now. The Nazis did murder millions of Jews." Irving had obtained the papers from Hugo Byttebier, a Belgian who had served in the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] during the war and had escaped to Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-33999-2004-04-12.html|title=Página/12 :: El país :: La historia de Byttebier, otro nazi en Argentina|website=www.pagina12.com.ar|language=es|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Irving was sentenced to three years' imprisonment in accordance with the law prohibiting National Socialist activities (officially ''[[Verbotsgesetz 1947|Verbotsgesetz]]'', "Prohibition Statute").&lt;ref name="BBC 2006-02-20"&gt;{{cite news | title=Holocaust denier Irving is jailed | date=20 February 2006 |publisher=BBC News  | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/2/hi/europe/4733820.stm | accessdate =16 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Irving sat motionless as judge Peter Liebetreu asked him if he had understood the sentence, to which he replied "I'm not sure I do" before being bundled out of the court by Austrian police. Later, Irving declared himself shocked by the severity of the sentence. He had reportedly already purchased a plane ticket home to London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connolly|first=Kate|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/1511075/Irving-clutches-Hitler-book-in-court.html|title=Irving clutches Hitler book in court|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=&lt;!-- Tuesday. --&gt;21 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, Irving was released from prison, and banned from ever returning to Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2288055,00.html |title=Convicted Holocaust Denier Irving Expelled from Austria &amp;#124; 22.12.2006 |publisher=Dw-world.de |accessdate=20 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Irving's arrival in the UK he reaffirmed his position, stating that he felt  "no need any longer to show remorse" for his Holocaust views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/12/21/uk.irving.ap/index.html |title=Holocaust denier: 'No need to show remorse' |accessdate=16 January 2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116221731/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/12/21/uk.irving.ap/index.html |archivedate=16 January 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 May 2007, he was expelled from the 52nd Warsaw International Book Fair in Poland because books he took there were deemed by the organizers as promoting [[Nazism]] and antisemitism, which is in violation of Polish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/05/18/europe/EU-GEN-Poland-Irving.php |title=British writer David Irving asked to leave Polish book fair |work=International Herald Tribune |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=20 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Irving has continued to work as a freelance writer, despite his troubled public image. He was drawn into the controversy surrounding Bishop [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]], who in a televised interview recorded in Germany in November 2008 denied the Holocaust took place, only to see Williamson convicted for incitement in April 2010 after refusing to pay a fine of  €12,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pidd|first=Helen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/26/british-bishop-holocaust-fine |title=German court fines British bishop for Holocaust claims |work=The Guardian  |accessdate=10 May 2011|date=26 October 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mail&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1226673/British-bishop-Richard-Williamson-trial-Germany-Holocaust-denial.html |title=British bishop Richard Williamson to go on trial in Germany for Holocaust denial |work=Daily Mail |author= Hall, Allan|date=10 November 2009 |accessdate=10 May 2011 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MSNBC2010&gt;{{cite news|title=British bishop convicted of Holocaust denial: German court fines cleric $13,000 for saying Jews were not gassed to death|date=16 April 2010|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36595788|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irving subsequently found himself beset by protesters on a book tour of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Solomont, E.

Irving established a website selling [[Nazi memorabilia]] in 2009. The items are offered by other people, with Irving receiving a commission from each sale for authenticating them.

=== Controversy in Norway, 2008 ===
In October 2008 a controversy erupted in Norway over the invitation of David Irving to speak at the 2009 [[Norwegian Festival of Literature]]. Several of Norway's most distinguished authors protested against the invitation. The leader of the board for the festival, Jesper Holte, defended the invitation by stating that "Our agenda is to invite a liar and a falsifier of history to a festival about truth. And confront him with this. Irving has been invited to discuss his concept of [[truth]] in light of his activity as a writer of historical books and the many accusations he has been exposed to as a consequence of this." Although Irving is introduced in the festival's webpages as "historian and writer" the board chair leader defended the more aggressive language being used to characterize Irving in connection with the controversy that had arisen. [[Lars Saabye Christensen]] and [[Roy Jacobsen]] were two authors who had threatened to boycott the festival on account of Irving's invitation and [[Anne B. Ragde]] stated that [[Sigrid Undset]] would have turned around in her grave. As the festival has as its subsidiary name "Sigrid Undset Days", a representative of Undset's family had requested that the name of the Nobel laureate be removed in connection with the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Geir |last=Rakvaag |title=Irving fortsatt invitert |url=http://www.dagsavisen.no/kultur/article372935.ece |work=[[Dagsavisen]] |location=Oslo |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=8 October 2008 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008174519/http://www.dagsavisen.no/kultur/article372935.ece |archivedate=8 October 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Vibecke |last= Wold Haagensen |title= Irving invitert som løgner |url= http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/hedmark_og_oppland/1.6252043 |publisher= [[NRK]] |location= [[Hedmark]]/[[Oppland]] |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=8 October 2008 |language= Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the Norwegian [[free speech]] organization [[Fritt Ord (organization)|Fritt Ord]] was critical towards letting Irving speak at the festival&lt;ref name="UPI"&gt;{{cite news |title= Holocaust denier unwelcome in Norway |url= http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/10/09/Holocaust_denier_unwelcome_in_Norway/UPI-56301223577740/ |agency = [[United Press International|UPI]] |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=10 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had requested that its logo be removed from the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Holocaust denial speaker's invitation cancelled |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2704141.ece |work=[[Aftenposten]] |location=Oslo, Norway |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=10 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010220014/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2704141.ece |archivedate=10 October 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition [[Edvard Hoem]] announced that he would not attend the 2009 festival with Irving taking part. [[Per Edgar Kokkvold]], leader of the [[Norwegian Press Confederation]] advocated cancelling Irving's invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Olav |last= Østrem |title= Sæterbakken slår tilbake |url= http://www.klassekampen.no/55114/article/item/null |work= [[Klassekampen]] |location= Oslo, Norway |date= 9 October 2008 |accessdate= 10 October 2008 |language= Norwegian |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081012070848/http://klassekampen.no/55114/article/item/null |archivedate= 12 October 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Days after the controversy had started, the invitation was rescinded. This led to the resignation of [[Stig Sæterbakken]] from his position as content director as he was the person who had invited Irving to the event. The head of the Norwegian Festival of Literature, Randi Skeie, deplored what had taken place, stating "Everything is fine as long as everyone agrees, but things get more difficult when one doesn't like the views being put forward."&lt;ref name="UPI"/&gt; Sæterbakken characterized his colleagues as "damned cowards" arguing that they were walking in lockstep.&lt;ref name="Olsen"&gt;{{cite news |first= Geir |last= Olsen |authorlink= Geir Olsen |title= Retrett mot Davig Irving.

According to editor-in-chief Sven Egil Omdal of ''[[Stavanger Aftenblad]]'' the opposition to Irving's participation at the festival appeared as a concerted effort and Omdal suggested [[campaign journalism]] from two of Norway's largest newspapers, ''[[Dagbladet]]'' and ''[[Aftenposten]]'' and Norway's public service broadcaster [[NRK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Sven Egil |last= Omdal |authorlink= Sven Egil Omdal |title= Ikke fullt så Fritt Ord |url= http://www.aftenbladet.no/debatt/medieblikk/927176/Ikke_fullt_saa_Fritt_Ord.html |work= [[Stavanger Aftenblad]] |location= [[Stavanger]], Norway |date= 11 October 2008 |accessdate= 15 October 2008 |language= Norwegian |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5ihrmyJqg?url=http://www.aftenbladet.no/debatt/medieblikk/927176/Ikke_fullt_saa_Fritt_Ord.html |archivedate= 1 August 2009 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Irving commented that he had not been told that the festival was going to present him as a liar,&lt;ref name="Olsen"/&gt; and that he was preparing a lecture about the real history of what took place in [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|Norway during World War II]], contrary to what official historians have presented. Irving stated that he had thought the Norwegian people to be made of tougher stuff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Ann |last= Christiansen |title= Irving: – Utsatt for global kampanje |url= http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article2703646.ece |work= [[Aftenposten]] |location= Oslo, Norway |date= 9 October 2008 |accessdate= 15 October 2008 |language= Norwegian |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081012211137/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article2703646.ece |archivedate= 12 October 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only days after the cancellation David Irving announced that he would go to Lillehammer during the literature festival and deliver his 2-hour lecture from a hotel room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Andreas |last= Wiese |title= David Irving rir igjen |url= http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2008/10/15/550314.html |work= [[Dagbladet]] |location= Oslo, Norway |date= 15 October 2008 |accessdate= 15 October 2008 |language= Norwegian |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081017085639/http://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/2008/10/15/550314.html |archivedate= 17 October 2008 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception by historians==
{{main|Critical responses to David Irving}}
Irving, once held in regard for his expert knowledge of German military archives, was a controversial figure from the start. His interpretations of the war were widely regarded as unduly favourable to the German side. At first this was seen as personal opinion, unpopular but consistent with full respectability as a historian.&lt;ref name="Lipstadt 2005 22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipstadt|2005|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1988, however, Irving had begun to reject the status of the Holocaust as a systematic and deliberate genocide. He soon became the main proponent of Holocaust denial. This, along with his association with far-right circles, dented his standing as a historian. A marked change in Irving's reputation can be seen in the surveys of the [[historiography of the Third Reich]] produced by [[Ian Kershaw]]. In the first edition of Kershaw's book ''The Nazi Dictatorship'' in 1985, Irving was called a "maverick" historian working outside the mainstream of the historical profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kershaw|1985|p=150}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the fourth edition of ''The Nazi Dictatorship'' in 2000, Irving was described only as a historical writer who had in the 1970s engaged in "provocations" intended to provide an "exculpation of Hitler's role in the Final Solution".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kershaw|1985|p=268}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critical responses to his work tend to follow this pattern.

The description of Irving as a historian, rather than a historical author, is controversial, with some publications since the libel trial continuing to refer to him as a "historian"&lt;ref name="DI_historian"&gt;e.g. [https://www.theguardian.com/irving/ The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; or "disgraced historian",&lt;ref name=DIdisgraced&gt;Philippe Naughton and agencies in Vienna. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2049360,00.html "Irving jailed for three years, despite Holocaust U-turn"], ''[[The Times]],'' 20 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; while others insist he is not a historian, and have adopted alternatives such as "author"&lt;ref name="DI_author"&gt;"In 1969 ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' determined 'It is incorrect to describe David Irving as a historian. In future we should describe him as an author.'" {{cite news |last= Ingrams |first= Richard |url= http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article347567.ece |title= Irving was the author of his own downfall |work= [[The Independent]] |date= 25 February 2006 |location= London |accessdate= 27 March 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071220125920/http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article347567.ece |archivedate= 20 December 2007 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The military historian [[John Keegan]] praised Irving for his "extraordinary ability to describe and analyse Hitler's conduct of military operations, which was his main occupation during the [[Second World War]]".&lt;ref name="keegan"&gt;John Keegan, {{cite web |url=http://portal.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F2000%2F04%2F12%2Fnirv512.html |title=The trial of David Irving—and my part in his downfall |accessdate=25 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040627233112/http://portal.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F2000%2F04%2F12%2Fnirv512.html |archivedate=27 June 2004 |df=dmy-all }}. ''The Daily Telegraph'' (UK). 12 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Donald Cameron Watt, [[Emeritus Professor]] of Modern History at the [[London School of Economics]], wrote that he admires some of Irving's work as a historian, though he rejects his conclusions about the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=HistoryNeeds&gt;{{cite news |title=History needs David Irvings|first=Donald |last=Cameron Watt |work= London Evening Standard |date= 11 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the libel proceedings against Irving, Watt declined Irving's request to testify, appearing only after a [[subpoena]] was ordered.&lt;ref name="Guttenplan 128"&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He testified that Irving had written a "very, very effective piece of historical scholarship" in the 1960s, which was unrelated to his controversial work. He also said that Irving was "not in the top class" of military historians.&lt;ref name="Guttenplan 128" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5973">"'''Dictatorships and Double Standards'''" is an essay by [[Jeane Kirkpatrick]], published&lt;ref&gt;Jeane Kirkpatrick, "[https://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/dictatorships-double-standards]," ''[[Commentary Magazine]]''. Volume 68, No. 5, November 1979, pp. 34–45. &amp; [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0671438360 Related book]&lt;/ref&gt; in the November 1979 issue of ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary Magazine]]'', which criticized the [[foreign policy]] of the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter administration]]. It is also the title of a 270-page book written by Kirkpatrick in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictatorships and Double Standards: Rationalism and Reason in Politics'', 1982 ({{ISBN|0-671-43836-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The article in ''Commentary Magazine'' in 1979 is credited with leading directly to Kirkpatrick's becoming an adviser to [[Ronald Reagan]] and thus her appointment as [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Weiner |title=Jeane Kirkpatrick, Reagan’s Forceful Envoy, Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/09/washington/09kirkpatrick.html?pagewanted=print |work=The New York Times |date=2006-12-09 |accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Timothy |last=Noah |authorlink=Timothy Noah |title=The Elusive Ronald Reagan |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/28/AR2007032801933_pf.html |work=The Washington Post |page=C04 |date=2007-03-29 |accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the views expressed in Kirkpatrick's essay influenced the foreign policy of the Reagan administration, particularly with regard to Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/blumenthal/2006/12/14/jeane_kirkpatrick/ |title=Mugged by reality |accessdate=2008-09-13 |last=Blumenthal |first=Sidney |authorlink=Sidney Blumenthal  |date=2006-12-14 |work=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirkpatrick argued that by demanding rapid liberalization in traditionally [[Autocracy|autocrat]]ic countries, the Carter administration (and previous administrations) had delivered those countries to [[anti-American]] opposition groups that proved more repressive than the governments they overthrew. She further accused the administration of a "double standard" in that it had never applied its rhetoric on the necessity of liberalization to the affairs of [[Communist state|Communist governments]].

The essay compares traditional autocracies and Communist regimes:

{{quote|[Traditional autocrats] do not disturb the habitual rhythms of work and leisure, habitual places of residence, habitual patterns of family and personal relations. Because the miseries of traditional life are familiar, they are bearable to ordinary people who, growing up in the society, learn to cope&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

[Revolutionary Communist regimes] claim jurisdiction over the whole life of the society and make demands for change that so violate internalized values and habits that inhabitants flee by the tens of thousands&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.}}

Kirkpatrick concluded that while the United States should encourage liberalization and democracy in autocratic countries, it should not do so when the government is facing violent overthrow, and should expect gradual change rather than immediate transformation.

==Criticism==
The [[AFL-CIO]]'s [[Tom Kahn]] criticized conceptual problems and strategic consequences in Kirkpatrick's analysis. In particular, Kahn suggested that policy should [[democracy promotion|promote democracy]] even in the countries dominated by [[Soviet communism]]. Kahn argued that the Polish labor-union Solidarity deserved U.S. support and even in its first years demonstrated that [[civil society]] could expand and that free [[labor unions]] could be organized, despite communist regimes. Kirkpatrick's analysis of communism underestimated the democratic potential of the working class.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation&lt;!-- allows "others=" unlike cite journal--&gt;|title=Beyond the double standard: A social&amp;nbsp;democratic view of the authoritarianism&amp;nbsp;versus&amp;nbsp;totalitarianism debate|first=Tom|last=Kahn|authorlink=Tom Kahn|journal=New America|publisher=[[Social Democrats,&amp;nbsp;USA]]|date=July 1985 |url=http://www.dissentmagazine.org/wp-content/files_mf/1389820828d12Kahn.pdf|format=pdf|others=January 1985 speech to the ‘Democratic Solidarity Conference’ organized by the Young Social&amp;nbsp;Democrats (YSD) under the auspices of the Foundation for Democratic Education|ref=harv}}

Ted Galen Carpenter of the [[Cato Institute]] noted that while Communist movements tend to depose rival authoritarians, the traditional authoritarian regimes supported by the US came to power by overthrowing democracies. He thus concludes that while Communist regimes are more difficult to eradicate, traditional autocratic regimes "pose the more lethal threat to functioning democracies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa058.html "The United States and Third World Dictatorships: A Case for Benign Detachment"] Ted Galen Carpenter.

'''Evictionism''' is a [[Morality|moral theory]] advanced by [[Walter Block]] and Roy Whitehead on a proposed [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] view of [[abortion]] based on [[property rights]]. This theory is built upon the earlier work of philosopher [[Murray Rothbard]]&lt;ref&gt;"Literature of liberty," [[Cato Institute]], v. 4, p. 12, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote that "no being has a right to live, unbidden, as a parasite within or upon some person's body" and that therefore the woman is entitled to eject the baby from her body at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=For a New Liberty|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B65ic_7bfFEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=For+a+New+Liberty&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_4ZpTOCuLoH58Abl8OyyBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=abortion&amp;f=false 131–132]|chapter=Personal Liberty|author=Rothbard, Murray|isbn=0-930073-02-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evictionists view a mother's womb as her property and an unwanted fetus as a "trespasser or parasite", even while lacking the will to act. They argue that a mother has the right to evict a fetus from her body since she has no obligation to care for a trespasser. The authors' hope is that bystanders will "[[Homestead principle|homestead]]" the right to care for evicted babies and reduce the number of human deaths. They argue that life begins at conception and state that the act of abortion must be conceptually separated into the acts of:
# the eviction of the [[fetus]] from the womb, and
# the [[Homicide|killing]] of the baby.
Building on the libertarian stand against [[trespass]] and [[murder]], Block supports a right to the first act (eviction), but not the second act (murder).

Walter Block believes the woman always has a right to evict but may only legally abort if the fetus is not [[Fetal viability|viable]] outside the womb, or
# the woman has publicly announced her abandonment of the right to [[Child custody|custody]] of the fetus, and
# no one else has "[[Homestead principle|homesteaded]]" that right by offering to care for the resulting baby.&lt;ref name="Block"&gt;*Walter Block, Roy Whitehead, [http://www.walterblock.com/wp-content/uploads/publications/block-whitehead_abortion-2005.pdf ''Compromising the Uncompromisable: A Private Property Approach to Resolving the Abortion Controversy''], [http://www.walterblock.com Walter Block personal web site.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jakub Bozydar Wisniewski, [http://libertarianpapers.org/articles/2010/lp-2-16.pdf "A Critique of Block on Abortion and Child Abandonment"], LibertariansPapers.org, project of [[Ludwig Von Mises Institute]], VOL. 2, ART. NO. 16 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embryonic research==
Likewise, Block proposes that medical experimenters can treat the embryos they have in their possession as laboratory "[[Animal testing|animals]]", as is their desire, contingent on only one stipulation: that no one else wishes to [[Parenting|raise]] these very young infants on their own. If there are adoptive parents who wish to homestead the right to care for the children, their rights trump those of the creators of the fertilized egg since the former wishes to protect the child from harm, while the latter does not. Thus Block offers an alternative to the standard choice between the [[pro-life]] and [[pro-choice]] positions on [[stem cell]] research.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Walter. 2010. [http://jmp.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/jhq033?ijkey=oczT7ytzmoAD1cz&amp;amp;keytype=ref  ''A Libertarian Perspective on the Stem Cell Debate: Compromising the Uncompromisible,''] ''Journal of Medicine and Philosophy''.&amp;nbsp; Vol. 35: 429-448&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advances in technology==
Evictionists believe that advances in technology will continue to improve the medical ability to preserve a living fetus after removal from its mother. This future technology is hoped to save the lives of evicted fetuses at increasingly younger ages whereas aborted fetuses would continue to die at any age.&lt;ref name=Block /&gt;

During the past several decades, neonatal care has improved with advances in medical science, and therefore the [[Fetal viability#Limit of viability|limit of viability]] has moved earlier.&lt;ref&gt;''Roe v. Wade'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=410&amp;page=113 410 U.S. 113] (1973) ("viability is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.") Retrieved 2007-03-04.&lt;/ref&gt; The lower limit of viability is approximately five months [[gestational age]], and usually later.&lt;ref&gt;Halamek, Louis. "[http://neoreviews.aappublications.org/cgi/content/extract/4/6/e153 Prenatal Consultation at the Limits of Viability]", ''NeoReviews'', Vol.4 No.6 (2003): "most neonatologists would agree that survival of infants younger than approximately 22 to 23 weeks’ estimated gestational age [i.e. 20 to 21 weeks' estimated fertilization age] is universally dismal and that resuscitative efforts should not be undertaken when a neonate is born at this point in pregnancy."&lt;/ref&gt;

Further phenomena were reported by a number of independent contemporary sources:

==Scientific evidence==
[[Growth ring|Tree ring]] analysis by [[dendrochronology|dendrochronologist]] [[Mike Baillie]], of the [[Queen's University of Belfast]], shows abnormally little growth in Irish [[oak]] in 536 and another sharp drop in 542, after a partial recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Baillie, M.G.L. (1994). "Dendrochronology Raises Questions About the Nature of the AD 536 Dust-Veil Event." ''[[The Holocene (journal)|The Holocene]]'' fig. 3 p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar patterns are recorded in tree rings from [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]], in [[California]]'s [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and in rings from [[Chile]]an ''[[Fitzroya]]'' trees.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} [[Ice core]]s from [[Greenland]] and [[Antarctica]] show evidence of substantial [[sulfate]] deposits in around 534 ± 2, which is evidence of an extensive acidic dust veil.&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt;

==Possible explanations==
It has been conjectured that the changes were due to ashes or dust thrown into the air after the eruption of a [[volcano]] (a phenomenon known as "[[volcanic winter]]"),&lt;ref name="Wohletz"&gt;Wohletz, Ken, ''[http://www.ees1.lanl.gov/Wohletz/Krakatau.htm Were the Dark Ages Triggered by Volcano-Related Climate Changes in the 6th Century?]''&lt;/ref&gt; or after the impact of a [[comet]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=MacIntyre, Ferren|title=Simultaneous Settlement of Indo-Pacific Extrema?|journal=Rapa Nui Journal|volume=16|issue=2|pages=96–104|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[meteorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Baillie, M. G. L.|title=Exodus to Arthur: Catastrophic Encounters with Comets|publisher=B.T. Batsford|location=London|year=1999|isbn=0-7134-8352-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rigby |first1=Emma|first2=Melissa|last2=Symonds|first3=Derek|last3=Ward-Thompson|title=A comet impact in AD536? |journal=Astronomy and Geophysics|volume=45|date=February 2004|issue=1|doi=10.1046/j.1468-4004.2003.45123.x|pages=1.23|bibcode = 2004A&amp;G....45a..23R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence of sulfate deposits in ice cores strongly supports the volcano hypothesis; the sulfate spike is even more intense than what accompanied the lesser episode of climatic aberration in 1816, popularly known as the "[[Year Without a Summer]]", which has been connected to the explosion of the volcano [[Mount Tambora]] in [[Sumbawa]].&lt;ref name="Larsen" /&gt;

In 1984, [[R. B. Stothers]] postulated that the event might have been caused by the volcano [[Rabaul caldera|Rabaul]] in what is now [[New Britain]], near [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stothers R.B.|title=Mystery cloud of AD 536|journal=Nature|volume=307|issue=5949|pages=344–5|date=26 January 1984|doi=10.1038/307344a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v307/n5949/abs/307344a0.html|bibcode = 1984Natur.307..344S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[David Keys (author)|David Keys]] in his book ''Catastrophe: A Quest for the Origins of the Modern World'' (supported by work of the American [[volcanology|volcanologist]] Ken Wohletz), suggested that the volcano [[Krakatoa]] exploded at the time and caused the changes.&lt;ref name="Wohletz"/&gt; It is suggested that an eruption of Krakatoa described as occurring in 416 by the Javanese ''[[Pararaton|Book of Kings]]'' actually took place in 535&amp;ndash;536, there being no other evidence of such an eruption in 416.&lt;ref&gt;Keys (2000), page 385&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[Dallas Abbott]] of [[Columbia University]]'s [[Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory]] in New York published evidence from Greenland [[ice core]]s that multiple [[comet impact]]s caused the haze. The [[spherules]] found in the ice may originate from terrestrial debris ejected into the atmosphere by an impact event.&lt;ref name=Abbott08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comet smashes triggered ancient famine|journal=New Scientist|date=7 January 2009|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126882.900-comet-smashes-triggered-ancient-famine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Robert Dull]], [[John Southon]], and colleagues presented evidence suggesting a link between the [[Tierra Blanca Joven]] (TBJ) eruption of the [[Lake Ilopango|Ilopango caldera]] in central [[El Salvador]] and the 536 event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Dull, R., J.R.

A conservative bulk [[tephra]] volume for the TBJ event of ~84&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; was calculated, indicating a large [[Volcanic explosivity index]] 6+ event and a magnitude of 6.9. The results suggest that the Ilopango TBJ eruption size, latitude, and age are consistent with the ice core sulphate records of Larsen et al. 2008.

A 2015 study further supported the theory of a major eruption in "535 or early 536", with North American volcanoes considered a likely candidate. It also identified signals of a second eruption in 539–540, likely to have been in the tropics, which would have sustained the cooling effects of the first eruption through to around 550.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Timing and climate forcing of volcanic eruptions for the past 2,500 years|url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature14565|journal = Nature|pages = 543–549|volume = 523|issue = 7562|doi = 10.1038/nature14565|first = M.|last = Sigl|first2 = M.|last2 = Winstrup|first3 = J.

In 2018, Harvard University researchers suggested the cause was a volcanic eruption in [[Iceland]] that erupted in early 536, however the author of the previous study said to [[Science (journal)|''Science'' magazine]] that the evidence is insufficient to discard the North America hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/11/why-536-was-worst-year-be-alive|title=Why 536 was ‘the worst year to be alive’|date=2018-11-15|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en|df=mdy-all|author=Gibbons, Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic consequences==
{{main|Late Antique Little Ice Age}}
The 536 event and ensuing famine have been suggested as an explanation for the deposition of [[hoard]]s of gold by Scandinavian elites at the end of the [[Migration Period]]. The gold may have been deposited as a sacrifice to appease the gods and get the sunlight back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Morten Axboe|author-link=Morten Axboe|title=Året 536|journal=Skalk|volume=|issue=4|pages=28–32|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Morten Axboe|author-link=Morten Axboe|title=The year 536 and the Scandinavian gold hoards|journal=[[Medieval Archaeology (journal)|Medieval Archaeology]]|volume=43|pages=186–8|year=1999|url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-769-1/ahds/dissemination/pdf/vol43/43_186_188.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline of [[Teotihuacán#Collapse|Teotihuacán]], a huge city in [[Mesoamerica]], is also associated with the droughts related to the [[climate change]]s, with signs of civil unrest and famines.

A book written by David Keys speculates that the climate changes may have contributed to various developments, such as the emergence of the [[Plague of Justinian]], the decline of the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], the migration of [[Mongolia]]n tribes towards the West, the end of the [[Sassanid Empire]], the collapse of the [[Gupta Empire]], the rise of [[Islam]], the expansion of [[Turkic expansion|Turkic]] tribes, and the fall of Teotihuacán.&lt;ref name="Keys, David Patrick 2000"/&gt; In 2000, a [[3BM Television]] production (for [[WNET]] and [[Channel 4|Channel Four]]) capitalized upon Keys' book. The documentary, under the name ''Catastrophe! How the World Changed'', was broadcast in the US as part of [[PBS]]'s ''[[Secrets of the Dead]]'' series. However, Keys and Wohletz' ideas are not widely accepted now. Reviewing Keys' book, the British archaeologist [[Ken Dark]] commented that "much of the apparent evidence presented in the book is highly debatable, based on poor sources or simply incorrect. [...] Nonetheless, both the global scope and the emphasis on the 6th century AD as a time of wide-ranging change are notable, and the book contains some obscure information which will be new to many. However, it fails to demonstrate its central thesis and does not offer a convincing explanation for the many changes discussed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Ken|last=Dark |author-link=Ken Dark |title=Review of David Keys' ''Catastroph'' |journal=British Archaeology |issue=49|date=November 1999|url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba49/ba49book.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gunn, Joel D.|title=The Years Without Summer: Tracing A.D. 536 and its Aftermath|series=British Archaeological Reports (BAR) International|publisher=Archaeopress|location=Oxford, England|year=2000|isbn=1-84171-074-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{lang|la|Famuli vestrae pietatis}}''''', also known by the Latin mnemonic '''''{{lang|la|duo sunt}}''''' ("there are two"), is a letter written in 494 by [[Pope Gelasius I]] to [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Anastasius I Dicorus]] which expressed the Gelasian doctrine.{{sfnm|1a1=Bjork|1y=2010|2a1=Denzinger|2y=2012|2loc=n. 347}} According to commentary in the ''[[Enchiridion symbolorum]]'', the letter is "the most celebrated document of the [[ancient Church]] concerning the two powers on earth."{{sfn|Denzinger|2012|p=121}} The Gelasian doctrine articulates a Christian theology about division of authority and power. All Medieval theories about division of power between priestly spiritual authority and secular temporal authority were versions of the Gelasian doctrine.{{sfn|Strawn|2015}} According to the Gelasian doctrine, secular temporal authority is inferior to priestly spiritual authority since a priestly spiritual authority is responsible for the eternal condition of both a secular temporal authority and the subjects of that secular temporal authority but "implies that the priestly authority is inferior to the secular authority in the secular domain."{{sfn|Strawn|2015}}

==Biblical foundation==
[[Paul of Tarsus]] taught that [[Jesus]] was the successor of [[Melchizedek]].{{refn|{{bibleref2|Hebrews|5:6|NRSVCE}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|5:10|NRSVCE}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|6:20|NRSVCE}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|7:1|NRSVCE}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|7:10-11|NRSVCE}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|7:15|NRSVCE}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|7:17|NRSVCE}}, {{bibleref2-nb|Hebrews|7:21|NRSVCE}}, cited in {{harvtxt|Strawn|2015}}.}}
	
Jesus taught [[Render unto Caesar|submission to the power of two independent authorities]],{{refn|{{bibleref2|Matthew|22:21|NRSVCE}}, cited in {{harvtxt|Strawn|2015}}.}} Paul explained that everyone is subject to the God instituted authority of government which includes taxation.{{refn|{{bibleref2|Romans|13:1-7|NRSVCE}}, cited in {{harvtxt|Strawn|2015}}.}}

==Dualistic principle of Church and State==
This letter established the dualistic principle that would underlie all Western European political thought for almost a [[millennium]]. Gelasius expressed a distinction between two principles governing the world, which Gelasius called the "sacred authority of bishops" (''{{lang|la|auctoritas sacrata pontificum}}'') and the "royal power" (''{{lang|la|regalis potestas}}'').{{sfn|Denzinger|2012|loc=n. 347}}

==''Potestas'' and ''auctoritas''==
These two principles, ''{{lang|la|[[auctoritas]]}}'' lending justification to ''{{lang|la|[[potestas]]}}'', and ''{{lang|la|potestas}}'' providing the executive strength for ''{{lang|la|auctoritas}}'' were, Gelasius said, to be considered independent in their own spheres of operation, yet expected to work together in harmony.

==Sovereign immunity==
{{citation needed span|text=The letter played a significant role in the development of the legal doctrine of [[sovereign immunity]], in that it gave political protections to the papacy and the monarchy,who promised not to violate each other's respective jurisdictions.|date=February 2016}} This doctrine remains in force in international politics, even though most absolute monarchies have been replaced by constitutional monarchies or republics.

[[File:Poem by Martin Niemoeller at the the Holocaust memorial in Boston MA.jpg|350px|thumb|Engraving of the poem presented at the [[New England Holocaust Memorial]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]]]

"'''First they came ...'''" is a poem written by the German [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] pastor [[Martin Niemöller]] (1892–1984). It is about the [[cowardice]] of German intellectuals following the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]]s' rise to power and subsequent [[Purge|purging]] of their chosen targets, group after group. Many variations and adaptations in the spirit of the original have been published in the English language. It deals with themes of [[persecution]], [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[Personal responsibility|responsibility]].

==The text==
The best-known versions of the speech are the poems that began circulating by the 1950s.&lt;ref name=quotation&gt;{{cite web|last=Marcuse|first=Harold|title=Martin Niemöller's famous quotation: "First they came for the Communists ... "|url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/niem.htm|website=University of California at Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] quotes the following text as one of the many poetic versions of the speech:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |article=Martin Niemöller: "First they came for the Socialists..." |title=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |url=https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/martin-niemoeller-first-they-came-for-the-socialists |access-date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |article=Martin Niemöller: "First they came for the Socialists..." |title=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007392 |access-date=25 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180723135844/https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007392 |archive-date=23 July 2018 |dead-url=no}} This is a different and older article which contains more complete photographs than the new version.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote |
First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—&lt;br&gt;
{{in5}}Because I was not a socialist.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—&lt;br&gt;
{{in5}}Because I was not a trade unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—&lt;br&gt;
{{in5}}Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.}}

Niemöller created multiple versions of the text during his career, but evidence identified by professor [[Harold Marcuse]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara|University of California Santa Barbara]] indicates that the Holocaust Memorial Museum version is inaccurate because Niemöller frequently used the word "[[Communism|communists]]" and not "[[Socialism|socialists]]."&lt;ref name=quotation /&gt; The substitution of "socialists" for "communists" is an effect of [[anti-communism]], and most ubiquitous in the version that has proliferated in the United States. According to Marcuse, "Niemöller's original argument was premised on naming groups he and his audience would instinctively not care about. The omission of Communists in Washington, and of Jews in Germany, distorts that meaning and should be corrected."&lt;ref name=quotation/&gt;

Niemöller's earliest speeches, written in 1946, list the Communists, incurable patients, [[Jews]] or [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and civilians in countries [[German-occupied Europe|occupied]] by [[Nazi Germany]]. In all versions, the impact is carefully built up, by going from the "smallest, most distant" group to the largest, Jewish, group, and then finally to himself as a by then outspoken critic of [[Nazism]]. Niemöller made the cardinal "who cares about them" clear in his speech for the [[Confessing Church]] in [[Frankfurt]] on 6 January 1946, of which this is a partial translation:&lt;ref name=quotation/&gt;

{{bquote |
When Pastor Niemöller was put in a concentration camp we wrote the year 1937; when the concentration camp was opened we wrote the year 1933, and the people who were put in the camps then were '''Communists'''. Who cared about them? We knew it, it was printed in the newspapers.

Who raised their voice, maybe the Confessing Church? We thought: Communists, those opponents of religion, those enemies of Christians - "should I be my brother's keeper?"

Then they got rid of the '''sick, the so-called incurables'''. - I remember a conversation I had with a person who claimed to be a Christian. He said: Perhaps it's right, these incurably sick people just cost the state money, they are just a burden to themselves and to others. Isn't it best for all concerned if they are taken out of the middle [of society]? -- Only then did the church as such take note. Then we started talking, until our voices were again silenced in public. Can we say, we aren't guilty/responsible?

I believe, we Confessing-Church-Christians have every reason to say: mea culpa, mea culpa! We can talk ourselves out of it with the excuse that it would have cost me my head if I had spoken out.}}

This speech was translated and published in English in 1947, but was later retracted when it was alleged that Niemöller was an early supporter of the Nazis.&lt;ref name="speech"&gt;{{cite web|author=Marcuse, Harold|url= http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/projects/niem/Niem1946GuiltHope13-16.htm |title=Of Guilt and Hope|author2= Niemöller, Martin |website=University of California at Santa Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "sick, the so-called incurables" were killed in the euthanasia programme "[[Aktion T4]]". A 1955 version of the speech, mentioned in an interview of a German professor quoting Niemöller, lists Communists, socialists, schools, Jews, the press, and the Church. An American version delivered by a congressman in 1968 includes industrialists, who were not persecuted by the Nazis, and omits Communists.

In 1976, Niemöller gave the following answer in response to an interview question asking about the origins of the poem.&lt;ref name=quotation/&gt; The ''Martin-Niemöller-Stiftung'' ("Martin Niemöller Foundation") considers this the "classical" version of the speech:

{{bquote|
There were no minutes or copy of what I said, and it may be that I formulated it differently. But the idea was anyhow: The '''Communists''', we still let that happen calmly; and the '''trade unions''', we also let that happen; and we even let the '''Social Democrats''' happen. All of that was not our affair. The Church did not concern itself with politics at all at that time, and it shouldn't have anything do with them either. In the Confessing Church we didn't want to represent any political resistance ''per se'', but we wanted to determine for the Church that that was not right, and that it should not become right in the Church, that's why already in '33, when we created the pastors' emergency federation ([[Pfarrernotbund]]), we put as the 4th point in the founding charter: If an offensive is made against ministers and they are simply ousted as ministers, because they are of '''Jewish lineage''' (Judenstämmlinge) or something like that, then we can only say as a Church: No. And that was then the 4th point in the obligation, and that was probably the first contra-anti-Semitic pronouncement coming from the Protestant Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://martin-niemoeller-stiftung.de/martin-niemoeller/was-sagte-niemoeller-wirklich |title=Was sagte Niemöller wirklich?|author=Niemöller, Martin|website=Martin Niemöller Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Author==
{{main|Martin Niemöller}}

Martin Niemöller was a German Lutheran pastor and theologian born in [[Lippstadt]], Germany, in 1892. Niemöller was an [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] and supported [[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power at first. But when Hitler insisted on the supremacy of the state over religion, Niemöller became disillusioned. He became the leader of a group of German clergymen opposed to Hitler. In 1937 he was arrested and eventually confined in [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]] and [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]. He was released in 1945 by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. He continued his career in Germany as a clergyman and as a leading voice of penance and reconciliation for the German people after [[World War II]]. His statement, sometimes presented as a poem, is well-known, frequently quoted, and is a popular model for describing the dangers of [[political apathy]].

==Origin==
The statement was published in a book by [[Milton Mayer]], ''They Thought They Were Free'' (1955), based on interviews he had conducted in Germany several years earlier.  The quotation was circulated by civil rights activists and educators in the United States in the late 1950s.  Some research traces the text to several speeches given by Niemöller in 1946.&lt;ref name=quotation/&gt;

[[File:US Navy 090427-N-0995C-012 Lt. Dennis Kelly reads an excerpt of Reverend Martin Niemoller's poem, First they came..jpg|thumb|Lt. Dennis Kelly reads an excerpt of Niemöller's poem during a Holocaust Days of Remembrance Observance service in [[Pearl Harbor]]; 27 April 2009]]
 
Nonetheless, the wording remains controversial, both in terms of its provenance, and the substance and order of the groups that are mentioned in its many versions. While Niemöller's published 1946 speeches mention Communists, the incurably ill, Jews or [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (depending on which speech), and people in occupied countries, the 1955 text, a paraphrase by a German professor in an interview, lists communists, socialists, "the schools, the press, the Jews, and so on", and ends with "the Church".  Based on the explanation given by Niemöller himself in 1976, this refers to the German Protestant ('Evangelische') Church, and not to the German Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=quotation/&gt;

However, as claimed by [[Richard John Neuhaus]] in the November 2001 issue of ''[[First Things]]'', when "asked in 1971 about the correct version of the quote, Niemöller said he was not quite sure when he had said the famous words but, if people insist upon citing them, he preferred a version that listed 'the Communists', 'the trade unionists', 'the Jews', and 'me'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Neuhaus, Richard John Neuhaus|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2001/11/september-before-and-after|title=September 11-Before and After|publisher=First Things|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historian [[Harold Marcuse]] could not verify that interview.&lt;ref name=quotation/&gt;  Rather, he found a 1976 interview in which Niemöller referred to a 1974 discussion with the general bishop of the [[Lutheran Church of Slovakia]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Usages==

At the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in Washington, D.C., the quotation is on display in a variation that substitutes "Socialists" for "Communists".  The Holocaust Museum website has a discussion of the history of the quotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007392|author=Niemöller, Martin |title=First they came for the Socialists…|website=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of the poem is on display at the Holocaust memorial [[Yad Vashem]] in [[Jerusalem]]. The poem is also presented at the [[Virginia Holocaust Museum]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], the [[New England Holocaust Memorial]] in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], the [[Florida Holocaust Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], and the Illinois Holocaust Memorial in [[Skokie, Illinois]].

The '''flag of South Africa from 1928 to 1994''' was used by the [[Union of South Africa]] and its successor state, the [[South Africa|Republic of South Africa]] until 1994. It was also used in [[South-West Africa]] (now [[Namibia]]) when the territory was under South African rule. Based on the Dutch [[Prince's Flag]], it contained the [[flag of the United Kingdom]], the [[flag of the Orange Free State]] and the [[flag of the South African Republic]] in the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/06/economist-explains-17 |title=How an old Dutch flag became a racist symbol |work=The Economist |date=22 June 2015 |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nickname for the flag was ''Oranje, Blanje, Blou'' ([[Afrikaans]] for: "orange, white, blue").&lt;ref name=stat /&gt;

It was adopted in 1928 by an act of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] from the first [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]] majority government. In [[1948]], after their election victory, the [[National_Party_(South_Africa)|National Party]] unsuccessfully tried to amend the flag design to remove what they called the “Blood Stain" (the flag of the United Kingdom).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Dickens |url=https://samilhistory.com/2017/03/15/the-inconvenient-and-unknown-history-of-south-africas-national-flags/ |title=The inconvenient and unknown history of South Africa’s national flags |work=The Observation Post |date=15 March 2017 |accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 Prime Minister [[John Vorster]] proposed the adoption of a new flag in 1971 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the declaration of South Africa as an independent republic. Vorster's idea did not gain Parliamentary support and the flag change never happened. As such this flag was used during the entirety of the [[apartheid]] era as well, leading to it being labeled the "Apartheid flag".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Dickens |url=https://samilhistory.com/2017/03/15/the-inconvenient-and-unknown-history-of-south-africas-national-flags/ |title=The inconvenient and unknown history of South Africa’s national flags |work=The Observation Post |date=15 March 2017 |accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|quote=

Following its retirement in 1994 the flag has been controversial within South Africa, with some people viewing it as historic and a symbol of Afrikaner heritage while others view it as a symbol of apartheid and of [[Baasskap|white supremacy]].

}} 
Before 31 May 1928 the only flag that had official status in the [[Union of South Africa]] was the United Kingdom's [[Union Jack]] as South Africa was part of the [[British Empire]]. The [[South Africa Red Ensign]] was used as an unofficial flag. In 1925, discussion rose about creating a new flag for South Africa as many descendants of [[Boers]] found the Union Jack unacceptable after the [[Boer War]].&lt;ref name=crw /&gt; In 1926 the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]] granted South Africa legislative autonomy, opening the possibility of a new flag. British settlers wanted the Union Jack in the new flag as part of the [[British Empire]] while the [[Afrikaner]]s did not. A compromise was reached whereby the new flag would consist of the Prince's Flag as this was the first flag raised on South Africa and a badge of the Union Jack in the centre with the flags of the [[Orange Free State]] and the [[South African Republic]].&lt;ref name=crw /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?56323-1/south-african-election-special-2|title=South African Election Special, 2|website=C-SPAN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union Jack was mirrored in the new flag with [[Union Jack#Flying|the hoist on the right]] so that it did not take precedence over the others.&lt;ref name=crw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/za_old.html |title=South Africa (1928–1994) |publisher=[[Flags of the World]] |date= |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was denounced by [[Daniel François Malan|D. F. Malan]], then the South African [[Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(South_Africa)|Minister of Home Affairs]], who described the group of miniature flags "a scab... which will one day fall off".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6ihVD5RkUIQC&amp;dq=%22Malan%22+%22scab%22+%22flag%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=+%22scab%22+ ''South African Tragedy: The Life and Times of Jan Hofmeyr''], [[Alan Paton]], [[Charles Scribner's Sons]], 1966, page 102&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1927, the Afrikaner majority [[Parliament of South Africa]] passed the Union Nationality &amp; Flag Act, which stated that the Union Jack and the new Flag of the Union of South Africa were to have equal status as the flag of South Africa. The act came into force in 1928 when both flags were raised over the [[Houses of Parliament, Cape Town]] and the [[Union Buildings]] in Pretoria &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/index.php/site/q/03lv01538/04lv01646/05lv01769.htm |title=1927. Union Nationality &amp; Flag Act |publisher=The O'Malley Archives |date= |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dual status was ended in 1957 with the passing of the Flags Amendment Act which declared that the union flag would be the sole flag of South Africa with the act also declaring that "[[Die Stem van Suid-Afrika]]" would be the country's sole anthem and dropping "[[God Save the Queen]]".&lt;ref name=crw /&gt;

When South Africa became a republic in 1961, the flag remained the same. The Afrikaner voting majority disliked the flag retaining the Union Jack in the centre. Repeated calls were made for it to be removed or for a new flag but no action was taken by the ruling [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] until 1968. [[B.&amp;nbsp;J. Vorster]] convened a commission in that year to create a new flag in time for the 10th anniversary of South Africa's declaration of independence in 1971, but no changes were eventually made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4eg9AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oUgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2838,2158422&amp;dq=south+africa+change+flag+1971&amp;hl=en|title=Lord Graham quits Smith Cabinet as right-wing anger grows|p=1, 18|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Glasgow Herald]]|date=12 September 1968|volume=186|edition=197|accessdate=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag was treated with respect by Afrikaners with daily [[flag salute]]s in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2013-12-10-my-old-south-african-flag/#.Vtc9vczcvIU|first=Ivo|last=Vegter |title=My old South African Flag |publisher=Daily Maverick |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used as part of celebrations of the inauguration of the [[State President of South Africa|State President]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-21/news/mn-934_1_south-africa-s-flag |title=De Klerk Sworn In, Pledges S.

The flag even had an [[Flag anthem|ode dedicated to it]], "[[:af:Ons eie vlag|Vlaglied]]" ({{Lang-en|"Flag Song"}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34C81-sbDAY|title=Flag anthem of South Africa(1961-1994): "Vlaglied"|access-date=1 November 2018|first=|last=TheKhanate|date=13 June 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vlaglied"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/za-song.html|title=South Africa - flag songs|website=www.crwflags.com|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/Act%209%20of%201974.pdf|title='Vlaglied' Copyright Act, 1974|location=South Africa|access-date=2 November 2018|date=1974|publisher=Republic of South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Cornelis Jacobus Langenhoven]]&lt;ref name="vlaglied"/&gt; and composed by [[:af:F.J.

Due to variances in manufacturing, many flags were manufactured with their blue a dark shade akin to that found on the flag of the UK as many early flags were made in the UK. Because of this discrepancy, in 1982, the South African government specified that "Solway blue", a lighter shade of blue, be used on the flags as was originally intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180608104227/http://www.savaflags.org.za/spec/South+Africa+-+National+1928-1994+sheet+2.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=8 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180608104803/http://www.savaflags.org.za/spec/South+Africa+-+National+1928-1994+-+sheet+1.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=8 June 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The flag was featured on the cantons of the flags of government agencies such the military, prisons service, and police.&lt;ref name="crwflags.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/za-polic.html|title=South African Police Service|website=www.crwflags.com|access-date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the flag was retired in 1994, the new South African flag replaced it on those flags' cantons.&lt;ref name="crwflags.com"/&gt;

== Opposition ==
Despite the flag's origins and adoption pre-dating the National Party's ascension to power by twenty years, the flag gradually became associated with the [[apartheid]] regime. Movements like the [[Black Sash]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/south_africa/society/south_africa_society_women_and_apartheid.html |title=South Africa Women and Apartheid |publisher=Photius.com |date= |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]]&lt;ref name=prot /&gt; started protesting against it with their own symbols. Often the flag of South Africa would be removed from public display and replaced with the banned [[ANC flag]].&lt;ref name=prot&gt;{{cite book | first =Gail | last =Gerhart  | title =From Protest to Challenge: A Documentary History of African Politics in South Africa, 1882-1990.| publisher = Indiana University Press | edition =   | year = 2010 | isbn = 0253354226 | page = 516}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag would also be the subject of public burnings during [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid]] protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Craig |last=Jungwirth|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V105/N15/rally.15n.html|title=Police arrest nine in protest march |publisher=The Tech|date=5 April 1985 |accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/african-national-congress-supporters-set-a-south-african-news-photo/167948014#african-national-congress-supporters-set-a-south-african-flag-on-fire-picture-id167948014|title=African National Congress (ANC) supporters set a South African flag on fire 14 April 1993 during a commemoration service for South African Communist Party (SACP) chief Chris Hani|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1989, [[F.&amp;nbsp;W. de Klerk]] became state president and immediately unbanned the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) and released their leader [[Nelson Mandela]] from prison. De Klerk instigated [[negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa]] with Mandela's ANC. One of the ANC's demands was that the flag gradually decrease in usage in South African life and that a new flag be created, as black South Africans associated the current one with apartheid and [[Afrikaner nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Sakhela | last =Buhlungu  | title =State of the Nation: South Africa 2007| publisher = A&amp;C Black | edition =   | year = 1997 | isbn = 0718500725 | page = 414}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The negotiations led to the [[South African apartheid referendum, 1992]] where voters approved the ending of apartheid. The referendum decision resulted in the [[World Rugby|International Rugby Board]] allowing the [[South Africa national rugby union team]] to play test matches again. The ANC agreed to endorse the team on the provision that the flag not be used. During the [[1992 South Africa vs New Zealand rugby union match|return test]], the [[Conservative Party (South Africa)|Conservative Party]] handed out numerous flags to the majority white crowd as a symbol of defiance against the ANC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =David Ross | last =Black  | title =Rugby and the South African Nation| publisher = Manchester University Press | edition =   | year = 1998 | isbn = 0719049326 |page=115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], the [[South Africa at the 1992 Summer Olympics|South African team]] performed under a specially designed flag for the [[South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee|National Olympic Committee of South Africa]], although white South African spectators at the games waved the then national flag, despite attempts by officials to stop them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=James |last=Larson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U_u73VtZcJIC&amp;lpg=PA228&amp;ots=9sYdihq3Ss&amp;dq=south%20africa%20olympics%201992%20flag&amp;pg=PA228#v=onepage&amp;q=south%20africa%20olympics%201992%20flag&amp;f=true |title=''Television in the Olympics'' |isbn=0861965388 |year=1995 |page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Flag of South Africa.svg|thumb|The post-1994 flag of South Africa]]
In 1994 the State Herald of South Africa, [[Fred Brownell]], was approached to design a new national flag for South Africa to replace the flag in time for the first elections after apartheid. He designed the new flag of South Africa with a combination of the old flag and the colours of the ANC flag. &lt;ref name=brown /&gt; The new flag design was approved personally by both de Klerk and Mandela before being unanimously approved by the [[Transitional Executive Council (South Africa)|Transitional Executive Council]] on 15 March 1994. De Klerk made the public proclamation of the replacement of the old flag on 20 April, seven days before the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 South African general election]] on 27 April 1994.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27155475 |title=Fred Brownell: The man who made South Africa's flag |publisher=BBC News |date=27 April 2014 |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the flag was lowered for the last time at the parliament building in Cape Town, onlookers approvingly shouted "Down, down!" as it was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4226057.html|title=Unity Flag Shows Its Colors|date=27 April 1994|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sed-dqbZgkc|title=Raising of the New South African Flag|first=|last=Antonio Coppola|date=24 May 2018|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== After 1994 ==
Following its official retirement as the flag of South Africa, the flag was adopted by some white South Africans as being a symbol of Afrikaner heritage and history.&lt;ref name=stat&gt;{{cite web|last=Merten |first=Marianne |url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2015-04-13-post-statue-sa-what-will-be-left-when-the-toppling-is-done/#.Vtgxv8zcvIU |title=Post-Statue SA: What will be left when the toppling is done? |work=Daily Maverick |date=13 April 2015 |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many South Africans still view it as a symbol of apartheid, and therefore have strongly discouraged its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Christi | last =Van der Westhuizen |title =White Power &amp; the Rise and Fall of the National Party| publisher = Zebra Press | edition =   | year = 2007 | isbn = 1770073051 |page=326 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the negative associations, it was never banned by the [[Government of South Africa]] post-1994 and the right to display it in South Africa is protected under [[Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa]] as an expression of free speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Old-flag-still-legal-20091209 |title=Old flag still legal |publisher=News24.com |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, usage of the old South African flag experienced use of as a symbol by [[white supremacists]] not just in South Africa but worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/license/98278021|title=South Africans supporting the white supremacist Afrikaner Resistance...|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Josh Sanburn |url=http://time.com/3927339/dylann-roof-charleston-shooting-flags/ |title=Dylann Roof Wears Flag Linked to White Supremacy Groups |work=Time |date=18 June 2015|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular awareness of this followed the [[Charleston church shooting|shooting at a Charleston, South Carolina black church]] in 2015, as the suspect [[Dylann Roof]] had previously been pictured wearing a jacket with the flag and the [[flag of Rhodesia]] on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nick Baumann |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/18/dylann-roof-rhodesian-flag_n_7616752.html |title=Dylann Roof Had A Rhodesian Flag On His Jacket - Here's What That Tells Us |work=The Huffington Post |date= |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association with apartheid and racism often led to calls for the flags that were used in a historical context, to be removed from display. An example of this is [[Cooma]], Australia, where it is flown to commemorate South African workers in the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]] alongside the [[Canadian Red Ensign]], [[Flag_of_the_United_States#Historical_progression_of_designs|49 star US flag]], and other flags from 1959 when the Avenue was dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beech |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-08-05/south-african-flag-apartheid-era-cooma-avenue-of-flags/6672314 |title=South Africa's apartheid-era flag to keep flying at Cooma's Avenue of Flags: Mayor |publisher=ABC News |date=5 August 2015 |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Old flag of South Africa.jpg|thumb|The flag at the Castle of Good Hope in 2006]]
The flag has also been used as a symbol of protest post-1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/elmien-du-plessis/the-shadow-of-the-oranje-blanje-blou-at-blackmonday_a_23267048/|title=The Shadow Of The Oranje Blanje Blou At #BlackMonday|date=7 November 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, a statue of King Makhado was vandalised in [[Louis Trichardt]] with the colours of the flag as a protest against a proposal to change the name of the town to Makhado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Kings-statue-vandalised-20050914 |title=King's statue vandalised |publisher=News24.com |date=14 September 2005 |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some South Africans in the 21st century started to fly the flag as a protest against what they perceived as the failure of the ANC to make progress in governing South Africa as a democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kiva |first=Mpumi |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/western-cape/why-we-fly-old-flag-at-our-cape-home-1831280 |title='Why we fly old flag at our Cape home' |publisher=IOL |date=13 March 2015 |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Cape Town]]'s [[Castle of Good Hope]], the flag was flown from the castle alongside the Union Jack, [[flag of the Netherlands]] and the current flag of South Africa to display the powers that ruled South Africa through history. In 1994 it was agreed that they would remain on the castle parapet as historical reference. However, in 2012 following complaints from the ANC member of parliament [[Nomfunelo Mabedla]], all the flags were removed from the parapet apart from the current flag of South Africa and the removed flags were placed in the castle's museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.iol.co.za/capetimes/row-erupts-over-castle-flags-1433609 |title=Row erupts over Castle flags |publisher=IOL |date=30 November 2012 |accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the flag was mistakenly put on posters in Ghana advertising that year's [[Africa Cup of Nations]], sparking outrage in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7235415.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Africa - Apartheid flag gaffe sparks row|date=6 January 2018|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106041257/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7235415.stm|archivedate=6 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Ghana-poster-an-embarrassment-to-SA-139026|title=Ghana poster an 'embarrassment' to SA - General News|date=10 February 2008|access-date=6 January 2018|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106042024/https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Ghana-poster-an-embarrassment-to-SA-139026|archivedate=6 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global Trade Watch''' (GTW) was founded by [[Lori Wallach]] in 1995 as a division of the U.S.-based non-profit consumer advocacy organization, [[Public Citizen]], that monitors the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and other [[trade agreements]] such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and the [[Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA), as well as ongoing negotiations over trade agreements such as the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (TPP) and the [[Trans-Atlantic Free Trade Agreement]] (TAFTA / TTIP). Like Public Citizen in general, GTW advocates for a greater public role in international, federal, state and local policy-making, and for a different set of policies and institutions than those governing the current model of [[globalization]].

Global Trade Watch holds a position on the executive board on the [[Citizens Trade Campaign]] and belongs to Our World Is Not For Sale.

==Founding==
[[Lori Wallach]], GTW's Director and Founder was described as "[[Ralph Nader]] with a sense of humor" in a ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' profile, dubbed "the Trade Debate's Guerrilla Warrior" by the ''[[National Journal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/events/reuters/2000-02-09.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060814182855/http://www.jrn.columbia.edu/events/reuters/2000-02-09.asp |archivedate=2006-08-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the "[[Madame Defarge]] of Seattle" by the [[Institute for International Economics]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2633/is_4_14/ai_64564019/print]&lt;/ref&gt; and "a key player in Washington debates on trade policy" by [[The Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0612-33.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826001630/http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0612-33.htm |archivedate=2006-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallach is a graduate of [[Harvard University]] and previously worked for Public Citizen as a lobbyist for food safety improvements.

'''Human rights in the United States''' comprise a series of rights which are legally protected by the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]], including the [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendments]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lauren | first = Paul Gordon | editors = Soohandoo, Cynthia; Albisa, Catherine; Davis, Martha F. | title = Bringing Human Rights Home: Portraits of the Movement

The human rights record of the [[United States of America]] is a complex matter with varying opinions; first and foremost the Federal Government of the United States has, through a ratified [[constitution]], guaranteed [[unalienable]] rights to citizens of the country, and also to some degree, non-citizens. These rights evolved over time through constitutional amendments, supported by legislation and judicial precedent. Along with the rights themselves, the periphery of the population who had access to these rights has expanded over time. Today, the United States has a vibrant civil society and strong constitutional protections for many civil and political rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2017/country-chapters/united-states|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:United States Declaration of Independence.jpg|thumb|200px|In 1776, [[Thomas Jefferson]] proposed a philosophy of human rights inherent to all people in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], asserting that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." Historian [[Joseph J. Ellis]] calls the Declaration "the most quoted statement of human rights in recorded history".&lt;ref name="Ellis-1998"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ellis | first = Joseph J. | authorlink = Joseph Ellis | title = [[American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson]] | publisher = Vintage Books | origyear = 1996 | year = 1998 | page = 63 | isbn =0-679-76441-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The first human rights organization in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of [[British America]], dedicated to the abolition of slavery, was formed by [[Anthony Benezet]] in 1775. A year later, the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] announced that the Thirteen Colonies regarded themselves as independent states, and no longer a part of the [[British Empire]]. The Declaration stated "that [[all men are created equal]], that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are [[Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness|Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]]", echoing [[John Locke]]'s phrase "life, liberty, and property".&lt;ref&gt;[[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pursuit-of-happiness.org/history-of-happiness/john-locke/|title=Locke and Happiness|website=www.pursuit-of-happiness.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of human liberties, which originated from the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], postulates that fundamental rights are not granted by a divine or supernatural being to monarchs who then grant them to subjects, but are granted by a divine or supernatural being to each man (but not woman) and are inalienable and inherent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Henkin|first1=Louis|last2=Rosenthal|first2=Albert J.|title=Constitutionalism and rights: the influence of the United States constitution abroad|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1990|isbn=0-231-06570-1|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Revolutionary War, the former thirteen colonies went through a pre-government phase of more than a decade, with much debate about the form of government they would have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Edmund S.|title=Inventing the People: The Rise of Popular Sovereignty in England and America|year=1989|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=0393306232}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Constitution, adopted in 1787 through ratification at a national convention and conventions in the colonies, created a [[republic]] that guaranteed several rights and civil liberties. However, it did not extend [[voting rights in the United States]] beyond white male property owners (about 6% of the population).&lt;ref name=NatArchives&gt;{{cite web|title=Expansion of Rights and Liberties - The Right of Suffrage|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|website=Online Exhibit: The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706144856/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|archivedate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution did refer to "Persons", not "Men" as was used in the Declaration of Independence, and it omitted any reference to the supernatural imagination (such as a "Creator" or "God") and any authority derived or divined therefrom, and allowed "affirmation" in lieu of an "oath" if preferred.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite book|title=U.S. Constitution|year=1787|chapter=Article VI|quote="The Senators and Representative before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution thus eliminated any requirement of supernatural grant of human rights and provided that they belonged to all Persons (presumably meaning men and women, and perhaps children, although the developmental distinction between children and adults poses issues and has been the subject of subsequent amendments, as discussed below). Some of this conceptualization may have arisen from the significant [[Quakers|Quaker]] segment of the population in the colonies, especially in the Delaware Valley, and their religious views that all human beings, regardless of sex, age, race, or other characteristics, had the same [[Inner light]]. Quaker and Quaker-derived views would have informed the drafting and ratification of the Constitution, including through the direct influence of  some of the [[Framers of the Constitution]], such as [[John Dickinson (politician)|John Dickinson]] and [[Thomas Mifflin]], who were either Quakers themselves or came from regions founded by or heavily populated with Quakers.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g.,{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=David Hackett|title=[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-506905-1|pages=490–498|quote="On the subject of gender, the Quakers had a saying: "In souls, there is no sex." to g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickinson, Mifflin and other Framers who objected to slavery were outvoted on that question, however, and the original Constitution sanctioned slavery (although not based on race or other characteristic of the slave) and, through the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]], counted slaves (who were not defined by race) as three-fifths of a Person for purposes of distribution of taxes and representation in the House of Representatives (although the slaves themselves were discriminated against in voting for such representatives).

As the new Constitution took effect in practice, concern over individual liberties and concentration of power at the federal level, gave rise to the amendment of the Constitution through adoption of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], the first ten amendments of the Constitution. However, this had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 130 years after ratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bill Of Rights: A Brief History|url=https://www.aclu.org/bill-rights-brief-history|publisher=ACLU|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts and legislatures also began to vary in the interpretation of "Person", with some jurisdictions narrowing the meaning of "Person" to cover only people with property, only men, or only white men.  For example, although women had been voting in some states, such as New Jersey, since the founding of the United States, and prior to that in the colonial era, other states denied them the vote.  In 1756 [[Lydia Taft|Lydia Chapin Taft]] voted, casting a vote in the local town hall meeting in place of her deceased husband.&lt;ref name="blackstonedaily.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackstonedaily.com/Journeys/cm-lt.htm |title=Blackstone Valley |publisher=Blackstonedaily.com |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iwdc.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwdc.org/resources/timeline.htm |title=Blackstone Valley |publisher=Blackstonedaily.com |accessdate=June 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722094028/http://www.iwdc.org/resources/timeline.htm |archivedate=July 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwdc.org/resources/timeline.htm |title=Women in Politics: A Timeline |publisher=International Women's Democracy Center |accessdate=January 3, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722094028/http://www.iwdc.org/resources/timeline.htm |archivedate=July 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1777 women lost the right to exercise their vote in New York, in 1780 women lost the right to exercise their vote in Massachusetts, and in 1784 women lost the right to exercise their vote in New Hampshire.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelizlibrary.org/suffrage/ |title=The Liz Library Presents: The Woman Suffrage Timeline |publisher=Thelizlibrary.org |date=August 26, 1920 |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1775 until 1807, the state constitution in New Jersey permitted all persons worth over fifty pounds (about $7,800 adjusted for inflation, with the election laws referring to the voters as "he or she") to vote; provided they had this property, free black men and single women regardless of race therefore had the vote until 1807, but not married women, who could have no independent claim to ownership of fifty pounds (anything they owned or earned belonged to their husbands by the [[Common law]] of [[Coverture]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oah.org/pubs/magazine/earlyrepublic/cohen.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712095046/http://www.oah.org/pubs/magazine/earlyrepublic/cohen.html |archivedate=July 12, 2007 |title= 	
Women in the Early Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1790, the law was revised to specifically include women, but in 1807 the law was again revised to exclude them, an unconstitutional act since the state constitution specifically made any such change dependent on the general suffrage.  See [[Women's suffrage in the United States]].  Through the doctrine of [[coverture]], many states also denied married women the right to own property in their own name, although most allowed single women (widowed, divorced or never married) the "Person" status of men, sometimes pursuant to the common law concept of a [[femme sole]].   Over the years, a variety of claimants sought to assert that discrimination against women in voting, in property ownership, in occupational license, and other matters was unconstitutional given the Constitution's use of the term "Person", but the all-male courts did not give this fair hearing.  See, e.g., [[Bradwell v. Illinois]].

In the 1860s, after decades of conflict over southern states' continued practice of slavery, and northern states' outlawing it, the [[Civil War (United States)|Civil War]] was fought, and in its aftermath the Constitution was amended to prohibit slavery and to prohibit states' denying rights granted in the Constitution.  Among these amendments was the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which included an [[Equal Protection Clause]] which seemed to clarify that courts and states were prohibited in narrowing the meaning of "Persons".  After the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was adopted, [[Susan B. Anthony]], buttressed by the equal protection language, voted.  She was prosecuted for this, however, and ran into an all-male court ruling that women were not "Persons"; the court levied a fine but it was never collected.

[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mathew Ahmann in a crowd.) - NARA - 542015 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|230px|Martin Luther King at the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C]]]]
Fifty years later, in 1920, the Constitution was amended again, with the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]] to definitively prohibit discrimination against women's suffrage.

In the 1970s, the [[Burger Court]] made a series of rulings clarifying that discrimination against women in the status of being Persons violated the Constitution and acknowledged that previous court rulings to the contrary had been [[Sui generis]] and an abuse of power.  The most often cited of these is [[Reed v. Reed]], which held that any discrimination against either sex in the rights associated with Person status must meet a strict scrutiny standard.

The 1970s also saw the adoption of the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-sixth Amendment]], which prohibited discrimination on the basis of age, for Persons 18 years old and over, in voting.  Other attempts to address the developmental distinction between children and adults in Person status and rights have been addressed mostly by the Supreme Court, with the Court recognizing in 2012, in [[Miller v. Alabama]] a political and biological principle that children are different from adults.

In 1945 the members of the [[United Nations organization]] completed the drafting of its founding text – the United nations charter: The USA played a significant role in this process.&lt;ref name="Ignatieff1"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Ignatieff | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Ignatieff | chapter = Introduction: American Exceptionalism and Human Rights | title = American Exceptionalism and Human Rights | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-691-11648-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights Drafting Committee was chaired by former [[First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt]], who was known for her human rights advocacy. Similarly, for the United States government and its citizens, much remained uncertain about the future impact, force, and reach of international human rights. Eventually the United States had not yet developed a policy approach regarding whether or not it would recognize international human rights within a domestic context. Certainly there were already some domestic political attempts, as for example [[President Truman's]] [[Committee on Civil rights]], which authored a report in 1947 initializing the possibility to apply the [[UN charter]] in order to combat racial discrimination in the US. Now that the United States had successfully adopted the UDHR, obviously it seemed like human rights would play a leading part in domestic law within the US. Still there was harsh controversy over the question whether to apply international law on the inner-land-basis. Though William H. Fitzpatrick won the [[Pulitzer Price for editorial writing]] in 1951; in his editorials he had repeatedly warned against international human rights overthrowing the supreme law of the land. Indeed, Fitzpatrick's concerns and motivations – as well as those of his readers – stood for the longstanding, bitter social and political struggles that divided much of the United States at the time, keeping in mind that in the 1940s and 1950s racial divisions, political exclusion, and gender inequalities were basic facts of American social life.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geschichte-menschenrechte.de/schluesseltexte/william-h-fitzpatricks-editorials-on-human-rights-1949/  |title=William H. Fitzpatrick’s Editorials on Human Rights (1949) |author=Christopher N. J. Roberts  |publisher=Quellen zur Geschichte der Menschenrechte |accessdate=November 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, today there is little worry in the United States about the effect that human rights might have on its domestic law. Over the past few decades, the United States government has often held itself up as a strong supporter of human rights in the international arena. Nonetheless, in the view of the government human rights are still rather an international than a domestic phenomenon – representing more of choice than obligation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Having today overcome many of the inequalities from more than half a dozen decades before, still the United States is in violation of the Declaration, in as much that "everyone has the right to leave any country" because the government may prevent the entry and exit of anyone from the United States for foreign policy, national security, or [[child support]] [[arrears|rearage]] reasons by revoking their passport.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Haig v. Agee]], [[s:Passport Act of 1926|Passport Act of 1926]], {{USC|18|1185(b)}} and the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] of 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  The United States is also in violation of the United Nations' human rights [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] which requires both parents to have a relationship with the child.  Conflict between the human rights of the child and those of a mother or father who wishes to leave the country without paying child support or doing the personal work of child care for his child can be considered to be a question of [[negative and positive rights]].

==Legal framework==
[[File:Constitution of the United States, page 1.jpg|thumb|Original page of the United States Constitution]]

===Domestic legal protection structure===
According to ''Human Rights: The Essential Reference'', "the American Declaration of Independence was the first civic document that met a modern definition of human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Devine|first=Carol|author2=Carol Rae Hansen |author3=Ralph Wilde |author4=Hilary Poole |title=Human rights: The essential reference|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1999|pages=26–29|isbn= 9781573562058|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4NjST_gT9WIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA29,M1|accessdate=November 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution recognizes a number of inalienable human rights, including [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of assembly]], [[freedom of religion]], the [[right to arms|right to keep and bear arms]], freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, and the right to a fair [[trial (law)|trial]] by jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Leebrick|first=Kristal|title=The United States Constitution|publisher=Capstone Press|year=2002|isbn=0-7368-1094-3|pages=26–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Constitutional amendment]]s have been enacted as the needs of the society evolved. The [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] recognized that not all human rights were enumerated in the original United States Constitution. The [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] of 1964 and the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] of 1990 are examples of human rights that were enumerated by Congress well after the Constitution's writing. The scope of the legal protections of human rights afforded by the US government is defined by case law, particularly by the precedent of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].

Within the federal government, the debate about what may or may not be an emerging human right is held in two forums: the United States Congress, which may enumerate these; and the Supreme Court, which may articulate rights that the law does not spell out. Additionally, individual states, through court action or legislation, have often protected human rights not recognized at federal level. For example, Massachusetts was the first of several states to recognize same sex marriage.&lt;ref name="legal"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Kathleen|last=Burge|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2003/11/18/sjc_gay_marriage_legal_in_mass/|title=SJC: Gay marriage legal in Mass.|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=November 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of international treaties===
In the context of human rights and treaties that recognize or create individual rights, U.S. constitutional law makes a distinction between self-executing and non-self-executing treaties. Non-self-executing treaties, which ascribe rights that under the constitution may be assigned by law, require legislative action to execute the contract (treaty) before it becomes a part of domestic law.&lt;ref&gt;''Foster v. Neilson, 27 U.S. 253, 314-15 (1829) U.S. Supreme Court'', Chief Justice Marshall writing: "Our constitution declares a treaty to be the law of the land. It is, consequently, to be regarded in courts of justice as equivalent to an act of the legislature, whenever it operates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision. But when the terms of the stipulation import a contract, when either of the parties engages to perform a particular act, the treaty addresses itself to the political, not the judicial department, and the legislature must execute the contract before it can become a rule for the Court." at 314, cited in Martin &lt;u&gt;International Human Rights and Humanitarian Law&lt;/u&gt; et al.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also cases that explicitly require legislative approval according to the Constitution, such as cases that could commit the U.S. to declare war or appropriate funds.

Treaties regarding human rights, which create a duty to refrain from acting in a particular manner or confer specific rights, are generally held to be self-executing, requiring no further legislative action. In cases where legislative bodies refuse to recognize otherwise self-executing treaties by ''declaring them to be non-self-executing'' in an act of legislative non-recognition, constitutional scholars argue that such acts violate the separation of powers{{mdash}}in cases of controversy, the judiciary, not Congress, has the authority under Article III to apply treaty law to cases before the court. This is a key provision in cases where the Congress declares a human rights treaty to be non-self-executing, for example, by contending it does not add anything to human rights under U.S. domestic law. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is one such case, which, while ratified after more than two decades of inaction, was done so with reservations, understandings, and declarations.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, F.&lt;u&gt;International Human Rights and Humanitarian Law&lt;/u&gt;. Cambridge University Press. 2006. p. 221 and following. {{ISBN|0-521-85886-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-85886-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the principle of ''pacta sunt servanda'' a country may not invoke provisions of its domestic laws or constitution as justification for failure to comply with its international law obligations. Therefore, if a human rights treaty has been ratified by the U.S. but is not considered self-executing, or has not yet been implemented by legislation, it is nonetheless binding on the U.S. government as a matter of international law.

==Equality==

===Racial===

[[File:Lyndon Johnson signing Civil Rights Act, July 2, 1964.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signs the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. Among the guests behind him is [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]]]
The [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] guarantees that "All persons born or naturalized in the United States ... are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws"&lt;ref&gt;McWhirter, Darien A.m ''Equal Protection', Oryx Press, 1995, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibits the denial of a citizen of the right to vote based on that citizen's "race, color, or previous condition of servitude".

The United States has enacted comprehensive legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race and national origin in the workplace in the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] (CRA).&lt;ref name="Gould27"/&gt; The CRA is perhaps the most prominent civil rights legislation enacted in modern times, has served as a model for subsequent anti-discrimination laws and has greatly expanded civil rights protections in a wide variety of settings.&lt;ref name="Capozzi6"&gt;Capozzi, Irene Y., ''The Civil Rights Act: background, statutes and primer'', Nova Publishers, 2006, {{ISBN|1-60021-131-3}}, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; The 1991 provision created recourse for victims of such discrimination for [[punitive damages]] and full back pay.&lt;ref name="Nivola02127"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Nivola | first = Pietro S. | title = ''Tense commandments: federal prescriptions and city problems'', | publisher = Brookings Institution Press | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-8157-6094-9| pages= 127–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to individual civil recourse, the United States possesses anti-discrimination government enforcement bodies, such as the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]].&lt;ref name="Nivola02127"/&gt;

Beginning in 1965, the United States also began a program of [[affirmative action]] that not only obliges employers not to discriminate, but requires them to provide preferences for groups protected under the Civil Rights Act to increase their numbers where they are judged to be underrepresented.&lt;ref name="russel147"/&gt; Such affirmative action programs are also applied in college admissions.&lt;ref name="russel147"/&gt;

The United States also [[National Voting Rights Act of 1965|prohibits the imposition of any "...&amp;nbsp;voting qualification or prerequisite to voting]], or standard, practice, or procedure&amp;nbsp;... to deny or abridge the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color," which prevents the use of [[grandfather clause]]s, [[literacy test]]s, [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] and [[white primaries]].

And no human law can deprive him of the right which he derives from the law of nature."

Prior to the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], [[slavery]] was legal in some states of the United States until 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Vorenberg, Michael, ''Final Freedom: The Civil War, the Abolition of Slavery, and the Thirteenth Amendment'', Cambridge University Press, 2001, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; Influenced by the principles of the [[Religious Society of Friends]], [[Anthony Benezet]] formed the [[Pennsylvania Abolition Society]] in 1775, believing that all ethnic groups were considered equal and that human slavery was incompatible with Christian beliefs. Benezet extended the recognition of human rights to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and he argued for a peaceful solution to the violence between the Native and European Americans. [[Benjamin Franklin]] became the president of Benezet's abolition society in the late 18th century. In addition, the Fourteenth Amendment was interpreted to permit what was termed ''[[Separate but equal]]'' treatment of minorities until the [[United States Supreme Court]] overturned this interpretation in 1954, which consequently overturned [[Jim Crow laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Martin | first = Waldo E. | title = Brown v.

[[File:Rose-Sanderson-Votes-for-Women.jpeg|thumb|U.S. women suffragists demonstrating for the right to vote, February 1913]]
The [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibits the states and the federal government from denying any citizen the right to vote because of that citizen's sex.&lt;ref name="lc"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/amdt19_user.html#amdt19_hd2 Nineteenth Amendment], CRS/LII Annotated Constitution&lt;/ref&gt; While this does not necessarily guarantee all women the right to vote, as [[suffrage]] qualifications are determined by individual states, it does mean that states' suffrage qualifications may not prevent women from voting due to their gender.&lt;ref name="lc"/&gt;

The United States has enacted comprehensive [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|CRA]] legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Gould27"&gt;Gould, William B., ''Agenda for Reform: The Future of Employment Relationships and the Law''&lt; MIT Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-262-57114-5}}, page 27&lt;/ref&gt; The 1991 provision created recourse for discrimination victims for [[punitive damages]] and full back pay.&lt;ref name="Nivola02127"/&gt; In addition to individual civil recourse, the United States possesses anti-discrimination government enforcement bodies, such as the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/herman/reports/futurework/conference/staffing/9.7_discrimination.htm|title=Anti-discrimination Laws - Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management (OASAM) - United States Department of Labor|website=www.dol.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disability===
{{See also|Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Timeline of disability rights in the United States}}
The United States has adopted antidiscrimination legislation for people with disabilities, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA).&lt;ref name="midgley"&gt;Midgley, James, and Michelle Livermore, ''The Handbook of Social Policy'', SAGE, 2008, {{ISBN|1-4129-5076-7}}, page 448&lt;/ref&gt; The ADA reflected a dramatic shift toward the employment of persons with disabilities to enhance the labor force participation of qualified persons with disabilities and to reduce their dependence on government entitlement programs. {{dubious|date=September 2015}} &lt;ref name="blanck3"&gt;Blanck, Peter David and David L. Braddock, ''The Americans with Disabilities Act and the emerging workforce: employment of people with mental retardation'', AAMR, 1998, {{ISBN|0-940898-52-7}}, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; The ADA amends the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|CRA]] and permits plaintiffs to recover [[punitive damages]].&lt;ref name="Capozzi60"&gt;Capozzi, Irene Y., ''The Civil Rights Act: background, statutes and primer'', Nova Publishers, 2006, {{ISBN|1-60021-131-3}}, page 60-61&lt;/ref&gt; The ADA has been instrumental in the evolution of disability discrimination law in the United States.&lt;ref name="Lawson89"&gt;Lawson, Anna, Caroline Gooding, ''Disability rights in Europe: from theory to practice'', Hart Publishing, 2005, {{ISBN|1-84113-486-4}}, page 89&lt;/ref&gt; Although ADA Title I was [[Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett|found to be unconstitutional]], the [[Bragdon v. Abbott|Supreme Court has extended the protection]] to people with [[Acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS).&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Nancy Lee, ''The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): overview, regulations and interpretations'', Nova Publishers, 2003, {{ISBN|1-59033-663-1}}, pages 7-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal benefits such as [[Social Security Disability Insurance]] (SSDI) and [[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI) are often administratively viewed in the United States as being primarily or near-exclusively the entitlement only of [[impoverished]] U.S. [[people with disabilities]], and not applicable to those with disabilities who make significantly above-[[poverty level]] income. This is proven in practice by the general fact that in the U.S., a disabled person on SSI without significant employment income who is suddenly employed, with a salary or wage at or above the [[living wage]] threshold, often discovers that government benefits they were previously entitled to have ceased, because supposedly the new job "invalidates" the need for this assistance. However, the Stephen Beck, Jr. Achieving a Better Life Experience Act of 2014 (the ABLE Act) amended Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Service Code of 1986 to create tax-free savings accounts (ABLE accounts) for qualified expenses, and with these accounts (each person may have only one account) people with disabilities who have a condition that occurred before age 26 can save up to $100,000 without risking eligibility for [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and other government programs.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insurancenewsnet.com/oarticle/2014/12/22/crenshaws-able-act-signed-into-law-a-580766.html#.VJjLYecA|title=Crenshaw's ABLE Act Signed Into Law|work=InsuranceNewsNet|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also keep their [[Medicaid]] coverage no matter how much money they accrue in their ABLE account. Under current gift-tax limitations as of 2014, as much as $14,000 could be deposited annually. However, each state must put regulations in place so that financial institutions can make the ABLE accounts available, and there is no guarantee a particular state will do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.disabilityscoop.com/2014/12/22/obama-signs-able-act/19935/|title=Obama Signs ABLE Act|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SSI benefits also require frequent reviews to "prove" the person is still disabled, and require the disabled person to be diligent about returning [[:wikt:paperwork|paperwork]] and reporting any income they make, raising concerns that it is unfair to people with disabilities, especially those with mental disabilities who are often unaware of how to navigate the complex [[bureaucracy]] needed to not lose their benefits, a situation not dissimilar to [[probation]]. The U.S. is the only industrialized country in the world to have this particular approach to disability assistance programming. These factors make it so that disabled people are in some senses [[second class citizen]]s.

===Privacy===
{{See also|Mass surveillance in the United States|Privacy laws of the United States}}
Privacy is not explicitly stated in the United States Constitution. In the ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' case, the Supreme Court ruled that it is implied in the Constitution. In the ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' case, the Supreme Court used privacy rights to overturn most laws against [[abortion in the United States]]. In the ''[[Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health]]'' case, the Supreme Court held that the patient had a right of privacy to terminate medical treatment. In ''[[Gonzales v. Oregon]]'', the Supreme Court held that the Federal [[Controlled Substances Act]] can not prohibit [[Euthanasia|physician-assisted suicide]] allowed by the [[Oregon Death with Dignity Act]]. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of criminalizing oral and anal sex in the ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'' {{ussc|478|186|1986}} decision; however, it overturned the decision in the ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' {{ussc|539|558|2003}} case and established the protection to sexual privacy.

===Accused===
The United States maintains a [[presumption of innocence]] in legal procedures. The [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth]], [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]], [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] deals with the rights of criminal suspects. Later the protection was extended to civil cases as well&lt;ref&gt;''McCarthy v. Arndstein'', 266 U.S. 34 (1924)&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' case, the Supreme Court requires that indigent criminal defendants who are unable to afford their own attorney be provided counsel at trial. Since the ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' case, the United States requires police departments to inform arrested persons of their rights, which is later called [[Miranda warning]] and typically begins with "You have the right to remain silent."

==Freedoms==

===Freedom of religion===
{{Main|Freedom of religion in the United States}}

The [[Establishment Clause|establishment clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|first amendment]] prohibits the establishment of a national religion by Congress or the preference of one religion over another. The clause was used to limit [[school prayer|school praying]], beginning with ''[[Engel v. Vitale]]'', which ruled government-led prayer unconstitutional. ''[[Wallace v. Jaffree]]'' banned moments of silence allocated for praying. The Supreme Court also ruled clergy-led prayer at public high school graduations unconstitutional with ''[[Lee v. Weisman]]''.

The [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|free exercise clause]] guarantees the free exercise of religion. The Supreme Court's ''[[Lemon v. Kurtzman]]'' decision established the "Lemon test" exception, which details the requirements for legislation concerning religion. In the ''[[Employment Division v. Smith]]'' decision, the Supreme Court maintained a "neutral law of general applicability" can be used to limit religion exercises. In the ''[[City of Boerne v. Flores]]'' decision, the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]] was struck down as exceeding congressional power; however, the decision's effect is limited by the ''[[Gonzales v.

{{Main|Freedom of speech in the United States|Censorship in the United States}}

The United States is a constitutional republic based on founding documents that restrict the power of government and preserve the liberty of the people. The freedom of expression (including speech, [[Freedom of the press|media]], and [[Freedom of association|public assembly]]) is an important right and is given special protection, as declared by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] of the constitution. According to Supreme Court precedent, the federal and lower governments may not apply [[prior restraint]] to expression, with certain exceptions, such as national security and obscenity.  Legal limits on expression include:

*[[Solicitation]], [[fraud]], specific threats of violence, or disclosure of [[classified information]]
*Advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government through speech or publication, or organizing political parties that advocate the overthrow of the U.S. government (the [[Smith Act]])&lt;ref name="Dennis vs. United States"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Dennis vs. United States|publisher=Audio Case Files|accessdate=September 6, 2008|url=http://www.audiocasefiles.com/acf_cases/9769-dennis-v-united-states}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Civil offenses involving [[defamation]], fraud, or workplace [[harassment]]
*[[Copyright]] violations
*[[Federal Communications Commission]] rules governing the use of [[broadcast media]]
*Crimes involving sexual [[Obscenity#United States obscenity law|obscenity]] in [[Censorship in the United States#Censorship of pornography|pornography]] and [[Obscenity#Non image-based obscenity cases in the USA|text only erotic stories]].
*Ordinances requiring mass demonstrations on public property to register in advance.
*The use of [[free speech zone]]s and [[exclusion zone|protest free zones]].
*Military censorship of [[blogs]] written by military personnel claiming some include [[OPSEC|sensitive information ineligible for release]]. Some critics view military officials as trying to suppress dissent from troops in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=U.S. Army clamping down on soldiers' blogs|publisher=Reuters (CNN)|date=May 2, 2007|accessdate=May 27, 2007|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/internet/05/02/army.blogs.reut/index.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070522034642/http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/internet/05/02/army.blogs.reut/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3867981|title=Soldiers' Iraq Blogs Face Military Scrutiny|date=August 24, 2004|accessdate=June 14, 2007|publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Constitution specifically limits the human rights of active duty members, and this constitutional authority is used to limit speech rights by members in this and in other ways.

Some laws remain controversial due to concerns that they infringe on freedom of expression. These include the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.com/2100-1023-251627.html|publisher=[[CNET]]|first=John|last=Borland|title=Battle lines harden over Net copyright|date=February 26, 2001|accessdate=May 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Fatal Flaws in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]]|accessdate=May 27, 2007|url=http://www.brookings.edu/dybdocroot/gs/cf/debate/Bopp.pdf|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070616101509/http://www.brookings.edu/dybdocroot/gs/cf/debate/Bopp.pdf |archivedate = June 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In two high-profile cases, grand juries have decided that ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reporter Matthew Cooper and ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter Judith Miller must reveal their sources in cases involving CIA leaks. Time magazine exhausted its legal appeals, and Mr. Cooper eventually agreed to testify. Miller was jailed for 85 days before cooperating. U.S. District Chief Judge Thomas F. Hogan ruled that the First Amendment does not insulate ''Time'' magazine reporters from a requirement to testify before a criminal grand jury that's conducting the investigation into the possible illegal disclosure of classified information.

Approximately 30,000 government employees and contractors are currently employed to monitor telephone calls and other communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/09/04/zakaria-why-america-overreacted-to-9-11.html |author=Fareed Zakaria |title=What America Has Lost |work=Newsweek |date=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, leaked documents revealed that the government and some large corporations had censored many blogs and news articles using existing surveillance programs.

====Right to peaceably assemble====
Although Americans enjoy the freedom to peacefully protest, [[Mass arrest#Mass arrests of protesters in the United States|protesters are infrequently arrested]], beaten, mistreated, jailed or fired upon which resulted in lawsuits or criminal prosecutions.

Protesters have also been arrested for protesting outside of designated "free speech zones".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/article/20030807/NEWS/308070381| title=Anti-Bush protesters sue over arrests| work=Herald Tribune| date=August 7, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City, over 1,700 protesters were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/08/25/politics/main638348.shtml| author=Jarrett Murphy| title=A Raw Deal For RNC Protesters?| publisher=CBS News| date=September 3, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, 1970, Ohio National Guardsmen [[Kent State shootings|opened fire on protesting students at Kent State University]], killing four students. Investigators determined that 28 Guardsmen fired 61 to 67 shots. The Justice Department concluded that the Guardsmen were not in danger and that their claim that they fired in self-defense was untrue. The nearest student was almost 100 yards away at the time of the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-05-03-kent-state_N.htm| author=Rick Hampson| title=1970 Kent State shootings are an enduring history lesson| work=USA Today| date=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guards involved in the shooting were indicted. Eight of the guardsmen were indicted by a grand jury. The guardsmen claimed to have fired in self-defense, a claim that was generally accepted by the criminal justice system. In 1974 U.S. District Judge Frank Battisti dismissed charges against all eight on the basis that the prosecution's case was too weak to warrant a trial.&lt;ref name=lewis_hensley&gt;{{cite journal|first=Jerry M. |last=Lewis |author2=Thomas R.

===Freedom of movement===
{{Further|Freedom of movement under United States law}}
As per § 707(b) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|95|426|92|993|1978|10|07}}, {{USC|18|1185(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States passport]]s are required to enter and exit the country, and as per the [[s:Passport Act of 1926|Passport Act of 1926]] and [[Haig v.

Perhaps the most notable example of enforcement of this ability was the 1948 denial of a passport to [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Leo Isacson]], who sought to go to Paris to attend a conference as an observer for the American Council for a Democratic Greece, a [[Communist front]] organization, because of the group's role in opposing the Greek government in the [[Greek Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Haig v.

On June 30, 2010, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] filed a lawsuit on behalf of ten people who are either U.S. citizens or legal residents of the U.S., challenging the constitutionality of the government's "no-fly" list.

It is estimated that the "no-fly" list contained about 8,000 names at the time of the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/01/us/01brfs-ACLUSUESOVER_BRF.html |author=Scott Shane |title=A.C.L.U.

The following case precedents are typically incorrectly cited in defense of unencumbered travel within the United States:

"The use of the highway for the purpose of travel and transportation is not a mere privilege, but a common fundamental right of which the public and individuals cannot rightfully be deprived." Chicago Motor Coach v. Chicago, 337 Ill. 200; 169 N.E. 22 (1929).

"The right of the citizen to travel upon the public highways and to transport his property thereon, either by carriage or by automobile, is not a mere privilege which a city may prohibit or permit at will, but a common law right which he has under the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." Thompson v. Smith, Supreme Court of Virginia, 155 Va. 367; 154 S.E. 579; (1930).

"Undoubtedly the right of locomotion, the right to move from one place to another according to inclination, is an attribute of personal liberty, and the right, ordinarily, of free transit from or through the territory of any State is a right secured by the 14th amendment and by other provisions of the Constitution." Schactman v. Dulles, 225 F.2d 938; 96 U.S. App. D.C. 287 (1955).

"The right to travel is a well-established common right that does not owe its existence to the federal government. It is recognized by the courts as a natural right." Schactman v. Dulles 225 F.2d 938; 96 U.S. App. D.C. 287 (1955) at 941.

"The right to travel is a part of the liberty of which the citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment." [[Kent v. Dulles]], 357 US 116, 125 (1958).

===Freedom of association===
{{Further|Freedom of association}}
[[Freedom of association]] is the right of individuals to come together in groups for political action or to pursue common interests.

Freedom of association in the U.S. is restricted by the [[Smith Act]], which bans political parties that advocate the violent overthrow of the U.S. government.&lt;ref name="Dennis vs. United States"/&gt;

Between 1956 and 1971, the [[FBI]] attempted to "expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, or otherwise neutralize" radical groups through the [[COINTELPRO]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/hueypnewton/actions/actions_cointelpro.html |title=COINTELPRO |publisher=PBS | accessdate=June 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the Maryland State Police admitted that they had added the names of Iraq War protesters and death penalty opponents to a terrorist database. They also admitted that other "protest groups" were added to the terrorist database, but did not specify which groups. It was also discovered that undercover troopers used aliases to infiltrate organizational meetings, rallies and group e-mail lists. Police admitted there was "no evidence whatsoever of any involvement in violent crime" by those classified as terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/07/AR2008100703245.html |author=Lisa Rein |title=Md.

===Right of revolution===
{{Main|Right of revolution}}
The right of revolution is the right or duty of the people of a nation to overthrow a government that acts against their common interests, and is a traditional assumption in American political thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnhar|first1=Larry|title=Political Questions: Political Philosophy from Plato to Pinker|publisher=Waveland Press|location=Long Grove, IL|isbn=978-1-4786-2906-1|page=200|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to revolution played a large part in the writings of the [[American Revolution|American revolutionaries]] in the run up to the [[American Revolution]]. The political tract ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' used the concept as an argument for rejection of the British Monarchy and separation from the [[British Empire]], as opposed to merely self-government within it. It was also cited in the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]] of the United States, when a group of representatives from the various states signed a declaration of independence citing charges against King [[George III]]. As the American [[Declaration of Independence]] in 1776 expressed it, natural law taught that the people were "endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights" and could alter or abolish government "destructive" of those rights.

===National security exceptions===
{{Further|National Security Strategy of the United States|Mass surveillance in the United States}}
The United States government has declared [[martial law]],&lt;ref name="ada.asn.au"&gt;http://www.ada.asn.au/defender/Winter%202004/Review%20-%20Supreme%20Command%20(Defender,%20Winter%202004).pdf {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909222624/http://www.ada.asn.au/defender/Winter%202004/Review%20-%20Supreme%20Command%20%28Defender%2C%20Winter%202004%29.pdf |date=September 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suspended (or claimed exceptions to) some rights on national security grounds, typically in wartime and conflicts such as the [[United States Civil War]],&lt;ref name="ada.asn.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="constitutional2002"&gt;Constitutional Dictatorship: Crisis Government in the Modern Democracies. Clinton Rossiter. 2002. Page X. {{ISBN|0-7658-0975-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cold War]] or the [[War on Terrorism|War against Terror]].&lt;ref name="constitutional2002"/&gt; 70,000 Americans of Japanese ancestry were legally interned during [[World War II]] under [[Executive Order 9066]]. In some instances the federal courts have allowed these exceptions, while in others the courts have decided that the national security interest was insufficient. Presidents Lincoln, Wilson, and F.D. Roosevelt ignored such judicial decisions.&lt;ref name="constitutional2002"/&gt;

====Historical restrictions====
Sedition laws have sometimes placed restrictions on freedom of expression. The [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], passed by President [[John Adams]] during an undeclared naval conflict with [[France]], allowed the government to punish "false" statements about the government and to deport "dangerous" immigrants. The [[Federalist Party]] used these acts to harass many supporters of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]]. While [[Woodrow Wilson]] was president, broad legislation called the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and [[Sedition Act of 1918]] were passed during [[World War I]]. Thousands were jailed for violations of these laws, which prohibited criticizing conscription and the government, or sending literature through the [[US Mail]] doing the same. Most prominently it led to the conviction of [[Socialist Party of America]] Presidential candidate [[Eugene V. Debs]] for speaking out against US participation in World War I and conscription. Debs received ten years in prison, and ran for president a third time while in prison (on December 25, 1921, his sentence was commuted by President [[Warren G. Harding]], releasing Debs early). Numerous [[conscientious objector]]s to conscription were also jailed, with a few dying due to mistreatment. In the post-war [[Palmer Raids]], foreign-born dissidents were arrested in the thousands without legal warrants, and deported for their political beliefs.

Presidents have claimed the power to imprison summarily, under military jurisdiction, those suspected of being combatants for states or groups at war against the United States. [[Abraham Lincoln]] invoked this power in the [[American Civil War]] to imprison [[Maryland]] secessionists. In that case, the Supreme Court concluded that only [[United States Congress|Congress]] could suspend the writ of [[habeas corpus]], and the government released the detainees. During [[World War II]], the United States [[Japanese American internment|interned thousands of Japanese-Americans]] on alleged fears that [[Japan]] might use them as saboteurs-the US Supreme Court upheld this policy.

The [[Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution]] forbids unreasonable search and seizure without a [[warrant (legal)|warrant]], but some administrations have claimed exceptions to this rule to investigate alleged [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracies]] against the government. During the [[Cold War]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] established [[COINTELPRO]] to infiltrate and disrupt left-wing organizations, including those that supported the rights of [[black Americans]].

National security, as well as other concerns like [[unemployment]], has sometimes led the United States to toughen its generally liberal [[immigration]] policy. The [[Chinese Exclusion Act (United States)|Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882 all but banned [[China|Chinese]] immigrants, who were accused of [[crowding out (economics)|crowding out]] American workers.

====Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative====
The federal government has set up a data collection and storage network that keeps a wide variety of data on tens of thousands of Americans who have not been accused of committing a crime. Operated primarily under the direction of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the program is known as the [[Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative]] or SAR. Reports of suspicious behavior noticed by local law enforcement or by private citizens are forwarded to the program, and profiles are constructed of the persons under suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/12/20/politics/washingtonpost/main7167877.shtml|author1=Dana Priest |author2=William M.

In 1935, the [[National Labor Relations Act]] recognized and protected "the rights of most workers in the private sector to organize labor unions, to engage in collective bargaining, and to take part in strikes and other forms of concerted activity in support of their demands." However, many states hold to the principle of [[at-will employment]], which says an employee can be fired for any or no reason, without warning and without recourse, unless violation of State or Federal civil rights laws can be proven. In 2011, 11.8% of U.S. workers were members of labor unions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm| title=Union Members Summary| publisher=U.S. Dept. of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics| date=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 37% of public sector (government) workers in unions while only 6.9% of private sector workers were union members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/28/business/union-membership-rate-fell-again-in-2011.html| author=Steven Greenhouse| title=Union Membership Rate Fell Again in 2011| work=The New York Times| date=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States' [[Maternity leave in the United States|maternity leave]] policy is distinct from other industrialized countries for its relative scarcity of benefits. The length of protected maternity leave ranks 20th out of the 21 high-income countries. Moreover, most foreign wealthy nations provide some form of wage compensation for the leave of absence; the United States is the only one of these 21 countries that does not offer such paid leave.&lt;ref name="grs"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gornick|first1=Janet|last2=Ray|first2=Rebecca|last3=Schmitt|first3=John|title=Parental Leave in 21 Countries: Assessing Generosity and Gender Equality|publisher=Center for Economic and Policy Research|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the United States and [[Papua New Guinea]] are the only countries in the world that do not guarantee paid maternal leave by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://national.deseretnews.com/article/4450/US-one-of-only-two-nations-without-guaranteed-paid-maternity-leave.html|title=InDepth|website=DeseretNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], adopted by the [[United Nations]] in 1948, states that "everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of oneself and one's family, including food, clothing, housing, and medical care."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhchc.org/humanright.html|title=Human Rights, Homelessness and Health Care|author=National Health Care for the Homeless Council|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610180442/http://www.nhchc.org/humanright.html|archivedate=June 10, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the ''Principles of Medical Ethics'' of the American Medical Association require medical doctors to respect the human rights of the patient, including that of providing medical treatment when it is needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category/2512.html|title=Principles of medical ethics|author=American Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans' rights in health care are regulated by the [[US Patients' Bill of Rights]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Unlike most other industrialized nations, the United States does not offer most of its citizens subsidized health care. The United States [[Medicaid]] program provides subsidized coverage to some categories of individuals and families with low incomes and resources, including children, pregnant women, and very low-income people with disabilities (higher-earning people with disabilities do not qualify for Medicaid, although they do qualify for Medicare). However, according to Medicaid's own documents, "the Medicaid program does not provide health care services, even for very poor people, unless they are in one of the designated eligibility groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidGenInfo/ |title=Overview - What is Not Covered |publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402070638/http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidGenInfo/ |archivedate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, some states offer subsidized health insurance to broader populations. Coverage is subsidized for persons age 65 and over, or who meet other special criteria through [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]. Every person with a permanent disability, both young and old, is inherently entitled to [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] health benefits — a fact not all disabled US citizens are aware of. However, just like every other Medicare recipient, a disabled person finds that his or her Medicare benefits only cover up to 80% of what the insurer considers reasonable charges in the U.S. medical system, and that the other 20% plus the difference in the reasonable amount and the actual charge must be paid by other means (typically supplemental, privately held insurance plans, or cash out of the person's own pocket). Therefore, even the Medicare program is not truly [[national health insurance]] or [[universal health care]] the way most of the rest of the industrialized world understands it.

The 1972 US Supreme Court case ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'' {{ussc|408|238|1972}} held that arbitrary imposition of the death penalty at the states' discretion constituted [[cruel and unusual punishment]] in violation of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. This was preceded with the [[Supreme Court of California]]'s ruling in ''[[California v. Anderson]]'' 64 Cal.2d 633, 414 P.2d 366 (Cal. 1972), which classified capital punishment as [[Cruel and unusual punishment|cruel and unusual]] and outlawed the use of capital punishment in California (however, this was reversed the same year through a [[ballot initiative]], [[California Proposition 17 (1972)|Proposition 17]]). It was reinstated nationally in 1976 after the US Supreme Court rulings [[Gregg v. Georgia]], {{ussc|428|153|1976}}, ''[[Jurek v. Texas]]'', {{ussc|428|262|1976}}, and [[Proffitt v.

The UN special [[rapporteur]] recommended to a committee of the UN General Assembly that the United States be found to be in violation of Article 6 the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] in regards to the death penalty in 1998, and called for an immediate capital punishment moratorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Rights Watch|url=https://www.un.org/Pubs/chronicle/1998/issue2/0298p72.html|title=Death Penalty Issue Addressed by Special Rapporteur|publisher=UN Chronicle|volume= XXXV|issue= 2 |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendation of the special [[rapporteur]] is not legally binding under international law, and in this case the UN did not act upon the lawyer's recommendation.

Since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976 there have been 1077 executions in the United States (as of May 23, 2007).&lt;ref name = "Death Penalty Info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org|title=DPIC - Death Penalty Information Center|website=www.deathpenaltyinfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 53 executions in 2006.&lt;ref name = "Death Row USA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?scid=8&amp;did=146|title=DPIC - Death Penalty Information Center|website=www.deathpenaltyinfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas overwhelmingly leads the United States in executions, with 379 executions from 1976 to 2006;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of individuals executed in Texas]]&lt;/ref&gt; the second-highest ranking state is Virginia, with 98 executions.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of individuals executed in Virginia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the official policy of the [[European Union]] and a number of non-EU nations to achieve global abolition of the death penalty.

Some opponents criticize the over-representation of blacks on death row as evidence of the unequal racial application of the death penalty.

Other non-violent offenses which carry extremely long prison sentences in the United States include [[fraud]] and other acts of corruption, offenses relating to [[child pornography]], and [[contempt of court]].

The number of foreign nationals in US prisons has skyrocketed in recent decades. The US Justice Department rarely approves of foreign prisoners' extradition to their home countries, and most are deported after serving their sentences instead of before their trials. This is seen as a huge contributor to [[prison overcrowding]], especially in California, Arizona, and Texas. It is estimated that illegal immigrants from [[Mexico]] make up 40% of the prison population in those 3 states. This goes hand-in-hand with the US immigration policies, which have also been criticized by human rights groups.

The United States has also been widely criticized for its attitude towards [[parole]] and incarceration alternatives. There is no parole in the federal prison system, which has drawn international outrage from human rights groups and is believed to be a major contributor to prison overcrowding. In addition, 16 states have no parole in their prison systems. Parole is rarely granted where it is allowed, and the USA is the only country that currently has juveniles serving life sentences without parole. The USA has also been heavily criticized for having few or no [[alternatives to incarceration]]. [[Probation]], fines, and [[community service]] are extremely rarely issued instead of prison time. It is believed that money and profits are the main driving factors behind all this.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Sex offender registries===
{{main|Sex offender registries in the United States}}
[[Human Rights Watch]] has twice said that there are human right issues created by the current [[Sex offender registries in the United States|sex offender registry]] laws, and that they believe that what they call the burden of being publicly listed as a [[sex offender]], combined with what they call "onerous restrictions placed on former offenders and their family members" are serious human rights issues. They have criticized what they call over-breadth of the registration requirement which tends to treat all offenders the same regardless of the nature of the offense and without accounting the risk of future re-offending, and the application of such laws to juvenile offenders, consensual teenage sex, prostitution and exposing one self as prank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pittman|first1=Nicole|last2=Parker|first2=Alison|title=Raised on the registry : the irreparable harm of placing children on sex offender registries in the US|date=2013|publisher=Human Rights Watch|location=New York|isbn=978-1-62313-0084|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2013/05/01/raised-registry-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Easy Answers - Sex Offender Laws in the US|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/09/11/no-easy-answers-0|publisher=Human Rights Watch|date=September 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ACLU&lt;ref name=aclu&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hegeman|first1=Roxana|title=ACLU says offender registry unconstitutional Registry includes sex offenders, people convicted of certain violent crimes|url=http://cjonline.com/news/2014-08-12/aclu-says-offender-registry-unconstitutional|work=The Topeka Capital- Journal|date=August 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reformist group [[RSOL]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Long|first1=Matt|title=Group calls for moratorium on sex offender registry after killings|url=http://www.southcarolinaradionetwork.com/2013/07/29/group-calls-for-moratorium-on-sex-offender-registry-after-killings/|work=South Carolina Radio Network|date=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zakalik|first1=Lauren|title=National conference aims to soften, reform sex offender laws|url=http://www.koat.com/news/new-mexico/albuquerque/National-conference-aims-to-soften-reform-sex-offender-laws/16402040|accessdate=November 14, 2014|work=KOAT|date=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lovett|first1=Ian|title=Restricted Group Speaks Up, Saying Sex Crime Measures Go Too Far|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/us/restricted-group-speaks-up-saying-sex-crime-measures-go-too-far.html|accessdate=November 14, 2014|work=The New York Times|date= October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have joined the critique saying that measures against sex offenders go too far and that current legislation is breaking constitutional rights of former offenders.

===Police brutality===
{{main|Police brutality in the United States}}
In a 1999 report, [[Amnesty International]] said it had "documented patterns of ill-treatment across the U.S., including police beatings, unjustified shootings and the use of dangerous restraint techniques."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/document.php?id=133746465C2D34CA8025690000692D98 |title=Race, Rights and Police Brutality |year=1999 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] USA |accessdate=December 22, 2007 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a 1998 Human Rights Watch report, incidents of police use of excessive force had occurred in cities throughout the U.S., and this behavior goes largely unchecked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/1998/07/07/usdom1224.htm |title=Report Charges Police Abuse in U.S. Goes Unchecked |date=July 7, 1998 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]

Abuse of prisoners is considered a crime in the United States [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]].

In 2004, photos showing humiliation and abuse of prisoners were leaked from [[Abu Ghraib prison]], causing a political and media scandal in the US. Forced humiliation of the detainees included, but is not limited to nudity, rape, human piling of nude detainees, masturbation, eating food out of toilets, crawling on hand and knees while American soldiers were sitting on their back sometimes requiring them to bark like dogs, and hooking up electrical wires to fingers, toes, and penises.&lt;ref name=AbuGhraibAbuse&gt;{{Cite news|last=Higham|first=Scott|author2=Stephens, Joe|page=A01|date=May 21, 2004|accessdate=June 23, 2007|title=New Details of Prison Abuse Emerge|work=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43783-2004May20.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Ramcharan]], acting UN High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that while the removal of Saddam Hussein represented "a major contribution to human rights in Iraq" and that the United States had condemned the conduct at Abu Ghraib and pledged to bring violators to justice, "willful killing, torture and inhuman treatment" represented a grave breach of international law and "might be designated as war crimes by a competent tribunal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/intljustice/general/2004/0604crime.htm|title=UN Says Abu Ghraib Abuse Could Constitute War Crime|first=|last=Administrator|website=www.globalpolicy.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the acts of humiliation, there were more violent claims, such as American soldiers sodomizing detainees (including an event involving an underage boy), an incident where a phosphoric light was broken and the chemicals poured on a detainee, repeated beatings, and threats of death.&lt;ref name=AbuGhraibAbuse/&gt; Six military personnel were charged with prisoner abuse in the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal. The harshest sentence was handed out to [[Charles Graner]], who received a 10-year sentence to be served in a military prison and a demotion to private; the other offenders received lesser sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/popup?id=140764|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=May 28, 2007|title=Prisoner Abuse: The Accused}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their report ''The Road to Abu Ghraib'', [[Human Rights Watch]] describe how:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The severest abuses at Abu Ghraib occurred in the immediate aftermath of a decision by Secretary Rumsfeld to step up the hunt for "actionable intelligence" among Iraqi prisoners. The officer who oversaw intelligence gathering at Guantanamo was brought in to overhaul interrogation practices in Iraq, and teams of interrogators from Guantanamo were sent to Abu Ghraib. The commanding general in Iraq issued orders to "manipulate an internee's emotions and weaknesses." Military police were ordered by military intelligence to "set physical and mental conditions for favorable interrogation of witnesses." The captain who oversaw interrogations at the Afghan detention center where two prisoners died in detention posted "Interrogation Rules of Engagement" at Abu Ghraib, authorizing coercive methods (with prior written approval of the military commander) such as the use of military guard dogs to instill fear that violate the Geneva Conventions and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman Degrading Treatment or Punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/12123/section/2|title=The Road to Abu Ghraib -|date=June 8, 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The June 21, 2004, issue of ''[[Newsweek]]'' stated that the [[Bybee memo]], a 2002 legal memorandum drafted by former OLC lawyer [[John Yoo]] that described what sort of interrogation tactics against suspected terrorists or terrorist affiliates the Bush administration would consider legal, was "...&amp;nbsp;prompted by CIA questions about what to do with a top Qaeda captive, [[Abu Zubaydah]], who had turned uncooperative&amp;nbsp;... and was drafted after White House meetings convened by George W. Bush's chief counsel, [[Alberto Gonzales]], along with Defense Department general counsel [[William J. Haynes, II|William Haynes]] and [[David Addington]], Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]'s counsel, who discussed specific interrogation techniques," citing "a source familiar with the discussions." Amongst the methods they found acceptable was waterboarding.&lt;ref name='Newsweek WB_062104'&gt;{{Cite news| first=Michael | last=Hirsh |author2=John Barry |author3=Daniel Klaidman  | title=A tortured debate: amid feuding and turf battles, lawyers in the White House discussed specific terror-interrogation techniques like 'water-boarding' and 'mock-burials' | date=June 21, 2004 | work=Newsweek | url =http://www.newsweek.com/id/54093/page/1 | accessdate = December 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, [[ABC News]] reported that former CIA agents claimed that the CIA engaged in a modern form of waterboarding, along with five other "[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]", against suspected members of [[al Qaeda]].

[[UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]], [[Louise Arbour]], stated on the subject of waterboarding "I would have no problems with describing this practice as falling under the prohibition of torture," and that violators of the UN [[Convention Against Torture]] should be prosecuted under the principle of [[universal jurisdiction]].&lt;ref name="Louise Arbour"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=96287 |title=Waterboarding qualifies as torture: UN |accessdate=February 24, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429055909/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=96287 |archivedate=April 29, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bent Sørensen, Senior Medical Consultant to the [[International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims]] and former member of the United Nations [[United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture|Committee Against Torture]] has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It's a clear-cut case: Waterboarding can without any reservation be labeled as torture. It fulfils all of the four central criteria that according to the United Nations Convention Against Torture (UNCAT) defines an act of torture. First, when water is forced into your lungs in this fashion, in addition to the pain you are likely to experience an immediate and extreme fear of death. You may even suffer a heart attack from the stress or damage to the lungs and brain from inhalation of water and oxygen deprivation. In other words there is no doubt that waterboarding causes severe physical and/or mental suffering – one central element in the UNCAT's definition of torture. In addition the CIA's waterboarding clearly fulfills the three additional definition criteria stated in the Convention for a deed to be labeled torture, since it is 1) done intentionally, 2) for a specific purpose and 3) by a representative of a state – in this case the US.&lt;ref name="Bent Sørensen"&gt;Bent Sørensen on waterboarding as torture

Both [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]] have condemned waterboarding as a form of torture, the latter group demanding that former president [[George W. Bush]] be prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Maddy Sauer |author2=Vic Walter |author3=Rich Esposito | url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1356870| title=History of an Interrogation Technique: Water Boarding| publisher=ABC News| accessdate=September 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/11/10/us-usa-bush-amnesty-idUSTRE6A957O20101110| title=Amnesty: prosecute Bush for admitted waterboarding| publisher=Reuters| date=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lt. Gen. [[Michael D. Maples]], the director of the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], concurred by stating, in a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, that he believes waterboarding violates [[Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions]].&lt;ref name="Maples"&gt;Violating international law [http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/02/army_official_yes_waterboardin.php Army Official: Yes, Waterboarding Breaks International Law] By Paul Kiel, [[Talking Points Memo]], February 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal]] and [[United Nations War Crimes Commission]] both defined waterboarding as ill-treatment and torture in the aftermath of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/12/waterboarding-torture-japan-world-war-ii| author=Luke Whelan| title=New Documents Show the US Called Waterboarding Torture During World War II| publisher=Mother Jones| date=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBSN 1"&gt;CBS News [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/29/politics/main3554687.shtml "McCain: Japanese Hanged For Waterboarding"], CBS News, 29 November 2007. Retrieved 9 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA director testified that waterboarding has not been used since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2008-02-06-waterboarding_N.htm White House defends waterboarding; CIA chief uncertain], Associated Press, February 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, the [[Obama administration]] released four memos in which government lawyers from the Bush administration approved tough interrogation methods used against 28 terror suspects. The rough tactics range from [[waterboarding]] (simulated drowning) to keeping suspects naked and denying them solid food.&lt;ref name="waterboarding1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtop.com/?nid=116&amp;pid=0&amp;sid=1651572&amp;page=1|title=WTOP: Washington, DC's Top News, Traffic, &amp; Weather - Washington's Top News|website=WTOP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These memos were accompanied by the Justice Department's release of four Bush-era legal opinions covering (in graphic and extensive detail) the interrogation of 14 high-value terror detainees using harsh techniques beyond [[waterboarding]]. These additional techniques include keeping detainees in a painful standing position for long periods (Used often, once for 180 hours),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8006597.stm|title=CIA torture exemption 'illegal'|date=April 19, 2009|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a plastic neck collar to slam detainees into walls, keeping the detainee's cell cold for long periods, beating and kicking the detainee, [[insects]] placed in a confinement box (the suspect had a fear of [[insects]]), sleep-deprivation, prolonged shackling, and threats to a detainee's family. One of the memos also authorized a method for combining multiple techniques.&lt;ref name="waterboarding1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/16/torture-memos-bush-administration|title=Barack Obama releases Bush administration torture memos|first=Ewen|last=MacAskill|date=April 16, 2009|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Details from the memos also included the number of times that techniques such as [[waterboarding]] were used. A footnote said that one detainee was waterboarded 83 times in one month, while another was waterboarded 183 times in a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://documents.nytimes.com/justice-department-memos-on-interrogation-techniques#p=121|title=Justice Department Memos on Interrogation Techniques |accessdate=April 30, 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Guantánamo Bay====
The United States maintains a detention center at its military base at [[Guantánamo Bay]], Cuba where [[enemy combatants]] of the war on terror are held. The detention center has been the source of various controversies regarding the legality of the center and the treatment of detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=One rule for them| first=George| last=Monbiot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guantanamo1"&gt;''In re Guantanamo Detainee Cases'', 355 F.Supp.2d 443 (D.D.C. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] has called the situation "a human rights scandal" in a series of reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://web.amnesty.org/pages/guantanamobay-index-eng| publisher=Amnesty International| title=Guantánamo Bay - a human rights scandal| accessdate = March 15, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060206065717/http://web.amnesty.org/pages/guantanamobay-index-eng &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = February 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 775 detainees have been brought to Guantánamo. Of these, many have been released without charge. {{RemainingAtGuantanamo}} The United States assumed territorial control over Guantánamo Bay under the 1903 [[Cuban–American Treaty of Relations (1903)|Cuban–American Treaty of Relations]], which granted the United States a perpetual lease of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/dip_cuba002.asp|title=Avalon Project - Agreement Between the United States and Cuba for the Lease of Lands for Coaling and Naval stations; February 23, 1903|website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States, by virtue of its complete jurisdiction and control, maintains "de facto" sovereignty over this territory, while Cuba retained ultimate sovereignty over the territory. The current government of Cuba regards the U.S. presence in Guantánamo as illegal and insists the Cuban-American Treaty was obtained by threat of force in violation of international law.&lt;ref&gt;De Zayas, Alfred. (2003.)

A delegation of [[UN Special Rapporteur]]s to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] claimed that interrogation techniques used in the detention center amount to degrading treatment in violation of the ICCPR and the [[Convention Against Torture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G06/112/76/PDF/G0611276.pdf?OpenElement ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS Situation of detainees at Guantánamo Bay Report of the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Leila Zerrougui; the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Leandro Despouy; the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, Manfred Nowak; the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Asma Jahangir; and the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Paul Hunt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225151333/http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G06/112/76/PDF/G0611276.pdf?OpenElement |date=February 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Amnesty International]] expressed alarm at the erosion in civil liberties since the 9/11 attacks. According to Amnesty International:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Guantánamo Bay detention camp has become a symbol of the United States administration's refusal to put human rights and the rule of law at the heart of its response to the atrocities of September 11, 2001. It has become synonymous with the United States executive's pursuit of unfettered power, and has become firmly associated with the systematic denial of human dignity and resort to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment that has marked the U.S.'s detentions and interrogations in the "war on terror".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr51/063/2005/en/|title=Guantánamo and beyond: The continuing pursuit of unchecked executive power|publisher=Amnesty International|date=May 13, 2005|accessdate=May 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Amnesty International also condemned the Guantánamo facility as "...&amp;nbsp;the [[gulag]] of our times," which raised heated conversation in the United States. The purported legal status of "''unlawful combatants''" in those nations currently holding detainees under that name has been the subject of criticism by other nations and international human rights institutions including Human Rights Watch and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]. The ICRC, in response to the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan, published a paper on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/Web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/5LPHBV/%24File/irrc_849_Dorman.pdf The legal situation of unlawful/unprivileged combatants (IRRC March 2003 Vol.85 No 849)].

However, former [[US Republican Party|Republican]] governor [[Mike Huckabee]], for example, has stated that the conditions in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantánamo]] are better than most U.S. prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,280457,00.html |title=Huckabee Says Guantanamo Bay Offers Better Conditions to Detainees Than Most U.S. Prisons - You Decide 2008 |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=June 11, 2007 |accessdate=May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. government argues that even if detainees were entitled to POW status, they would not have the right to lawyers, access to the courts to challenge their detention, or the opportunity to be released prior to the end of hostilities—and that nothing in the [[Third Geneva Convention]] provides POWs such rights, and POWs in past wars—such as [[Japanese prisoners of war in World War II]]—have generally not been given these rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul2007/Legal%20basis%20Guantanamo%20Detainees%20OGC%20FINAL.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[White House]]|accessdate=November 17, 2007|title=Guantanamo Detainees Info Sheet #1 – November 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Hamdan v.

====Extraordinary rendition====
{{See also|Extraordinary rendition by the United States}}

Foreign nationals are occasionally captured and [[Kidnapping|abducted]] outside of the United States and transferred to secret US administered detention facilities, sometimes being held incommunicado for periods of months or years, a process known as [[Extraordinary rendition by the United States|extraordinary rendition]].

According to ''[[The New Yorker]]'', "The most common destinations for rendered suspects are [[Egypt]], [[Morocco]], [[Syria]], and Jordan, all of which have been cited for human-rights violations by the State Department, and are known to torture suspects."&lt;ref name=NewYorker&gt;{{Cite news|first=Jane|last=Mayer|date=February 14, 2005|accessdate=May 29, 2007|title=Outsourcing Torture|work=[[The New Yorker]]|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/02/14/050214fa_fact6?currentPage=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Notable cases=====
In November 2001, [[Yaser Esam Hamdi]], a U.S. citizen, was captured by [[Afghan Northern Alliance]] forces in [[Konduz]], [[Afghanistan]], amongst hundreds of surrendering [[Taliban]] fighters and was transferred into U.S. custody. The U.S. government alleged that Hamdi was there fighting for the Taliban, while Hamdi, through his father, has claimed that he was merely there as a relief worker and was mistakenly captured. Hamdi was transferred into CIA custody and transferred to the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]], but when it was discovered that he was a U.S. citizen, he was transferred to naval brig in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Virginia]] and then he was transferred brig in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]]. The [[George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] identified him as an [[unlawful combatant]] and denied him access to an attorney or the court system, despite his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right to [[due process]]. In 2002 Hamdi's father filed a ''[[habeas corpus]]'' petition, the Judge ruled in Hamdi's favor and required he be allowed a public defender; however, on appeal the decision was reversed. In 2004, in the case of ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]'' the U.S. Supreme court reversed the dismissal of a ''habeas corpus'' petition and ruled detainees who are U.S. citizens must have the ability to challenge their detention before an impartial judge.

In December 2004, [[Khalid El-Masri]], a [[Germany|German]] citizen, was apprehended by [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] authorities when traveling to [[Skopje]] because his name was similar to [[Khalid al-Masri]], an alleged mentor to the al-Qaeda [[Hamburg cell]]. After being held in a motel in Macedonia for over three weeks he was transferred to the CIA and [[Extraordinary rendition by the United States|extradited]] to Afghanistan. While held in Afghanistan, El-Masri claims he was sodomized, beaten, and repeatedly interrogated about alleged terrorist ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/18/AR2006051802107.html|title=Lawsuit Against CIA is Dismissed|first=Jerry|last=Markon|date=May 19, 2006|accessdate=May 29, 2007|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being in custody for five months, [[Condoleezza Rice]] learned of his detention and ordered his release. El-Masri was released at night on a desolate road in [[Albania]], without apology or funds to return home. He was intercepted by Albanian guards, who believed he was a terrorist due to his haggard and unkept appearance. He was subsequently reunited with his wife who had returned to her family in [[Lebanon]] with their children because she thought her husband had abandoned them. Using [[isotope analysis]], scientists at the Bavarian archive for [[geology]] in [[Munich]] analyzed his hair and verified that he was malnourished during his disappearance.&lt;ref name="derspiegel050214"&gt;Georg Mascolo, Holger Stark: ''[http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/spiegel/0,1518,341636,00.html The US Stands Accused of Kidnapping]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''.

According to the [[Human Rights Watch]] report (September 2012) the United States government during the U.S. President Bush republican administration "waterboarding" [[torture]]d opponents of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] during interrogations, then transferred them to mistreatment in [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/09/05/us-torture-and-rendition-gaddafi-s-libya US: Torture and Rendition to Gaddafi's Libya [[Human Rights Watch]] ] September 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/libya0912webwcover_1.pdf Delivered Into Enemy Hands US-Led Abuse and Rendition of Opponents to Gaddafi's Libya] [[Human Rights Watch]] 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

He persuaded the Government of Mauritania to re-open voter registration lists to an additional 85,000 citizens, which includes a significant number of Afro-Mauritanian minority individuals. He also organized and managed the largest youth-focused democracy project in Mauritania in 5 years.
*Nathaniel Jensen of the embassy in Vietnam was runner-up. He successfully advanced the human rights agenda on several fronts, including organizing the resumption of a bilateral Human Rights Dialogue, pushing for the release of Vietnam's prisoners of concern, and dedicating himself to improving religion freedom in northern Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/|title=2006 Human Rights and Democracy Achievement Award|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]: Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|accessdate=June 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under legislation by congress, the United States declared that countries utilizing child soldiers may no longer be eligible for US military assistance, in an attempt to end this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author1=Jo Becker |author2=children's rights advocate |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/12/11/us-limits-military-aid-nations-using-child-soldiers |title=US Limits Military Aid to Nations Using Child Soldiers &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=December 11, 2008 |accessdate=May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Bill of Rights===
:''See also [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights#United States|International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights - United States]]''

The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR) are the legal treaties that enshrine the rights outlined in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. Together, and along with the [[First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|first]] and [[First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|second]] optional protocols of the [[ICCPR]] they constitute the [[International bill of rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/|title=OHCHR International law|publisher=OHCHR|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu6/2/fs2.htm|title=unhchr.ch|website=www.unhchr.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US has not ratified the [[ICESCR]] or either of the optional protocols of the [[ICCPR]].

The US's ratification of the [[ICCPR]] was done with five [[Reservation (law)|reservations]] – or limits – on the treaty, 5 understandings and 4 declarations. Among these is the rejection of sections of the treaty that prohibit [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/ratification/docs/DeclarationsReservationsICCPR.pdf OHCHR Reservations and declarations on ratificatons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528125237/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/ratification/docs/DeclarationsReservationsICCPR.pdf |date=May 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/1893-cn.htm America'S Problem With Human Rights&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015051238/http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/1893-cn.htm |date=October 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Included in the Senate's ratification was the declaration that "the provisions of Article 1 through 27 of the Covenant are not self-executing",&lt;ref&gt;138 Cong. Rec. S4781-84 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; and in a Senate Executive Report stated that the declaration was meant to "clarify that the Covenant will not create a private cause of action in U.S. Courts."&lt;ref&gt;S. Exec. Rep. No. 102-23 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; This way of ratifying the treaty was criticized as incompatible with the Supremacy Clause by [[Louis Henkin]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis Henkin, U.S. Ratification of Human Rights Treaties: The Ghost of Senator Bricker, 89 Am. J. Int'l L. 341, 346 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reservation that is "incompatible with the object and purpose" of a treaty is void as a matter of international law, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, art. 19, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331 (entered into force January 27, 1980) (specifying conditions under which signatory States can offer "reservations"), there is some issue as to whether the non-self-execution declaration is even legal under domestic law. At any rate, the United States is but a signatory in name only.

===International Criminal Court===
{{Further|United States and the International Criminal Court}}

The U.S. has not ratified the [[Rome Statute]] of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), which was drafted for prosecuting individuals above the authority of national courts in the event of accusations of [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]], and [[crime of aggression]]. Nations that have accepted the Rome Statute can defer to the jurisdiction of the ICC or must surrender their jurisdiction when ordered.

The US rejected the Rome Statute after its attempts to include the nation of origin as a party in international proceedings failed, and after certain requests were not met, including recognition of gender issues, "rigorous" qualifications for judges, viable definitions of crimes, protection of national security information that might be sought by the court, and jurisdiction of the UN Security Council to halt court proceedings in special cases.&lt;ref name="US objections to RS"/&gt; Since the passage of the statute, the US has actively encouraged nations around the world to sign "bilateral immunity agreements" prohibiting the surrender of US personnel before the ICC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccnow.org/?mod=bia|title=Coalition for the International Criminal Court - Global justice for atrocities|website=www.iccnow.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and actively attempted to undermine the [[Rome Statute]] of the [[International Criminal Court]].&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/campaigns/icc/us.htm|title=HRW: ICC: The U.S. and the ICC|website=www.hrw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Congress also passed a law, [[American Service-Members' Protection Act]] (ASPA) authorizing the use of military force to free any US personnel that are brought before the court rather than its own court system.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, "[https://www.hrw.org/press/2002/08/aspa080302.htm U.S.: 'Hague Invasion Act' Becomes Law]." August 3, 2002. Retrieved January 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Sutherland, "[https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4456801,00.html Who are America's real enemies?]" ''The Guardian'', July 8, 2002. Retrieved January 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch criticized the United States for removing itself from the Statute.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1970312.stm|title=US renounces world court treaty|date=May 6, 2002|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge [[Richard Goldstone]], the first chief prosecutor at [[ICTY|The Hague war crimes tribunal on the former Yugoslavia]], echoed these sentiments saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I think it is a very backwards step. It is unprecedented which I think to an extent smacks of pettiness in the sense that it is not going to affect in any way the establishment of the international criminal court&amp;nbsp;... The US have really isolated themselves and are putting themselves into bed with the likes of China, the Yemen and other undemocratic countries.&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the US has maintained that it will "bring to justice those who commit genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes," its primary objections to the Rome Statute have revolved around the issues of jurisdiction and process. A US ambassador for War Crimes Issues to the UN Security Council said to the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee that because the Rome Statute requires only one nation to submit to the ICC, and that this nation can be the country in which an alleged crime was committed rather than defendant's country of origin, U.S. military personnel and US foreign peaceworkers in more than 100 countries could be tried in international court without the consent of the US. The ambassador states that "most atrocities are committed internally and most internal conflicts are between warring parties of the same nationality, the worst offenders of international humanitarian law can choose never to join the treaty and be fully insulated from its reach absent a Security Council referral. Yet multinational peacekeeping forces operating in a country that has joined the treaty can be exposed to the court's jurisdiction even if the country of the individual peacekeeper has not joined the treaty."&lt;ref name="US objections to RS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/www/policy_remarks/1998/980723_scheffer_icc.html|title=98/07/23 Amb.

===Other treaties not signed or signed but not ratified===
Where the signature is subject to ratification, acceptance or approval, the signature does not establish the consent to be bound. However, it is a means of authentication and expresses the willingness of the signatory state to continue the treaty-making process. The signature qualifies the signatory state to proceed to ratification, acceptance or approval. It also creates an obligation to refrain, in good faith, from acts that would defeat the object and the purpose of the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties between States and International Organizations or between International Organizations 1986 Article 18.

===Coverage of violations in the media===
Studies have found that the ''New York Times'' coverage of worldwide human rights violations is seriously biased, predominantly focusing on the human rights violations in nations where there is clear U.S. involvement, while having relatively little coverage of the human rights violations in other nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Harvard International Journal of Press|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/harvard_international_journal_of_press_politics/v004/4.4caliendo.html|title=All the News That's Fit to Print?

==Further assessments==
According to ''[[Freedom in the World]]'', an annual report by US based think-tank [[Freedom House]], which rates political rights and civil liberties, in 2007, the United States was ranked "Free" (the highest possible rating), together with 92 other countries.

The [[Polity data series]], which rate regime and authority characteristics, covering the years 1800-2004, has ranked the United States with the highest possible rating since 1871.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/polity/data/ Polity IV data sets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519095455/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/polity/data/ |date=May 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Economist Magazine]]'''s [[Democracy Index]] (2016), the US ranks 21 out of 167 nations.   In 2016 and 2017, the United States is classified as a "Flawed Democracy" by [[Democracy Index]] and received a score of 8.24 out of 10.00 with respect to civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-02-17|title=Democracy Index|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Democracy_Index&amp;oldid=826132468|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/topic/democracy-index|title=Democracy Index 2017|website=www.eiu.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first time the United States has been downgraded from a "Full Democracy" to a "Flawed Democracy" since The Economist began publishing the Democracy Index report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://infographics.economist.com/2018/DemocracyIndex/|title=EIU Democracy Index 2017|website=infographics.economist.com|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/26/america-is-no-longer-a-full-democracy-a-new-study-warns/|title=The U.S. is no longer a 'full democracy,' a new study warns|last=Erickson|first=Amanda|date=2017-01-26|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-02-17|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other issues==
In the aftermath of the devastation caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]], criticism by some groups commenting on human rights issues was made regarding the recovery and reconstruction issues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Klapper | first = Bradley | title = U.N. Panel Takes U.S. to Task Over Katrin | agency = Associated Press |work = The America's Intelligence Wire | date = July 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;26. The Committee, while taking note of the various rules and regulations prohibiting discrimination in the provision of disaster relief and emergency assistance, remains concerned about information that poor people and in particular African-Americans, were disadvantaged by the rescue and evacuation plans implemented when Hurricane Katrina hit the United States of America, and continue to be disadvantaged under the reconstruction plans. (articles 6 and 26) The State party should review its practices and policies to ensure the full implementation of its obligation to protect life and of the prohibition of discrimination, whether direct or indirect, as well as of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, in the areas of disaster prevention and preparedness, emergency assistance and relief measures. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, it should increase its efforts to ensure that the rights of poor people and in particular African-Americans, are fully taken into consideration in the reconstruction plans with regard to access to housing, education and health care. The Committee wishes to be informed about the results of the inquiries into the alleged failure to evacuate prisoners at the Parish prison, as well as the allegations that New Orleans residents were not permitted by law enforcement officials to cross the Greater New Orleans Bridge to Gretna, Louisiana.

'''Import substitution industrialization''' ('''ISI''') is a [[trade]] and [[economics|economic]] [[policy]] which advocates replacing foreign imports with domestic production.&lt;ref name="A Comprehensive Dictionary of Economics p.88"&gt;''A Comprehensive Dictionary of Economics'' p.88, ed. Nelson Brian 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  ISI is based on the premise that a country should attempt to reduce its foreign dependency through the local production of [[industrialized]] products. The term primarily refers to 20th-century [[development economics]] policies, although it has been advocated since the 18th century by [[economists]] such as [[Friedrich List]]&lt;ref name="Westernizing the Third World : The Eurocentricity of Economic Development. pp.33-57."&gt;Mehmet, Ozay (1999). ''Westernizing the Third World: The Eurocentricity of Economic Development.'' London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexander Hamilton]].&lt;ref name="Kicking Away the Ladder: Development Strategy in Historical Perspective" &gt;Chang, Ha-Joon (2002). ''Kicking Away the Ladder: Development Strategy in Historical Perspective.'' London: Anthem Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

ISI policies were enacted by countries in the Global South with the intention of producing development and self-sufficiency through the creation of an internal market. ISI works by having the state lead economic development through nationalization, subsidization of vital industries (agriculture, power generation, etc.), increased taxation, and highly protectionist trade policies.&lt;ref name="Structuralism, and Dependency in Latin America"&gt;Street, James H.; James, Dilmus D. (1982). "Structuralism, and Dependency in Latin America." ''Journal of Economic Issues'', 16(3) p. 673-689.&lt;/ref&gt; Import substitution industrialization was gradually abandoned by developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s due to the insistence of the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[World Bank]] on their [[structural adjustment]] programs of global market-driven liberalization aimed at the Global South.{{clarify|reason=humongous sentence|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref name="The Best of Times and the Worst of Times: Structural Adjustment Programs and Uneven Development in Africa: The Case of Ghana"&gt;Konadu-Agyemang, Kwadwo (2000).

In the context of Latin American development, the term "Latin American structuralism" refers to the era of import substitution industrialization in many Latin American countries from the 1950s until the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of ECLAC|url=http://www.cepal.org/en/history-eclac|website=Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theories behind Latin American structuralism and ISI were organized in the works of [[Raúl Prebisch]], [[Hans Singer]], [[Celso Furtado]], and other [[structuralist economics|structural economic]] thinkers, and gained prominence with the creation of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]] ([[UNECLAC]] or [[CEPAL]]). While the theorists behind ISI or Latin American structuralism were not homogeneous and did not belong to one particular school of economic thought, ISI and Latin American structuralism and the theorists who developed its economic framework shared a basic common belief in a state-directed, centrally planned form of economic development.&lt;ref name="Latin American structuralism and exogenous factors"&gt;Renato, Aguilar (1986). "Latin American structuralism and exogenous factors."''Social Science Information'', 25(1) p. 227-290.&lt;/ref&gt; In promoting state-induced industrialization through governmental spending through the [[infant industry argument]], ISI and Latin American structuralist approaches to development are largely influenced by a wide range of [[Keynesian]], [[communitarian]], and [[socialist]] economic thought.&lt;ref name="The Origins of Structuralism"&gt;Arndt, H.W. (1985). "The Origins of Structuralism."''World Development'', 13(2) p. 151-159.&lt;/ref&gt; ISI is often associated and linked with [[dependency theory]], although the latter has traditionally adopted a much broader Marxist sociological framework in addressing what are perceived to be the origins of [[underdevelopment]] through the historical effects of [[colonialism]], [[Eurocentrism]], and [[neoliberalism]].&lt;ref name="Geographies of neoliberalism in Latin America"&gt;Perreault, Thomas; Martin, Patricia (2005).

Even though ISI is a development theory, its political implementation and theoretical rationale are rooted in [[trade theory]]: it has been argued that all or virtually all nations that have industrialized have followed ISI. Import substitution was heavily practiced during the mid-20th century as a form of developmental theory that advocated increased productivity and economic gains within a country. This was an inward-looking economic theory practiced by developing nations after WW2. Many economists at the time considered the ISI approach as a remedy to mass poverty: bringing a third-world country to first-world status through national industrialization. Mass poverty is defined thusly: "the dominance of agricultural and mineral activities – in the low-income countries, and in their inability, because of their structure, to profit from international trade," (Bruton 905).

[[Mercantilist]] economic theory and practices of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries frequently advocated building up domestic manufacturing and import substitution. In the early United States, the [[Hamiltonian economic program]], specifically the third report and the ''magnum opus'' of [[Alexander Hamilton]], the ''[[Report on Manufactures]]'', advocated for the U.S. to become self-sufficient in manufactured goods. This formed the basis of the [[American School (economics)|American School in economics]], which was an influential force in the United States during its 19th-century industrialization.

[[Werner Baer]] contends that all countries that have industrialized after the United Kingdom went through a stage of ISI, in which the large part of investment in industry was directed to replace imports (Baer, pp.&amp;nbsp;95–96).&lt;ref&gt;Baer, Werner (1972), "Import Substitution and Industrialization in Latin America: Experiences and Interpretations", Latin American Research Review vol. 7 (Spring): 95–122.(1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Going farther, in his book ''Kicking Away the Ladder'', Korean economist [[Ha-Joon Chang]] also argues, based on economic history, that all major developed countries, including the United Kingdom, used interventionist economic policies to promote industrialization and protected national companies until they had reached a level of development in which they were able to compete in the global market, after which those countries adopted free market discourses directed at other countries to obtain two objectives: open their markets to local products and prevent them from adopting the same development strategies that led to the developed nations' industrialization.

== Theoretical basis ==
As a set of development policies, ISI policies are theoretically grounded on the [[Singer-Prebisch thesis]], on the [[infant industry]] argument, and on [[Keynesian]] economics. From these postulates, it derives a body of practices, which are commonly: an active industrial policy to subsidize and orchestrate production of strategic substitutes, protective barriers to trade (such as [[tariff]]s), an overvalued currency to help manufacturers import capital goods (heavy machinery), and discouragement of [[foreign direct investment]].

By placing high tariffs on imports and other protectionist, inward-looking trade policies, the citizens of any given country, using a simple supply-and-demand rationale, will substitute the less-expensive good for the more expensive. The primary industry of importance would gather its resources, such as labor from other industries in this situation; the industrial sector would use resources, capital, and labor from the agricultural sector. In time, a third-world country would look and behave similar to a first-world country, and with a new accumulation of capital and an increase of TFP ([[total factor productivity]]) the nation's industry would, in principle, be capable of trading internationally and competing in the world market. Bishwanath Goldar, in his paper ‘Import Substitution, Industrial Concentration and Productivity Growth in Indian Manufacturing’ wrote: "Earlier studies on productivity for the industrial sector of developing countries have indicated that increases in total factor productivity, (TFP) are an important source of industrial growth," (Goldar 143). He continued: "a higher growth rate in output, other things remaining the same, would enable the industry to attain a higher rate of technological progress (since more investment would be made) and create a situation in which the constituent firms could take greater advantage of scale economies;" it is believed that ISI will allow this (Goldar 148).

In many cases, however, these assertions did not apply. On several occasions, the Brazilian ISI process, which occurred from 1930 until the end of the 1980s, involved currency devaluation as a means of boosting exports and discouraging imports (thus promoting the consumption of locally manufactured products), as well as the adoption of different exchange rates for importing capital goods and for importing consumer goods. Moreover, government policies toward investment were not always opposed to foreign capital: the Brazilian industrialization process was based on a tripod which involved governmental, private, and foreign capital, the first being directed to infrastructure and heavy industry, the second to manufacturing consumer goods, and the third, to the production of durable goods (such as automobiles). Volkswagen, Ford, GM, and Mercedes all established production facilities in Brazil in the 1950s and 1960s.

The principal concept underlying ISI can thus be described as an attempt to reduce foreign dependency of a country's economy through local production of industrialized products, whether through national or foreign investment, for domestic or foreign consumption. It should be noted, as well, that import substitution does not mean ''import elimination'': as a country industrializes, it begins to import new materials that become necessary for its industries, such as petroleum, chemicals, and other raw materials it may have formerly lacked.

===Local ownership import substituting===
In 2006, Michael Shuman proposed '''Local ownership import substituting''' (LOIS), as an alternative to [[neoliberalism]]. It rejects the idelogy of [[there is no alternative]].&lt;ref&gt;Shuman, M. H. (2006). ''The small-mart revolution: how local businesses are beating the global competition''. San Francisco, CA: Berrett-Koehler.&lt;/ref&gt; Shuman claims LOIS businesses are long term [[wealth]] generators, are less likely to [[exit strategy|exit]] destructively and have higher [[multiplier (economics)|economic multipliers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/culture/cage-match-tina-vs-lois.html|title=Cage Match: TINA vs LOIS|author=|date=|website=treehugger.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Latin America ==

Import substitution policies were adopted by most nations in Latin America from the 1930s until the late 1980s. The initial date is largely attributed to the impact of the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, when Latin American countries, which exported primary products and imported almost all of the industrialized goods they consumed, were prevented from importing due to a sharp decline in their foreign sales. This served as an incentive for the domestic production of the goods they needed.

The first steps in import substitution were less theoretical and more pragmatic choices on how to face the limitations imposed by recession, even though the governments in Argentina ([[Juan Domingo Perón]]) and Brazil ([[Getúlio Vargas]]) had the precedent of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] (and, to some extent, the Soviet Union) as inspirations of state-induced industrialization. [[Positivist]] thinking, which sought a "strong government" to "modernize" society, played a major influence on Latin American military thinking in the 20th century. Among the officials, many of whom rose to power, like Perón and Vargas, industrialization (especially steel production) was synonymous with "progress" and was naturally placed as a priority.

ISI gained a theoretical foundation only in the 1950s, when [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[economist]] and [[UNECLAC]] head [[Raúl Prebisch]] was a visible proponent of the idea, as well as Brazilian economist [[Celso Furtado]]. Prebisch had experience running his country’s central bank and started to question the model of export-led growth.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/907585907|title=The world transformed : 1945 to the present|last=H.|first=Hunt, Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780199371020|location=|pages=227|oclc=907585907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prebisch came to the conclusion that the participants in the free-trade regime had unequal power, and that the central economies (particularly Britain and the United States) that manufactured industrial goods could control the price of their exports.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; These unequal powers were taking the wealth from third world countries leaving them with no way to prosper.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=The World Transformed |last=Hunt |first=Michael |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-19-937102-0 |location=New York |pages=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that [[developing countries]] needed to create local [https://web.archive.org/web/20120225002524/http://apps.develebridge.net/amap/index.php/Vertical_Linkages vertical linkages], and they could only succeed by creating industries that used the primary products already being produced domestically. The [[tariff]]s were designed to allow domestic [[Infant industry argument|infant industries]] to prosper. In doing so Prebisch’s predicted many benefits, the dependence for imports will lower and they will not be forced to sell agricultural goods for low prices to pay for industrial goods the income rate would go up, and the country itself would have a strong growth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

ISI was most successful in countries with large populations and income levels which allowed for the consumption of locally produced products. Latin American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and (to a lesser extent) [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Venezuela]], had the most success with ISI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Blouet | first =Olwyn | authorlink = |author2=Olwyn Blouet |author3=Brian W.

&lt;/ref&gt; This is because while the investment to produce cheap consumer products may be profitable in small markets, the same cannot be said for capital-intensive industries, such as automobiles and heavy machinery, which depend on larger markets to survive. Thus, smaller and poorer countries, such as [[Ecuador]], [[Honduras]], and the [[Dominican Republic]], could implement ISI only to a limited extent. [[Peru]] implemented ISI in 1961, and the policy lasted through to the end of the decade in some form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/peru.htm|title=ECONOMIC HISTORY AND THE ECONOMY OF PERU|author=|date=|website=www.sjsu.edu|accessdate=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To overcome the difficulties of implementing ISI in small-scale economies, proponents of this economic policy, some within [[UNECLAC]], suggested two alternatives to enlarge consumer markets: income redistribution within each country, through agrarian reform and other initiatives aimed at bringing Latin America's enormous marginalized population into the consumer market, and [[regional integration]] through initiatives such as the [[Latin American Free Trade Association]] (ALALC), which would allow for the products of one country to be sold in another.

In Latin American countries in which ISI was most successful, it was accompanied by structural changes to the government. Old [[neocolonialism|neocolonial]] governments were replaced by more-or-less [[democratic government]]s. Banks and utilities and certain foreign-owned companies were [[nationalized]] or had their ownership transferred to local [[businessperson|businesspeople]].

Many economists contend that ISI failed in Latin America and was one of many factors leading to the so-called [[Latin American debt crisis|lost decade]] of Latin American economics, while others {{who|date=December 2011}} contend that ISI led to the "Mexican Miracle," the period from 1940 to 1975, in which annual economic growth stood at 6% or higher.

As noted by one historian, ISI was successful in fostering a great deal of social and economic development in Latin America:

“By the early 1960s, domestic industry supplied 95% of Mexico’s and 98% of Brazil’s consumer goods. Between 1950 and 1980, Latin America’s industrial output went up six times, keeping well ahead of population growth. Infant mortality fell from 107 per 1,000 live births in 1960 to 69 per 1,000 in 1980, [and] life expectancy rose from 52 to 64 years. In the mid-1950s, Latin America’s economies were growing faster than those of the industrialized West.”&lt;ref&gt;Globalization and the Postcolonial World: The New Political Economy of Development by Ankie Hoogevelt&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Advocates of neoliberal economics argue that while import substitution policies might create jobs in the short run, as domestic producers replace foreign producers, both output and growth will be lower than it would otherwise have been in the long run. Import substitution denies the country the benefits to be gained from specialisation and foreign imports. The theory of [[comparative advantage]] shows how countries will gain from trade. Moreover, protectionism leads to dynamic inefficiency, as domestic producers have no incentive from foreign competitors to reduce costs or improve products. Import substitution can impede growth through poor allocation of resources, and its effect on exchange rates harms exports.&lt;ref&gt;Import Substitution and Industrialization in Latin America: Experiences and Interpretations. Baer, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Results ===
Despite some apparent gains, import substitution was "both unsustainable over time and produced high economic and social costs."&lt;ref name="Franko, P. M. 2007"&gt;Franko, P. M. (2007). The puzzle of Latin American economic development (3rd ed.). Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;  Given import substitution's dependence upon its developed and isolated markets within Latin America, it relied upon the growth of a market that was limited in size. In most cases, the lack of experience in manufacturing and the lack of competition, reduced innovation and efficiency, which restrained the quality of Latin American produced goods, and protectionist policies kept prices high.&lt;ref name="Franko, P. M. 2007"/&gt; In addition, power was concentrated in the hands of a few, which decreased the incentive for entrepreneurial development.

Contrary to its intent, import substitution exacerbated inequality in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Lustig, Lustig, Luis Lopez-Calva and Eduardo Ortiz-Juarez, 2013, “[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2013/07/31/000158349_20130731085829/Rendered/PDF/WPS6552.pdf Deconstructing the Decline in Inequality in Latin America,]” World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No. 6552, Washington, July.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Failed verification|date=August 2017}} With a poverty rate greater than 30%, the internal demand that import substitution relied upon was not available.&lt;ref&gt;Eduardo Lora, 2012, "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2219778 Structural Reforms in Latin America: What Has Been Reformed and How to Measure It] (Updated version)" Inter-American Development Bank Working Paper #346, Washington, December.&lt;/ref&gt;  Protective policies and state ownership reduced the incentives for business risk, resulting in decreased efficiency.

Lastly, the large deficits and debts resulting from import substitution policies are largely credited for the resulting Latin American crisis of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Sachs (1985), "[http://www.earth.columbia.edu/sitefiles/file/about/director/pubs/BPEA1985_2.pdf External Debt and Macroeconomic Performance in Latin America and East Asia]," Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 2, pp.523–573.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of neoliberal economics, however, argue that the elimination of tariffs in nations with immature tax systems reduces the government revenues that are required to service public debt.

'''Infrastructure Lifecycle Management''' (ILM) is a term coined by the [[real estate]] sector. It covers the management of all core processes around planning, [[construction]], operation, maintenance and [[Commercialization|commercialization of buildings or property]]. The life cycle of a real estate property starts with the planning and realization phase, carries on with the commercial usage and [[facility management]] and is finalized by the demolition, dismantling or conversion of the property.

'''Juan Emilio Bosch Gaviño''' (June 30, 1909 &amp;ndash; November 1, 2001) was a Dominican [[politician]], [[historian]], [[short story]] [[writer]], [[essay]]ist, [[educator]], and the first democratically elected president of the [[Dominican Republic]] for a brief time in 1963. Previously, he had been the leader of the Dominican opposition in exile to the dictatorial regime of [[Rafael Trujillo]] for over 25 years. To this day he is remembered as an honest politician&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=25S: la política no es un negocio|url=http://www.elcaribe.com.do/2013/09/26/25s-politica-negocio|accessdate=25 December 2013|newspaper=El Caribe|date=25 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226123806/http://www.elcaribe.com.do/2013/09/26/25s-politica-negocio|archivedate=26 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Honradez de Bosch chocó con intereses|url=http://www.listindiario.com/mobile/article.aspx?id=160155|accessdate=25 December 2013|newspaper=Listin Diario|date=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sugiere exaltar Bosch al Panteón Nacional|url=http://almomento.net/articulo/136053/Sugiere-exaltar-Bosch-al-Panteon-Nacional|accessdate=25 December 2013|newspaper=Al Momento|date=9 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227055208/http://almomento.net/articulo/136053/Sugiere-exaltar-Bosch-al-Panteon-Nacional|archivedate=27 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and regarded as one of the most prominent writers in [[Dominican Republic literature|Dominican literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natalicio de Juan Bosch, el escritor|url=http://www.educando.edu.do/articulos/docente/natalicio-de-juan-bosch-el-escritor/|publisher=Educando|accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Juan Bosch Gaviño|url=http://www.escritoresdominicanos.com/bosch.html|publisher=Escritores dominicanos|accessdate=25 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226210945/http://www.escritoresdominicanos.com/bosch.html|archivedate=26 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=¿Quién es Juan Bosch?|url=http://www.literatura.us/juanbosch/|publisher=Literatura.us|accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded both the [[Dominican Revolutionary Party]] (PRD) in 1939 and the [[Dominican Liberation Party]] (PLD) in 1973.

==Early life==
He was born to a [[Catalans|Catalan]] father and a Puerto Rican mother of [[Galicians|Galician]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Núñez Núñez|first1=Milcíades Alberto|title=Juan Bosch: Sus ancestros|url=http://www.idg.org.do/capsulas/marzo2008/marzo200815.htm|publisher=Instituto Dominicano de Genealogía|accessdate=20 April 2015|location=Santo Domingo|language=Spanish|date=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Paul, [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/02/world/juan-bosch-92-freely-elected-dominican-president-dies.html Juan Bosch, 92, Freely Elected Dominican President, Dies]. ''The New York Times''. 2 November 2001. Retrieved 20 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1934, he married Isabel García and had two children with her: Leon and Carolina. During Trujillo's dictatorship, Bosch was jailed for his political ideas, being released after several months. In 1938, Bosch managed to leave the country, settling in [[Puerto Rico]].

==A long exile==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
By 1939 Bosch had gone to [[Cuba]], where he directed an edition of the completed works of [[Eugenio María de Hostos]], something that defined his patriotic and humanist ideals. In July, with other Dominican expatriates, he founded the Partido Revolucionario Dominicano (PRD), which stood out as the most active front against Trujillo outside the Dominican Republic.

Bosch heavily sympathised with leftist ideas, but he always denied any communist affiliation. He collaborated with the [[Cuban Revolutionary Party]] and had an important role in the making of the Constitution that was promulgated in 1940.

Bosch married for the second time, this time a Cuban lady, Carmen Quidiello, with whom he had two more children, Patricio and Barbara. At the same time, his literary career was ascending, gaining important acknowledgments like the Hernandez Catá Prize in Havana for short stories written by a Latin American author. His works had a deep social content, among them "La Noche Buena de Encarnación Mendoza", "Luis Pié", "The Masters" and "The Indian Manuel Sicuri", all of them described by critics as masterpieces of the sort.

Bosch was one of the main organizers of the abortive [[Cayo Confites expedition]] of 1947, in which a military force backed by the [[Caribbean Legion]] unsuccessfully attempted to invade the Dominican Republic from Cuba. Bosch fled to [[Venezuela]] after the expedition's failure, where he continued his anti-Trujillo campaign. In Cuba, where he returned by requirement of his friends in the [[Authentic Revolutionary Party]], he played a notorious part in the political life of Havana, being recognized as a promoter of social legislation and author of the speech pronounced by President [[Carlos Prío Socarrás]] when the body of [[José Martí]] was transferred to [[Santiago de Cuba]].

When [[Fulgencio Batista]] led a [[coup d'etat]] against Prío Socarrás and took over the presidency in 1952, Bosch was jailed by Batista's forces. After being liberated, he left Cuba and headed to [[Costa Rica]], where he dedicated his time to pedagogical tasks, and to his activities as leader of the PRD.

In 1959 the [[Cuban Revolution]] took place, led by [[Fidel Castro]], causing a major political, economic and social upheaval in the Caribbean island. Bosch accurately perceived the process that had begun from those events, and wrote a letter to Trujillo, dated February 27, 1961. He told Trujillo that his political role, in historical terms, had concluded in the Dominican Republic.

==Presidency and opposition==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
After 23 years in exile, Juan Bosch returned to his homeland months after Trujillo was assassinated on May 30, 1961. His presence in the national political life, as the [[Dominican Revolutionary Party]] presidential candidate, was a fresh change for the Dominicans. His manner of speaking, direct and simple, especially when addressing the lowest classes, appealed to farmers as much as people from the cities. Immediately he was accused by the Church and by conservatives of being a communist. However, in the [[Dominican Republic general election, 1962|elections]] of December 20, 1962, Bosch and his running mate, Armando González Tamayo, won a sweeping victory over [[Viriato Fiallo]] of the ''National Civic Union'' in what is acknowledged to be the first free election in the country's history.

On February 27, 1963, Bosch was sworn in as president in a ceremony that was attended by important democratic leaders and personalities, like [[Luis Muñoz Marín|Luis Muñoz]] and [[José Figueres Ferrer|José Figueres]].  Bosch immediately launched a deep restructuring of the country. On April 29, he promulgated a new liberal constitution.  The new document granted the people freedoms they had never known.  Among other things, it declared specific labour rights, and mentioned unions, pregnant women, homeless people, the family, rights for the child and the young, for the farmers, and for illegitimate children.

However, Bosch faced powerful enemies. He moved to break up [[latifundia]], drawing the ire of landowners.  The Church thought Bosch was trying to [[secularization|oversecularize]] the country.  Industrialists did not like the new Constitution's guarantees for the [[working class]]. The military, who previously enjoyed free rein, felt Bosch put them on too short a leash. In addition, the [[United States]] was skeptical of even a hint of [[Left-leaning|left-leaning politics]] in the Caribbean after [[Fidel Castro]] openly declared himself a [[Communist]].

==Coup d'état==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
On September 25, 1963, after only seven months in office, Bosch was overthrown in a coup led by Colonel [[Elías Wessin]] and replaced by a three-man [[military junta]]. Bosch went back to exile in [[Puerto Rico]].

Less than two years later, growing dissatisfaction generated another military rebellion on April 24, 1965, that demanded Bosch's restoration. The insurgents, commanded by Colonel [[Francisco Caamaño]], removed the junta from power on April 28. The United States dispatched 42,000 troops to the island during the ensuing [[Dominican civil war|civil war]] in support of the anti-Bosch forces.

An interim government was formed, and elections were fixed for July 1, 1966. Bosch returned to the country and ran as his party's presidential candidate. However, he ran a somewhat muted campaign, fearing for his safety and believing he'd be thrown out of office by the military again if he won. He was soundly defeated by [[Joaquín Balaguer]], who garnered 57% of the vote.

During the last half of the 1960s, Bosch remained a very prolific writer of essays, both political and historical. He published some of his most important works during this time: "Dominican Social Composition", "Brief History of the Oligarchy in Santo Domingo", "From Christopher Columbus to Fidel Castro", and numerous articles of different sorts.

By 1970, Bosch had the intention of reorganizing the PRD, and turning its members into active, studious militants of the historical and social reality of the country. His project was not accepted by most of the PRD, most of whose members were turning in a more mainstream social democratic direction. Also, given the military repression, and lack of political equality between the PRD and the official Reformist Party, Bosch abstained from the 1970 elections.

The differences and contradictions between Bosch and an important sector of the PRD, as well as the corruption that had started to grow within the party, made him leave the organization in 1973, and thus he founded the [[Dominican Liberation Party]] (PLD) on December 15 of that same year.

Later he ran unsuccessfully for president as the PLD candidate in 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, and 1994.  He came closest to winning in 1990, but there were serious allegations of fraud against Balaguer.

After placing third in the 1994 election, Bosch retired from politics. He was already 83 years old and presumably suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]].  In 1996 he was practically carried to the consolidation of the "Patriotic Front", an alliance between the PLD and his lifelong opponent Balaguer, as part of the latter's plan to defeat the PRD in the next presidential election.

==Death and legacy==
{{one source|section|date=December 2014}}
Juan Bosch died on November 1, 2001, in Santo Domingo. As a former President, he received the corresponding honors at the National Palace, and was buried in his hometown of La Vega.

To this day, he is remembered as a man of [[principle]]s. Over the years, as his luck rose and fell, his political direction oscillated wildly. He described himself as a "non-Communist" and a friend of Fidel Castro, and he told an interviewer in 1988 that he had never been Marxist.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In 2009, the writer Evelyn Marte published a book named [[Los Bosch Gaviño: apuntes y gráficas sobre su historia familiar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Evelyn Marte Rodríguez |url=http://www.listin.com.do/la-vida/2009/6/29/106375/Los-Bosch-Gavino |title=Los Bosch Gaviño - listindiario.com |publisher=Listin.com.do |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which details the life of Juan Bosch and the Family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2422">A '''labor market area''' is a geographic area or region defined for purposes of compiling, reporting, and evaluating [[employment]], [[unemployment]], [[workforce]] availability, and related topics. It can be defined as an economically integrated region within which residents can find jobs within a reasonable commuting distance or can change their employment without changing their place of residence.&lt;ref name=LMAsBLS2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/lau/lmadir.pdf |title=Labor Market Areas, 2013 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics |date=March 2013 |page=iii}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Commuting]] flows are a primary consideration in defining and delineating labor market areas. The extent to which workers are willing and able to commute between two places indicates the degree of economic integration between those places.&lt;ref name=SmallCriteriaBLS2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/lau/lmadir.pdf |title=Appendix II. Criteria for Designating Small Labor Market Areas |work=Labor Market Areas, 2013 |publisher=U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics |date=March 2013 |page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS) maintains standard definitions of labor market areas for the purpose of standardization and to promote comparability of the labor force information used by various government programs. Definitions are updated annually, and the entire system of definitions is reevaluated once each decade based on decennial census data.&lt;ref name=LMAsBLS2013/&gt; BLS uses [[metropolitan statistical area|metropolitan]] and [[micropolitan statistical area]]s, including metropolitan divisions, as its principal basis for defining labor market areas. In [[New England]], labor market area definitions are based on [[New England city and town area]]s rather than the [[county (United States)|county]]-based [[statistical area (United States)|statistical areas]] used in other parts of the country. For geographic areas outside of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas, the BLS identifies labor market areas based primarily on commuting data, with a requirement that all components of a labor market area be contiguous.&lt;ref name=SmallCriteriaBLS2013/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3606">'''Mapping the World of Women's Information Services''' &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.atria.nl/en/collection/adresses-of-organisation Atria.nl Mapping the World of Women's Information Services]&lt;/ref&gt; is an on line database of women's information centres, libraries and archives. It was developed in 1998 in the Netherlands by the International Information Centre and Archives for the Women’s Movement (IIAV) in collaboration with the [[Royal Tropical Institute]], and [[Oxfam|Oxfam, GB]], with a grant from [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wieringa|first=Saskia |title=Traveling Heritages: New Perspecitves on Collecting, Preserving, and Sharing Women's History|publisher=[[Amsterdam University Press]]|year=2008|page=136|isbn=9789052602998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presently [[Atria (institute)|Atria]], institute on gender equality and women’s history, the successor of the IIAV, maintains the database.

It contains almost 600 women's information centres from over 130 countries and can be accessed through the Atria website.

==Finding relevant sources of women's information==
The Mapping the World database is a tool for finding sources of women's information, that are open to the public. The centers provide the information, which includes a description of the center, highlights in their collections, and contact information.
Many of the centers listed in the database have resources such as books, periodicals, and photos, to be viewed and used on site at the center, or to be searched on line through their website.

==What are Women’s Information Services==

Women have collected and disseminated information for hundreds of years, but it is only from early 20th century that centres have been developed for the specific purpose of collecting and documenting what has come to be known as women’s information. Women’s information envelops a wide spectrum of material, cultural, political and educational issues.

Women’s information centres give women access to information that affects them. In the past fifty years, influenced by the worldwide women’s movement, collections have become more established and have developed their own professional instruments  (for example the Women’s Thesaurus,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.atria.nl/en/library-archive/womens-thesaurus Women's Thesaurus]&lt;/ref&gt; an instrument developed to index women’s information).

Women’s information services include:
* International, national and local women’s information services
* Women’s documentation and research centres connected to universities
* Gender specific information sections in governmental organisations, and
* Resource centres in which, among others, women’s information is collected,
* Or, where the development of the women’s movement is still in its early stages, such as in newly democratic countries, or in countries where war has destabilised development, a women’s magazine, a radio or TV programme are often ‘focal point’ for women’s information, accessible to the public.

==Targetgroup==
The database is a resource for anyone looking for print, on line, photographic, audio-visual, or other resources about women.  Sources of women's information are to be found in over 50 languages, covering hundreds of relevant subjects, from more than 130 countries. 
Targetusers are women and women’s organizations, policymakers, decision-makers and general information services.

The {{Nihongo|'''Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry'''|経済産業省|Keizai-sangyō-shō}} or '''METI''', is a  [[Ministry (government department)|ministry]] of the [[Government of Japan]]. It was created by the [[2001 Central Government Reform]] when the [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] merged with agencies from other ministries related to economic activities, such as the [[Economic Planning Agency]].

METI has jurisdiction over a broad policy area, containing Japan's industrial/trade policies, energy security, control of arms exports, "[[Cool Japan]]", etc. METI is known for its liberal atmosphere and officials of METI have been well known for their excellence. It is commonly called "human resource agency" for its leaders of politics, business and academia.

==Information-Technology Promotion Agency==
The {{Nihongo|Information-Technology Promotion Agency|情報処理推進機構}} is an [[Independent Administrative Institution]] that was created in January 2004 in order to better carry out on behalf of METI certain provisions of the '''Act on Facilitation of Information Processing''' (''Information Processing law, 1970 Law No. 90''). The agency was created from a former Incorporated Administrative Agency of the same name (founded 1986) within the ministry. Its primary role is to promote the development and effective use of Japanese made [[Information Technology]] at home and abroad, and in addition help ensure IT's positive effect on both society and the national economy. As of the late 2000s, the agency was concentrating on improving the competitiveness of Japanese created [[software]] in the global marketplace, though the ongoing development of advanced [[Computer hardware|hardware]] is also still considered to be of importance. The former includes the nurturing of the next generation of Japanese [[software developer]]s. As part of this, it for a long time played a major role in [[Standards organization|setting and enforcing standards]] in the Japanese IT industry, in particular in the area of software development. In 2010 however, in a (ultimately highly unsuccessful) reorganization carried out by the then [[Democratic Party of Japan|ruling party]], certain functions of the IPA in this area were controversially privatized. Among other things, the ''Information Technology Engineers Examination Center'' which had been previously an important component of the IPA's maintenance of IT standards was disbanded by 2011. Various other important projects &amp; initiatives were scrapped or severely disrupted. The IPA also has a role in helping to co-ordinate national security aspects of IT, though neglect by successive governments meant that until recently this was more apparent than real.

Presently as of 2015, certain elements and functions of the IPA are still in flux, due both to the aforementioned botched 2010 'reform' along with various attempts since then to try to fix the damage, and recent negative developments in the area of [[Computer security|IT security]] for Japan's government &amp; industries.

The '''Modern Hungary Movement''' ({{lang-hu|Modern Magyarország Mozgalom}}), abbreviated to '''MoMa''', is a [[liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]]&lt;ref name="MEP Bokros"&gt;{{cite news |title=MEP Bokros, controversial former finance minister, founds new free-market political party |author= |url=http://www.bbj.hu/economy/mep-bokros-controversial-former-finance-minister-founds-new-free-market-political-party_65562 |newspaper=Budapest Business Journal |date=22 April 2013 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[political party]] in [[Hungary]].  Founded by former [[Minister of Finance of Hungary|Finance Minister]] [[Lajos Bokros]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] on 21 April 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Kommunistából konzervatív?" Bokros Lajos a MoMa élére állt |author= |url=http://mno.hu/belfold/kommunistabol-konzervativ-bokros-lajos-a-moma-elere-allt-1153851 |newspaper=mno.hu |date=21 April 2013 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; MoMa stands for [[free market]], [[Classical liberalism|liberal]] values and champions "individual freedom, the free market, and the freedom of private and intellectual property".&lt;ref name="MEP Bokros" /&gt;

The party claims to be modelled on the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="MEP Bokros" /&gt;

MoMa decided not to participate in the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2014|2014 parliamentary election]], because "they do not want to weaken the cooperation of left-wing parties with separate candidates." Bokros criticized and resented that his party were excluded from the alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=18 January 2014|url=http://mandiner.hu/cikk/20140117_bokros_lajos_vagyunk_mi_olyan_sulyosak_mint_fodorek|title=Vagyunk mi olyan súlyosak, mint Fodorék|date=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later MoMa formally asked its supporters to vote [[Unity (Hungary)|Unity]] in the 2014 general election, after receiving constitutional guarantees from the left-wing opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=19 February 2014|url=http://www.politics.hu/20140219/bokross-group-to-support-unity-from-outside/|title=Bokros’s group to support Unity from outside|date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party planned to run in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Hungary)|2014 European Parliament election]], however its registration was refused by the National Election Office (NVI). As a result Bokros lost his European Parliament mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=26 May 2014|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20140505-a-momanak-nincs-meg-az-indulashoz-szukseges-huszezer-ervenyes-ajanlasa.html|title=Mégsem indulhat Bokros az EP-választáson|date=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bokros also ran for [[Mayor of Budapest]] in the [[Hungarian local elections, 2014|2014 municipal election]]. On 29 September 2014, two other candidates, the independent György Magyar and candidate of the leftist opposition parties' Ferenc Falus withdrew from the election and supported Bokros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=29 September 2014|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2014/09/28/falus_ferenc_visszalep/|title=Falus Ferenc visszalép|date=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bokros received 36.04% of the votes and came second after [[István Tarlós]]. He was supported by  [[Together 2014]], the [[Democratic Coalition (Hungary)|Democratic Coalition]] and the Budapest branch of the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=13 October 2014|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2014/10/12/tarlos_win/|title=Tarlós István harca csak most kezdődik|date=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, the MoMa made an electoral coalition with the Democratic Coalition (DK) for the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2018|2018 parliamentary election]]. In the same time Bokros announced his "500 days programme" which contained the short-lived inevitable cooperation of the "democratic opposition parties" after the victory to "restore democracy" and "break down the Orbán regime". Bokros argued another by-election is required after the successful restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=14 March 2018|url=http://www.atv.hu/belfold/20170901-bejelentettek-egyutt-indul-jovore-a-dk-es-a-bokros-lajos-vezette-moma|title=Bejelentették: Együtt indul jövőre a DK és a Bokros Lajos vezette MoMa|date=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, Bokros announced the DK has not kept its promise and rejected the agreement; as a result the MoMa aimed to participate in the election individually. DK issued a statement saying, Bokros  refused their "fair offer" to provide a single mandate for his party with "not measurable support".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=14 March 2018|url=https://index.hu/belfold/2018/valasztas/2018/01/12/onalloan_indult_a_moma_a_valasztasokon/|title=Bokros: Gyurcsány átvert minket|date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nonviolent Peaceforce''' (NP) is a nonpartisan unarmed peacekeeping organization with the goal of protecting civilians and reducing violence in areas affected by armed conflict. NP holds Special Consultative Status with the [[Economic and Social Council of the United Nations]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/press/en/2007/ecosoc6267.doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and has been endorsed by nine Nobel Peace Prize laureates, including the [[Dalai Lama]] and former South African Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]].&lt;ref name=StarTrib/&gt; In 2016, Nonviolent Peaceforce was nominated for a [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name="startribune.com"&gt;http://www.startribune.com/nonviolent-peaceforce-nominated-for-nobel-peace-prize/370729351/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The organization was founded by David Ray Hartsough, a US Quaker and civil rights activist, and [[Mel Duncan]], former US member of the Nicaragua coffee/cotton brigades during the Contra war of 1984. The organization, first prompted by a 1999 citizens' conference in The Hague,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shifferd|first=Kent D.|title=From War to Peace: A Guide to the Next Hundred Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oVmLBTsBxH0C&amp;pg=PA181|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786485239|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in [[New Delhi]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharma|first=Arvind|title=The World's Religions: A Contemporary Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0LVAaTB3iDUC&amp;pg=PA73|year=2010|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=9780800697464|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mel Duncan served as Executive Director until 2009, in [[Minneapolis, MN]]. The central office moved to [[Brussels, Belgium]] in 2010 under Executive Director Tim Wallis, while retaining its U.S. operations in Minneapolis, {{As of|2013|12|lc=yes}} near the [[Loring Park]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name=StarTrib&gt;{{cite news |first=Jean |last=Hopfensperger |url=http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/236127951.html |newspaper=Minneapolis Star Tribune |title=Philanthropy beat: Nonviolent Peaceforce gets unexpected gift |date=December 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was led by Doris Mariani until 31 May 2016, when Executive Director Tiffany Easthom took over. The organization has central offices in [[St. Paul, MN]], and Brussels, Belgium. It is registered in the US as a 501(c)(3) organization and in Belgium as an AISBL.

=== Past Projects ===

==== Sri Lanka (2003-2011) ====
The pilot project of NP was started in 2003 in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="wallace"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=M. S.|editor=Joseph R. Rudolph, William J. Lahneman|title=From Mediation to Nation-Building: Third Parties and the Management of Communal Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CUEwn4mWlCcC&amp;pg=PA333|year=2013|publisher=Lexington|isbn=9780739176955|pages=333–51|chapter=Security Without Weapons: Nonviolent Peaceforce in Sri Lanka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonviolent Peaceforce peacekeepers were at work there between 2003 and 2008 but they could not stop the war that reoccurred in 2008 and came to an end only when the SLA defeated LTEE in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Mary|date=2010|title=Confronting wrongs, affirming difference: The limits of violence, the power of nonviolence, and the case of nonviolent intervention in Sri Lanka|url=|journal=Ann Arbor Dissertations|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Mary|date=2010|title=Confronting wrongs, affirming difference: The limits of violence, the power of nonviolence, and the case of nonviolent intervention in Sri Lanka|url=|journal=Brown University Dissertations|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After 2009, NP continued work in the country for two years, mainly on child protection, helping to integrate former child soldiers back into everyday life, and working with local communities to bolster their own self-protection capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irenees.net/bdf_fiche-analyse-689_fr.html|title=Sri Lanka and NP: monitoring impact and success - Irénées|website=www.irenees.net|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, NP officially closed its mission in Sri Lanka.

==== Guatemala (2007) ====
NP had a short-term engagement in Guatemala in 2007.  Nonviolent Peaceforce had been invited by the Unidad de Protección a Defensoras y Defensores de Derechos Humanos (UDEFEGUA), the Protection Unit for Human Rights Defenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nonviolentpeaceforce.org/what-we-do/past-operations/guatemala|title=Past Operations Guatemala|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the presidential elections taking place in September and November 2007, violence increased and human rights defenders were threatened; a small team of four members focused on accompanying the human rights defenders or being present in their office day and night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irenees.net/bdf_fiche-analyse-715_en.html|title=The activities undertaken by NP in Guatemala - Irénées|website=www.irenees.net|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NP's work there allowed human rights defenders to function in a hostile climate, and they left shortly after elections were finished.

==== South Caucasus (2012-2014) ====
After an exploratory mission in the region, NP deployed its team to the South Caucasus in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Schweitzer, Christine: Humanitarian Protection as an Additional Function of Humanitarian, Development and Peace Projects – or Rather a Task Requiring Experts?”, in: id. (Ed.): Civilian Peacekeeping – A Barely Trapped Resource, Wahlenau 2010, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  There they worked along the Administrative Boundary Line between Georgian Tbilisi-Administered-Territories and de facto South Ossetia on civilian protection capacities in the region while canvassing to determine other places in the area that might benefit from unarmed civilian protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nonviolentpeaceforce.org/what-we-do/past-operations/south-caucasus|title=South Caucasus|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NP left the area in 2014.

==== Ukraine (2015) ====
After many rounds of exploration missions in the country, Nonviolent Peaceforce was invited to Ukraine in March 2015 to conduct trainings on unarmed civilian protection for civil society groups and the communities they serve.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pjep.org/news/Nonviolent-Peaceforce-in-Ukraine|title=Nonviolent Peaceforce Ukraine :: Peace, Justice and Environment Project|website=www.pjep.org|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was conducted with the Association for Middle Eastern Studies and was the first time UCP had been introduced in Ukraine.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Ongoing Projects ===

==== Philippines (2007-) ====
In Mindanao, Philippines a ceasefire was the starting point for the invitation of NP by local peace organizations (e.g. [[Mindanao peoples Caucus]] and Consortium of Bangsamoro Civil Society). After a short time, NP Philippines was part of the [[International Monitoring Team]] (IMT) to oversee the ceasefire agreement between the Philippine Army and the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]], a guerilla organization that sought independence and later self-determination for the southern island of Mindanao. NP is responsible for the Civilian Protection Component which had its antecedents (and still relies on) the Independent Fact-Finding Committee and Bantay Ceasefire.&lt;ref&gt;Lustenberger, Philipp: Civilian Protection: From the International to the Grassroots Level, in: Zartman, I.W./P.T. Hopman (Eds.): Mindanao. Understanding Conflict 2011, Washington 2011, p. 52-54&lt;/ref&gt;

An impact evaluation done in May 2014 found that citizens in Mindanao felt safer due to Nonviolent Peaceforce’s presence and their role as part of the CPC for IMT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nonviolentpeaceforce.org/images/publications/mediatEUr_IID_NP_Mindanao_evaluation_report_final_06May14.pdf|title=Evaluation of the Nonviolent Peaceforce Project with the Civilian Protection Component of the International Monitoring Team in Mindanao, Philippine|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Southern part of Sudan, now Republic of South Sudan (2010-) ====
After the cancellation of a proposed project in Uganda, the peace agreement between Sudan and the Sudan Liberation Army as well as the planned independence referendum in South Sudan in January 2011 provided a starting point for exploring and later implementing a project in Sudan/South Sudan.

Two Sudanese organizations, the Institute for the Promotion of Civil Society (IPCS) and the Sudanese Organization for Nonviolence and Development (SONAD),  invited NP to assist  in preventing violence before and during the forthcoming elections and referendum.&lt;ref&gt;see: interview with Oloo Otieno, in: Ricci, Andrea (Ed.): From Early Warning to Early Action? The Debate on the enhancement of the EU's crisis response capability continues, European Commission, DG External Relations, Brüssel 2008 [part 2: Crisis Response - Mediation and Peacekeeping] = http://eeas.europa.eu/ifs/publications/book_2_en.htm, last retrieved: 09.08.2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The more general task, also for the time after the referendum, was to build up local expertise for preventing and mediating in inter-ethnic conflicts in the region. The assignment was led by a Sri Lankan peacekeeper who was responsible for the  protection of children in Sri Lanka. In South Sudan, UNICEF financed a similar project specifically for Ugandan child soldiers who were recruited by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). The field offices have since been extended to ten teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/can-unarmed-peacekeeping-work-syria-south-sudan/|title=Can unarmed peacekeeping work in Syria? It has in South Sudan - Waging Nonviolence|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Nonviolent Peaceforce’s work in South Sudan focuses on child protection and women’s protection. They have successfully trained many women on the ground to form “Women’s Peacekeeping Teams” (WPTs) in order to reduce gender-based violence on the ground.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/meet-the-all-women-peacekeeping-force-of-south-sudan|title=Meet the All-Women Peacekeeping Force of South Sudan {{!}} Broadly|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  WPTs have also been cited as empowering women on the ground in South Sudan while simultaneously emphasizing the importance of protecting women and children.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On 8 March 2016, Nonviolent Peaceforce launched an $8 million project on "Promoting Women's Role in Peacebuilding and Gender-Based Violence Prevention in South Sudan".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nonviolentpeaceforce.org/images/PressKit/Dutch_Grant_Launch_Website_Text_1.pdf|title=NONVIOLENT PEACEFORCE LAUNCHES NEW $8 MILLION GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE PROJECT IN SOUTH SUDAN|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The funding for the project came from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and will be functionally funded through the Dutch Embassy in South Sudan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Myanmar (2012-) ====
In 2012, Nonviolent Peaceforce received an official invitation from the Government of Myanmar.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cpnn-world.org/cgi-bin/read/articlepage.cgi?ViewArticle=1042|title=Read a Peace Report- Myanmar Invites Nonviolent Peaceforce to Support Peace Processes|website=cpnn-world.org|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the main tasks NP has there is to monitor ceasefires and to set up mechanisms by which civilians can monitor them.  They hold trainings across the country for these purposes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  NP is also supporting women's organizations on the ground, aiding them in taking a more prominent role in guiding decision-making at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yearzerofilms.co.uk/myanmar-witness.html|title=MYANMAR WITNESS {{!}} Year Zero Films|website=www.yearzerofilms.co.uk|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lebanon/Syria (2012-) ====
Nonviolent Peaceforce's activity in the Middle East began in 2012 with a joint training with the UN Office on Genocide Prevention and Responsibility to Protect for activists in civil society in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nonviolentpeaceforce.org/what-we-do/2014-09-19-15-18-31/syria|title=Middle East|language=en-gb|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The seminar was part of an initiative by the UN in response to increasing polarization in the area.

==== Iraq (2017-) ====

Nonviolent Peaceforce began work in Iraq in February 2017, establishing an office in Erbil, in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) and deploying staff to facilitate the start-up of a country programme. NP initially focused on the provision of frontline protection services to internally displaced persons (IDP) along the displacement corridors during the military offensives to retake ISIS-controlled areas. Since the end of major combat operations against ISIS, NP has refocused efforts on vulnerable IDPs in camps, returnees in contested and high-risk areas, tensions along the disputed Federal Iraq and KRI border, and arbitrary detentions.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==== Bangladesh (2018-) ====

Nonviolent Peaceforce started working in Cox's Bazar, the world’s largest refugee camp located in Bangladesh in 2018.  As the refugee crisis unfolds, and overwhelming humanitarian needs emerge, the NP team is working with local partners to improve the safety of people living in the camp and to prepare for the flooding and mudslides of the rainy season. NP is building collaborative relationships with local non-governmental organizations, internal Rohingya-led organizations, and international non-governmental organizations and is providing protection to these organizations responsible for overseeing the camp.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

== Organizational Elements ==

The work of NP consists of three pillars: projects in conflict areas; lobbying, especially within United Nations as well as European Commission and European Parliament; training. The organizational and administrative day-to-day duties are carried out by the secretariat- headed by the Executive Director. The programmatic work (on projects, explorations, budget and policies) is the task of the international board called International Governing Council (IGC).&lt;ref&gt;Mel Duncan, Mark Zissman, Patrick Savaiano:  Nonviolent Peaceforce: A Realistic Choice for the Future, in. Stout, Chris E. (Ed.): The New Humanitarians: Inspirations, Innovations, and Blueprints for Visionaries, Vol. 3, Changing Sustainable Development and Social Justice, Westport CT/London 2009, pp. 89-104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
Together with its founder [[Mel Duncan]], the organization in 2007 received the [[International Pfeffer Peace Award]] from the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation (United States)|Fellowship of Reconciliation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FOR to Hold Third Annual Festival of Peace in Nyack |publisher=[[Fellowship of Reconciliation (United States)|Fellowship of Reconciliation]] |url=http://forusa.org/content/for-hold-third-annual-festival-peace-nyack |accessdate=18 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119084030/http://forusa.org/content/for-hold-third-annual-festival-peace-nyack |archivedate=19 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Luxembourg Peace Prize was awarded to the organization in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nonviolentpeaceforce.org/about-12/733-an-award-for-your-support|title=An Award for Your Support|last=Spitz|first=Liesl|website=www.nonviolentpeaceforce.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}
The '''Paasikivi-Kekkonen doctrine ''' refers to a [[foreign policy doctrine]] established by [[Finnish President]] [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi]] and continued by his successor [[Urho Kekkonen]], aimed at [[Finland]]'s survival as an independent [[sovereignty|sovereign]], [[democracy|democratic]], and [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[country]] in the immediate proximity of the [[Soviet Union]].

The principal architect of Finland's postwar [[Foreign relations of Finland|foreign policy]] of [[neutral country|neutrality]] was [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi]], who was president from 1946 to 1956.&lt;ref name=publico&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publico.es/internacional/finlandia-crisis-otros-anoran.html |title=Finlandia, la 'crisis' que otros añoran |access-date=November 8, 2017 |last=Ferrero |first=Ángel |date=June 4, 2016 |work=Publico |publisher= |location= |language=spanish |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urho Kekkonen]], president from 1956 until 1981, further developed this policy, stressing that Finland should be an active rather than a passive neutral.

== Background ==
Finland and the Soviet Union signed the [[Paris Peace Treaty]] in February 1947, which in addition to the concessions of the [[Moscow Peace Treaty]] provided for:
* Limiting the size of [[Finnish Defence Forces|Finland's defense forces]],
* Cession to the Soviet Union of the [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]] area on the [[Arctic]] coast,
* Lease of the [[Porkkala]] [[peninsula]] off Helsinki to the Soviets for use as a [[naval base]]  for 50 years (it was returned ahead of schedule in 1956),
* Free transit access to this area across Finnish territory, and
* [[War reparations]] to the Soviet Union decided to 300 million gold dollars (amounting to an estimated 570 million [[U.S. dollar]]s in 1952, the year the payments ended).

== Realization ==
In April 1948, Finland signed an [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance]] with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Finland/The-postwar-period |title=Finland - The postwar period |access-date=November 8, 2017 |last= |first= |date= |work= |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=London |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this mutual assistance pact, Finland was obligated, with the aid of the Soviet Union, if necessary, to resist armed attacks by "Germany or its allies" (i.e., [[NATO]]) against Finland or against the Soviet Union ''through'' Finland. At the same time, the agreement recognized Finland's desire to remain outside great-power conflicts. This agreement was renewed for 20 years in 1955, in 1970, and again in 1983.&lt;ref name=publico /&gt; This allowed Finland to retain independence in internal affairs, e.g. a multiparty parliamentary system, and not to join the [[Eastern Bloc]]. However, joining NATO or other overt alliance with the West was out of question&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; and foreign policy was often limited.

== Criticism ==
Contemporary Finns often criticized the Paasikivi-Kekkonen doctrine  as tending towards a "liturgy" of good relations. Both countries were militarily prepared. However, international trade was active, in the framework of [[bilateral trade]]. Furthermore, the policy was heavily tied to the person of President Kekkonen, who consequently exploited his position as a "guarantor of Soviet relations" against political opponents. Outright censorship was employed for films and works considered explicitly anti-Soviet (e.g. ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]''), although political freedoms were not otherwise coercively limited.

Later criticism has included the following points:
* The Soviet Union did not consider Finland a neutral country, but "striving to be neutral". Although Kekkonen was largely successful in retaining sovereign power over affairs in Finland, Finland's position on international affairs, such as the invasion of Czechoslovakia, was often ambiguous or Soviet-friendly. The [[1977 Aeroflot Tupolev Tu-134 hijacking|1977 hijacking of a Soviet airliner]] further exemplifies this; the undue influence of the Soviet ambassador, who would storm a government meeting to make demands, shows that the Finnish government had trouble fending off Soviet interference.&lt;ref name="Tiilikainen"&gt;Tiilikainen, Heikki. ''Kylmän sodan kujanjuoksu.''&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union had an unusually large diplomatic mission in Finland, and Kekkonen communicated with the Soviet Union through the [[KGB]] [[station chief]] rather than by regular diplomatic channels. The Soviets intervened in Finnish politics in various ways, e.g. through the [[Communist Party of Finland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loyno.edu/~history/journal/1985-6/botticelli.htm |title=Finland's Relations with the Soviet Union, 1940-1986 |access-date=November 8, 2017 |last=Botticelli |first=Peter |date= |work= |publisher= |location= |language= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Soviet-friendly contacts in other parties (e.g. Kekkonen's ''K-linja'' in the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]]).
* The Soviet military kept a separate unit in readiness to invade Helsinki from Tallinn in the case of war. The plans, which were fully up-to-date, were left behind in the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Estonia after Estonia regained independence in 1991.
* The policy had little respect in the West. Western foreign policy actors and military personnel either did not know about the policy or assumed it was a failure from the outset. Regarding the former, British military officers were known to have queried how many Soviet troops were in Finland.&lt;ref name="Tiilikainen" /&gt; Regarding the latter, nuclear weapons were trained on targets in Finland, with the assumption that any possible Finnish resistance to a Soviet invasion would be a certain failure.
* There was covert cooperation between the Finnish government and Western intelligence agencies. The CIA could fund the anti-Communist [[Social Democratic Party (Finland)|Social Democratic Party]], a major, often government-leading party, though it gradually became unusually pro-Soviet beginning in the late 1960s, with many radical leftists holding influential posts among other such parties. There was also military intelligence cooperation, for instance allowing SIGINT flights to probe the Soviet radar network (according to Pekka Visuri) and providing seismic data to detect Soviet nuclear tests.

== Liquidation ==
The Finns responded cautiously in 1990–91 to the decline of Soviet power and the USSR's subsequent [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]]. They unilaterally abrogated restrictions imposed by the 1947 and 1948 treaties with the exception of a ban on acquiring [[nuclear weapons]], joined in voicing [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] concerns over the coup against Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and gave increasing unofficial encouragement to [[Baltic states|Baltic]] independence.

At the same time, by replacing the Soviet-Finnish mutual assistance pact with treaties on general cooperation and trade, Finns put themselves on an equal footing while retaining a friendly bilateral relationship. Finland now is boosting cross-border commercial ties and touting its potential as a commercial gateway to Russia. It has reassured [[Russia]] that it will not raise claims about the [[Karelian question in Finnish politics|formerly Finnish territory]] ceded after the [[Continuation War]] (though a small but vocal minority of the people disagrees), and continues to reaffirm the importance of good bilateral relations.

The '''Post-Conflict Research Center''' (PCRC) is a Sarajevo-based non-governmental organization, which aims to nurture an enabling environment for sustainable [[peace]] and facilitate the restoration of inter-ethnic relationships in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]]. PCRC's expertise consists of innovative [[multimedia]] projects and creative educational curricula that engage youth in fostering long-lasting tolerance, mutual understanding, and social activism in the [[Western Balkans]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://p-crc.org/ Post-Conflict Research Center]&lt;/ref&gt; The Center’s overall mission is to build a robust network empowering youth with transferable skills and resources to spread an all-encompassing culture of peace among the many ethnic groups composing the country. PCRC’s main activities involve [[youth]] and [[Conflict resolution|reconciliation]], [[media freedom]], [[gender]] and peace-building through educational activities, [[storytelling]] and [[investigative journalism]].

== History ==
The PCRC was established in 2010 by Founder and Executive Director [[Velma Šarić]] and Co-founder and Project Director Leslie Woodward. They  first met in Sarajevo when Woodward, a graduate student with substantial experience in strategic peace-building, post-conflict development, and research in [[developing country]] contexts, came to attend a study abroad program course designed by Šarić, an experienced journalist and researcher in the fields of [[sociology]] and [[international law]]. Once Woodward returned to the USA, they both developed projects and wrote grants over [[Skype]] with the goal of setting up an organization dedicated to building peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://p-crc.org/our-story/ Post-Conflict Research Center - Our Story]&lt;/ref&gt; PCRC today counts 7 staff members, several interns and 40 experts providing valuable insights and guidance to the organization. PCRC brings citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina together to discuss current cultural and political issues and speak their minds with the aim to strengthen local communities in the country.

== Activities and Projects ==

PCRC’s work revolves around three main areas:&lt;ref&gt;[http://p-crc.org/mission/ Post-Conflict Research Center - Our Mission]&lt;/ref&gt; youth and reconciliation – molding positive narratives of inter-ethnic cooperation by applying examples from the past to current models of pro-social behavior; media freedom - challenging the Bosnia’s one-sided [[mainstream]] media coverage by providing a safe space where youth can discuss issues they hold dear to their hearts at the local level; gender and peace building – empowering women to influence gender rights discourses and foster positive social change, especially by aiding victims of wartime [[sexual violence]] to address impunity in Bosnia-Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://p-crc.org/strategy/ Post-Conflict Research Center - Strategy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelondonpost.net/velma-saric-a-bosnian-with-a-vision/ Velma Saric – Bosnian with vision]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Balkan Diskurs ==
One of the initiatives PCRC works on is [http://www.balkandiskurs.com/en/ Balkan Diskurs], an online platform run by a regional network of young journalists and activists, which aims to address the lack of objective and alternative media. The platform provides a space free from [[censorship]] to publish peoples’ opinions and analyses of current issues in the Western Balkans region.

== Ordinary Heroes ==
Ordinary Heroes is a [[multimedia]] educational project that uses photos, films and youth workshops to tell the accounts of four post-conflict regions - Bosnia and Herzegovina, [[Rwanda]], [[Cambodia]], and post-[[Holocaust]] [[Europe]], through stories of rescue and courage with the aim to bolstering [[toleration|tolerance]], reconciliation and inter-ethnic cooperation. The project encompasses a documentary series that portrays real-life stories of Bosnian citizens who came to rescue others during the war, workshops engaging local youth and a traveling photographic exhibition. Ordinary Heroes was designed by PCRC to foster social healing and reconciliation among inter-groups in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 2014, Ordinary Heroes was awarded the Intercultural Innovation Award by the [[United Nations Alliance of Civilizations]] (UNAOC) and the [[BMW]] Group. The award recognizes ground-breaking grassroots projects encouraging intercultural dialogue and contributing to global peace.

[[Hafez al-Assad]] served as the [[President of Syria|President]] of [[Syria]] from 1970 until his death in 2000. As of 2015, he is the longest-serving [[List of heads of state of Syria|Syrian head of state]]. He was succeeded by his son, [[Bashar al-Assad]].

==Domestic policies==

===Corrective Movement===
{{Main|Corrective Movement (Syria)}}
In 1971, while [[Prime Minister of Syria|Prime Minister]], Assad embarked upon a "corrective movement" at the Eleventh National Congress of the [[Ba'ath Party]]. There was to be a general revision of national policy, which also included the introduction of measures to consolidate his rule. His Ba'athist predecessors had restricted control of Islam in public life and government.{{sfn|Alianak|2007|pp=129–130}} Because the Constitution allowed only Muslims to become president,{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=55}} Assad, unlike his predecessor [[Salah Jadid]], presented himself as a pious [[Muslim]]. In order to gain support from the ''[[ulama]]''—the educated Muslim class— he prayed in [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[mosque]]s, even though he was an [[Alawites|Alawite]]. Among the measures he introduced were the raising in rank of some 2,000 religious functionaries and the appointment of an ''[[Ulama|alim]]'' as minister of religious functionaries and construction of mosques. He appointed a little-known Sunni teacher, [[Ahmad al-Khatib]], as Head of State in order to satisfy the Sunni majority.{{sfn|Alianak|2007|pp=129–130}} Assad also appointed Sunnis to senior positions in the government, the military and the party. All of Assad's prime ministers, defense ministers and foreign ministers and a majority of his cabinet were Sunnis. In the early 1970s, he was verified as an authentic Muslim by the Sunni Mufti of Damascus and made the ''Hajj''—the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]. In his speeches, he often used terms such as ''jihad'' (struggle) and ''shahada'' (martyrdom) when referring to fighting Israel.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=55}}

After gaining enough power, Assad needed to become leader of the Ba'ath Party, so he ordered the arrests and discharge of the incumbent party leaders, replacing them by his own supporters in the Ba'ath Regional Command. They promptly elected him as secretary-general of the party's Syrian branch, confirming his status as the country's ''de facto'' leader. The Regional Command also appointed a new People's Assembly, which in 1971 nominated him for the presidency as the only candidate. On 22 February 1971, Assad resigned from the Air Force{{sfn|Alianak|2007|p=55}}and was subsequently endorsed as president with 99.6% of the vote{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=55}} at the referendum held on 12 March 1971. He also returned the old Islamic Presidential Oath of Office.{{sfn|Alianak|2007|p=55}} While continuing to use the Ba'ath Party, its ideology and its expanding apparatus as instruments of his rule and policies, Assad established a powerful, centralized presidential system with absolute authority for the first time in Syria's modern history.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=55}}

Assad wanted his government to appear democratic. The People's Assembly and his cabinet consisted of several nationalist and socialist parties under the umbrella of the [[National Progressive Front (Syria)|National Progressive Front]], which was led by the Ba'ath Party. Half of his cabinet were representatives of peasants and workers, and a number of popular organizations of peasants, workers, women and students were established in order to participate in the decision-making process. As he gained support from the peasantry, workers, the youth, the military and the Alawite community, Assad wanted to destroy his remaining opposition. He tried to present himself as a leader-reformer, a state-builder and nation-builder by developing and modernizing the country's socio-economic infrastructure, achieving political stability, economic opportunities and ideological consensus. As he wanted to create ideological consensus and national unity, Assad advocated a dynamic regional policy while opposing [[Zionism]] and imperialism.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=56}}

On 31 January 1973, Assad implemented the new Constitution which led to a national crisis. Unlike previous constitutions, this one did not require that the  president of Syria must be a Muslim, leading to fierce demonstrations in [[Hama]], [[Homs]] and Aleppo organized by the Muslim Brotherhood and the ''ulama''. They labeled Assad as the "enemy of Allah" and called for a ''jihad'' against his rule.{{sfn|Alianak|2007|p=55}} [[Robert D. Kaplan]] has compared Assad's coming to power to "an untouchable becoming maharajah in India or a Jew becoming tsar in Russia—an unprecedented development shocking to the Sunni majority population which had monopolized power for so many centuries."&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199302/kaplan|title=Syria: Identity Crisis|last=Kaplan|first=Robert|date=February 1993|work=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assad responded by arresting about 40 Sunni officers who were accused of plotting. Nevertheless, Assad returned the requirement to the Constitution to please the Sunnis, but he stated that he "rejects every uncultured interpretation of Islam that lays bare an odious narrow-mindedness and loathsome bigotry".{{sfn|Alianak|2007|p=55}} In 1974, to satisfy this constitutional requirement, [[Moussa Sader|Musa Sadr]], a leader of the [[Twelvers]] of [[Lebanon]] and founder of the [[Amal Movement]] who had unsuccessfully tried to unite Lebanese Alawis and Shias under the Supreme Islamic Shiite Council,&lt;ref name="mideastmonitor.org"&gt;Riad Yazbeck. "[http://www.mideastmonitor.org/issues/0808/0808_2.htm#_ftn1 Return of the Pink Panthers?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219114105/http://www.mideastmonitor.org/issues/0808/0808_2.htm |date=2012-02-19 }}" ''Mideast Monitor''. Vol. 3, No. 2, August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; issued a [[fatwa]] stating that Alawis were a community of Twelver Shia Muslims.&lt;ref name="KaplanSadr"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/199302/kaplan |title=Syria: Identity Crisis |last=Kaplan |first=Robert |date=February 1993 |work=The Atlantic |quote=Today, those Muslims called Alawīs are brothers of those Shi'ites called Mutawallis by the malicious.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glasse"&gt;''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'' by Cyril Glasse, Altamira, 2001, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his entire tenure as Syria's president, Assad ruled under the terms of a state of emergency dating from 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Syria.pdf Syria country profile], pp. 15–17. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (April 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Under the provisions of the emergency law, the press was limited to three Ba'ath-controlled newspapers and political dissidents were often tried in security courts that operated outside the regular judicial system. [[Human Rights Watch]] estimated that a minimum of 17,000 people [[forced disappearance|disappeared]] without the formalities of a trial during Assad's rule.&lt;ref name="hrw.org"&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2010/07/16/wasted-decade ''Wasted Decade: Human Rights in Syria during Bashar al-Asad’s First Ten Years in Power''], [[Human Rights Watch]], 2010 Report&lt;/ref&gt; Every seven years, Assad was nominated as the sole candidate for president by the People's Council, and confirmed in office by a referendum. He was re-elected four times, each time gaining over 99 percent of the vote—including three times in which he received unanimous support, according to official figures.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen, D, Grotz, F &amp; Hartmann, C (2001) ''Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume I'', p221 {{ISBN|0-19-924958-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For all intents and purposes, he held complete political control over the country.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Islamist uprising===
{{main|Islamist uprising in Syria}}
The government faced further threats from a resurgence of the Islamist opposition. Assad's earlier support of the Christian Maronites and his military actions against the Muslim radicals in Lebanon provoked a new and unprecedented phase of Muslim resistance in the form of well-organized and effective urban guerrilla warfare against government, military, and Ba'athist officials and institutions. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Islamic ''jihad'' became almost an open rebellion as many Alawite soldiers, officers and senior officials were killed, and government and military centres were bombed by the Muslim ''[[mujahideen]]''.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=60}}

Facing a serious threat to his government and possibly to his life, Assad for the first time lost his self-confidence and reacted with fury and desperation. His health also started to deteriorate during this period. Under his personal orders a campaign of repression was launched against the Muslim Brotherhood.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=60}} Assad escaped an attempted assassination in a grenade attack in 1980. In response, troops led by his brother Rifaat took revenge by killing 250 inmates at [[Tadmor Prison]] in [[Palmyra]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;MacFarquhar, Neil. [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/11/world/hafez-al-assad-who-turned-syria-into-a-power-in-the-middle-east-dies-at-69.html Hafez al-Assad, Who Turned Syria Into a Power in the Middle East, Dies at 69]. [[New York Times]], 2000-06-11.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1982, the rebellious city of Hama was [[1982 Hama massacre|bombed by Assad's troops]], killing between 10,000 and 40,000 people.{{sfn|Chaliand|Blin|2007|p=230}}{{sfn|Schlumberger|2007|p=105}}{{sfn|Tanter|1999|p=13}} It was later described as "the single deadliest act by any Arab government against people in the modern Middle East."{{sfn|Wright|2008|pp=243–244}}{{sfn|Harris|1997|pp=166–167}} Over the next few years, thousands of Muslim Brotherhood followers were arrested and tortured, and many of them were killed or disappeared. Assad realized that his previous efforts to bring about a national unity in Syria and to gain legitimacy from the Sunni urban population had totally failed. He was confronted with resistance from the Muslim Brotherhood and thousands of their followers. Large sections of the urban intelligentsia, professionals, intellectuals and former Ba'ath Party members, also regarded his government as illegitimate.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=60}} Later, Assad used the threat of the Muslim Brotherhood to justify his heavy-handed rule.&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

===Society===
Assad became increasingly reliant on the further cultivation of his close constituencies as a support base and a new political community consisting of large sections of peasants and workers, salaried middle-class and public employees—both Sunnis and non-Sunnis. These groups, mostly organized in the Ba'ath Party, mass syndicates, and trade unions, like most Alawites and Christians, greatly benefited from Assad's policies, and either depended on him or were ideologically identified with his government.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=60}} Many young Syrians also had a strong allegiance to Assad, since they had been educated or indoctrinated in the notions of the Ba'ath Party as formulated by Assad. These sections of the population rendered legitimacy to Assad's government, and were periodically mobilised by Assad to actively support his policies and curb his domestic enemies. Assad's main support base remained the Alawite community, the combat units of the Syrian Armed Forces and the wide network of security and intelligence organizations.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=61}}

Members of the Alawite community and non-Alawites loyal to Assad virtually controlled the security, intelligence and military apparatuses. They manned or commanded about a dozen security and intelligence networks and most armoured divisions, commandos and other combat units of the Syrian Armed Forces. Assad had turned some of his intelligence networks into apparatuses for terrorism against targets in the Middle East and in Europe.

===Health problems===
In November 1983, Assad—who was a [[Diabetes|diabetic]]—suffered a serious heart attack, which was complicated by [[phlebitis]].&lt;ref name="CountryStudies/57"&gt; {{cite web |url = http://countrystudies.us/syria/57.htm |title = 1982 – 1987 Political Developments |author = Thomas Collelo, ed.|work =  Syria: A Country Study. | location = Washington | publisher = GPO for the Library of Congress |year = 1987 |accessdate = 8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He withdrew from public life and a battle for succession took place between Assad's brother Rifaat and the army generals. Assad's recovery and return brought an end to the discord and he took advantage of the situation to undermine his brother's position, eventually sending him into exile. Assad's return to supreme power was confirmed at the eight party congress in January 1985.{{sfn|Seddon|2004|p=75}}

===Economy===
{{Further|Economy of Syria}}
[[File:Tabaqah assad.jpg|thumb|left|Tabqa Dam built in 1974 (center of image).]]
Assad called his domestic reforms as a corrective movement, and achieved some results. Assad tried to modernize Syria's agricultural and industrial sectors. One of Assad's main achievements was the completion of the [[Tabqa Dam]] on the Euphrates River in 1974. It is one of the biggest dams in the world, and its reservoir was called [[Lake Assad]]. The reservoir increased the irrigation of arable land, provided electricity, and encouraged industrial and technical development in Syria. Many peasants and workers received increased financial incomes, social security, and improved health and education services. The urban middle classes, who had been hurt by the Jadid government's policy, obtained new economic opportunities.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=56}}

By 1977, it become apparent that despite some successes, Assad's political reforms had largely failed. This was partly due to Assad's miscalculations or mistakes, and partly to factors he could not control or change quickly. Chronic socio-economic difficulties remained and new ones appeared. Inefficiency, mismanagement, and corruption in the government, public, and private sectors, illiteracy, poor education, particularly in rural areas, the increasing emigration of professionals, inflation, a growing trade deficit, a high cost of living and shortages of consumer goods were among the problems Syria faced. The financial burden of Syria's involvement in Lebanon since 1976 contributed to worsening economic problems and encouraged corruption and the black market. The emerging class of entrepreneurs and brokers became involved with senior military officers— including Assad's brother [[Rifaat al-Assad|Rifaat]]—in the smuggling of contraband goods from Lebanon, which  affected government revenues and spread corruption among senior governmental officials.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=59-60}}

In the early 1980s, Syria's economy worsened and by mid-1984 the food crisis was so serious that the press was full of complaints. Assad's government sought solution and argued that food shortages could be avoided with careful economic planning. In August the food crisis continued despite the government measures. Syria lacked sugar, bread, flour, wood, iron, and construction equipment, which resulted in soaring prices, long queues, and rampant black marketereering. Smuggling of goods from Lebanon was a common occurrence. Assad's government tried  to combat the smuggling, but encountered problems due to the involvement of Assad's brother Rif'at in the illegal business. In July 1984, the government formed an anti-smuggling squad to control the Lebanon-Syria borders, which proved effective. The Defense Detachment commanded by Rif'at al-Assad played a leading role in the smuggling, and imported $US400,000 worth of goods a day. The anti-smuggling squads seized $US3.8 million worth of goods in its first week.{{sfn|Olmerl|1986|pp=683–684}}

In the early 1990s, the Syrian economy  grew between 5%–7%, exports increased, the balance of trade improved and inflation remained moderate at 15%&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;18%, and oil exports increased. In May 1991, Assad's government liberalized the Syrian economy, which stimulated domestic and foreign private investment. Most of the foreign investors were Arab states of the Persian Gulf, as Western countries still had political and economic issues with Syria. The Gulf states invested in infrastructure and development projects. However, because of the Ba'ath Party's socialist ideology, Assad's government refused to privatize state-owned companies.{{sfn|Zisser|1995|pp=728–729}}

In the mid-1990s, Syria entered another economic crisis due to a recession. In the late 1990s, Syria's economic growth was around 1.5%, which was insufficient as the population growth was between 3% and 3.5%, causing the GDP per capita to be negative. Another symptom of the crisis was statism in foreign trade. Syria's economic crisis occurred at a time of recession in world markets. A drop in the price of oil in 1998 caused a major blow to Syria's economy, but when the oil price rose in 1999, the Syrian economy experienced a partial recovery. In 1999, one of the worst droughts in a century caused further economic woes. It caused a drop of 25%–30% in crop yields compared with 1997 and 1998. Assad's government implemented emergency measures that included loans and compensation to farmers and distribution of fodder free charge in order to save sheep and cattle. However, those steps were limited and had no measurable effect on the economy.{{sfn|Zisser|2002|pp=598–599}}

Assad's government tried to decrease to population growth, which caused economic problems, but this was only marginal successful. One sign of the economic stagnation was Syria's lack of progress in talks with the EU on the signing of an association agreement. The main cause of this failure was the difficulty of Syria meeting EU demands to open the economy and introduce reforms. Marc Pierini, head of the EU delegation in Damascus, said that if the Syrian economy was not modernized it could not benefit from closer ties to the EU. Nevertheless, Assad's government gave civil servants a 20% pay increase on the anniversary of the Corrective Movement which brought Assad to power. The foreign press criticized Syria's reluctance to liberalize its economy. Assad's government refused to modernize the bank system, allow private banks, and open a stock exchange.{{sfn|Zisser|2002|p=599}}

===Personality cult===
[[File:Nasser, Atassi and Assad.jpg|thumb|right|Assad (center) and [[Nureddin al-Atassi]] (left) meeting with Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], 1969. Assad often depicted himself Nasser's successor as "Arab leader".]]
Assad developed a state-sponsored [[cult of personality]] in order to maintain power. Because he wanted to become an Arab leader, he often represented himself as a successor to Egypt's [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], having risen to power in November 1970, a few weeks after Nasser's death. He modelled his presidential system on Nasser's, hailed Nasser for his pan-Arabic leadership, and in public he displayed photographs of Nasser alongside posters of himself.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=57}}

Assad also demonstrated his admiration for [[Saladin|Salah ad-Din]], a Muslim Kurdish leader who in the 12th century unified the Muslim East and defeating the Crusaders in 1187 and subsequently conquered Jerusalem. Assad displayed a large painting of Salah ad-Din's tomb in Damascus in his office and issued a currency bill featuring Salah ad-Din. In his speeches and conversations, Assad frequently hailed Salah ad-Din's successes and his victory over the Crusaders while equating Israel with the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], the Crusaders' state.{{sfn|Reich|1990|pp=57–58}}

Portraits of Assad, often depicting him engaging in heroic activities, were placed in public spaces. He named numerous places and institutions after himself and members of his family. In schools, children were taught to sing songs of adulation about Hafez al-Assad. Teachers began each lesson with the song "Our eternal leader, Hafez al-Assad". Assad was sometimes portrayed with apparently divine properties. Sculptures and portraits depicted him alongside the prophet Mohammad, and after his mother's death, the government produced portraits of her surrounded by a halo. Syrian officials were made to refer to him as 'the sanctified one' (al-Muqaddas).{{sfn|Pipes|1995|pp=15–16}} This strategy was also pursued by Assad's son, Bashar al-Assad.{{sfn|Zisser|2006|p=50}}

===Federation of Arab Republics===

====Alliance with Egypt====
[[File:Sadat Qaddafi Assad 1971.jpg|thumb|left|Assad (sitting on the right side) signing the Federation of Arab Republics in Benghazi, Libya, on 18 April 1971 with President Anwar al-Sadat (sitting left) of Egypt and Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi of Libya (sitting in the centre).]]
Assad's domestic policy encountered serious difficulties and setbacks, and produced new problems and ill feelings, particularly among the Sunni urban classes; the orthodox section of these classes continued to oppose Assad's government for being a sectarian military dictatorship. The continued Muslim opposition to his government and the shortcomings of his socio-economic policies forced Assad's to focus primarily on Syria's regional affairs, namely intra-Arab and anti-Israeli policies. This tendency did not stem only from Assad's expectations to score quick and spectacular gains in his foreign policies at a time when the socio-economic issues of Syria required long-term and painstaking efforts without promise of immediate positive results. In addition to his ambition to turn Syria into a regional power and to himself become a pan-Arab leader, Assad calculated that working for Arab unity and stepping up the struggle against Israel were likely to strengthen his legitimacy and leadership among the various sections of the Syrian population.{{sfn|Reich|1990|pp=56–57}}

Assad's first foreign policy actions were to join the newly established [[Federation of Arab Republics]] along with Egypt, Libya and later Sudan, and to sign a military pact with Egypt. Assad gave a high priority to building a strong military and preparing it for a confrontation with Israel, both for offensive and defensive purposes and to enable him to politically negotiate the return of the Golan Heights from a position of military strength. He allocated up to 70 percent of the annual budget to the military build-up and received large quantities of modern arms from the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=57}}

[[File:Assad Tlass war 1973.jpg|thumb|right|Assad and Defence Minister Mustapha Tlass, during the Arab–Israeli War of 1973, at the Golan front.]]
Once Assad had prepared his army, he was ready to join [[Anwar al-Sadat]]'s Egypt in the [[Yom Kippur War]] in October 1973. Syria was defeated, but while Sadat signed unilateral agreements with Israel, Assad emerged from the war as a national hero in Syria and in other parts of the Middle East. This was due to his decision to go to war against Israel and Syria's subsequent war of attrition against the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] in early 1974. Assad's skill as a cool, proud, tough, and shrewd negotiator in the post war period enabled him to gain the town of [[Kuneitra]] and the respect and admiration of many Arabs. Many of his followers now regarded Assad as the new pan-Arab leader, and a worthy successor of Gamal Nasser.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=57}}

====Early successes, late setbacks====
While promoting himself as a historical leader in the style of Nasser and [[Saladin|Salah ad-Din]], Assad regarded his main goals to be Arab unity and an uncompromising struggle against Israel. The latter goal stemmed partly from Assad's need for legitimacy as an Alawite ruler of Syria who wished to present himself as a genuine Arab and Muslim leader. He had become convinced that Israel presented a severe threat to the integrity of the Arab nation from the Nile to the Euphrates, and that it was his historic mission to defend Arabdom. He regarded the confrontation with Israel as a zero-sum{{clarify|date=June 2013}} struggle, and as a strategist who understood power politics, he had sought to counterbalance Israeli military might with an all-Arab political-military alliance. After Sadat's Egypt left the alliance after the 1973 war, Assad during the middle late 1970s to establish an alternative all-Arab alliance with Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]], or PLO. However, he faced difficulties in reaching an understanding with Ba'athist Iraq, as he did not want to play a secondary role in an Iraqi-Syrian union. Assad returned to his goal to create a Greater Syria union or alliance with Jordan, Lebanon and the PLO. During the period 1975&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;1980, Assad significantly advanced political, military, and economic cooperation with Jordan, extended his control over large parts of Lebanon, and intervened in the [[Lebanese Civil War]], and sustained his strategic alliance with the PLO.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=58}}

Assad also made significant gains in his relations with the superpowers. In 1974, he embarrassed the Soviet Union by negotiating with the United States regarding the military disengagement in the Golan Heights, and in 1976 he ignored Soviet pressure and requests to refrain from invading Lebanon and later to refrain from attacking the PLO and the Lebanese radical forces. Simultaneously, Assad renewed and markedly improved his relations with the United States and made presidents [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Jimmy Carter]] his great admirers.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=58}}

However, neither Assad's international and regional achievements nor his domestic gains lasted long, and he soon showed sign of collapse because of his miscalculation and changing circumstances. His regional politics, which had earned him early political success, now became the main cause of his severe setbacks. Assad's direct intervention in Lebanon was a grave miscalculation, and within two years it turned from being an important asset to a grave liability, both regionally and domestically. Assad's maneuvers among the two main rival factions, playing one against other, alienated both. The PLO, experiencing Assad's blows in 1976, distanced itself from him and consolidated its autonomous infrastructure in southern Lebanon, paradoxically with Israel's indirect assistance, since Israel firmly objected to the deployment of Syrian troops south of the Sidon-Jazzin "red line".{{sfn|Reich|1990|pp=58–59}}

====After the dissolution of the FAR====
[[File:Assad in rage November 1977.jpg|right|thumb|Assad enraged after Anwar Sadat asked him to visit Israel, 1977.]] 
In 1978, the Christian [[Maronites]], fearing Syrian domination, started a guerrilla war against Syrian troops in Beirut and northern Lebanon. Israel's moral support and material aid contributed to the Maronites' autonomy and their resistance to Assad's ''de facto'' occupation of Lebanon. A newly formed [[Likud]] government in Israel developed political and military relations with the Maronite Lebanese Forces and contributed to the undermining of Assad's regional position. Israel welcomed Sadat's initiative in November 1977 and signed the [[Camp David Accords]] with Egypt and the United States in 1978, which was followed by the 1979 [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]].{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=59}}

Assad's regional strategic posture suffered serious blows as Egypt's withdrawal from the all-Arab confrontation against Israel exposed Syria to a growing Israeli threat. Apart from a short-lived rapprochement with the PLO, Assad became increasingly isolated in the region. His brief unity talks with Iraqi leaders collapsed in mid-1979; and with Iraq's 1980 involvement in the [[Iran–Iraq War]], Iraq also effectively withdrew from the conflict against Israel.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=59}} Also in 1979, under the impact of the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty, and in view of Syria's regional predicament, King [[Hussein of Jordan]] withdrew from his association with Assad in favor of a closer relationship with Iraq. Assad's regional strategic position was further damaged when the US Carter administration abandoned its new Syrian-oriented policy in favor of the Egypt-Israeli peace process.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=59}}

===Major powers===

====European Union countries====
{{Main|Syria–European Union relations}}
Under Assad's government, Syria's relations with the countries of the [[European Union]] increased in importance, both economically and politically. Much of Syria's financial aid and foreign trade came from the EU, for example in 1992, 36.8% of Syria's imports and 47.9% of its exports were traded with the EU.{{sfn|Zisser|1995|p=733}} Syria's political relations with the EU served as a counterbalance to the United States.{{sfn|Zisser|1995|p=732}} Assad's Syria also tried to increase the influence of the EU in the Middle East. However, opposition from Israel and the United States prevented the EU's influence in the region.{{sfn|Zisser|1995|pp=732–733}} Syrias ministers visited a number of EU countries either because of the peace process or for economic reasons. Representatives of Netherlands, France, Portugal, and Germany visited Syria.{{sfn|Zisser|1995|p=733}}

During the Lebanese Civil War, Syria's relations with France were tense, but eventually improved. France was still critical of Syria and demanded the reduction of its presence in Lebanon. The issue was resolved when France recognised Syria's central role in the region. In February 1992, French Foreign Minister [[Roland Dumas]] visited Damascus to discuss the Lebanese question and the peace process. In 1992, Syria's relations with Germany, previously cold, improved when Syria was involved in securing the release of two German hostages in Lebanon, which also improved its international image. Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] thanked Assad for his effort. German Foreign Minister [[Hans-Dietrich Genscher]] visited Syria in September 1992 to discuss the improvement of relations between the countries.{{sfn|Zisser|1995|p=733}}

In late 1990s, Syria's relations with EU countries, which were economically significant, continued to slowly improve and allowed the country to gain some maneuverability regarding Israel.  The country's international status was also bolstered.{{sfn|Zisser|2002|p=561}}

====Soviet Union and Russia====
{{Main|Russia–Syria relations}}
In the 1980s, Assad's government established a military cooperation with the Soviet Union. Sophisticiated Soviet arms and military advisers helped the development of the Syrian Army, which raised the tension between Israel and Syria. In November 1983, a Soviet delegation arrived in Damascus to discuss the opening of a [[Russian naval facility in Tartus|Soviet naval base]] in the Syrian city of [[Tartus]]. The countries' relationship encountered problems: Syria had supported Iran during the Iran-Iraq War, while the Soviet Union supported Iraq, and when the rebellion against Yasser Arafat broke out in al-Fatah in 1983, Syria supported the rebels while the Soviet Union supported Arafat. In 1983 the Syrian Foreign Minister [[Abdul Halim Khaddam]] visited Moscow. Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrey Gromyko]] argued that Syria and the Soviet Union must resolve their differences concerning the Palestinian movement as stopping the internal conflict would allow the "anti-Imperialist struggle."{{sfn|Olmert|1986|pp=700–701}}

During the diplomatic crisis between the United States and Syria, which escalated into minor clashes, Syrian counted on Soviet help if war should break out. Vladimir Yukhin, the Soviet ambassador in Damascus, expressed his country's appreciation "for the firm Syrian position in the face of Imperialism and Zionism." The Soviet attitude did not satisfied Syria completely. Assad's government considered entering the [[Warsaw Pact]] to gain Soviet support and to match the United States and Israel. Syria and the Soviet Union signed the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation in October 1980, which was focused on cultural, technical, military, economic, and transport relations. This treaty included joint action in case any of the countries were attacked and forbade both Syria and the Soviet Union from joining any alliance that was against one of the signatories. Syria's efforts to improve the strategic relations with the Soviet Union meant that Syria was not completely satisfied with the current Treaty. Even before the Treaty was signed, the Soviet Union had backed the Arab countries in the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 and the Yom Kippur War of 1973. During the [[1982 Lebanon War]], the Soviet Union kept a policy of low profile. The Soviets did not send arms or exert pressure to end the conflict. This damaged the prestige of the Soviet in the Middle East.{{sfn|Olmert|1986|pp=701–702}}

The strengthening of ties with the Soviet Union, and the increased Soviet military support and political backing were part of the Assad's policy of strategic balance with Israel. In 1983, during the power struggle between Assad's forces and his brother, Rif'at al-Assad, the Soviets supported Hafez al-Assad's Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass and were concerned about Rif'at's bid for power. When the Soviet leader [[Yuri Andropov]] died, Assad did not attended his funeral, but the Syrian official commentary stated that Andropov supported the Soviet-Syrian friendship and that both countries stressed their aspirations for strengthening their ties.{{sfn|Olmert|1986|p=702}}

After 1987, because of internal changes and a political crisis, the Soviet Union was unable to support Syria. This impacted the relationship between the states and Syria reduced its support for the Soviet Union. Changes to the Soviet Middle East policy led to Syria changing its relations with Israel, which resulted in the mass emigration of Jews to Israel and a demand that Syria change its attitude on the conflict with Israel. Alexander Zotov, the Soviet Ambassador, said in November 1989 that Syria's change of foreign policy was necessary, that Syria should cease aspiring for a strategic balance with Israel and settle for "reasonable defensive sufficiency", and that the Soviet-Syrian arms trade would also be changed. The growing Syrian debt to the Soviet Union led to a reduction of the arms trade between the countries, and Syria turned to China and North Korea for its weapons supplies.{{sfn|Zisser|1992|p=656}}

Between 27 and 29 April 1987, Assad, along with the Defense Minister Tlass and Vice President Khaddam, visited the Soviet Union. Assad stressed that Jewish emigration to Israel was an embarrassment to Syria and served to strengthen Israel. Radio Damascus denied claims that the Soviet Union and Syria were becoming distant and stated that the Assad's visit had renewed the momentum in the relations between the countries, consolidating their common view of the Arab–Israeli conflict. The Syrian daily newspaper, ''Tishrin'', stated that after this visit, the relation between the Soviet Union and Syria would be expanded. A few weeks after he returned from Moscow, Assad, in a speech to the National Federation of Syrian Students, said that the Soviet Union remained a firm friend of Syria and the Arabs, and that even though [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and his government were preoccupied with internal affairs, they had not ignored external issues, especially those related to their friends.{{sfn|Zisser|1992|p=657}} In 1990, 44.3% of Syrian exports were traded in the Soviet Union. Just before the collapse of the Soviet Union, the relationship between the countries changed. In April 1991, the Syrian Foreign Minister al-Sharaa visited the Soviet Union, the only visit that year. Soviet Foreign Ministers [[Alexander Bessmertnykh (politician)|Alexander Bessmertnykh]] and [[Boris Pankin]] visited Syria in May and October, but those visits were in connection with the American Middle East peace initiative, accentuating the decline in the status of the Soviet Union in the region.{{sfn|Zisser|1993|pp=673–674}}

The collapse of the Soviet Union on 31 December 1991 marked the end of the main source of Syria's political and military support for more than two decades. In 1992 the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] and Russia were dependent upon the United States and made closer ties with Israel, which meant that Syria was unable to count on their support. Nevertheless, CIS countries were views as limited market and limited source for arms. The absence of high-level contracts between Russia and Syria enabled future development of the relations between the countries. Russia agreed to sell Syria arms under previous contracts with the Soviet Union and they demanded payment of Syria's US$10–12 billion debt. Syria refused to do so, claiming that Russia was not a successor state of the Soviet Union, but later agreed to pay part of the debt by exporting citrus fruit worth $US800 million.{{sfn|Zisser|1995|p=733}}

Like other Arab countries, Syria worked to develop good relations with Muslim former Soviet countries. Syrian Foreign Minister [[Farouk al-Sharaa]] visited Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Azerbaijan with limited results. At the same time, Syria established good relations with [[Armenia]] which has to be placed in the context of Syria's demographic composition which includes a large [[Armenians in Syria|Armenian community]].{{sfn|Zisser|1995|p=733}}

On 6 July 1999, Assad visited Moscow. The visit was originally planned for March but Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] was visiting Moscow at the same time so Assad's visit was postponed. Assad finalized an arms deal worth $2 billion, and after the visit both sides stated that they would strengthen their trade ties. Assad commented upon Russia's growing importance, stating that he welcomed Russia's strengthening and hoped that their role would be more clearly and openly expressed. The United States warned Russia not to trade arms to Syria, but Russia stated that it would not yield to American threats.{{sfn|Zisser|2002|p=561}}

====United States====
{{Main|Syria–United States relations}}
[[File:NixonAssad.jpg|thumb|Assad greets President Nixon on his arrival at Damascus airport in 1974]]
In 1980s, the situation in Lebanon became a major problem between Assad's government and the United States. In October 1983, the headquarters of the American and French troops of the [[Multinational Force in Lebanon]] (MNF), was demolished in an suicide attack. Around 200 Americans were killed. Syria's ambassador in the US disclaimed any Syria's involvement but US officials thought differently so Congress passed an emergency bill canceling economic aid previously approved for Syria. It was later reported that Syria had provided support for the attack. Around 800 Shia extremists had been trained in Syria and Assad's cousin Adnan al-Assad had supervised the preparations for the attack. Syria decided to resist American and French if attacked. Syria's Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass said that Syria would launch suicide attacks on the American Sixth Fleet. In December 1983, when American planes pounded Syrian positions in Biqa' valley, the Syrian air-defense system fought back. Two American airplanes were destroyed and one pilot was taken prisoner of war. Just before the attack, Israel's Prime Minister had visited Washington; Syria linked the American attack with the visit.{{sfn|Olmert|1988|p=703}}

In the 1990s, Syria maintained good relations with the United States, but several problems prevented them establishing a friendly relationship. In April 1992, Syria allowed Jews to emigrate to Israel, which was welcomed by the [[George H. W. Bush|Bush]] administration.{{sfn|Zisser|pp=729–730}} Syria also showed its commitment to the peace process and requested US to take a more active part. However, relations between the countries were still characterized by mutual distrust and differences of opinion on key issues.{{sfn|Zisser|1995|p=730}}

The US accused Syria of patronizing terrorist organizations. Despite Syria's efforts to portray itself as having dissociated itself from these groups, it was not removed from the list of countries sponsoring terrorist organizations that appeared in annual US Department report on "Patterns of Global Terrorism". In 1991, Syria was suspected of involvement in the destruction of [[Pan Am Flight 103]] over [[Lockerbie]] in Scotland. The US government absolved Syria of responsibility but the US media continued to portray Syria as a suspect. Syria denied any involvement and protested its inclusion on the "Patterns of Global Terrorism" list. Assad's government continued to patronage organizations that operated against Israel, including [[Hezbollah]], the [[Popular Front for Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP), and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command]] (PFLP-GC).{{sfn|Zisser|1995|p=730}}

===Region===

====Egypt====
{{Main|Egypt–Syria relations}}
Relations between Egypt in Syria were renewed in December 1989. In the 1990s, the countries enjoyed good relations with each other, as did their respective presidents, [[Hosni Mubarak]] and Assad. Syria tried to make Egypt its advocate to the United States and Israel, while Egypt tried to convince Syria to continue with the peace process. Syria also tried in vain to mediate between Egypt and Iran, a process mainly undertaken by Syrian Foreign Minister al-Sharaa. Relations between Egypt in Syria were not as good on a military or economic level.{{sfn|Zisser|1995|p=734}}In 1999 relations between the countries became strained because of differences over the peace process. Assad and Mubarak met only once that year; during the past decade they had met every few months. Syria opposed Egypt's proposal to convene a summit of Arabic countries negotiating with Israel, as Syria was unwilling to be pressured into a dialog with Yaser Arafat. Later, Syria accused Egypt of seeking to promote negotiations with the Palestinians at Syrian expense.{{sfn|Zisser|2002|p=562}}

====Israel====
{{Main|Israel–Syria relations}}
Assad's foreign policy was largely shaped by Syria's attitude toward Israel. During his presidency, Syria played a major role in the 1973 Arab–Israeli war, which was presented by the Assad's government as a victory, although by the end of the war the Israeli army had invaded large areas of Syria and taken up positions {{convert|40|km}} from Damascus. Syria later regained some territory that had been occupied in 1967 in the peace negotiations headed by [[Henry Kissinger]]. The Syrian government refused to recognise the State of Israel and referred to it as the "Zionist Entity." In the mid-1990s, Assad moderated his country's policy towards Israel as the loss of Soviet support altered the balance of power in the Middle East. Under pressure from the United States, Assad engaged in negotiations on the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, but these talks failed. Assad believed that what constituted Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza were an integral part of southern Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.danielpipes.org/174/palestine-for-the-syrians |title = Palestine for the Syrians? |author = Daniel Pipes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/64972/fouad-ajami/the-ways-of-syria?page=2 |title = The Ways of Syria – Foreign Affairs |author = Fouad Ajami |date = May–June 2009 |accessdate = 10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Assad signed Syria's Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Country Studies/68"&gt; {{cite web |url = http://countrystudies.us/syria/68.htm |title = Relations with the Soviet Union |author = Thomas Collelo, ed.|work =  Syria: A Country Study. | location = Washington | publisher = GPO for the Library of Congress |year = 1987 |accessdate = 8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to develop his new doctrine of Strategic Balance, which he had initiated the previous year. Aiming primarily at confronting Israel single-handedly, this doctrine engendered fresh intra-Arab policies and was directed toward consolidating Assad's domestic front, which had suffered setbacks since 1977.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=59}}

Israel was the main target of Assad's terrorist and guerrilla operations in both Lebanon and Europe. Attempts to bomb an El-Al airliner in London in April 1986 and in Madrid in June 1986 were part of an attrition campaign that Assad had been directing against Israel to damage its economy, morale, and social fabric and weaken its military capacity. This campaign of attrition was an auxiliary tactic in Assad's policy of strategic balance with Israel developed by Assad in the late 1970s, when Syria was largely isolated in the region and exposed to a potential Israeli threat. With the help of the Soviet Union, Assad built a large military equipped with modern tanks, airplanes and long-range ground-to-ground missiles capable of launching chemical warheads into most Israeli cities.{{sfn|Reich|1990|pp=61–62}}

Although Assad was still far from achieving a strategic balance with Israel, his government reached military parity in quantitative terms. This enabled him to deter Israel from attacking Syria and in the event of war, to cause heavy losses to Israel. It also gave him an option to retake the Golan Heights by a surprise attack. Assad's enormous military power also enabled him to sustain some of his major political gains in the region and at home. However, he was not content with his military buildup, and continued to also employ his skills as a first-rate strategist and manipulator in order to advance his prime regional policy to gain support from all Arabs for his assumed role as a leader of the Arab struggle against Israel, while further isolating Egypt and counterbalancing the growing power of Iraq, Syria's major Arab rivals in the region.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=62}}

Although Syria had good relations with the Soviet Union, Assad began to turn towards the West in late-1980s, having seen how Iraq had benefited during its war with Iran. He agreed to join the United States-led coalition against Iraq in the [[Gulf War]] in 1991. He continued to regard Israel as major regional enemy. At the end of the 1991 Middle East peace conference, Assad insisted on a "land for peace" deal, demanding Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights. Assad regarded the September 1993 Israeli accord with the PLO—which ended the ''[[First Intifada|first intifada]]'' (resistance) in the Occupied Territories without giving the Palestinians any substantial gains—and the increasingly friendly relationship between Israel and Jordan as set-backs. {{sfn|Seddon|2004|p=76}}

====Iran====
{{Main|Iran–Syria relations}}
In 1978 when [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] was forced to leave Iraq where he had been in exile since 1963, Assad suggested him refuge in Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Badran|first=Tony|title=Syriana|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/36751/syriana|work=Tablet|accessdate=4 August 2013|date=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assad regarded the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution in Iran]] in February 1979 as an opportunity to further implement his policies. Although he was against any Islamic movement, but as the Iranian one was a Shia movement he found an ally in the new Iranian government. The new government of Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran promptly abolished Iran's ties with Israel and Egypt and turned hostile towards these states. Assad established an alliance with Iran, whose political and social principles — except those concerning Israel and the United States — were dramatically opposed to Ba'athist doctrines.  Assad consistently extended military and diplomatic assistance to Iran during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] in order to secure legitimacy and support for his rule in Syria and his policies in Lebanon. He used the potential threat from Iran to manipulate Arab states in the [[Persian Gulf]] into continuing their financial and diplomatic support for Syria, weakening and possibly toppling the Iraqi government, and subsequently employing Iraq and Iran for "strategic depth" and as allies in Syria's confrontation with Israel, thus emerging as leader of the all-Arab struggle against Israel. Assad repeated that the Iran–Iraq war should not have occurred since it was waged against a potential ally of the Arabs and diverted the Arabs' attention, resources, and efforts from their real enemy, Israel. According to Assad, most Arab countries had been wrongly led to support Iraq in an unnecessary war against Iran, rather than support Syria in its vital national-historical struggle against Israel.{{sfn|Reich|1990|pp=62–63}}

However, except for securing Arab financial support and verbal commitments, and obtaining large quantities of free and discounted Iranian oil, Assad failed to achieve the goals of his Gulf strategy; instead it further worsened Syria's regional position. The growing Iranian threat to Iraq, which Assad indirectly fueled, brought Egypt back to the Arab cause and many Arabs agreed with Egypt's peace treaty with Israel. A new alliance developed between Egypt and Iraq, Syria became further isolated, and the Iraqi government — whose leaders developed feelings of hatred and revenge towards Assad — consolidated itself.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=63}} Syria's relationship with Iran during the war was under pressure. Iran's threats to take Iraqi territory caused Syria to not object the loss of Arab territory. In early 1986, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa said that Iran had confirmed that Iraqi territory would not be taken and al-Sharaa called Iran's refusal to end the war "crazy". Soon afterwards, Iran occupied the [[Faw Peninsula]] in Iraq, damaging Syria's credibility. Another blow was Iran's offensive on [[Basra]] in late 1986 and early 1987. Between May and June 1986, Jordan and Saudi Arabia mediated between the Syrian and Iraqi Ba'ath parties. Mediation was arranged due to Iran's threats to cut off oil supplies to Syria, as Syria was unable to pay Iran. Assad said that he was also interested in a dialog with Iraq. Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries tried to persuade Assad to reach an agreement with Iraq and reopen its pipeline to the Mediterranean, which traverses Syria.{{sfn|Olmert|1988|p=616}}

====Iraq====

Even though Iraq was ruled by another [[Ba'ath Party (Baghdad)|branch of the Ba'ath Party]], Assad's relations with [[Saddam Hussein]] were extremely strained, mainly because of Assad's support for Iran during the Iraq-Iran war, which Saddam was unable to forgive.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}However, Saddam had despatched Iraqi army tanks to [[Damascus]] in order to prevent the Israeli Defence Forces from taking control of the city. This entry of the Iraq, then considered the leading Arab nation both economically as well as militarily, into Syria marks the first and, to date, only time in Syrian history where a foreign Arab army has entered its land. Assad had supported Iran in the war, and Iran found another ally in the Kurds in Iraq, who assisted Iran's offensive at the northern Iraq.

[[Massoud Barzani]], a Kurdish leader, hoped that Khomeini would give the territory to the Kurds, but Khomeini decided to incorporate it into the [[Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq]]. Barzani was not satisfied so he aligned with Assad's Syria, while Assad was also patronizing [[Jalal Talabani]].{{sfn|Pelletière|2007|p=70}} Talabani had lived in Syria since the 1970s and Assad believed he could benefit from his ties with Syria. Talabani stated that he would not forget the support given to him by Assad.{{sfn|Barkey|Lasensky|Marr|Hamilton|2011|p=27}} This was one of Assad's efforts to expand Syria's zone of influence to Iraq. By receiving Barzani, Assad gained the support of Kurds, thus decreasing Iran's chances to expand its influence over Iraq. However, after the end of the Iran-Iraq War, the Iraqi Kurds were still in close relations with Iran.{{sfn|Pelletière|2007|p=70}}

During the [[Islamist uprising in Syria]], the Iraqi government had provided arms as well as logistical support to the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], particularly during the [[Hama massacre]].

Assad also participated in the coalition formed to force Iraq from Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf War; however Syria-Iraq relations started to improve in 1997 and 1998{{sfn|Post|George|2004|p=231}} when Israel started to develop a strategic partnership with Turkey.{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2008|p=169}}

====Jordan====
{{Main|Jordan–Syria relations}}
Assad had cold relations with Jordan. Syria under Assad had long history of attempts to destabilize King Hussein's regime and a regular onslaught of official insults emanated from Damascus towards [[Amman]].{{sfn|Schenker|2003|p=11}} Both countries supported the other's opposition forces in order to destabilize each other. In 1979's Islamic uprising in Syria, Jordan supported the Muslim Brotherhood.{{sfn|Milton-Edwards|2009|p=101}} Assad accused King Hussein of supporting them,{{sfn|Korany|Dessounki|2010|p=272}}defeated the Islamists and sent Syrian troops to the Jordanian border. In December 1980, some Arab newspapers reported that Syrian jets attacked Muslim Brotherhood bases in Jordan. Saudi Arabia mediated in order to calm the two countries. Syria's hostility towards Jordan was partly fueled by Jordan's good relationship with Iraq.{{sfn|Milton-Edwards|2009|pp=101–102}} During the Iraq-Iran War, Syria and Jordan supported different sides.{{sfn|Schenker|2003|p=11}} Not even the threat of war with Syria prevented King Hussein from supporting Iraq; however the rest of the [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]] did the same.{{sfn|Milton-Edwards|2009|p=102}} In October 1998, Syria's Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass stated that "there is no such country as Jordan. Jordan was merely south Syria".{{sfn|Schenker|2003|p=11}} However, when [[King Hussein]]  died in February 1999, Assad attended his funeral, after which relations between Syria and Jordan started to improve. Hussein's successor, [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah]] visited Syria in April 1999, which was described as a "turning point" in the relationship between two countries.{{sfn|Korany|Dessounki|2010|p=272}}

====Lebanon====
{{Main|Lebanon–Syria relations|Syrian occupation of Lebanon}}
Syria deployed troops to Lebanon in 1976 during the Lebanese Civil War as part of the [[Arab Deterrent Force]]. Military intervention had been requested by the [[President of Lebanon|Lebanese President]] [[Suleiman Frangieh]], as Lebanese Christian fears had been greatly exacerbated by the [[Damour massacre]]. Syria responded by ending its prior affiliation with the Palestinian [[Rejectionist Front]] and began supporting the Maronite-dominated government.&lt;ref&gt;Charles D. Smith, ''Palestine and the Arab Israeli Conflict'', p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Hafez al-Assad received strong criticism and pressure from across the Arab world for his involvement in the [[Tel al-Zaatar massacre]] of Palestinians - this criticism, as well as the internal dissent it caused as an Alawite ruler in a majority Sunni country, led to a cease-fire in his war on the Palestinian militia forces inside Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;''Faces of Lebanon: sects, wars, and global extensions'', William W. Harris, (NY 1997), pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1976 diplomatic cable released by [[WikiLeaks]], a US diplomat stated "if I got nothing else from my meeting with [[Suleiman Frangieh|Frangie]], [[Chamoun]] and [[Amine Gemayel|Gemayel]], it is their clear, unequivocal and unmistakable belief that their principal hope for saving Christian necks is Syria. They sound like Assad is the latest incarnation of the [[Crusaders]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1976BEIRUT02937_b.html|title=Cable: 1976BEIRUT02937_b|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assad used terrorism and intimidation to extend his control over Lebanon.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=61}} Jumblatt was assassinated in 1977, and Syria was accused of ordering it, and in 1982 Syrian assassins killed [[Bachir Gemayel]], the pro-Israeli Lebanese President, both of whom had resisted Assad's attempts to dominate Lebanon.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=61}} Using similar tactics, Assad brought about the abolition of the 1983 Lebanon–Israel agreement, and through guerrilla warfare carried out by proxy in 1985, Assad indirectly caused the Israeli Defense Forces to withdraw to southern Lebanon.{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=61}} Terrorism against Palestinians and Jordanian targets in the mid-1980s contributed to thwart the rapprochement between King Hussein of Jordan and the PLO and the slowing down of  Jordanian-Israeli political cooperation in the [[West Bank]].{{sfn|Reich|1990|p=61}}

The Syrian occupation ended in 2005, due to UN resolution 1559, after the [[Rafiq Hariri]] assassination and the 14 March protests.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

====Libya====
[[File:Gaddafi-Boumedienne-Assad-1977-Tripolis.jpg|thumb|right|Libyan leader al-Gaddafi, Algerian president Boumedienne and Syrian President Assad at the Front summit in Tripoli, December 1977.]]
Throughout 1970, Libya's leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and Egypt's President Sadat were involved in the negotiations about the union between Egypt and Libya. Assad — at the time Lieutenant General — expanded the negotiations on Syria{{sfn|Metz|2004|p=71}} in September 1970 when in Libya.{{sfn|Otman|Karlberg|2007|p=35}} In April 1971, the three leaders announced the Federation of Arab Republics between Libya, Syria, and Egypt.{{sfn|Metz|2004|p=71}} When the Yom Kippur War started in 1973, Libya opposed its direction and criticized Egypt and Syria for restricted objectives. Libya was also unhappy with being sidelined. Nevertheless, Libya supported the war and had stationed troops in Egypt before it began. When the Arab countries lost the war and ceasefire negotiations started, Gaddafi was infuriated. After the war Gaddafi criticized Sadat and Assad for not consulting him before the war.{{sfn|Otman|Karlberg|2007|p=37}} Egypt's marginalization of Libya and acceptance of the Camp David accords led Libya to adopt a more hostile stance against Egypt. Eventually, Libya improved its relations with Syria, which also opposed Egypt after the Camp David accords.{{sfn|Otman|Karlberg|2007|p=35}}

Gaddafi tried to expand the Arab unity to states to the west of Libya. After he failed in 1974 to form a union with Tunisia and Egypt, Gaddafi again turned to Assad. In September 1980, Assad agreed to enter another union with Libya, which occurred when both countries were diplomatically isolated. As part of the agreement, Libya paid the Syrian debt of US$1 billion owned to the Soviet Union for weapons. The union confounded Gaddafi's pan-Arab ambitions. In the same month the union was formed, the Iran-Iraq War broke out and Syria and Libya were the only Arab states to support Iran.{{sfn|Metz|2004|p=74}}

In 1992, during the crisis between Libya and the West, despite long years of friendship between Assad and Gaddafi, Syria refrained from any non-verbal support for Libya. In order to get more support from Syria, Gaddafi sent a delegation to Damascus in January 1992, headed by Colonel Mustafa al-Kharubi. In March, while Assad was visiting Egypt, he met with a Libyan representative to the [[Arab League]]. Later in the same month, Abu Zayd 'Umar Durd, secretary of the Libyan General People's Committees, also visited Damascus. However, Syria could do no more than to denounce the UN's Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on Libya, condemning it as unjustified provocation in view of what Syria considered to be a double standard applied by the international community toward Libya and Israel. Once the sanctions were in force on 15 April, Syria announced that it would violate the embargo and maintain air contacts with Libya. However, American pressure and Syria's technical inability to send flights to Libya caused them to reverse the decision.{{sfn|Zisser|1995|p=738}}

====Turkey====
{{Main|Syria–Turkey relations}}
During Assad's presidency, Syria's relations with Turkey were tense. The problem of [[Hatay]] had existed since its annexation by Turkey in 1939. A more important issue between the countries was water supply and Syria's support to the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) and the [[Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia]] (ASALA). Turkey was a member of [[NATO]], while Syria was allied to the Soviet Union; the [[Cold War]] was a guarantor to the ''status quo''. After the Cold War ended, the issue of Hatay came to prominence.{{sfn|Rabo|Utas|2006|pp=92–93}}

Assad offered help to the PKK enabled it to receive training in the [[Beqaa Valley|Beka'a' Valley]] in Lebanon. [[Abdullah Öcalan]], one of the founders of the PKK, openly used his villa in Damascus as a base for operations. Turkey threatened to cut off all water supplies to Syria.{{sfn|Phillips|2009|pp=129–130}} However, when the Turkish Prime Minister or President sent a formal letter to the Syrian leadership requesting it to stop supporting the PKK, Assad ignored them. At that time, Turkey could not attack Syria due to its low military capacity near the Syrian border, and advised the European NATO members to avoid becoming involved in Middle East conflicts in order to avoid escalating the West's conflict with the Warsaw Pact states, since Syria had good relations with the Soviet Union. However, after the end of the Cold War, Turkish military concentration on the Syrian border increased.{{sfn|Kibaroğlu|Kibaroğlu|Halman|2009|p=73}} In mid-1998, Turkey threatened Syria with military action because of Syrian aid to Öcalan,{{sfn|Radu|2003|p=152}} and in October it gave Syria an ultimatum.{{sfn|Kibaroğlu|Kibaroğlu|Halman|2009|p=73}} Assad was aware of the possible consequences of Syria's continuing support to the PKK. Turkey was militarily powerful while Syria had lost the support of the Soviet Union. The Russian Federation was not willing to help; neither was it capable of taking strong measures against Turkey.{{sfn|Kibaroğlu|Kibaroğlu|Halman|2009|p=73}} Facing a real threat of military confrontation with Turkey, Syria signed the Adana Memorandum in October 1998, which designated the PKK as a terrorist organization and required Syria to evict it from its territory.{{sfn|Phillips|2009|p=129-130}} After the PKK was dissolved in Syria, Turkish-Syrian political relations improved considerably, but issues such as water supplies from the [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]] rivers and Hatay remained unsolved.{{sfn|Kibaroğlu|Kibaroğlu|Halman|2009|p=73}}

'''Rigsrevisionen''' is the national [[audit]] agency of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]] and an independent institution of the [[Folketing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.dk/Folketinget/Folketingets_institutioner/Rigsrevisionen.aspx|accessdate=2011-04-17|title=Folketinget - Rigsrevisionen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is responsible for auditing the expenditure of Danish central government, and also [[Public sector|public-sector]] bodies in which the government has an economic interest, such as [[hospital]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regioner.dk/Aktuelt/Nyheder/2010/December/Rigsrevisionen+anerkender+2009+som+et+s%C3%A6rligt+%C3%A5r.aspx|accessdate=2011-04-17|title=Regioner - Rigsrevisionen anerkender 2009 som et særligt år}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Danish Security and Intelligence Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pet.dk/Kontrol/Rigsrevisionen.aspx|accessdate=2011-04-17|title=PET: Rigsrevisionens kontrol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Rigsrevision made serious criticisms of the [[Royal Danish Navy]]'s finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/debat/kroniker/ECE1344734/hvad-skal-vi-med-forsvaret/|accessdate=14 August 2011|title=Hvad skal vi med forsvaret?|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auditing is not limited to narrow financial terms, such as investigating the stability of the banking system;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Penge/2011/01/28/065202.htm|accessdate=2011-04-17|title=Rigsrevisionen kulegraver Finansiel Stabilitet}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also checks that public services provide value for taxpayers' money in a more general sense. For instance, in 2011, Rigsrevisionen launched an investigation into the ability of water suppliers and the environment ministry to protect consumers from traces of herbicides in drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ing.dk/artikel/115997-rigsrevisionen-undersoeger-statens-evne-til-at-passe-paa-drikkevandet|accessdate=2011-04-17|title=Rigsrevisionen undersøger statens evne til at passe på drikkevandet | publisher =Ingeniøren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rigsrevisionen was part of the Economy ministry from 1971 to 1991.

The '''Shan United Revolutionary Army''' ({{lang-my|ရှမ်းပြည်နယ်တပ်ပေါင်းစုတော်လှန်ရေးတပ်မတော်}}; [[Abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''SURA'''), was a [[Shan people|Shan]] [[Insurgency|insurgent group]] in [[Myanmar]] (Burma), led by several drug warlords such as [[Khun Sa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=112&amp;regionSelect=7-Eastern_Asia#,|title=Uppsala Conflict Encyclopedia, Myanmar (Burma)|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The SURA had multiple factions, such as the "Tai Revolutionary Council" led by [[Moh Heng]], a group which would merge in 1985 with Khun Sa's [[Shan United Army]] (SUA)&lt;ref name="GS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/sua.htm|title=Shan United Army (SUA) - Mong Tai Army (MTA)|work=GlobalSecurity|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to create the [[Mong Tai Army]] with its base of operations in [[Homong]].&lt;ref name="F&amp;D"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Myanmar/sub5_5g/entry-3078.html|title=Golden Triangle drug Lords: Khun Sa, Lo Hsing Han, Miss Hairy Legs and the Wa State Army|work=Facts and Details|accessdate=26 May 2016}}; [[Bertil Lintner]], in Asia Online; November 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LclscNCTz9oC&amp;pg=PA870&amp;lpg=PA870&amp;dq=%22Shan+State+National+Army%22+MTA&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ym-nYd0e02&amp;sig=QV59FgiypPy07ZYlP0e6_ZDONgI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u2MSVJSODc6hugTjjYGwDA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Shan%20State%20National%20Army%22%20MTA&amp;f=false|title=''The Far East and Australasia 2003'', p. 870|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 most of its soldiers disarmed, but a group of 800 soldiers were integrated into the newly formed [[Shan State Army - South]] by [[Yawd Serk]].

'''"Stauning or Chaos"''' ([[Danish language|Danish]] ''Stauning eller Kaos'') is a famous Danish election slogan from the [[Danish Folketing election, 1935|parliamentary election of 1935]], in which [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrat]] [[Thorvald Stauning]] campaigned for re-election. The Social Democrats won the election winning 68 out of 149 seats, and Stauning continued on to be the second-longest serving [[List of Prime Ministers of Denmark|Prime Minister]] in Danish history.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Conserva. 2006.

The campaign with its warning against "chaos", interpreted as the threat of [[fascism]], is an example of the emotional and activist campaign style used by the major political parties in Denmark in the 1920s and 1930s, often capitalizing on the public fear of the perceived threats of radical ideologies such as fascism and [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;John T. Lauridsen. 2000. NAZISTISK PLAKATPROPAGANDA I DANMARK 1930-45 En dokumentation. Fund og Forskning, Bind 39 (2000)[http://e-tidsskrifter.dk/ojs/index.php/fundogforskning/article/view/1369/2218]

The '''Tigers Militia''' ([[Arabic Language|Arabic]]: نمور الأحرار, [[Romanization of Arabic|transliterated]]: ''Numūr'' or ''Al-Noumour''), also known as '''NLP Tigers''' or '''Tigers of the Liberals''' ([[Arabic Language|Arabic]]: ''Numur al-Ahrar'') and '''PNL "Lionceaux"''' in [[French language|French]], was the military wing of the [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberal Party]] (NLP) during the [[Lebanese Civil War]].

== Origins ==
The NLP militia was first raised in October 1968 by [[Camille Chamoun]] at his own home town of Es-Sa'adiyat, originally under the title '''Brigade of the Lebanese Tigers – BLT''' ([[Arabic]]: ''Katibat al-Numur al-Lubnaniyya'') or '''Brigade des Lionceaux Libanais (BLL)''' in [[French language|French]], allegedly taken from his middle name, ''Nimr'' – meaning "Tiger" in Arabic. Initially just 500-men strong,&lt;ref&gt;McGowan, Roberts, Abu Khalil, and Scott Mason, ''Lebanon: a country study'' (1989), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; the BLT was organized, trained, and led by the 'defence secretary' of the NLP [[Naim Berdkan]]; after his death in action in January 1976, he was succeeded by [[Dany Chamoun]], Camille Chamoun's younger son.

Initially allocated in the NLP party offices' at [[Sodeco Square]] in the Nasra (Nazareth) neighbourhood of the [[Achrafieh]] quarter in Beirut, the Tigers' military HQ was relocated in 1978 to [[Safra, Lebanon|Safra]], a boat marina and tourist beach resort located 25&amp;nbsp;km north of the Lebanese capital in the [[Keserwan District]], where it remained until the militia's dissolution.

== Structure and organization ==

Under the command of [[Dany Chamoun]], the Tigers had become by 1978 the second largest militia force in the [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] [[Lebanese Front]], and although the Chamouns never achieved with their own militia the same level of organizational efficiency displayed by the rival [[Kataeb Party|Phalange]]' [[Kataeb Regulatory Forces]] militia, they were nonetheless capable of aligning 3,500 men and women, though other sources list a total of 4,000,&lt;ref&gt;Makdisi and Sadaka, ''The Lebanese Civil War, 1975-1990'' (2003), p. 44, Table 1: War Period Militias.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;El-Kazen, ''The Breakdown of the State in Lebanon'' (2000), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; which included civilian recruits and deserters from the [[Lebanese Army]]. However, other unconfirmed sources advance an even higher number, about 15,000.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Their 500 full-time fighters and 3,000 part-time reservists were organized into [[armoured warfare|armoured]], '[[commando]]', [[infantry]], [[artillery]], [[Signals (military)|signals]], [[medical]], [[logistics]] and [[military police]] branches.
Their chain of command was predominantly Maronite, though the rank-and-file were drawn from the [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]], [[Greek Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek-Orthodox]], [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]], and [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shi'ite]] militants of the NLP and trained in-country at clandestine facilities; first set up by the NLP in 1966 these training centres were located at [[Naas, Lebanon|Naas]] in the [[Matn District]], [[Es-Saadiyat]] in the [[Iqlim al-Kharrub]] coastal enclave south of [[Beirut]] and at [[Adma wa Dafneh|Adma]] in the northern mountainous [[Keserwan District]].

NLP militia units operated mainly in [[East Beirut]], the [[Jbeil District|Jbeil]], [[Matn District|Matn]] and [[Keserwan District]]s and [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], but also had a presence at [[Zahlé]] in the [[Beqaa valley]], at the south in the Iqlim al-Kharrub, the [[Aley District]] and the [[Jabal Amel]],&lt;ref&gt;Deeb, ''The Lebanese Civil War'' (1980), pp. 25-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabinovich, ''The War for Lebanon'' (1989), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; where their local militants – after merging with other Christian, [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shia Muslim]] and [[Druze people in Lebanon|Druze]] militias – played a key part in the formation on 21 October 1976 of the Israeli-backed informal "Army for the Defense of South Lebanon" or ADSL ([[French language|French]]: ''Armée de Défense du Liban-Sud'' or ADLS),&lt;ref&gt;Hokayem, ''L'armée libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du président de la République (1975-1985)'' (2012), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; later to become known as the "Free Lebanese Army" (FLA), the predecessor of the [[South Lebanon Army]] (SLA).&lt;ref&gt;[https://histoiredelarmeelibanaise.wordpress.com/2012/06/17/chamussy-rene-chronique-dune-guerre-le-liban-1975-1977-ed-desclee-1978/ Chamussy (René) – Chronique d'une guerre: Le Liban 1975-1977 – éd. Desclée – 1978]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weapons and equipment==
The Tigers received covert support not only from the [[Lebanese Army]] in the pre-war years, but also from the [[United States]], [[Iran]], [[Jordan]] and [[Egypt]] since 1973, followed by [[Israel]] and [[Syria]] in 1976-77, who provided weapons and heavy equipment.  In addition, the collapse of the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] (LAF) and the [[Internal Security Forces]] (ISF) in January 1976, coupled by the massive influx of Israeli military aid, allowed NLP militia units to re-equip themselves with modern small-arms, sophisticated mobile communications equipment,&lt;ref&gt;Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, ''Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas'' (1979), pp. 42-45.&lt;/ref&gt; and military vehicles seized from LAF barracks and ISF Police stations or supplied by the Israelis. Adittional weapons and other military equipments were procured in the international [[black market]].

The Tigers' own armoured corps was created in early 1976, equipped with an assortment of ex-[[Lebanese Army]] [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] and [[AMX-13]] [[light tanks]], [[Charioteer tank]]s, [[M42 Duster]] [[Self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon|SPAAG]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Kassis, ''30 Years of Military Vehicles in Lebanon'' (2003), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; [[M113 armored personnel carrier|M113]] and [[Panhard M3|Panhard M3 VTT]]&lt;ref&gt;Kassis, ''30 Years of Military Vehicles in Lebanon'' (2003), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kassis, ''Véhicules Militaires au Liban/Military Vehicles in Lebanon'' (2012), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armoured personnel carrier]]s, [[Bravia Chaimite|Bravia V-200 Chaimite]] [[Armoured car (military)|armoured car]]s, [[T17 (armored car)|Staghound armoured car]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Ludovic Fortin, ''T17E1 Staghound Armored Car – Le char sur roues'', Trucks &amp; Tracks Magazine, December 2007 - January 2008 issue, pp. 48-67.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Panhard AML|Panhard AML-90]] [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]],&lt;ref&gt;Hamizrachi, ''The Emergence of South Lebanon Security Belt'' (1984), pp. 55-89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Badran, ''Lebanon: Liberation, Conflict, and Crisis'' (2010), pp. 50-52.&lt;/ref&gt; bolstered by twenty Israeli-supplied [[Super Sherman|M50 Super Sherman]] Tanks,&lt;ref&gt;Kassis, ''Véhicules Militaires au Liban/Military Vehicles in Lebanon'' (2012), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; [[M3 Half-track|M3/M9 Zahlam half-track]]s and [[BTR-152]] APCs.

The NLP militia also raised a mechanized force of [[gun truck]]s or '[[Technical (vehicle)|technicals]]', comprising [[M151 1/4-ton 4x4 utility truck|M151A1]] and [[Willys M38A1|Willys M38A1 MD jeeps]],&lt;ref&gt;Kassis, ''30 Years of Military Vehicles in Lebanon'' (2003), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Land Rover Series|Land-Rover series II-III]],&lt;ref&gt;Kassis, ''30 Years of Military Vehicles in Lebanon'' (2003), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kassis, ''Véhicules Militaires au Liban/Military Vehicles in Lebanon'' (2012), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toyota Land Cruiser (J40)]], [[Toyota Land Cruiser (J45)]], [[Peugeot 404]], [[Dodge Power Wagon|Dodge Power Wagon W200]], [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] Sierra Custom K25/K30, Chevrolet C-10 Cheyenne and Chevrolet C-20 Scottsdale light pickups, and [[Toyota Dyna|Toyota Dyna U10-series trucks]] fitted with [[heavy machine guns]], [[recoilless rifles]], and [[anti-aircraft]] [[autocannons]].  For logistical support, the Tigers relied on [[Range Rover|Range Rover 1st generation]] and [[Toyota Land Cruiser (J42)]] [[hardtop]] light pickups, [[Toyota Dyna|Toyota U10-series route vans (minibus)]],&lt;ref&gt;Kassis, ''Véhicules Militaires au Liban/Military Vehicles in Lebanon'' (2012), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Chevrolet Series 50 light-duty, Dodge F600 medium-duty and [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] C7500 heavy-duty cargo trucks; a number of [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen Type 2 Transporter minibuses]] were used as military ambulances.

===Artillery===
They also fielded a powerful artillery corps equipped with British [[Ordnance QF 25-pounder|QF Mk III 25-Pounder field gun]]s, French [[Obusier de 155 mm Modèle 50|Mle 1950 BF-50 155mm howitzer]]s, Soviet [[130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46)|M1954 (M-46) 130mm towed field gun]]s, Soviet [[AZP S-60|AZP S-60 57mm anti-aircraft gun]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, ''Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas'' (1979), pp. 16-21, 32-36, 52; Appendix A, A-10, Table 3; Appendix D, D-5.&lt;/ref&gt; British [[Bofors 40 mm|Bofors 40mm L/60 anti-aircraft guns]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://osw.zone/paint-weathering-diorama/vallejo-colors/135-btr-152-apc-armed-with-bofors-40-mm-gunnlp-tigers-militialebanon1976-by/ 1/35 Model Photos of a Lebanese Tigers Militia AA QF Bofors 40mm gun mounted on a BTR-152 APC, c.1976.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[anti-aircraft]] [[autocannons]]. The latter consisted of Yugoslav [[Zastava M55]] 20mm triple-barreled, Soviet [[ZPU|ZPU (ZPU-1, ZPU-2, ZPU-4)]] 14.5mm and [[ZU-23-2]] 23mm AA autocannons (mostly mounted on [[Technical (vehicle)|technicals]] and transport trucks), which were employed in both [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defense]] and direct fire supporting roles.

==Illegal activities and controversy==
Financing for the NLP militia came at first from both Chamoun’s personal fortune and from 'protection' [[racket (crime)|racket]]s collected in the areas under their control,&lt;ref&gt;Randall, ''Going All the Way'' (1984), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; though they also received outside help.  Conservative [[Arab people|Arab countries]] such as [[Jordan]] and the [[United States]], provided covert funding, weapons, ammunition, training and other non-lethal assistance.&lt;ref&gt;El-Kazen, ''The Breakdown of the State in Lebanon'' (2000), p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of it entered towards the illegal port of [[Dbayeh]], set up in early 1976 and administered by Joseph Abboud, former personal [[chauffeur]] and hunting partner of Camille Chamoun, who run drug-smuggling and arms contraband activities on the behalf of the NLP until 1980, when the [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces]] brought the port under their control.

Ruthless fighters with a reputation of aggressiveness, often initiating hostilities with the opposition side,&lt;ref&gt;McGowan, Roberts, Abu Khalil, and Scott Mason, ''Lebanon: a country study'' (1989), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collelo, ''Lebanon: a country study'' (1989), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; aggrivated by lack of discipline and restraint,&lt;ref&gt;Bavly &amp; Salpeter, ''Fire in Beirut'' (1984), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; they were involved in the [[Karantina massacre|Karantina]], [[Al-Masklah]] and [[Siege of Tel al-Zaatar|Tel al-Zaatar Massacre]]s of [[Palestinian refugee]]s in [[East Beirut]] and Dbayeh, allied with the [[Army of Free Lebanon]], [[Al-Tanzim]], [[Kataeb Regulatory Forces]], [[Lebanese Youth Movement (MKG)|Lebanese Youth Movement]] and the [[Guardians of the Cedars]].

Towards the end of the 1970s, however, rivalries within the [[Lebanese Front]] coalition strained the relationship between the NLP Tigers' militia and their erstwhile Christian allies, leading them to violent confrontation with the Phalangists and the Guardians of the Cedars.  The Tigers' even battled these two factions in May 1979 for control of the [[Furn esh Shebbak]] and [[Ain el-Rammaneh]] districts in Beirut, and for the town of [[Akoura]] in the [[Matn District]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Ballance, ''Civil War in Lebanon'' (1998), p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Tigers in the Lebanese civil war==
===Early expansion phase 1975-77===
Upon the outbreak of the civil war in April 1975, the NLP Tigers immediately engaged the leftist [[Lebanese National Movement]] (LNM) militias and their [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] PLO allies, being heavily committed in several battles in and outside the Beirut area. In October 1975, they supported their Phalangist allies of the [[Kataeb Regulatory Forces]] (KRF) militia against the [[Al-Mourabitoun]] and the [[Nasserite Correctionist Movement]] (NCM) for the control of the [[Battle of the Hotels|Hotels district in centre Beirut]].&lt;ref&gt;Jureidini, McLaurin, and Price, ''Military operations in selected Lebanese built-up areas'' (1979), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Ballance, ''Civil War in Lebanon'' (1998), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1976 the collapse of the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] (LAF) enabled the Tigers to take over Army barracks and depots located at Achrafieh, [[Ain el-Rammaneh]], [[Hadath, Baabda|Hadath]], [[Baabda]], and [[Hazmiyeh]] districts of [[East Beirut]], seizing heavy weapons and enrolling defectors into their ranks. The Tigers later joined in March that year the allied Christian [[Lebanese Front]] militias in the defense of the [[Mount Lebanon]] region and the [[Aley District]] against the combined LNM-PLO-[[Lebanese Arab Army]] (LAA) 'Spring Offensive'.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, ''The Gemayels'' (1988), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Hundred Days' War]] in February 1978 the Tigers, backed by the [[Tyous Team of Commandos]] (TTC), put a spirited defence of the Achrafieh and [[Fayadieh]] districts in support of the [[Army of Free Lebanon]] (AFL) against the [[Syrian Army]].

=== Reversals and decline 1978-1980 ===

The Tigers' involvement in the above-mentioned atrocities, however, cost them the loss of Iqlim al-Kharrub to the [[Lebanese National Movement|LNM]]-[[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] [[Political alliance|alliance]] supported by [[Palestine Liberation Army]] units on 20-22 January 1976, which they failed to defend despite being backed by [[Internal Security Forces|ISF]] units and [[Lebanese Army]] troops.&lt;ref&gt;McGowan, Roberts, Abu Khalil, and Scott Mason, ''Lebanon: a country study'' (1989), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hokayem, ''L'armée libanaise pendant la guerre: un instrument du pouvoir du président de la République (1975-1985)'' (2012), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of this important stronghold was a severe blow to the NLP and the Tigers (coupled by the death of their commander [[Naim Berdkan]]), depriving them of their main recruiting area along with their local training infrastructure, chiefly the [[Es-Saadiyat]] camp, and the port towns of [[Damour]] and [[Jiyeh]].

Relations between the NLP political board and the Tigers' military command soured after the former, headed by [[Camille Chamoun]], supported [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon|Syria's military intervention in June that year]] whereas the latter, now led by Camille's son [[Dany Chamoun]], opposed it.  Fearing that his own party's militia was getting out of control, Camille tacitly allowed the NLP's [[Kataeb]] rivals to absorb the Tigers into the [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces]] (LF) under [[Bachir Gemayel]].{{cn|date=March 2018}} Dany's adamant refusal of allowing the Tigers to be incorporated led to a Phalangist assault on his militia's headquarters in [[Safra, Lebanon|Safra]] on July 7, 1980, which resulted in [[Safra massacre|a massacre]] that claimed up to 500 lives, including civilians and 80 of Dany's men.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Russel, and Volstad, ''Armies in Lebanon'' (1985), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, ''The Gemayels'' (1988), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGowan, Roberts, Abu Khalil, and Scott Mason, ''Lebanon: a country study'' (1989), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoy and Ostrovsky, ''By Way of Deception'' (1990), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Ballance, ''Civil War in Lebanon'' (1998), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menargues, ''Les Secrets de la guerre du Liban'' (2004), pp. 53-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

While their leader Dany was rushed to exile,&lt;ref&gt;Menargues, ''Les Secrets de la guerre du Liban'' (2004), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; first to [[Syria]] and then to [[Europe]] after handling over the command of the Tigers to his elder brother [[Dory Chamoun]], the militia was officially disbanded on Camille's orders in late August. Soon afterwards, the Phalangists seized nearly all of the Tigers' positions in and outside [[East Beirut canton|East Beirut]], including the vital Naas and Adma training camps.  The remaining 3,000 militiamen either surrendered their weapons and returned home or found themselves being consolidated by the end of October of that year into the [[Damouri Brigade]] within the [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;Menargues, ''Les Secrets de la guerre du Liban'' (2004), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Revival and disbandment 1983-1990 ===

The [[1982 Lebanon War|Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982]], coupled by the death of the LF supremo [[Bachir Gemayel]] in September that year brought the resurgence of the [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberals]] into the political scene, although the efforts by [[Camille Chamoun]] to revive the Tigers militia in 1983-84 proved less successful. The small force of only 100 or so lightly equipped fighters they gathered proved incapable of competing with the [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces]]' military might, being relegated to the role of a mere [[bodyguard]] for the NLP political leaders for the remainder of the war.

Upon the end of the civilian strife in October 1990 and the subsequent assassination of [[Dany Chamoun]] – who had succeeded his late father at the NLP's presidency in October 1987 – the last remaining [[National Liberal Party (Lebanon)|National Liberals]]' paramilitary organization was disarmed on orders of the new [[Lebanese government]].  The NLP Tigers are no longer active.

==The Free Tigers==
The '''Free Tigers''' ([[Arabic]]: ''Noumour Al-Horr'') or '''Lionceaux Libres''' in [[French language|French]], also known variously as the '''"Hannache Group"''', '''"Hannache's Tigers"''' or '''"Lionceaux d'Hannache"''', were a dissident splinter group of the NLP Tigers formed soon after the forcible merger of the latter into the [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces]] in July 1980. Defying the official orders to disband, about 200 Tigers' militiamen commanded by [[Elias El-Hannouche]] (''nom de guerre'' 'Hannache') went underground to wage a guerrilla war against the LF, operating in the [[Hadath, Baabda|Hadath]] and [[Ain el-Rammaneh]] districts of [[East Beirut]] from August to late October 1980.  The Free Tigers are believed to have been responsible for some bomb and guerrilla attacks in East Beirut, including an ambush with combined rocket- and small-arms' fire on the U.S. Embassador's motorcade in August that year (intended to discredit the LF), followed on 10 November by two [[car-bomb]] explosions on the [[Achrafieh]] quarter that left 10 dead and 62 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Menargues, ''Les Secrets de la guerre du Liban'' (2004), pp. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;
Defeated after a four-day street battle despite being backed by [[Lebanese Army]] troops sent upon request of the NLP president [[Camille Chamoun]]&lt;ref&gt;Kechichian, ''The Lebanese Army: Capabilities and Challenges in the 1980s'' (1985), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Ballance, ''Civil War in Lebanon'' (1998), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; and forced out in mid-November of their last remaining strongholds at Ain el-Rammaneh by the LF, Hannache and a number of its dissident Tigers fled across the [[Green Line (Lebanon)|Green Line]] into the Muslim-controlled western sector of the Lebanese Capital.&lt;ref&gt;Menargues, ''Les Secrets de la guerre du Liban'' (2004), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; There they placed themselves under the protection of the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Fatah]] intelligence service before moving to the Syrian-controlled [[Beqaa Valley]].  On 14 December 1980, Hannache and 50 Free Tigers' militiamen stormed and seized the Hoch el-Oumara suburb of [[Zahlé]], before being driven out by local LF units the following day; the Free Tigers returned to Zahlé on December 20 and managed to seize by force the former NLP party offices' but they were resisted by the LF and subsequently forced to withdraw from the town on December 22 under [[Syrian Army]] protection.&lt;ref&gt;Mclaurin, ''The battle of Zahle'' (1986), pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menargues, ''Les Secrets de la guerre du Liban'' (2004), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The Free Tigers seemed to have remained operational until 1981, though very little was heard from them afterwards.

==Legacy==
Since 2002, several former NLP Tigers' commanders known for their right-wing, ultra-nationalist leanings rallied in support of General [[Michel Aoun]] and went on to occupy various key positions within the Aounist [[Free Patriotic Movement]] (FPM) hierarchy, ranging from political (Dr [[Naji Hayek]] and [[Georges Aaraj]]) to security ([[Jean Eid]] and Bob Azzam).

The '''United Communist Party of Armenia''' ({{lang-hy|Հայաստանի Միավորված Կոմունիստական Կուսակցության}}, abbreviated ՀՄԿԿ / HMKK, ''Hayastani Miatsial Komunistakan Kusaktsutyun'') is a communist [[political party]] in [[Armenia]]. It was formed on July 7, 2003 through the merger of:

*'''[[Renewed Communist Party of Armenia]]''' - (in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Հայաստանի նորացված կոմունիստական կուսակցություն ''Hayastani Noratsvats Komunistakan Kusaktsutyun'') abbreviated HNKK, formed on May 25, 2002, by former [[Armenian Communist Party]] (HKK) leaders Yuri Manukian and Grant Voskanyan who had been expelled from HKK the previous year on the grounds that they had advocated cooperation with the government. Manukian became the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the United Communist Party of Armenia
*'''[[Armenian Workers Communist Party]]''' - (in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Հայաստանի աշխատավորության կոմունիստական կուսակցություն ''Hayastani Ashkhatavorutian Komunistakan Kusaktsutiun'')
*'''[[Armenian Workers Union]]''' -  (in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Հայ աշխատավորների միություն)  founded in 1999.
*'''[[Union of Communists of Armenia]]''' - (in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]: Հայաստանի կոմունիստների միություն). In the 2003 [[elections in Armenia|elections]], the party formed part of the [[Free and Fair Armenia]] electoral bloc before joining the United Communist Party of Armenia.
*'''[[Marxist Party of Armenia]]''' - (in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]:Հայաստանի մարքսիստական կուսակցություն) The Marxist Party of Armenia had registered in 1997, but failed to get re-registered by 1 January 2001. In the 2003 [[elections in Armenia|elections]], the party formed part of the [[Free and Fair Armenia]] electoral bloc before joining the United Communist Party of Armenia. 
*Party of Intellectuals.

The HMKK held its first congress on March 25, 2004. [[Yuri Manoukian]] was elected First Secretary of the party. The meeting saw the election of a 77-member [[Central Committee]] and a 17-member [[Politburo]].

The HMKK considers itself as a "constructive opposition party". It has closer links to the government than the main [[Armenian Communist Party]] and does not join opposition fronts.

The HMKK extended its support to the successful presidential bid of Defense Minister [[Serzh Sargsyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1341722.html|title=Caucasus Report: May 30, 2005|date=2005-05-30|website=Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306031309/http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1341722.html|archive-date=2016-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Costa Rica}}
The 1949 [[Constitution of Costa Rica]] established two '''Vice-Presidencies of Costa Rica''', which are directly elected through a popular vote on a ticket with the [[President of Costa Rica|president]] for a period of four years, with no immediate re-election. There has been various incarnations of the office. Vice presidents replace the president in cases of temporary or permanent absence.

Throughout the history of independent [[Costa Rica]], there have been different systems to cover the temporary or permanent absence of a president. Several different names have been used for this position:
*From 1821 to 1824, the Governing Committee (Junta) selected a vice-president.
*From 1824 to 1841 there was a Vice-Head-of-State who was popularly elected.
*From 1841 to 1842 there was a Second-Head-of-State, elected for life by popular vote.
*From 1842 to 1844 there was a Vice-Head-of-State selected by the Constitutional Assembly.
*From 1846 to 1847 there was a popularly elected Vice-Head-of-State.
*From 1847 to 1848 there was a Vice-President of the State, elected by popular vote.
*From 1848 to 1859 there was a Vice-President of the Republic, selected through popular election.
*From 1859 to 1949 there was a system of Designates to the Presidency, usually selected by the Legislature.
*Since 1949 there have been two popularly elected vice presidents.

The following tables contain a list of the officials elected to the vice-presidential position since 1821.

A '''village hall''' is usually a building and gathering place in a [[village]]. It may also serve multiple other functions.

==United Kingdom==
[[Image:BSH SW P1010018.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bedhampton]] Social Hall, United Kingdom]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], a '''village hall''' is usually a building within a village which contains at least one large room, usually owned by and run for the benefit of the local community. Such a hall is typically used for a variety of public and private functions, such as:
*[[Parish councils in England|Parish council]] meetings
*[[Polling station]] for local and national elections
*Sports club functions
*[[community theater|Local drama productions]]
*Dances
*[[Jumble sale]]s
*Private parties such as birthdays or wedding receptions

Village halls sometimes have [[Charitable organization|charitable]] status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Library/guidance/cc18text.pdf Use of Church Halls for Village Hall and Other Charitable Purposes], ''[[Charity Commission]]'', [[United Kingdom]], July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; They may have other names such as a Village Institute or Memorial Hall. In some localities a [[church hall]] or [[community centre]] provides similar functions.

The word ''neuadd'' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: /'neiæð/) is used to refer to village halls in Welsh-speaking parts of [[Wales]], as in {{lang|cy|Neuadd Dyfi}}, the village hall in [[Aberdyfi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Zionist-Socialist Workers Party''' ({{lang-ru|Сионистско-социалистическая рабочая партия}}), often referred to simply as '''Zionist-Socialists''' or '''S.S.''' by their [[Russian language|Russian]] initials, was a [[Jew]]ish [[socialist]] [[Jewish Territorialist Organization|territorialist]] [[political party]] in the [[Russian Empire]] and [[Poland]], that emerged from the ''Vozrozhdenie'' (Renaissance) group in 1904. The party held its founding conference in [[Odessa]] in 1905.&lt;ref name="alroey"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Alroey |first=Gur |title=Demographers in the service of the nation: Liebmann Hersch, Jacob Lestschinsky, and the early study of Jewish migration |journal=Jewish History |year=2006 |volume=20 |pages=265–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= V.

In the same year the party sent delegates, among them [[Nachman Syrkin]], to the Basle Seventh Zionist Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Frankel|first=Jonathan|title=Prophecy and politics: socialism, nationalism, and the Russian Jews, 1862–1917|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1984|pages=686|isbn=978-0-521-26919-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-ycwctuCSpQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while the mainstream Zionist movement rejected the idea of a Jewish state anywhere but in [[Eretz Yisrael]], the Russian party favoured the idea of a Jewish territorial autonomy, outside of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="harn"&gt;Ėstraĭkh, G. ''In Harness: Yiddish Writers' Romance with Communism. Judaic traditions in literature, music, and art.'' [[Syracuse, New York]]: Syracuse University Press, 2005. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, while territorial autonomy was the goal of the party, it dedicated most of its energy into revolutionary activities in Russia.&lt;ref name="crisis"/&gt; Like other Russian revolutionary groups such as the [[Narodniks]], the party was positive towards using [[terrorism]] as a means of struggle against the establishment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anna Geifman|Geifman, Anna]]. ''Thou Shalt Kill: Revolutionary Terrorism in Russia, 1894&amp;ndash;1917''. [[Princeton, New Jersey]]: Princeton University Press, 1993. p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nachman Syrkin]], [[Jacob Lestschinsky]], [[Volf Latsky-Bartoldi]] and [[Shmuel Niger]] were among the leading figures of the party.&lt;ref name="crisis"&gt;Frankel, Jonathan (ed.). ''The Jews and the European crisis, 1914&amp;ndash;1921''. [[New York City|New York]]: Oxford University Press, 1988. p. 339&lt;/ref&gt;

The party played an active role in the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|1905 revolution]].&lt;ref name="crisis"/&gt;

At the 7th congress of the [[World Zionist Organization]] in 1905, the WZO formally rejected the '[[British Uganda Programme|Uganda Plan]]' (a proposal to resettle Jews in [[East Africa]]) after sharp debates. In response, the party and other territorialists withdrew from the WZO.&lt;ref name="alroey"/&gt;

The party grew rapidly, and became the second largest Jewish labour party after the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]].&lt;ref name="alroey"/&gt; The party organized 'neutral' [[trade union]]s, in opposition to the Bundist unions. In the end of 1906, the party claimed a membership of 27 000. However, after 1906 the influence of the party began to decline sharply. Many leaders went into exile in Western Europe.&lt;ref name="crisis"/&gt; The central organ of the party was the weekly [[Yiddish]] newspaper ''Der nayer veg'', published from [[Vilna]] 1906&amp;ndash;1907. The newspaper was closed down by the authorities in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Newspapers and Periodicals |publisher=YIVO Institute |url=http://www.yivoinstitute.org/pdf/newspapers_periodicals.pdf |accessdate=2014-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1907 [[Stuttgart]] congress of the [[Second International]], the [[International Socialist Bureau]] decided to give a consultative vote to the party at the congress. The decision was, however, overturned a year later.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, Jonathan. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ycwctuCSpQC Prophecy and Politics: Socialism, Nationalism, and the Russian Jews, 1862–1917]''.

Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2001. p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911 party, the [[Jewish Socialist Workers Party]] and [[Poalei Zion]] signed a joint appeal to the [[International Socialist Bureau]], asking the International to recognize the national character of the Jewish people.&lt;ref name="j8"/&gt;

In 1917 the party merged with the Jewish Socialist Workers Party, forming the [[United Jewish Socialist Workers Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaff Schatz. Jews and the communist movement in interwar Poland.
