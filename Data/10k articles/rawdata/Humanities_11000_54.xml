[[Image:ALWDcvr.jpg|thumb|''ALWD Citation Manual'']]

'''''ALWD Guide to Legal Citation''''', formerly '''''ALWD Citation Manual''''', is a [[style guide]] providing a [[legal citation]] system for the [[United States]], compiled by the [[Association of Legal Writing Directors]]. Its first edition was published in 2000, under editor [[Darby Dickerson]]. Its sixth edition, under editor [[Coleen M. Barger]], was released in May 2017.

It primarily competes with the ''[[Bluebook]]'' style, a system developed by the law reviews at [[Harvard Law School|Harvard]], [[Yale Law School|Yale]], [[University of Pennsylvania Law School|University of Pennsylvania]], and [[Columbia Law School|Columbia]]. Citations in the two formats are roughly similar. However, ''ALWD'' differs from ''Bluebook'' in one key respect: Under the ''Bluebook'' system, the type styles used in citations found in academic legal articles (always footnoted) are very different from those used in citations within court documents (always cited inline). While the ''ALWD'' system follows the standard convention of footnotes within academic articles and inline citations in court documents, it rejects ''Bluebook''{{'}}s insistence on using different type styles in the two classes of documents. The ''ALWD'' type style is identical to that used in the ''Bluebook'' system for citations within court documents.

==Adoption==

Four U.S. jurisdictions have adopted ''ALWD'':
* [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]]
**This court accepts citations in either ''ALWD'' or ''Bluebook'' format, but also requires that citations to [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] decisions provide both official "U.S." and [[West (publisher)|West]]'s "S.Ct." citations, when available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rules/Addena |url=http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/rules/index.php |accessdate=6 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601113415/http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/rules/index.php |archivedate=1 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[United States District Court for the District of Montana]]
**This court specifically accepts either ''ALWD'' or ''Bluebook''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Local Rules of Procedure: United States District Court for the District of Montana |url=http://www.mtd.uscourts.gov/mtd/documents.nsf/3a55ca523f1ad3ef882563fb0080c38f/3fa0ae63fdb1bd99872570c9006b1f14/$FILE/LOCAL%20RULES%202005.pdf |accessdate=April 8, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924021814/http://www.mtd.uscourts.gov/mtd/Documents.nsf/3a55ca523f1ad3ef882563fb0080c38f/3fa0ae63fdb1bd99872570c9006b1f14/%24FILE/LOCAL%20RULES%202005.pdf |archivedate=September 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[United States Bankruptcy Court]], Montana
**This court accepts any "nationally recognized citation form", and specifically names the ''ALWD Citation Manual''. It does not mention ''Bluebook'' by name, but given its national recognition (it is the dominant legal style guide in the United States), it should be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LOCAL BANKRUPTCY RULES FOR THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MONTANA |url=http://www.mtd.uscourts.gov/mtd/documents.nsf/3a55ca523f1ad3ef882563fb0080c38f/460c7c7d0ea0e6a587256ee800679ef9/$FILE/2001%20Mont.%20Local%20Bankr%20Rules.pdf |accessdate=April 8, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060924021750/http://www.mtd.uscourts.gov/mtd/Documents.nsf/3a55ca523f1ad3ef882563fb0080c38f/460c7c7d0ea0e6a587256ee800679ef9/%24FILE/2001%20Mont.%20Local%20Bankr%20Rules.pdf |archivedate=September 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Command Judge Advocate Office]] at the U.S. Army base on [[Kwajalein Atoll]] (leased from the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]]).

In addition to those, 72 law schools and 47 paralegal schools have fully adopted ''ALWD''. Law journals such as ''Animal Law'', ''NAELA'', and ''Legal Writing'' have also adopted ''ALWD''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALWD Citation Manual adoptions|publisher=ALWD|url=http://www.alwd.org/publications/adoptions/|accessdate=2016-04-22}} Law school adoption numbers reported as of December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27030">{{Cyborg}}
"'''A Cyborg Manifesto'''" is an essay written by [[Donna Haraway]] and published in 1985. In it, the concept of the cyborg is a rejection of rigid boundaries, notably those separating "human" from "animal" and "human" from "machine." She writes: "The cyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic family, this time without the oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning to dust."&lt;ref name="fulltext" /&gt;

The ''Manifesto'' criticizes traditional notions of feminism, particularly feminist focuses on [[identity politics]], and encouraging instead coalition through affinity. She uses the metaphor of a cyborg to urge feminists to move beyond the limitations of traditional gender, feminism, and politics; consequently, the "Manifesto" is considered one of the milestones in the development of feminist [[posthumanist]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ferrando|first=Francesca|title=Posthumanism|journal=Kilden Journal of Gender Research|date=2014|volume=2|pages=168–172|url=https://www.academia.edu/8041656/POSTHUMANISM|accessdate=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major points==
[[File:Donna Haraway and Cayenne.jpg|thumb|Haraway, the author, in 2006]]
Haraway begins the ''Manifesto'' by explaining three boundary breakdowns since the 20th Century that have allowed for her hybrid, cyborg myth: the breakdown of boundaries between human and animal, animal-human and machine, and physical and non-physical. Evolution has blurred the lines between human and animal; 20th Century machines have made ambiguous the lines between natural and artificial; and microelectronics and the political invisibility of cyborgs have confused the lines of physicality.&lt;ref name="fulltext"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120214194015/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Haraway/CyborgManifesto.html Full text of the article "Cyborg Manifesto"] (an archived copy, in the [[Wayback Machine]]).  It is the full text of the article: {{cite book|last=Haraway|first=Donna Jeanne|authorlink=Donna Haraway|title=Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature|year=1991|publisher=Routledge|chapter=A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century|isbn=0415903866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issues with Western patriarchal tenets===
Haraway highlights the problematic use and justification of Western traditions like [[patriarchy]], [[colonialism]], [[essentialism]], and [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]] (among others). These traditions in turn allow for the problematic formations of taxonomies (and identifications of the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]) and what Haraway explains as "antagonistic dualisms" that order Western discourse. These dualisms, Haraway states, "have all been systematic to the logics and practices of domination of women, people of color, nature, workers, animals... all [those] constituted as others." She highlights specific problematic dualisms of self/other, culture/nature, male/female, civilized/primitive, right/wrong, truth/illusion, total/partial, God/man (among others). She explains that these dualisms are in competition with one another, creating paradoxical relations of domination (especially between the One and the Other). However, high-tech culture provides a challenge to these antagonistic dualisms.

===Cyborg theory===
Haraway's cyborg theory rejects the notions of essentialism, proposing instead a chimeric, monstrous world of fusions between animal and machine. Cyborg theory relies on writing as "the technology of cyborgs," and asserts that "cyborg politics is the struggle for language and the struggle against perfect communication, against the one code that translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism." Instead, Haraway’s cyborg calls for a non-essentialized, material-semiotic metaphor capable of uniting diffuse political coalitions along the lines of affinity rather than identity. Following Lacanian feminists such as Luce Irigaray, Haraway’s work addresses the chasm between feminist discourses and the dominant language of Western patriarchy. As Haraway explains, “grammar is politics by other means,” and effective politics require speaking in the language of domination.&lt;ref name="fulltext"/&gt;

As she details in a chart of the paradigmatic shifts from modern to postmodern epistemology within the Manifesto, the unified human subject of identity has shifted to the hybridized posthuman of technoscience, from “representation” to “simulation,” “bourgeois novel” to “science fiction,” “reproduction” to “replication,” and “white capitalist patriarchy” to “informatics of domination.”&lt;ref name="fulltext"/&gt; While Haraway’s “ironic dream of a common language” is inspired by Irigaray’s argument for a discourse other than patriarchy, she rejects Irigaray’s essentializing construction of woman-as-not-male to argue for a linguistic community of situated, partial knowledges in which no one is innocent.

===Criticism of traditional feminism===
Haraway takes issue with some traditional feminists, reflected in statements describing how "women more than men somehow sustain daily life, and so have a privileged epistemological (relating to the theory of knowledge) position potentially." The views of traditional feminism operate under the totalizing assumptions that all men are one way, and women another, whereas "a cyborg theory of wholes and parts," does not desire to explain things in total theory. Haraway suggests that feminists should move beyond naturalism and essentialism, criticizing feminist tactics as "identity politics" that victimize those excluded, and she proposes that it is better strategically to confuse identities. 
Her criticism mainly focuses on socialist and radical feminism. The former, she writes, achieves "to expand the category of labour to what (some) women did" Socialist feminism does not naturalize but rather builds a unity that was non-existent before -namely the woman worker.
On the other hand, radical feminism, according to Catherine MacKinnon, describes a world in which the woman only exists in opposition to the man. The concept of woman is socially constructed within the patriarchal structure of society and woman only exist because men have made them exist. The woman as a self does not exist. 
Haraway criticizes both when writing that "my complaint about socialist/Marxian standpoints is their unintended erasure of polyvocal, unassimilable, radical difference made visible in anti-colonial discourse and practice" and "MacKinnon's intentional erasure of all difference through the device of the 'essential' non-existence of women is not reassuring" (299).  H&lt;ref name="fulltext"/&gt;

Haraway also indirectly critiques [[white feminism]] by highlighting the struggles of women of color: she suggests that a woman of color “might be understood as a cyborg identity, a potent subjectivity synthesized from fusions of outsider identities and in the complex political-historical layerings of her ‘biomythography.’"&lt;ref name="fulltext"/&gt;

To counteract the essentializing and anachronistic rhetoric of spiritual ecofeminists, who were fighting patriarchy with modernist constructions of female-as-nature and earth mothers, Haraway employs the cyborg to refigure feminism into cybernetic code.

===Call to action===
Haraway calls for a revision of the concept of gender, moving away from Western patriarchal essentialism and toward "the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous world without gender," stating that "Cyborgs might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex and sexual embodiment. Gender might not be global identity after all, even if it has profound historical breadth and depth."&lt;ref name="fulltext"/&gt;

Haraway also calls for a reconstruction of identity, no longer dictated by naturalism and [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] but instead by affinity, wherein individuals can construct their own groups by choice. In this way, groups may construct a "post-modernist identity out of otherness, difference, and specificity" as a way to counter Western traditions of exclusive identification.

== Updates and revisions ==
Although Haraway's metaphor of the cyborg has been labelled as a post-gender statement, Haraway has clarified her stance on [[post-genderism]] in some interviews.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Haraway Reader|last=Haraway|first=Donna|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=0-415-96688-4|location=|pages=321–341|chapter='Cyborgs, Coyotes, and Dogs: A Kinship of Feminist Figurations' and 'There are Always More Things Going on Than You Thought! Methodologies as Thinking Technologies'|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She acknowledges that her argument in the ''Manifesto ''seeks to challenge the necessity for categorization of gender, but does not correlate this argument to post-genderism. She clarifies this distinction because post-genderism is often associated with the discourse of the utopian concept of being beyond masculinity and femininity. Haraway notes that gender constructs are still prevalent and meaningful, but are troublesome and should therefore be eliminated as categories for identity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Applications of ''The Cyborg''==
Although Donna Haraway intended her concept of the cyborg to be a feminist critique, she acknowledges that other scholars and popular media have taken her concept and applied it to different contexts. Haraway is aware and receptive of the different uses of her concept of the cyborg, but admits "very few people are taking what I consider all of its parts".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Magazine]]'' overlooked the feminist theory of the cyborg and instead used it to make a more literal commentary about the enmeshment of humans and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kunzru|first=Hari|title=You Are Cyborg|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/5.02/ffharaway_pr.html|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Haraway also recognizes  that new feminist scholars "embrace and use the cyborg of the manifesto to do what they want for their own purposes".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== "Patchwork Girl" ===
[[File:Shelley Jackson.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shelley Jackson]], author of ''Patchwork Girl.'']]

[[Patchwork Girl (hypertext)|Patchwork Girl]], a hypertext work, makes use of elements from ''Cyborg Manifesto''. ''Patchwork Girl's'' "thematic focus on the connections between monstrosity, subjectivity, and new reproductive technologies is apparent from its very first page, when readers, or users, open the hypertext to find a picture of a scarred and naked female body sewn together with a single dotted line...Readers enter the text by clicking on this body and following its 'limbs' or links to different sections of the text."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In Jackson's narrative, the Patchwork Girl is an aborted female monster created by [[Victor Frankenstein]] of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus]], ''is an abhorrent and monstrous creature that is "part male, part female, part animal, 175 years old, and 'razed' up through hypertext technology."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The monster, following her destruction by Victor, is sewn back together by [[Mary Shelley]] herself, while simultaneously becoming Mary's lover; she is thus, "a cyborg who is queer, dis-proportioned, and visibly scarred. She both facilitates and undermines preoccupations with the benefits and dangers of reproductive technologies by embracing all of the monstrosities that reproductive/fetal screenings are imagined to 'catch' and one day prevent."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Patchwork Girl embraces Haraway's conception of a cybernetic posthuman being in both her physical multiplicity and her challenge towards "the images and fantasies sustaining reproductive politics."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== "Cyborg Goddesses" ===
Turkish critical scholar Leman Giresunlu uses Haraway's cyborg as framework to examine current science fiction movies such as ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]] ''and [[Resident Evil]] in her essay "Cyborg Goddesses: The Mainframe Revisited".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giresunlu|first=Leman|title=Cyborg Goddesses: The Mainframe Revisited|journal=At the Interface / Probing the Boundaries|year=2009|pages=157–187}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this essay, she explores how her new concept of the ''cyborg goddess, ''a female figure "capable of inflicting pain and pleasure simultaneously",'' '' can be used to make sense of how female representation is shifting towards a more multidimensional stance. Giresunlu builds from Haraway's cyborg because the ''cyborg goddess'' goes beyond "offering a way out from [the] duality" and instead provides how spirituality and technology work together to form a complex and more accurate representation of women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== "Mind Over Matter" ===
In her essay "Mind Over Matter: Mental Evolution and Physical Devolution in The Incredible Shrinking Man", American critical scholar Ruthellen Cunnally uses Haraway's cyborg to help make sense of how Robert Scott Carey, the protagonist of ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Man]]'', transforms into a cyborg in the midst of a metaphor of cold war politics in his home. As Robert continues to shrink, the gendered power dynamic between him and his wife Louise shifts from "the realm of husband/wife into the mode of mother/son".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cunnally|first=Ruthellen|title=Mind Over Matter: Mental Evolution and Physical Devolution in The Incredible Shrinking Man|journal=Journal of Popular Film and Television|date=March 2013|doi=10.1080/01956051.2012.674070|volume=41|pages=2–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Robert finds himself lost in the feminine space of the basement, an area of the house that was reserved for Louise's domestic duties of sewing and washing, he is forced to fight for his life and reclaim his masculinity. Although he is able to conquer some of his foes and regain his "manhood", the gender lines do not become established again because there is no one to share and implement the gendered power structure with. Robert's transformation presents "an existence in which acceptance and meaning are released from the limitations of patriarchal dualisms", which aligns with Haraway's cyborg.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Traditional feminists have criticized "A Cyborg Manifesto" as anti-feminist because it denies any commonalities of the female experience.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In the ''Manifesto,'' Haraway writes "there is nothing about being 'female' that naturally binds women",&lt;ref name="fulltext" /&gt; which goes against a defining characteristic of traditional feminism that calls women to join together in order to advocate for members of their gender.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Criticism and controversy were built into the essay's publication history: the East Coast Collective of the ''[[Socialist Review]]'' found the piece "a naive embrace of technology" and advocated against its publication, while The Berkeley Collective ultimately insisted that it go to print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kafer|first1=Alison|title=Feminist, Queer, Crip|date=2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Indiana|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay has been described as "controversial" and "viral" in its circulation through multiple academic departments and disciplinary boundaries, contributing to the critical discourse on its claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schneider|first1=Joseph|title=Haraway's Viral Cyborg|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|date=Summer 2012|volume=40|issue=1/2|page=295|jstor=23333459}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This controversiality was matched by its omnipresence; Jackie Orr, Associate Professor of Sociology at the [[Maxwell School of Syracuse University]], writes, "It is hard to be a feminist graduate student in the U.S. humanities or social sciences after 1985 and not be touched in some way by the cyborg manifesto."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orr|first1=Jackie|title=Materializing a Cyborg's Manifesto|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|date=Summer 2012|volume=40|issue=1/2|page=276|jstor=23333457}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid adoption of the article in academic circles also increased the pace of the critical conversation surrounding the work, and in 1990, Haraway felt that the essay had "acquired a surprise half life," which made it "impossible to rewrite" and necessitated revisiting the topic in her subsequent publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gandy|first1=Matthew|title=The Persistence of Complexity: Re-reading Donna Haraway's ''Cyborg Manifesto''|journal=AA Files|date=2010|volume=60|page=42|jstor=41378495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many critiques of "A Cyborg Manifesto" focus on a basic level of reader comprehension and writing style, such as Orr's observation that "undergraduate students in a science and technology class find the cyborg manifesto curiously relevant but somewhat impenetrable to read." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orr|first1=Jackie|title=Materializing a Cyborg's Manifesto|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|date=Summer 2012|volume=40|issue=1/2|page=275|jstor=23333457}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamner, M.

Oxford University Press. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This is corroborated by Helen Merrick and Margret Grebowicz's observation that scientists who reviewed ''Primate Visions'' had similar issues, particularly as related to Haraway's use of irony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grebowicz|first1=Margret|last2=Merrick|first2=Helen|title=Beyond the Cyborg: Adventures with Donna Haraway.|date=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York: NY|page=158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hWm0w4x1fDEC&amp;dq|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Judy Wajcman]], Professor of Sociology at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], suggests in ''TechnoFeminism'' that "the openness of her writing to a variety of readings is intentional," which "can sometimes make Haraway difficult to interpret;" however, it does not seem that Wajcman critiques Haraway's tone for its capability to encompass more possibilities, rather than limit them. Wajcman concludes her chapter "Send in the Cyborgs" on a critical note, claiming that "Certainly, Haraway is much stronger at providing evocative figurations of a new feminist subjectivity than she is at providing guidelines for a practical emancipatory politics." &lt;ref name="TechnoFeminism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wajcman|first1=Judy|title=TechnoFeminism|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/TechnoFeminism.html?id=I63wvqQyHQcC|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cyborgs, Coyotes, and Dogs: A Kinship of Feminist Figurations and There are Always More Things Going on Than You Thought! Methodologies as Thinking Technologies|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-96688-4|pages=321–341}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Haraway have also centered on the accessibility of the thematic topics she discusses in her writing, and according to third-wave feminist readings, her work "assumes a reader who is familiar with North American culture," and posits that "readers without the appropriate cultural capital are...likely to find it infuriatingly obscure and impenetrable."&lt;ref name="TechnoFeminism"/&gt; Therefore, Haraway's symbolism is representative of North American culture symbolizing a "non-universalizing vision for feminist strategies" and "has been taken up within cyberfeminism as the symbol of an essential female being." &lt;ref name="TechnoFeminism"/&gt; Considering the question of accessibility more broadly, disability studies have focused on Haraway's essay, noting the absence of "any kind of critical engagement with disability...disabled bodies are simply presented as exemplary...requiring neither analysis nor critique"—a gap which Alison Kafer, Professor of Feminist Studies at Southwestern University, attempts to address in ''Feminist, Queer, Crip''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kafer|first1=Alison|title=Feminist, Queer, Crip|date=2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Indiana|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wajcman also argues that Haraway's view of technology in "A Cyborg Manifesto" is perhaps too totalizing, and that the binary of "the cyborg solution and the goddess solution" ultimately "caricatures feminism" by focusing too readily on a dichotomy that may in fact be a false one.&lt;ref name="TechnoFeminism"/&gt;

In ''Unfinished Work-From Cyborg to Cognisphere'',  N. Katherine Hayles questions the validity of cyborg as a unit of analysis. She says that because of the complicated situation of technology and media, “cyborg is no longer the individual person – or for that matter, the individual cyborg – is no longer the appropriate unit of analysis, if indeed it ever was.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayles|first=Katherine|date=|title=Unfinished Work: From Cyborg to Cognisphere|url=|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|volume=23.7-8|pages=159–66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the relationships between cyborg and religion, Robert A. Campbell argues that “in spite of Haraway's efforts to move beyond traditional Western dualisms and offer a new hope for women, and by extension a of humanity and the world, what she in fact offers is a further legitimation for buying into the not so new American civil religion of high technology.” He says that “in spite of what some may view as a radical critique of the present and a potentially frightening prescription for the future, the stark reality about Haraway's 'postmodern reality' is that there is no such thing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Robert A.|date=2001|title=CYBORG SALVATION HISTORY: Donna Haraway and the Future of Religion|url=|journal=Humboldt Journal of Social Relations|volume=26| issue =  1/2|pages=154–173|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond its presence in academic context, "A Cyborg Manifesto" has also had popular traction including [[Wired Magazine]]'s piece by [[Hari Kunzru]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kunzru|first1=Hari|title=You Are Cyborg|url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/5.02/ffharaway_pr.html|website=Wired|publisher=Wired|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mute Magazine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fernandez|first1=Maria|last2=Malik|first2=Suhail|title=Whatever Happened to Cyborg Manifesto?|url=http://www.metamute.org/editorial/articles/whatever-happened-to-cyborg-manifesto|website=Mute|publisher=Mute|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BuzzFeed]],

=== Sonographic fetus as cyborg ===
Scholar Marilyn Maness Mehaffy writes that the "sonographic fetus is in many ways the ultimate cyborg in that it is 'created' in a space of virtuality that straddles the conventional boundary between an organic body and a digital text."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mehaffy | first1 = Marilyn Maness | year = 2000 | title = Fetal attractions: the limit of cyborg theory | url = | journal = Women's Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 177–194 | doi=10.1080/00497878.2000.9979307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it is this cyborg that presents a limit to Haraway's posthuman theory. The sonographic fetus, as posited by scholar Heather Latimer, "is publicly envisioned as both independent of [its mother's] body and as independent of the sonographic equipment used to read this body. We know that fetal images are depictions, yet the sonogram invokes a documentary-like access to fetuses that makes it easy to ignore this, which in turn can limit the authority and agency of pregnant women."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Latimer, Heather. "Reproductive Technologies, Fetal Icons, and Genetic Freaks: Shelley Jackson’s Patchwork Girl and the Limits and Possibilities of Donna Haraway’s Cyborg." Modern Fiction Studies 57.2 (2011): 318-335.&lt;/ref&gt; In positioning the fetus as independent, and consequently oppositional, to the pregnant mother, these reproductive technologies "reinscribe stable meanings to the human/machine dualism they supposedly disrupt."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Valerie Hartouni argues, "most reproductive technologies have assimilated into the 'order of nature'"&lt;ref&gt;Hartouni, Valerie. Cultural Conceptions: On Reproductive Technologies and the Remaking of Life. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; which would make Haraway's vision of a regenerative species, unrestricted by heteronormative conceptions of reproduction, unattainable in the sonographic fetus.

== Publication history ==
Haraway began writing the ''Manifesto ''in 1983 to address the ''[[Socialist Review (US)|Socialist Review]] ''request of American socialist feminists to ponder over the future of [[socialist feminism]] in the context of the early [[Reagan Era|Reagan era]] and the decline of leftist politics. The first versions of the essay had a strong socialist and European connection that the ''Socialist Review ''East Coast Collective found too controversial to publish. The Berkeley ''Socialist Review'' Collective published the essay in 1985 under the editor Jeff Escoffier.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The essay was most widely read as part of Haraway's 1991 book ''Simians, Cyborgs and Women''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Simians, cyborgs, and women: the reinvention of nature.|last=Haraway|first=Donna Jeanne|publisher=Routledge|year=1991|isbn=978-0415903875 |location=New York|pages=149–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5695">An '''adverbial clause''' is a [[Dependent clause|dependent]] [[clause]] that functions as an [[adverb]]; that is, the entire clause modifies a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. As with all clauses, it contains a [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], although the subject as well as the (predicate) verb may sometimes be omitted and implied (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/grammar-lesson-reducing-adverb-clauses-to-modifying-adverbial-phrases/|title=Grammar Lesson - Reducing Adverb Clauses - ELC|date=2014-03-17|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An adverbial clause is commonly, but not always, fronted by a [[Conjunction (grammar)#Subordinating conjunctions|subordinate conjunction]]{{mdash}}sometimes called a trigger word. (In the examples below the adverbial clause is italicized and the subordinate conjunction is bolded.)
* Mary, the aspiring actress, became upset '''''as soon as''' she saw the casting list''.
*:(subject: ''she''; predicate: ''saw the casting list''; the clause modifies the verb ''became'')
* Peter Paul, the drama teacher, met with Mary '''''after''' she came to the next class''.&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*:(explicit subject: ''she''; predicate: ''came to the next class.''; predicate (verb): ''came''; the clause modifies the verb ''met'';)
* He talked carefully '''''in order to''' appear fair.''
* He talked carefully '''''in order .. [that 'he'] ''' appear fair.''
*:(implied subject, ''he'', is omitted; predicate (verb): ''appear''; the clause modifies the adverb ''carefully'')
* The little boy preferred fierce dinosaurs, '''''as''' [was] T rex''.
*:(subject of the clause: ''T rex''; predicate of the clause:  ''[was]'', implied; the clause modifies the adjective ''fierce''.)
According to Sidney Greenbaum and Randolph Quirk, adverbial clauses function mainly as [[adjunct (grammar)|adjuncts]] or [[disjunct (linguistics)|disjuncts]], which parts also perform in a sentence as [[adverbial phrase]]s or as  adverbial [[Adpositional  phrase|prepositional phrases]] (''Greenbaum'' and ''Quirk'',1990). Unlike clauses, phrases do not contain a subject and predicate; they are contrasted here:
* We left the convention ''the day before.''
*:(adverbial phrase; contains no subject or predicate)
* We left ''before the speeches.''
*:(adverbial prepositional phrase; contains no subject or predicate{{mdash}}and no verb (action) is implied)
* We left '''''after''' the speeches ended.''
*:(adverbial clause; contains subject and predicate)
* We left '''''after''' the speeches.''
*:or, (''".. after the speeches [ended]"'')
*:(adverbial clause; contains subject and predicate, but the verb 'ended' is omitted and implied)

==Types==

'''Aesthetic relativism''' is the idea that [[points of view (philosophy)|views]] of [[beauty]] are [[relativism|relative]] to differences in perception and consideration, and [[intrinsic|intrinsically]], have no absolute [[truth]] or [[Validity (logic)|validity]] 

==Overview==
Aesthetic relativism might be regarded as a sub-set of an overall philosophical [[relativism]], which denies any absolute standards of [[truth]] or [[morality]] as well as of aesthetic judgement. (A frequently-cited source for philosophical relativism in [[postmodern]] theory is a fragment by [[Nietzsche]], entitled "On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense.")

For example, in historical terms, the female form as depicted in the [[Venus of Willendorf]] and the women in the paintings of [[Rubens]] would today be regarded as over-weight, while the slim models on the covers of contemporary fashion magazines would no doubt be regarded in a negative light by our predecessors. In contemporary (cross-cultural) terms, [[body modification]] among "[[primitive culture|primitive]]" peoples is sometimes regarded as [[grotesque]] by Western society. 

Aesthetic relativism is a variety of the philosophy known generally as relativism, which casts doubt on the possibility of direct epistemic access to the "external world", and which therefore rejects the positive claim that statements made about the external world can be known to be objectively true. Other varieties of relativism include cognitive relativism (the general claim that all truth and knowledge is relative) and Ethical Relativism (the claim that moral judgments are relative). Aesthetic and ethical relativism are sub-categories of Cognitive Relativism. Philosophers who have been influential in relativist thinking include David Hume, particularly his "radical scepticism" as set out in A Treatise of Human Nature; Thomas Kuhn, with regard to the history and philosophy of science, and particularly his work The Structure of Scientific Revolutions; Friedrich Nietzsche, in moral philosophy and epistemology; and Richard Rorty, on the contingency of language.

Philosophers who have given influential objectivist accounts include Plato, and in particular his Theory of the Forms; Immanuel Kant, who argued that the judgment of beauty, despite being subjective, is a universally practiced function of the mind; Noam Chomsky, whose "nativist" theory of linguistics argues for a universal grammar (i.e., that language is not as contingent as relativists have argued that it is).

The most prominent philosophical opponent of aesthetic relativism was Immanuel [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], who argued that the judgment of beauty, while subjective, is universal.

'''Bassam Tibi''' ({{lang-ar|بسام طيبي}}), is a German [[political science|political scientist]] and Professor of [[International Relations]]. He was born in 1944 in [[Damascus]], Syria to an aristocratic family,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Germany’s refugee anniversary: Assimilation report|url=https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21706329-year-after-angela-merkel-welcomed-migrants-two-syrians-differ-whether-integration-can|accessdate=3 September 2016|work=[[The Economist]]|date=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved to [[Germany]] in 1962 where he later became a citizen in 1976. He is known for his analysis of international relations{{vague|date=February 2017}} and the introduction of Islam to the study of international conflict and of civilization. Tibi is known for introducing the controversial concept of European ''[[Leitkultur]]'' as well as the concept of ''[[Euroislam]]'' to discussions about integration of Muslim immigrants to countries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;As Paul Berman in his book "The Flight of the Intellectuals" (Melville House 2010, p. 150) notes, "Bassam Tibi, the liberal, means by Euro-Islam a Westernized Islam. In contrast, Tariq Ramadan means a Salafi reformism, and not a Westernized Islam".&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also the founder of ''[[Islamology]]'' as a social-scientific study of Islam and conflict in post-bipolar politics. Tibi has done research in Asian and African countries. He publishes in English, German and Arabic.

== Academic career ==
He studied in [[Frankfurt am Main]] under [[Max Horkheimer]], obtaining his Ph.D. there in 1971, and later habilitated in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. From 1973 until his retirement in 2009, he was Professor for International Relations at [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen University]].

White Professor-at-Large at [[Cornell University]]. Tibi had eighteen visiting professorships in all continents including fellowships in [[Princeton University]], [[UC Berkeley]], [[University of Michigan-Ann Arbor]], and most recently (2010) at the [[Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies]], Washington D.C.

===On Islam===
Tibi is a [[Islam in Germany|Muslim]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/?content=20070329 Antisemitism | Voices on Antisemitism | Transcript&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630081107/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/?content=20070329 |date=June 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but criticizes Islamism and advocates [[Liberalism and progressivism within Islam|"reforming" Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,440340,00.html|title=Interview with German Islam Expert Bassam Tibi: "Europeans Have Stopped Defending Their Values"|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=2 October 2006|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tibi also suggests that Muslim immigrants should refrain from engaging in religious missionary activities, ''[[Dawah|Dawa]]''.&lt;ref name=tibi227&gt;{{cite book|author=Bassam Tibi|title=Islam between culture and politics|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year =2001|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Europe===
When it comes to Europe, Tibi distinguishes positive and negative elements of European culture. The positive ones are, according to Tibi, [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]], [[Cultural pluralism|pluralism]], [[civil rights]] and [[secularization]]. Tibi argues that there is a need for Europe to defend these values, especially in times of [[globalization]] and [[Human migration|migration]] from Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/interview-with-german-islam-expert-bassam-tibi-europeans-have-stopped-defending-their-values-a-440340.html|title=Interview with German Islam Expert Bassam Tibi: "Europeans Have Stopped Defending Their Values"|author=((SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany))|date=2 October 2006|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Tibi argues that [[racism]] is a European invention, and that Europeans must overcome what he calls "Euro-arrogance" and [[xenophobia]] to integrate immigrants.&lt;ref name=tibi227/&gt;

He criticizes [[Colonial empire|European imperialism]], arguing that it disrupted and deformed other cultures. Acknowledging that Muslim conquerors also did some wrong, Tibi argues that at least Muslim conquests were not driven by any kind of racism, unlike the European conquests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bassam Tibi|title=Islam between culture and politics|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year =2001|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On Germany ===
He has criticised the left-green dominated German media for stifling debate about Islam in Germany, leading to ordinary people being afraid to state their opinions. As an example he gives [[Uwe Tellkamp]], who expressed criticisim against the German policy of migration and was attacked in [[mainstream media]] and painted as a right-extremist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/die-islam-konferenz-ist-deutsche-unterwerfung-ld.1371525|title=«Der deutsche Staat kapituliert vor dem Islam» {{!}} NZZ|last=Neff|first=Benedict|date=2018-04-05|work=Neue Zürcher Zeitung|access-date=2018-04-07|language=de-CH|issn=0376-6829}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also criticised authorities in Germany for not standing up to the large organised Islamic community organisations like the [[Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs]] and for not supporting liberal Muslims like [[Seyran Ateş]] and [[Necla Kelek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/die-islam-konferenz-ist-deutsche-unterwerfung-ld.1371525|title=«Der deutsche Staat kapituliert vor dem Islam» {{!}} NZZ|last=Neff|first=Benedict|date=2018-04-05|work=Neue Zürcher Zeitung|access-date=2018-04-07|language=de-CH|issn=0376-6829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Israel===
Bassam Tibi has criticized the [[Likud]] party of Israel as blocking the peace process. He states that in the 1990s, the Likud adopted the "Three Nos" policy:&lt;ref name=mideast/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"No to the Palestinian State, no to dividing [[Jerusalem]], no to returning [[Golan Heights]] to Syria.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Tibi, the Likud government of 1996 engaged in provoking Arabs by constructing [[Har Homa]] in [[East Jerusalem|Arab Jerusalem]], and digging a tunnel under the [[Temple Mount]], and thereby exposing Israel to terrorism.&lt;ref name=mideast&gt;{{cite book|author=Bassam Tibi|title=Conflict and war in the Middle East: from interstate war to new security|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year =1998|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7469">'''Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia'''  is a [[learned society]] founded in 1947 at the [[University of Virginia]], [[Charlottesville]] to promote interest in books and manuscripts, maps, printing, the graphic arts, and bibliography and textual criticism.  The society sponsors exhibitions, contests for student book collectors and Virginia printers, an international speakers’ series, and an active publications program which has produced over 175 separate publication in addition to its journal ''Studies in Bibliography''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bsuva.org/wordpress/about/history/ Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, "History"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The society was led for many years by [[Fredson Bowers]], a University of Virginia faculty member, and was influential in applying and spreading the theories of [[textual criticism]] developed by Bowers and [[W. W. Greg]] which brought about changes in the study of manuscripts and the printing of books to ascertain the original intentions of authors. 

==History==
After several years of preparation, on February 26, 1947 a group met in the University of Virginia library in Charlottesville and adopted a constitution that declared the object of their new society to be "to foster an interest in books (including books in manuscript), maps, printing, and bibliography." The group called "The Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia." The inaugural address was given by Fredson Bowers, a member of the faculty, speaking on "Some Problems and Practices in Bibliographical Descriptions of Modern Authors," The leadership in the early years fell to Bowers, to John Cook Wyllie, and to Linton Massey. Bowers served as President in the Society's second and third years, 1948 and 1949, and then from its fifth year, 1951, up to 1974.{{sfnb|Vander Meulen|1997|p = [http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv050.xml;chunk.id=vol050.01.02;toc.depth=1;toc.id=vol050.01;brand=default 4-8]}} By the late 1960s, the Society had nearly 1,000 members. {{sfnb|Vander Meulen|1997|p = [http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv050.xml;chunk.id=vol050.01.02;toc.depth=1;toc.id=vol050.01;brand=default 70]}} Irby Cauthen, a charter member, became President in 1978. He was succeeded in 1993 by  [[G. Thomas Tanselle]], who was elected a Council member and President in 1993, only the second Council member from outside Charlottesville. Tanselle served as president of the society 1993-2006.{{sfnb|Vander Meulen|1997|p = [http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv050.xml;chunk.id=vol050.01.02;toc.depth=1;toc.id=vol050.01;brand=default 76]}}

==''Studies in Bibliography'' and other publications==
''The Papers of the Bibliographical Society'' of the University of Virginia was started in 1948 as an annual journal dedicated to the study of books as physical objects and to textual criticism and scholarly editing; Bowers served as the journal's editor until his death in 1991.{{sfnb|Tanselle|2009}}  It was renamed ''Studies in Bibliography'' for volume 2.{{sfnb|Vander Meulen|1997|p = [http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv050.xml;chunk.id=vol050.01.02;toc.depth=1;toc.id=vol050.01;brand=default 59-60, 67]}} Bowers conceived of the journal as one that encompassed all bibliographical study, with no restriction as to the geographical origins or periods or genres of the material examined. The topics of articles in Volume I (1948-1949), for instance, ranged from an unpublished manuscript by Thomas Jefferson, Elizabethan drama, and the use of watermarks as bibliographical evidence to catalogs issued by 16th century booksellers. &lt;ref&gt;[http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv001.xml Papers Volume I] &lt;/ref&gt; Volume III (1950) opened with four major essays on textual matters: R. C. Bald's "Editorial Problems--A Preliminary Survey," W. W. Greg's "The Rationale of Copy-Text," Bowers's "Some Relations of Bibliography to Editorial Problems," and Archibald A. Hill's "Some Postulates for Distributional Study of Texts." &lt;ref&gt;[http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv003.xml Papers Volume III] &lt;/ref&gt; G. Thomas Tanselle called Greg's article "one of the most seminal papers in the history of English scholarship." 
{{sfnb|Tanselle|1997| p = [http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv050.xml;chunk.id=vol050.03;toc.depth=1;toc.id=vol050.03;brand=default 142]}} Articles in later issues also discussed new technology, such as the [[Hinman collator]], which used lenses and mirrors to compare copies of a printed work in order to show the differences. Bowers promoted this technique for early printed works, such as the [[First Folio]]s of Shakespeare.

Book length publications range from bibliographies of contemporary authors such as [[Peter Matthew Hillsman Taylor|Peter Taylor]] and [[Hilda Doolittle]] (H.D.), to studies of Shakespearean promptbooks, with an especially large number of works on the problems and theory of textual editing, including collections of essays by Bowers and Tanselle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bsuva.org/wordpress/publications-2/publications/ Print Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, editorship of ''Studies in Bibliography'' passed to David L. Vander Meulen, a professor of English at the University of Virginia.{{sfnb|Tanselle|2009}}

'''''Brütal Legend''''' is an [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game with [[real-time strategy game]] elements created by [[Double Fine Productions]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]. The game was released during October 2009 in North America, Europe, and Australia. Though ''Brütal Legend'' was originally to be published by [[Vivendi Games]] prior to its merger with [[Activision]], Activision dropped the game from its portfolio after the merger. It was later picked up by Electronic Arts, though Activision and Double Fine brought counter-lawsuits against each other over publishing issues. The issues were settled out of court. Later, Double Fine announced a port of the game for [[Microsoft Windows]] via [[Steam (software)|Steam]], which was released in February 2013. Mac OS X and Linux versions of the game were made available as part of the [[Humble Bundle]] in May 2013. A physical collector's edition for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux was released by [[IndieBox]] in October 2014.

[[Tim Schafer]], the game's creative director, was inspired to create the game by his own past musical experiences. The game features the character of Eddie Riggs, voiced by and modeled after [[Jack Black]], a [[roadie]] who is transported to a fantasy world inspired by the artwork of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] album covers. Eddie becomes the world's savior, leading the down-trodden humans against a range of supernatural overlords using a [[battle axe]], his [[Gibson Flying V|Flying V]] guitar that can tap into the magical powers of the world, and a customizable [[hot rod]].

The game, a hybrid of the [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] and [[real-time strategy game|real-time strategy]] genres, includes Stage Battles in both the single-player and multiplayer mode, where the player must command troops to defeat their foes while defending their own stage. In addition to Black, the game features voices of heavy metal musicians including [[Lemmy|Lemmy Kilmister]], [[Rob Halford]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Lita Ford]] and other celebrities such as [[Tim Curry]], as well as more than one hundred metal songs selected by Schafer for inclusion in the game.

''Brütal Legend'' was generally well received by game reviewers, praising Schafer's vision and writing of the heavy metal-inspired world, and the performances of the voice cast, particularly Black and Osbourne. Some felt that the hybrid gameplay of action and real-time strategy games did not mix well, however, blaming console control limitations and missing features normally found in games of either genre.

''Brütal Legend'' is a third person action/adventure game incorporating [[real time strategy]] elements.&lt;ref name="1up preview"/&gt; The game uses an [[open world]] that [[Tim Schafer]] has described as being approximately {{convert|40|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} in area.&lt;ref name="1up preview"/&gt; The player controls the protagonist Eddie Riggs, a [[roadie]] who one day finds himself transported into a heavy metal-themed fantasy world. Eddie acquires three tools that are used for combat and transportation: a broad axe called "The Separator", his [[Gibson Flying V|Flying V]] guitar "Clementine" from his own world which has the ability to cast magic spells in the heavy metal world, and a [[hot rod]] that Eddie builds called "The Druid Plow", a.k.a. "The Deuce".&lt;ref name="1up preview"/&gt; Spells, referred to as "Solos", from Clementine are performed by playing a [[minigame]] akin to the note-matching aspect of ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' or ''[[Rock Band]]'' over a brief [[guitar riff]]; however, Eddie cannot use the metal generated by Clementine constantly, as prolonged usage of the guitar will cause it to [[Thermal shock|overheat]], and the player will have to wait for a cool-off period before using the guitar's power again.&lt;ref name="joystiq preview"/&gt; Eddie may also find more solos hidden throughout the world, ranging from support to offensive spells. The player can spend in-game currency called "[[Lighter|Fire Tributes]]", earned from completing missions, at the Motor Forge to gain new abilities and upgrades for each tool.&lt;ref name="gi sept 09"&gt;{{cite news | title = Brutal Legend | publisher = [[Game Informer]] |date = September 2009| pages = 48–51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These tools can be used in combination with each other to take out Eddie's foes; for example, the player can use his guitar Clementine to create [[pyrotechnics]] to launch a foe into the air and follow up by attack it with the Separator axe. In a case of a specific [[boss (video games)|boss fight]], the player must use the Deuce hot rod to lure the boss to a spiked gate held up by counterweights, and then play the "Earthshaker" move on Clementine to destroy the weights and sever the creature's head.&lt;ref name="1up preview"/&gt;

Within the open world, the player can use a map and the Deuce's turn signals to guide them towards either story-advancing missions or side missions. Side missions include hot-rod races against a demon, defending Eddie's allies from a pending attack, or helping a cannon operator spot his targets. There are about 23 main missions in the story with 30 side missions that the player can optionally take.&lt;ref name="1up preview"/&gt;  The player can also explore the game's world to find statues bound in leather or chains that can be freed to gain a health boost for Eddie or to reveal part of the game's backstory, and can look through special telescopes at vistas or complete certain jumps to earn additional Fire Tributes. The player can also find monuments they can raise that unlock an additional heavy metal song from the game's soundtrack that can be played on the Deuce's radio, "The Mouth of Metal"; the player can further customize its set list with songs they have been rewarded with or have collected.&lt;ref name="1up preview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eurogamer livechat"/&gt;

[[File:Bl-stage-battle.jpg|thumb|right|The single-player and multiplayer modes of ''Brütal Legend'' feature Stage Battles where players command armies to defend their concert stage while attacking others' stages.|alt=Screenshot showing a giant concert stage dominating the background, accented by gothic elements such as towering spires; the foreground shows several forces converging on the stage, including a flying winged creature, two people mounted on bear-like creatures, a giant brute, and several other ground forces.]]
Several main story missions of the game are Stage Battles based on [[real time strategy]] elements. The player, while still in control of Eddie, is required to defend a giant stage where new allies will spawn, holding out until a specific objective is completed. The player creates an army for attacks by building merchandise booths on "fan geysers" through Clementine's magic. Once enough fans are collected, the player can summon different allies, each consuming a specific number of fans, or upgrade their stage to allow them to produce more powerful allies. A character known as Mangus acts as the "sound guy" to help in the construction of these units and stage upgrades, and also warns the player of enemy attacks.&lt;ref name="joystiq preview"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.joystiq.com/2009/05/14/joystiq-impressions-redux-brutal-legend/ | title = Joystiq impressions redux: Brutal Legend | first = Kevin | last = Kelly | date = May 14, 2009 | access-date = May 15, 2009 | publisher = Joystiq}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the player has gathered their army, they can then seek out and attack their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://kotaku.com/5254842/brutal-legend-battle-of-the-bands-with-axes-real-axes | title = Brutal Legend: Battle of the Bands...

Ultimately, Eddie transforms into a winged demon who can fly above the battlefields to issue orders or lay out attacks.&lt;ref name="joystiq preview"/&gt; Spells in Eddie's arsenal can help control the performance of his armies, such as temporarily boosting their attack skills or creating a rally flag which troops will gather at, while others hinder the performance of the enemy faction by removing enemy buffs or preventing the creation of enemy units for a short time. Each of the different units, including special allies that Eddie meets in the game, has a special co-op move they can perform with Eddie; for example, Eddie's first ally, Ophelia, can be tossed at foes by Eddie in the style of the Fastball Special. These co-op moves are also available outside of Stage Battle missions.&lt;ref name="1up preview"/&gt;

The game has a multiplayer mode, described by Schafer as "your typical head-to-head, battle of the bands scenario. But with axes."&lt;ref name="1up preview"/&gt; The multiplayer modes are team-based and play in the same manner as the single-player Stage Battles, with team sizes from one-versus-one to four-versus-four.&lt;ref name="eurogamer livechat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://xbox360.gamespy.com/xbox-360/brutal-legend/1004771p1.html | title = Brutal Legend's Multiplayer Skirmish Mode | publisher = [[GameSpy]] | date = July 17, 2009 | access-date = July 17, 2009 | first = Bryn | last = Williams }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each team selects from one of three factions which affect what resources and troops they can summon, and are tasked with defending their stage from attack by the other team. The three factions available are Ironheade, mostly human-based troops led by Eddie Riggs; The Drowning Doom, with more Goth/Black Metal creatures led by Ophelia; and The Tainted Coil, evil creatures controlled by Doviculus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/101/1013424p1.html | title = Brutal Legend Multiplayer Hands-On | publisher = IGN | date = August 13, 2009 | access-date = August 14, 2009 | first = Hilary | last = Goldstein }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each player controls a single main avatar who has the same abilities as in the main game for combat and magic spells and can also fly about the map, but also is in control of troops that they may summon from the team's shared resources—fans as generated by fan geysers across the map.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=1176 | title = Brutal Legend Multiplayer Impressions: Whoa! | first = Nick | last = Breckon | date = August 13, 2009 | access-date = August 15, 2009 | publisher = [[Shacknews]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090815131342/http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=1176 | archivedate = August 15, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different types of troops are available, costing various numbers of fans to summon, with the potential to upgrade to improved units through different routes. The number and types of troops that can be summoned is limited by a cap to prevent either team from becoming too overpowered. All of the troops can be engaged by the player to initiate various "Double Team" moves as with the single player game. The game can also be played by a single player with computer-controller opponents at one of five difficulty levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2009/08/13/brutal-legend-multiplayer-is-an-rts-that-works/ | title = Brutal Legend multiplayer is a console RTS that works | first = Gieson | last = Cacho | date = August 13, 2009 | access-date = August 15, 2009 | publisher = [[San Jose Mercury News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Characters===
''Brütal Legend'' follows the story of Eddie Riggs (voiced by [[Jack Black]]), who is "the world's best [[road crew|roadie]]" for "the world's ''worst'' '[[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]' band", Kabbage Boy.&lt;ref name="1up preview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku kabbage boy"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://kotaku.com/5360804/brutal-legend-introducing-kabbage-boy | title = Brutal Legend: Introducing Kabbage Boy | first = Mike | last = Fahey | date = September 16, 2009 | access-date = September 16, 2009 | publisher = Kotaku }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the game takes place in an unnamed world inspired by heavy metal music, created by, according to the game's mythology, Ormagöden, The Eternal Firebeast, Cremator of the Sky, and Destroyer of the Ancient World.&lt;ref name="1up preview"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3173567| title=Brutal Legend (Xbox 360) | first = Thierry | last = Nguyen | date = April 3, 2009 | access-date=April 3, 2009 | publisher = [[1UP.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this alternate world, the human race is enslaved by a race of demons, led by Doviculus, Emperor of the Tainted Coil, (voiced by [[Tim Curry]]). Doviculus is assisted by his [[glam metal]] human minion, General Lionwhyte (voiced by [[Rob Halford]] and based on [[David Bowie]] with the name being an allusion to glammetal band [[White Lion]]) whose hair is so big "and luscious" that he uses it to fly, flapping it like a pair of broad wings.&lt;ref name="usatoday characters 2"/&gt; Leading the fight against Doviculus are a small band of human resistance fighters with whom Eddie joins forces: Lars Halford (voiced by [[Zach Hanks]]), his sister Lita (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]), and Ophelia (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]), whom Eddie takes a romantic interest in. Their group is later joined by the stage manager Mangus ([[Alex Fernandez (actor)|Alex Fernandez]]), the bass-playing healer Kill Master (voiced by, and patterned after [[Lemmy|Lemmy Kilmister]]),&lt;ref name="usatoday characters 1"/&gt; the motorcycle-riding Fire Baron (also voiced by Halford, as well as visually inspired by him too),&lt;ref name="usatoday characters 2"/&gt; and the Amazonian Rima (voiced by [[Lita Ford]] and based on [[KISS (band)|KISS]] characters).&lt;ref name="usatoday characters 2"/&gt; Also supporting Eddie is the Guardian of Metal (voiced by [[Ozzy Osbourne]], who also lent his appearance to the character) that assists in upgrading his equipment.&lt;ref name="usatoday characters 1"/&gt;

===Plot===
During a gig for Kabbage Boy, Eddie is crushed by falling scenery while trying to save a member of the band; his blood lands on his belt buckle, in reality an amulet for Ormagöden. The stage is transformed into Ormagöden, who kills the band and takes the unconscious Eddie to the heavy metal world. Awaking in the Temple of Ormagöden, Eddie meets with Ophelia while fighting Doviculus' forces, developing a crush on her. They discover writings left by the Titans that Eddie is able to comprehend, and build a hot-rod, the "Deuce", that they use to escape the Temple and travel to Bladehenge, the base for the small human resistance force led by Lars and Lita. When they meet Eddie and learn he can understand the Titans' messages, they see him as a prophetical "Chosen One", though unsure if he will be the savior or destroyer of the world.&lt;ref name="gi sept 09"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2009/05/04/tim-schafer-takes-us-on-a-tour-of-brutal-legend/ | title = Tim Schafer takes us on a tour of Brutal Legend | publisher = [[San Jose Mercury News]] | date = May 4, 2009 | access-date = May 4, 2009 | first = Gieson | last = Cacho }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ophelia also becomes concerned when Eddie, in the heat of battle, transforms into a winged creature, an effect Eddie decides to use to his advantage at the time.

Eddie helps Lars, Lita, and Ophelia create an army, named "Ironheade" to fight against General Lionwhyte.&lt;ref name="1up preview"/&gt; They successfully raid Lionwhyte's "Pleasure Tower" and defeat him. However, as they celebrate, Doviculus arrives, sending the group into hiding. Doviculus is aware of the presence of his spy "Succoria" by the smell of her blood as it was at the Temple; Eddie and his allies come to believe Ophelia is Doviculus' spy. Lars leaves his hiding spot to face Doviculus, but is quickly killed. As the Tainted Coil destroy the tower, Ironheade escapes into the nearby mountains; Eddie is forced to leave with Lita leaving Ophelia behind despite their shared love. Heartbroken, Ophelia is drawn toward the Sea of Black Tears, cursed waters that grant humans supernatural abilities at the cost of humanity. After leaping into the black waters, the Sea creates a dark [[doppelganger]] of Ophelia, who raises an army of other Black Tear-corrupted humans, the [[Goth subculture|goth]] "Drowning Doom". After three months, she leads an attack on Ironheade's mountain camp. Though Ironheade defeats the assault, Eddie determines they must destroy the Sea to end her threat. As they travel through exotic lands and find more allies out of the pyromanical Fire Barons and the amazonian Zaulia tribe, they come across evidence of Eddie's father, the hero known as Riggnarok in this time. It tells that Riggnarok traveled to the future to attempt to learn the secrets of the Titans to bring back to the past in the humans' ongoing fight against the demons, but never returned.

With their new allies, Ironheade manages to push the Drowning Doom back towards the Sea of Black Tears; defeated, Ophelia denies Eddie's belief that she is Doviculus' spy, again claiming that Eddie's the traitor. As they argue, Doviculus arrives and confirms that Succoria is not Ophelia, but Eddie's mother. In the past, Succoria, an even more vicious demon empress, also sought the Titans' secrets in the future. However, after discovering that [[humans]] eventually become the dominant species, Succoria fell into a deep despair. Riggnarok, who had followed Succoria through time to assassinate her, took pity on her in her misery, and the two fell in love and bore Eddie. Now in the past, Eddie's demon nature has borne out, and has also inadvertently revealed the Titans' secrets to Doviculus as well. Having no more use for Ophelia, Doviculus rips out her heart, taking her powers alongside his own and causing Ophelia to dissipate. While Ironheade battles Doviculus' forces, Eddie engages Doviculus in a one-on-one confrontation, which ends with the demon emperor's [[decapitation]]. As Eddie escapes the Sea, he recovers Ophelia's heart from Doviculus, containing his mother's necklace he gave her when they first met, and then proceeds to rescue the real Ophelia from the ocean floor. Ashore, they rekindle their love as Ironheade celebrates their victory over Doviculus and the Tainted Coil. Back at Bladehenge, a statue to Lars is erected, while Lita continues to lead the troops against the remaining demons. Eddie insists on maintaining his "roadie" presence, staying behind the scenes and making others look good. After he promises he is not leaving to his assembled friends, Eddie takes off to complete a few errands, with Ophelia watching as he drives off into the sunset, shedding a single black tear.

Creator Tim Schafer has said that he has been a [[heavy metal music]] fan since high school, and roadies have long fascinated him.&lt;ref name="oxm preview"&gt;{{cite news|title=The OXM 100|date=February 2009|publisher=[[Official Xbox Magazine]]|pages=18–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Schafer said in 2007, "The name was one of the very first things I thought of, over fifteen years ago. I was riding a bus, thinking about a game that would be the complete opposite of what we were working on, ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]'' [a [[LucasArts|Lucasfilm Games]] title released in 1990].

The idea behind the game first came to Schafer about fifteen years prior to its release, but its core concepts did not completely come together until after the completion of ''[[Psychonauts]]'' (2005), when he presented his idea for the game to the team, they became excited at the concept and decided to make that their next title.&lt;ref name="eurog-interview-2009"/&gt;

[[File:Tim Schafer Art Futura 2009.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''Brütal Legend'' was based on the creative inspiration of Tim Schafer, founder of Double Fine studios.]]

Part of the game's inspiration came from the fantasy worlds that the lyrics and album covers of metal bands implied but rarely made it to [[music video]]s, thus allowing ''Brütal Legend'' to "fulfill the promise" of such lore.&lt;ref name="oxm preview"/&gt; Schafer also credits a [[Megadeth]] roadie named Tony he once met as having given him the idea to make a game about a roadie, with the character of Eddie Riggs becoming a re-imagined version of him.&lt;ref name="1up scheffer profile"/&gt; Schafer had previously explored the idea of a roadie sent back in time with the character of Hoagie from ''[[Day of the Tentacle]]'', but ''Brütal Legend'' represented an opportunity to expand on it further.&lt;ref name="gi interview"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/ec69be31-fb44-4607-a802-ed956a6482cb.htm |title=We Chat With The Mind Behind Grim Fandango, Psychonauts and Brütal Legend |first=Meagan |last=Van Burkleo |date=July 29, 2009 |access-date=July 29, 2009 |publisher=[[Game Informer]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804040556/http://www.gameinformer.com/NR/exeres/ec69be31-fb44-4607-a802-ed956a6482cb.htm |archivedate=August 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 movie ''[[School of Rock]]'' also reminded Schafer of his idea for ''Brütal Legend'', and made him more excited to publish it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.vg247.com/2009/05/13/brutal-legend-we-didnt-think-wed-get-jack-black-says-schafer/ | title = Brutal Legend: We didn’t think we’d get Jack Black, says Schafer | date = May 13, 2009 | access-date = May 13, 2009 | first = Patrick | last = Garrett | publisher = VG247 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Double Fine's philosophy on game development was also another reason for ''Brütal Legend'''s creation, as Schafer has stated that his team attempts to make each game radically different from the company's previous release, contrasting ''Brütal Legend'' to ''Psychonauts''.&lt;ref name="mtv sales"&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2009/04/06/tim-schafer-gamers-worry-too-much-about-sales/|title=Tim Schafer: Gamers Worry Too Much About Sales|first=Stephan|last=Totilo|publisher=MTV|date=April 6, 2009|access-date=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schafer stated that the commercial tie-ins of ''Brütal Legend'', such as "hot babes and Jack Black", is due to this philosophy and not due to market pressures. Schafer was not concerned about the commercial success of ''Brütal Legend'', as despite poor sales of ''Psychonauts'', "as long as you make a cool game, publishers want to talk to you".&lt;ref name="mtv sales"/&gt; When Schafer was pitching the game before 2006, he received feedback about changing the game's style to [[hip hop]] or [[country music|country]]. He credits [[Harmonix Music Systems]] for influencing the [[rhythm game]] market through the release of the widely successful ''[[Guitar Hero (video game)|Guitar Hero]]'' with a soundtrack that heavily emphasized metal music; with the popularity of ''Guitar Hero'', the metal approach in ''Brütal Legend'' was readily accepted.&lt;ref name="oxm preview"/&gt;

Schafer has pointed out that there are music term inspired attacks, such as a "Face-Melting" guitar solo, which literally will melt the foe's faces off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/832/832903p1.html | title = Brutal Legend - Tim Schafer AU Interview | first = Patch | last = Kolan | date = November 6, 2007 | access-date= January 13, 2010 | publisher = IGN }}&lt;/ref&gt; The metal/motorcyclist lifestyles and [[Norse mythology]] also inspired the game's open-world environments, such as amps carved into the face of a mountain, a forest where tires replace leaves, giant axes and swords piercing the ground, spandex covered temples, and mining facilities where human slaves excavated car and motorcycle parts. However, Schafer noted that they attempted to make sure that non-metal fans would be able to get the jokes as well.&lt;ref name="oxm preview"/&gt;

===Art design===

Signature elements of Eddie's vest, crew pass, and cigarette remained part of the character redesign.}}
The art style for the game was based on the work of [[Frank Frazetta]] and inspired by heavy metal and [[rock music|rock]] [[album cover]]s.&lt;ref name="oxm preview"/&gt; The team only considered the addition of elements to the artwork if they felt it would be something that could be seen on such covers.&lt;ref name="oxm preview"/&gt; The setting includes [[hot rod]]-like engines that grow from the earth like a "V8 Truffle Of Speed", with design inspired by the designs of [[Ed Roth|Ed "Big Daddy" Roth]].&lt;ref name="gdc art"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=22954|title=GDC: The Art Of Brutal Legend|first=Leigh|last=Alexander|date=March 28, 2009|access-date=March 28, 2009|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art team wanted to avoid creating "another brown-gray game", and strove to use the wide color palettes that are associated with heavy metal art.&lt;ref name="gdc art"/&gt; [[Cutscene]]s in the game use the game's [[game engine|engine]], though some pre-recorded scenes from the engine have also been prepared with the help of Tasha Harris, a former [[Pixar]] employee who helped to animate character's faces during cutscenes.&lt;ref name="gi sept 09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eurogamer livechat"/&gt;

The game features over 80 unique characters in addition to the main protagonist, Eddie Riggs.&lt;ref name="gdc art"/&gt; Initial designs for Riggs was modeled after [[Lemmy|Lemmy Kilmister]], and though the model was changed, the signature vest, tour pass and cigarette of the character remained part of the character design.&lt;ref name="gdc art"/&gt; As the character continued to develop, they began to add more aspects of Black's character, an "enthusiastic fan" of music, from ''School of Rock''.&lt;ref name="gi interview"/&gt; Ultimately, Riggs' design came to become half Jack Black and half [[Glenn Danzig]].&lt;ref name="oxm preview"/&gt; The art team was able to use videos of Black's performances to add additional features to the character, such as "all his crazy eyebrow stuff he does".&lt;ref name="gi interview"/&gt; General Lionwhyte, who has "fabulous hair", and his minions are based on the [[glam metal]] fad of the 1980s which displaced heavy metal to the disappointment of Schafer and other development team members, and became the opponents of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/982/982678p1.html | title = Pre-E3 2009: Brutal Legend Update | first = Daemon | last = Hatfield | date = May 16, 2009 | access-date = May 16, 2009 | publisher = IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help create a more mature game with concepts that could be used to pitch the game, the art team created several factions that represented different parts of the heavy metal experience. Each faction had their own "exaggerated, simplified shapes and strong silhouettes" as to help distinguish each faction while also reducing the development costs.&lt;ref name="gdc art"/&gt; Inspirations for such factions include [[Norsemen|Nordic imagery]], [[gothic metal|goth metal]], and the artwork of [[Hieronymus Bosch]].&lt;ref name="gdc art"/&gt; Additional characters include headbangers, "gravediggers", and "battle nuns".&lt;ref name="gdc art"/&gt; As the game features over two hours of spoken dialog, the art team wants to make the characters' faces and performances stand out, creating "clean, easy-to-read faces". The team had to change from their initial cartoony textures into more detailed ones that stood out on high-definition displays while exaggerating other features of the characters.&lt;ref name="gdc art"/&gt;

The user interface and menus were created by Joe Kowalski, who had previously worked on similar game elements for ''[[Guitar Hero (video game)|Guitar Hero]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero II]]'', and the ''[[Rock Band]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://kotaku.com/5546365/creating-some-of-the-best-video-game-menus-ever | title = Creating Some Of The Best Video Game Menus Ever | publisher = Kotaku | date = May 24, 2010 | access-date =May 25, 2010 | first = Mikey | last = Fahey }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the game's interface elements used a medieval [[woodcut]] art style, and were designed to contrast well against the world's graphics.

''Brütal Legend'' includes over 35,000 lines of spoken dialog, mostly written by Schafer.&lt;ref name="eurog-interview-2010"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/double-fines-tim-schafer-develop-interview | title = Double Fine's Tim Schafer | first = Wesley | last = Yin-Poole | date = July 14, 2010 | access-date = July 14, 2010 | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Black, Lemmy, [[Judas Priest]]'s Rob Halford, [[The Runaways]]' Lita Ford, and Ozzy Osbourne provide character voices for these lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1608468/story.jhtml|title='Brutal Legend': The Most Absurd Heavy Metal Game Ever?|date=April 3, 2009|access-date=April 3, 2009|first=Stephan|last=Totilo|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58913 |title=Ozzy Osbourne Joins Brutal Legend Cast |date=June 1, 2009 |access-date=June 1, 2009 |publisher=[[Shacknews]] |first=Nick |last=Breckon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schafer's original vision for the game had not anticipated a celebrity cast.&lt;ref name="rps schafer pc"/&gt; In particular, though Eddie came to resemble Black, the team had not planned on having Jack Black voice the character. After learning that Black was a fan of Schafer's previous game, ''Psychonauts'', they met with the [[actor]]/[[musician]] and recognized he was an avid [[gamer]] and metal fan and understood all the choices the team made in the game, and subsequently signed on for the [[voice acting|voice work]].&lt;ref name="oxm preview"/&gt; Black also performed live-action sequences as himself used for the in-game menu screens and additional promotional material.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; Once Black had signed up for the project, Schafer found that other artists and people involved in the heavy metal scene became very interested in participating though a [[domino effect]] and word of mouth, allowing Schafer to sign them on as voice talent or as part of the game's soundtrack.&lt;ref name="rps schafer pc"/&gt;

Lemmy was brought on board to play The Kill Master after Schafer and his team had developed the character's role in the story who assists Eddie by healing his allies through a giant [[bass guitar|bass]] harp on the back of a [[chopper (motorcycle)|chopper]]. The original character, a man with a top hat and beard, was considered out of place by Schafer, leading him to consider famous bass guitar players and quickly recognizing the need to have Lemmy play that role.&lt;ref name="usatoday characters 2"/&gt; Halford plays two characters, General Lionwhyte and The Baron. Schafer had selected Lionwhyte to capture Halford's ability to scream, and found his abilities in the studio beyond what they expected. They created The Baron character specifically for Halford, as while Lionwhyte was considered a "heavy metal [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] [from ''[[Family Guy]]'']", that character was the complete opposite of Halford, while The Baron captures both Halford and Judas Priest's attitude.&lt;ref name="usatoday characters 2"/&gt; Lita Ford voices Rima, queen of a group of "Amazon-like jungle women"; Schafer considered the similarities between the lack of clothing that Rima was designed with and Ford's outfits from the 1980s, staying true to the development teams' memories of her.&lt;ref name="usatoday characters 2"/&gt; Osbourne plays The Guardian of Metal who helps the player upgrade their equipment; Schafer commented that both the character and Osbourne, while dark and brooding, are "really upbeat" and "optimistic".&lt;ref name="usatoday characters 1"&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2009-10-12-brutal-legend-characters_N.htm?loc=interstitialskip | title = Heavy-metal royalty help 'Brutal Legend' spring to life | work = [[USA Today]] | date = October 13, 2009 | access-date =October 13, 2009 | first = Mike | last = Snider }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jack Black 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Eddie Riggs' character is partly modeled after [[Jack Black]], who provides the voice for Eddie.|alt=A photograph of Jack Black, in casual clothes, holding an acoustic guitar while on stage.]]

Though [[Ronnie James Dio]] of the band [[Dio (band)|Dio]] had performed parts for the game, his role was replaced with voice work from [[Tim Curry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=121899|title=RONNIE JAMES DIO No Longer Part Of 'Brütal Legend' Game|last=|first=|date=June 14, 2009|website=|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615183123/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=121899|archive-date=2009-06-15|dead-url=yes|access-date=June 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the change was speculated to be due to tense issues between Osbourne and Dio, Schafer noted that as Dio's intended character, "Doviculus, Emperor of the Tainted Coil", grew, they found that Curry fit the role better for the part, citing Curry's role of the [[Lord of Darkness]] in the film ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'' as a key factor;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://kotaku.com/5291718/tim-schafer-explains-why-dios-out-of-brutal-legend-tim-currys-in | title = Tim Schafer Explains Why Dio's Out Of Brütal Legend, Tim Curry's In | first= Michael | last = McWhertor | date = June 15, 2009 | access-date = June 15, 2009 | publisher = Kotaku}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schafer would also later state that Dio's part was cut due to a combination of "really complicated reasons" and other circumstances outside their control.&lt;ref name="rps schafer pc"/&gt; Curry considered the role "perfect" for him when Schafer described Doviculus to him as "big and tough, but also has this kinky side who, when hit with an ax, might scream in pain or squeal with delight".&lt;ref name="usatoday characters 1"/&gt;

Similar to their experience with bringing Black onto the project, obtaining the voicework of the metal artists were also unexpected but beneficial.&lt;ref name="eurogamer livechat"/&gt; This led to some confusion during voice recording sessions; both Lita Ford and Rob Halford had difficulties with lines involving a character named "Lita Halford".&lt;ref name="eurogamer livechat"/&gt; Furthermore, both Black and Osbourne frequently injected [[profanity]] into their scripted lines during recording sessions. Instead of rerecording these, the development left these in the game, but included the option for a profanity content filter to be enabled by the player to "bleep" out these words and mask such word on screen using the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] "[[Parental Advisory]]" label, an icon that Schafer considered to be part of the history of heavy metal.  A similar filter exists for [[Graphic violence|gore]] in the game, preventing any dismemberment and disabling blood in the game. Schafer stated the filters were added to the game in consideration of older players that may not wish to see such aspects, or for parents who opt to play the game with younger children.&lt;ref name="planet360 interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetxbox360.com/article_7230/Tim_Schafer_-_Brutal_Legend_Interview |title=Tim Schafer - Brutal Legend Interview |first=James |last=Pikover |date=July 30, 2009 |website=Planet Xbox 360 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804150833/http://www.planetxbox360.com/article_7230/Tim_Schafer_-_Brutal_Legend_Interview |archive-date=August 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During development, Schafer stated that while he could not confirm what other musicians and bands would be in the game, there would be more than already stated, and that these musicians were "especially conducive to character creation" due to the amount of theatrics used in their concert shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2009-04-02-schafer-q-and-a_N.htm|title='Brutal Legend' is all part of Tim Schafer's rock 'n' roll fantasy|publisher=[[USA Today]] | first=Mike | last=Snider | date=April 3, 2009 | access-date=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development history===
According to Schafer, ''Brütal Legend'' had been in development since 2007, prior to the completion of ''Psychonauts''.&lt;ref name="oxm preview"/&gt; Schafer noted that in ''Psychonauts'', they attempted to bring together a lot of assets, including characters and environments, but were not able to successfully integrate them on their first attempt and had to start over on the development of some. In several cases for ''Psychonauts'', changes made in gameplay required them to return and redesign levels to account for the new features. The company decided at the start to use the [[scrum (development)|scrum development approach]] for ''Brütal Legend'', which they found worked well with their company's culture, allowing them to quickly arrive at playable targets at every milestone.&lt;ref name="postmortem"&gt;{{Cite web| url =  http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4308/postmortem_double_fines_brutal_.php | title = Postmortem: Double Fine's Brutal Legend | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = March 25, 2009 | access-date = May 25, 2010 | first = Caroline | last = Esmurdoc }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the team was able to bring about their terrain engine, renderer, and a playable Eddie Riggs within a month of development, and by the third month, the ability for Eddie to drive about the terrain, running over hordes of enemies.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt;

Schafer stated that they began the development with the character of Eddie, and recognizing what he should be doing in the game—specifically, swinging around his axe, playing his guitar, and driving his hot rod. Once they found this combination of elements to work well in combat and general gameplay, they were able to expand out the rest of the game from there, as these elements provided a means of testing the game to make sure it remained enjoyable.&lt;ref name="shacknews schaffer pax"/&gt; The first major feature developed for the game was the multiplayer element, given that no previous game from Double Fine had included this feature, and was the highest risk element to the game.&lt;ref name="planet360 interview"/&gt;
The multiplayer gameplay itself was inspired by older strategy games, in particular, 1989's ''[[Herzog Zwei]]''; in this game, the player controlled a transforming aircraft [[mecha]] that would normally fly about the field to issue orders for constructing new units, airlifting units to other areas, and directing combat, but the player could opt to transform the craft into a giant robot and engage directly in combat.&lt;ref name="rps schafer pc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/02/27/the-past-present-and-future-of-brutal-legend/ | title = The Past, Present, And Future Of Brutal Legend | first = Nathan | last = Greyson | date = February 27, 2013 | access-date = February 28, 2013 | publisher = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="strategy faq"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.doublefine.com/news/comments/battle_time/ | title = Battle Time | publisher = [[Double Fine]] | date =October 14, 2009 | access-date = October 15, 2009 | first = Tim | last = Schafer }}&lt;/ref&gt; For ''Brütal Legend'', Schafer kept the same concept of a split-mode RTS, but wanted more focus on the ground combat; instead of spending 90% of the time controlling units as in ''Zwei'', the player would only spend about 30% in this fashion within ''Brütal Legend''.&lt;ref name="rps schafer pc"/&gt; This subsequently led to much of the action and combat-driven gameplay outside of the stage battles.&lt;ref name="rps schafer pc"/&gt; In a 2015 interview, Schafer said that much of the gameplay outside of stage battles were to provide tutorials for the Stage Battles, and to make the game more of an action-adventure than an RTS to avoid the stigma that impacts sales of RTS games. This caused the production to expand considerably around the merger of Vivendi-Activision, and Double Fine had difficulties convincing the new publishers to fund the expanded game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.usgamer.net/articles/Tim_Schafer_Interview/ | title = "I Don't Know if a Duck is Going to Swallow me Whole." The Tim Schafer Interview. | first = Jaz | last = Ringell | date = June 22, 2015 | access-date = June 22, 2015 | publisher = [[US Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team used [[Unreal Engine]] 2.5 to build and test prototypes of the real-time strategy elements, allowing the designers and gameplay programmers to commence work while another team focused on creating a new game engine.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; Having completed the multiplayer stage battle portion of the game first, Double Fine found it easy to gradually introduce the player to its more advanced aspects during the single-player campaign.&lt;ref name="shacknews schaffer pax"/&gt; The game-world's large size and varied content necessitated a game engine with streaming capabilities, allowing the game to seamlessly load and unload content as needed — this was also something the team had no prior experience with.&lt;ref name="planet360 interview"/&gt; Double Fine developed several in-house tools to help streamline the content-creation process for the game's world: an automated testing bot, RoBert (so named after one of the test engineers), was created to put daily builds of the game through continuous and rigorous testing, automatically reporting any errors to developers, while the Multi-User-Editor allowed the game's artists to simultaneously work on the game-world without fear of overwriting each other's work.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; The team ran into content management issues late in the game's development as more of the game's assets neared completion. Within the span of a few months the combined asset size tripled, endangering the game's ability to fit on a [[DVD]] and causing performance problems throughout the company's development systems. With the help of the engineering team, they were eventually able to overcome the performance issues and re-optimize the content for space.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt;

With the popularity of the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' and ''[[Rock Band]]'' franchises, many wondered if ''Brütal Legend'' would take advantage of these games' guitar-themed controllers. Schafer mentioned that while he had entertained the idea, he could not find an acceptable way for players to repeatedly switch between standard and guitar controllers, so he abandoned it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2009/04/03/no-plans-for-brutal-legend-guitar-controller-compatibility/ |title='No Plans' For 'Brutal Legend' Guitar Controller Compatibility |first=Tracey |last=John |date=April 3, 2009 |website=MTV |access-date=April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players who preordered the game through [[GameStop]] were able to unlock a special promotional in-game guitar designed in conjunction with Jack Black's band Tenacious D, and includes voices provided by both Black and Kyle Gass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://kotaku.com/5242412/gamestops-exclusive-brutal-legend-tenacious-d-axe | title = GameStop's Exclusive Brütal Legend Tenacious D Axe | publisher = Kotaku | first = Mike | last = Fahey | date = May 6, 2009 | access-date = May 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''Brütal Legend''{{'}}s fate was unclear, Schafer was not able to talk about the project to avoid causing problems with any potential business deals, until EA Partners picked up the game in December 2008.&lt;ref name="oxm preview"/&gt; However, even when the fate of the publication of the game was unsure, the team continued to work on its development.&lt;ref name="escapist interview"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_182/5614-Backstage-with-Tim-Schafer|title=Backstage with Tim Schafer|date=December 30, 2008|access-date=April 1, 2009|first=Jordan|last=Deam|publisher=The Escapist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schafer reflected that the time spent during development without a publisher was beneficial, allowing them to design the game without pressure from the publisher's goals.&lt;ref name="eurog-interview-2010"/&gt; EA CEO John Riccitiello, when asked about EA picking up ''Brütal Legend'' for distribution prior to December 2008, commented that "Sometimes significant creative risks end up being some of the world’s best products".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=20652|title=Interview: EA's Riccitiello On Having Faith In Mirror's Edge, Grasshopper Manufacture|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|first=Leigh|last=Alexander|date=October 18, 2008|access-date=April 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other platforms===
When rumors of a possible Wii port arose in March 2009, Schafer stated that "We are making an Xbox 360 and a PS3 version of Brütal Legend."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3173511|title=Is Brütal Legend Coming to Wii?|last=Leone|first=Matt|date=March 30, 2009|website=|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013092302/http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3173511|archive-date=2012-10-13|dead-url=yes|access-date=April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Ben Fritz at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', another studio has been engaged by Electronic Arts to bring the game to the Wii, albeit at a later date than the other console versions, suggesting that it may follow the same model as ''[[Dead Space: Extraction]]'', a Wii title scheduled to be released about a year after ''[[Dead Space (video game)|Dead Space]]'''s first release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://weblogs.variety.com/the_cut_scene/2009/04/brutal-legend-is-coming-to-the-wii-double-fines-not-making-it.html |title=Brutal Legend is coming to the Wii, Double Fine's not making it |first=Ben |last=Fritz |date=April 3, 2009 |access-date=April 3, 2009 |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404105452/http://weblogs.variety.com/the_cut_scene/2009/04/brutal-legend-is-coming-to-the-wii-double-fines-not-making-it.html |archivedate=April 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, further industry rumors, which claimed that the Wii version was being done by Electronic Arts in-house, have stated that the effort to port the game to the Wii has been canceled due to quality and technical concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3175032|title=Rumor: Brutal Legend for Wii Existed, Now Canceled|last=Pigna|first=Kris|date=July 1, 2009|website=|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105204949/http://www.1up.com/news/rumor-brutal-legend-wii-existed|archive-date=2012-11-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially after its release, Double Fine had not planned on a [[Microsoft Windows|PC]] version of the game, as Schafer has stated that the game is primarily an action game and "meant to be on a console".&lt;ref name="eurogamer livechat"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/live-brutal-legend-interview-live-q-and-a | title = Live Brutal Legend interview | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] | date = July 2, 2009 | access-date = July 2, 2009 | first = Robert | last = Purchase}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2013, Double Fine announced that a Windows version of the game will be released on February 26, 2013. The Windows port has been updated for higher resolutions of modern computers, and includes both DLC packs released for consoles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/02/13/brutal-legend-coming-to-pc-multiplayer-beta-live-now/ | title = Brütal Legend coming to PC this month, mültiplayër beta live now | first = Tyler | last = Wilde | date = February 13, 2012 | access-date = February 13, 2013 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The multiplayer aspects of the PC version include a number of tweaks that Double Fine had tracked that they wanted to have made to the console version but could not do; while the full list of changes are not expected to be present in the initial PC release, Schafer has stated that if sales of the PC version are successful, they will look at adding new units, factions, and gameplay modes that they had originally scoped out for the console version.&lt;ref name="rps pc additions"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/02/19/pending-pc-success-brutal-legend-will-go-on/ | title = Pending PC Success, Brutal Legend Will Go On | first = Nathan | last = Grayson | date = February 19, 2013 | access-date = February 19, 2013 | publisher = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mac and Linux ports were released in May 2013, premiering as part of the Humble Double Fine Bundle.

===Sequel===
Double Fine believed they were given the go-ahead to develop a sequel to ''Brütal Legend'' after the game's release, and had invested a great deal of development time towards this, but were later told by EA that it was cancelled.&lt;ref name="shacknews sequel"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/64752 | title = Double Fine Making Four 'Small' Games After Brutal Legend 2 Scrapped | first = Alice | last = O'Conner | date =July 15, 2010 | access-date = July 15, 2010 | publisher = [[Shacknews]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schafer stated that the sequel would likely incorporate much of what they had to drop prior to the game's release. This game world would have been three times larger than what ''Brütal Legend'' contained.&lt;ref name="eurog-interview-2010"/&gt; The sequel would have likely included a fourth faction that was cut from the original game which would have been the last major group the player would have to fight through, including a major boss character, before the final battles with Doviculus.&lt;ref name="rps schafer pc"/&gt; Schafer further noted that at the end of the original game, Doviculus' head falls into the Sea of Black Tears, and implied that the same effect that the Sea had on Ophelia could happen to Doviculus.&lt;ref name="rps schafer pc"/&gt; Schafer also had ideas for a plot using a character voiced by Ronnie James Dio, but will not likely be used due to Dio's death.&lt;ref name="eurog-interview-2010"/&gt;

The cancellation of the sequel nearly ruined Double Fine, as they had invested all current efforts toward the title.&lt;ref name="rps schafer pc"/&gt; Instead of a sequel, Double Fine began work on four smaller projects, ''[[Costume Quest]]'', ''[[Stacking (video game)|Stacking]]'', ''[[Iron Brigade (video game)|Iron Brigade]]'' (formerly titled ''Trenched'') and ''[[Sesame Street: Once Upon a Monster]]'',&lt;ref name="Wired20110405"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2011/04/sesame-street-kinect-game/|title=Sesame Street Game Turns Kinect Into Sensitivity Trainer|last=Schreier|first=Jason|date=April 5, 2011|access-date=August 28, 2013|publisher=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on prototypes they had created from "Amnesia Fortnights" during the development period where they had lacked a publisher. In these two-weeks sessions, the Double Fine team was split into four groups and each tasked with creating a small prototype game to share with the rest of the company; all four mini-games were well received internally. Upon hearing of the cancellation of the sequel, Schafer and his team began to promote these games around, and were able to obtain publishing deals for all four titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/29450/Develop_Double_Fines_Schafer_On_Amnesia_Fortnights_And_The_Pitfalls_Of_AAA.php | title = Develop: Double Fine's Schafer On 'Amnesia Fortnights' And The Pitfalls Of AAA | first = Simon | last = Parkin | date = July 15, 2010 | access-date = July 15, 2010 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The games will be able to take advantage of the custom game world engine and other assets they had created for ''Brütal Legend''.&lt;ref name="shacknews sequel"/&gt; The titles were considered financial successes, allowing Double Fine to recover and pursue further game development though steering away from major AAA releases.&lt;ref name="rps schafer pc"/&gt;

As of 2013, Schafer is still interested in a sequel to ''Brütal Legend'', but would require appropriate funding and resources to make it happen as an independent developer.&lt;ref name="rps pc additions"/&gt; Since then, Double Fine launched a successful crowd-funded drive for ''[[Psychonauts 2]]'' in December 2015; Schafer said that if that game does well, there is a good chance that a sequel to ''Brütal Legend'' would be possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/articles/brutal-legend-sequel-could-happen-if-psychonauts-2/1100-6432874/ | title = Brutal Legend Sequel Could Happen if Psychonauts 2 Does Well | first = Eddie | last = Makuch | date = December 7, 2015 | access-date = December 7, 2015 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brutal Legend will eventually get a sequel, Tim Schafer of developer Double Fine said June 13 during an appearance at E3 2017.

''Brütal Legend'' was originally to be published by [[Vivendi Games]]' subsidiary [[Sierra Entertainment]]. In 2008, [[Activision]] merged with Vivendi's game division (which included [[Blizzard Entertainment]]) to become [[Activision Blizzard]], gaining the rights to publication of ''Brütal Legend''.  Upon evaluation of their assets, Activision Blizzard chose to drop ''Brütal Legend'' along with several other games, leaving the project in limbo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/470753|title=Gaming merger leaves Ghostbusters in limbo|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|first=Marc|last=Saltzman|date=August 2, 2008|access-date=February 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activision CEO [[Robert Kotick]] later claimed the reason for dropping the project was due to: the project running late; missing milestones; overspending the budget and not looking like a good game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-09-27-bobby-kotick-slags-off-tim-schafer | title = Bobby Kotick slags off Tim Schafer | work = [[Eurogamer]] | date = September 27, 2010 | access-date = November 22, 2014 | first = Wesley | last = Yin-Poole }}&lt;/ref&gt; Double Fine themselves were unaware that Activision had chosen to drop the game, having been informed through an Activision press release that omitted the game from their upcoming release schedule, according to studio producer Caroline Esmurdoc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=229781 | title = Activision didn't tell Double Fine it dropped Brutal Legend | work = [[Computer and Video Games]] | date = December 16, 2009 | access-date = December 18, 2009 | first = Ryan | last = King }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry rumors suggested that [[Electronic Arts]] was interested in publishing the property,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=19967|title=EA's DeMartini Plays Coy On Brutal Legend, Ghostbusters| publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|date=August 22, 2008|access-date=February 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was confirmed in December 2008 that Electronic Arts would publish the game.&lt;ref name="eapress"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doublefine.com/news.php/projects/brutallegend|title=Double Fine and EA turn it up to "11" next Fall with the release of Brütal Legend|access-date=December 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period when ''Brütal Legend''{{'}}s fate was unclear, Schafer was not able to talk about the project to avoid causing problems with any potential business deals.&lt;ref name="oxm preview"/&gt;

In February 2009, Activision Blizzard had asserted that the Electronic Arts deal was invalid, believing that they were still in negotiations with Double Fine to publish the game. It was believed that Activision was seeking monetary compensation in a similar manner as it received from [[Atari]] for ''[[Ghostbusters: The Video Game]]'' and ''[[The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena]]'', games that were dropped when Activision Blizzard re-evaluated their assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://weblogs.variety.com/the_cut_scene/2009/02/activision-brutal-legend-is-ours-ea-activision-is-a-jealous-exhusband.html |title=Activision: Brutal Legend is ours.

Activision's considers both the loss of the money they spent on the game as well as potential sales and ''Brütal Legend''-related merchandise as part of the harm done in the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/59034 | title = Activision Sues To Stop Brutal Legend Release | first = Alice | last = O'Conner | date = June 4, 2009 | access-date = June 4, 2009 | publisher = [[Shacknews]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, Double Fine issued a countersuit against Activision, citing that the latter company had abandoned the project before, and was trying to harm ''Brütal Legend'' during its critical marketing phase, as well as trying to protect its ''Guitar Hero'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32089430 | title = Countersuit filed over `Brutal Legend' game | first = Anthony | last = McCartney | date = July 22, 2009 | access-date = July 22, 2009 | agency = Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The countersuit stated that Activision had dropped the game after its merger with Vivendi and a failed attempt to convert the game into a ''Guitar Hero'' sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32089430 | title = Countersuit filed over 'Brutal Legend' video game | first = Anthony | last = McCartney | date = July 22, 2009 | access-date = July 22, 2009 | publisher = Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schafer was infamously quoted as saying, in commenting on their actions, "Hey, if Activision liked it, then they should have put a ring on it. Oh great, now [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyonce]] is going to sue me too."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/01/a-year-in-gaming-quotes-kotick-beatles-tony-hawk.ars | title = A year in gaming quotes: Kotick, Beatles, Tony Hawk | first= Andrew | last = Webster | date = January 7, 2010 | access-date = January 7, 2010 | publisher = Ars Technica }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late July, the presiding judge, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Craig Karlan, reported that a preliminary ruling that could have affected the game's release would have been given on August 6, 2009, with Karlan tentatively ready to deny Activision's motion to delay the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32239683/ns/technology_and_science-games/ | title = Ruling delayed on `Brutal Legend' release | first = Anthony | last = McCartney | date = July 30, 2009 | access-date = July 30, 2009 | agency = Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, prior to the ruling, the companies announced they had reached an out-of-court settlement on the lawsuits, though details were not available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/08/06/arts/AP-US-Games-Brutal-Legend-Lawsuit.html | title = Lawsuit Over 'Brutal Legend' Video Game Settled | date = August 6, 2009 | access-date =August 6, 2009 | agency = Associated Press | work=The New York Times}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/08/actvision-double-fine-brutal-legend-settlement.html | title = Activision and Double Fine settle lawsuit over Brutal Legend game | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = August 6, 2009 | access-date = August 7, 2009 | first = Alex | last = Pham |author2=Fritz, Ben }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though most of the developers involved in the game were shielded from the effects of the lawsuit, Double Fine's Caroline Esmurdoc noted that it took a significant toll on Schafer and the other lead executives at the company.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; Activision's lawsuit had been filed at the time the game had reached the [[Software release life cycle#Alpha|alpha]] release state, and would need to be concluded prior to the game's final release; this required the executives to dedicate their time towards information gathering, interviewing, and other legal matters "during the crunchiest, most critical time of development".&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; As such, while they ultimately were able to settle the legal matter, Esmurdoc believed that the impact of the effort in settling the lawsuit impacted the quality of the final product.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; Schafer wrote more than 50% of the game's dialog in the few months following the completion of the lawsuit and prior to release, a "big crunch" for him.&lt;ref name="eurog-interview-2010"/&gt;

===Downloadable content===
Schafer, prior to the game's release, stated that Double Fine had "something awesome" planned for [[downloadable content]] to further support the game after release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.vg247.com/2009/05/05/brutal-legend-dlc-is-something-awesome-says-schafer/ | title = Brutal Legend DLC is "something awesome," says Schafer | first = Patrick | last = Garrett | date = May 5, 2009 | access-date = May 5, 2009 | publisher = [[VG247]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two downloadable packs have since been released. The first, "Tears of the Hextadon", was released in early November 2009, containing two new multiplayer maps and a new single-player weapon. The pack was initially free on the PlayStation Network for the first two weeks of release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.ea.com/news/ea-release-first-dlc-for-brutal-legend | title = Double Fine and EA Get Rocking with First Downloadable Content for Brütal Legend | publisher = [[Electronic Arts]] | date = October 27, 2009 | access-date = November 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second pack, "The Hammer of Infinite Fate", was released in mid-December 2009, and in addition to new multiplayer maps, expands the single-player experience by incorporating new weaponry for the Deuce, outfits for Eddie, a [[GPS]] system to track collectibles in the game's world, and other additional content, including figureheads of Razputin, the lead character from ''Psychonauts'', and Schafer himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/61532 | title = Brutal Legend 'Hammer of Infinite Fate' DLC Announced, Brings Giant Stone Schafer and Razputin | first = Alice | last = O'Conner | date = December 8, 2009 | access-date = December 18, 2009 | publisher = [[Shacknews]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Brütal Legend'' was officially announced in October 2007 through a feature article in ''[[Game Informer]]'';&lt;ref name="gi reveal"/&gt; gaming journalists had received a [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]] from Activision that contained a [[Backmasking|backwards message]] alluding to the game's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3163634 | title = Schafer's Brutal Legend Finally Confirmed | first = Kris | last = Pagna | date = October 12, 2007 | access-date = January 13, 2010 | publisher = [[1UP.com]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090325062109/http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3163634 | archivedate = March 25, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's release in October 2009 was promoted as "Rocktober" in official literature about the game from Electronic Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/694910/Brutal-Legend-Releasing-This-Rocktober-October.html| title = 'Brutal Legend' Releasing This "Rocktober" (October) | publisher = [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4 TV]] | date = April 21, 2009 | access-date = June 16, 2009 | first = Brian | last = Leahy }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2009 [[Download Festival]] in [[Donington Park]] in [[England]], [[Electronic Arts]] arranged for 440 fans of ''Brütal Legend'' to help to break the [[Guinness World Record]] for the largest number of [[air guitar]] players, all simultaneously playing to "[[Ace of Spades (song)|Ace of Spades]]" by [[Motörhead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/92411-Br-tal-Legend-Fans-Set-New-Air-Guitar-World-Record | title = Brütal Legend Fans Set New Air Guitar World Record | first = Andy | last = Chalk | date = June 15, 2009 |access-date= June 15, 2009 | publisher = The Escapist}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of short online videos featuring Black (and Schafer in two instances), entitled "Brutal Thoughts with Jack Black", have been used to promote the game since May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/58730 | title = Brutal (Legend) Thoughts with Jack Black: Episode 1 | publisher = [[Shacknews]] | first = Chris | last = Faylor | date = May 21, 2009 | access-date = August 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2009 [[Video Music Awards]], Black appeared in [[cosplay]] as Eddie to promote the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2009/09/14/vmas-feature-jack-black-dressed-as-eddie-riggs-of-brutal-legend/ | title = VMAs Feature Jack Black Dressed As Eddie Riggs Of 'Brutal Legend' | first = Russ | last = Frushtick | date = September 14, 2009 | access-date = September 14, 2009 | publisher = MTV }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
''Brütal Legend'' features 107 heavy metal tracks from 75 different bands, selected by Schafer and Music Director Emily Ridgway as listed below,&lt;ref name="tracklist"&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/news/brutal-legends-full-soundtrack-listing-makes-heads-explode/ | title = GameDaily is the first to bring you the game's full setlist. These 100+ songs will make your head explode! | first = Libe | last = Goad | date = August 9, 2009 | access-date = August 9, 2009 | publisher = [[Game Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; each song being a "completely sincere choice" by Schafer and Ridgway,&lt;ref name="1up scheffer profile"/&gt; with the whole track list being "designed to be loved by Metal fans."&lt;ref name="tracklist"/&gt; Schafer sought to include songs from most main subgenres of metal, including classic [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[industrial metal]], [[black metal]], and [[doom metal]], with each faction in the game favoring a specific type.&lt;ref name="eurogamer livechat"/&gt; Though Schafer and others on the Double Fine team had vast knowledge of specific types of metal, Ridgway turned to a used-CD store owner named Allan from [[Aquarius Records (store)|Aquarius Records]] who had "encyclopedic knowledge" of the entire genre, and who provided the team with sample CDs to help them discover some of the more obscure metal bands.&lt;ref name="gi interview"/&gt; Schafer had identified many of the more well-known songs on the list, while Ridgway was able to locate mission-appropriate, more obscure titles for inclusion; for example, one mission, given by the Killmaster (voiced by [[Lemmy Kilmister]]), involves rescuing female troops for Ironheade's army; Ridgway had been able to locate a cover of "[[Bomber (song)|Bomber]]", originally recorded by [[Motörhead]] (Kilmister's band) and performed by the all-female metal band [[Girlschool]], recorded in their 1981 split EP ''[[St. Valentine's Day Massacre (EP)|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]]''.&lt;ref name="rps schafer pc"/&gt; Schafer also credits Black with some of the music selections for the game.&lt;ref name="gi interview"/&gt; Instead of relying on labels or bands to provide them with a list of possible songs to select from, the development team sought permission to use specific songs they wanted in the game. In some cases, obtaining appropriate licensing proved difficult, as for songs from bands that had long split up, Double Fine needed to contact each band member to gain permission. This proved to be valuable, as some original bands were excited about their music being used in the game; in one case, Lita Ford was able to provide the game with a song with slight modifications to the lyrics from a version that she was about to release.&lt;ref name="shacknews schaffer pax"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=1191 |title=Brutal Legend Interview: Tim Schafer Talks Metal, Rubik's Cubes, Psychonauts, Sequels and More |first=Chris |last=Faylor |date=September 7, 2009 |access-date=September 8, 2009 |publisher=[[Shacknews]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909180310/http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=1191 |archivedate=September 9, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One song is from the in-game band "Kabbage Boy" for which Eddie is a roadie at the start of the game.&lt;ref name="kotaku kabbage boy"/&gt;

Schafer had tried to get music from groups like [[Metallica]] and [[AC/DC]], but their licensing fees were too high.&lt;ref name="rps schafer pc"/&gt; He further tried to work with [[Iron Maiden]], but the group was hesitant to participate after recognizing that the character name "Eddie Riggs" suggested an attachment with the band's mascot, named "[[Eddie the Head|Eddie]]" and designed by [[Derek Riggs]]; the band's marketing group pointed out that this could imply that Iron Maiden had endorsed the game.&lt;ref name="rps schafer pc"/&gt;

In addition to licensed music, the game includes over 70 minutes of original score by Tim Schafer's long term collaborator [[Peter McConnell]].&lt;ref name="soundtrack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petermc.com/Subpages/Credits.html |title=Composition credits for Peter McConnell: TBA (Double Fine/Vivendi 2007) i.e., Brutal Legend |access-date=October 23, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024163700/http://www.petermc.com/Subpages/Credits.html |archivedate=October 24, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; McConnell composed pieces for orchestra and Metal band to tie in with the licensed music in the game.&lt;ref name="gi interview"/&gt; Also, the in-game soundtrack contains an instrumental drum track played by [[Slough Feg]] drummer Harry Cantwell, all other "real" drums (6 tracks) were played by [[Y&amp;T]] drummer Mike Vanderhule and recorded by [[Jory Prum]].&lt;ref name=gangpetermcinterview /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mikevanderhule.com&lt;/ref&gt; The solos triggered by the player during the game were composed and recorded by [[Judas Priest]] guitarists [[Glenn Tipton]] (Eddie's solos) and [[K.K. Downing]] (Ophelia's and Doviculus' solos).&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; While Schafer would like to have a soundtrack album for the game, he stated that there were already difficulties in securing the licenses for songs within the game and was not sure if it would be possible to extend them to a soundtrack.&lt;ref name="eurogamer livechat"/&gt; Schafer helped to select three songs—"We Are The Road Crew" by Motörhead, "The Metal" by Tenacious D, and "More Than Meets The Eye" by Testament—to appear in a pack of ''[[Rock Band]]'' [[downloadable content|downloadable songs]] that was made available the same day as ''Brütal Legend'''s release.&lt;ref name="latestDLC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockband.com/forums/showthread.php?p=3133284#post3133284|title=DLC Week of 10/13|publisher=[[Harmonix]]|date=October 9, 2009|access-date=October 9, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012074214/http://www.rockband.com/forums/showthread.php?p=3133284#post3133284#post3133284|archive-date=October 12, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Brütal Legend'' received positive response from gaming journalists, with reviewers praising the story and characters of the game, and driven vocal performances of the voice actors, particularly Black and Osbourne. Daemon Hatfield of [[IGN]] felt Black was "completely committed" to the role of Riggs,&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt; while [[Giant Bomb]]'s Ryan Davis found it relieving that Black reined in his typical "loud-talking heavy-metal goofball" act that he is known for and instead performed well, "bringing just the right amount of working-man's matter-of-fact-ness to the role".&lt;ref name="giantbomb review"/&gt; Osbourne's role was considered "amazing (and surprisingly coherent)" by [[GameSpot]]'s Giancarlo Varanini and "played brilliantly" by [[Computer and Video Games]]' Andrew Kelly.&lt;ref name="cvg review"/&gt; The full cast was commended for their roles; the heavy metal musicians were effective at playing themselves in the game, while the other voice talent performed well and "[did] their part to balance out the star power" in the game.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt; The strength of the characters was considered to be enhanced by the quality of writing of the story, and the use of facial animation.&lt;ref name="cvg review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespy review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt; [[Eurogamer]]'s Christian Donlan considered the characters of ''Brütal Legend'' to be the strongest aspect to the game, distancing the title from other video games due to "rounded, personable leads who are distinctly superior to the usual throngs of cybermen and super-vixens", and a facet of Schafer's signature work.&lt;ref name="eurog review"/&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'''s Chris Kohler further attested the strength of the game's story to Schafer's skill, considering that "After ''Brütal Legend'', he should be considered one of the best storytellers in gaming, period."&lt;ref name="wired review"&gt;{{Cite web| url = https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2009/10/brutal-legend-review/ | title = Review: Brütal Legend Rocks the Story, Whiffs the Gameplay | first = Chris | last = Kohler | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date = October 13, 2009 | access-date = October 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1UP.com]]'s Justin Haywald noted that the game lacks the ability to review cutscenes, forcing the player to restart the story if they wanted to see these again.&lt;ref name="1up review"/&gt;

The heavy metal-inspired world of ''Brütal Legend'' was also well received, and considered to show a clear reverence for the genre.  Gerald Villoria of [[GameSpy]] considered the game to be "dedicated to an unabashed love of metal" and "heavy metal fan-service to the highest degree".&lt;ref name="gamespy review"/&gt; Davis believed that the juxtaposition of all the elements that made up the heavy metal fantasy world were the game's greatest strength, often being "both giddily ridiculous and fist-pumpingly badass" at the same time.&lt;ref name="giantbomb review"/&gt; Critics found that while the graphics for the game may not be the most sophisticated for the current console generation, the detailed art aspects of the world were impressive; Varanini considered that "no matter where you are in the world, there's always some cool object to look at",&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt; while Donlan considered the world to be a "constant unfolding delight".&lt;ref name="eurog review"/&gt; The incorporation of heavy metal music into the game also benefited the game. Both Kelly and Villoria considered the soundtrack essential to the game, and praised the moments where specific songs, such as Dragonforce's "Through the Fire and Flames" would be used as background music during specific game sequences.&lt;ref name="cvg review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespy review"/&gt; Kelly further praised the game for using the songs to define the action of the game instead of relegated to random background music.&lt;ref name="cvg review"/&gt; Villoria also considered the soundtrack to have "enormous breadth of sound and diversity", introducing the player to heavy metal genres they may not have known even existed.&lt;ref name="gamespy review"/&gt; [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]]'s Jake Gaskill considered listening to the soundtrack to be the equivalent of "taking a class in heavy metal appreciation."&lt;ref name="xplay review"/&gt;

The actual gameplay was seen as ''Brütal Legend''{{'s}} largest weakness. Many reviewers were critical of the incorporation of real-time strategy (RTS) elements into the game, a fact that was not well advertised prior to the game's release and does not become apparent to the player in the first hours of the game.&lt;ref name="eurog review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired review"/&gt; Though Schafer had set out to make the console-based game like an RTS from the start,&lt;ref name="strategy faq"/&gt; they were warned by both Vivendi and Electronic Arts that "RTS" was "a naughty word in the console space", and instead marketed it as an action game.&lt;ref name="postmortem"/&gt; Despite this, reviewers found that the game was still difficult to play on a console due to the selected controls that made it difficult to target objectives or troops, the lack of a mini-map to track friends and foes, and the frantic pace of battle.&lt;ref name="1up review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespy review"/&gt;

Critics did appreciate the slow introduction to the various aspects of the game as part of the single player game, but felt the game did not adequately introduce or explain all of the game's RTS features, such as the ability to mount a final stand on one's stage.&lt;ref name="giantbomb review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wired review"/&gt; Some also considered the single-player campaign Stage Battles to be too easy, winnable by brute force,&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt; and that more advanced tactics would only become apparent as one played in multiplayer games, including learning the abilities and advantages of the other units of the factions other than Ironheade.&lt;ref name="eurog review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt; The mix of gaming genres between the RTS and third-person action was found particularly confusing; Kohler commented that the handling of the individual genres was accomplished well, leading to "an astoundingly complex design instead of a simple one" that diminished the enjoyment of the game,&lt;ref name="wired review"/&gt; while Davis considered that "perhaps there wasn't enough confidence in any one piece to let it carry the whole game".&lt;ref name="giantbomb review"/&gt; However, some felt that the various genres helped to create "a variety of gameplay opportunities",&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt; and made for "rather elegant" Stage Battles.&lt;ref name="eurog review"/&gt; In retrospect, Schafer lamented that they did not include enough tutorials in the game to guide the player as to "naturally how to play the strategy part a bit better", as they had come to accept over the years of development, and tried to use the Double Fine blog to explain some of these aspects.&lt;ref name="eurog-interview-2010"/&gt; Though some critics argued that stripping out the RTS elements and leaving an action combat game wrapped in the metal-themed world would have been a better game, Schafer countered that this would have not been true to the vision that he had from the start.&lt;ref name="rps schafer pc"/&gt; Schafer would later jokingly refer to the RTS elements of ''Brütal Legend''; during the fundraising for ''[[Broken Age]]'', Schafer teasingly threatened to add RTS elements to the point-and-click if the funding had reached certain levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-02-15-the-kickstarter-conundrum | title = The Kickstarter Conundrum | first = Dan | last = Whitehead | date = February 15, 2012 | access-date = February 15, 2012 | publisher = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gameplay outside of the Stage Battles was also met with mixed impressions. Most considered the side missions highly repetitive,&lt;ref name="cvg review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespy review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="xplay review"/&gt; which included mission types that are generally disliked by gamers, such as [[Quest (gaming)#Escort quests|escort missions]].&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespy review"/&gt;  The lack of a mini-map, replaced by either following a glowing light from the sky illuminating the player's target or by navigating based on the Deuce's turn signals, was criticized for making it difficult to explore the game's world.&lt;ref name="1up review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespy review"/&gt; The information about the world that players can access in the game's pause menu was also found to be lacking, neither showing the collectible elements of the game on the main map, nor easily identifying the alliance of the various troops in the in-game guidebook.&lt;ref name="1up review"/&gt;  Though Eddie gains the ability to fly during Stage Battles, the inability to use this or to make the character jump led to reviewers getting the character stuck on the landscape at times when exploring.&lt;ref name="1up review"/&gt; Some reviewers found the number of progress checkpoints in the game to be lacking, requiring the player to repeat a long mission if they should die before reaching one.&lt;ref name="cvg review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gamespy review"/&gt; The single-player game was also considered to be short, lasting as little as four hours if one only completed the main story missions.&lt;ref name="eurog review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="giantbomb review"/&gt;
===Sales===
According to the [[NPD Group]], ''Brütal Legend'' sold approximately 215,000 copies in the United States in October 2009, with about 150,000 copies being for the Xbox 360 platform, making it the 12th-top-selling game in that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/news/6239988.html | title = Brutal Legend sells 216K, DJ Hero 123K | first = Tor | last = Thompson | date = November 12, 2009 | access-date = November 19, 2009 | publisher = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=26079 | title = NPD: October Top 20 Sees Impressive Demon's Souls Showing | date = November 13, 2009 | access-date= November 19, 2009 | first = Matt | last = Mathews | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers were not considered to be strong, and were attributed to the difficult marketing of the game, which emphasized Jack Black's involvement and the heavy metal nature of the game, but did not assert what the gameplay would actually be like, with the possibility that the mention of the RTS elements of the game would have possibly driven more players away from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/700714/Brutal-Legend-And-DJ-Hero-Fail-To-Crack-Top-Ten-In-Sales.html | title = Brutal Legend And DJ Hero Fail To Crack Top Ten In Sales | first = Stephan | last = Johnson | date = November 13, 2009 | access-date = November 19, 2009 | publisher = [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4TV]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in February 2011, Schafer claimed that the game had sold over 1.4 million copies.&lt;ref name="gamasutra stacking interview"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6284/schafer_admits_fantasy_of_.php | title = Schafer Admits Fantasy Of Flatulence On Youth | first = Christian | last = Nutt | date = February 11, 2011 | access-date = February 11, 2011 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to data collected through [[Nielsen SoundScan]], some songs contained within ''Brütal Legend'''s soundtrack saw digital sales increases of up to 700% following the game's release, similar to the effects of ''Guitar Hero'' and ''Rock Band'', though impact on overall sales of these songs was rather small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2009/12/18/technology/tech-us-2009-games.html | title = Sales Of Music Video Games Plummet In 2009 | publisher = Reuters | date =December 18, 2009 |access-date = December 20, 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cadw''' ({{IPA-cy|ˈkadu|}}, a [[Welsh language|Welsh]] [[verbal noun]] meaning "keeping/preserving") is the historic environment service of the [[Welsh Government]] and part of the Tourism and Culture group. Cadw works to protect the historic buildings and structures, the landscapes and heritage sites of Wales, so that the public can visit them, enjoy them and understand their significance. Cadw manages 127 state owned properties and sites. It arranges events at its managed properties, provides lectures and teaching sessions, offers heritage walks and hosts an online shop. Members of the public can become members of Cadw to gain membership privileges.

==Aims and objectives==
[[File:Dolwyddelan Castle Cadw.jpg|thumb|239px|[[Dolwyddelan Castle]], one of the sites in Cadw's care.]]
As the Welsh Government's historic environment service, Cadw is charged with protecting the historic environment of Wales, and making it accessible to members of the public. To this end, in 2010–11 it identified four aspects of its work; it would take measures to conserve the heritage of Wales, its ancient buildings and monuments; it aimed to sustain the distinctive characters of the different landscapes and urban areas; it would try to help people understand and care about their country, their locality and its history, and the place of Wales in the world; it aimed to improve the wellbeing of people in Wales.&lt;ref name=report2012&gt;[http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/docs/cadw/publications/The%20Welsh%20Historic%20Environment%20Position%20Statement%202010-11_EN.pdf Cadw Historic Environment Position Satatement 2010–11]. Retrieved 1 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation and protection=== 
Cadw is responsible for the care and upkeep of three [[World Heritage Site]]s in Wales: the [[Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd]], the [[Pontcysyllte Aqueduct]] and the [[Blaenavon Industrial Landscape]].

Many of these listed sites are in private ownership, but Cadw has a specific responsibility for the care and upkeep of the 127 historic sites that are in state ownership. Many of Wales' great [[castle]]s and other monuments, such as bishop's palaces, historic houses, and ruined [[abbey]]s, are protected and maintained in this way, as well being opened to the public. Cadw has been appointed by the [[Welsh Government]] and is the successor body in Wales to the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]].&lt;ref name=Introduction&gt;[http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/docs/cadw/publications/IntroducingCadw_EN.pdf Introducing Cadw], Cadw. Retrieved 31 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Cadw also identifies (and develops to criteria for identification) of historical assets in Wales. In 2011 there were 29,936 [[listed building]]s in Wales ; of these, 493 were the most important Grade I listed buildings, 2,124 were Grade II* and 27,319 were Grade II listed. Most of these were in private ownership. Also in Wales were 4,175 [[Scheduled Monuments in Wales|Scheduled Monuments]], 6 [[List of designations under the Protection of Wrecks Act|Designated historic wrecks]], and 523 [[Conservation Area (United Kingdom)|Conservation Areas]]; these designations means that the buildings or objects concerned are protected by statute. A register of significant Welsh battlefield sites is also under preparation.&lt;ref name=report2012/&gt;

===Area character studies===

There are 58 [[Historic landscape characterisation|Historic Landscapes]] and 376 [[Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales|Historic parks and gardens]] in Wales. Cadw is also undertaking urban character studies of urban areas. Eight had been completed by September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/historicenvironment/regenerationandsustainability/understandingcharacter/?lang=en Understanding Character], Cadw. Retrieved 31 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with a register of buildings and ancient monuments at risk these aim to enable management decision making and grant allocation to strengthen the character of different areas.&lt;ref name=report2012/&gt;

===Care and operation===

[[File:Pentre Ifan -neolithic dolmen -Wales-1June2009.jpg|thumb|239px|[[Pentre Ifan]], a Neolithic dolmen in Pembrokeshire]]

Cadw operates most of the heritage sites in its care and opens them to the public. In 2010–11 there were an estimated 2 million visits to Cadw properties. In some cases, these are major tourist attractions and offer tours of the monuments, exhibitions and display panels. Cadw also produces books and guidebooks on many of their properties. However many of the sites are unstaffed, free to access, and have interpretation boards to explain their significance.&lt;ref name=Introduction/&gt; Alongside this, a mobile app was released in 2016, which provides basic information for visitors as well as an interpretative aspect for larger sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.11141/ia.44.15 | issue=44 | title=Review of Cadw Mobile App [application] | year=2017 | journal=Internet Archaeology | last1 = Rothenberg | first1 = Miriam }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five most frequently visited properties in 2010-11 were [[Caernarfon Castle]] (192,695 visits), [[Conwy Castle]] (190,031 visits), [[Caerphilly Castle]] (94,707 visits), [[Harlech Castle]] (93,242 visits) and [[Beaumaris Castle]] (80,660 visits).&lt;ref name=report2012/&gt;

To provide a better context for the history of Wales, in 2010–11 Cadw was developing thematic 'All Wales Interpretation Plans', that could develop themes across numerous sites and localities. There were eight themes:-
* Origins and prehistory.
* Roman invasion and settlement.
* Celtic saints and pilgrimage.
* Churches, chapels and monastic landscapes.
* Castles and Princes of Medieval Wales.
* Artistic responses to the landscape.
* The Defence of the Realm — Pembrokeshire.
* Wales — the first industrial nation.&lt;ref name=report2012/&gt;

==Membership==
Cadw Membership, formerly known as Heritage in Wales, gives the member free admission to all Cadw properties and World Heritage Sites in Wales for the length of their membership (annual or life). Other membership advantages are a free magazine, reduced prices at the online gift shop and free entry to most Cadw-organised events. Cadw has also entered into reciprocal agreements with [[English Heritage]], [[Historic Scotland]] and [[Manx National Heritage]] for free entry to the properties they manage.&lt;ref name=Official&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cadw.gov.wales/about/?skip=1&amp;lang=en |title=Cadw: About Cadw |publisher=Cadw |accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
Cadw organises events for adults and families. These include lectures, re-enactments of historical events, and training sessions for teachers, informing them on how to use visits to historic sites to help deliver literacy and numeracy skills and an appreciation of history.&lt;ref name=Events/&gt;

Historical and cultural events are one of the ways people are encouraged to engage more thoroughly with the places and history of Cadw properties, and some 200 events a year are held.&lt;ref name=Events&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/events/?lang=en |title=Cadw: Events |publisher=Cadw |accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cadw also provides work experience opportunities for young people, and sandwich courses for undergraduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cadw.gov.wales/learning/?lang=en |title=Cadw: Learning |publisher=Cadw |accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2749">The "'''California effect'''" is the shift of consumer, environmental and other regulations in the direction of political jurisdictions with stricter regulatory standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vogel|first1=David|title=Trading Up: Consumer and Environmental regulation in a global economy|date=1995|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674900837}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is derived from the spread of some advanced environmental regulatory standards that were originally adopted by the U.S. state of [[California]] and eventually adopted in other states. This spread is supported by large corporations, which stand to gain as they have the resources necessary to deal with the regulations, unlike their smaller competitors. This process is the opposite of the [[Delaware]] effect; this is simply the [[race to the bottom]] in which different countries (or states in the case of Delaware) are simply reducing their regulatory burden to  attract more of the businesses into their jurisdiction. The assumption behind the Delaware effect is that in the competitive regulatory environment, governments have to remove their regulatory barriers to allow easier functioning of their corporations and to attract new companies to establish their business.

While additional regulation can prove to be a burden for any corporation, higher regulatory standards can be a solution to certain externalities which are decreasing the total public good.

This term is mostly associated with [[David Vogel (professor)|David Vogel]] who called this phenomenon the "California effect".&lt;ref&gt;A Haas Book Review, Trading Up: Consumer and Environmental Regulation in a Global Economy, http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/pubs/books/vogel/Trading_Up.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual existence of this effect in the real world is disputed. While there is large discussion on the possible race to the bottom among countries competing for attention of internationally mobile capital, there seems to be some limited evidence that at least in some sectors the California effect can be observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perkins|first1=Richard|last2=Neumayer|first2=Eric|title=Does the ‘California effect’ operate across borders?

The '''culture of New England''' comprises a shared heritage and culture primarily shaped by its indigenous peoples, early English colonists, and waves of immigration from Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;McWilliams, John P. ''New Endland's Crises and Cultural Memory''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004. Available at: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zesIMXUecgkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22new+england%22+cultural+identity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qG6HSBrch2&amp;sig=yOp5yIF4oCPkWnhHM1O6d3u-q9s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WsBHTIjGJMT38AbLlMn8BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwATge#v=onepage&amp;q=%22new%20england%22%20cultural%20identity&amp;f=false]. Retrieved 2010-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to other American regions, many of New England's earliest Puritan settlers came from eastern England, contributing to New England's distinctive accents, foods, customs, and social structures.

New England is the oldest region of the United States and one of the first successful English settlements in the Americas, and it has a long and oft-contested cultural history. Professor of American and New England Studies Joseph A. Conforti writes, "New England has been a storied place. Its identity has been encoded in narratives about its past—stories that have been continually revised in response to new interpretive needs generated by the transformations of regional life[, helping] New Englanders negotiate, traditionalize, and resist change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conforti|first1=Joseph A.|title=Imagining New England: Explorations of Regional Identity from the Pilgrims to the Mid-Twentieth Century|date=2001|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UzyR6xZQXYAC&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=%22new%20england%20culture%22&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, New England culture is a complex combination of its overarching and popular Puritan English colonial narrative and its multiple and equally important complementary and competing alternative narratives.

Within modern New England, a cultural divide also exists between urban, mobile New Englanders living along the densely populated coastline, and in much of Connecticut, and rural New Englanders in western Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, where population density is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/Earthlab/lulchistory/nepopulationgrowth.htm|title=New England Population History|accessdate=2008-08-26|publisher=Brown University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[creative economy]] also plays an important role in the larger [[economy of New England]]. In 2002, there were nearly 275,000 workers in the region engaged in cultural enterprises, with nearly half in Massachusetts alone.&lt;ref name="nefa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Various|title=The Creative Economy: A New Definition|url=http://www.nefa.org/sites/default/files/ResearchCreativeEconReport2007.pdf|website=New England Foundation for the Arts|publisher=nefa.org|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a percentage of the workforce compared to other US states, Massachusetts ranks first for architects, Connecticut ranks third for producers and directors, Maine ranks fourth for visual artists, New Hampshire ranks eleventh for writers, Rhode Island ranks first for photographers, and Vermont ranks third for visual artists, announcers, and writers.&lt;ref name="nefa" /&gt;

Historian Samuel Eliot Morison uses the metaphor of wine to describe the relationship between present New England culture and its past:

{{Bq
  |text=The wine of New England is not a series of successive vintages, each distinct from the other, like the wines of France; it is more like the mother-wine in those great casks of port and sherry that one sees in the ''bodegas'' of Portugal and Spain, from which  a certain amount is drawn off every year, and replaced by an equal volume of the new. Thus the change is gradual and the mother wine of 1656 still gives bouquet and flavor to what is drawn in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morison|first1=Samuel Eliot|title=The Founding of Harvard College|date=1935|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Many of the first European colonists of New England had a [[Sea|maritime]] orientation toward [[whaling]] (first noted about 1650)&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and fishing, in addition to farming. New England has developed a distinct [[New England cuisine|cuisine]], [[Eastern New England English|dialect]], [[Connected farm|architecture]], and government. New England cuisine has a reputation for its emphasis on seafood and dairy; [[clam chowder]], lobster, and other products of the sea are among some of the region's most popular foods.

==Religion==

Today, New England is the least religious part of the U.S. In 2009, less than half of those polled in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont claimed that religion was an important part of their daily lives. Southernmost New England in Connecticut is among the ten least religious states, 53 percent, of those polled claimed that it was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/114022/state-states-importance-religion.aspx|title=State of the States: Importance of Religion|accessdate=2010-02-09|publisher=Gallup}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Religious Identification Survey]], 34 percent of Vermonters, a plurality, claimed to have no religion; on average, nearly one out of every four New Englanders identifies as having no religion, more than in any other part of the U.S.&lt;ref name="ARIS2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://b27.cc.trincoll.edu/weblogs/AmericanReligionSurvey-ARIS/reports/part3c_geog.html|title=ARIS 2008 Report: Part IIIC – Geography|author=American Religious Identification Survey|accessdate=2011-04-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304012329/http://b27.cc.trincoll.edu/weblogs/AmericanReligionSurvey-ARIS/reports/part3c_geog.html|archivedate=2011-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New England has one of the highest percentages of Catholics in the U.S. This number declined from 50% in 1990 to 36% in 2008.&lt;ref name="ARIS2008"/&gt;

The literature of New England has had an enduring influence on [[American literature]] in general, with themes such as religion, race, the individual versus society, social repression, and nature, emblematic of the larger concerns of American letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/books/literary_guide/2006/06/29/new_england/|title=New England|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New England has been the birthplace of American authors and poets. [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] was born in Boston. [[Henry David Thoreau]] was born in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], where he famously lived, for some time, by [[Walden Pond]], on Emerson's land. [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[romantic era]] writer, was born in historical [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]]; later, he would live in Concord at the same time as Emerson and Thoreau. All three of these writers have strong connections to [[The Old Manse]], a home in the Emerson family and a key center of the [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist movement]]. [[Emily Dickinson]] lived most of her life in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]]. [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] was from Portland, Maine, and [[Edgar Allan Poe]] was born in Boston.

According to reports, the famed [[Mother Goose]], the author of fairy tales and nursery rhymes was originally a person named Elizabeth Foster Goose or Mary Goose who lived in Boston. Poets [[James Russell Lowell]], [[Amy Lowell]], and [[Robert Lowell]], a [[Confessionalism (poetry)|Confessionalist]] poet and teacher of [[Sylvia Plath]], were all New England natives. [[Anne Sexton]], also taught by Lowell, was born and died in Massachusetts. Much of the work of Nobel Prize laureate [[Eugene O'Neill]] is associated with the city of [[New London, Connecticut]] where he spent many summers. The 14th U.S. [[Poet Laureate]] [[Donald Hall]], a New Hampshire resident, continues the line of renowned New England poets. [[Noah Webster]], the Father of American Scholarship and Education, was born in [[West Hartford, Connecticut]]. [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry|Pulitzer Prize winning]] poets [[Edwin Arlington Robinson]], [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and [[Robert P. T. Coffin]] were born in [[Maine]].

Poets [[Stanley Kunitz]] and [[Elizabeth Bishop]] were both born in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], and Pulitzer Prize–winning poet [[Galway Kinnell]] was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. [[Oliver La Farge]], a New Englander of French and Narragansett descent, won the [[Pulitzer Prize for the Novel]], the predecessor to the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]], in 1930 for his book [[Laughing Boy (novel)|Laughing Boy]]. [[John P. Marquand]] grew up in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]]. Novelist [[Edwin O'Connor]], who was also known as a radio personality and journalist, won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] for his novel [[The Edge of Sadness]]. Pulitzer Prize winner [[John Cheever]], a novelist and short story writer, was born in [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] and set most of his fiction in old New England villages based on various South Shore towns around there. [[E. Annie Proulx]] was born in [[Norwich, Connecticut]]. [[David Lindsay-Abaire]], who won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] in 2007 for his play [[Rabbit Hole]], was raised in Boston.

''[[Ethan Frome]]'', written in 1911 by [[Edith Wharton]], is set in turn-of-the-century New England, in the fictitious town of Starkfield, Massachusetts. Like much literature of the region, it plays off themes of isolation and hopelessness. New England is also the setting for most of the [[gothic novel|gothic]] horror stories of [[H. P. Lovecraft]], who lived his life in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. Real New England towns such as [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]], [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]], [[Rowley, Massachusetts|Rowley]], and [[Marblehead, Massachusetts|Marblehead]] featured often in his stories alongside fictional locations such as Dunwich, Arkham, Innsmouth and Kingsport. Lovecraft often expressed an appreciation for New England in his personal correspondence, and believed that returning to the area was the reason that his writing improved after he left New York City.

[[Jack Kerouac]], pioneer of the [[Beat Generation]] and author of the 1957 novel [[On the Road]] was born in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] in 1922 and was later also buried there after his death in 1969.

[[File:Moby Dick p510 illustration.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'']]
The region has also drawn authors and poets from other parts of the U.S. [[Mark Twain]] thought Hartford was the most beautiful city in the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} He made it his home, and wrote his masterpieces there. He lived next door to [[Harriett Beecher Stowe]], a local most famous for the novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. [[John Updike]], originally from [[Pennsylvania]], eventually moved to [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]], which served as the model for the fictional New England town of [[Tarbox]] in his 1968 novel ''Couples''. [[Robert Frost]] was born in California, but moved to Massachusetts during his teen years and published his first poem in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]]; his frequent use of New England settings and themes ensured that he would be associated with the region. [[Arthur Miller]], a New York City native, used New England as the setting for some of his works, most notably ''[[The Crucible]]''.

[[Herman Melville]], originally from New York City, bought the house now known as [[Arrowhead (Herman Melville)|Arrowhead]] in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]], and there wrote his greatest novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]''. Poet [[Maxine Kumin]] was born in [[Philadelphia]], and currently resides in [[Warner, New Hampshire]]. Pulitzer Prize–winning poet [[Mary Oliver]] was born in [[Maple Heights, Ohio]], and has lived in [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]] for the last forty years. [[Charles Simic]], who was born in [[Belgrade]], Serbia (at that time [[Yugoslavia]]) grew up in Chicago and lives in [[Strafford, New Hampshire]], on the shore of [[Bow Lake (New Hampshire)|Bow Lake]]. He is the [[professor emeritus]] of [[American literature]] and [[creative writing]] at the [[University of New Hampshire]]. Pulitzer Prize–winning novelist and short story writer [[Steven Millhauser]], whose short story "Eisenheim the Illusionist" was adapted into the 2006 film ''[[The Illusionist (2006 film)|The Illusionist]]'', was born in New York City and raised in Connecticut.

More recently, [[Stephen King]], born in [[Portland, Maine]], has used the small towns of his home state as the setting for much of his horror fiction, with several of his stories taking place in or near the fictional town of Castle Rock. Just to the south, [[Exeter, New Hampshire]] was the birthplace of best-selling novelist [[John Irving]] and [[Dan Brown]], author of ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''. [[Rick Moody]] has set many of his works in southern New England, focusing on wealthy families of suburban Connecticut's [[Gold Coast, Connecticut|Gold Coast]] and their battles with addiction and [[anomie]].

[[Derek Walcott]], a playwright and poet who won the 1992 [[Nobel Prize for Literature]], taught poetry at [[Boston University]]. Pulitzer Prize winner [[Cormac McCarthy]], whose novel ''[[No Country for Old Men]]'' was made into the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] winning film in [[No Country for Old Men (film)|2007]], was born in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], although he moved to Tennessee when he was a boy. [[The New York Times Best Seller list|New York Times Bestselling author]] [[Dennis Lehane]], another native of the Boston area, who was born in [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]], wrote the novels that were adapted into the films ''[[Mystic River (film)|Mystic River]]'', ''[[Gone Baby Gone]]'' and ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]''.

Largely on the strength of its local writers, Boston was for some years the center of the U.S. publishing industry, before being overtaken by New York in the middle of the nineteenth century. Boston remains the home of publishers [[Houghton Mifflin]] and [[Pearson Education]], and was the longtime home of literary magazine ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]''. [[Merriam-Webster]] is based in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. ''[[Yankee Magazine|Yankee]]'', a magazine for New Englanders, is based in [[Dublin, New Hampshire]].

==Accents==
&lt;!---this subsection is completely unreferenced. It often sounds "top of the head" rather than scholarly for that reason---&gt;
There are several [[American English]] accents spoken in the region including [[New England English]] and [[Boston Accent]].

The [[New England English]] dialect and [[Boston accent]] are native to the region. Many of its most stereotypical features (such as [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|r dropping]] and the so-called [[broad A]]) are believed to have originated in Boston from the influence of England's [[Received Pronunciation]], which shares those features. While some Boston accents are most strongly associated with the so-called "[[the establishment|Eastern Establishment]]" and [[Boston Brahmin|Boston's upper class]], the common accent is locally prevalent and predominantly associated with blue-collar natives exemplified by movies like ''[[Good Will Hunting]]'' and ''[[The Departed]]''. The Boston accent and accents closely related to it cover eastern Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How We Talk: American Regional English Today.|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|last=Metcalf|first=Allan|url=http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/epub/how_we_talk.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Rhode Islanders speak with a [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] accent that many{{who|date=February 2012}} compare to a "Brooklyn" or a cross between a New York and [[Boston accent]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} ("water" becomes "wata"). Many Rhode Islanders distinguish the ''aw'' sound {{IPA|[ɔə̯]}}, as one might hear in New Jersey; e.g., the word ''coffee'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈkʰɔə̯fi]}}.&lt;ref name="rilang"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quahog.org/factsfolklore/index.php?id=43|title=Guide to Rhode Island Language Stuff|accessdate=May 30, 2007|publisher=Quahog.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of accent was brought to the region by early settlers from eastern England in the Puritan migration in the mid-seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;David Hackett Fischer, Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America (Oxford University Press, 1989), pg. 13–207 ({{ISBN|0195069056}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social activities and music==
In much of rural northern New England, particularly Maine, [[Acadian]] and [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] culture are included in music and dance. [[Contra dancing]] and country [[square dancing]] are popular throughout New England, usually backed by live Irish, Acadian, or other folk music.

[[File:HPIM0003.JPG|thumb|Opera houses and theaters, like the Vergennes Opera House in [[Vergennes, Vermont]], are popular in New England towns.]]
Traditional [[knitting]], [[quilting]] and [[Traditional Rug Hooking|rug hooking]] circles in rural New England have become less common; [[Church service|church]], sports, and [[town meeting|town government]] are more typical social activities. These traditional gatherings are often hosted in individual homes or civic centers; larger groups regularly assemble at special-purpose [[ice cream parlors]] that dot the countryside. New England leads the U.S. in ice cream consumption per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://boston.com/travel/explorene/specials/summer/gallery/new_england_ice_cream/|title=New England's best ice cream|work=The Boston Globe|accessdate=2008-01-14 | date=2007-04-27|first=Jennifer|last=Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harbus.org/2005/Surviving-the-New-England-3424/|title=Surviving the New England Winter: You Scream, I Scream, Ice Cream!|publisher=The Harvard Harbus|accessdate=2008-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., [[candlepin bowling]] is essentially confined to New England, where it was invented in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masscandlepin.com/id14.html|title=History of Candlepin Bowling|publisher=Massachusetts Bowling Association|accessdate=2007-08-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826123708/http://www.masscandlepin.com/id14.html|archivedate=2007-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!---Canada isn't in the US yet. one town in Ohio is covered by "essentially".----&gt;  [[Basketball]] was invented in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], and [[volleyball]] was invented in [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]].

New England was for some time an important center of [[American classical music]]. The [[Second New England School]] was instrumental in reinvigorating the tradition in the U.S. Prominent [[Musical modernism|modernist]] composers also come from the region, including [[Charles Ives]] and [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]]. Boston is the site of the [[New England Conservatory]] and the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]. The [[Yale School of Music]] in New Haven, CT is another renowned institution.

In rock music, the region has produced bands as different as [[Aerosmith]], [[Phish]], the [[Pixies]], and [[Boston (band)|Boston]]. [[Dick Dale]], a [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] native, helped popularize [[surf rock]]. The region has also become a hotbed for Hardcore Punk and Heavy Metal music (especially with regards to Metalcore and Deathcore).

==Media==
The leading U.S. cable TV sports broadcaster [[ESPN]] is headquartered in [[Bristol, Connecticut]]. New England has several regional cable networks, including [[New England Cable News]] (NECN) and the [[New England Sports Network]] (NESN). New England Cable News is the largest regional [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour]] [[United States cable news|cable news]] network in the U.S., broadcasting to more than 3.2 million homes in all of the New England states. Its studios are located in [[Newton, Massachusetts]], outside of Boston, and it maintains bureaus in [[Manchester, New Hampshire]]; [[Hartford, Connecticut]]; [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]; [[Portland, Maine]]; and [[Burlington, Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;New England Cable News. Available at [http://www.boston.com/news/necn/About/ Boston.com]. Retrieved July 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In much of Connecticut, including Litchfield, Fairfield, and New Haven counties it also broadcasts New York based news programs—this is due in part to the immense influence New York has on southern Connecticut's economy and culture. Many areas in southern Connecticut often listen to NYC based radio stations as well as local stations.

NESN broadcasts the [[Boston Red Sox]] baseball and [[Boston Bruins]] hockey throughout the region, except for southern Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;New England Sports Network. Available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20051107090857/http://www.boston.com/sports/nesn/aboutus/FAQ/ Boston.com]. Retrieved July 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Connecticut, save for Windham county in the state's northeast corner, and even southern Rhode Island, receives the [[YES Network]], which broadcasts the games of the [[New York Yankees]]. For the most part, the same areas also carry [[SportsNet New York]] (SNY), which broadcasts [[New York Mets]] games. Central Connecticut appears to be the rough line where fans root for New England/Boston teams and NYC based sports teams.

[[Comcast SportsNet New England]] broadcasts the games of the [[Boston Celtics]], [[New England Revolution]] and [[Boston Cannons]].

While most New England cities have daily newspapers, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' are distributed widely throughout the region. Major newspapers also include ''[[The Providence Journal]]'', ''[[Portland Press Herald]]'', and ''[[Hartford Courant]]'', the oldest continuously published newspaper in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;The Hartford Courant-Older Than the Nation : [http://www.courant.com/about/custom/thc/thc-history,0,1855918.htmlstory Courant.com]. Retrieved June 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comedy===
New Englanders are well represented in American comedy. Writers for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and late-night television programs often come by way of the [[Harvard Lampoon]]. ''[[Family Guy]]'', an animated sitcom situated in Rhode Island, as well as ''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', were created by [[Connecticut]] native and [[Rhode Island School of Design]] graduate [[Seth MacFarlane]]. A number of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (SNL) cast members have origins in New England, from [[Adam Sandler]] to [[Amy Poehler]], who also stars in the [[NBC]] television series ''[[Parks and Recreation (TV series)|Parks and Recreation]]''. Former ''[[The Daily Show|Daily Show]]'' correspondents [[Rob Corddry]] and [[Steve Carell]] are from Massachusetts, with the latter also being involved in film and [[The Office (U.S. TV series)|the American adaptation]] of ''[[The Office]]''.  The American ''Office'' also featured [[Dunder-Mifflin]] branches set in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] and [[Nashua, New Hampshire]].

Late-night television hosts [[Jay Leno]] and [[Conan O'Brien]] have origins in the Boston area. Notable stand-up comedians, including [[Dane Cook]], [[Steve Sweeney]], [[Steven Wright]], [[Sarah Silverman]], [[Lisa Lampanelli]], [[Denis Leary]], [[Lenny Clarke]], and [[Louis CK]], are also from the region. ''SNL'' cast member [[Seth Meyers]] once attributed the region's imprint on American humor to its "sort of wry New England sense of pointing out anyone who's trying to make a big deal of himself", with the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' suggesting that [[irony]] and sarcasm, as well as Irish influences, are its trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;What's So Funny?.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5130">The '''Declaration of Tokyo''' is a set of international guidelines for physicians concerning [[torture]] and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in relation to detention and imprisonment, which was adopted in October 1975 during the 29th General assembly of the [[World Medical Association]], and later editorially updated by the WMA in France, May 2005 and 2006. It declares torture to be "contrary to the laws of humanity",&lt;ref name="WMA DOT Policy Preamble"&gt;World Medical Association, ''Declaration of Tokyo.'' Preamble.&lt;/ref&gt;  and antithetical to the "higher purpose" of the [[physician]], which is to "alleviate the distress of his or her fellow human being."&lt;ref name="WMA DOT Policy Article 5"&gt;World Medical Association, ''Declaration of Tokyo.'' Section 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy states that doctors should refuse to participate in, condone, or give permission for torture, degradation, or cruel treatment of prisoners or detainees. According to the policy, a prisoner who [[Hunger strike|refuses to eat]] should not be [[Force-feeding|fed artificially against his will]], provided that he or she is judged to be rational.

==Content==
===Preamble ===
It is the privilege of the physician to practise [[medicine]] in the service of humanity, to preserve and restore bodily and [[mental health]] without distinction as to persons, to comfort and to ease the suffering of his or her patients. The utmost respect for human life is to be maintained even under threat, and no use made of any medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity.
For the purpose of this Declaration, torture is defined as the deliberate, systematic or wanton infliction of physical or mental suffering by one or more persons acting alone or on the orders of any authority, to force another person to yield information, to make a [[confession]], or for any other reason.

===Declaration===
#The physician shall not countenance, condone or participate in the practice of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading procedures, whatever the offense of which the victim of such procedures is suspected, accused or guilty, and whatever the victim's beliefs or motives, and in all situations, including armed conflict and civil strife.
#The physician shall not provide any premises, instruments, substances or knowledge to facilitate the practice of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or to diminish the ability of the victim to resist such treatment.
#When providing medical assistance to detainees or prisoners who are, or who could later be, under [[interrogation]], physicians should be particularly careful to ensure the confidentiality of all personal medical information. A breach of the [[Geneva Conventions]] shall in any case be reported by the physician to relevant authorities. The physician shall not use nor allow to be used, as far as he or she can, medical knowledge or skills, or health information specific to individuals, to facilitate or otherwise aid any interrogation, legal or illegal, of those individuals.
#The physician shall not be present during any procedure during which torture or any other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is used or threatened.
#A physician must have complete clinical independence in deciding upon the care of a person for whom he or she is medically responsible. The physician's fundamental role is to alleviate the distress of his or her fellow human beings, and no motive, whether personal, collective or political, shall prevail against this higher purpose.
#Where a prisoner refuses nourishment and is considered by the physician as capable of forming an unimpaired and rational judgment concerning the consequences of such a voluntary refusal of nourishment, he or she shall not be fed artificially. The decision as to the capacity of the prisoner to form such a judgment should be confirmed by at least one other independent physician. The consequences of the refusal of nourishment shall be explained by the physician to the prisoner.
#The World Medical Association will support, and should encourage the international community, the National Medical Associations and fellow physicians to support, the physician and his or her family in the face of threats or reprisals resulting from a refusal to condone the use of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.&lt;ref&gt;World Medical Association. Declaration of Tokyo (1975). Adopted by the World Medical Association, Tokyo, Japan. October 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Defensive Patent License''' ('''DPL''') is a [[patent license]] proposed by Jason Schultz and Jennifer Urban, directors of the [[Samuelson Law, Technology &amp; Public Policy Clinic]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] as a [[patent licensing]] equivalent of the [[GPL]] copyright license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/60939|title=The Defensive Patent License makes patents less evil for open source|publisher=[[Network World]]|author=Julie Bort|date=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2010/05/will-defensive-patent-license-be-able.html|title=Will the Defensive Patent License be able to make patents 'less evil' for Free and Open Source Software? |publisher=FOSS Patents|author=[[Florian Müller (author)|Florian Mueller]]|date=May 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttB_mjcIKcY|title=A Defensive Patent License Proposal |publisher=[[Stanford Center for Internet and Society]]/[[YouTube]]|author=Schultz and Urban |date=May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It requires entities licensing their patents under the DPL to license all of their patents under the DPL, with free licenses granted to all other DPL participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/06/defensive-patent-license-created-to-protect-innovators-from-trolls/|title="Defensive Patent License" created to protect innovators from trolls|publisher=[[Ars Technica]]|author=Jon Brodkin|date=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; DPL participants remain free to launch patent lawsuits against non-participants.

In [[archaeology]], an '''enclosure''' is one of the most common types of [[archaeological site]]. It is any area of land separated from surrounding land by [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]], walls or fencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.damerhamarchaeology.org/damerham/glossary/neolithic_enclosures|title=Damerham Archaeology Project {{!}} The Damerham Site|last=Project|first=Damerham Archaeology|website=www.damerhamarchaeology.org|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a simple feature is found all over the world and during almost all [[archaeological period]]s. They may be few metres across or be large enough to encompass whole cities.

Enclosures served numerous practical purposes including acting to delineate settlement areas, to create defensive positions or to be used as animal pens. They were also widely adopted in [[ritual]] and burial practices however and seem to demonstrate a fundamental human desire to make physical boundaries around spaces. Enclosures created from ditches and banks or walling can often be identified in the field through [[aerial photography]] or [[archaeological survey|ground survey]]. Other types leave less permanent records and may only be identified during [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]].

'''Engraving''' is the practice of incising a design onto a hard, usually flat surface by cutting grooves into it with a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]]. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold, steel, or [[Glass engraving|glass]] are engraved, or may provide an [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] printing plate, of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper as prints or illustrations; these images are also called "engravings". Engraving is one of the oldest and most important techniques in [[printmaking]]. [[Wood engraving]] is a form of [[relief printing]] and is not covered in this article.

Engraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper in artistic [[printmaking]], in [[mapmaking]], and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has long been replaced by various [[photographic]] processes in its commercial applications and, partly because of the difficulty of learning the technique, is much less common in printmaking, where it has been largely replaced by [[etching]] and other techniques.

"Engraving" is also loosely but incorrectly used for any old black and white print; it requires a degree of expertise to distinguish engravings from prints using other techniques such as [[etching]] in particular, but also [[mezzotint]] and other techniques. Many [[old master print]]s also combine techniques on the same plate, further confusing matters.  [[Line engraving]] and [[steel engraving]] cover use for reproductive prints, illustrations in books and magazines, and similar uses, mostly in the 19th century, and often not actually using engraving.

Traditional engraving, by [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] or with the use of machines, continues to be practised by [[goldsmith]]s, glass engravers, [[Gunsmith#Gun Engraver|gunsmiths]] and others, while modern industrial techniques such as [[photoengraving]] and [[laser engraving]] have many important applications. [[Engraved gem]]s were an important art in the ancient world, revived at the Renaissance, although the term traditionally covers [[relief]] as well as intaglio carvings, and is essentially a branch of sculpture rather than engraving, as drills were the usual tools.

==Terms==
[[Image:gravers.jpg|thumb|left|An assortment of hand engraving tools]]

Other terms often used for printed engravings are '''copper engraving''', '''copper-plate engraving''' or ''[[line engraving]]''. [[Steel engraving]] is the same technique, on steel or steel-faced plates, and was mostly used for banknotes, illustrations for books, magazines and reproductive prints, [[letterhead]]s and similar uses from about 1790 to the early 20th century, when the technique became less popular, except for banknotes and other forms of [[security printing]]. Especially in the past, "engraving" was often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching or [[mezzotint]]. "Hand engraving" is a term sometimes used for engraving objects other than printing plates, to inscribe or decorate jewellery, firearms, trophies, knives and other fine metal goods. Traditional engravings in printmaking are also "hand engraved", using just the same techniques to make the lines in the plate.

Each graver is different and has its own use. '''Engravers''' use a hardened steel tool called a burin, or graver, to cut the design into the surface, most traditionally a copper plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expositions.bnf.fr/bosse/grand/214.htm|title=Abraham Bosse|year=1645|publisher=Bibliothèque nationale de France|accessdate=15 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern hand engraving artists use burins or gravers to cut a variety of metals such as silver, nickel, steel, brass, gold, titanium, and more, in applications from weaponry to jewellery to motorcycles to found objects. Modern professional engravers can engrave with a resolution of up to 40 lines per mm in high grade work creating game scenes and scrollwork. [[Die (manufacturing)|Dies]] used in mass production of molded parts are sometimes hand engraved to add special touches or certain information such as part numbers.

In addition to hand engraving, there are engraving machines that require less human finesse and are not directly controlled by hand. They are usually used for lettering, using a [[pantograph]]ic system. There are versions for the insides of rings and also the outsides of larger pieces. Such machines are commonly used for inscriptions on rings, lockets and presentation pieces.

===Tools and gravers or burins===
Gravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that yield different line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. The angle tint tool has a slightly curved tip that is commonly used in printmaking. Florentine liners are flat-bottomed tools with multiple lines incised into them, used to do fill work on larger areas or to create uniform shade lines that are fast to execute. Ring gravers are made with particular shapes that are used by jewelry engravers in order to cut inscriptions inside rings. Flat gravers are used for fill work on letters, as well as "wriggle" cuts on most musical instrument engraving work, remove background, or create bright cuts. Knife gravers are for line engraving and very deep cuts. Round gravers, and flat gravers with a radius, are commonly used on silver to create bright cuts (also called '''bright-cut engraving'''), as well as other hard-to-cut metals such as nickel and steel. Square or V-point gravers are typically square or elongated diamond-shaped and used for cutting straight lines. V-point can be anywhere from 60 to 130 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]], depending on purpose and effect. These gravers have very small cutting points. Other tools such as [[mezzotint]] rockers, roulets and burnishers are used for texturing effects. Burnishing tools can also be used for certain stone setting techniques.

Musical instrument engraving on American-made brass instruments flourished in the 1920s and utilizes a specialized engraving technique where a flat graver is "walked" across the surface of the instrument to make zig-zag lines and patterns. The method for "walking" the graver may also be referred to as "wriggle" or "wiggle" cuts. This technique is necessary due to the thinness of metal used to make musical instruments versus firearms or jewelry. Wriggle cuts are commonly found on silver Western jewelry and other Western metal work.

===Tool geometry===
[[File:2008-engraving.jpg|right|thumb|Stone engraving]]
Tool geometry is extremely important for accuracy in hand engraving. When sharpened for most applications, a graver has a "face", which is the top of the graver, and a "heel", which is the bottom of the graver; not all tools or application require a heel. These two surfaces meet to form a point that cuts the metal. The geometry and length of the heel helps to guide the graver smoothly as it cuts the surface of the metal. When the tool's point breaks or chips, even on a microscopic level, the graver can become hard to control and produces unexpected results. Modern innovations have brought about new types of carbide that resist chipping and breakage, which hold a very sharp point longer between resharpening than traditional metal tools.

===Tool sharpening===
Sharpening a graver or burin requires either a [[sharpening stone]] or wheel. Harder carbide and steel gravers require diamond-grade sharpening wheels; these gravers can be polished to a mirror finish using a ceramic or cast iron lap, which is essential in creating bright cuts. Several low-speed, reversible sharpening system made specifically for hand engravers are available that reduce sharpening time. Fixtures that secure the tool in place at certain angles and geometries are also available to take the guesswork from sharpening to produce accurate points. Very few master engravers exist today who rely solely on "feel" and muscle memory to sharpen tools. These master engravers typically worked for many years as an apprentice, most often learning techniques decades before modern machinery was available for hand engravers. These engravers typically trained in such countries as Italy and Belgium, where hand engraving has a rich and long heritage of masters.

===Artwork design===
Design or artwork is generally prepared in advance, although some professional and highly experienced hand engravers are able to draw out minimal outlines either on paper or directly on the metal surface just prior to engraving. The work to be engraved may be lightly scribed on the surface with a sharp point, laser marked, drawn with a fine permanent marker (removable with acetone) or pencil, transferred using various chemicals in conjunction with inkjet or laser printouts, or [[Stipple engraving|stippled]]. Engraving artists may rely on hand drawing skills, copyright-free designs and images, computer-generated artwork, or common design elements when creating artwork.

===Handpieces===
Originally, handpieces varied little in design as the common use was to push with the handle placed firmly in the center of the palm. With modern pneumatic engraving systems, handpieces are designed and created in a variety of shapes and power ranges. Handpieces are made using various methods and materials. Knobs may be handmade from wood, molded and engineered from plastic, or machine-made from brass, steel, or other metals. The most widely known hand engraving tool maker, GRS Tools in Kansas is an American-owned and operated company that manufacture handpieces as well as many other tools for various applications in metal engraving.

===Cutting the surface===
[[Image:Louis George Meistergraveurin 2.jpg|thumb|left|Master engraver ennobling a watch movement. Top level engravers work under a [[stereo microscope]]. ]]

The actual engraving is traditionally done by a combination of pressure and manipulating the work-piece. The traditional "hand push" process is still practiced today, but modern technology has brought various mechanically assisted engraving systems. Most pneumatic engraving systems require an air source that drives air through a hose into a handpiece, which resembles a traditional engraving handle in many cases, that powers a mechanism (usually a piston). The air is actuated by either a foot control (like a gas pedal or sewing machine) or newer palm / hand control. This mechanism replaces either the "hand push" effort or the effects of a hammer. The internal mechanisms move at speeds up to 15,000 strokes per minute, thereby greatly reducing the effort needed in traditional hand engraving. These types of pneumatic systems are used for power assistance only and do not guide or control the engraving artist. One of the major benefits of using a pneumatic system for hand engraving is the reduction of fatigue and decrease in time spent working.

Hand engraving artists today employ a combination of hand push, pneumatic, rotary, or hammer and chisel methods. Hand push is still commonly used by modern hand engraving artists who create "bulino" style work, which is highly detailed and delicate, fine work; a great majority, if not all, traditional printmakers today rely solely upon hand push methods. Pneumatic systems greatly reduce the effort required for removing large amounts of metal, such as in deep relief engraving or Western bright cut techniques.

===Finishing===
Finishing the work is often necessary when working in metal that may rust or where a colored finish is desirable, such as a firearm. A variety of spray lacquers and finishing techniques exist to seal and protect the work from exposure to the elements and time. Finishing also may include lightly sanding the surface to remove small chips of metal called "burrs" that are very sharp and unsightly. Some engravers prefer high contrast to the work or design, using black paints or inks to darken removed (and lower) areas of exposed metal. The excess paint or ink is wiped away and allowed to dry before lacquering or sealing, which may or may not be desired by the artist.

===Modern hand engraving===
[[File:Hand engraving tool.jpg|thumb|Hand Engraving Tool Example]]

Because of the high level of microscopic detail that can be achieved by a master engraver, [[counterfeit]]ing of engraved designs is well-nigh impossible, and modern [[banknote]]s are almost always engraved, as are plates for printing money, checks, bonds and other security-sensitive papers. The engraving is so fine that a normal printer cannot recreate the detail of hand engraved images, nor can it be scanned. In the [[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]], more than one hand engraver will work on the same plate, making it nearly impossible for one person to duplicate all the engraving on a particular banknote or document.

The modern discipline of hand engraving, as it is called in a [[metalworking]] context, survives largely in a few specialized fields. The highest levels of the art are found on firearms and other metal weaponry, jewellery, and musical instruments.

In most commercial markets today, hand engraving has been replaced with milling using CNC engraving or [[milling machine]]s. Still, there are certain applications where use of hand engraving tools cannot be replaced.

===Machine engraving===
[[File:1847Colt Walker.jpg|thumb|1847 Colt Walker pistol with roll engraved cylinder]]
In some instances, images or designs can be transferred to metal surfaces via mechanical process. One such process is roll stamping or roller-die engraving. In this process, a hardened image die is pressed against the destination surface using extreme pressure to impart the image. In the 1800s [[pistol cylinder]]s were often decorated via this process to impart a continuous scene around its surface.

===Computer-aided machine engraving===
[[Image:Engraving on Corian.jpg|thumb|left|Computerized engraving on [[Corian]].]]
Engraving machines such as the K500 (packaging) or K6 (publication) by Hell Gravure Systems use a diamond stylus to cut cells. Each cell creates one printing dot later in the process. A K6 can have up to 18 engraving heads each cutting 8.000 cells per second to an accuracy of .1&amp;nbsp;µm and below. They are fully computer-controlled and the whole process of cylinder-making is fully automated.

It is now common place for retail stores (mostly jewellery, silverware or award stores) to have a small computer controlled engrave on site. This enables them to personalise the products they sell. Retail engraving machines tend to be focused around ease of use for the operator and the ability to do a wide variety of items including flat metal plates, jewelry of different shapes and sizes, as well as cylindrical items such as mugs and tankards. They will typically be equipped with a computer dedicated to graphic design that will enable the operator to easily design a text or picture graphic which the software will translate into digital signals telling the engraver machine what to do. Unlike industrial engravers, retail machines are smaller and only use one diamond head. This is interchangeable so the operator can use differently shaped diamonds for different finishing effects. They will typically be able to do a variety of metals and plastics. Glass and crystal engraving is possible, but the brittle nature of the material makes the process more time consuming.

Retail engravers mainly use two different processes. The first and most common 'Diamond Drag' pushes the diamond cutter through the surface of the material and then pulls to create scratches. These direction and depth are controlled by the computer input. The second is 'Spindle Cutter'. This is similar to Diamond Drag, but the engraving head is shaped in a flat V shape, with a small diamond and the base. The machine uses an electronic spindle to quickly rotate the head as it pushes it into the material, then pulls it along whilst it continues to spin. This creates a much bolder impression than diamond drag. It is used mainly for brass plaques and pet tags.

With state-of-the-art machinery it is easy to have a simple, single item complete in under ten minutes.
The engraving process with diamonds is state-of-the-art since the 1960s.

Today laser engraving machines are in development but still mechanical cutting has proven its strength in economical terms and quality. More than 4,000 engravers make approx. 8 Mio printing cylinders worldwide per year.

==History==
''For the printing process, see [[intaglio (printmaking)]]. For the Western art history of engraved prints, see [[old master print]] and [[line engraving]]''

The first evidence for humans engraving patterns is a chiselled shell, dating back between 540,000 and 430,000 years, from Trinil, in Java, Indonesia, where the first Homo erectus was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/news/2014/12/worlds-oldest-engraving-discovered/ World's oldest engraving discovered], Australian Geographic, 4 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Hatched banding upon ostrich eggshells used as water containers found in South Africa in the [[Diepkloof Rock Shelter]] and dated to the [[Middle Stone Age]] around 60,000 BC are the next documented case of human engraving.&lt;ref name="Texier"&gt;Texier PJ, Porraz G, Parkington J, Rigaud JP, Poggenpoel C, Miller C, Tribolo C, Cartwright C, Coudenneau A, Klein R, Steele T, Verna C. (2010). "A Howiesons Poort tradition of engraving ostrich eggshell containers dated to 60,000 years ago at Diepkloof Rock Shelter, South Africa". ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA''. {{doi|10.1073/pnas.0913047107}} {{PMID|20194764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engraving on bone and ivory is an important technique for the [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]], and larger engraved [[petroglyph]]s on rocks are found from many prehistoric periods and cultures around the world.

In [[Ancient history|antiquity]], the only engraving on metal that could be carried out is the shallow grooves found in some jewellery after the beginning of the 1st Millennium B.C. The majority of so-called engraved designs on ancient gold rings or other items were produced by [[chasing (metalworking)|chasing]] or sometimes a combination of [[lost-wax casting]] and chasing. [[Engraved gem]] is a term for any carved or engraved semi-precious stone; this was an important small-scale art form in the ancient world, and remained popular until the 19th century.
[[File:Battle of Engravers by George Cruikshank 1828.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Battle of Engravers'', [[satire|satirical]] [[etching]] by [[George Cruikshank]], showing hypothetical battle between the engravers, including [[William Hogarth]], [[Antoine Masson]], [[William Woollett]], [[Jean-Joseph Balechou]], [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Marcantonio Raimondi]].]]
However the use of [[glass engraving]], usually using a wheel, to cut decorative scenes or figures into glass vessels, in imitation of [[hardstone carving]]s, appears as early as the first century AD,&lt;ref name="Caron"&gt;Caron, B., A Roman Figure-Engraved Glass Bowl. Metropolitan Museum Journal, 1993. 28: p. 47–55.&lt;/ref&gt; continuing into the fourth century CE at urban centers such as Cologne and Rome,&lt;ref name="Fleming"&gt;Fleming, S.J., Roman Glass; reflections on cultural change. 1999, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.&lt;/ref&gt; and appears to have ceased sometime in the fifth century. Decoration was first based on Greek mythology, before hunting and circus scenes became popular, as well as imagery drawn from the Old and New Testament.&lt;ref name="Fleming" /&gt; It appears to have been used to mimic the appearance of precious metal wares during the same period, including the application of gold leaf, and could be cut free-hand or with lathes. As many as twenty separate stylistic workshops have been identified, and it seems likely that the engraver and vessel producer were separate craftsmen.&lt;ref name="Caron" /&gt;

In the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate and inscribe metalwork. It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them. From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to produce artistic images on paper, known as [[old master print]]s, in Germany in the 1430s. Italy soon followed. Many early engravers came from a goldsmithing background. The first and greatest period of the engraving was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as [[Martin Schongauer]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], and [[Lucas van Leiden]].

[[File:Rembrandt - self portrait etching.jpg|thumb|right|Modern impression of Rembrandt's 1639 self-portrait, with the engraving plate.]]
Thereafter engraving tended to lose ground to [[etching]], which was a much easier technique for the artist to learn. But many prints combined the two techniques: although [[Rembrandt]]'s prints are generally all called etchings for convenience, many of them have some burin or drypoint work, and some have nothing else. By the nineteenth century, most engraving was for commercial illustration.

Before the advent of photography, engraving was used to reproduce other forms of art, for example paintings. Engravings continued to be common in newspapers and many books into the early 20th century, as they were cheaper to use in printing than photographic images.

Many classic postage stamps were engraved, although the practice is now mostly confined to particular countries, or used when a more "elegant" design is desired and a limited color range is acceptable.

[[File:Buffalo nickles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Buffalo nickel]]s, coins customised with engraving tools]] 
Modifying the [[relief]] designs on coins is a craft dating back to the 18th century and today modified coins are known colloquially as [[hobo nickel]]s. In the United States, especially during the [[Great Depression]], coin engraving on the large-faced [[Buffalo nickel|Indian Head nickel]] became a way to help make ends meet. The craft continues today, and with modern equipment often produces stunning miniuture sculptural artworks and floral scrollwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2016/10/shaun-hughes-engraving/ Elaborate Floral Scrollwork Engraved on Coins] by Shaun Hughes embellishing existing coin faces with different styles of floral scrollwork (2016).  Retrieved May 27 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-20th century, a renaissance in hand-engraving began to take place. With the inventions of pneumatic hand-engraving systems that aided hand-engravers, the art and techniques of hand-engraving became more accessible. 

===Music engraving===
{{main|Music engraving}}
The first music printed from engraved plates dates from 1446 and most printed music was produced through engraving from roughly 1700–1860. From 1860–1990 most printed music was produced through a combination of engraved master plates reproduced through offset lithography.

The first comprehensive account is given by Mme Delusse in her article "Gravure en lettres, en géographie et en musique" in [[Diderot]]'s Encyclopedia. The technique involved a five-pointed raster to score staff lines, various punches in the shapes of notes and standard musical symbols, and various burins and scorers for lines and slurs. For correction, the plate was held on a bench by callipers, hit with a dot punch on the opposite side, and burnished to remove any signs of the defective work. The process involved intensive pre-planning of the layout, and many manuscript scores with engraver's planning marks survive from the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Poole|first=H. Edmund|title=Music Printing and Publishing|year=1980|publisher=Norton|location=New York|pages=40–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1837 [[pewter]] had replaced copper as a medium, and Berthiaud gives an account with an entire chapter devoted to music (''Novel manuel complet de l'imprimeur en taille douce'', 1837). Printing from such plates required a separate inking to be carried out cold, and the printing press used less pressure. Generally, four pages of music were engraved on a single plate. Because music engraving houses trained engravers through years of apprenticeship, very little is known about the practice. Fewer than one dozen sets of tools survive in libraries and museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gamble|first=William|title=Music Engraving and Printing: Historical and Technical Treatise|year=1923|publisher=Pitman|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1900 music engravers were established in several hundred cities in the world, but the art of storing plates was usually concentrated with publishers. Extensive bombing of Leipzig in 1944, the home of most German engraving and printing firms, destroyed roughly half the world's engraved music plates.

==Applications today==
[[File:Ars moriendi (Meister E.S.), L.181.png|thumb|[[Ars moriendi]] engraving by Master ES, circa 1450]]

Examples of contemporary uses for engraving include creating text on jewellery, such as pendants or on the inside of [[engagement ring|engagement]]- and [[wedding ring]]s to include text such as the name of the partner, or adding a winner's name to a sports trophy.  Another application of modern engraving is found in the [[printing]] industry. There, every day thousands of pages are mechanically engraved onto [[rotogravure]] cylinders, typically a steel base with a copper layer of about 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm in which the image is transferred. After engraving the image is protected with an approximately 6&amp;nbsp;µm chrome layer. Using this process the image will survive for over a million copies in high speed [[printing press]]es.  Engraving machines such as GUN BOW (one of the leading engraving brands) are the best examples of hand engraving tools, although this type of machine is typically not used for fine hand engraving.
Some schools throughout the world are renowned for their teaching of engraving, like the [[École Estienne]] in Paris.

==Creating tone==
[[Image:Claude Mellan - Face of Christ - WGA14764.jpg|thumb|''Sudarium of Saint Veronica'' by [[Claude Mellan]] (1649), a famous showpiece where the image is formed by a single continuous line, starting on the tip of Christ's nose.]]

In traditional engraving, which is a purely linear medium, the impression of [[half-tone]]s was created by making many very thin parallel lines, a technique called [[hatching]]. When two sets of parallel-line ''hatchings'' intersected each other for higher density, the resulting pattern was known as ''cross-hatching''. Patterns of dots were also used in a technique called [[stippling]], first used around 1505 by [[Giulio Campagnola]]. [[Claude Mellan]] was one of many 17th-century engravers with a very well-developed technique of using parallel lines of varying thickness (known as the "swelling line") to give subtle effects of tone (as was [[Hendrick Goltzius|Goltzius]]) – see picture below. One famous example is his ''[[Veil of Veronica|Sudarium of Saint Veronica]]'' (1649), an engraving of the face of Jesus made from a single spiraling line that starts at the tip of Jesus's nose.

==Biblical references==
The earliest allusion to engraving in the Bible may be the reference to [[Judah (Biblical figure)|Judah]]'s seal ring (Ge 38:18), followed by (Ex 39.30). Engraving was commonly done with pointed tools of iron or even with diamond points. (Jer 17:1).

Each of the two onyx stones on the shoulder-pieces of the high priest’s [[ephod]] was engraved with the names of six different tribes of [[Israel]], and each of the 12 precious stones that adorned his breastpiece was engraved with the name of one of the tribes. The holy sign of dedication, the shining gold plate on the high priest's turban, was engraved with the words: "Holiness belongs to [[Adonai]]." [[Bezalel]], along with Oholiab, was qualified to do this specialized engraving work as well as to train others.—Ex 35:30–35; 28:9–12; 39:6–14, 30.

The '''Globular Flute''' ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: Топчеста Флејта; [[Transliteration of Macedonian|Latinic]]: Topchesta flejta) is a [[Neolithic]] [[ocarina]]-type [[flute]] found in 1989 at the Mramor archaeological site near [[Čaška]] village, 15&amp;nbsp;km north of [[Veles (city)|Veles]] in the [[Republic of Macedonia]].

The artefact is an irregular spherical object made of refined reddish clay, with a diameter of 4.7&amp;nbsp;cm and a hollow interior. The surface of the object is without any decorative elements. The object is pierced with three holes with different diameters (0.4&amp;nbsp;cm and 0.6&amp;nbsp;cm), arranged like the apexes of a triangle. The hole positioned at one corner of the triangle is wider than the other two, which are identical. The object has been identified as a musical instrument by the excavators, an ocarina-type globular flute.&lt;ref&gt;Jovcevska, T., "Globular Flute". Skopje, 2007. (in Macedonian). A rough English translation version is here: [http://uzkn.gov.mk/dokumenti/flejta/GLOBULAR_FLUTE.pdf], and the illustrations from the original book are here: [http://uzkn.gov.mk/dokumenti/flejta/Ilustracii_Illustrations.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The flute has no find context, having been discovered in a ploughed field, but the date of the Neolithic settlement at Mramor ranges from between 5000 and 4000 BC. Although a unique object, experts consider it to be a demonstration of the type of technology available in Neolithic Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Wyatt, "Soul Music: Instruments in an Animistic Age", page 13, in "The Sounds of Stonehenge". Stephen Banfield (ed.), BAR British Series 504, Oxford 2009. [http://www.simonwyatt.webspace.virginmedia.com/SWigheard/pubs/Dr%20Simon%20Wyatt%202009%20SoulMusic.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known if the flute was for performing ritual music or for entertainment, but experiments have been carried out on the melodies produced by the instrument by musician [[Dragan Dautovski Quartet|Dragan Dautovski]] who has played a glass reproduction of the Mramor flute, revealing possible Neolithic melodic registers and scales.&lt;ref&gt;Goce Naumov, "Embodied Houses: the Social and Symbolic Agency of Neolithic Architecture in the Republic of Macedonia", page 77, in "Tracking the Neolithic House in Europe", D. Hofmann, J. Smyth (eds.). New York, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Dautovski has said that the [[timbre]] of the flute is "almost shocking", and the instrument is "a testimonial to the divine power of music as the oldest cosmic language".&lt;ref&gt;Dejan Trajkoski, "Dragan Dautovski: Music is the Oldest Language", 2011. [http://www.southeast-europe.eu/features/music0/dragan-dautovski-music-is-the-oldest-language.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:Złota brama w Gdańsku 1687 r.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Langgasser Tor'' in 1687]]

The '''Golden Gate''' (Polish: ''Złota Brama''; German: ''Langgasser Tor'') in [[Gdańsk]] (former German name: [[Danzig]]), [[Poland]], is one of the most notable [[tourist attraction]]s of the city.

It was created in 1612&amp;ndash;14 in place of a 13th-century [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] gate, the ''Brama Długouliczna'' (Long Street Gate). It is located at one end of [[Long Lane, Gdańsk|Long Lane]] (''ulica Długa''; {{lang-de|[[:de:Langgasse Danzig|Langgasse]]}}), where, together with Brama Wyżynna (German: ''Hohes Tor'' = High Gate) and Wieża Więzienna (German: ''Stockturm'' = Prison Tower), it forms a part of the old city fortifications.

It was designed by architect [[Abraham van den Blocke]] and was built by Jan Strakowski. The architectural style of the gate is Dutch [[mannerism]]. Next to it is the late-gothic building of the Brotherhood of [[Saint George|St.George]].

Both sides of the gate have [[attique]]s, with figures symbolizing the qualities of the  ideal citizen. They were designed in 1648 by [[Jeremias Falck]] ("Polonus"), and reconstructed in 1878 due to the originals being damaged by weathering over time.

From the West side they represent (in [[Latin]]): ''Pax'' (Peace), ''Libertas'' (Freedom), ''Fortuna'' (Wealth) and ''Fama'' (Fame). From the East (Long Lane) side  they are ''Concordia'' (Agreement), ''Iustitia'' (Justice), ''Pietas'' (Piety) and ''Prudentia'' (Prudency). The Latin inscription on the gates reads: ''Concordia res publicæ parvæ crescunt – discordia magnæ concidunt'' ("In agreement small republics grow, because of disagreement great republics fall").

The gate was largely destroyed by Soviet shelling in [[World War II]], but was rebuilt in 1957. Although most artifacts of Germanness were eradicated after the city became Polish in 1945, an original German inscription on the gate was restored in the 1990s: ''{{lang|de|Es müsse wohl gehen denen, die dich lieben. Es müsse Friede sein inwendig in deinen Mauern und Glück in deinen Palästen}}'' ("They shall prosper that love thee. Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces." – [[Psalm 122]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7980">'''Gudrun Corvinus''' (1932–2006) was a German [[geologist]], [[paleontologist]] and [[archaeologist]].

She was murdered in her home in [[Pune, India]], on 7 January 2006.

== Education and career ==
Corvinus was born in [[Stettin]], then part of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]], in 1932. She studied geology, [[vertebrate paleontology]] and [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic]] archaeology at the [[University of Bonn]], and completed her doctoral dissertation on [[Jurassic]] [[Ammonites]] from France. Later in her career she was affiliated with the [[University of Tübingen]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chauhan|first1=Parth R.|last2=Patnaik|first2=Rajeev|date=1 December 2008|title=Gudrun Corvinus (1932–2006)—Pioneering paleoanthropologist|journal=Quaternary International|publisher=|volume=192|issue=1|pages=1–5|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2007.11.023|bibcode=2008QuInt.192....1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After marrying a man from [[Pune]], Corvinus became interested in the geology and prehistory of India, which became the main focus of her research.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt; She also worked in Africa, being part of the team that discovered [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]], a female hominin belonging to ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Corvinus|first=G.|date=1 June 1976|title=Prehistoric exploration at Hadar, Ethiopia|journal=Nature|publisher=|volume=261|issue=5561|pages=571–572|bibcode=1976Natur.261..571C|doi=10.1038/261571a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other prehistoric hominin sites in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Semaw|first=S.|last2=Renne|first2=P.|last3=Harris|first3=J.

Gudrun was not recognized immediately following her work and was not credited for her contribution towards her field.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

== Research in India ==
In 1964, Corvinus examined the Pravara drainage system in the Nevasa area of Maharashtra through an independent multi-disciplinary project. After a survey on the geomorphology of the entire Pravara Valley, suggested by H.D. Sankalia, Corvinus came across the Archeulian factory site at the junction of Chirki with the Pravara, 2 miles downstream from Nevasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=35DP1Z-2dnYC&amp;pg=PP15&amp;lpg=PP15&amp;dq=Studies+in+Indian+Archaeology:+Professor+H.D.+Sankalia+Felicitation+Volume+By+Hasmukhlal+Dhirajlal+Sankalia,+Shantaram+Bhalchandra+Deo,+Madhukar+Keshav+Dhavalikar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8AX_tnwzIn&amp;sig=rSK_NF99eAiyzpFoLjO2PkYHxL8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR5L_41NbQAhWF2YMKHcwSD7QQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Studies%20in%20Indian%20Archaeology:%20Professor%20H.D.%20Sankalia%20Felicitation%20Volume%20By%20Hasmukhlal%20Dhirajlal%20Sankalia,%20Shantaram%20Bhalchandra%20Deo,%20Madhukar%20Keshav%20Dhavalikar&amp;f=false|title=Studies in Indian Archaeology: Professor H.D.

The lengthy excavation resulted in the revelation of rich Early Archeulian assemblage in fine-grained context in the gullies of Chirki area. Besides this, a great number of well-preserved fossil wood pieces and tree trunks were found in the alluvium. In 1981, Corvinus published two of the most classic monographs, “ A Survey of the Pravara River System in Western Maharashtra, India” and “ A Survey of the Pravara River System in Western Maharashtra, India” in 1983.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chauhan|first=Parth R.|last2=Patnaik|first2=Rajeev|date=2008-12-01|title=Gudrun Corvinus (1932–2006)—Pioneering paleoanthropologist|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/240424007_Gudrun_Corvinus_1932-2006-Pioneering_paleoanthropologist|journal=Quaternary International|volume=192|issue=1|pages=1–5|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2007.11.023|issn=1040-6182|bibcode=2008QuInt.192....1C}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes her the first to publish monographs on the geology and archaeology of an Archaeulian site in the entire Indian subcontinent.

In 1985, following her work at Chirki-on-Neval (India), Gudrun Cornivus began explorations in the foothills of Siwalik Hills of Western Nepal. In the span of twelve years (1988-2006), she was rewarded with findings and discoveries of numerous Paleolithic sites and rich faunal and floral assemblages ranging from the Miocene to the Pleistocene.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The discovery of an unexpected wealth of occupation sites from the Paleolithic to the Neolithic were found in the Dun Valleys of Dang-Deokhuri District in the Siwalik Hills, and an area along the Rato River in East Nepal. From a sandstone succession near Rato Khola, Corvinus discovered the skull of ''Archidiskodon planifrons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corvinus|first1=Gudrun|last2=Nanda|first2=Avinash C.|date=1993|title=Stratigraphy and palaeontology of the Siwalik Group of Surai Khola and Rato Khola in Nepal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Avinash_Nanda3/publication/284106059_Stratigraphy_and_palaeontology_of_the_Siwalik_Group_of_Surai_Khola_and_Rato_Khola_in_Nepal/links/56fa6ba808ae95e8b6d4a284.pdf|journal=N. [b. Geol. Palaont. Abh.|publisher=Stuttgart|volume=1|issue=191|pages=25-68|accessdate=October 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of hand axe indicate human occupation can be dated back at least the late Middle Pleistocene. Most significantly, her finding of the Acheulian sites demonstrates that despite the scarce materials, the early South Asian Acheulian hominins were able to cross the vast Indo-Gangetic floodplain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Murder ==
On 7 January 2006, Corvinus was found stabbed and beheaded in her apartment in Pune. Her head was found in a nearby riverbed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Fakir Mohammed Shaikh, a 27-year-old real estate agent, was found guilty of her murder and sentenced to life in prison and a Rs 11,000 fine. He was also found guilty of destroying evidence and theft, carrying a sentence of seven years and three years of [[rigorous imprisonment]] respectively. The public prosecutor of the case, Neelima Vartak, stated that she was murdered for her property.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Realtor-gets-life-term-for-murder-of-German-archaeologist/articleshow/3985854.cms|title=Realtor gets life term for murder of German archaeologist|last=|first=|date=|newspaper=The Times of India|access-date=2016-11-03|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gynophobia''' or '''gynephobia''' is an abnormal fear of [[women]], a type of [[specific social phobia]].&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=gynophobia|title=WordNet|publisher=[[Princeton University]]|accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the past, the [[Latin language|Latin]] term '''horror feminae''' was used.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Joseph Corsini (1999) "The Dictionary of Psychology", {{ISBN|1-58391-028-X}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cB5UOSsIN74C&amp;pg=PA452&amp;lpg=PA452&amp;dq=%22horror+feminae%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=h67xmMg_vC&amp;sig=Rw7to8rctM7mo80092WoahoHhcU p. 452]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gynophobia should not be confused with [[misogyny]], the hatred, contempt for and prejudice against [[women]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/misogyny?q=misogyny&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/misogyny&lt;/ref&gt; although some may use the terms interchangeably, in reference to the social, rather than pathological aspect of negative [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] towards women.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Gaylard, ''Hollow Men: Writing, Objects, and Public Image in Renaissance Italy'',  [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAbRCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 p. 86]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[antonym]] of misogyny is [[philogyny]], the [[love]], respect for and [[admiration]] of [[women]].&lt;ref name="wordnet2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=philogyny|title=WordNet|publisher=[[Princeton University]]|accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This term is analogous with [[androphobia]], the abnormal or irrational fear of [[men]].

==Etymology==
The term ''gynophobia'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] γυνή - ''gunē'', meaning "woman"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dgunh%2F γυνή], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and  φόβος - ''phobos'', "fear".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dfo%2Fbos φόβος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyponyms of the term "gynophobia" include ''feminophobia'',&lt;ref&gt;The Shattered Mirror: Representations of Women in Mexican Literature, María Elena de Valdés, 2010, p 74&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Gynophobia was previously considered a driving force toward [[homosexuality]]. In his 1896 ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'', [[Havelock Ellis]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is, perhaps, not difficult to account for the horror&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; much stronger than that normally felt toward a person of the same sex&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; with which the [[Sexual inversion (sexology)|invert]] often regards the [[sexual organs]] of persons of the opposite sex. It cannot be said that the sexual organs of either sex under the influence of [[sexual excitement]] are esthetically pleasing; they only become emotionally desirable through the parallel excitement of the beholder. When the absence of parallel excitement is accompanied in the beholder by the sense of unfamiliarity as in childhood, or by a neurotic hypersensitiveness, the conditions are present for the production of intense ''horror feminae'' or ''horror masculis'', as the case may be. It is possible that, as [[Otto Rank]] argues in his interesting study, "Die Nacktheit in Sage und Dichtung," [''sic''] this horror of the sexual organs of the opposite sex, to some extent felt even by normal people, is embodied in the [[Melusine]] type of legend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/e#a2654 Works of Havelock Ellis] at [[Project Gutenberg]]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his book ''Sadism and Masochism: The Psychology of Hatred and Cruelty'', [[Wilhelm Stekel]]  discusses ''horror feminae'' of a male [[Sadomasochism|masochist]].

In ''The Dread of Woman'' (1932), [[Karen Horney]] traced the male dread of woman to the boy's fear that his genital is inadequate in relation to the mother.&lt;ref&gt;Horney &amp; Humanistic Psychoanalysis, http://plaza.ufl.edu/bjparis/ikhs/horney/fadiman/04_major.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Eva Keuls argues that violent [[Amazons]] are the evidence of the obsessive fear of women in [[Classical Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;Eva C. Keuls, "The Reign of the [[Phallus]]: Sexual Politics in Ancient Athens", {{ISBN|0-520-07929-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Fke7pcstmv0C&amp;pg=PA4 pp. 3-4]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Quintus Horatius Flaccus''' (December 8, 65 BC – November 27, 8 BC), known in the English-speaking world as '''Horace''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒr|ɪ|s}}), was the leading [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Lyric poetry|lyric poet]] during the time of [[Augustus]] (also known as Octavian). The rhetorician [[Quintilian]] regarded his ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]'' as just about the only Latin lyrics worth reading: "He can be lofty sometimes, yet he is also full of charm and grace, versatile in his figures, and felicitously daring in his choice of words."&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Quintilian 10.1.96. The only other lyrical poet Quintilian thought comparable with Horace was the now obscure poet/metrical theorist, [[Caesius Bassus]] (R. Tarrant, ''Ancient Receptions of Horace'', 280)&lt;/ref&gt;

Horace also crafted elegant [[Prosody (Latin)|hexameter verses]] (''[[Satires (Horace)|Satires]]'' and ''[[Epistles (Horace)|Epistles]]'') and caustic [[Iambus (genre)|iambic poetry]] (''[[Epodes]]''). The hexameters are amusing yet serious works, friendly in tone, leading the ancient satirist [[Persius]] to comment: "as his friend laughs, Horace slyly puts his finger on his every fault; once let in, he plays about the heartstrings".&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Translated from Persius' own 'Satires' 1.116–17: "omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico / tangit et admissus circum praecordia ludit."&lt;/ref&gt;

His career coincided with Rome's momentous change from a [[republic]] to an [[empire]]. An officer in the republican army defeated at the [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42 BC, he was befriended by Octavian's right-hand man in civil affairs, [[Maecenas]],  and became a spokesman for the new regime. For some commentators, his association with the regime was a delicate balance in which he maintained a strong measure of independence (he was "a master of the graceful sidestep")&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;J. Michie, ''The Odes of Horace'', 14&lt;/ref&gt; but for others he was, in [[John Dryden]]'s phrase, "a well-mannered court slave".&lt;ref&gt;N. Rudd, ''The Satires of Horace and Persius'', 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Quoted by [[Niall Rudd|N. Rudd]] from John Dryden's ''Discourse Concerning the Original and Progress of Satire'', excerpted from W.P.Ker's edition of Dryden's essays, Oxford 1926, vol. 2, pp. 86–7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
[[File:Horatii Flacci Sermonum.tif|thumb|''Horatii Flacci Sermonum'' (1577)]]
Horace can be regarded as the world's first autobiographer&lt;ref&gt;R. Barrow R., ''The Romans'' Pelican Books, 119&lt;/ref&gt; – In his writings, he tells us far more about himself, his character, his development, and his way of life than any other great poet in antiquity. Some of the biographical writings contained in his writings can be supplemented from the short but valuable "Life of Horace" by [[Suetonius]] (in his ''Lives of the Poets'').&lt;ref&gt;Fraenkel, Eduard. ''Horace.'' Oxford: 1957, p. 1.&lt;br /&gt;
For the Life of Horace by Suetonius, see: ([http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/6399/pg6399.html ''Vita Horati''])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood===
He was born on 8 December 65 BC&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The year is given in ''Odes'' 3.21.1 ([[Lucius Manlius Torquatus|"Consule Manlio"]]), the month in ''Epistles'' 1.20.27, the day in Suetonius' biography ''Vita'' (R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 7)&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Samnites|Samnite]] south of [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Brill's Companion to Horace'', edited by Hans-Christian Günther, Brill, 2012, p.7, [https://books.google.com/books?id=N2b0YUwXfM8C&amp;pg=PA7 Google Book]&lt;/ref&gt; His home town, [[Venosa|Venusia]], lay on a trade route in the border region between [[Apulia]] and [[Lucania]] ([[Basilicata]]). Various Italic dialects were spoken in the area and this perhaps enriched his feeling for language. He could have been familiar with Greek words even as a young boy and later he poked fun at the jargon of mixed Greek and Oscan spoken in neighbouring [[Canusium]].&lt;ref&gt;''Satires'' 1.10.30&lt;/ref&gt; One of the works he probably studied in school was the ''Odyssia'' of [[Livius Andronicus]], taught by teachers like the '[[Orbilius]]' mentioned in one of his poems.&lt;ref&gt;''Epistles'' 2.1.69 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Army veterans could have been settled there at the expense of local families uprooted by Rome as punishment for their part in the [[Social War (91–88 BC)]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; Such state-sponsored migration must have added still more linguistic variety to the area. According to a local tradition reported by Horace,&lt;ref&gt;''Satires'' 2.1.34&lt;/ref&gt; a colony of Romans or Latins had been installed in Venusia after the [[Samnites]] had been driven out early in the third century. In that case, young Horace could have felt himself to be a Roman&lt;ref&gt;T. Frank, ''Catullus and Horace'', 133–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Campbell, ''Horace: A New Interpretation'', 84&lt;/ref&gt; though there are also indications that he regarded himself as a Samnite or [[Sabellus]] by birth.&lt;ref&gt;''Epistles'' 1.16.49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 7&lt;/ref&gt; Italians in modern and ancient times have always been devoted to their home towns, even after success in the wider world, and Horace was no different. Images of his childhood setting and references to it are found throughout his poems.&lt;ref&gt;E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Horace's father was probably a Venutian taken captive by Romans in the Social War, or possibly he was descended from a [[Sabine]] captured in the [[Samnite Wars]]. Either way, he was a slave for at least part of his life. He was evidently a man of strong abilities however and managed to gain his freedom and improve his social position. Thus Horace claimed to be the free-born son of a prosperous 'coactor'.&lt;ref name="Kiernan"&gt;V. Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 24&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'coactor' could denote various roles, such as tax collector, but its use by Horace&lt;ref&gt;''Satires'' 1.6.86&lt;/ref&gt; was explained by [[scholia]] as a reference to 'coactor argentareus' i.e. an auctioneer with some of the functions of a banker, paying the seller out of his own funds and later recovering the sum with interest from the buyer.&lt;ref&gt;E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The father spent a small fortune on his son's education, eventually accompanying him to [[Rome]] to oversee his schooling and moral development. The poet later paid tribute to him in a poem&lt;ref name="Satires 1.6"&gt;''Satires'' 1.6&lt;/ref&gt; that one modern scholar considers the best memorial by any son to his father.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;"No son ever set a finer monument to his father than Horace did in the sixth satire of Book I...Horace's description of his father is warm-hearted but free from sentimentality or exaggeration. We see before us one of the common people, a hard-working, open-minded, and thoroughly honest man of simple habits and strict convictions, representing some of the best qualities that at the end of the Republic could still be found in the unsophisticated society of the Italian ''municipia''"{{emdash}}E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; The poem includes this passage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If my character is flawed by a few minor faults, but is otherwise decent and moral, if you can point out only a few scattered blemishes on an otherwise immaculate surface, if no one can accuse me of greed, or of prurience, or of profligacy, if I live a virtuous life, free of defilement (pardon, for a moment, my self-praise), and if I am to my friends a good friend, my father deserves all the credit... As it is now, he deserves from me unstinting gratitude and praise. I could never be ashamed of such a father, nor do I feel any need, as many people do, to apologize for being a freedman's son. ''[[Satire]]s 1.6.65–92''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He never mentioned his mother in his verses and he might not have known much about her. Perhaps she also had been a slave.&lt;ref name="Kiernan"/&gt;

===Adulthood===
Horace left Rome, possibly after his father's death, and continued his formal education in Athens, a great centre of learning in the ancient world, where he arrived at nineteen years of age, enrolling in [[Platonic Academy|The Academy]]. Founded by [[Plato]], The Academy was now dominated by [[Epicureans]] and [[Stoics]], whose theories and practises made a deep impression on the young man from Venusia.&lt;ref&gt;V. Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 25&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, he mixed and lounged about with the elite of Roman youth, such as Marcus, the idle son of [[Cicero]], and the Pompeius to whom he later addressed a poem.&lt;ref&gt;''Odes'' 2.7&lt;/ref&gt; It was in Athens too that he probably acquired deep familiarity with the ancient tradition of Greek lyric poetry, at that time largely the preserve of grammarians and academic specialists (access to such material was easier in Athens than in Rome, where the public libraries had yet to be built by [[Asinius Pollio]] and Augustus).&lt;ref&gt;E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 8–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome's troubles following the assassination of [[Julius Caesar]] were soon to catch up with him. [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] came to Athens seeking support for the republican cause. Brutus was fêted around town in grand receptions and he made a point of attending academic lectures, all the while recruiting supporters among the young men studying there, including Horace.&lt;ref&gt;E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; An educated young Roman could begin military service high in the ranks and Horace was made [[tribunus militum]] (one of six senior officers of a typical legion), a post usually reserved for men of  senatorial or equestrian rank and which seems to have inspired jealousy among his well-born confederates.&lt;ref&gt;''Satires'' 1.6.48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nisbet"&gt;R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 8&lt;/ref&gt; He learned the basics of military life while on the march, particularly in the wilds of northern Greece, whose rugged scenery became a backdrop to some of his later poems.&lt;ref&gt;V. Kiernan, ''Horace'', 25&lt;/ref&gt; It was there in 42 BC that [[Octavian]] (later [[Augustus]]) and his associate [[Mark Antony]] crushed the republican forces at the [[Battle of Philippi]]. Horace later recorded it as a day of embarrassment for himself, when he fled without his shield,&lt;ref&gt;''Odes'' 2.7.10&lt;/ref&gt; but allowance should be made for his self-deprecating humour. Moreover, the incident allowed him to identify himself with some famous poets who had long ago abandoned their shields in battle, notably his heroes [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] and [[Archilochus]]. The comparison with the latter poet is uncanny: Archilochus lost his shield in a part of Thrace near Philippi, and he was deeply involved in the Greek colonization of [[Thasos]], where Horace's die-hard comrades finally surrendered.&lt;ref name="Nisbet"/&gt;

Octavian offered an early amnesty to his opponents and Horace quickly accepted it. On returning to Italy, he was confronted with yet another loss: his father's estate in Venusia was one of many throughout Italy to be confiscated for the settlement of veterans ([[Virgil]] lost his estate in the north about the same time). Horace later claimed that he was reduced to poverty and this led him to try his hand at poetry.&lt;ref&gt;''Epistles'' 2.2.51–2&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, there was no money to be had from versifying. At best, it offered future prospects through contacts with other poets and their patrons among the rich.&lt;ref&gt;V. Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and politics''&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, he obtained the sinecure of ''scriba quaestorius'', a civil service position at the ''aerarium'' or Treasury, profitable enough to be purchased even by members of the ''ordo equester'' and not very demanding in its work-load, since tasks could be delegated to ''scribae'' or permanent clerks.&lt;ref&gt;E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; It was about this time that he began writing his ''Satires'' and ''Epodes''.

====Poet====
[[File:Fedor Bronnikov 014.jpg|thumb|Horace reads before Maecenas, by [[Fyodor Bronnikov]]]]

The ''Epodes'' belong to [[iambic poetry]]. Iambic poetry features insulting and obscene language;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Brown, in ''A Companion to the Greek Lyric Poets'', D.E.Gerber (ed), Leiden 1997, pages 13–88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas E. Gerber, ''Greek Iambic Poetry'', Loeb Classical Library (1999), Introduction pages i–iv&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes, it is referred to as ''blame poetry''.&lt;ref&gt;D. Mankin, ''Horace: Epodes'',C.U.P., 8&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blame poetry'', or ''shame poetry'', is poetry written to blame and shame fellow citizens into a sense of their social obligations. Horace modelled these poems on the poetry of [[Archilochus]]. Social bonds in Rome had been decaying since the destruction of [[Carthage]] a little more than a hundred years earlier, due to the vast wealth that could be gained by plunder and corruption.&lt;ref&gt;D. Mankin, ''Horace: Epodes'', 6&lt;/ref&gt; These social ills were magnified by rivalry between Julius Caesar, Mark Antony and confederates like [[Sextus Pompey]], all jockeying for a bigger share of the spoils. One modern scholar has counted a dozen civil wars in the hundred years leading up to 31 BC, including the [[Spartacus]] rebellion, eight years before Horace's birth.&lt;ref&gt;R. Conway, ''New Studies of a Great Inheritance'', 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; As the heirs to Hellenistic culture, Horace and his fellow Romans were not well prepared to deal with these problems:

{{Quotation|At bottom, all the problems that the times were stirring up were of a social nature, which the Hellenistic thinkers were ill qualified to grapple with. Some of them censured oppression of the poor by the rich, but they gave no practical lead, though they may have hoped to see well-meaning rulers doing so. Philosophy was drifting into absorption in self, a quest for private contentedness, to be achieved by self-control and restraint, without much regard for the fate of a disintegrating community.|[[V. G. Kiernan]]&lt;ref&gt;V. Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Horace's Hellenistic background is clear in his Satires, even though the genre was unique to Latin literature. He brought to it a style and outlook suited to the social and ethical issues confronting Rome but he changed its role from public, social engagement to private meditation.&lt;ref&gt;F. Muecke, ''The Satires'', 109–10&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, he was beginning to interest Octavian's supporters, a gradual process described by him in one of his satires.&lt;ref name="Satires 1.6"/&gt; The way was opened for him by his friend, the poet Virgil, who had gained admission into the privileged circle around Maecenas, Octavian's lieutenant, following the success of his  ''[[Eclogues]]''. An introduction soon followed and, after a discreet interval, Horace too was accepted. He depicted the process as an honourable one, based on merit and mutual respect, eventually leading to true friendship, and there is reason to believe that his relationship was genuinely friendly, not just with Maecenas but afterwards with Augustus as well.&lt;ref&gt;R. Lyne, ''Augustan Poetry and Society'', 599&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the poet has been unsympathetically described by one scholar as "a sharp and rising young man, with an eye to the main chance."&lt;ref&gt;J. Griffin, ''Horace in the Thirties'', 6&lt;/ref&gt; There were advantages on both sides: Horace gained encouragement and material support, the politicians gained a hold on a potential dissident.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 10&lt;/ref&gt; His republican sympathies, and his role at Philippi, may have caused him some pangs of remorse over his new status. However most Romans considered the civil wars to be the result of ''contentio dignitatis'', or rivalry between the foremost families of the city, and he too seems to have accepted the principate as Rome's last hope for much needed peace.&lt;ref&gt;D. Mankin, ''Horace: Epodes'', 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 37 BC, Horace accompanied Maecenas on a journey to [[Brundisium]], described in one of his poems&lt;ref&gt;''Satires'' 1.5&lt;/ref&gt; as a series of amusing incidents and charming encounters with other friends along the way, such as Virgil. In fact the journey was political in its motivation, with Maecenas en route to negotiatie the [[Treaty of Tarentum]] with Antony, a fact Horace artfully keeps from the reader (political issues are largely avoided in the first book of satires).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Horace was probably also with Maecenas on one of Octavian's naval expeditions against the piratical Sextus Pompeius, which ended in a disastrous storm off [[Palinurus]] in 36 BC, briefly alluded to by Horace in terms of near-drowning.&lt;ref&gt;''Odes'' 3.4.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;''Odes'' 3.4.28: "nec (me extinxit) Sicula Palinurus unda"; "nor did Palinurus extinguish me with Sicilian waters". Maecenas' involvement is recorded by [[Appian]] ''Bell. Civ.'' 5.99 but Horace's ode is the only historical reference to his own presence there, depending however on interpretation. (R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 10)&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some indications in his verses that he was with Maecenas at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, where Octavian defeated his great rival, Antony.&lt;ref&gt;''Epodes'' 1 and 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The point is much disputed among scholars and hinges on how the text is interpreted. ''Epodes'' 9 for example may offer proof of Horace's presence if 'ad hunc frementis' ('gnashing at this' man i.e. the traitrous Roman ) is a misreading of 'at huc...verterent' (but hither...they fled) in lines describing the defection of the Galatian cavalry, "ad hunc frementis verterunt bis mille equos / Galli canentes Caesarem" (R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 12).&lt;/ref&gt; By then Horace had already received from Maecenas the famous gift of his [[Horace's villa|Sabine farm]], probably not long after the publication of the first book of ''Satires''. The gift, which included income from five tenants, may have ended his career at the Treasury, or at least allowed him to give it less time and energy.&lt;ref&gt;E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 15&lt;/ref&gt; It signalled his identification with the Octavian regime yet, in the second book of ''Satires'' that soon followed, he continued the apolitical stance of the first book. By this time, he had attained the status of ''eques Romanus'',&lt;ref&gt;''Satires'' 2.7.53&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps as a result of his work at the Treasury.&lt;ref&gt;R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 11&lt;/ref&gt;

====Knight====

''Odes'' 1–3 were the next focus for his artistic creativity. He adapted their forms and themes from Greek lyric poetry of the seventh and sixth centuries BC. The fragmented nature of the [[Greek world]] had enabled his literary heroes to express themselves freely and his semi-retirement from the Treasury in Rome to [[Horace's Villa|his own estate]] in the Sabine hills perhaps empowered him to some extent also&lt;ref&gt;V. Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 61–2&lt;/ref&gt; yet even when his lyrics touched on public affairs they reinforced the importance of private life.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Nevertheless, his work in the period 30–27 BC began to show his closeness to the regime and his sensitivity to its developing ideology. In ''Odes'' 1.2, for example, he eulogized Octavian in hyperboles that echo Hellenistic court poetry. The name ''Augustus'', which Octavian assumed in January 27 BC, is first attested in ''Odes'' 3.3 and 3.5. In the period 27–24 BC, political allusions in the ''Odes'' concentrated on foreign wars in Britain (1.35), Arabia (1.29) Spain (3.8) and Parthia (2.2). He greeted Augustus on his return to Rome in 24 BC as a beloved ruler upon whose good health he depended for his own happiness (3.14).&lt;ref&gt;R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The public reception of ''Odes'' 1–3 disappointed him however. He attributed the lack of success to jealousy among imperial courtiers and to his isolation from literary cliques.&lt;ref&gt;''Epistles'' 1.19.35–44&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps it was disappointment that led him to put aside the genre in favour of verse letters. He addressed his first book of ''Epistles'' to a variety of friends and acquaintances in an urbane style reflecting his new social status as a knight. In the opening poem, he professed a deeper interest in moral philosophy than poetry&lt;ref&gt;''Epistles'' 1.1.10&lt;/ref&gt; but, though the collection demonstrates a leaning towards stoic theory, it reveals no sustained thinking about ethics.&lt;ref&gt;V. Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 149, 153&lt;/ref&gt; Maecenas was still the dominant confidante but Horace had now begun to assert his own independence, suavely declining constant invitations to attend his patron.&lt;ref&gt;''Epistles'' 1.7&lt;/ref&gt; In the final poem of the first book of ''Epistles'', he revealed himself to be forty-four years old in the consulship of Lollius and Lepidus i.e. 21 BC, and "of small stature, fond of the sun, prematurely grey, quick-tempered but easily placated".&lt;ref&gt;''Epistles'' 1.20.24–5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Suetonius, the second book of ''Epistles'' was  prompted by Augustus, who desired a verse epistle to be addressed to himself. Augustus was in fact a prolific letter-writer and he once asked Horace to be his personal secretary. Horace refused the secretarial role but complied with the emperor's request for a verse letter.&lt;ref&gt;E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; The letter to Augustus may have been slow in coming, being published possibly as late as 11 BC. It celebrated, among other things, the 15 BC military victories of his stepsons, Drusus and Tiberius, yet it and the following letter&lt;ref&gt;''Epistles'' 2.2&lt;/ref&gt; were largely devoted to literary theory and criticism. The literary theme was explored still further in ''Ars Poetica'', published separately but written in the form of an epistle and sometimes referred to as ''Epistles'' 2.3 (possibly the last poem he ever wrote).&lt;ref&gt;R. Ferri, ''The Epistles'', 121&lt;/ref&gt; He was also commissioned to write odes commemorating the victories of Drusus and Tiberius&lt;ref&gt;''Odes'' 4.4 and 4.14&lt;/ref&gt; and one to be sung in a temple of Apollo for the [[Secular Games]], a long abandoned festival that Augustus revived in accordance with his policy of recreating ancient customs (''Carmen Saeculare'').

Suetonius recorded some gossip about Horace's sexual activities late in life, claiming that the walls of his bedchamber were covered with obscene pictures and mirrors, so that he saw erotica wherever he looked.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Suetonius signals that the report is based on rumours by employing the terms "traditur...dicitur" / "it is reported...it is said"  (E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 21)&lt;/ref&gt; The poet died at 56 years of age, not long after his friend Maecenas, near whose tomb he was laid to rest. Both men bequeathed their property to Augustus, an honour that the emperor expected of his friends.&lt;ref&gt;E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[Image:Horatius - Boek I Ode XIV - Cleveringaplaats 1, Leiden.JPG|thumb|''Odes'' 1.14 – [[Wall poems in Leiden|Wall poem in Leiden]] ]]

The dating of Horace's works isn't known precisely and scholars often debate the exact order in which they were first 'published'. There are persuasive arguments for the following chronology:&lt;ref&gt;R Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 17–21&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Satires (Horace)|Satires 1]]'' (c. 35–34 BC)
* ''[[Satires (Horace)|Satires 2]]'' (c. 30 BC)
* ''[[Epodes]]'' (30 BC)
* ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes 1–3]]'' (c. 23 BC)&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;According to a recent theory, the three books of ''Odes'' were issued separately, possibly in 26, 24 and 23 BC (see G. Hutchinson (2002), ''Classical Quarterly'' 52: 517–37)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Epistles (Horace)|Epistles 1]]'' (c. 21 BC)
* ''[[Carmen Saeculare]]'' (17 BC)
* ''[[Epistles (Horace)|Epistles 2]]'' (c. 11 BC)&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;19 BC is the usual estimate but c. 11 BC has good support too (see R. Nisbet, ''Horace: life and chronology'', 18–20&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes 4]]'' (c. 11 BC)
* ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (c. 10–8 BC)&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The date however is subject to much controversy with 22–18 BC another option (see for example R. Syme, ''The Augustan Aristocracy'', 379–81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical context===
Horace composed in traditional [[Meter (poetry)|metres]] borrowed from [[Archaic Greece]], employing [[hexameter]]s in his ''Satires'' and ''Epistles'', and [[iamb (poetry)|iambs]] in his ''Epodes'', all of which were relatively easy to adapt into [[Prosody (Latin)|Latin forms]]. His ''Odes'' featured more complex measures, including [[Alcaic verse|alcaics]] and [[Sapphic stanza|sapphics]], which were sometimes a difficult fit for Latin structure and [[syntax]]. Despite these traditional metres, he presented himself as a partisan in the development of a new and sophisticated style. He was influenced in particular by [[Hellenistic poetry|Hellenistic]] aesthetics of brevity, elegance and polish, as modeled in the work of [[Callimachus]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Harrison, ''Style and poetic texture'', 262&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|As soon as Horace, stirred by his own genius and encouraged by the example of Virgil, Varius, and perhaps some other poets of the same generation, had determined to make his fame as a poet, being by temperament a fighter, he wanted to fight against all kinds of prejudice, amateurish slovenliness, philistinism, reactionary tendencies, in short to fight for the new and noble type of poetry which he and his friends were endeavouring to bring about.|[[Eduard Fraenkel]]&lt;ref&gt;E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 124–5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In modern literary theory, a distinction is often made between immediate personal experience (''Urerlebnis'') and experience mediated by cultural vectors such as literature, philosophy and the visual arts (''Bildungserlebnis'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gundolf|first1=Friedrich|title=Goethe|date=1916|publisher=Bondi|location=Berlin, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction has little relevance for Horace{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} however since his personal and literary experiences are implicated in each other. ''Satires'' 1.5, for example, recounts in detail a real trip Horace made with Virgil and some of his other literary friends, and which parallels a Satire by [[Gaius Lucilius|Lucilius]], his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 106–7&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike much Hellenistic-inspired literature, however, his poetry was not composed for a small coterie of admirers and fellow poets, nor does it rely on abstruse allusions for many of its effects. Though elitist in its literary standards, it was written for a wide audience, as a public form of art.&lt;ref&gt;E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 74&lt;/ref&gt; Ambivalence also characterizes his literary persona, since his presentation of himself as part of a small community of philosophically aware people, seeking true peace of mind while shunning vices like greed, was well adapted to Augustus's plans to reform public morality, corrupted by greed{{spaced ndash}}his personal plea for moderation was part of the emperor's grand message to the nation.&lt;ref&gt;E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 95–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Horace generally followed the examples of poets established as classics in different genres, such as [[Archilochus]] in the ''Epodes'', Lucilius in the ''Satires'' and [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] in the ''Odes'', later broadening his scope for the sake of variation and because his models weren't actually suited to the realities confronting him. Archilochus and Alcaeus were aristocratic Greeks whose poetry had a social and religious function that was immediately intelligible to their audiences but which became a mere artifice or literary motif when transposed to Rome. However, the artifice of the ''Odes'' is also integral to their success, since they could now accommodate a wide range of emotional effects, and the blend of Greek and Roman elements adds a sense of detachment and universality.&lt;ref&gt;J. Griffin, ''Gods and Religion'', 182&lt;/ref&gt; Horace proudly claimed to introduce into Latin the spirit and iambic poetry of Archilochus but (unlike Archilochus) without persecuting anyone (''Epistles'' 1.19.23–5). It was no idle boast. His ''Epodes'' were modeled on the verses of the Greek poet, as 'blame poetry', yet he avoided targeting real [[scapegoat]]s. Whereas Archilochus presented himself as a serious and vigorous opponent of wrong-doers, Horace aimed for comic effects and adopted the persona of a weak and ineffectual critic of his times (as symbolized for example in his surrender to the witch Canidia in the final epode).&lt;ref&gt;S. Harrison, ''Lyric and Iambic'', 192&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed to be the first to introduce into Latin the lyrical methods of Alcaeus (''Epistles'' 1.19.32–3) and he actually was the first Latin poet to make consistent use of Alcaic meters and themes: love, politics and the [[symposium]]. He imitated other Greek lyric poets as well, employing a 'motto' technique, beginning each ode with some reference to a Greek original and then diverging from it.&lt;ref&gt;S. Harrison, ''Lyric and Iambic'', 194–6&lt;/ref&gt;

The satirical poet Lucilius was a senator's son who could castigate his peers with impunity. Horace was a mere freedman's son who had to tread carefully.&lt;ref name="E. Fraenkel, Horace, 32, 80"&gt;E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', 32, 80&lt;/ref&gt; Lucilius was a rugged patriot and a significant voice in Roman self-awareness, endearing himself to his countrymen by his blunt frankness and explicit politics. His work expressed genuine freedom or [[libertas]]. His style included  'metrical vandalism'  and looseness of structure. Horace instead adopted an oblique and ironic style of satire, ridiculing stock characters and anonymous targets. His libertas was the private freedom of a philosophical outlook, not a political or social privilege.&lt;ref&gt;L. Morgan, ''Satire'', 177–8&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Satires'' are relatively easy-going in their use of meter (relative to the tight lyric meters of the ''Odes'')&lt;ref&gt;S. Harrison, ''Style and poetic texture'', 271&lt;/ref&gt; but formal and highly controlled relative to the poems of Lucilius, whom Horace mocked for his sloppy standards (''Satires'' 1.10.56–61)&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;"[Lucilius]...resembles a man whose only concern is to force / something into the framework of six feet, and who gaily produces / two hundred lines before dinner and another two hundred after."{{spaced ndash}}''Satire'' 1.10.59–61 (translated by [[Niall Rudd]], ''The Satires of Horace and Persius'', Penguin Classics 1973, p 69)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Epistles'' may be considered among Horace's most innovative works. There was nothing like it in Greek or Roman literature. Occasionally  poems had had some resemblance to letters, including an elegiac poem from [[Solon]] to [[Mimnermus]] and some lyrical poems from [[Pindar]] to [[Hieron of Syracuse]]. Lucilius had composed a satire in the form of a letter, and some epistolary poems were composed by [[Catullus]] and [[Propertius]]. But nobody before Horace had ever composed an entire collection of verse letters,&lt;ref&gt;R. Ferri, ''The Epistles'', p.121-22&lt;/ref&gt; let alone letters with a focus on philosophical problems. The sophisticated and flexible style that he had developed in his ''Satires'' was adapted to the more serious needs of this new genre.&lt;ref&gt;E. Fraenkel, ''Horace'', p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; Such refinement of style was not unusual for Horace. His craftsmanship as a wordsmith is apparent even in his earliest attempts at this or that kind of poetry, but his handling of each genre tended to improve over time as he adapted it to his own needs.&lt;ref name="E. Fraenkel, Horace, 32, 80"/&gt; Thus for example it is generally agreed that his second book of ''Satires'', where human folly is revealed through dialogue between characters, is superior to the first, where he propounds his ethics in monologues. Nevertheless, the first book includes some of his most popular poems.&lt;ref&gt;V. Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Themes===
Horace developed a number of inter-related themes throughout his poetic career, including politics, love, philosophy and ethics, his own social role, as well as poetry itself. His ''Epodes'' and ''Satires'' are forms of 'blame poetry' and both have a natural affinity with the moralising and diatribes of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]]. This often takes the form of allusions to the work and philosophy of [[Bion of Borysthenes]] &lt;ref group="nb"&gt;There is one reference to Bion by name in ''Epistles'' 2.2.60, and the clearest allusion to him is in ''Satire'' 1.6, which parallels Bion fragments 1, 2, 16 ''Kindstrand''&lt;/ref&gt; but it is as much a literary game as a philosophical alignment. By the time he composed his ''Epistles'', he was a critic of Cynicism along with all impractical and "high-falutin" philosophy in general.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;''Epistles'' 1.17 and 1.18.6–8 are critical of the extreme views of [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]] and also of social adaptations of Cynic precepts, and yet ''Epistle'' 1.2 could be either Cynic or Stoic in its orientation (J. Moles, ''Philosophy and ethics'', p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Moles, ''Philosophy and ethics'', p. 165-69, 177&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Satires'' also include a strong element of [[Epicureanism]], with frequent allusions to the Epicurean poet [[Lucretius]].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;''Satires'' 1.1.25–26, 74–5, 1.2.111–12, 1.3.76–7, 97–114, 1.5.44, 101–3, 1.6.128–31, 2.2.14–20, 25, 2.6.93–7&lt;/ref&gt; So for example the Epicurean sentiment ''[[carpe diem]]'' is the inspiration behind Horace's repeated punning on his own name (''Horatius ~ hora'') in ''Satires'' 2.6.&lt;ref&gt;K. J. Reckford, ''Some studies in Horace's odes on love''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Satires'' also feature some [[Stoicism|Stoic]], [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]] and [[Platonic Dialogues|Platonic]] (''Dialogues'') elements. In short, the ''Satires'' present a medley of philosophical programs, dished up in no particular order{{spaced ndash}}a style of argument typical of the [[Satires (Horace)|genre]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Moles, ''Philosophy and ethics'', p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Odes'' display a wide range of topics. Over time, he becomes more confident about his political voice.&lt;ref&gt;Santirocco "Unity and Design", Lowrie "Horace's Narrative Odes"&lt;/ref&gt; Although he is often thought of as an overly intellectual lover, he is ingenuous in representing passion.&lt;ref&gt;Ancona, "Time and the Erotic"&lt;/ref&gt; The "Odes" weave various philosophical strands together, with allusions and statements of doctrine present in about a third of the ''Odes'' Books 1–3, ranging from the flippant (1.22, 3.28) to the solemn (2.10, 3.2, 3.3). Epicureanism is the dominant influence, characterizing about twice as many of these odes as Stoicism. A group of odes combines these two influences in tense relationships, such as ''Odes'' 1.7, praising Stoic virility and devotion to public duty while also advocating private pleasures among friends. While generally favouring the Epicurean lifestyle, the lyric poet is as eclectic as the satiric poet, and in ''Odes'' 2.10 even proposes Aristotle's [[golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]] as a remedy for Rome's political troubles.&lt;ref&gt;J. Moles, ''Philosophy and ethics'', p. 171-73&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Horace's poems also contain much reflection on genre, the lyric tradition, and the function of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Davis "Polyhymnia" and Lowrie "Horace's Narrative Odes"&lt;/ref&gt; ''Odes'' 4, thought to be composed at the emperor's request, takes the themes of the first three books of "Odes" to a new level. This book shows greater poetic confidence after the public performance of his "Carmen saeculare" or "Century hymn" at a public festival orchestrated by Augustus. In it, Horace addresses the emperor Augustus directly with more confidence and proclaims his power to grant poetic immortality to those he praises. It is the least philosophical collection of his verses, excepting the twelfth ode, addressed to the dead Virgil as if he were living. In that ode, the epic poet and the lyric poet are aligned with Stoicism and Epicureanism respectively, in a mood of bitter-sweet pathos.&lt;ref&gt;J. Moles, ''Philosophy and ethics'', p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; The first poem of the ''Epistles'' sets the philosophical tone for the rest of the collection: "So now I put aside both verses and all those other games: What is true and what befits is my care, this my question, this my whole concern." His poetic renunciation of poetry in favour of philosophy is intended to be ambiguous. Ambiguity is the hallmark of the ''Epistles''. It is uncertain if those being addressed by the self-mocking poet-philosopher are being honoured or criticized. Though he emerges as an Epicurean, it is on the understanding that philosophical preferences, like political and social choices, are a matter of personal taste. Thus he depicts the ups and downs of the philosophical life more realistically than do most philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;J. Moles, ''Philosophy and ethics'', p. 174-80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Quinto Orazio Flacco.jpg|thumb|Horace, portrayed by [[Giacomo Di Chirico]]]]

The reception of Horace's work has varied from one epoch to another and varied markedly even in his own lifetime. ''Odes'' 1–3 were not well received when first 'published' in Rome, yet Augustus later commissioned a ceremonial ode for the Centennial Games in 17 BC and also encouraged the publication of ''Odes'' 4, after which Horace's reputation as Rome's premier lyricist was assured. His Odes were to become the best received of all his poems in ancient times, acquiring a classic status that discouraged imitation: no other poet produced a comparable body of lyrics in the four centuries that followed&lt;ref&gt;R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 279&lt;/ref&gt; (though that might also be attributed to social causes, particularly the parasitism that Italy was sinking into).&lt;ref&gt;V. Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', 176&lt;/ref&gt; In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, ode-writing became highly fashionable in England and a large number of aspiring poets imitated Horace both in English and in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;D. Money, ''The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'', 326, 332&lt;/ref&gt;

In a verse epistle to Augustus (Epistle 2.1), in 12 BC, Horace argued for classic status to be awarded to contemporary poets, including Virgil and apparently himself.&lt;ref&gt;R. Lyme, ''Augustan Poetry and Society'', 603&lt;/ref&gt; In the final poem of his third book of Odes he claimed to have created for himself a monument more durable than bronze ("Exegi monumentum aere perennius", ''[[Carmina]]'' 3.30.1). For one modern scholar, however, Horace's personal qualities are more notable than the monumental quality of his achievement:
{{quote|...when we hear his name we don't really think of a monument. We think rather of a voice which varies in tone and resonance but is always recognizable, and which by its unsentimental humanity evokes a very special blend of liking and respect.|[[Niall Rudd]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Niall Rudd]], ''The Satires of Horace and Persius'', 14&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yet for men like [[Wilfred Owen]], scarred by experiences of World War I, his poetry stood for discredited values:

{{poemquote|
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest
To children ardent for some desperate glory,
The Old Lie: Dulce et decorum est
Pro patria mori.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Wilfred Owen, ''[[Dulce et decorum est]]'' (1917), echoes a line from ''Carmina'' 3.2.13, "it is sweet and honourable to die for one's country", cited by Stephen Harrison, ''The nineteenth and twentieth centuries'', 340.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

The same motto, ''[[Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori]]'', had been adapted to the ethos of martyrdom in the lyrics of early Christian poets like [[Prudentius]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 282–3&lt;/ref&gt;

These preliminary comments touch on a small sample of developments in the reception of Horace's work. More developments are covered epoch by epoch in the following sections.

===Antiquity===
Horace's influence can be observed in the work of his near contemporaries, [[Ovid]] and [[Propertius]]. Ovid followed his example in creating a completely natural style of expression in hexameter verse, and Propertius cheekily mimicked him in his third book of elegies.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Propertius published his third book of elegies within a year or two of Horace's Odes 1–3 and mimicked him, for example, in the opening lines, characterizing himself in terms borrowed from Odes 3.1.13 and 3.30.13–14, as a priest of the Muses and as an adaptor of Greek forms of poetry (R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 227)&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Epistles'' provided them both with a model for their own verse letters and it also shaped Ovid's exile poetry.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Ovid for example probably borrowed from Horace's ''Epistle'' 1.20 the image of a poetry book as a slave boy eager to leave home, adapting it to the opening poems of ''Tristia'' 1 and 3 (R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace''), and ''Tristia'' 2 may be understood as a counterpart to Horace's ''Epistles'' 2.1, both being letters addressed to Augustus on literary themes (A. Barchiesi, ''Speaking Volumes'', 79–103)&lt;/ref&gt;

His influence had a perverse aspect. As mentioned before, the brilliance of his ''Odes'' may have discouraged imitation. Conversely, they may have created a vogue for the lyrics of the archaic Greek poet [[Pindar]], due to the fact that Horace had neglected that style of lyric (see [[Pindar#Influence and legacy]]).&lt;ref&gt;R. Tarrant, Ancient receptions of Horace, 280&lt;/ref&gt; The iambic genre seems almost to have disappeared after publication of Horace's ''Epodes''. Ovid's ''Ibis'' was a rare attempt at the form but it was inspired mainly by [[Callimachus]], and there are some iambic elements in [[Martial]] but the main influence there was [[Catullus]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 278&lt;/ref&gt; A revival of popular interest in the satires of Lucilius may have been inspired by Horace's criticism of his unpolished style. Both Horace and Lucilius were considered good role-models by [[Persius]], who critiqued his own satires as lacking both the acerbity of Lucillius and the gentler touch of Horace.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The comment is in Persius 1.114–18, yet that same satire has been found to have nearly 80 reminiscences of Horace; see D. Hooley, ''The Knotted Thong'', 29&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juvenal]]'s caustic satire was influenced mainly by Lucilius but Horace by then was a school classic and Juvenal could refer to him respectfully and in a round-about way as "''the Venusine lamp''".&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The allusion to ''Venusine'' comes via Horace's ''Sermones'' 2.1.35, while ''lamp'' signifies the lucubrations of a conscientious poet. According to Quintilian (93), however, many people in Flavian Rome preferred Lucilius not only to Horace but to all other Latin poets (R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 279)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Statius]] paid homage to Horace by composing one poem in Sapphic and one in Alcaic meter (the verse forms most often associated with ''Odes''), which he included in his collection of occasional poems, ''Silvae''. Ancient scholars wrote commentaries on the lyric meters of the ''Odes'', including the scholarly poet [[Caesius Bassus]]. By a process called ''derivatio'', he varied established meters through the addition or omission of syllables, a technique borrowed by [[Seneca the Younger]] when adapting Horatian meters to the stage.&lt;ref&gt;R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 280–81&lt;/ref&gt;

Horace's poems continued to be school texts into late antiquity. Works attributed to [[Helenius Acro]] and [[Pomponius Porphyrio]] are the remnants of a much larger body of Horatian scholarship. Porphyrio arranged the poems in non-chronological order, beginning with the ''Odes'', because of their general popularity and their appeal to scholars (the ''Odes'' were to retain this privileged position in the medieval manuscript tradition and thus in modern editions also). Horace was often evoked by poets of the fourth century, such as [[Ausonius]] and [[Claudian]]. [[Prudentius]] presented himself as a Christian Horace, adapting Horatian meters to his own poetry and giving Horatian motifs a Christian tone.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Prudentius sometimes alludesto the ''Odes'' in a negative context, as expressions of a secular life he is abandoning. Thus for example ''male pertinax'', employed in Prudentius's ''Praefatio'' to describe a wilful desire for victory, is lifted from ''Odes'' 1.9.24, where it describes a girl's half-hearted resistance to seduction. Elsewhere he borrows ''dux bone'' from ''Odes'' 4.5.5 and 37, where it refers to Augustus, and applies it to Christ (R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 282&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[St Jerome]], modelled an uncompromising response to the pagan Horace, observing: "''What harmony can there be between Christ and the Devil? What has Horace to do with the Psalter?''"&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;St Jerome, ''Epistles'' 22.29, incorporating a quote from ''2 'Corinthians'' 6.14: ''qui consensus Christo et Belial? quid facit cum psalterio Horatius?''(cited by K. Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 292)&lt;/ref&gt; By the early sixth century, Horace and Prudentius were both part of a classical heritage that was struggling to survive the disorder of the times. [[Boethius]], the last major author of classical Latin literature, could still take inspiration from Horace, sometimes mediated by Senecan tragedy.&lt;ref name="Tarrant"&gt;R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 283&lt;/ref&gt; It can be argued that Horace's influence extended beyond poetry to dignify core themes and values of the early Christian era, such as self-sufficiency, inner contentment and courage.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;''Odes'' 3.3.1–8 was especially influential in promoting the value of heroic calm in the face of danger, describing a man who could bear even the collapse of the world without fear (''si fractus illabatur orbis,/impavidum ferient ruinae''). Echoes are found in Seneca's ''Agamemnon'' 593–603, Prudentius's ''Peristephanon'' 4.5–12 and Boethius's ''Consolatio'' 1 metrum 4.(R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 283–85)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages and Renaissance===
[[File:Horaz beim Studium.jpg|thumb|Horace in his Studium: German print of the fifteenth century, summarizing the final [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber IV/Carmen XV|ode 4.15]] (in praise of Augustus).]]

Classical texts almost ceased being copied in the period between the mid sixth century and the [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian revival]]. Horace's work probably survived in just two or three books imported into northern Europe from Italy. These became the ancestors of six extant manuscripts dated to the ninth century. Two of those six manuscripts are French in origin, one was produced in [[Alsace]], and the other three show Irish influence but were probably written in continental monasteries ([[Lombardy]] for example).&lt;ref&gt;R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 285–87&lt;/ref&gt; By the last half of the ninth century, it was not uncommon for literate people to have direct experience of Horace's poetry. His influence on the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] can be found in the poems of [[Heiric of Auxerre]]&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Heiric, like Prudentius, gave Horatian motifs a Christian context. Thus the character Lydia in ''Odes'' 3.19.15, who would willingly die for her lover twice, becomes in Heiric's ''Life'' of St Germaine of Auxerre a saint ready to die twice for the Lord's commandments (R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 287–88)&lt;/ref&gt; and in some manuscripts marked with [[neumes]], mysterious notations that may have been an aid to the memorization and discussion of his lyric meters. ''Ode'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber IV/Carmen XI|4.11]] is neumed with the melody of a hymn to John the Baptist, ''[[Ut queant laxis]]'', composed in [[Sapphic stanza]]s. This hymn later became the basis of the [[solfege]] system (''Do, re, mi...''){{emdash}}an association with western music quite appropriate for a lyric poet like Horace, though the language of the hymn is mainly Prudentian.&lt;ref&gt;R. Tarrant, ''Ancient receptions of Horace'', 288–89&lt;/ref&gt; Lyons&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Lyons, Horace's Odes and the Mystery of Do-Re-Mi&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the melody in question was linked with Horace's Ode well before Guido d'Arezzo fitted [[Ut queant laxis]] to it.  However, the melody is unlikely to be a survivor from classical times, although Ovid&lt;ref&gt;Tristia, 4.10.49–50&lt;/ref&gt; testifies to Horace's use of the lyre while performing his Odes.

The German scholar, [[Ludwig Traube (palaeographer)|Ludwig Traube]], once dubbed the tenth and eleventh centuries ''The age of Horace'' (''aetas Horatiana''), and placed it between the ''aetas Vergiliana'' of the eighth and ninth centuries, and the ''aetas Ovidiana'' of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a distinction supposed to reflect the dominant classical Latin influences of those times. Such a distinction is over-schematized since Horace was a substantial influence in the ninth century as well. Traube had focused too much on Horace's ''Satires''.&lt;ref&gt;B. Bischoff, ''Living with the satirists'', 83–95&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all of Horace's work found favor in the Medieval period. In fact medieval scholars were also guilty of over-schematism, associating Horace's different genres with the different ages of man. A twelfth century scholar encapsulated the theory: "...Horace wrote four different kinds of poems on account of the four ages, the ''Odes'' for boys, the ''Ars Poetica'' for young men, the ''Satires'' for mature men, the ''Epistles'' for old and complete men."&lt;ref&gt;K. Friis-Jensen,''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 291&lt;/ref&gt; It was even thought that Horace had composed his works in the  order in which they had been placed by ancient scholars.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;According to a medieval French commentary on the ''Satires'': "...first he composed his lyrics, and in them, speaking to the young, as it were, he took as subject-matter love affairs and quarrels, banquets and drinking parties. Next he wrote his ''Epodes'', and in them composed invectives against men of a more advanced and more dishonourable age...He next wrote his book about the ''Ars Poetica'', and in that instructed men of his own profession to write well...Later he added his book of ''Satires'', in which he reproved those who had fallen a prey to various kinds of vices. Finally he finished his oeuvre with the ''Epistles'', and in them, following the method of a good farmer, he sowed the virtues where he had rooted out the vices." (cited by K. Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 294–302)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its naivety, the schematism involved an appreciation of Horace's works as a collection, the ''Ars Poetica'', ''Satires'' and ''Epistles'' appearing to find favour as well as the ''Odes''. The later Middle Ages however gave special significance to ''Satires'' and ''Epistles'', being considered Horace's mature works. [[Dante]] referred to Horace as ''Orazio satiro'', and he awarded him a privileged position in the first circle of Hell, with [[Homer]], Ovid and [[Lucan]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 293, 304&lt;/ref&gt;

Horace's popularity is revealed in the large number of quotes from all his works found in almost every genre of medieval literature, and also in the number of poets imitating him in [[Prosody (Latin)#Two rhythms|quantitative Latin meter]] . The most prolific imitator of his ''Odes'' was the Bavarian monk, [[Metellus of Tegernsee]], who dedicated his work to the patron saint of [[Tegernsee Abbey]],  [[Quirinus of Tegernsee|St Quirinus]], around the year 1170. He imitated all Horace's lyrical meters then followed these up with imitations of other meters used by Prudentius and Boethius, indicating that variety, as first modelled by Horace, was considered a fundamental aspect of the lyric genre. The content of his poems however  was restricted to simple piety.&lt;ref&gt;K. Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 296–8&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most successful imitators of ''Satires'' and ''Epistles'' was another Germanic author, calling himself [[Sextus Amarcius]], around 1100, who composed four books, the first two exemplifying vices, the second pair mainly virtues.&lt;ref&gt;K. Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 302&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Petrarch]] is a key figure in the imitation of Horace in accentual meters. His verse letters in Latin were modelled on the ''Epistles'' and he wrote a letter to Horace in the form of an ode. However he also borrowed from Horace when composing his Italian sonnets. One modern scholar has speculated that authors who imitated Horace in accentual rhythms (including stressed Latin and vernacular languages) may have considered their work a natural sequel to Horace's metrical variety.&lt;ref&gt;K. Friis-Jensen, ''Horace in the Middle Ages'', 299&lt;/ref&gt; In France, Horace and [[Pindar]] were the poetic models for a group of vernacular authors called the [[Pléiade]], including for example [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[Joachim du Bellay]]. [[Montaigne]] made constant and inventive use of Horatian quotes.&lt;ref&gt;Michael McGann, ''Horace in the Renaissance'', 306&lt;/ref&gt; The vernacular languages were dominant in Spain and Portugal in the sixteenth century, where Horace's influence is notable in the works of such authors as [[Garcilaso de la Vega (poet)|Garcilaso de la Vega]], [[Juan Boscán]] [[Sá de Miranda]], [[Antonio Ferreira]] and [[Fray Luis de León]], the latter for example writing odes on the Horatian theme ''beatus ille'' (''happy the man'').&lt;ref&gt;E. Rivers, ''Fray Luis de León: The Original Poems''&lt;/ref&gt; The sixteenth century in western Europe was also an age of translations (except in Germany, where Horace wasn't translated until well into the seventeenth century). The first English translator was [[Thomas Drant]], who placed translations of [[Jeremiah]] and Horace side by side in ''Medicinable Morall'', 1566. That was also the year that the Scot [[George Buchanan]] paraphrased the [[Psalms]] in a Horatian setting. [[Ben Jonson]] put Horace on the stage in 1601 in ''[[Poetaster]]'', along with other classical Latin authors, giving them all their own verses to speak in translation. Horace's part evinces the independent spirit, moral earnestness and critical insight that many readers look for in his poems.&lt;ref&gt;M. McGann, ''Horace in the Renaissance'', 306–7, 313–16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of Enlightenment===
During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, or the [[Age of Enlightenment]], neo-classical culture was pervasive. English literature in the middle of that period has been dubbed [[Augustan literature|Augustan]]. It is not always easy to distinguish Horace's influence during those centuries (the mixing of influences is shown for example in one poet's pseudonym, ''Horace Juvenal'').&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;'Horace Juvenal' was author of ''Modern manners: a poem'', 1793&lt;/ref&gt; However a measure of his influence can be found in the diversity of the people interested in his works, both among readers and authors.&lt;ref&gt;D. Money, ''The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'', 318, 331, 332&lt;/ref&gt;

New editions of his works were published almost yearly. There were three new editions in 1612 (two in [[Leiden]], one in [[Frankfurt]]) and again in 1699 ([[Utrecht]], [[Barcelona]], [[Cambridge]]). Cheap editions were plentiful and fine editions were also produced, including one whose entire text was engraved by [[John Pine]] in [[copperplate engraving|copperplate]]. The poet [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]] owned five editions of Horace's work and the physician [[James Douglas (physician)|James Douglas]] had five hundred books with Horace-related titles. Horace was often commended in periodicals such as [[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]], as a hallmark of good judgement, moderation and manliness, a focus for moralising.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;see for example ''Spectator'' '''312''', 27 Feb. 1712; '''548''', 28 Nov. 1712; '''618''', 10 Nov. 1714&lt;/ref&gt; His verses offered a fund of mottoes, such as ''[[simplex munditiis]]'', (elegance in simplicity) ''[[splendide mendax]]'' (nobly untruthful.), ''[[sapere aude]]'', ''[[nunc est bibendum]]'', ''[[carpe diem]]'' (the latter perhaps being the only one still in common use today),&lt;ref name="Tarrant"/&gt; quoted even in works as prosaic as [[Edmund Quincy (1703-1788)|Edmund Quincy]]'s ''A treatise of hemp-husbandry'' (1765). The fictional hero [[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]] recited his verses with feeling.&lt;ref&gt;D. Money, ''The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'', 322&lt;/ref&gt; His works were also used to justify commonplace themes, such as patriotic obedience, as in James Parry's English lines from an Oxford University collection in 1736:&lt;ref&gt;D. Money, ''The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'', 326–7&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|

Horatian-style lyrics were increasingly typical of Oxford and Cambridge verse collections for this period, most of them in Latin but some like the previous ode in English. [[John Milton]]'s [[Lycidas]] first appeared in such a collection. It has few Horatian echoes&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;One echo of Horace may be found in line 69: "''Were it not better done as others use,/ To sport with Amaryllis in the shade/Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair?''", which points to the Neara in ''Odes'' 3.14.21 (Douglas Bush, ''Milton: Poetical Works'', 144, note 69)&lt;/ref&gt; yet Milton's associations with Horace were lifelong. He composed a controversial version of ''Odes'' 1.5, and [[Paradise Lost]] includes references to Horace's 'Roman' ''Odes'' 3.1–6 (Book 7 for example begins with echoes of ''Odes'' 3.4).&lt;ref&gt;J. Talbot, ''A Horatian Pun in Paradise Lost'', 21–3&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Horace's lyrics could offer inspiration to libertines as well as moralists, and neo-Latin sometimes served as a kind of discrete veil for the risqué. Thus for example [[Benjamin Loveling]] authored a catalogue of Drury Lane and Covent Garden prostitutes, in Sapphic stanzas, and an encomium for a dying lady "of salacious memory".&lt;ref&gt;B. Loveling, ''Latin and English Poems'', 49–52, 79–83&lt;/ref&gt; Some Latin imitations of Horace were politically subversive, such as a marriage ode by [[Anthony Alsop]] that included a rallying cry for the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause. On the other hand, [[Andrew Marvell]] took inspiration from Horace's ''Odes'' 1.37 to compose his English masterpiece [[Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland]], in which subtly nuanced reflections on the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] echo Horace's ambiguous response to the death of [[Cleopatra]] (Marvell's ode was suppressed in spite of its subtlety and only began to be widely published in 1776). [[Samuel Johnson]] took particular pleasure in reading ''The Odes''.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Cfr. [[James Boswell]], "The Life of [[Samuel Johnson]]" ''Aetat.'' 20, 1729 where Boswell remarked of Johnson that Horace's ''Odes'' "were the compositions in which he took most delight."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Pope]] wrote direct ''Imitations'' of Horace (published with the original Latin alongside) and also echoed him in ''Essays'' and  [[The Rape of the Lock]]. He even emerged as "a quite Horatian Homer" in his translation of the ''[[Iliad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;D. Money, ''The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'', 329–31&lt;/ref&gt; Horace appealed also to female poets, such as [[Anna Seward]] (''Original sonnets on various subjects, and odes paraphrased from Horace'', 1799) and [[Elizabeth Tollet]],  who composed a Latin ode in Sapphic meter to celebrate her brother's return from overseas, with tea and coffee substituted for the wine of Horace's [[symposium|sympotic]] settings:
{{verse translation|lang=la
|
Quos procax nobis numeros, jocosque

Temperent baccis Arabes, vel herbis
Pocula Seres&lt;ref&gt;E. Tollet, ''Poems on Several Occasions'', 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Muse dictate? while for you and me
Arabs flavour our cups with beans
Or Chinese with leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Translation adapted from D. Money, ''The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'', 329&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Horace's ''Ars Poetica'' is second only to Aristotle's ''Poetics'' in its influence on literary theory and criticism. Milton recommended both works in his treatise ''of Education''.&lt;ref&gt;A. Gilbert, ''Literary Criticism: Plato to Dryden'', 124, 669&lt;/ref&gt; Horace's ''Satires'' and ''Epistles'' however also had a huge impact, influencing theorists and critics such as [[John Dryden]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Kupersmith, ''Roman Satirists in Seventeenth Century England'', 97–101&lt;/ref&gt; There was considerable debate over the value of different lyrical forms for contemporary poets, as represented on one hand by the kind of four-line stanzas made familiar by Horace's Sapphic and Alcaic ''Odes'' and, on the other, the loosely structured [[Pindarics]] associated with the odes of [[Pindar]]. Translations occasionally involved scholars in the dilemmas of censorship. Thus [[Christopher Smart]] entirely omitted ''Odes'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber IV/Carmen X|4.10]] and re-numbered the remaining odes. He also removed the ending of ''Odes'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber IV/Carmen I|4.1]]. [[Thomas Creech]] printed ''Epodes'' [[:wikisource:la:Epodi#VIII|8]] and [[:wikisource:la:Epodi#XII|12]] in the original Latin but left out their English translations. [[Philip Francis (translator)|Philip Francis]] left out both the English and Latin for those same two epodes, a gap in the numbering  the only indication that something was amiss. French editions of Horace were influential in England and these too were regularly [[bowdlerize]]d.

Most European nations had their own 'Horaces': thus for example [[Friedrich von Hagedorn]] was called ''The German Horace'' and [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] ''The Polish Horace'' (the latter was much imitated by English poets such as [[Henry Vaughan]] and [[Abraham Cowley]]). Pope [[Urban VIII]] wrote voluminously in Horatian meters, including an ode on gout.&lt;ref&gt;D. Money, ''The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'', 319–25&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century on===

Horace maintained a central role in the education of English-speaking elites right up until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;S. Harrison, ''The nineteenth and twentieth centuries'', 340&lt;/ref&gt; A pedantic emphasis on the formal aspects of language-learning at the expense of literary appreciation may have made him unpopular in some quarters&lt;ref&gt;V. Kiernan, ''Horace: Poetics and Politics'', x&lt;/ref&gt; yet it also confirmed his influence{{emdash}}a tension in his reception that underlies [[Byron]]'s famous lines from ''[[Childe Harold]]'' (Canto iv, 77):&lt;ref&gt;S. Harrison, ''The nineteenth and twentieth centuries'', 334&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|
Then farewell, Horace, whom I hated so
Not for thy faults, but mine; it is a curse
To understand, not feel thy lyric flow,
To comprehend, but never love thy verse.
}}

[[William Wordsworth]]'s mature poetry, including the preface to [[Lyrical Ballads]], reveals Horace's influence in its rejection of false ornament&lt;ref&gt;D. Money, ''The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries'', 323&lt;/ref&gt; and he once expressed "a wish / to meet the shade of Horace...".&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The quote, from ''Memorials of a Tour of Italy'' (1837), contains allusions to ''Odes'' 3.4 and 3.13 (S. Harrison, ''The nineteenth and twentieth centuries'', 334–35)&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Keats]] echoed the opening of Horace's ''Epodes'' 14 in the opening lines of ''[[Ode to a Nightingale]]''.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;"''My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains / my sense...''" echoes Epodes'' [[:wikisource:la:Epodi#XIV|14.1–4]] (S. Harrison, ''The nineteenth and twentieth centuries'', 335)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman poet was presented in the nineteenth century as an honorary English gentleman. [[William Makepeace Thackeray|William Thackeray]] produced a version of ''Odes'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber I/Carmen XXXVIII|1.38]] in which Horace's questionable 'boy' became 'Lucy', and [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] translated the boy innocently as 'child'. Horace was translated by [[Sir Theodore Martin]] (biographer of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]) but minus some ungentlemanly verses, such as the erotic ''Odes'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber I/Carmen XXV|1.25]] and ''Epodes'' 8 and 12. [[Lord Lytton]] produced a popular translation and [[William Gladstone]] also wrote translations during his last days as Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;S. Harrison, ''The nineteenth and twentieth centuries'', 335–37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]'s ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]'', though formally derived from the Persian ''[[ruba'i]]'', nevertheless shows a strong Horatian influence, since, as one modern scholar has observed,"''...the quatrains inevitably recall the stanzas of the 'Odes', as does the narrating first person of the world-weary, ageing [[Epicurus|Epicurean]] Omar himself, mixing [[Symposium|sympotic]] exhortation and 'carpe diem' with splendid moralising and 'memento mori' [[nihilism]].''"&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Comment by S. Harrison, editor and contributor to ''The Cambridge Companion to Horace'' (S. Harrison, ''The nineteenth and twentieth centuries'', 337&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew Arnold]] advised a friend in verse not to worry about politics, an echo of ''Odes'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber II/Carmen XI|2.11]], yet later became a critic of Horace's inadequacies relative to Greek poets, as role models of [[Victorian Age|Victorian]] virtues, observing: "''If human life were complete without faith, without enthusiasm, without energy, Horace...would be the perfect interpreter of human life.''"&lt;ref&gt;M. Arnold, ''Selected Prose'', 74&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christina Rossetti]] composed a sonnet depicting a woman willing her own death steadily, drawing on Horace's depiction of 'Glycera' in ''Odes'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber I/Carmen XIX|1.19.5–6]] and Cleopatra in ''Odes'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber I/Carmen XXXVII|1.37]].&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Rossetti's sonnet, ''A Study (a soul)'', dated 1854, was not published in her own lifetime. Some lines: ''She stands as pale as Parian marble stands / Like Cleopatra when she turns at bay...'' (C. Rossetti, ''Complete Poems'', 758&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. E. Housman]] considered ''Odes'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber IV/Carmen VII|4.7]], in [[Prosody (Latin)#First Archilochian|Archilochian]] couplets, the most beautiful poem of antiquity&lt;ref&gt;W. Flesch, ''Companion to British Poetry, 19th Century'', 98&lt;/ref&gt; and yet he generally shared Horace's penchant for quatrains, being readily adapted to his own elegiac and melancholy strain.&lt;ref&gt;S. Harrison, ''The nineteenth and twentieth centuries'', 339&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous poem of [[Ernest Dowson]] took its title and its heroine's name from a line of ''Odes'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber IV/Carmen I|4.1]], ''Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae'', as well as its motif of nostalgia for a former flame. [[Kipling]] wrote a famous [[parody]] of the ''Odes'', satirising their stylistic idiosyncrasies and especially the extraordinary syntax, but he also used Horace's Roman patriotism as a focus for British imperialism, as in the story ''Regulus'' in the school collection ''[[Stalky &amp; Co.]]'', which he based on ''Odes'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber III/Carmen V|3.5]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Medcalfe, ''Kipling's Horace'', 217–39&lt;/ref&gt; Wilfred Owen's famous poem, quoted above, incorporated Horatian text to question patriotism while ignoring the rules of Latin scansion. However, there were few other echoes of Horace in the war period, possibly because war is not actually a major theme of Horace's work.&lt;ref&gt;S. Harrison, ''the nineteenth and twentieth centuries'', 340&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michelin Poster 1898.jpg|thumb|[[Bibendum]] (the symbol of the [[Michelin]] tyre company) takes his name from the opening line of [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber I/Carmen XXXVII|Ode 1.37]], ''[[Nunc est bibendum]]''.]]
Both [[W.H.Auden]] and [[Louis MacNeice]] began their careers as teachers of classics and both responded as poets to Horace's influence. Auden for example evoked the fragile world of the 1930s in terms echoing ''Odes'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber II/Carmen XI|2.11.1–4]], where Horace advises a friend not to let worries about frontier wars interfere with current pleasures.

{{poemquote|

Nor ask what doubtful act allows

}}

The American poet, [[Robert Frost]], echoed Horace's ''Satires'' in the conversational and sententious idiom of some of his longer poems, such as ''The Lesson for Today'' (1941), and also in his gentle advocacy of life on the farm, as in ''Hyla Brook'' (1916), evoking Horace's ''fons Bandusiae'' in ''Ode'' [[:wikisource:la:Carmina (Horatius)/Liber III/Carmen XIII|3.13]].  Now at the start of the third millennium, poets are still absorbing and re-configuring the Horatian influence, sometimes in translation (such as a 2002 English/American edition of the ''Odes'' by thirty-six poets)&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Edited by McClatchy, reviewed by S. Harrison, ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' 2003.03.05&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes as inspiration for their own work (such as a 2003 collection of odes by a New Zealand poet).&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;I. Wedde, ''The Commonplace Odes'', Auckland 2003, (cited by S. Harrison, ''The nineteenth and twentieth centuries'', 345)&lt;/ref&gt;

Horace's ''Epodes'' have largely been ignored in the modern era, excepting those with political associations of historical significance. The obscene qualities of some of the poems have repulsed even scholars&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;'Political' Epodes are 1, 7, 9, 16; notably obscene Epodes are 8 and 12. E. Fraenkel is among the admirers repulsed by these two poems, for another view of which see for example Dee Lesser Clayman, 'Horace's Epodes VIII and XII: More than Clever Obscenity?', ''The Classical World'' Vol. 6, No. 1 (September 1975), pp 55–61 {{JSTOR|4348329}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet more recently a better understanding of the nature of [[Iambus (genre)|Iambic poetry]] has led to a re-evaluation of the ''whole'' collection.&lt;ref&gt;D. Mankin, ''Horace: Epodes'', 6–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. McNeill, ''Horace'', 12&lt;/ref&gt; A re-appraisal of the ''Epodes'' also appears in creative adaptations by recent poets (such as a 2004 collection of poems that relocates the ancient context to a 1950s industrial town).&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;M. Almond, ''The Works'' 2004, Washington, cited by S. Harrison, ''The nineteenth and twentieth centuries'', 346&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Islam}}
{{Feminism sidebar |Variants (religious)}}
A combination of [[Islam]] and [[feminism]] has been advocated as "a feminist discourse and practice articulated within an Islamic paradigm" by Margot Badran in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/cu1.htm Al-Ahram Weekly | Culture | Islamic feminism: what's in a name?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320074746/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/cu1.htm |date=March 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic feminists ground their arguments in Islam and its teachings,&lt;ref name="milligazette.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ias.org/sufism/women-in-islam/|title=Women In Islam|last=|first=|date=|work=milligazette.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; seek the full equality of women and men in the personal and public sphere, and can include non-Muslims in the discourse and debate. '''Islamic feminism''' is defined by [[Islamic scholars]] as being more radical than secular feminism &lt;ref name="weekly.ahram.org.eg"&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/cu1.htm "Islamic feminism: what's in a name?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320074746/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/569/cu1.htm |date=2015-03-20 }} by Margot Badran, ''Al-Ahram'', January 17–23, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; {{dead link|date=July 2018}} and as being anchored within the [[discourse]] of Islam with the Quran as its central text.&lt;ref name="Exploring Islamic Feminism"&gt;[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1426&amp;fuseaction=topics.event_summary&amp;event_id=42775 "Exploring Islamic Feminism"] by Margot Badran, Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding, Georgetown University, November 30, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; 
As a "school of thought", it is said to refer to Moroccan sociologist "[[Fatema Mernissi]] and scholars such as [[Amina Wadud]] and [[Leila Ahmed]]".&lt;ref name="Lindsey-NYT-2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lindsey|first1=Ursula|title=Can Muslim Feminism Find a Third Way?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/opinion/islam-feminism-third-way.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=opinion-c-col-right-region&amp;region=opinion-c-col-right-region&amp;WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region|accessdate=11 April 2018|publisher=New York Times|date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates refer to the observation that [[Muslim majority countries]] produced several female heads of state, prime ministers, and state secretaries such as [[Lala Shovkat]] of [[Islam in Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]], [[Benazir Bhutto]] of [[Islam in Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Mame Madior Boye]] of [[Islam in Senegal|Senegal]], [[Tansu Çiller]] of [[Islam in Turkey|Turkey]], [[Kaqusha Jashari]] of [[Islam in Kosovo|Kosovo]], and [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]] of [[Islam in Indonesia|Indonesia]]. In [[Bangladesh]], [[Khaleda Zia]] was elected the country's first female prime minister in 1991, and served as prime minister until 2009, when she was replaced by [[Sheikh Hasina]], who maintains the prime minister's office at present making Bangladesh the country with the longest continuous female premiership .&lt;ref name="The Economist"&gt;"Prime Minister of Bangladesh - PM Office Email Address."

==Definitions==
There are substantial differences to be noted between the terms 'Islamic feminist' and 'Islamist'. Any of these terms can be used of men or women.

===Islamic feminists===
Islamic feminists interpret the religious texts in a feminist perspective. They can be viewed as a branch of interpreters who ground their arguments in Islam and its teachings,&lt;ref name="milligazette.com"/&gt; seek the full equality of women and men in the personal and public sphere, and can include non-Muslims in the discourse and debate.

Islamic feminism is defined by [[Islamic scholars]] as being more radical than secular [[feminism]],&lt;ref name="weekly.ahram.org.eg"/&gt; and as being anchored within the [[discourse]] of Islam with the Quran as its central text.&lt;ref name="Exploring Islamic Feminism"/&gt;

During recent times, the concept of Islamic feminism has grown further with Islamic groups looking to garner support from many aspects of society. In addition, educated Muslim women are striving to articulate their role in society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monitor.upeace.org/innerpg.cfm?id_article=789] Rob L. Wagner: "Saudi-Islamic Feminist Movement: A Struggle for Male Allies and the Right Female Voice", University for Peace (Peace and Conflict Monitor), March 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamists===
[[Islamists]] are advocates of [[Political aspects of Islam|political Islam]], the notion that the Quran and hadith mandate a [[caliphate]], i.e. an Islamic government. Some Islamists advocate women's rights in the [[public sphere]] but do not challenge [[gender inequality]] in the personal, [[private sphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-bulletin.org/women/Islamic_feminism_IB.html|title=ISLAMIC FEMINISM AND THE POLITICS OF NAMING|work=iran-bulletin.org|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Su'ad al-Fatih al-Badawi]], a Sudanese academic and Islamist politician, has argued that feminism is incompatible with ''[[taqwa]]'' (the Islamic conception of piety), and thus Islam and feminism are mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hale|first=Sondra|chapter=Sudanese Women in National Service, Militias &amp; the Home|date=2013|editor1-last=Doumato |editor1-first=Eleanor|editor2-last=Posusney |editor2-first=Marsha|title= Women and Globalization in the Arab Middle East: Gender, Economy, and Society |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xq0WKr_yFCYC|publisher= Lynne Rienner |pages=208|isbn= 1588261344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margot Badran of Georgetown University’s Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding argues that Islam and feminism are not mutually exclusive and that “Islamic feminism, which derives its understanding and mandate from the Qur'an, seeks rights and justice for women, and for men, in the totality of their existence. Islamic feminism is both highly contested and firmly embraced.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/shadya/muslimfeminism.html|title=Independent Lens . SHADYA .

== History ==

===Early changes under Islam===
{{main|Early social changes under Islam}}
During the [[Muslim history|early days of Islam]] in the 7th century [[Common Era|CE]], changes in [[women's rights]] affected marriage, divorce and inheritance.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2510?_hi=6&amp;_pos=2 |title="Women and Islam" in '&amp;#39;Oxford Islamic Studies Online'&amp;#39; |doi=10.1093/0198297688.003.0006 |publisher=Oxfordislamicstudies.com |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Oxford Dictionary of Islam'' argues for a general improvement of the status of [[women in Arab societies]], including the prohibition of [[female infanticide]], though some historians believe that infanticide was practiced both before and after Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Giladi |first1=Avner |date=May 1990 |title=Some Observations on Infanticide In Medieval Muslim Society |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-middle-east-studies/article/some-observations-on-infanticide-in-medieval-muslim-society/86D513169DFCB1A85F2D921A63AACC5B |journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies |volume=22 | issue=2 |pages=185-200 |access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a status but rather as a contract, in which the woman's consent was imperative, either by active consent or silence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/bukhari/67/73 |title=Sahih al-Bukhari » Book of Wedlock, Marriage (Nikaah) |accessdate=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name="majid"/&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;ref name="OxfordDicT"&gt;Esposito, John L. ''Islam: The Straight Path''. New York: Oxford UP, 1998. N. page 339. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=March 2016}} "The [[dowry]], previously regarded as a [[bride price|bride-price]] paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property"&lt;ref name="majid"&gt;Khadduri, Majid. ''Socialist Iraq: A Study in Iraqi Politics since 1968''. Washington: Middle East Institute, 1978. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;ref name="Espos"&gt;Esposito, John L. ''Islam: The Straight Path''. New York: Oxford UP, 1998. Print&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=March 2016}} (see also [[Dower]]).

[[William Montgomery Watt]] states that Muhammad, in the historical context of his time, can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of women's rights and improved things considerably. Watt explains: "At the time Islam began, the conditions of women were terrible&amp;nbsp;– they had no right to own [[property]], were supposed to be [[Personal property|the property of the man]], and if the man died everything went to his sons." Muhammad, however, by "instituting rights of property ownership, inheritance, education and divorce, gave women certain basic safeguards."&lt;ref&gt;Watt, W. Montgomery. ''Islamic Creeds: A Selection''. Edinburgh: Edinburgh UP, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=March 2016}} Haddad and [[John Esposito|Esposito]] state that "Muhammad granted women rights and privileges in the sphere of family life, marriage, education, and economic endeavors, rights that help improve women's status in society."&lt;ref name="Espos" /&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Feminist critics of the notion that Islam significantly bettered the status of women include [[Leila Ahmed]], who states that Islamic records show that at least some women in pre-Islamic Arabia inherited wealth, ran businesses, chose their own husbands, and worked in respected professions.&lt;ref name="ahmed"&gt;[[Leila Ahmed]], ''Women and the Advent of Islam'', Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society, Vol. 11, No. 4, pp. 665-691&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fatima Mernissi]] similarly argues that customs in pre-Islamic Arabia were more permissive of female sexuality and social independence, not less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mernissi | first=Fatima | title=Beyond the Veil: Male-female Dynamics in Modern Muslim Society | year=1975 | publisher=Saqi Books | isbn=9780863564413 | page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mahood A, Moel J, Hudson C, and Leathers L. conducted a study and questioned individual women about how their role as a woman in their religion and if it empowering them in any way, an interviewee states "In Islam and its teachings are capable of giving women an equal footing in society to men, and that Islam does not relegate women to the private sphere. I really believe some Muslims have distorted our teachings and forgotten our heritage. I believe that Islam can be used as a source of empowerment for women.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/islam-and-feminism-are-not-mutually-exclusive-and-faith-can-be-an-important-liberator-77086|title=Islam and feminism are not mutually exclusive, and faith can be an important liberator|last=Carland|first=Susan|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic Golden Age===
{{See also|Women in Islam|Islamic Golden Age}}

Whilst the pre-modern period lacked a formal feminist movement, nevertheless a number of important figures argued for improving women's rights and autonomy. These range from the medieval mystic and philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]], who argued that women could achieve spiritual stations as equally high as men&lt;ref name=Hakim-2002&gt;{{citation|title=Ibn 'Arabî's Twofold Perception of Woman: Woman as Human Being and Cosmic Principle | first = Souad | last = Hakim | journal =Journal of the Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi Society|volume=31|year=2002|pages=1–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In later eras, [[Nana Asma’u]], daughter of eighteenth-century reformer [[Usman Dan Fodio]], pushed for literacy and the education of Muslim women.&lt;ref name=Mack-2000&gt;{{citation |last1=Mack |first1=Beverly B. |last2=Boyd |first2=Jean |date=2000 |title=One Woman's Jihad: Nana Asma'u, Scholar and Scribe |publisher=Indiana University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Education====
{{See also|Madrasah}}

Wealthy noblewomen often funded Islamic religious and learning establishments, though few of those establishments admitted female students until the twentieth century. For example, [[Fatima al-Fihri]]'s founding of the [[University of Al Karaouine]] in 859 CE, though the university only admitted women (the most notable of whom was [[Fatima al-Kabbaj]]) in the 1900s. This continued through to the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] in the 12th and 13th centuries: of 160 [[mosque]]s and [[madrasah]]s established in [[Damascus]], women funded 26 through the [[Waqf]] ([[charitable trust]] or [[trust law]]) system. Half of all the royal [[Patronage|patrons]] for these institutions were also women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2005|isbn=0-313-32270-8|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Sunni]] scholar [[Ibn Asakir]] in the 12th century, there were opportunities for [[female education]]. He wrote that girls and women could study, earn ''[[ijazah]]s'' ([[academic degree]]s) and qualify as scholars (''[[ulema]]'') and teachers. This was especially the case for learned and scholarly families, who wanted to ensure the highest possible education for both their sons and daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2005|isbn=0-313-32270-8|pages=196 &amp; 198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Asakir had himself studied under 80 different female teachers. Muhammad is said to have praised the women of [[Medina]] for their desire for religious knowledge:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2005|isbn=0-313-32270-8|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; "How splendid were the women of the ''[[Ansar (Islam)|ansar]]''; shame did not prevent them from becoming learned in the faith."

While it was extremely rare for women to enroll as students in formal classes, they did attend informal lectures and study sessions at mosques, madrasahs and other public places. Some men did not approve of this practice. For example, Muhammad ibn al-Hajj (d. 1336) was appalled at the behaviour of some women who informally [[audit]]ed lectures in his time:&lt;ref name=Lindsay&gt;{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2005|isbn=0-313-32270-8|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[Consider] what some women do when people gather with a [[Sheikh|shaykh]] to hear [the recitation of] books. At that point women come, too, to hear the readings; the men sit in one place, the women facing them. It even happens at such times that some of the women are carried away by the situation; one will stand up, and sit down, and shout in a loud voice. [Moreover,] her ''awra'' will appear; in her house, their exposure would be forbidden&amp;nbsp;— how can it be allowed in a mosque, in the presence of men?}}

(''[[Awrah|'awra]]'' refers to the parts of the body that should remain covered; see also ''[[hijab]]'' for the rules of modesty governing both men and women.)

On the question of women in medieval Islam, Abdul Hakim Murad writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the orientalist Ignaz Goldziher showed that perhaps fifteen percent of medieval hadith scholars were women, teaching in the mosques and universally admired for their integrity. Colleges such as the Saqlatuniya Madrasa in Cairo were funded and staffed entirely by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Abdal Hakim Murad |url=http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/ahm/gender.htm |title=Islam, Irigaray, and the retrieval of Gender |publisher=Masud.co.uk |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 15th century, [[Al-Sakhawi]] devotes an entire volume of his 12-volume [[biographical dictionary]] ''Daw al-lami'' to female scholars, giving information on 1,075 of them.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Taliban assumed power in 1995, women's education was outlawed, and forced to go underground. Once the Taliban was overthrown, there is an opportunity for women's education to resurface once again, but it is difficult due to remaining stigmas and male power in the system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In August 2012, official Iranian sources released the news that women would be restricted from joining undergraduate courses in 77 technical, science, and engineering programs in 36 different Iranian Universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://muftah.org/iranian-women-victims-of-economic-strain/#.V_u8gzug9E4|title=Iranian Women: Victims of Economic Strain|last=|first=|date=2012-09-06|work=|newspaper=Muftah|language=en-US|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[labor force]] in the [[Caliphate]] came from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds, while both men and women were involved in diverse occupations and [[Islamic economics in the world|economic activities]].&lt;ref&gt;Maya Shatzmiller, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were employed in a wide range of commercial activities and diverse occupations&lt;ref name=Maya-400-1&gt;Maya Shatzmiller (1994), ''Labour in the Medieval Islamic World'', [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|90-04-09896-8}}, pp. 400–1&lt;/ref&gt; in the primary sector (as farmers for example), secondary sector (as construction workers, dyers, spinners, etc.) and tertiary sector (as investors, doctors, nurses, presidents of [[guild]]s, brokers, peddlers, lenders, scholars, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Maya Shatzmiller, pp. 350–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim women also held a monopoly over certain branches of the [[textile industry]],&lt;ref name=Maya-400-1/&gt; the largest and most specialized and market-oriented industry at the time, in occupations such as [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[dyeing]], and [[embroidery]].

In the 12th century, the famous [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] and ''[[qadi]]'' (judge) [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]], known to the West as ''Averroes'', claimed that women were equal to men in all respects and possessed equal capacities to shine [[Peace In Islamic Thought|in peace]] and [[Islamic military jurisprudence|in war]], citing examples of female warriors among the Arabs, Greeks and Africans to support his case.&lt;ref name=Ahmad&gt;{{citation|last=Ahmad|first=Jamil|date=September 1994|title=Ibn Rushd|journal=[[Al-Mawrid|Monthly Renaissance]]|volume=4|issue=9|url=http://www.monthly-renaissance.com/issue/content.aspx?id=744|accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early [[Muslim history]], examples of notable women who fought during the [[Muslim conquests]] and [[Fitna (word)|Fitna]] (civil wars) as soldiers or generals included [[Nusaybah Bint k'ab Al Maziniyyah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realnews247.com/girl_power.htm|title=ABCNEWS.com : The Cost of Women in Combat|work=realnews247.com|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aisha]],&lt;ref name="Baghdad"&gt;{{Citation|last=Black|first=Edwin|title=Banking on Baghdad: Inside Iraq's 7,000 Year History of War, Profit, and Conflict|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year= 2004|isbn=0-471-70895-X|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kahula]] and Wafeira.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Woman's Record: Or, Sketches of All Distinguished Women, from "The Beginning Till A.D. 1850, Arranged in Four Eras, with Selections from Female Writers of Every Age| author=Hale, Sarah Josepha Buell |publisher=Harper Brothers|year=1853|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|As for [[sexism]], the [[common law]] long denied married women any property rights or indeed legal personality apart from their husbands.

In contrast to the [[Western world]], during the 15th century and afterward, where divorce was relatively uncommon until modern times, divorce (''[[Talaq (Nikah)|talaq]]'') was a more common occurrence at certain points during that era in the [[Muslim world]]. In the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] and early [[Ottoman Empire]], the rate of divorce was higher than it is today in the modern Middle East, at least according to one study.&lt;ref name=Rapoport&gt;{{citation|title=Marriage, Money and Divorce in Medieval Islamic Society |first=Yossef|last=Rapoport|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0-521-84715-X|page=2}}

===Nineteenth century===
The modern movement of Islamic feminism began in the nineteenth century. The [[Iran]]ian poet [[Táhirih]] was the first [[Modern history|modern]] woman to undertake Qur'anic [[exegesis]]. Born and raised in a traditional Muslim family, she would later become a prominent member of the Bábí Faith, during which time she openly denounced [[polygyny]], the wearing of the [[Hijab|veil]] and other restraints put upon women. One of her most notable quotes is her final utterance prior to her execution in August 1852, "You can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Maneck | first =Susan Stiles  | editor-last =Āfāqī | editor-first = Ṣābir| editor2-last =Jasion| editor2-first =Jan T. | title =Táhirih in History: Perspectives on Qurratu'l-'Ayn from East and West  | chapter =Táhirih: A Religious Paradigm of Womanhood |chapterurl =https://books.google.com/books?id=u_4CBxfhsnIC&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;pg=PA185#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | publisher =Kalimat Press | series =RENNER studies on new religions | volume =7 | year =2004 | pages =185–201 | language = | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=u_4CBxfhsnIC |isbn = 978-1-890688-35-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian jurist [[Qasim Amin]], the author of the 1899 pioneering book ''Women's Liberation'' (''Tahrir al-Mar'a''), is often described as the father of the [[Feminism in Egypt|Egyptian feminist movement]]. In his work, Amin criticized some of the practices prevalent in his society at the time, such as [[Polygyny in Islam|polygyny]], [[Islam and clothing|the veil]], and ''[[purdah]]'', i.e. [[sex segregation in Islam]]. He condemned them as un-Islamic and contradictory to the true spirit of Islam. His work had an enormous influence on women's political movements throughout the Islamic and [[Arab world]], and is read and cited today.

Despite Qasim Amin's effects on modern-day Islamic feminist movements, present-day scholar Leila Ahmed considers his works both [[androcentric]] and [[colonialist]].&lt;ref&gt;Leila Ahmed. Women and Gender in Islam. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1992. pp.155-163, 171, 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad 'Abdu, an Egyptian nationalist,&lt;ref&gt;Leila Ahmed. Women and Gender in Islam. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1992. pp.136-137.&lt;/ref&gt; could easily have written the chapters of his work that show honest considerations of the negative effects of the veil on women.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Ahmed. Women and Gender in Islam. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1992. pp.159,161.&lt;/ref&gt; Amin even posed many male-centered misconceptions about women, such as their inability to experience love, that women needlessly (when they had very good reason to) talk about their husbands outside their presence, and that Muslim marriage is based on ignorance and sensuality, of which women were the chief source.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Ahmed. Women and Gender in Islam. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1992. pp.157-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less known, however, are the women who preceded Amin in their feminist critique of their societies. The women's press in Egypt started voicing such concerns since its very first issues in 1892. Egyptian, Turkish, Iranian, Syrian and Lebanese women and men had been reading European feminist magazines even a decade earlier, and discussed their relevance to the Middle East in the general press.&lt;ref&gt;see "Great Ancestors: Women Asserting Rights in Muslim Contexts", by Farida Shaheed with Aisha L.F. Shaheed (London/Lahore: WLUML/Shirkat Gah, 2005) [http://www.wluml.org/english/pubsfulltxt.shtml?%5B87%5D=i-87-186208]{{dead link|date=November 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===
[[Aisha Abd al-Rahman]], writing under her pen name ''Bint al-Shati'' ("Daughter of the Riverbank"), was the second modern woman to undertake Quranic [[exegesis]], and though she did not consider herself to be a feminist, her works reflect feminist themes. She began producing her popular books in 1959, the same year that [[Naguib Mahfouz]] published his allegorical and feminist version of the life of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Ruth|last=Roded|title=Bint al-Shati's Wives of the Prophet: Feminist or Feminine?|journal=British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies|date=May 2006|volume=33|issue=1|pages=51–66|doi=10.1080/13530190600603915}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote biographies of early [[women in Islam]], including the [[Aminah bint Wahb|mother]], wives and [[Family tree of Muhammad|daughters]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Prophet]] Muhammad, as well as [[literary criticism]].&lt;ref name="zeidan"&gt;Arab Women Novelists: The Formative Years and Beyond by Joseph T. Zeidan, State University of New York Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fatema Mernissi]] has argued that much of the suppression of women's rights in Islamic societies is the result of political motivation and its consequent manipulative interpretation of hadith, which runs counter to the egalitarian Islamic community of men and women envisioned by Muhammed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mernissi |first=Fatima |authorlink=Fatima Mernissi |year=1992 |title=The Veil and the Male Elite: A Feminist Interpretation of Islam |publisher=New York: Basic Books |isbn=978-0201-63221-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some strains of modern Islamic feminism have opted to expunge hadith from their ideology altogether in favor of a movement focusing only on Qur'anic principles. [[Riffat Hassan]] has advocated one such movement, articulating a theology wherein what are deemed to be universal rights for humanity outlined in the Qur'an are prioritized over contextual laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Riffat. "Women's Rights inIslam: Normative Teaching versus Practice," in ''Islam and Human Rights: Advancing a U.S.- Muslim Dialogue'', edited by Shireen T. Hunter with Huma Malik, The CSIS Press, Washington D.C., 2005, pp. 43-66.&lt;/ref&gt; She has additionally claimed that the Qur'an, taken alone as scripture, does not present females either as a creation preceded by the male or as the instigator of the "[[Original sin|Fall of Man]]".&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Riffat. "Woman and Man's "fall": A Qur'anic Theological Perspective," in ''Muslima Theology: The Voices of Muslim Women Theologians'', edited by Ednan Aslan, Marcia Hermansen, and Elif Medini, Peter Lang, Frankfurt, 2013, pp. 101-113.&lt;/ref&gt; This theological movement has been met with criticism from other Muslim feminists such as Kecia Ali, who has criticized its selective nature for ignoring elements within the Muslim tradition that could prove helpful in establishing more egalitarian norms in Islamic society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sexual Ethics &amp; Islam|last = Ali|first = Kecia|publisher = Oneworld|year = 2006|isbn = 978-1-85168-456-4|location = London|pages = 154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan]] (RAWA) is a women's organization based in [[Quetta]], [[Pakistan]], that promotes women's rights and [[secular democracy]]. The organization aims to involve women of Afghanistan in both political and social activities aimed at acquiring [[human rights]] for [[Women's rights in Afghanistan|women]] and continuing the struggle against the [[government of Afghanistan]] based on democratic and secular, not fundamentalist principles, in which women can participate fully.&lt;ref name=Lantos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human+Rights+Caucus/Briefing+Testimonies/Fahima+Vorgetts.htm |title=RAWA testimony to the Congressional Human Rights Caucus Briefing |publisher=U.S. Congressional Human Rights Caucus |date=December 18, 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628022728/http://lantos.house.gov/HoR/CA12/Human+Rights+Caucus/Briefing+Testimonies/Fahima+Vorgetts.htm |archivedate=June 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The organization was founded in 1977 by a group of intellectuals led by [[Meena Keshwar Kamal|Meena]] (she did not use a last name). They founded the organization to promote equality and education for women and continues to "give voice to the deprived and silenced women of Afghanistan". In 1979 RAWA campaigned against [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|DRA]], and organized meetings in schools to mobilize support against it, and in 1981, launched a [[Multilingualism|bilingual]] [[List of feminist art magazines|feminist magazine]], ''[[Payam-e-Zan]]'' (Women's Message).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mehta, Sunita.

Before 1978, RAWA focused mainly on women's rights and democracy, but after the coup of 1978, directed by Moscow, and the 1979 Soviet Occupation of Afghanistan, "Rawa became directly involved in the war of resistance, advocating democracy and secularism from the outset".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2015 a group of Muslim activists, politicians, and writers issued a Declaration of Reform which, among other things, supports women's rights and states in part, "We support equal rights for women, including equal rights to inheritance, witness, work, mobility, personal law, education, and employment.

As such it tackles issues covered under Malaysia's Islamic family and [[Syariah Court|syariah]] laws, such as polygamy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/132369|title=Polygamy not a God-given right to Muslims|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; child marriage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/sideviews/article/syariah-court-fails-to-protect-and-safeguard-muslim-girls-sisters-in-islam|title=Syariah court fails to protect and safeguard Muslim girls — Sisters in Islam|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714201933/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/sideviews/article/syariah-court-fails-to-protect-and-safeguard-muslim-girls-sisters-in-islam|archivedate=2014-07-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; moral policing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/story.aspx/?file=%2f2006%2f12%2f17%2fnation%2f16348692&amp;sec=nation|title=Archives|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic legal theory and jurisprudence, the hijab and modesty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sistersinislam.org.my/comment.php?comment.news.309|title=Sisters In Islam: News / Comments / Dress and Modesty in Islam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; violence against women and [[hudud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sistersinislam.org.my/news.php?item.903.121|title=Sisters In Islam: Sisters in Islam remains firmly opposed to the implementation of Hudud law for Malaysia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their mission is to promote the principles of gender equality, justice, freedom, and dignity of Islam and empower women to be advocates for change.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sisters In Islam: Mission Statement and Objectives|url = http://www.sistersinislam.org.my/page.php?36|website = www.sistersinislam.org.my|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They seek to promote a framework of women's rights in Islam which take into consideration women's experiences and realities; they want to eliminate the injustice and discrimination that women may face by changing mindsets that may hold women to be inferior to men; and they want to increase the public knowledge and reform laws and policies within the framework of justice and equality in Islam.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Prominent members are [[Zainah Anwar]],&lt;ref name="SIS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1879864,00.html|title=Muslim Women Demand End to Oppressive Laws|first=Carla|last=Power|date=17 February 2009|publisher=|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder [[Amina Wadud]].&lt;ref name="sistersinislam.org.my"&gt;[http://www.sistersinislam.org.my/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=916&amp;Itemid=312 New Straits Times - The day I met Amina Wadud] By Siti Nurbaiyah Nadzmi&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Muslim Women's Quest for Equality ====
In September 2016, the group Muslim Women’s Quest for Equality petitioned the [[Supreme Court of India]] against the practices of ''[[w:Divorce in Islam|talaq-e-bidat]]'' (triple talaq), ''[[nikah halala]]'' and [[Polygyny in Islam|polygyny]] under the Muslim personal laws illegal and [[Constitution of India|unconstitutional]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muslim-women-s-group-demands-complete-ban-on-shariah-courts/story-kgNMV7LwDSgEaMRAOIecfI.html |title=Muslim women’s group demands complete ban on Shariah courts &amp;#124; india-news |publisher=Hindustan Times |date= |accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/sc-admits-muslim-womans-plea-to-declare-triple-talaq-illegal/article9036511.ece |title=SC admits Muslim woman's plea to declare triple talaq illegal |publisher=The Hindu |date=2016-08-26 |accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Musawah ====
In 2009, twelve women from the Arab world formed the global movement [[Musawah]], whose name means "equality" in Arabic. Musawah advocates for feminist interpretations of Islamic texts and calls on nations to abide by international human rights standards such as those promulgated in the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]. Musawah's approach is modeled after that of Sisters in Islam. [[Secular feminism|Secular feminists]] have criticized Musawah, arguing that Islam is shaky ground on which to build a feminist movement, given that interpretation of Islamic sources is subjective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/rise-islamic-feminists/|title=The Rise of the Islamic Feminists - The Nation|first=Elizabeth|last=Segran|publisher=|via=www.thenation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of campaign==

===Personal law===
{{See also|Islamic marital jurisprudence}}

One of the major areas of scholarship and campaigning for Islamic feminists are aspects of sharia (Islamic law) known as Muslim personal law (MPL) or Muslim family law. There is dispute that the use of ''sharia'' law is oppressive because they are based mainly on "man-made misinterpretations of the sacred texts" and are not based in Islam.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Some of the thorny issues regarding the way in which MPL has thus far been formulated include [[Polygamy in Islam|polygyny]], [[Divorce in Islam|divorce]], custody of children, maintenance and marital property. In addition, there are also more macro issues regarding the underlying assumptions of such legislation, for example, the assumption of the man as [[head of the household]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Muslim majority countries]] that have promulgated some form of MPL include [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Libya]], [[Sudan]], [[Senegal]], [[Tunisia]], [[Egypt]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Bangladesh]]. Muslim minority countries that already have incorporated MPL into their own law or are considering passing legislation on aspects of MPL include [[India]], [[Israel]], and [[South Africa]].

One of such controversial interpretations involve passages in the Quran that discuss the idea of a man's religious obligation to support women.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fluehr-Lobban |first1=Carolyn |title=Toward a Theory of Arab-Muslim Women as Activists in Secular and Religious Movements |journal=Arab Studies Quarterly |date=1993 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=87–106 |jstor=41858975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, such as anthropologist [[Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban]] in her work on Arab-Muslim women activists' engagement in secular religious movements, argue that this assertion of a religious obligation "has traditionally been used as a rationale for the social practice of male authority."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In some countries the legislative and administrative application of male authority is used to justify denying women access to the public sphere through the "denial of permission to travel or work outside the home, or even drive a car."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; On Sept. 26, 2017 [[Saudi Arabia]] announced it would end its longstanding policy banning women from driving in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-women-drive.html|title=Saudi Arabia Agrees to Let Women Drive|last=Hubbard|first=Ben|date=2017-09-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various female activists had protested the ban, among them Saudi women's rights activists [[Manal al-Sharif]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=al-Sharif|first=Manal|title=A Saudi woman who dared to drive|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/manal_al_sharif_a_saudi_woman_who_dared_to_drive/transcript#t-21085|language=en|accessdate=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; by posting videos of them driving on social media platforms.

Islamic feminists have objected to the MPL legislation in many of these countries, arguing that these pieces of legislation discriminate against women. Some Islamic feminists have taken the attitude that a reformed MPL which is based on the Quran and [[sunnah]], which includes substantial input from Muslim women, and which does not discriminate against women is possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's Rights In Islam|last=Chaudry|first=Muhammad Sharif|publisher=Adam &amp; Distributors|year=1991|isbn=|location=Delhi|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such Islamic feminists have been working on developing women-friendly forms of MPL. (See, for example, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070626213151/http://www.ccmw.com/GTAForum/index.htm the Canadian Council of Muslim Women] for argument based on the Qur'an and not on what they call medieval male consensus.) Other Islamic feminists, particularly some in Muslim minority contexts which are democratic states, argue that MPL should not be reformed but should be rejected and that Muslim women should seek redress, instead, from the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]s of those states. &lt;!--this paragraph needs to cite sources and name the women or groups, instead of "some Islamic feminists."--&gt;

===Dress codes===
{{See also|Sartorial hijab|Islam and clothing|Awrah|Purdah}}
[[File:Hijab Niqab Muslim Veil.jpg|thumb|Mannequins showing different styles of hijab head-covering]]
Another issue that concerns Muslim women is the [[dress code]] expected of them. Islam requires both men and women to dress modestly; this concept is known as ''[[hijab]]'' and covers a wide interpretation of behavior and garments.  There is mixed opinion among Muslim feminists over extremes of externally imposed control. Modern Sufi groups such as [[Al-Ahbash]], does not make it mandatory for Women to wear traditional Islamic clothing even allowing jeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elrich |first1=Hagai |title=Al-Ahbash and Wahabi |publisher=Cambridge University |page=528 |url=http://aigaforum.com/documents/Al-Ahbash-whaibyya.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Islamic feminists, including [[Fadela Amara]] and [[:fr:Hédi M'henni|Hedi Mhenni]] support bans on the ''hijab'' for various reasons. Amara explained her support for France's ban of the garment in public buildings: "The veil is the visible symbol of the subjugation of women, and therefore has no place in the mixed, [[Laïcité|secular spaces]] of [[education in France|France's public school system]]."&lt;ref name="guardian17Jul2006"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jul/17/france.politicsphilosophyandsociety | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Ghetto warrior | date=July 17, 2006 | accessdate=May 5, 2010 | first=Rose | last=George}}&lt;/ref&gt; When some feminists began defending the headscarf on the grounds of "tradition", Amara was quoted as saying: "It's not tradition, it's archaic! French feminists are totally contradictory. When [[women in Algeria|Algerian women]] fought against wearing the headscarf in [[Algeria]], [[feminism in France|French feminists]] supported them. But when it's some young girl in a [[Banlieue|French suburb]] school, they don't. They define [[Liberté, égalité, fraternité|liberty and equality]] according to what colour your skin is. It's nothing more than [[neocolonialism]]."&lt;ref name="guardian17Jul2006"/&gt; Mhenni also expressed support for [[Tunisia]]'s ban on the veil: "If today we accept the headscarf, tomorrow we'll accept that women's rights to work and vote and receive an education be banned and they'll be seen as just a tool for reproduction and housework."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2006-10/06/06.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=August 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601165818/http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2006-10/06/06.shtml |archivedate=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sihem Habchi]], Muslim feminist and director of [[Ni Putes Ni Soumises]], expressed support for France's ban on the burqa in public places, stating that the ban was a matter of 'democratic principle' and protecting French women from the 'obscurantist, fascist, right-wing movement' that she claims the burqa represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_8568000/8568024.stm | work=BBC News | title=France's burka dilemma | date=March 15, 2010 | first=Zubeida | last=Malik}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vingtparismagazine.com/2010/01/ni-putes-ni-soumises-organizes-a-protest-against-the-burqa.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522080511/http://www.vingtparismagazine.com/2010/01/ni-putes-ni-soumises-organizes-a-protest-against-the-burqa.html|date=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, there is also strong support in favor of the veil. Both men and women now view the veil as a symbol of Islamic freedom. As a growing number of individuals have accepted and incorporated the hijab into their cultural dress, women are beginning to reclaim the meaning behind the veil. The veil itself acts as a different experience lived by each woman who wears a veil.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; “It is no longer a bandanna version of the all-encompassing Afghan burqa, signaling a woman's brainwashed submissiveness or at the very least her lack of choice”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2076653,00.html | work=Time | title=Is the Veil Now a Symbol of Islamic Freedom? | date=June 13, 2011 | first=Azadeh | last=Moeveni}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many scholars agree that there is no scripture that requires women to wear the hijab but many still do as an act of religious piety.

A growing number of women have began to incorporate the hijab into their cultural dress, whether they live in predominantly Muslim countries or not. The veil itself acts as a different experience lived by each woman who wears it, rather than a homogenizing item of clothing. Over the past ten years, the hijab has become more prominent in countries of the world where wearing the hijab itself is not required of women by state law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berger |first1=Anne-Emmanuelle |title=The Newly Veiled Woman: Irigaray, Specularity, and the Islamic Veil |journal=Diacritics |date=1998 |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=93–119 |jstor=1566326}}&lt;/ref&gt; The willingness to wear the veil outside of required states acts as a radical statement in some instances, in a way reclaiming the symbol and meaning of the veil. Where the veil once stereotypically represented the oppression of women, it now acts as a power statement of pride in religion, femininity, and sexual identity. Feminist philosophers such as [[Luce Irigaray]] also note that the veil can take on the role of empowerment regarding a women's sexual difference from man.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The Qur'an does state that both men and women should be dressed modestly (33:59-60, 24:30-31; in translation by Ali, 1988, 1126–27). However it does not use the words veil, hijab, burka, chador, or abaya. It uses the words ''jilbab'' meaning cloak and ''khumur'' meaning shawl. These do not cover the face, hands, or feet. Furthermore, until the third through the ninth century{{clarify|Third to ninth century in Islamic calendar, presumably? That should probably just be changed to the corresponding centuries in the Common Era, for clarity. Also, ''until'' the third ''through'' the ninth makes little sense|date=October 2017}} women prayed in the mosques unveiled. The whole body covering with the burka, chador, and other items of clothing is a tradition and cultural manifest from a conservative reading of the Qur'an by Mullahs; men. It is not what the Qur'an itself states.&lt;ref&gt;"Believing Women in Islam" by Asma Barlos, University of Texas Press, Austin. 2002, 53-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachel Woodlock, an academic and writer specializing in Islam, has detailed in an article that the issue of wearing the veil depends on specific cultures along with cultural context. In addition, modern Muslim feminists believe that ultimately the importance lies in a woman's freedom of choice---her choice to wear the veil or not to, and not have her right to do so threatened. Muslim women should be able to define dress codes for themselves and what they deem to be morally right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irfi.org/articles/articles_301_350/veiling_and_hijab_as_understood.htm|title=Veiling and Hijab as understood|work=irfi.org|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Woman-1439745 1920.jpg|thumb|Woman modeling contemporary hijab fashion]]
In her book ''Muslim Fashion: Contemporary Style Cultures'', [[London College of Fashion]] Cultural Studies professor [[Reina Lewis]] states that the evolution of mainstream [[hijab]] fashion serves as an outlet for Muslim women to demonstrate creativity and individuality in their development of a personal style that adheres to the code of dressing modestly. This gives Muslim women, particularly those of younger generations, the personal decision to wear the hijab is an opportunity to express their contemporary ideas on Muslim femininity.
[[File:Tichel headcovering.jpg|thumb|Tichel]]
Not only is clothing modesty widely symbolic in Muslim communities and Islamic religious beliefs, but the method of head covering has many connections between religions as well. Reina Lewis discusses this connection of religious practices in her book, “''Modest Fashion: Styling Bodies, Mediating Faith,''” where she brings up the political divide between Jews and Muslims.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Modest_Fashion.html?id=60FDqEAV_dIC|title=Modest Fashion: Styling Bodies, Mediating Faith|last=Lewis|first=Reina|date=2013-07-30|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781780763835|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim headwear designer, Wegdan Hamza, was intrigued to find out the large appeal of her website to Orthodox Jewish Women. Hamza was born and raised in Egypt, and had been wearing a Hijab for her entire life. Hamza speaks out about how she was delighted that her designs had become of interest in interfaith modesty, since she sees head covering as "a link between all the Holy religions", which can further help to "reduce anger between mankind".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|84}} The "''tichel"'' is compared to the muslim "hijab" in Judaism, which is Yiddish for headscarf. According to the "Encyclopedia of Judaism", written by Sara E. Karesh, and Mitchell M. Hurvitz, the tichel is discussed in the Jewish laws of modesty as a required article of clothing worn by married women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=Z2cCZBDm8F8C&amp;pg=PA519&amp;lpg=PA519&amp;dq=tichel+meaning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vKoWWuLJwa&amp;sig=gyDfTra2fx-4QZFdk6t3syHHKfs&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjiIThrfrOAhUBxxQKHdycAT44ChDoAQhdMA0#v=onepage&amp;q=tichel&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Judaism|first1=Sara E.|last1=Karesh|first2=Mitchell M.|last2=Hurvitz|date=15 August 2018|publisher=Infobase Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many variations of the headscarf in Judaism, such as "''mitpachat"'' in Hebrew, or "''shmateh''", all meaning the same thing. While they are called many different things in both Judaism and Islamic religions, they have many of the same rules, and coincide on many ideological levels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Equality in the Mosque===
{{see also|Islamic Bill of Rights for Women in the Mosque}}
A survey by the Council on American Islamic Relations showed that two out of three mosques in 2000 required women to pray in a separate area, up from one out of two in 1994.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Asra Q. Nomani |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-02-27/let-these-women-pray/ |title=Let These Women Pray! |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=2010-02-27 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Islamic feminists have begun to protest this, advocating for women to be allowed to pray beside men without a partition as they do in Mecca.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/21/AR2010052104253.html |title=Mosque pray-ins against segregation of sexes are springing up |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |accessdate=2012-08-13 |first1=William |last1=Wan |first2=Michael |last2=Laris |date=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marsh |first=Julia |url=http://www.womensenews.org/story/religion/100222/protesters-break-prayer-rules-at-leading-mosque |title=Protesters Break Prayer Rules at Leading Mosque |publisher=Women's eNews |date=2010-02-22 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, [[Asra Nomani]] challenged the rules at her mosque in Morgantown, West Virginia, that required women to enter through a back door and pray in a secluded balcony.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"/&gt;  She argued that in the 7th century the Islamic prophet Muhammad didn't put women behind partitions, and that barriers preventing women from praying equally with men are just sexist man-made rules.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"/&gt;  The men at her mosque put her on trial to be banished.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"/&gt;

As of 2004 in the United States, some mosques have constitutions prohibiting women from voting in board elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/22/us/muslim-women-seeking-a-place-in-the-mosque.html|title=Muslim Women Seeking a Place in the Mosque|date=22 July 2004|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, following public agitation on the issue, Muslim organizations that included the CAIR and the Islamic Society of North America issued a report on making mosques "women-friendly", to assert women's rights in mosques, and to include women's right to pray in the main hall without a partition.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"/&gt;

In 2010, American Muslim Fatima Thompson and a few others organized and participated in a "pray-in" at the Islamic Center of Washington in D.C.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"/&gt; Police were summoned and threatened to arrest the women when they refused to leave the main prayer hall. The women continued their protest against being corralled in what they referred to as the "penalty box" (a prayer space reserved for only women). Fatima Thompson called the penalty box "an overheated, dark back room."&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"/&gt;  A second protest also staged by the same group on the eve of International Women's Day in 2010 resulted in calls to the police and threats of arrest again.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"/&gt;  However, the women were not arrested on either occasion.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast1"/&gt;

Furthermore, in May 2010, five women prayed with men at the Dar al-Hijrah mosque, one of the Washington region's largest Islamic centers.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;  After the prayers, a member of the mosque called Fairfax police who asked the women to leave.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;  However, later in 2010, it was decided that D.C. police would no longer intervene in such protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Myers |first=Bill |date=21 June 2010 |title=Police won't intervene to remove women from mosques |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/d.c.-police-wont-intervene-to-remove-women-from-mosques/article/12885 |work=Washington Examiner |accessdate=August 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a group of Muslim activists, politicians, and writers issued a Declaration of Reform which states in part, "Men and women have equal rights in mosques, boards, leadership and all spheres of society. We reject sexism and misogyny."&lt;ref name="secularism1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="M. Zuhdi Jasser and Raheel Raza"/&gt; That same year [[Asra Nomani]] and others placed the Declaration on the door of the Islamic Center of Washington.&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"/&gt;

===Equality in leading prayer===
{{Main|Women as imams}}

According to currently existing traditional schools of Islam, a woman cannot lead a mixed gender congregation in salat (prayer). Some schools make exceptions for [[Tarawih]] (optional [[Ramadan]] prayers) or for a congregation consisting only of close relatives. Certain medieval scholars—including [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] (838–923), [[Abu Thawr]] (764–854), Isma'il Ibn Yahya al-Muzani (791–878), and [[Ibn Arabi]] (1165–1240) considered the practice permissible at least for optional (''[[Nafl prayer|nafl]]'') prayers; however, their views are not accepted by any major surviving group. Islamic feminists have begun to protest this.

On March 18, 2005, [[Amina Wadud]] led a mixed-gender congregational Friday prayer in New York City. It sparked a controversy within the Muslim community because the imam was a woman, Wadud, who also delivered the khutbah.&lt;ref name=Hammer&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammer|first=Juliane|title=American Muslim Women, Religious Authority, and Activism|year=2012|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the congregation she addressed was not separated by gender. This event that departed from the established ritual practice became an embodied performance of gender justice in the eyes of its organizers and participants. The event was widely publicized in the global media and caused an equally global debate among Muslims.&lt;ref name=Hammer /&gt; However, many Muslims, including women, remain in disagreement with the idea of a women as imam. Muzammil Siddiqi, chairman of the Fiqh Council of North America, argued that prayer leadership should remain restricted to men&lt;ref name=Hammer /&gt;  He based his argument on the longstanding practice and thus community consensus and emphasized the danger of women distracting men during prayers.

The events that occurred in regards to equality in the Mosque and women leading prayers, show the enmity Muslim feminists may receive when voicing opposition toward sexism and establishing efforts to combat it. Those who criticize Muslim feminists state that those who question the faith's views on gender segregation, or who attempt to make changes, are overstepping their boundaries and are acting offensively. On the other hand, people have stated that Islam does not advocate gender segregation. Britain's influential Sunni imam, [[Ahtsham Ali]], has stated, "gender segregation has no basis in Islamic law" nor is it justified in the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/08/02/UK-imam-Quran-does-not-justify-gender-segregation-.html|title=British imam: Quran does not rule on segregation|website=english.alarabiya.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article, “Woman Imam Leading Men and Women in Salat” written by Muzammil Siddiqi, he states that the reason women are not supposed to lead prayer is because “It is not permissible to introduce any new style or liturgy in Salat.” Siddiqi states that woman should not be leading prayer because it strays away from the tradition of men teaching. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.islamicity.org/2576/woman-imam-leading-men-and-women-in-salat/.|title=Woman Imam Leading Men and Women in Salat - IslamiCity|website=www.islamicity.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism in Islam==

Margot Badran explains that Islamic feminism “derives its understanding and mandate from the Qur’an, seeks rights and justice for women, and for men, in the totality of their existence.”&lt;ref&gt;Badran, Margot. Feminism in Islam : Secular and Religious Convergences. Oxford : Oneworld, 2009., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; She explains in her writings that the radicalization that Islamists (political Islam) have corrupted Islam with the image of patriarchy and oppression to women. This image is what the rest of the world sees and understands Islam to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2008/nov/09/islam-women|title=Margot Badran: What does Islamic feminism have to offer?

Asma Barlas, shares Badran’s views, discussing the difference between secular feminists and Islamic feminism and in countries where Muslims make up 98% of the population, it is not possible to avoid engaging “its basic beliefs.”&lt;ref&gt;(https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2008/nov/09/islam-women&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay by Fatima Seedat, “Beyond the text,” Seedat agrees with both Barlas and Badran on their views about the importance of feminism in the Islamic world. However, she debates the term “Islamic Feminism” is unnecessary since feminism is a “social practice, not merely of personal identity.”&lt;ref&gt;Seedat, Fatima, author. "Beyond the Text: Between Islam and Feminism." Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion, no. 2, 2016, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Seedat believes the convergence of both Islamic and feminism creates more conflict and opens more doors for “Islamists” to interpret or misinterpret the Qur'an to suit their political needs. She believes it is important to speak about and illustrate how feminism has existed in the lines of the Qur'an. By separating the two and giving their own space, it will be more inclusive to everyone (men, women, Muslims and non-Muslims). In the same article, “Feminism, and Islamic Feminism: Between Inadequacy and Inevitability,” Seedat explains that the existence of such a term separates Muslims and Isolates them from the rest of the world and the universal feminist movement. She states in her essay the importance of sharing with the rest of the world what Islam has to offer feminism, and to show the true image of Islam by not referring to themselves as Islamic feminists.

==Equality between men and women in Islam==
Dr. Zakir Naik explains in the YouTube video, "Are Men and Women Equal in Islam?" that there is a difference between men and women in Islam as far as physical differences and their roles given by God. In the video, Dr. Naik compares Muslim women’s rights to non-Muslim women’s rights in the West, making points about how Muslim women are looked at as oppressed because they choose to wear hijab. However, he argues that women in the west or non-Muslim women are oppressed and lack many rights. In the video, Dr. Naik says, "Islam believes in equality between men and women, but equality does not mean identicality." 

Dr. Naik also mentions the scripture in the Quran that is dedicated to women, "Surat elnisaa," meaning the scripture of women. The scripture talks about women and their rights as well as orphans and that God rewards those who look after and protect women and orphans (and children).

Dr. Naik also shares examples from the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, emphasizing "the negativity of disobeying the mother more than the father," to show how just Islam is to women, and not oppressive as many people around the world think of Islam. He uses the example of separate sports teams rather than unisex. Women do not even play tennis unless each opposing couple is one male and one female. Tennis matches do not consist of two women against two men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gmp6IzY3hbM&amp;feature=youtu.be|title=Are Men and Women Equal in Islam by Dr Zakir Naik|first=|last=Islamic Clips|date=13 July 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women in Islam==

Khawla bint al-Azwar,&lt;ref&gt;[[Khawlah bint al-Azwar]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}} was a female Muslim warrior/soldier during the life of the prophet Mohammad. Her brother, Dhiraar al-Azwar, trained her to fight and she fought with him in many battles. It is said that it was not known that she was a female when in battle because all soldiers were dressed in loose clothing and wrapped themselves in cloth to protect themselves from the sand and dust. After proving herself as a soldier by showing her talent and skill in combat, she revealed herself to the men she fought next to. Since then, Khawla was essential to have in every battle that followed.

In Sahih Muslim, which is one of the books which include the teachings and traditions of the Prophet Muhammad. Abu Huraira (one of the Caliphates) reported that a person came to the Prophet and asked: “Who among the people is most deserving of a fine treatment from my hand? He said: Your mother. He again said: Then who (is the next one)? He said: Again it is your mother (who deserves the best treatment from you). He said: Then who (is the next one)? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Again, it is your mother. He (again) said: Then who? Thereupon he said: Then it is your father.” This is one example that many scholars use to show the inclusion of women and their rights in the Quran/Islam.&lt;ref&gt;"Sahih Muslim." In The Oxford Dictionary of Islam. Ed. John L. Esposito. Oxford Islamic Studies Online. Nov 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Quran: Surah 4:19&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-4/verse-19/|title=Quran Surah An-Nisaa ( Verse 19 ) with English Translation يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا يَحِلُّ لَكُمْ أَنْ تَرِثُوا النِّسَاءَ كَرْهًا ۖ وَلَا تَعْضُلُوهُنَّ لِتَذْهَبُوا بِبَعْضِ مَا آتَيْتُمُوهُنَّ إِلَّا أَنْ يَأْتِينَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ مُبَيِّنَةٍ ۚ وَعَاشِرُوهُنَّ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ ۚ فَإِنْ كَرِهْتُمُوهُنَّ فَعَسَىٰ أَنْ تَكْرَهُوا شَيْئًا وَيَجْعَلَ اللَّهُ فِيهِ خَيْرًا كَثِيرًا|website=IReBD.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
O ye who believe! Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Nor should ye treat them with harshness, that ye may Take away part of the dower ye have given them,-except where they have been guilty of open lewdness; on the contrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity. If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing, and God brings about through it a great deal of good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.call-to-monotheism.com/men_and_women_s_rights_in_islam__equal_or_equally_balanced_|title=Men and Women's Rights in Islam: Equal or Equally Balanced?|website=www.call-to-monotheism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this scripture it is explained by Sahih Muslim that this speaks to men to take care of their wives, and those who do not will suffer the consequences. Dr. Naik, in his video explains that this is not to give men a higher status than women, but to give them the role of caretaker because they(men) are created physically stronger than women. He stresses on the different roles they are given as men and women because of how God created them. Men are providers and women are the caregivers at home, given more patience, resilience, and the ability to forgive more than men.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1655">'''Kumtepe''' is the oldest permanent settlement in the [[Troad|Troas]], the region in northwestern Anatolia, where later Troy was built. Kumtepe has four layers, Kumtepe IA, IB, IC and II. The last two have been largely disturbed in the twentieth century. The remaining and relatively undisturbed IA and IB are of special interest to the archaeologists, because these are older than other settlements in the region.

Around 4800 BC the first settlement in Kumtepe was founded. The inhabitants lived on fishing, and their diet included oysters. The dead were buried, but without grave gifts. Although Kumtepe belongs to Neolithic, the occupants used also [[copper]]. Around 4500 BC the settlement was abandoned.

Around 3700 BC new settlers came to Kumtepe. The people of this new culture, Kumtepe B, built relatively large houses with multiple rooms, sometimes a porch. They also practiced animal husbandry and agriculture. The main domestic animals were goats and sheep, bred not only for meat but for milk and wool as well. They knew lead and bronze along with copper. Shortly after 3000 BC [[Yassıtepe]] and [[Hisarlık]] (Troy) were colonized probably from Kumtepe.

{{nihongo|'''''Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha'''''|魔法少女リリカルなのは|Mahō Shōjo Ririkaru Nanoha}} is a [[Japan]]ese multimedia franchise that encompasses five [[anime]] television series, four theatrical films, multiple [[manga]] and [[Drama CD]] adaptations and sequels, as well as model figures, plastic models and toys from [[Bandai]]. It began in 2004 with ''[[Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha]]'', an [[alternate universe (fan fiction)|alternate universe]] [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of the ''[[Triangle Heart]]'' series, and is on-going to date. This series usually have Multiple Demographic Appeal{{fact|date=November 2018}}, not only are they popular among to children. But also among to teenager/adults{{fact|date=November 2018}}. 

The series is named after its protagonist [[Nanoha Takamachi]]. At the beginning of the series, Nanoha is a 9-year old schoolgirl in modern-day Japan, who is swept into a conflict between [[parallel universe (fiction)|extra-dimensional]] powers vying for control over [[artifact (fantasy)|magical artifacts]] they had discovered on Earth. Nanoha herself is revealed to be tremendously powerful in the extra-dimensional techno-magic and in later installments, leaves Earth altogether to pursue a magical career. In the chronologically latest franchise entry, ''[[Magical Record Lyrical Nanoha Force]]'', she is 25. Nanoha's role has gradually diminished in the installments following ''[[Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS]]'', to the point where she only appears briefly in the 2016 anime ''ViVid Strike!'', which is set in the same universe  but whose title no longer contains her name.

==Origins==
Nanoha Takamachi first appeared as a minor character in the [[eroge]] [[visual novel]] ''[[Triangle Heart#Triangle Heart 3 &amp; Triangle Heart 3 OVA|Triangle Heart 3]]'', released on December 8, 2000.&lt;ref name="TH3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sp-janis.com/soft/trh3.shtml|title=とらいあんぐるハート3 ～Sweet Songs Forever～|publisher=JANIS|accessdate=2009-06-11|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was first cast as a [[magical girl]] on a merchandise CD ''Triangle Heart 3 ~Lyrical Toy Box~'', released on June 29, 2001.&lt;ref name="TH3-LTB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sp-janis.com/soft/trh_box2_1.shtml|script-title=ja:とらいあんぐるハート3　リリカルおもちゃ箱|publisher=JANIS|accessdate=2009-06-11|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanoha's first animated appearance was in the first episode of ''Triangle Heart 3'' [[OVA]] adaptation, released on July 24, 2003.

==Overview==
{{See also|List of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha characters}}
===Main continuity===
In the plot premise of the original series, ''[[Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha]]'' (2004), 21 "Jewel Seeds", highly destructive artifacts from another dimension, are accidentally scattered across Earth. After Nanoha assists an injured extradimensional magician in collecting them, she is drawn into a magical battle against a female mage named [[Fate Testarossa]], who came to Earth to collect Jewel Seeds for her mother Precia. Attracted by their activity, the interdimensional police TSAB ("Time-Space Administration Bureau") intervenes to secure and to seal the artifacts. In the end, Nanoha convinces Fate to rebel against Precia, who is defeated and apparently dies.

In ''[[Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's]]'' (2005), Nanoha continues her magical training. Six months after the original series, she and Fate encounter the "Wolkenritter", four magic knights who steal others' magical abilities to save [[Hayate Yagami]], a wheelchair-using Japanese girl. Since the Wolkenritter are skilled in Ancient Belkan combat magic far superior to theirs, Nanoha and Fate fail to stop them and the Book of Darkness, an ancient artifact bound to Hayate, is activated. A worldwide catastrophe is only prevented thanks to TSAB and most importantly, Hayate's intervention. In the following years, all primary characters leave Earth to pursue magical careers in the TSAB homeworld Midchilda.

''[[Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Strikers|Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS]]'' (2007) takes place ten years after ''A's'' and is set on Midchilda. Hayate, now a Lieutenant Colonel of TSAB, forms a special Riot Force 6 to counter the impending [[terrorist]] crisis organized by Dr. Scaglietti, a former colleague and accomplice of Precia Testarossa, and his combat [[cyborg]]s ("Numbers"). Nanoha, Fate, and the Wolkenritter join the unit, along with four young mages whom they personally train ("Forwards"). Despite their preparations, the unit fails to protect Vivio, a girl targeted by Scaglietti and adopted by Nanoha, and the crisis strikes in full force, stopped in the nick of time by Riot Force 6's heroic efforts. The unit is then dissolved, with its members returning to their original posts.

A Drama CD titled ''[[List of Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha drama CDs#Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS Sound Stage X|Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS Sound Stage X]]'' (2008) is set three years after the Jail Scaglietti Incident. It features the characters first introduced in ''StrikerS'', mainly the Forwards and the [[Numbers (Nanoha)|Numbers]], investigating a serial murder case on Midchilda. Their investigation eventually leads them to the {{sic|Mariage}}, semi-sentient humanoid weapons from the Ancient Belkan era, and their elusive creator, Dark King Ixpellia.

Vivio's story is continued in the manga ''[[Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid]]'' (2009-2017), which is set four years after ''StrikerS''. Vivio now attends a magical academy on Midchilda, where she meets Einhart Stratos, another descendant of the Ancient Belkan [[royal family|royalty]]. Together with their friends, the two of them participate in the Inter-Middle, a magical combat [[tournament]] for young mages. A spin-off anime series, ''ViVid Strike!'' (2016), stars a teen magical martial artist Fuka Reventon, who trains under Einhart for a rematch against her estranged childhood friend, Rinne Berlinetta.

Another manga, ''[[Magical Record Lyrical Nanoha Force]]'' (2009-2013, on hiatus), set six years after ''StrikerS'', focuses on a new protagonist, Thoma Avenir. After Thoma rescues a mute girl named Lily Strosek on remote world, he unwittingly becomes a fugitive from TSAB. The ex-members of Riot Force 6 join forces once again to avert a new crisis caused by dangerous Ancient Belkan legacy, the Book of the Silver Cross, to which Lily is apparently connected, and the Hückebein family, an interdimensional terrorist cell with sights on Thoma.

===Alternate continuities===
The [[PlayStation Portable]] video game ''Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's Portable: The Battle of Aces'' (2010) is set in an [[alternate timeline]] which diverges from the main series at the end of the second anime series. In it, Nanoha and Fate refuse to seal Reinforce, allowing the Book of Darkness to regenerate its defenses and use the heroes' own dark clones to attack them. In the sequel, ''The Gears of Destiny'' (2011), the heroines must battle [[time-travel]]ing humanoid Gears for the future of their respective worlds, and even meet characters from the future (of the main timeline).

The first two theatric movies were largely faithful adaptations of the first two anime seasons, but starting with ''Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Reflection'' (2017), the movies' continuity sharply diverged from the main one by cross-introducing the time-traveling Gears (who are human in this continuity) to the Earth after Reinforce had been sealed. ''Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Detonation'' (2018) is expected to finish the story arc started in ''Reflection''.

''Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Innocent'' (2012-2014) is a spin-off manga series set in a [[alternate universe (fan fiction)|universe parallel]] to the main franchise, where the main characters are ordinary girls who battle each other in a magical card game called "Brave Duel". A follow-up sequel manga, ''Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Innocents'' (2014-2016), featuring younger Subaru and Teana began publication after the first spin-off ended.

===Manga and novels===
''Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha'' novel is an adaptation of the first season, while the ''A's'' manga and ''StrikerS THE COMICS'' are collections of short side-stories expanding the respective anime series. ''ViVid'' and ''Force'' are standalone, independent story arcs that take place several years after the events of ''StrikerS''. ''The MOVIE 1st'' manga, similar to the ''A's'' and ''StrikerS'' manga series, expand on the storyline of the movie. ''Innocent'' is set in a parallel world to the main franchise.

Two [[fighting games]] based on ''A's'' were released by [[Namco Bandai Games]] for [[PlayStation Portable]] in January 2010 and December 2011 respectively. Characters from the ''Nanoha'' franchise appear in the crossover role-playing game, ''Nendoroid Generation'', which is based on the [[Nendoroid]] series of figures.

==Cultural impact==
The franchise takes an innovative approach to the [[magical girl]] genre, focusing much more on combat whereas typical titles focus more on characterization, as well as being targeted at a male demographic. ICv2 praised the ''Nanoha'' franchise for taking a more serious approach to [[social issues]] such as [[child abuse]] than other magical girl anime.&lt;ref name="ICv2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/10857.html|title=''Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha''|publisher=ICv2.com|date=July 2, 2007|accessdate=2009-06-13|quote=The Nanoha series have already gained quite a reputation here in the States among hardcore fans in part because of the genre-bending device of switching technology for 'magic,' and because the series' storylines involving real social problems like child abuse are considerably heavier and more intense than those in other magical girl series.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Oppliger, an analyst for [[AnimeNation]], identified two ways in which the ''Lyrical Nanoha'' franchise deviates from the magical girl genre conventions: the tone and feel of the conflict and the presentation of its central heroine, [[Nanoha Takamachi]]. About the former, he observed that although another magical girl series, ''[[Futari wa Pretty Cure]]'', preceded the first ''Lyrical Nanoha'' anime by six months in introducing an unprecedented amount of [[violence]] to the genre, the fights in ''Pretty Cure'' were still strongly tied to the emotional state and drama of their participants. Whereas in ''Nanoha'', the battles are akin to "magical gunfights"; they appear objective, mechanical, and deadly and are inspired more by the [[science fiction]] and [[mecha]] genres than by the traditional magical girl conflicts. Regarding the latter, Oppliger described the show as trying to evoke [[sympathy]] for Nanoha Takamachi instead of [[empathy]], i.e. ''Nanoha'' presents its heroine from an external [[narrative mode|point of view]] to make the audience feel for her but not [[identification (literature)|want to be her or to be like her]], as other magical girl series do. Such perspective is, according to Oppliger, "used for conventional [[otaku]] anime" and makes the anime more accessible to the [[seinen manga|older male demographic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2012/03/23/ask-john-what-exactly-makes-lyrical-nanoha-more-adult-oriented/|last=Oppliger|first=John|title=Ask John: What Exactly Makes Lyrical Nanoha More Adult Oriented?|publisher=[[AnimeNation]]|date=Mar 3, 2012|accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parmigianino 003b.jpg|thumb|230px|In [[Parmigianino]]'s ''[[Madonna with the Long Neck]]'' (1534–40), Mannerism makes itself known by elongated proportions, highly stylized poses, and lack of clear perspective.]]

'''Mannerism''', also known as '''Late Renaissance''',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=IFMohetegAcC&amp;pg=PT330&amp;dq=mannerism+late+renaissance&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR39KL6P_XAhVXOMAKHTUJAc0Q6AEILjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=mannerism%20late%20renaissance&amp;f=false A World history of architecture] and [https://books.google.it/books?id=nHzqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=mannerism+late+renaissance&amp;dq=mannerism+late+renaissance&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjR39KL6P_XAhVXOMAKHTUJAc0Q6AEIJDAA Mannerism: the painting and style of the Late Renaissance]&lt;/ref&gt; is a style in [[European art]] that emerged in the later years of the Italian [[High Renaissance]] around 1520, spreading by about 1530 and lasting until about the end of the 16th century in Italy, when the [[Baroque]] style largely replaced it. [[Northern Mannerism]] continued into the early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg 1971, 483.&lt;!--If this statement can be found in the third edition of 1993, it would be preferable to cite from that edition, which is cited elsewhere in this same article.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Painting style|Stylistically]], Mannerism encompasses a variety of approaches influenced by, and reacting to, the harmonious ideals associated with artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], and early [[Michelangelo]]. Where High Renaissance art emphasizes proportion, balance, and ideal beauty, Mannerism exaggerates such qualities, often resulting in compositions that are asymmetrical or unnaturally elegant.&lt;ref name= "ReferenceC "&gt;Gombrich 1995, {{Page needed|date=April 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The style is notable for its intellectual sophistication as well as its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic) qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/zino/hd_zino.htm |title=Mannerism: Bronzino (1503–1572) and his Contemporaries|publisher= Metropolitan Museum of Art|date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It favors compositional tension and instability rather than the balance and clarity of earlier Renaissance painting. Mannerism in literature and music is notable for its highly florid style and intellectual sophistication.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Art and Illusion, E. H. Gombrich, {{ISBN|9780691070001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of Mannerism and the phases within it continue to be a subject of debate among art historians. For example, some scholars have applied the label to certain early modern forms of literature (especially poetry) and music of the 16th and 17th centuries. The term is also used to refer to some late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] painters working in northern Europe from about 1500 to 1530, especially the [[Antwerp Mannerism|Antwerp Mannerists]]—a group unrelated to the Italian movement. Mannerism has also been applied by analogy to the [[Classical Latin|Silver Age of Latin literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsconnected.org/resource/93691/the-mannerist-style-and-the-lamentation|title=the-mannerist-style |publisher=www.artsconnected.org|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
[[File:Laocoon Pio-Clementino Inv1059-1064-1067.jpg|thumb|230px|Mannerism role-model: ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'', an ancient sculpture, rediscovered in 1506; now in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. The artists of Mannerism greatly admired this piece of sculpture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;]]

The word ''mannerism'' derives from the Italian ''maniera'', meaning "style" or "manner". Like the English word "style", ''maniera'' can either indicate a specific type of style (a beautiful style, an abrasive style) or indicate an absolute that needs no qualification (someone "has style").&lt;ref&gt;
John Shearman, “Maniera as an Aesthetic Ideal”, in Cheney 2004, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second edition of his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'' (1568), [[Giorgio Vasari]] used ''maniera'' in three different contexts:  to discuss an artist's manner or method of working; to describe a personal or group style, such as the term ''maniera greca'' to refer to the Byzantine style or simply to the ''maniera'' of Michelangelo; and to affirm a positive judgment of artistic quality.&lt;ref&gt;Cheney 1997, 17.&lt;!--The pagination may be different in the 1997 edition from the 2004 one found as the main entry in the reference list. Be sure the right one is being cited. Ideally, only one edition should be cited unless there is information in the earlier missing in the later edition.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari was also a Mannerist artist, and he described the period in which he worked as "la maniera moderna", or the "modern style".&lt;ref&gt;Briganti 1961, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; James V. Mirollo describes how "bella maniera" poets attempted to surpass in virtuosity the sonnets of Petrarch.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mirollo 1984, {{Page needed|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of "bella maniera" suggests that artists who were thus inspired looked to copying and bettering their predecessors, rather than confronting nature directly. In essence, "bella maniera" utilized the best from a number of source materials, synthesizing it into something new.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As a stylistic label, "Mannerism" is not easily defined. It was used by Swiss historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] and popularized by German [[Art history|art historians]] in the early 20th century to categorize the seemingly uncategorizable art of the Italian 16th century — art that was no longer found to exhibit the harmonious and rational approaches associated with the High Renaissance. “High Renaissance” connoted a period distinguished by harmony, grandeur and the revival of classical antiquity. The term Mannerist was redefined in 1967 by [[John Shearman]]&lt;ref&gt;Shearman 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; following the exhibition of Mannerist paintings organised by [[Fritz Grossmann]] at [[Manchester Art Gallery|Manchester City Art Gallery]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Grossmann 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The label “Mannerism” was used during the 16th century to comment on social behaviour and to convey a refined virtuoso quality or to signify a certain technique.
However, for later writers, such as the 17th-century Gian Pietro Bellori, "la maniera" was a derogatory term for the perceived decline of art after Raphael, especially in the 1530s and 1540s.&lt;ref&gt;Smyth 1962, 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 19th century on, art historians have commonly used the term to describe art that follows Renaissance classicism and precedes the Baroque.

Yet historians differ as to whether Mannerism is a style, a movement, or a period; and while the term remains controversial it is still commonly used to identify European art and culture of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;

By the end of the High Renaissance, young artists experienced a crisis:&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; it seemed that everything that could be achieved was already achieved. No more difficulties, technical or otherwise, remained to be solved. The detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, physiognomy and the way in which humans register emotion in expression and gesture, the innovative use of the human form in figurative composition, the use of the subtle gradation of tone, all had reached near perfection. The young artists needed to find a new goal, and they sought new approaches.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} At this point Mannerism started to emerge.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The new style developed between 1510 and 1520 either in Florence,&lt;ref name="friedlaender"&gt;Friedländer 1965,{{Page needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in Rome, or in both cities simultaneously.&lt;ref name="freedberg175"&gt;Freedberg 1993, 175–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins and role models===
This period has been described as a "natural extension"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; of the art of [[Andrea del Sarto]], Michelangelo, and Raphael. Michelangelo developed his own style at an early age, a deeply original one which was greatly admired at first, then often copied and imitated by other artists of the era.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; One of the qualities most admired by his contemporaries was his ''terribilità'', a sense of awe-inspiring grandeur, and subsequent artists attempted to imitate it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Other artists learned Michelangelo's impassioned and highly personal style by copying the works of the master, a standard way that students learned to paint and sculpt. His [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] provided examples for them to follow, in particular his representation of collected figures often called ''[[ignudi]]'' and of the [[Libyan Sibyl]], his [[vestibule (Architecture)|vestibule]] to the [[Laurentian Library]], the figures on his [[Medici]] tombs, and above all his ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|Last Judgment]]''. The later Michelangelo was one of the great role models of Mannerism.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Young artists broke in to his house and stole drawings from him.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Giorgio Vasari, Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects'', Giorgio Vasari noted that Michelangelo stated once: "Those who are followers can never pass by whom they follow".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

====The competitive spirit====

The competitive spirit was cultivated by patrons who encouraged sponsored artists to emphasize virtuosic technique and to compete with one another for commissions. It drove artists to look for new approaches and dramatically illuminated scenes, elaborate clothes and compositions, elongated proportions, highly stylized poses, and a lack of clear perspective. Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were each given a commission by Gonfaloniere [[Piero Soderini]] to decorate a wall in the Hall of Five Hundred in Florence. These two artists were set to paint side by side and compete against each other, fueling the incentive to be as innovative as possible.

===Early mannerism===
[[File:Jacopo Pontormo 004.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Jacopo Pontormo]], ''Entombment'', 1528; Santa Felicità, Florence]]
The early Mannerists in Florence—especially the students of [[Andrea del Sarto]] such as [[Jacopo da Pontormo]] and [[Rosso Fiorentino]] who are notable for elongated forms, precariously balanced poses, a collapsed perspective, irrational settings, and theatrical lighting. [[Parmigianino]] (a student of [[Antonio da Correggio|Correggio]]) and [[Giulio Romano]] (Raphael’s head assistant) were moving in similarly stylized aesthetic directions in Rome.  These artists had matured under the influence of the High Renaissance, and their style has been characterized as a reaction to or exaggerated extension of it. Instead of studying nature directly, younger artists began studying Hellenistic sculpture and paintings of masters past. Therefore, this style is often identified as "anti-classical”,&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer 1965,{{Page needed|date=September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; yet at the time it was considered a natural progression from the High Renaissance. The earliest experimental phase of Mannerism, known for its "anti-classical" forms, lasted until about 1540 or 1550.&lt;ref name="freedberg175" /&gt; Marcia B. Hall, professor of art history at Temple University, notes in her book ''After Raphael'' that Raphael's premature death marked the beginning of Mannerism in Rome.

In past analyses, it has been noted that mannerism arose in the early 16th century contemporaneously with a number of other social, scientific, religious and political movements such as the [[Heliocentrism|Copernican model]], the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]], and the [[Protestant Reformation]]'s increasing challenge to the power of the Catholic Church. Because of this, the style's elongated forms and distorted forms were once interpreted as a reaction to the idealized compositions prevalent in High Renaissance art.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;Manfred Wundram, "Mannerism," Grove Art Online. Oxford University Press, [accessed 23 April 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation for the radical stylistic shift c. 1520 has fallen out of scholarly favor, though early Mannerist art is still sharply contrasted with High Renaissance conventions; the accessibility and balance achieved by Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens|School of Athens]]'' no longer seemed to interest young artists.

===High maniera===
The second period of Mannerism is commonly differentiated{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} from the earlier, so-called "anti-classical" phase.
Subsequent mannerists stressed intellectual conceits and artistic virtuosity, features that have led later critics to accuse them of working in an unnatural and affected "manner" (''maniera''). Maniera artists looked to their older contemporary Michelangelo as their principal model; theirs was an art imitating art, rather than an art imitating nature. Art historian [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]] argues that the intellectualizing aspect of maniera art involves expecting its audience to notice and appreciate this visual reference—a familiar figure in an unfamiliar setting enclosed between "unseen, but felt, quotation marks".&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; The height of artifice is the Maniera painter's penchant for deliberately misappropriating a quotation. [[Agnolo Bronzino]] and [[Giorgio Vasari]] exemplify this strain of Maniera that lasted from about 1530 to 1580. Based largely at courts and in intellectual circles around Europe, Maniera art couples exaggerated elegance with exquisite attention to surface and detail: porcelain-skinned figures recline in an even, tempered light, acknowledging the viewer with a cool glance, if they make eye contact at all. The Maniera subject rarely displays much emotion, and for this reason works exemplifying this trend are often called 'cold' or 'aloof.' This is typical of the so-called "stylish style" or ''Maniera'' in its maturity.&lt;ref&gt;
Shearman 1967, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread of mannerism==
[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Surrey 1546.jpg|thumb|230px|English Mannerism: [[Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey]], 1546, a rare English Mannerist portrait by a Flemish immigrant]]

The cities Rome, Florence, and Mantua were Mannerist centers in Italy. Venetian painting pursued a different course, represented by [[Titian]] in his long career.  A number of the earliest Mannerist artists who had been working in Rome during the 1520s fled the city after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527. As they spread out across the continent in search of employment, their style was disseminated throughout Italy and Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Briganti 1961, 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; The result was the first international artistic style since the [[Gothic art|Gothic]].&lt;ref&gt;Briganti 1961, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Other parts of Northern Europe did not have the advantage of such direct contact with Italian artists, but the Mannerist style made its presence felt through prints and illustrated books. European rulers, among others, purchased Italian works, while northern European artists continued to travel to Italy, helping to spread the Mannerist style. Individual Italian artists working in the North gave birth to a movement known as the [[Northern Mannerism]]. [[Francis I of France]], for example, was presented with [[Bronzino]]'s ''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]''. The style waned in Italy after 1580, as a new generation of artists, including the [[Accademia degli Incamminati|Carracci]] brothers, [[Caravaggio]] and [[Cigoli]], revived naturalism. [[Walter Friedlaender]] identified this period as "anti-mannerism", just as the early mannerists were "anti-classical" in their reaction away from the aesthetic values of the High Renaissance&lt;ref&gt;Friedländer 1957, {{Page needed|date=September 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and today the Carracci brothers and Caravaggio are agreed to have begun the transition to Baroque-style painting which was dominant by 1600.

Outside of Italy, however, Mannerism continued into the 17th century. In France, where Rosso traveled to work for the court at [[School of Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], it is known as the "[[Henry II style]]" and had a particular impact on architecture. Other important continental centers of [[Northern Mannerism]] include the court of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] in [[Prague]], as well as [[Haarlem]] and [[Antwerp]]. Mannerism as a stylistic category is less frequently applied to [[England|English]] visual and decorative arts, where native labels such as "[[Elizabethan]]" and "[[Jacobean era|Jacobean]]" are more commonly applied. Seventeenth-century Artisan Mannerism is one exception, applied to architecture that relies on pattern books rather than on existing precedents in Continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson 1983, 157–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular note is the Flemish influence at Fontainebleau that combined the eroticism of the French style with an early version of the vanitas tradition that would dominate seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish painting. Prevalent at this time was the "pittore vago," a description of painters from the north who entered the workshops in France and Italy to create a truly international style.

==Sculpture==
As in painting, early Italian Mannerist sculpture was very largely an attempt to find an original style that would top the achievement of the [[High Renaissance]], which in sculpture essentially meant Michelangelo, and much of the struggle to achieve this was played out in commissions to fill other places in the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in Florence, next to [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]''. [[Baccio Bandinelli]] took over the project of ''[[Hercules and Cacus]]'' from the master himself, but it was little more popular then than it is now, and maliciously compared by [[Benvenuto Cellini]] to "a sack of melons", though it had a long-lasting effect in apparently introducing relief panels on the [[pedestal]] of statues.  Like other works of his and other Mannerists it removes far more of the original block than Michelangelo would have done.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 179–182&lt;/ref&gt;  Cellini's bronze ''[[Perseus with the head of Medusa]]'' is certainly a masterpiece, designed with eight angles of view, another Mannerist characteristic, and artificially stylized in comparison with the ''David''s of Michelangelo and Donatello.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 183–187&lt;/ref&gt; Originally a goldsmith, his famous gold and enamel [[Cellini Salt Cellar|Salt Cellar]] (1543) was his first sculpture, and shows his talent at its best.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;

Small bronze figures for collector's [[Cabinet (room)|cabinets]], often mythological subjects with nudes, were a popular Renaissance form at which [[Giambologna]], originally [[Flemish]] but based in Florence, excelled in the later part of the century. He also created life-size sculptures, of which two entered the collection in the Piazza della Signoria. He and his followers devised elegant elongated examples of the ''[[figura serpentinata]]'', often of two intertwined figures, that were interesting from all angles.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, 194–202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early theorists==
[[File:Pietro Francavilla - Apollo Victorious over the Python - Walters 27302.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Pietro Francavilla]], ''Apollo Victorious over the Python'', 1591. [[The Walters Art Museum]]]]

===Giorgio Vasari===
[[Giorgio Vasari]]'s opinions about the art of painting emerge in the praise he bestows on fellow artists in his multi-volume ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'': he believed that excellence in painting demanded refinement, richness of invention (''invenzione''), expressed through virtuoso technique (''maniera''), and wit and study that appeared in the finished work, all criteria that emphasized the artist's intellect and the patron's sensibility. The artist was now no longer just a trained member of a local Guild of St Luke. Now he took his place at court alongside scholars, poets, and humanists, in a climate that fostered an appreciation for elegance and complexity. The coat-of-arms of Vasari's [[Medici]] patrons appears at the top of his portrait, quite as if it were the artist's own. The framing of the woodcut image of [[Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'' would be called "[[Jacobean era|Jacobean]]" in an English-speaking milieu. In it, Michelangelo's Medici tombs inspire the anti-architectural "architectural" features at the top, the papery pierced frame, the satyr nudes at the base. As a mere frame it is extravagant: Mannerist, in short.

===Gian Paolo Lomazzo===
Another literary figure from the period is [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]], who produced two works—one practical and one metaphysical—that helped define the Mannerist artist's self-conscious relation to his art. His ''Trattato dell'arte della pittura, scoltura et architettura'' (Milan, 1584) is in part a guide to contemporary concepts of [[decorum]], which the Renaissance inherited in part from Antiquity but Mannerism elaborated upon. Lomazzo's systematic codification of aesthetics, which typifies the more formalized and academic approaches typical of the later 16th century, emphasized a consonance between the functions of interiors and the kinds of painted and sculpted decors that would be suitable. Iconography, often convoluted and abstruse, is a more prominent element in the Mannerist styles. His less practical and more metaphysical ''Idea del tempio della pittura'' (''The ideal temple of painting'', Milan, 1590) offers a description along the lines of the "four temperaments" theory of human nature and personality, defining the role of individuality in judgment and artistic invention.

==Some Mannerist artists==
[[File:Angelo Bronzino - Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time - National Gallery, London.jpg|thumb|230px|High Mannerism: ''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]'' by [[Bronzino]], c. 1545; [[National Gallery|National Gallery, London]].]]

The Dragon seems of sino-oriental influence.]]

===Jacopo da Pontormo===
[[Pontormo|Jacopo da Pontormo]]'s ''Joseph in Egypt'' features what would in the Renaissance have been considered incongruous colors and an incoherent handling of time and space.

===Rosso Fiorentino and the School of Fontainebleau===
[[Rosso Fiorentino]], who had been a fellow pupil of Pontormo in the studio of [[Andrea del Sarto]], in 1530 brought Florentine mannerism to [[Fontainebleau]], where he became one of the founders of French 16th-century Mannerism, popularly known as the "[[School of Fontainebleau]]".

The examples of a rich and hectic decorative style at Fontainebleau further disseminated the Italian style through the medium of [[engraving]]s, to [[Antwerp]] and from there throughout Northern Europe from London to Poland. Mannerist design was extended to luxury goods like silver and carved furniture. A sense of tense, controlled emotion expressed in elaborate symbolism and [[allegory]], and an ideal of female beauty characterized by elongated proportions are features of this style.

===Agnolo Bronzino===
Mannerist portraits by [[Bronzino|Agnolo Bronzino]] are distinguished by a serene elegance and meticulous attention to detail. As a result, Bronzino's sitters have been said to project an aloofness and marked emotional distance from the viewer. There is also a virtuosic concentration on capturing the precise pattern and sheen of rich textiles.

===Alessandro Allori===
[[Alessandro Allori]]'s (1535–1607) ''Susanna and the Elders'' (''below'') is distinguished by latent eroticism and consciously brilliant still life detail, in a crowded, contorted composition.

===Tintoretto===
[[Tintoretto]]'s ''Last Supper'' (below) focuses on light and motion, bringing the image to dramatic life.  Unlike more traditional views of the Last Supper, Tintoretto depicts Heaven opening up into the room, and the [[angel]]s looking on in awe, in line with the old Catholic maxim that "If the angels were capable of envy, they would envy the Eucharist."

===El Greco===
[[El Greco]] attempted to express [[religious]] emotion with exaggerated traits. After the realistic depiction of the human form and the mastery of perspective achieved in high Renaissance Classicism, some artists started to deliberately distort proportions in disjointed, irrational space for emotional and artistic effect. El Greco still is a deeply original artist. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  Key aspects of Mannerism in El Greco include the jarring "acid" palette, elongated and tortured anatomy, irrational perspective and light, and obscure and troubling iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg29/gg29-over1.html |title=National Gallery of Art – El Greco |publisher=Nga.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grec/hd_grec.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art El Greco (Domenikos Theotokopoulos) (1541–1614) |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benvenuto Cellini===

[[Benvenuto Cellini]] created the [[Cellini Salt Cellar]] of gold and enamel in 1540 featuring [[Poseidon]] and [[Amphitrite]] (water and earth) placed in uncomfortable positions and with elongated proportions. It is considered a masterpiece of Mannerist sculpture.

===Joachim Wtewael===
[[Joachim Wtewael]] (1566–1638) continued to paint in a Northern Mannerist style until the end of his life, ignoring the arrival of the Baroque, and making him perhaps the last significant Mannerist artist still to be working.  His subjects included large scenes with still life in the manner of [[Pieter Aertsen]], and mythological scenes, many small [[cabinet painting]]s beautifully executed on copper, and most featuring nudity.

===Giuseppe Arcimboldo===
[[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] (also spelled ''Arcimboldi'') is known for his portraits contrived from a [[still life]] composition

==Mannerist architecture==
Mannerist architecture was characterized by visual trickery and unexpected elements that challenged the renaissance norms.&lt;ref name=vanda&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/style-guide-mannerism/ |title=Style Guide: Mannerism  |date= |website= |publisher=Victoria and Albert |access-date=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flemish artists, many of whom had traveled to Italy and were influenced by Mannerist developments there, were responsible for the spread of Mannerist trends into Europe north of the Alps, including into the realm of architecture. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Art|last=Wundram|first=Manfred|publisher=Grove|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period, architects experimented with using architectural forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style, and a pioneer at the [[Laurentian Library]], was [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vSfOCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2&amp;dq=michelangelo+pioneered+mannerist+style#v=onepage&amp;q=michelangelo%20pioneered%20mannerist%20style&amp;f=false|page=Foreward|nopp=true|title=Michelangelo: 240 Colour Plates|isbn=9788892577916|last1=Peitcheva|first1=Maria|date=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is credited with inventing the [[giant order]], a large pilaster that stretches from the bottom to the top of a façade.&lt;ref&gt;{{verify source|date=July 2014}}{{Citation | title= Pilaster Play|author= [[Mark Jarzombek]]| journal=  Thresholds | url= http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/thresholds28.pdf | volume= 28 (Winter 2005)|  pages=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this in his design for the [[Campidoglio]] in Rome.

Prior to the 20th century, the term ''Mannerism'' had negative connotations, but it is now used to describe the historical period in more general non-judgmental terms.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Hauser. ''Mannerism: The Crisis of the Renaissance and the Origins of Modern Art''. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,1965).&lt;/ref&gt;  Mannerist architecture has also been used to describe a trend in the 1960s and 1970s that involved breaking the norms of modernist architecture while at the same time recognizing their existence.&lt;ref name=venturi/&gt; Defining mannerist in this context, architect and author [[Robert Venturi]] wrote "Mannerism for architecture of our time that acknowledges conventional order rather than original expression but breaks the conventional order to accommodate complexity and contradiction and thereby engages ambiguity unambiguously." &lt;ref name=venturi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://designtheory.fiu.edu/readings/venturi_architecture_as_signs.pdf |title=Architecture as Signs and Systems |last1=Venturi |first1=Robert |access-date=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance examples===

An example of mannerist architecture is the [[Villa Farnese]] at [[Caprarola]].&lt;ref&gt;Coffin David, ''The Villa in the Life of Renaissance Rome'', Princeton University Press, 1979: 281–85&lt;/ref&gt; in the rugged country side outside of [[Rome]]. The proliferation of engravers during the 16th century spread Mannerist styles more quickly than any previous styles.

Dense with ornament of "Roman" detailing, the display doorway at Colditz Castle exemplifies this northern style, characteristically applied as an isolated "set piece" against unpretentious vernacular walling.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

From the late 1560s onwards, many buildings in [[Valletta]], the new capital city of [[Malta]], were designed by the architect [[Girolamo Cassar]] in the Mannerist style. Such buildings include [[St. John's Co-Cathedral]], the [[Grandmaster's Palace (Valletta)|Grandmaster's Palace]] and the seven original [[Langue (Knights Hospitaller)#Valletta|auberges]]. Many of Cassar's buildings were modified over the years, especially in the [[Baroque]] period. However, a few buildings, such as [[Auberge d'Aragon]] and the exterior of St. John's Co-Cathedral, still retain most of Cassar's original Mannerist design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellul |first1=Michael |title=In search of Girolamo Cassar: An unpublished manuscript at the State Archives of Lucca |journal=Melita Historica |date=2004 |volume=XIV |issue=1 |page=37 |url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14(2004-07)/MH.14(2004)1/02.pdf |issn=1021-6952 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313191703/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14%282004-07%29/MH.14%282004%291/02.pdf |archivedate=13 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mannerism in literature and music==

{{See also|Metaphysical poets}}
In English literature, Mannerism is commonly identified with the qualities of the "Metaphysical" poets of whom the most famous is [[John Donne]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The witty sally of a Baroque writer, [[John Dryden]], against the verse of Donne in the previous generation, affords a concise contrast between Baroque and Mannerist aims in the arts:

{{quote|He affects the metaphysics, not only in his satires but in his amorous verses, ''where nature only'' should reign; and ''perplexes the minds'' of the fair sex with ''nice''&lt;ref&gt;'Nice' in the sense of 'finely reasoned.'&lt;/ref&gt; ''speculations'' of philosophy when he should ''engage their hearts'' and entertain them with the softnesses of love.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1957"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gardner, Helen |title=Metaphysical Poets |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zS_EXPFEtKwC&amp;q=dryden#v=snippet&amp;q=dryden&amp;f=false |publisher=Oxford University Press, London |year=1957 |accessdate=2014-08-15|isbn=9780140420388 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|15}} (italics added)}}

The rich musical possibilities in the poetry of the late 16th and early 17th centuries provided an attractive basis for the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], which quickly rose to prominence as the pre-eminent musical form in Italian musical culture, as discussed by [[Tim Carter (musicologist)|Tim Carter]]:

{{quote|The madrigal, particularly in its aristocratic guise, was obviously a vehicle for the ‘stylish style’ of Mannerism, with poets and musicians revelling in witty conceits and other visual, verbal and musical tricks to delight the connoisseur.&lt;ref&gt;Carter 1991, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The word Mannerism has also been used to describe the style of highly florid and [[counterpoint|contrapuntally]] complex [[polyphonic]] music made in France in the late 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;Apel 1946–47, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This period is now usually referred to as the ''[[ars subtilior]]''.

===Mannerism and theatre===
''The Early Commedia dell'Arte (1550–1621): The Mannerist Context'' by Paul Castagno discusses Mannerism's effect on the contemporary professional theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Castagno 1992,{{Page needed|date=June 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Castagno's was the first study to define a theatrical form as Mannerist, employing the vocabulary of Mannerism and maniera to discuss the typification, exaggerated, and effetto meraviglioso of the comici dell'arte. See Part II of the above book for a full discussion of Mannerist characteristics in the commedia dell'arte. The study is largely iconographic, presenting a pictorial evidence that many of the artists who painted or printed commedia images were in fact, coming from the workshops of the day, heavily ensconced in the maniera tradition.

The preciosity in [[Jacques Callot]]'s minute engravings seem to belie a much larger scale of action. Callot's ''Balli di Sfessania'' (literally, dance of the buttocks) celebrates the commedia's blatant eroticism, with protruding phalli, spears posed with the anticipation of a comic ream, and grossly exaggerated masks that mix the bestial with human. The eroticism of the innamorate (lovers) including the baring of breasts, or excessive veiling, was quite in vogue in the paintings and engravings from the second school at Fontainebleau, particularly those that detect a Franco-Flemish influence. Castagno demonstrates iconographic linkages between genre painting and the figures of the commedia dell'arte that demonstrate how this theatrical form was embedded within the cultural traditions of the late cinquecento.&lt;ref&gt;Castagno 1994, {{Page needed|date=June 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Commedia dell'arte, ''disegno interno'', and the ''discordia concors''====
Important corollaries exist between the ''disegno interno'', which substituted for the ''disegno esterno'' (external design) in mannerist painting. This notion of projecting a deeply subjective view as superseding nature or established principles (perspective, for example), in essence, the emphasis away from the object to its subject, now emphasizing execution, displays of virtuosity, or unique techniques. This inner vision is at the heart of commedia performance. For example, in the moment of improvisation the actor expresses his virtuosity without heed to formal boundaries, decorum, unity, or text. Arlecchino became emblematic of the mannerist ''discordia concors'' (the union of opposites), at one moment he would be gentle and kind, then, on a dime, become a thief violently acting out with his batte. Arlecchino could be graceful in movement, only in the next beat, to clumsily trip over his feet. Freed from the external rules, the actor celebrated the evanescence of the moment; much the way Cellini would dazzle his patrons by draping his sculptures, unveiling them with lighting effects and a sense of the marvelous. The presentation of the object became as important as the object itself.

=== Neo-Mannerism ===
According to art critic [[Jerry Saltz]], "Neo-Mannerism" (new Mannerism) is among several clichés that are "squeezing the life out of the art world".&lt;ref name="saltz"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Jerry Saltz on Art’s Insidious New Cliché: Neo-Mannerism |last=Saltz |first=Jerry |authorlink=Jerry Saltz |url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/jerry-saltz-on-arts-insidious-new-clich.html |publisher=Vulture |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neo-Mannerism describes art of the 21st century that is turned out by students whose academic teachers "have scared [them] into being pleasingly meek, imitative, and ordinary".&lt;ref name="saltz" /&gt;

'''Marc Rosenberg''' is an American screenwriter and producer, with professional roots in Australia. Rosenberg currently splits his time between Los Angeles and Sydney,&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110706112121/http://www.screenhub.com.au/news/shownewsarticleG.asp?newsID=35087 Interview with Marc Rosenberg in Screen Hub&lt;/ref&gt; having taught screenwriting and film production in the U.S., India, Norway, China and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;https://cce.sydney.edu.au/tutor/2906&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg has contributed to ''Film International Magazine'' and written a screenwriting guide, ''The Screenplay Tree: Story Structure Made Easy.''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/SCREENPLAY-TREE-Structure-Annotated-Script-ebook/dp/B07D72MX3F/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1527328000&amp;sr=1-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was raised in Houston, Texas, and graduated from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] with a degree in Government. Following graduation, he hitchhiked through Europe and Asia, settling for a brief time in London, where he worked as an estate agent. He later spent a year living on [[kibbutz]] in Israel, and then moved to Sydney, New South Wales, where he was accepted into the Writers-in-Residence program at the prestigious [[Australian Film Television and Radio School]]. There, he studied with fellow students such as [[Jane Campion]], [[Alex Proyas]], [[P.J. Hogan]] and Andrew Lesnie.

==Career==
After graduating, Rosenberg was invited by acclaimed director [[Phillip Noyce]] to collaborate on the screenplay ''[[Heatwave (film)|Heatwave]]'', which starred [[Judy Davis]]. Rosenberg went on to write screenplays for such feature films as ''[[Dingo (film)|Dingo]]'' (starring Miles Davis), ''[[The Nesting (film)|The Nesting]]'' (aka ''The Serpent's Lair''), ''Incident at Raven's Gate, Australie'' (starring Jeremy Irons) and ''[[December Boys]]'' (starring Daniel Radcliffe). Rosenberg was nominated for an [[Australian Film Institute]] (AFI) Best Picture award for ''Dingo'', for which he also received a prestigious AWGIE award from the [[Australian Writers' Guild]], as well as the New South Wales State Literary Award. He also received an AWGIE for Best Feature Film Adaptation in 2007 for ''December Boys''.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20081209153337/http://wip.warnerbros.com/decemberboys/content/docs/DecemberBoys_prodnotes.pdf Production notes distributed by Warner Brothers for the film ''December Boys''&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenberg finished shooting the suspense-thriller ''Elevator'', which he wrote and produced. The film, which is about people trapped in a New York elevator with a terrorist, features actors [[John Getz]], [[Shirley Knight]], [[Joey Slotnick]], [[Devin Ratray]], [[Waleed Zuaiter]], [[Anita Briem]], [[Tehmina Sunny]], [[Christopher Backus]], [[Michael Mercurio]], Amanda Pace and Rachel Pace. It is Rosenberg's second film to be shot in the U.S. It was released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://movies.broadwayworld.com/article/Shirley_Knight_Begins_Production_for_ELEVATOR_20100930 TalkMoviesWorld.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Maughanasilly Stone Row was erected during the [[Atlantic Bronze Age|Bronze Age]], c. 1600–1500 BC, making it contemporary with the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Indo-Aryan migrations]] and the rise of [[Shang dynasty|Shang China]], the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] and [[Mycenaean Greece]]. It was used for [[archaeoastronomical]] purposes, for making observations of [[lunar standstill]]s and [[equinoxes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://roaringwaterjournal.com/tag/maughanasilly-stone-row/|title=Maughanasilly Stone Row - Roaringwater Journal|website=roaringwaterjournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=Tt0Va7OotD4C&amp;pg=PA206&amp;dq=Maughanasilly&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDzqPUu7LXAhVDLMAKHSBrCT0Q6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Maughanasilly&amp;f=false|title=Archaeoastronomy in the Old World|first=D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3635">'''Moderate Muslim''' is a label used within [[counterterrorism]] discourse as the complement of "[[Islamic extremism]]", implying that the support of [[Islamic terrorism]] is the characteristic of a "radical" faction within Islam, and that there is a "moderate" faction of Muslims who denounce terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Khan, ed.|first1=M. A. Muqtedar| authorlink = M. A. Muqtedar Khan|title=Debating Moderate Islam: The Geopolitics of Islam and the West|date=2007|publisher=University of Utah Press|location=Salt Lake City, UT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Lorenzo G. Vidino]] describes the term as "inherently controversial", and scholars have argued that Muslim populations predictably find the "moderate Muslim" label offensive. Cherney and Murphy argue that the categorisations of moderate/extremist are not neutral, and that their widespread deployment "deprives Muslims of the agency to define the parameters of the debate around counterterrorism and also the terms of reference through which they are labelled as either for or against terrorism." Although some Muslims do employ the use of such language, it is seen by others as further stigmatising Muslim communities and Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=23704 |last1=Corbett |first1=Rosemary R. |title=Making Moderate Islam: Sufism, Service, and the "Ground Zero Mosque" Controversy |publisher=Stanford University Press |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some consider the "moderate Muslim" label offensive, as they believe that it implies ordinary Islam is not inherently peaceful.&lt;ref name="droptheterm"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manzoor|first1=Sarfraz|title=Can we drop the term ‘moderate Muslim’?

'''Nja Mahdaoui''', (born in 1937) is a Tunisian artist known for his use of calligraphy as a graphic art form. He has often been described as a ‘choreographer of letters.'&lt;ref name=molka&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahdaoui|first1=Molka|title=Nja Mahdaoui|url=http://www.nja-mahdaoui.com/|website=Nja Mahdaoui|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Nja Mahdaoui was born in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]] in 1937.&lt;ref name=spring&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spring|first1=Christopher|title=Angaza Africa: African Art Now|date=28 November 2008|publisher=Laurence King|location=London|pages=178–181|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He initially studied painting and art history at [[Carthage National Museum]],&lt;ref name=vernoit&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vernoit|first1=S.J.|title=Mahdaoui, Nja|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T053180|website=Grove Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
but was later, encouraged by the Director of the Italian Cultural Centre in Tunis, studied painting and philosophy at the Santa Andrea Academy in Rome (1966-68).&lt;ref name=spring /&gt; 
He later moved to Paris to go to Cité Internationale des Arts, where he attended courses at the [[École du Louvre]].&lt;ref name=vernoit /&gt;
Mahdaoui returned to Tunisia in 1977 and currently lives and works there.&lt;ref name=meem&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists Resource|url=http://www.meemartgallery.com/art_exhibiting.php?id=2|website=Meem Gallery|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Mahdaoui began his career as an abstract painter in the 1960s, then continued by experimenting with Arabic calligraphy.&lt;ref name=twair&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Twair|first1=Pat McDonnell|title=World-Class Tunisian Artists Exhibited At Ne Sahara Gallery In L.A. Suburb|journal=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|date=2011|pages=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mahdaoui has tried various traditional and experimental media. He produced his first paintings on parchment in 1972, he became interested in weaving and carpet production in 1979 and he began to paint on animal skins and on the human body in 1980.&lt;ref name=vernoit /&gt;
Today he is known as the "inventor of abstract calligraphy," since his designs resemble Arabic letters, but have no literal meaning. When asked about his style Mahdaoui said, "I use fragmented and distorted letters to reject valuing each character." &lt;ref name= twair /&gt;
He started using his own personal '[[calligram]]s' on various mediums such as: canvas, papyrus, sculpture, aluminum, brass, drum, textile, embroidery, tapestry, ceramic, wood, jewelry, stained steel glass, planes, etc.&lt;ref name=molka /&gt; On account of his use of calligraphy in art, he is said to be part of the Hurufiyah art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahdaoui is of a generation of Arab artists who studied abroad but sought inspiration from their traditional roots.&lt;ref name=meem /&gt; Mahdaoui focused on the poetic quality of Arabic text, and invented a graphic style involving calligraphic works.&lt;ref name=richards&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Paul|title=Africa|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T000675pg26|website=Grover Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose Issa, a curator, has described his work saying, "Mahdaoui is careful not to emphasize the meaning of words but stresses instead the visual effect of compositions. His 'calligrams evoke infinite pleasures in rhythms, fast or slow, born from tension of the wrist, somewhat in the manner of a melodic flow, rising and fading away".&lt;ref name=geers&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geers|first1=Kendell|last2=Ross|first2=Doran H. Ross|title=africa95: Many Stories about the Art of a Continent|journal=African Arts|date=Summer 1996|volume=29|issue=3|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, he was also selected by [[Gulf Air]] to design the external decoration of its fleet for the airline's fiftieth anniversary.&lt;ref name= meem /&gt; He has also created monumental stained-glass windows for public buildings in the United Arab Emirates.&lt;ref name= twair /&gt; 
Mahdaoui followed his love of music, costume, and performance by using different media to apply his 'calligrams' to a wide range of objects such as large denim hangings, musicians' costumes, and a bass drum.&lt;ref name=spring2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spring|first1=Christopher|last2=Barley|first2=Nigel|last3=Hudson|first3=Julie|title=The Sainsbury African Galleries at the British Museum|journal=African Arts|date=Autumn 2001|volume=34|issue=3|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bass drum was created in 1998 with wood and given calligraphic embellishments by Mahdaoui.&lt;ref name=spring2 /&gt; When asked about this piece Mahdaoui said,"This drum, transformed into a silent sculpture, has temporarily ceased to be an instrument; it simply exists. Its cultural function - as a catalyst to the senses articulated through formal and improvised melody - has been interrupted. More importantly, it has renounced its particular voice as part of a collective artistic performance. Instead, with its multiplicity of resonances, it has become a dynamic symbol of cultural pluralism, a kind of 'total art' to which people throughout the world can respond in a myriad different ways."&lt;ref name=spring /&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Mahdaoui has participated in both solo and group exhibitions worldwide. His work can be found in private and public international collections, including:

Museum of Modern Art, Tunis

Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad
 
[[British Museum]], London

[[Smithsonian Museum]], Washington, DC

'''Charles Octavius Swinnerton Morgan''' [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]], [[Justice of the Peace|JP]], [[Royal Society|FRS]], [[Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]] (15 September 1803 – 5 August 1888), known as '''Octavius Morgan''', was a British politician, historian and antiquary. He was a significant benefactor to the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/prehistory_and_europe/history_of_the_collection.aspx History of the collection], British Museum, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==
Morgan was born on 15 September 1803. He was the fourth son of [[Sir Charles Morgan, 2nd Baronet]], of Tredegar Park, Monmouthshire, by his wife Mary (née Stoney). [[Charles Rodney Morgan]] and [[Charles Morgan, 1st Baron Tredegar]], were his elder brothers. He was educated at [[Westminster School]] in London and at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], gaining an M.A. in 1832.

==Career==
Morgan was a Fellow of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]], a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] and the President of the [[Royal Archaeological Institute]]. In 1832 he was elected a [[Royal Society|Fellow of the Royal Society]].

Morgan had inherited an ample fortune and in 1839 he had "The Friars" rebuilt for his use in the Elizabethan style. The Friars had at one time been home to [[Carmelites|Carmelite monks]]. He was said to have filled the house with "Tudor furniture, more curious than useful".&lt;ref name=friars&gt;[http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/page.cfm?orgid=721&amp;pid=46578 History of the Friars], Gwent Clinical School, Wales NHS, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan had an octagonal preaching platform installed halfway up the main wooden staircase where he would conduct services every day. His congregation would consist of his maids, the housekeeper, bailiff and the boot boy. The lock he had installed on the door reflected his interest in mechanisms and [[automata]]. The substantial brass lock is still on the door of his house and it has seven subsidiary controls.&lt;ref name=friars/&gt;

Morgan sat as Member of Parliament for [[Monmouthshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Monmouthshire]] from 1841 to 1874 for the Conservatives. He also served as a [[Justice of the Peace]] and [[Deputy Lieutenant]] for Monmouthshire. He was President of the [[Cambrian Archaeological Association]] 1857&amp;ndash;8.
 
He had been elected to [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] but was not active until 1848 after which he was Vice-President more than once.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;J. A. Jenkins, "Morgan, Charles Octavius Swinnerton (1803–1888)", rev. Brynley F. Roberts, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19218, accessed 27 July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan published papers on [[astrolabe]]s and [[episcopal ring]]s and early [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion plate]].

In 1852 Morgan published a series of papers in the Archaeological Journal about the assay and hallmarking of gold and silver, the first information that had been made public on this ancient practice. These sparked public interest in studying and collecting old gold and silver because of the information about its date and origins that can be discovered from the hallmarks.&lt;ref&gt;Octavius Morgan, M.P., F.S.A. (1852) 'Assay Marks on Gold and Silver Plate'. ''Archaeological Journal'' Volume 9, pp. 125&amp;ndash;140, 231&amp;ndash;246, 313&amp;ndash;319.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872 he published a valuable guide to the monuments in the [[Priory Church of St Mary, Abergavenny|Priory Church of St Mary]] in [[Abergavenny]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

[[File:Ship Clock at British Museum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mechanical Galleon]] that Morgan gave to the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref name=high/&gt;]]
During his lifetime Morgan made a number of generous donations to the [[British Museum]] including a [[Nef (metalwork)|nef]], an extravagant table ornament automaton known as the [[Mechanical Galleon]] in 1866.&lt;ref name=high&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/o/octavius_morgan_1803-88.aspx Octavius Morgan (1803&amp;ndash;88)], British Museum, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan never married and died on 5 August 1888 aged 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{Rayment-hc|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in his family's vault at St Basil's Church at [[Bassaleg]] in Monmouthshire. He left his clock collection, astronomical instruments and [[episcopal ring]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/o/octavius_morgan_1803-88.aspx British Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; His astrolabes included the 14th-century astrolabe used to call the faithful to prayer in [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/a/astrolabic_quadrant.aspx Astrolabic quadrant, made by Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Mizzi], British Museum, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan's collections of papers including his translations of Welsh poetry are in the [[National Library of Wales]].

A book published at the time and attributed to his fellow M.P, [[Reginald Blewitt]], describes Morgan as flippant in his youth and overbearing, arrogant, short and effeminate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blewitt.|first=Reginald|title=Memories of Monmouthshire|url=http://lgbtec.org.uk/page/memoris-of-monmouthshire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today his house's extensive dairy and orangery are gone as his home is now (2010) an educational facility for the Welsh National Health Service, but it is said that the house is still adorned with [[Latin]] inscriptions hidden within wooden carvings and a grand imported German fireplace bearing his initials.&lt;ref name=friars/&gt;

'''Ostia Antica''' is a large archaeological site, close to the modern town of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]], that is the location of the [[harbour]] city of [[ancient Rome]], 15 miles (25 kilometres) southwest of Rome. "Ostia" (plur. of "ostium") is a derivation of "os", the Latin word for "mouth". At the mouth of the [[Tiber|River Tiber]], Ostia was Rome's seaport, but due to [[siltation|silting]] the site now lies {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=off}} from the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=Ostia-Introduction |url=http://www.ostia-antica.org/intro.htm |title=OSTIA Harbour City of Ancient Rome|year=2008 |accessdate=2008-10-24 |quote=The ancient Roman city of Ostia was in antiquity situated at the mouth of the river Tiber, some {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=in}} to the west of Rome. The shoreline moved seawards, due to silting, from the Middle Ages until the 19th century. Therefore Ostia is today still lying next to the Tiber, but at a distance of some three kilometres ({{convert|3|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) from the beach. Ostia is Latin for "mouth", the mouth of the Tiber. The river was used as harbour, but in the Imperial period two harbour basins were added to the north, near Leonardo da Vinci airport. The harbour district was called Portus, Latin for "harbour".}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is noted for the excellent preservation of its ancient buildings, magnificent [[fresco]]es and impressive [[mosaic]]s.

==History==

[[File:Voie-ostie.jpg|thumbnail|The old entrance of the city]]

===Origins===
Ostia may have been Rome's first ''[[colonia (Roman)|colonia]]''. According to the legend [[Ancus Marcius]], the semi-legendary fourth [[kings of Rome|king of Rome]], who was the first to destroy [[Ficana]], an ancient town that was only {{convert|17|km|abbr=on}} from Rome and had a small harbour on the [[Tiber]], and then proceeded with establishing the new colony {{convert|10|km|abbr=on|0}} further west and closer to the sea coast. An inscription seems to confirm the establishment of the old [[castra|castrum]] of Ostia in the 7th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;"Ancus Marcius, the fourth of the kings from Romulus after the founding of the city [Rome] founded this first colony" (''Anco Marcio regi quarto a Romulo qui [[ab urbe condita]] primum coloniam --- deduxit'').&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest [[archaeology|archaeological]] remains so far discovered date back to only the 4th century BC.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Ostia|title=Ostia - Italy|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most ancient buildings currently visible are from the 3rd century BC, notably the ''Castrum'' (military camp);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ostia-antica.org/intro.htm|title=Ostia - Introduction|author=|date=|website=www.ostia-antica.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a slightly later date is the ''Capitolium'' (temple of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] and [[Minerva]]). The ''[[opus quadratum]]'' of the walls of the original ''castrum'' at Ostia provide important evidence for the building techniques that were employed in Roman [[urbanisation]] during the period of the [[Roman Republic|Middle Republic]].&lt;ref name="OSMAPArchitecture"&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Michael|title=OSMAP Building Types|url=https://www.laits.utexas.edu/isac/web/OSMAP/OSMAP_Masonry2.html|website=www.laits.utexas.edu|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil wars===
Ostia was a scene of fighting during the period of [[Sulla's first civil war|the civil wars]] between [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Sulla]] during the 1st century BC. In 87 BC, Marius attacked the city in order to cut off the flow of trade to Rome. Forces led by [[Cinna|Lucius Cornelius Cinna]], [[Carbo|Gnaeus Papirius Carbo]] and [[Sertorius|Quintus Sertorius]] crossed the Tiber at three points before capturing the city and plundering it. After his victory here, Marius moved on to attack and capture [[Antium]], [[Ariccia|Aricia]] and [[Lanuvium]] to further destroy the foodstores of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Appian, The Civil Wars, 1.8, ed. Horace White, 1899&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacking by pirates===
In 68 BC, the town was sacked by [[pirate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/30/opinion/30harris.html?ei=5088&amp;en=c6ea4658129c3e93&amp;ex=1317268800&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all Robert Harris, "Pirates of the Mediterranean" ''New York Times'', 30 September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; During the sack,&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, On the Command of Cn. Pompeius, 33&lt;/ref&gt; the port was set on fire, the consular war fleet was destroyed, and two prominent senators were kidnapped. This attack caused such panic in Rome that [[Pompey Magnus|Pompey the Great]] arranged for the [[tribune]] [[Aulus Gabinius]] to rise in the Roman Forum and propose a law, the ''[[lex Gabinia]]'', to allow Pompey to raise an army and destroy the pirates. Within a year, the pirates had been defeated.&lt;ref name="CiceroCommandPompeius"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cicero|first1=Marcus Tullius|last2=Yonge|first2=C. D. (Transl.)|title=To the citizens on Gnaeus Pompeius's command|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/To_the_citizens_on_Gnaeus_Pompeius%27s_command#12|website=Wikisource|accessdate=1 September 2017|quote=For why should I complain of the disaster of Ostia, and of that stain and blot on the republic, when almost under your very eyes, that fleet which was under the command of a Roman consul was taken and destroyed by the pirates? O ye immortal gods! could the incredible and godlike virtue of one man in so short a time bring so much light to the republic, that you who had lately been used to see a fleet of the enemy before the mouth of the Tiber, should now hear that there is not one ship belonging to the pirates on this side of the Atlantic? 34And although you have seen with what rapidity these things were done, still that rapidity ought not to be passed over by me in speaking of them.—For who ever, even if he were only going for the purpose of transacting business or making profit, contrived in so short a time to visit so many places, and to perform such long journeys, with as great celerity as Cnaeus Pompeius has performed his voyage, bearing with him the terrors of war as our general? He, when the weather could hardly be called open for sailing, went to Sicily, explored the coasts of Africa; from thence he came with his fleet to Sardinia, and these three great granaries of the republic he fortified with powerful garrisons and fleets; 35when, leaving Sardinia, he came to Italy, having secured the two Spains and Cisalpine Gaul with garrisons and ships. Having sent vessels also to the coast of Illyricum, and to every part of Achaia and Greece, he also adorned the two seas of Italy with very large fleets, and very sufficient garrisons; and he himself going in person, added all Cilicia to the dominions of the Roman people, on the forty-ninth day after he set out from Brundusium. Will the pirates who were anywhere to be found, were either taken prisoners and put to death, or else had surrendered themselves voluntarily to the power and authority of this one man.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town was then re-built, and provided with protective walls by the statesman and orator [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ostia-Antica-Excavations-Angelo-Pellegrino/dp/8870470911], Ostia Antica, A guide to Excavations, Pellegrino, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial Ostia===
[[File:OstiaAntica-SchemaRegioni.jpg|250px|thumb|Map of Ostia Antica.]]
[[File:OstianInsulae.JPG|thumb|250px|right|''[[insulae]]'' of Ostia Antica.]]During [[Julius Caesar]]'s time as [[Roman dictator|Dictator]], one of his improvements to the city was his establishment of better supervision of the supply of grain to Rome. He proposed better access to grain by the use of a new harbour in Ostia along with a canal from [[Tarracina]].[[File:Ostia-Toilets.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Public ''[[latrina]]e''.]]
The town was further developed during the first century AD under the influence of [[Tiberius]], who ordered the building of the town's first [[Piazzale delle Corporazioni|Forum]].  The town was also soon enriched by the construction of a new harbour on the northern mouths of the Tiber (which reaches the sea with a larger mouth in Ostia, ''Fiumara Grande'', and a narrower one near to the current [[Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport|Fiumicino International Airport]]).  The new harbor, not surprisingly called ''[[Portus]]'', from the Latin for "harbour," was excavated from the ground at the orders of the [[Roman Emperors|emperor]] [[Claudius]]. This harbour became silted up and needed to be supplemented later by a harbour built by [[Trajan]] finished in the year 113 AD; it has a hexagonal form,&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaBritannicaOstia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ostia - Italy|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Ostia|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=1 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to reduce the erosive forces of the waves.{{cn|date=September 2017}} Moreover, it must be noted that at a relatively short distance, there was also the harbour of [[Civitavecchia]] (''Centum Cellae''). These elements took business away from Ostia itself and began its commercial decline.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaBritannicaOstia" /&gt; In 2008 British archaeologists discovered the remains of the widest canal ever built by the Romans, 90 feet, which they believe connected Portus with Ostia across the Isola Sacra, which would have made the transport of large quantities of goods far easier than by land transport. In 2014 remains on the north side of the river opposite the city were discovered and the built-up area of the city extended beyond the perimeter of the south wall (the area within it is 69 hectares or 173 acres).

Ostia itself was provided with all the services a town of the time could require; in particular, a famous [[lighthouse]]. The popularity of the [[Cult of Mithras]] is evident in the discovery of eighteen [[Mithraeum|mithraea]].&lt;ref name="MithraismOstia"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffith|first1=Alison|title=Topographical dictionary - Mithraism|url=http://www.ostia-antica.org/dict/topics/mithraea/intro.htm|website=www.ostia-antica.org|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have also discovered the public ''[[latrina]]e'', organised for collective use as a series of seats that allow us to imagine today that their function was also a social one. Ostia had a large theatre, many public baths (such as the Thermae Gavii Maximi, or [[Baths at Ostia]]), numerous taverns and inns and a firefighting service. Ostia also contained the [[Ostia Synagogue]], the earliest [[synagogue]] yet identified in Europe; it created a stir when it was unearthed in 1960-61.&lt;ref&gt;L. Michael White, "Synagogue and Society in Imperial Ostia: Archaeological and Epigraphic Evidence" ''The Harvard Theological Review'' '''90'''.1 (January 1997), pp 23-58; Anders Runesson, "The Oldest Original Synagogue Building in the Diaspora: A Response to L. Michael White" ''HTR'' '''92'''.4 (October 1999), pp 409-433; L. Michael White "Reading the Ostia Synagogue: A Reply to A. Runesson", ''HTR'' '''92'''.4 (October 1999), pp 435-464.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late-Roman and sub-Roman Ostia===
[[File:Basilica di Sant'Aurea.JPG|thumb|left|Santa Aurea church.]]
Ostia grew to 50,000 inhabitants in the 2nd century, reaching a peak of some 100,000 inhabitants in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelthruhistory.com/html/historic60.html|title=:: TRAVEL THRU HISTORY - History ::|first=Paul|last=Norton|date=|website=www.travelthruhistory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v3Pf4qand_8C&amp;pg=PA436|title=The Jewish Traveler: Hadassah Magazine's Guide to the World's Jewish Communities and Sights|first=Alan M.|last=Tigay|date=24 September 1994|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbtxTd95IjwC&amp;pg=PA467|title=Mediterranean Europe|first=Duncan|last=Garwood|date=24 September 2018|publisher=Lonely Planet|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ostia became an [[episcopal see]] as early as the 3rd century AD, the cathedral (''[[titulus (Roman Catholic)|titulus]]'') of [[Santa Aurea]] being located on the burial site of [[Monica of Hippo|St Monica]], mother of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]; she died in an inn in the town in 387. 

In time mercantile activities became focused on [[Portus]] instead. It used to be thought that the city entered a period of slow decline after Constantine I made Portus, Ostia ceasing to be an active port and instead becoming a popular country retreat for rich aristocrats from Rome itself.&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaBritannicaOstia" /&gt;. In spite of the fact that Portus shows substantial growth in the 4th century the view that Ostia went into marked decline has had to be revised due to recent excavations and re-evaluation of the evidence. For scholars of the High Empire Ostia was the seaside version of Rome, the city of apartment buildings but became in late period "Rome's seaside luxury resort." The knocking down of some apartment blocks replaced by houses of the rich "were thought to have signalled the disappearance of Ostia's once-vibrant group of non-elite residents and labourers"..."recent research has suggested we take a more nuanced view of residential patterns and social demography in the Late Antique city".&lt;ref&gt;''Ostia in Late Antiquity'', Douglas Boin, 2013, Cambridge University, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier views of decay relied on fleeting references in the ancient sources and excavators ignoring evidence from the period that the town continued to thrive despite pockets of decay into the 6th century, "..life in Ostia ended not with a Vesuvian bang but with a whimper" after a slow decline from the 6th to the 9th centuries: repairs on baths (26 remained in operation during the 4th century) and public buildings, church construction, street repaving, residential and business expansion beyond the perimeter of the south wall (the presence of a small harbour, the Porta Marina on the sea there) and a huge 4th century villa located east, and the continued operation of the river port on the western edge of the town, the navalia, a squarish basin built in from the river, a warehouse on the east side and behind it a large bath complex erroneously called the palazzo imperial).&lt;ref&gt;ibid. pp. 21, 24, 52-53, 56, 57-65, 165, 231-236&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was mentioned by [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]] when he passed there in the late 4th century.&lt;ref name="StAugustineOstia"&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Augustine at Ostia|url=http://celt.ucc.ie/published/E880000-004/text001.html|website=celt.ucc.ie|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Rutilius Namatianus]] reported the lack of maintenance of the city ports in 414 AD.&lt;ref name="RutiliusNamatianus"&gt;{{cite web|title=RUTILIUS NAMATIANUS|url=http://www.ostia-antica.org/~atexts/rutilius.htm|website=www.ostia-antica.org|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This view has been challenged by Boin, who states Namatianus' verse is a literary construct and not consistent with the archaeological record, ibid. pp. 22, 25, (the poet was lamenting the lost greatness of Rome after the sack of 410 and was hoping for the rise again of the great city).

With the end of the [[Roman Empire]], Ostia fell slowly into decay, and was finally abandoned in the 9th century due to the repeated invasions and sackings by [[Arab]] pirates, including the [[Battle of Ostia]], a naval battle in 849 between [[Christians]] and [[Saracens]]; the remaining inhabitants moved to [[Gregoriopolis]].&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaBritannicaOstia" /&gt;

===Sacking and excavation===
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Follis-Maxentius-s3776.jpg|thumb|250px|Ostia housed a late imperial mint; this coin of [[Maxentius]] was struck there.]]
A "local sacking" was carried out by [[baroque architecture|Baroque architects]],{{when|date=February 2018}} who used the remains as a sort of [[marble]] storehouse for the ''[[palazzo|palazzi]]'' they were building in Rome. 

Soon after, foreign explorers came in search of ancient statues and objects.{{who|date=February 2018}}

The [[Papacy]] started organising its own investigations with [[Pope Pius VII]]; under [[Benito Mussolini]] massive excavations were undertaken from 1939 to 1942&lt;ref name="britannica.com"/&gt; during which several remains, particularly from the republican period, were brought to light. The first volume of the official series ''Scavi di Ostia'' appeared in 1954; it was devoted to a topography of the town by [[Italo Gismondi]] and after a hiatus the research still continues today. Though untouched areas adjacent to the original excavations were left undisturbed awaiting a more precise dating of Roman pottery types, the "Baths of the Swimmer", named for the mosaic figure in the ''apodyterium'', were meticulously excavated, in 1966–70 and 1974–75, in part as a training ground for young archaeologists and in part to establish a laboratory of well-understood finds as a teaching aid. It has been estimated that two-thirds of the ancient town are as yet unexcavated. In 2014, a [[geophysical]] survey using [[magnetometry]], among other techniques, revealed the existence of a boundary wall on the north side of the Tiber enclosing an unexcavated area of the city containing three massive warehouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Emily|title=Archaeologists Unearth New Areas Of Ancient Roman City|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/17/roman-port-city-ostia-archaeology-_n_5167948.html|accessdate=4 May 2014|newspaper=huffingtonpost.com|date=17–19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Earl|first=Graeme|title=New city wall discovered at Ostia|url=http://www.portusproject.org/blog/2014/04/new-city-wall-discovered-ostia/|publisher=University of Southampton|accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qalaat Tannour''' (also known as '''Qalaat et Tannoûr''') is a [[Shepherd Neolithic]] archaeological site located halfway between [[Britel]] and [[Haour Taala]], {{convert|12|km|mi}} southwest of [[Baalbek]] in the [[Baalbek District]] of the [[Beqaa Governorate]] in [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L.

The surface site was discovered by  M. Besançon in 1966 on a hill of exposed limestone rocks. It was the furthest south of all of the Shepherd Neolithic sites catalogued at the time. [[Flint]] tools found at the location were generally in a brown or grey, some showing a white [[patina]]. Blade types were typically short but also included thin and backed varieties, steep-scrapers and cores. The material was stored with the [[Saint Joseph University]], [[Museum of Lebanese Prehistory]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"/&gt;

Several [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[tomb]]s were also noted at the site.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"/&gt;

[[File:Greenish Ring Cairn - geograph.org.uk - 898257.jpg|thumb|Greenish Ring Cairn]]
A '''ring cairn''' (also correctly termed a '''ring bank enclosure''', but sometimes wrongly described as a [[ring barrow]]) is a circular or slightly oval, ring-shaped, low (maximum 0.5&amp;nbsp;metres high) embankment, several metres wide and from 8 to 20 metres in diameter. It is made of stone and earth and was originally empty in the centre. In several cases the middle of the ring was later used (at [[Hound Tor]], for example, there is a [[stone cist]] in the centre). The low profile of these cairns is not always possible to make out without conducting excavations.

== Distribution ==
These sites date to the [[Bronze Age]] and occur in [[Cornwall]]; [[Wales]] and [[Derbyshire]] ([[Ring sites of Barbrook|Barbrook&amp;nbsp;IV and V]] and Green Low) in [[England]] and in [[Ireland]].

== Description ==
[[File:Ring Cairn near Mains of Moyness - geograph.org.uk - 257472.jpg|thumb|lefts|Ring cairn near Mains of Moyness]]
The [[cairn]]s look like flat variants of the significantly higher [[Clava cairn]]s, which are often called ring cairns by laymen. The situation is rather different on the gritstones of the Eastern Uplands. Here it is more common to find smaller stone circles and ring cairns. The patterned relationship of these smaller monuments to cairnfield systems throughout the Eastern Moors suggests that they were built and used by specific communities, probably in the centuries around 2000 BC. Although details vary from one site to another, nearly all comprise a ring of small upright stones set on the inner edge of a roughly circular bank.

== Function ==

Ring cairns may have had a function that lay somewhere between that of the much older [[henge]]s and the contemporary [[stone circle]]s. The fact that in southeast Wales there are so few stone circles could be related to the fact that ring cairns were built there instead.

Although graves have been found in some ring cairns, this does not appear to be their original purpose. In the central area, graves and pits with cremation ashes, fireplaces and sometimes, small, low cairns are found.

The slightly oval ring cairns near [[Arthur's Stone, Gower|Arthur's Stone]] on the [[Gower Peninsula]] show that the inner edges of ring cairns were especially carefully constructed and were set in front of a small grave. Originally there was a passage through the ring here, about ten metres across, that was blocked when the cairn ceased to be used.

[[File:Emigrants crossing the Plains 1859.png|thumb|upright=1.75|right|alt=A drawing of European American homesteaders and their wagons|European American emigrants on their way to California, {{circa|1859}}]]

The '''Rose–Baley Party''' was the first [[European American]] emigrant [[wagon train]] to traverse the [[35th parallel north|35th parallel]] route known as [[Beale's Wagon Road]], established by [[Edward Fitzgerald Beale]], from [[Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico]] to the [[Colorado River]] near present-day [[Needles, California]].

In 1858, a wealthy businessman from [[Keosauqua, Iowa]], [[Leonard John Rose]], formed the party after hearing stories from gold miners returning from California. He subsequently financed a well-equipped wagon train that included twenty horses and two hundred head of [[purebred]] red [[Shorthorn|Durham]] cattle. He also acquired four large [[covered wagon]]s and three [[yoke]] of oxen to pull them each wagon. The Rose company left Iowa in early April, and in mid-May they were joined by the Baley company, led by a forty-four-year-old veteran of the [[Black Hawk War]], [[Gillum Baley]]. Their combined outfits numbered twenty wagons, forty men, fifty to sixty women and children, and nearly five hundred head of cattle. [[John Udell]], a 62-year-old Baptist minister kept a daily journal of the party's travels, recording the locations of their campsites, documenting their progress, and noting the availability of resources.

On August 30, 1858, after having traveled more than {{convert|1200|mi}} in four months, the Rose–Baley Party were attacked by three hundred [[Mohave people|Mohave]] warriors as they prepared to cross the Colorado River. Eight members of the party were killed, including five children, and thirteen wounded. The emigrants held off the assault, killing seventeen Mohave, but decided to backtrack more than {{convert|500|mi}} to [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], instead of continuing on to their intended destination in southern California.

==Sourcing==
According to Charles W. Baley, great-grand nephew of Baley company leader, Gillum Baley, and the author of ''Disaster at the Colorado: Beale's Wagon Road and the First Emigrant Party'' (2002), little has been written about [[Beale's Wagon Road]] because the negative experiences of the first wagon trains to attempt the passage effectively "discouraged its use".{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=vii}} Baley's great-grandparents joined his great-great uncle in forming the company in 1858, which merged with one led by [[Leonard John Rose]] to make the Rose–Baley Party.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=vii}}

Baley's account drew heavily from the only known journal kept by a member of the group. [[John Udell]], a 62-year-old Baptist minister who had left his home in Missouri with his wife, Emily, kept a daily record of the party's travels, recording the locations of their campsites and their estimated distance from Missouri, the weather and road conditions, and the availability of grass, water, and wood.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=viii, 5–7, 15–16}} Baley described Udell's journal as the "basic framework" of his research.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=viii}} The only other source of firsthand information is Rose, whose account was printed in the ''Missouri Republican'' in 1859, and later reprinted as an appendix in Dr. Robert Glass Cleland's work, ''The Cattle on a Thousand Hills: Southern California, 1850-1880''.{{sfn|Belden|1951|p=43}}

==E.F. Beale expedition==
[[File:EFBeale.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A black and white photograph of a mustachioed man|E.F. Beale]]

In October 1857, an expedition led by [[Edward Fitzgerald Beale]] was tasked with establishing a trade route along the [[35th parallel north|35th parallel]] from [[Fort Smith, Arkansas|Fort Smith]], Arkansas to [[Los Angeles]], California.{{sfn|Thrapp|1991|p=76}}{{refn|group=nb|Beale's Wagon Road would eventually be supplanted first by the railroad, then [[U.S. Route 66]], and later, [[Interstate 40]].{{sfn|Lutzick|2013|p=8}}}} The wagon road began at Fort Smith and continued through [[Fort Defiance, Arizona]] before crossing the [[Colorado River]] near present-day [[Needles, California]].{{sfn|Ricky|1999|p=100}}{{refn|group=nb|The [[Mojave Road]] stretches from where Beale's Wagon Road meets the Colorado River to southern California.{{sfn|Hinckley|2012|p=32}}}} The location where Beale crossed the river, en route to California, became known as Beale's Crossing.{{sfn|Utley|1981|p=164}} Beale described the route, "It is the shortest from our western frontier by {{convert|300|mi}}, being nearly directly west. It is the most level: our wagons only double-teaming once in the entire distance, and that at a short hill, and over a surface heretofore unbroken by wheels or trail on any kind. It is well-watered: our greatest distance without water at any time being {{convert|20|mi}}. It is well-timbered, and in many places the growth is far beyond that of any part of the world I have ever seen. It is temperate in climate, passing for the most part over an elevated region. It is salubrious: not one of our party requiring the slightest medical attendance from the time of our leaving to our arrival&amp;nbsp;... It crosses the great desert (which must be crossed by any road to California) at its narrowest point."{{sfn|Bonsal|1912|p=213}}

==Formation==
During the summer of 1858, a large emigrant [[wagon train]] became the first to traverse Beale's 35th parallel route to [[Mohave people|Mohave]] country.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=24, 28–37, 39–40}} A wealthy businessman from [[Keosauqua, Iowa]], Leonard John Rose, known as L.J. Rose, formed a company with his family of seven, his foreman, Alpha Brown, and his family, and seventeen grubstakers, workers who were not paid a salary, but given food and board in exchange for their labor. Rose was born in [[Rottenburg am Neckar|Rottenburg]], Germany in 1827; at the age of eight, he immigrated to the United States.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=2–3}} In 1892, writing in ''The Californian'', he identified what motivated him to leave Iowa, where he had built several successful businesses:
{{Quote|In 1858 some miners who had just returned from California so fired my imagination with descriptions of its glorious climate, wealth of flowers, and luscious fruits, that I was inspired with an irresistible desire to experience in person the delights to be found in the land of plenty.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=3}}}}
[[File:The How and Why Library 009.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A pencil drawing of a large prairie schooner being drawn by two oxen, with attendant cowboys|A "prairie schooner" covered wagon, 1909]]

To finance the venture, Rose sold the majority of his assets, and after paying off his debts was left with $30,000, then a considerable amount of money. These funds enabled him to finance an especially well-equipped wagon train that included twenty horses, including two [[Morgan horse|Morgan]] [[Filly|fillies]] and a Morgan [[stallion]] named Black Morrill; their combined value exceeded $3,000. He also purchased two hundred head of red Durham cattle, which he planned to resell in California for profit.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=2–3}} To complete the train, Rose acquired four large ox-drawn [[Covered wagon|prairie schooner]] style [[covered wagon]]s, each required three [[yoke]]s (i.e. six oxen) to pull each wagon.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=4}}  Three wagons were loaded with supplies, and the fourth was used by Alpha Brown and his family. Rose's family traveled in a small wagon that had once been used as an ambulance, which was pulled by a pair of mules.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=4}} {{sfn|Cheney|1915|pp=83–4}}

According to Baley, political and economic factors prompted two Hedgpeth and two Baley families to leave northwestern Missouri for California in early 1858. One factor was the enactment of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]], which admitted Nebraska into the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] as a free territory and granted Kansas the right to decide on the legality of slavery within the state.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=8–11}} The resulting tensions between [[Proslavery|pro-slavery]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery]] groups fueled conflict near the Missouri state line, affecting its western counties, including Nodaway, where the Baleys and Hedgpeths lived. In Baley's opinion, the financial [[Panic of 1857]] further contributed to instability in the region, driving many mid-westerners to seek a better life in California.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=11}} The combined Baley-Hedgpeth outfits were led by a forty-four-year-old veteran of the [[Black Hawk War]], Gillum Baley, and comprised eight Murphy wagons, sixty-two oxen, seventy-five head of cattle, and several riding horses. They employed half-a-dozen grubstakers to tend their stock.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=11–12}}{{refn|group=nb|Both the Baley and Hedgpeth companies also brought small libraries with them.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=11}}}}

==Journey==
[[File:HerdQuit.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|left|A classic image of the American [[cowboy]], as portrayed by [[Charles Marion Russell|C.M. Russell]]]]

The Rose company left Iowa in April; they traveled to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], then named Westport, which they reached via [[steamboat]] across the [[Missouri River]].{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=5}} In mid-May, they were joined by the Baley company while resting at Cottonwood Creek, near present-day [[Durham, Kansas]].{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=5, 15}} In the interests of safety, the groups agreed to an informal merger; their combined outfits numbered twenty wagons, forty men, fifty to sixty women and children, and nearly five hundred head of [[Livestock branding|unbranded]] cattle.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=15}}

Baley notes that whereas most emigrants who traveled from the [[Midwestern United States]] to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] took the [[Oregon Trail]], in 1858 concerns about the [[Utah War|Mormon War]] led many, including the Rose–Baley Party, to avoid Utah by taking the [[Santa Fe Trail]] to New Mexico, where a viable southern route could then be taken to California.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=1–3, 14–15}}{{refn|group=nb|According to J.W. Cheney, their decision to avoid Utah by taking a southern route added five hundred miles to the trip. Cheney wrote a story about the party in 1915, his material drew heavily from an account given to him by Edward Akey, a member of the Rose company.{{sfn|Cheney|1915|pp=84, 97}}}} The Santa Fe Trail followed the [[Arkansas River]] until it split into two paths near [[Cimarron, Kansas]]. The Mountain Branch continued into the mountains of southern Colorado, and the Cimarron Cutoff avoided mountains, but traversed the fifty-mile-wide Cimarron Desert before the paths met near [[Las Vegas, New Mexico]]. The Cimarron Cutoff was {{convert|100|mi}} shorter and easier to navigate with large wagons, but according to Baley it also led its travelers through the territory of the hostile [[Comanche]] and [[Kiowa]] people. Nonetheless, the Rose–Baley Party chose this path.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=13–14}}{{refn|group=nb|In 1831, famed mountain man [[Jedediah Smith]] was killed by Comanches while taking the Cimarron Cutoff.{{sfn|Groom|2011|p=66}}}}

The wagon train reached [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] on June 23 and prepared for the journey to the Colorado River by way of [[Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico]], where, despite Udell's lone dissent, they would become the first emigrant train to venture onto Beale's Wagon Road.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=24, 28–37, 39–40}} Udell, writing in his journal, explained his concern: "I thought it was preposterous to start on so long a journey with so many woman and helpless children, and so many dangers attending the attempt."{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=18}} According to Baley, the emigrants first learned of the recently surveyed road while visiting Albuquerque. Townspeople and army officers, including [[Benjamin Bonneville]], encouraged them to take the new route, which was shorter than the established southern trails by {{convert|200|mi}}, or approximately thirty days travel. They were also told that there was a reliable supply of food and water along the way, and the area was free of hostile Native Americans.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=31, 34}} E.F. Beale was in [[Washington, D.C.]] at the time, making recommendations to members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]:

{{Quote|I regard the establishment of a military post on the Colorado River as an indispensable necessity for the emigrant over this road; for although the Indians living in the rich meadow lands are agricultural, and consequently peaceable, they are very numerous, so much so that we counted 800 men around our camp on the second day after our arrival on the banks of the river. The temptation of scattered emigrant parties with their families, and the confusion of inexperienced teamsters, rafting so wide and rapid a river with their wagons and families, would offer too strong a temptation for the Indians to withstand.{{sfn|Beale|1858|p=3}}}}

Beale suggested that, in addition to a military fort, the route was also in immediate need of bridges and dams to ensure safe travel and provide a reliable water supply; he requested $100,000 to fund the improvements.{{sfn|Beale|1858|pp=1–3}} Further complicating the journey, the only pockets of civilization between Albuquerque and [[San Bernardino, California]], a distance of {{convert|600|mi}}, were the Zuni and [[Laguna Pueblo|Laguna]] pueblos.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=29–30}} According to Baley, US Army officers stationed in Albuquerque insisted the emigrants hire Jose Manuel Savedra, a Mexican guide who had traveled with Beale during his initial survey of the route, and his interpreter, Petro.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=30–4}} Unbeknownst to the group, Beale was unhappy with Savedra's scouting abilities, and had demoted him to helping with the animals in the pack train. The Rose–Baley Party paid Savedra's fee of $500 in advance.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=31–3}}

[[File:Timothy O'Sullivan, South side of Inscription Rock, New Mexico, 1873.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A black and white image of a tall rock wall|El Morro in 1873]]

Udell recorded that the Rose–Baley Party left Albuquerque on June 26 and began crossing the [[Rio Grande]] on a [[ferry]]. Three days later, as the last of their outfit crossed, one of Rose's men, Frank Emerdick, drowned in the river.{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=20}} Baley notes that they traveled for the next five days and, because there were no suitable campsites nearby, did not stop to celebrate [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], as would most westbound emigrants. On July 5, they reached the [[Zuni Mountains]], a branch of the [[Rocky Mountains]]; two days later they traversed the [[Continental Divide of the Americas]], which, although {{convert|8000|ft}} to {{convert|9000|ft}} feet in elevation, was a relatively easy passage.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=35–6}} Udell described the road as "smooth and fine, we traveled it in a day with our ox teams, and no hard labor."{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=23}} On July 7, they camped near [[El Morro National Monument]], then called Inscription Rock, and several members of the party, including Rose and Udell, carved their names into stone&amp;nbsp;– a tradition dating back to 1605.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=37}}{{refn|group=nb|The oldest inscription at El Morro National Monument is that of New Mexico's first Spanish governor, [[Juan de Oñate]], who marked the rock on April 16, 1605.{{sfn|Welsh|Welsh|2000|p=3}}}} Their inscriptions indicated that they were aware of being the first emigrants in the region.{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=24}}

[[File:ZuniPueblo1850.jpg|right|thumb|alt= A pencil drawing of a large Adobe structure|An illustration of Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico, 1850]]

On July 10, the Rose–Baley Party reached Zuni Pueblo, which according to Baley was then home to as many as two thousand agricultural Native Americans. They spent several hours visiting and sightseeing, and the Zuni sold them cornmeal and vegetables, as this was the last such opportunity to purchase supplies until San Bernardino, approximately {{convert|500|mi}} away. According to Baley, this is most likely the first time the Zuni had encountered European women and children, and the first time the emigrants had ever seen people with [[albinism]], which, although rare, was noticeably present in the Zuni population. They left Zuni Pueblo late that afternoon and entered unfamiliar territory that, until now, had only been traversed by Native Americans, explorers, [[Mountain man|mountain men]], and Spanish missionaries. In Baley's opinion, the Rose–Baley Party had previously enjoyed the benefits of a primitive but well-established trail; however, at this point they became the first emigrant wagon train to venture onto the untested Beale's Wagon Road.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=38–40}}

==Beale's Wagon Road==
{{further|Beale's Wagon Road}}
[[File:San Francisco Peaks.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A color image of a mountain|The San Francisco Peaks viewed from atop nearby [[Mount Elden]], elevation 9,301 feet]]

In Baley's opinion, Udell was right to be concerned about the road, and adds: "although Beale had taken a few wagons over the route, [in 1858 it] was little more than a survey trail marked only by faint wagon tracks, an occasional stone cairn, and perhaps a few axe blazes on trees."{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=29}} Portions of the road followed human and animal trails, and&amp;nbsp;– although potable water was sporadically available&amp;nbsp;– there were also long stretches called ''jornadas'', where it was scarce. From the [[San Francisco Peaks]] to the Colorado River, vital resources were in short supply.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=29–30}}

Because Beale's Wagon Road crossed territory that consisted mainly of the [[Colorado Plateau]]'s rocky high desert, the next water available to the Rose–Baley Party was at a spot named Jacob's Well, located {{convert|36|mi}} west of Zuni Pueblo and {{convert|32|mi}} west of their July 10 campsite. Accordingly, Baley notes that the emigrants were careful to not get lost between watering holes.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=40–1}} Udell recorded that, after traveling for more than half a day, they rested and watered their stock at the well, which produced [[Brackish water|brackish]] but acceptable water. Later that evening, they trekked another {{convert|8|mi}} to [[Navajo Springs, Arizona|Navajo Springs]], where they camped for the night and rested the next day.{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=25–6}}{{refn|group=nb|According to Baley, the party was now entering the domain of the [[Navajo people]], who strongly disliked outsiders in their land. Nevertheless, the emigrants did not see any Navajo in the area, as they passed the warmer months of the year in higher country where they could find plentiful grass for their flocks of sheep.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=41}}}}

[[File:Blue Mesa Painted Desert.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A color image of some desert badlands|Painted desert and petrified logs seen from Blue Mesa, Petrified Forest National Park]]

According to Udell's journal, after Navajo Springs the next available water was {{convert|40|mi}} distant, at the [[Little Colorado River]].{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=26–7}} In between was an area that is now home to [[Petrified Forest National Park]], and several members of the party gathered souvenirs of [[petrified wood]] there.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=41}} They reached the Little Colorado at a spot near present-day [[Holbrook, Arizona]], on July 16, and although the river was brackish and underscored with [[quicksand]], the emigrants were able to secure drinkable water by digging holes in the riverbank that allowed sediment to settle until the water was clear enough for consumption.{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=27}} Next, they followed the river {{convert|85|mi}} to a location that Baley identified as [[Canyon Diablo (canyon)|Canyon Diablo]].{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=41}}

On July 18, Udell recorded that spirits were high amongst the Rose–Baley Party: "Our large company continue to be harmonious, friendly, and kind to each other&amp;nbsp;... General good health prevails&amp;nbsp;... Travel today, {{convert|10|mi}}, and 1,112 from the Missouri River."{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=28}} The Rose–Baley Party diverged from the Little Colorado River where it meets Canyon Diablo, near present-day [[Winslow, Arizona]]. Uncertain where the next source of clean water was, they decided to camp near the canyon, where they successfully hunted for game while searching for a fresh spring.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=42}}{{refn|group=nb|While camped near Canyon Diablo, several members of the Rose-Baley Party, including Gillum Baley and Amanda Rose, carved their names into Register Rock No. 4.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=43}}}} By the late afternoon of July 24, Savedra returned to camp and reported that they had found water {{convert|17|mi}} away at Walnut Creek, now part of [[Walnut Canyon National Monument]]. They immediately packed up their camp and left, as they were becoming accustomed to evening and night travel, which allowed them to refrain from exertion during the peak heat of the day. They covered {{convert|20|mi}} on July 25 before stopping near a spring in the pine-covered foothills of Arizona's tallest mountains, the San Francisco Peaks, which can be seen for {{convert|100|mi}} in most directions. The range's cool forests gave them a much-needed respite from the intense heat and aridity of the high plains desert.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=43–4}}

[[File:San Francisco Peaks, winter.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A color image of a snow-covered mountain|Humphreys Peak in winter]]

Baley notes that the Rose–Baley Party so enjoyed their camp, near present-day [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], they decided to devote a few extra days to recuperation and sightseeing, and several members of the wagon train climbed [[Humphreys Peak]], which at 12,633 feet is the highest point in Arizona. While climbing the mountain, they came across a large snowfield and were surprised to see snow and ice in late July. Before their descent, they entertained themselves by pushing a massive boulder down the mountainside. Up to this point, the emigrants had enjoyed a primitive but decent road, good small game hunting, and a consistent supply of water, grass, and wood. They had experienced what Baley described as "beautiful and interesting" scenery and encountered only friendly Native Americans; however, a drastic change in these conditions was imminent.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=44}}

According to Baley, on July 29 Savedra informed the Rose–Baley Party, now camped near Leroux Springs, that the next reliable drinking water was seventy or {{convert|80|mi}} away, and there would not be a closer source until the coming rainy season.{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=32–3}} This distance exceeded what most animals could travel without water, and several members of the party were opposed to proceeding any further west until another source had been found.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=45}} Udell disagreed, "I contended that we had better travel on, for, with careful and proper treatment, we could get the stock through to water, and if we remain here until the rainy season, in all human probability our provisions would be exhausted, and we should parish with starvation."{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=33}} Despite his pleas, nobody wanted to go on until they had located potable water, so six men agreed to undertake a search in hopes that Savedra had overlooked a closer source. Two days later, a man returned to camp and reported that a spring had been found {{convert|15|mi}} west, but its supply was so sparse that it could not meet the needs of the entire wagon train at once. After a thorough debate it was decided that, despite stern warnings from Army officers in Albuquerque against splitting into smaller groups, the best course of action was to divide the train in two and water their stock separately.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=46}}

Udell recorded that on August 1, the Rose company ventured west without the Baley company, who waited one full day before starting out from Leroux Springs. In the meantime, the search party had located enough springs to sustain them for the next {{convert|50|mi}}. Several days later, the party reached their last known source of water, and Savedra informed them that there was not another for {{convert|60|mi}}.{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=33–4, 35}} Because that was too long for their animals to travel without water, the party decided to backtrack approximately {{convert|26|mi}} to the location of the last reliable supply at Cataract Creek.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=47}} Udell again protested to no avail, recording in his journal that night: "Had there been a road that I could have traveled without a guide, I should have gone on and risked the consequences."{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=35–6}} Having trekked {{convert|52|mi}} without clean water, the party's stock had grown extremely thirsty. The supply at Cataract Canyon was limited, and it contained what Udell called "wigglers"; however, they had no choice but to drink from, and allow their animals to drink from, the less than ideal source. By August 9, the Rose–Baley Party had begun to lose confidence in Savedra's ability to find water, and had been forced to do their own scouting for the precious resource. They had taken to building [[Barrel|casks]] out of pine in hopes that they could gather enough in containers to last them until the next acceptable supply. Udell wrote, "Our water still holds out&amp;nbsp;... like the widow's cruse of oil, and tastes more pleasant, having been stirred up so often for us."{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=36–7}}

On August 13, Udell noted that the area received a substantial rainfall that marginally eased the Rose–Baley Party's concerns regarding the scarcity of water in the region. Later that evening, the men who had been searching for it during the last five days returned to camp and reported that they had found an acceptable source {{convert|40|mi}} distant and another {{convert|80|mi}} away.{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=37–8}} The emigrants spent the next morning filling casks and preparing for travel; they left late that afternoon, and after having trekked continuously for nearly twenty-four hours arrived at Partridge Creek the next day. That night a thunderstorm filled the creek with rainwater, further easing their concerns; however, after traveling {{convert|20|mi}} the following day, they realized that the recent rainfalls has not reached that far, forcing them to make a dry camp on August 17.{{sfn|Udell|1946|pp=38–9}}

[[File:Two young Walapai Indian mothers with their children on their backs, Hackbury, Arizona, ca.1900 (CHS-3176).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|alt=A black and white photograph of two Native American women with children in backpacks|Two Hualapai mothers with children on their backs, Hackbury, Arizona, c. 1900]]

On August 18, after having traveled the last {{convert|85|mi}} without reliable grass or water, the Rose–Baley Party located a field and a spring that were sufficient to satisfy their stock. That night, despite posting round-the-clock guards, a mare and a mule went missing, and three searchers were sent to find them. They tracked the animals to a deep canyon, where Native Americans hiding in the rocks shot arrows at them. Savedra noticed the Natives watching the party from the nearby foothills the following day, and was able to draw them into camp using sign language. In Baley's opinion, the Natives were most likely [[Hualapai]]. They could speak a few words of Spanish and English, and Savedra was able to communicate with them using their dialect and sign language. They admitted to having the group's missing animals, but insisted that the Mohave had stolen them. They repeatedly thumped their chest while uttering, "Hanna, Hanna", meaning "good" Native, insisting that the Mohave were "bad" Natives.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=50–1}}

According to Rose, Savedra knew that the Mohave rarely ventured this far from their homelands, so they assumed the Hualapai had taken the animals, which were returned the following morning as the party camped at [[Peach Springs, Arizona|Peach Springs]].{{sfn|Rose|1941|pp=307–8}} The animals were led back by twenty-five Natives hoping for compensation in return, as Udell explained: "It was soon evident that they expected very extravagant rewards, all expecting shoes, clothing, and trinkets, besides some cattle&amp;nbsp;... many remained in camp with us that night, doubtless for the purpose of stealing, but the guard kept so sharp a lookout that they found no opportunity."{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=50–1}} On August 20, the party awoke to another fifty Hualapai anticipating gifts in exchange for the return of the stolen animals. The Natives left around noon, after receiving tobacco, trinkets, and food, but the emigrants noticed that six oxen were missing. A search team located four carcasses that had been stripped of their flesh; the other two animals were found nearby, having been recently killed, but not yet butchered. That night, the Rose–Baley Party decided to once again split their wagon train in response to the scarcity of water. According to Baley, as they journeyed from their campsite at Peach Springs to the Colorado River more than {{convert|100|mi}} away, they were almost continuously harassed by Natives, who sent arrows flying into their wagon train during the day and raided their camp at night.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=51–3}}

==Colorado River==
Udell recorded that in the late afternoon of August 27, 1858, the Rose–Baley Party reached the [[Black Mountains (Arizona)|Black Mountains]]. They made their crossing at Sitgreaves Pass, elevation 3,652 feet and named after Lieutenant Lorenzo Sitgreaves, who led an expedition party to the region in 1851. From the crest they could see the Colorado River in the distance.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=56}} Having traveled all night and worked continuously during the morning and afternoon, the Rose–Baley Party stopped to prepare their first meal of the day. Soon afterward, a small group of Mohave warriors approached and asked, in a combination of broken English and Spanish, how many people their wagon train included and whether they intended to permanently settle near the Colorado River. The Mohave, who appeared friendly and had brought with them corn and melons, which they sold to the emigrants, were promised that the wagon train planned to travel through the region en route to their intended destination in Southern California. This seemed to appease the Natives, many of whom helped the party during their descent down the western slope of the Black Mountains to the Colorado River below.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=59}} The emigrants were now entering Mohave country, near present-day [[Needles, California]].{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=56, 58}}

[[File:Mohave Indians.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A black and white photograph of two Mohave men next to the Colorado River, 1871|Two Mohave men next to the Colorado River, 1871]]

By midnight, the Baley company had fallen behind the Rose company and decided to stop and make a mountain camp while Rose and others continued to the Colorado River, where they planned to water their combined stock and build a raft in preparation for the impending river crossing. By noon on August 28, Rose had reached a patch of Cottonwood trees about one mile from the river, where their oxen were unhitched and allowed to join the loose stock racing towards the water. There the emigrants encountered more Mohave, but unlike the friendly ones that greeted them at Sitgreaves Pass, these were rude and hostile. After a thorough watering, the work oxen were returned to the wagons.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=61}} Rose and his wife, Amanda, decided to scout the river bank for a suitable campsite, exiting their wagon to make the journey by foot. Moments later, an aggressive Mohave placed his hand on her shoulder and bosom, and she ran back, terrified, to the relative safety of their wagon. Rose, not wanting to incite the Mohave, ignored the incident and continued to the river. Other Mohave harassed Alpha Brown's family, briefly threatening to take his wife's dress and abduct their son. That danger was averted, but many Mohave set about driving off and slaughtering several of the party's cattle before leaving the emigrants alone at their encampment, some two hundred yards from the river and {{convert|10|mi}} away from the Baley company's mountain camp.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=61–2}}

The following morning, they moved their camp to the river bank to facilitate easier watering of their stock. They were visited around noon by twenty-five warriors and a Mohave sub-chief, who heard their complaints about the killing of their livestock and assured them that no further depredations would occur, and that they could cross the Colorado as they pleased. About one hour later, another chief and several warriors approached the camp; after receiving gifts, they also left without incident.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=63–4}} According to Rose, upon hearing of the emigrants plans the chief gave them, "a very searching look, as if not half believing it".{{sfn|Rose|1859|p=312}} By noon, the party had moved their camp still closer to where they planned to cross, about a mile downriver near a patch of cottonwood trees that were suitable for building rafts.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=63–4}}

==Mohave attack==
According to Baley, at approximately 2 p.m. on August 30, 1858, the emigrants camped near the Colorado River heard Alpha Brown's step-daughter, [[Sallie Fox]], screaming. She had been playing in a wagon when she noticed several Mohave nearby. Having lost the element of surprise, three hundred warriors then let out [[Battle cry|war whoops]] as they shot arrows into the camp, mortally wounding Rose's foreman, Alpha Brown.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=67–9}} Udell described the attack as "like a shower" of arrows.{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=45}} According to Rose, "I have no doubt they expected to massacre us. But we were well armed and the men that were in camp ready to receive them."{{sfn|Rose|1941|p=312}} As the men mounted a defense, the women ran with their children to the covered wagons.{{sfn|Woodward|1953|p=69}} Both Udell and Rose stated that the fighting lasted for approximately two hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rose|1941|p=312}}; {{harvnb|Udell|1946|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baley explains that when a Mohave chief who appeared to be leading the attack stepped out in front of his warriors and taunted the emigrants, Gillum Baley, a veteran of the Black Hawk War and a noted marksman, took him down with a single rifle shot. The Mohave warriors then retrieved the chief's body and retreated from the battle.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=70–1}}

According to Udell, eight members of the Rose-Baley party had been killed and thirteen wounded.{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=46}} Rose stated that of the train's livestock, only ten horses and seventeen cattle remained.{{sfn|Rose|1941|p=313}} Baley notes that in addition to the killing of Alpha Brown, the entirety of the seven-member Bentner family, including five children, were massacred while traveling unaccompanied from Baley's mountain camp to Rose's river camp.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=5, 71}}{{refn|group=nb|According to Baley, when the Bentner family wagon was located, the eldest daughter's naked body was found nearby; her face had been mutilated. The other Bentners were never found; however, Mohave warriors had taunted the emigrants near the river with a long pole with several [[Scalping|scalps]] attached, which the Rose-Baley Party assumed had come from the Bentners.{{sfn|Baley|2002|p=67}}}} However subsequent investigations showed that the Bentner's were attacked by a group of Hualapais including 7 renegade Mohave warriors.{{sfn|Sherer|1994|page=82-84}} The emigrants killed approximately seventeen Mohave warriors.{{sfn|Zappia|2014|p=129}} In the opinion of the cultural anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]], "the event sealed the fate of the Mohave as an independent people."{{sfn|Kroeber|Kroeber|1973|p=53}} In 1859, the US military established [[Fort Mohave]] near the location of the battle at Beale's Crossing.{{sfn|Shepherd|2010|p=31}}

==Aftermath==
When the battle had ended, and the Mohave retreated, the Rose company gathered to discuss their options. Being low on ammunition and manpower, the emigrants were not confident in their ability to hold off another attack. So, although San Bernardino, at about {{convert|170|mi}} away was much closer, they unanimously decided to backtrack the nearly {{convert|500|mi}} to Albuquerque. Because they were dangerously low on supplies, their successful return to Albuquerque was partly contingent upon finding assistance from west-bound emigrants. Before beginning the return trip, they wrapped Alpha Brown's body in chains and committed it to the Colorado River. With only one remaining wagon and the ambulance, they decided which items they could carry and which they should abandon. Those who were able rode horses, and the rest walked.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=72–4}}

{{quote box|quote= This day all who were left alive of Mr. Rose's party came into camp, bringing melancholy intelligence.{{sfn|Udell|1946|p=45}}|source=&amp;nbsp;—Udell's journal, August 31, 1858 |width=33%|align=right|style=padding:10px;}}

At approximately 6 p.m., with the wounded in one wagon, the children in the ambulance, and the healthy adults on foot, the Rose company began the difficult journey back to Albuquerque, during which, according to the author Arthur Woodward, they observed a fiery comet that further upset the already frightened children.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baley|2002|pp=72–4}}: the distance from the mountain camp to Albuquerque was approximately {{convert|500|mi}}; {{harvnb|Woodward|1953|p=58}}: the Rose-Baley Party observed a fiery comet that further upset the already frightened children.&lt;/ref&gt; By 10 p.m. the party began to hear war whoops and the clanging of pots and pans coming from the direction of the Colorado River. Baley suggests that the Mohave had returned to "finish them off", but after finding a large cache of supplies celebrated their windfall, which included Rose's eight-dollar-a-bottle brandy. In Baley's opinion, the newfound spoils were likely the only reason the Mohave didn't follow the fleeing wagon train, now en route to rendezvous with the Baley company at their mountain camp.{{sfn|Baley|2002|pp=74–6}}

[[File:Tríptico de Santa Columba, Roger van der Weyden.jpg|thumb|600px|[[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''St Columba Altarpiece''. Oil on oak panel,  138 x 70 cm, 138 x 153 cm, 138 x 70. [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich]]

The '''''Saint Columba Altarpiece'''''  (sometimes '''''Adoration of the Kings''''') is a large c. 1455 oil-on-oak wood [[panel painting|panel]]  [[altarpiece]] by [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Rogier van der Weyden]], now in the [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich.&lt;ref name = "Campbell"&gt;Campbell (1980), 74&lt;/ref&gt; 

The three panels depict a narrative in which [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] is visited by the [[Annunciation|archangel Gabriel]]; she [[Nativity of Jesus|gives birth in a stable]], and she [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|presents the infant at the temple]]. The left wing shows the [[Annunciation]], the center depicts the [[Adoration of the Magi]] after [[Jesus|Christ]]'s birth, and the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|Presentation in the Temple]] appears on the right wing.&lt;ref name = "Campbell"/&gt;

==Panels==

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden 008.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Annunication panel]]
The elegant Annunciation is filled with iconography, such as the faux carving of the [[fall of man]] on the side of the [[prie-dieu]] at which Mary kneels in her devotions. An old-fashioned cross hangs over her head in the center panel's Nativity scene; the donor is placed on the far left, and a sweeping landscape can be seen in the background.&lt;ref name = "Campbell"/&gt; The center panel's far right contains the exterior of the same building shown in the next scene from the inside, juxtaposing the stable with the temple and thereby causing an innovative yet jarring spatial and temporal juxtaposition. The stable is in [[Bethlehem]], the Temple in [[Jerusalem]], yet here they co-exist and function to bridge a gap from the [[Old Testament|Old]] to the [[New Testament]]. It the first Early Netherlandish painting where the building's exterior exists on one panel and its interior on the adjacent panel. Van der Weyden achieved an extremely innovative means of moving a narrative in a continuous fashion in this altarpiece.

==Commission==

The altarpiece was included as part of the 1801 inventory of [[Cologne]]'s Saint Columba cathedral, where it resided in the von dem Wasservass family chapel, which was probably established in the 1460s by Goddert von dem Wasservass, burgomaster of Cologne. It is reasonable to assume such a prominent resident of the city commissioned the piece. According to [[Lorne Campbell (Art historian)|Lorne Campbell]], based on the number of known copies, the piece probably never left the private chapel until 1801.  [[Sulpiz Boisserée|Sulpiz]] and [[Melchior Boisserée|Melchior]] Boisseree bought it in 1808; their collection was acquired in 1827 for the [[Alte Pinakothek]] in Munich.&lt;ref name = "Campbell"/&gt;

==Tales==
Numerous folk tales are told about Sam Hide; one such tale is that of Hide and a deer which illustrates his telling of lies or [[tall tale]]s. In the story, Hide was in search of a glass of (hard) cider, so went to the house of a neighbor and offered, for a [[crown coin]], to tell the man where he had shot and killed a deer. The man, wanting to find the deer meat, counter-offered half a crown, so Hide described a local meadow, then described a tree in that meadow, saying that the deer was to be found under that tree. The man went off to find the deer, but found none and returned home empty handed. Years later, he ran across Hide and accused him of trickery. Hide asked if the man would find it acceptable if an Indian told the truth half the time, and the man said he would. Hide then noted that he had told the truth about there being a meadow, and about there being a tree, just not about there being a deer beneath the tree, and concluded that he had told two truths to one lie, thus ending the matter.

George Lyman Kittredge recounts tales of Hide having faithfully served the English in wars against Indian tribes and earning himself the name of a brave soldier. In one story, Hide is said to have killed 19, of the enemy, and tried hard to make up the 20th, but was unable:

{{blockquote|''On July 3d, 1676, Major Talcott of Connecticut, who was pursuing King Philip in the Narragansett country, after surprising and defeating the enemy in a swamp, turned towards home, at the request of his Mohegan and Pequot allies.  On the way his troops fell in with a party of sixty Indians, ‘all of whom they slew and took’.  One of the prisoners was a ‘young sprightly fellow’, whom his captors, the Mohegans, were allowed to put to death after their own savage fashion.  ‘And indeed’, writes Hubbard, ‘of all the enemies that have been subject of the precedent discourse; this villain did most deserve to become an object of justice and severity; for he boldly told them, that he had with his gun dispatched nineteen, and that he had charged it for the twentieth; but not meeting with any of ours, and unwilling to loose a fair shot, he had let fly at a Mohegan, and kill’d him; with which, having made up his number, he told them he was fully satisfied’.''&lt;ref name="Old Farmer" /&gt;}} 

The claim of the 19 enemy may have been from “Hubbard’s Indian Wars”, 1677 edition.&lt;ref name=Hubbard&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=William|title=Narrative of the Indian Wars in New England (1607-1677)|year=1803|publisher=Heman Willard|location=Stockbridge, Mass|pages=223|url=https://books.google.com/books/reader?id=eBMTAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;output=reader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of the '''settlements of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture''' provides important insights into the early [[history of Europe]]. The [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|Cucuteni-Trypillia culture]], which existed in the present-day [[Southeast Europe|southeastern European]] nations of [[Moldova]], [[Romania]], and [[Ukraine]] during the [[Neolithic|Neolithic Age]] and [[Copper Age]], from approximately 5500 to 2750 BC, left behind thousands of [[Human settlement|settlement]] ruins containing a wealth of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] attesting to their [[Archaeological culture|cultural]] and [[Assemblage (archaeology)|technological]] characteristics.&lt;ref name="Mallory"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Mallory|first1= James P|title= In search of the Indo-Europeans: language, archaeology and myth|year= 1989|publisher= Thames and Hudson|location= London|isbn= 0-500-05052-X|oclc= 246601873}}&lt;/ref&gt; Refer to the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|main article]] for a general description of this culture; this article deals with its [[Human settlement|settlements]].

==Settlements==
The latest research (2014) suggest that some of the largest mega sites contained as many as 3,000 structures and with the possibility of 20,000 to 46,000 inhabitants. [[Maidanets]] may have contained almost 3,000 houses and a population of anything between 12,000 and 46,000 with 29,000 as the average population figure. [[Dobrovody]] and [[Talianki (archaeological site)|Talianki]] are estimated with populations up to 16,200 and 21,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diachenko|first=Aleksandr|author2=Francesco Menotti|title=The gravity model: monitoring the formation and development of the Tripolye culture giant-settlements in Ukraine|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|year=2012|volume=39|pages=2810–2817|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2012.04.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/8641305/High_precision_Tripolye_settlement_plans_demographic_estimations_and_settlement_organization&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.dk/books?id=-3twCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT347&amp;lpg=PT347&amp;dq=Taljanky+15,600%E2%80%9321,000&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SzxLAeB-ph&amp;sig=b6UT9qzqVOlM3nwEcn6SDixnqbQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwji_MvC7KrNAhXHCywKHSKlBDEQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Taljanky%2015%2C600%E2%80%9321%2C000&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of overall size, some of Cucuteni-Trypillia sites, such as [[Talianki (archaeological site)|Talianki]] (with a population of 15,000 and covering an area of some 450 hectares – 1100 acres) in the [[Uman Raion|Uman]] district of Ukraine, are as large as (or perhaps even larger than) the more famous [[city-states]] of [[Sumer]] in the [[Fertile Crescent]], and these Eastern European settlements predate the Sumerian cities by more than half of a millennium. The reason that academicians have not designated the gigantic settlements of Cucuteni-Trypillia culture as "cities", is due to the lack of conclusive evidence for internal social differentiation or specialization.&lt;ref name ="Khol"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Khol | first = Philip L. | title = Archeological transformations: crossing the pastoral/agricultural bridge | journal = Iranica Antiqua | volume = 37 | pages = 151–190 | publisher = E.J.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Trypillia village painting.PNG|thumb|left|Artist's depiction of the Neolithic settlement at Trypillia, Ukraine]] --&gt;
The Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements were usually located on a place where the [[geomorphology]] provided [[natural barrier]]s to protect the site: most notably using high [[Stream terrace|river terraces]] or [[canyon]] edges. The natural barriers were supplemented with [[fence]]s, [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] and [[ditch]]es, or even more elaborate wooden and clay [[Circular rampart|ramparts]].&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Bailey | first = Douglass W. | title = Prehistoric figurines: representation and corporeality in the Neolithic | publisher =  Routledge | year = 2005 | location = London; New York | url = http://www.routledge.com/9780415331517 | oclc = 56686499}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=103}} The role of the fortifications found at these settlements was probably to protect the tribe's domestic animal herd from wild predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Marinescu-Bîlcu | first = Silvia | author-link = | title = Tîrpeşti: from prehistory to history in eastern Romania | journal = |publisher = British archaeological reports (B.A.R.) | series = British archaeological reports international series | volume = 107 | location = Oxford  | year = 1981 | url = http://www.archaeopress.com/defaultBar.asp | language = English |translator-first=Georgeta |translator-last=Bolomey | isbn = 0-86054-125-8 | oclc = 16546798}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other hypotheses are that the fortifications were for protection against enemy attacks, or as a means to gather the community.&lt;ref name="Bailey" /&gt;{{rp|page=112}} The role of these fortifications, however, is still debated among scholars.

The most common arrangement of construction for Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements was to place most of the buildings in a circular pattern surrounding a central structure; some examples of this arrangements were found at Târpeşti, Ioblona, Berezivka, Onoprievka, and Răşcani.&lt;ref name="Bailey" /&gt;{{rp|page=103}} The earliest villages consisted of ten to fifteen wattle-and-daub households. In their heyday, settlements expanded to include several hundred large huts, sometimes with two stories. These houses were typically warmed by an oven, and had round windows. Some of the huts included [[kiln]]s, which were used to fire the distinctive pottery for which the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture is known for.

These settlements underwent periodical acts of destruction and re-creation, as they were burned and then rebuilt every 60–80 years. Some scholars have theorized that the inhabitants of these settlements believed that every house symbolized an organic, almost living, entity. Each house, including its ceramic vases, ovens, figurines and innumerable objects made of perishable materials, shared the same circle of life, and all of the buildings in the settlement were physically linked together as a larger symbolic entity. As with living beings, the settlements may have been seen as also having a life cycle of death and rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Dragoş | last = Gheorghiu | editor-last = Barrowclough | editor-first = David A. | editor2-last = Malone | editor2-first = Caroline | title = Explorations into the conditions of spiritual creativity in prehistoric Malta | chapter = A fire cult in South European Chalcolithic traditions?

As the settlements grew larger, the houses were arranged in two elliptical rows, separated by a space of 70–100 metres (220–320&amp;nbsp;feet). Each household was almost completely self-supportive within these communities, as if instead of being located within a settlement, each family was living away from town and neighbors in the country. There was a lack of public infrastructure within these settlements, which compelled the inhabitants to include all aspects of their lives within their own domicile; ovens, kilns, working, and sleeping areas were all contained within the same space as the family’s sacred altars. Thus the buildings included both the sacred and profane, which some authorities see as evidence to support the idea that the inhabitants viewed their homes as living beings.&lt;ref name="Menotti"&gt;{{Citation | first = Francesco | last = Menotti | author-link = | contribution = The Tripolye house, a sacred and profane coexistence! | contribution-url = http://www.wac6.org/livesite/item.php?itemID=1683&amp;itemType=PAPER | series = 6th [[World Archaeological Congress]] (WAC6) | year = 2007 | place = Dublin | url = http://www.ucd.ie/wac-6/ | oclc = 368044032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of the giant settlements was discovered in the 1960s, when the military topographer K.V. Shishkin noticed the presence of peculiar spots from certain aerial photographs.&lt;ref name="Videĭko" /&gt;

Scholars posit two theories regarding the impetus behind the formation of the large Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements:
:# That they were created in response to the threat of invaders or attacks from people of the open steppes.
:# That they appeared as a result of natural development and growth, which included the threat of inter-tribal warfare from other Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements, as the population growth exerted economic and social pressures on the limited resources of the area.&lt;ref name="Videĭko" /&gt;

Ukrainian archeologist Ivan T. Černjakov credits the large size of some of the Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements to their agricultural system, which was affected by the climatic changes over the years.&lt;ref name="Mantu" /&gt; This can be seen by examining the historic and modern changes in sea level of the nearby Black Sea.&lt;ref name="Mantu"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mantu | first = Cornelia-Magda | title = Cucuteni–Tripolye cultural complex: relations and synchronisms with other contemporaneous cultures from the Black Sea area | journal = Studia Antiqua et Archaeologica | volume = VII | pages = 267 | publisher = Iași University | location = Iași, Romania | year = 2000 | url = http://cisa.uaic.ro/saa/no7.htm | oclc = 228808567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 2009 British-Ukrainian archaeological expedition, organized by John Chapman and Mykhailo Videiko focussed on the 300-ha. mega-site of Nebelivka, Kirovograd domain, enabling the production of a 15-ha. geophysics plot with over 50 burnt structures and a small number of unburnt structures, as well as pits and other anomalies. Remains of one house was excavated. This settlement, dated to BII perion of Trypillia Culture, was the largest around 4000 BC.

With the mega settlements of the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture starting in 4300 BC the period of very large settlements would continue for almost 2000 years. To date (2014) more than 2440 Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements are discovered so far in [[Moldova]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Romania]]. 194 (8%) of these settlements had an area of more than 10 hectares between 5000 - 2700 B.C. and more than 29 settlements had an area in the range 100 - 300 - 450 Hectares and 2800 houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.trypillia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=104:videiko-m-yu-trypillia-culture-proto-cities-after-40-years-of-investigations&amp;catid=54:archaeology&amp;Itemid=66 | work=Videiko M YU | title=Videiko M YU Trypillia culture proto-cities after 40 years of invistigations.

The settlements were primarily administrative, [[military]] and [[religious]] centres and not for [[crafts]]. The typical Trypillia [[hierarchy]] was one dominant "[[capital city|capital]]" with a population up to 15000 people and more than 100 Hectares, this capital was surrounded by [[satellite town]]s typically in the size range 10-40 Hectares and villages in the range of 2-7 Hectares. The Capital controlled territories as far away as 20&amp;nbsp;km (12,5&amp;nbsp;mi) from the center.

Ultimately, the large scale of the Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements may have contributed to the downfall of their society, according to a theory that attributes their collapse to ecological factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Anthony | first = David W. | title = The horse, the wheel, and language: how Bronze Age riders from the Eurasian steppes shaped the modern world | place = Princeton, NJ | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-691-05887-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a dramatic worldwide climate change around 3200 BC, the area of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture would have been plunged into a devastating "[[Dust Bowl]]" type of drought. With their reliance on agriculture to produce food, feeding the many inhabitants of these large-scale settlements would have been unsustainable, leading to the dramatic end of the Cucuteni-Trypillia farming society, and replaced by the more drought-appropriate [[Nomadic pastoralism|pastoral nomadic]] society of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] that followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Todorova | first = Henrietta | editor1-first= Douglass W. | editor1-last= Bailey | editor2-first= Ivan | editor2-last= Panayotov | title = The Neolithic, Eneolithic, and Transitional in Bulgarian prehistory | journal= Prehistoric Bulgaria | series= Monographs in world archaeology | place = Madison, WI | publisher = Prehistoric Press | year = 1995 | issue= 22| pages= 79–98 | isbn = 1-881094-11-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''student fee''' is a [[fee]] charged to students at a school, college, university or other place of learning that is in addition to any [[matriculation]] and/or [[Tuition payments|tuition fee]]s. It may be charged to support [[student organization]]s and [[student activities]] (for which it can be called an '''activity fee''') or for [[:wikt:intercollegiate|intercollegiate]] programs such as [[intramural sports]] or [[Visiting scholar|visiting academic]]s; or, at a [[public university]] or college, as a means to remedy shortfalls in [[Subsidy|state funding]] (in which case it can often be called a '''technology fee'''). Further fees may then be charged for features and facilities such as insurance, health and parking provision.

== United States ==

===Constitutionality of activity fees===
In the United States, the [[constitutionality]] of [[:wikt:mandatory|mandatory]] student activity fees has been adjudicated several times by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. Most recently, the Court has ruled that public universities may subsidize {{clarify span|campus speech|date=February 2015}} by means of a mandatory student activity fees so long as such fees {{clarify span|are allocated to groups with viewpoint neutrality|date=February 2015}} (see ''[[Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System v. Southworth]]'' {{ussc|529|217|2000}}).

'''''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of African American Folklore''''' is a three volume set of books published in December 2005 by [[Greenwood Press]].  It contains roughly 700 alphabetically arranged entries by more than 100 contributors.  It serves as a comprehensive overview of all aspects of [[African-American]] folklore including folktales, music, foodways, spiritual beliefs, and art.&lt;ref&gt; Bob Duckett (2007), [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1589226&amp;show=html&amp;''Reference Reviews''], Vol. 21, Iss: 1, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Western States Folklore Society, reviewed by Ruth Perry, Western Folklore, Vol. 68, No. 4,&amp;nbsp;Fall, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Recommended Reference Books for Small and Medium-Sized Libraries'' 2007, Vol. 27; review by Shannon Graff Hysell.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of African American Folklore'' is unique in being the definitive encyclopedia relating to African-American traditions, background, and mores; a comprehensive overview of [[African-American culture]] and [[folklore]].   It contains alphabetically arranged entries and expert contributors on topics such as [[Folklore|folktales]], music, [[Black Arts Movement|art]], [[foodways]], [[Spirituality|spiritual beliefs]], [[proverbs]], and many other subjects. Entries cite works for further reading and the encyclopedia concludes with a bibliography of major works.

The set of books also gives attention to the [[Caribbean]] and [[Africa]]n roots of traditional African-American culture.  The three volumes are intended to help scholars and students understand the heart of African-American culture and provides a comprehensive context for [[African-American history]], literature, music, and art.

==Reviews==

"The fact that more than 100 entries are devoted to scholars and collectors, among them [[Amiri Baraka|Imamu Amiri Baraka]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], and [[Melville J. Herskovits]], supports a statement Prahlad makes in the introduction. The encyclopedia seeks 'to provide a significant overview of the current study of African American folklore.... [This] first comprehensive general reference work' on African American folklore is highly recommended for academic and public libraries."&lt;ref name="REVIEWS"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Mary Ellen|last=Quinn|publisher=[[American Library Association]]|journal=[[Library Journal Review]] |date=February 1, 2006 |url=http://reviews.libraryjournal.com/?ref=menu |title=Library Journal Reviews — Previews, Reviews, and Collection Development |deadurl=no |accessdate=October 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The multidisciplinary nature of folklore studies is reflected in the list of 140 or so primarily academic contributors, whose areas of expertise include art, literature, anthropology, religion, and more....(the entries) make fascinating reading on topics as diverse as samba, the Sea Islands, sermons, Tupac Shakur, Stagolee, and the steel pan drum...."

'''''The Hedgehog Review''''' is an interdisciplinary [[academic journal]] published triannually by the [[Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture]] (IASC) at the [[University of Virginia]].

The journal features [[Critical thinking|critical writing]] about [[cultural identity]], [[citizenship]], [[cultural change]], and [[cultural diversity]]. Each issue adopts a theme, which the articles address in the form of [[essay]]s, [[interview]]s, annotated [[Bibliography|bibliographies]], and the like.

The Greek lyricist [[Archilochus]] provided the inspiration for the name of the journal, when he wrote this [[aphorism]]: "The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing." Part of the journal's mission statement is to strive "for both the breadth of the fox and the depth of the hedgehog."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6118">'''''The Original Battle Trolls''''' was a brand of [[action figures]] produced by [[Hasbro]] from 1992-1993. They were made in attempt to market the popular concept of [[troll doll]]s to young boys in the early 1990s.

==Overview==
Introduced in 1992 at $4.99 to $6.99,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Battle Trolls taking charge. (What's Selling) | url = https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-13975986.html | publisher = Playthings | date = March 1993 | last = Wanderer | first = Robert | accessdate = 2017-05-20 }} &lt;/ref&gt; the trolls were marketed with the [[Advertising slogan|slogan]] “Big Haired Dudes with Bad Attitudes”&lt;ref name = MetalMisfit&gt;{{cite web | work = Metal Misfit | url = http://metalmisfit.wordpress.com/2007/04/09/from-the-other-blog-trollin-along-singin-a-song/ | date = 2007-04-09 | accessdate = 2007-04-14 | title = From the OTHER blog: Trollin’ along, singin’ a song… }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = VirtualToy&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.virtualtoychest.com/battletrolls/battletrolls.html | title = Virtual Toy Chest's Battle Trolls Archive | date = 2003 | accessdate = 2007-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were actually quite large at approximately 4 3/4 inches tall (not including roughly 4 inches of hair). The line did not establish a [[story arc]] to provide a unifying narrative for the characters as a group. However each individual troll was provided a brief biographical profile (in parody of a [[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero|G.I. Joe file card]]), and, details on their cardbacks as how to properly "neglect" them suggested that the owner hide them in "a dark, smelly place" and keep them "cranky, mean and ready to fight anything or anyone for years!". In association with their tough nature, many of them had facial stitches and their toes poking through their boots.

The line featured 26 individual characters, two of which were [[repaint]]s available in special "vehicle sets". Each Troll featured a single cut joint at the waist and included two handheld accessories. All but four had an accessory designed to launch a projectile by flicking with the finger. The individual characters were styled on either generic action/adventure themes (a pirate, a ninja, two Vikings, a robot, a policeman, a knight, a punk rocker, and a Wild West outlaw); athletes (an American football player, an ice hockey player, a boxer, and a skateboarder); military servicemen (a general, a navy diver, and an air force pilot); monsters (a vampire, Frankenstein's monster, a werewolf, and two cyclopes); or outright [[parody|spoofs]] of famous franchises ([[John Rambo]], the [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]] cyborg, [[Superman]], a [[Mad Max]]-style villain, and [[The Ultimate Warrior]]).

While initially successful, the ''Battle Trolls'' line failed to achieve the popular success that the 'original' troll toys enjoyed. Though much of the line consisted of references to classic fiction and popular culture, it was retired in 1993 after a third, much scarcer run with 8 final characters. A fourth series was planned, but never produced. The [[prototype]]s were displayed at the 1993 [[American International Toy Fair|New York Toy Fair]]. This featured a line of six villains called the ''Evil Horde'', including trolls styled after the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], [[Swamp Thing]], an [[Alien (film series)|Alien]], and one that looked like a hooded executioner. A promotional photo of the group can be viewed online.&lt;ref&gt;Cawiezel, Marc H. [http://www.alienscollection.com/marc.html ''The History of Unproduced Alien and Predator Toys''] (August 2006). Retrieved 2017.05.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Imitations of Battle Trolls were made by competing companies: "Troll Warriors" by ''Tyco'', "Troll Fighter" by ''Simba'', and "Troll Force" by ''Toys 'n Things''.

'''Triumph the Insult Comic Dog''' is a [[puppet]] character puppeteered and voiced by [[Robert Smigel]], best known for mocking celebrities in an [[Eastern Europe]]an accent.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,89428,00.html | title=I Was the Class Comedy Bully | publisher=[[Time magazine]] | date=November 24, 2000 | accessdate=February 18, 2012 | author=[[Josh Tyrangiel|Tyrangiel, Josh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As his name indicates, Triumph's comedic style is almost exclusively [[insult comedy]]. A [[Montenegrin Mountain Hound]], Triumph often puffs a [[cigar]], which usually falls out of his mouth when he starts talking. He debuted in 1997 on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' and also appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'' from time to time, as well as the short-lived ''[[TV Funhouse]]'', [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]]'s ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'', and [[Adult Swim]]'s ''[[The Jack and Triumph Show]]''. Smigel and Triumph have been ejected from several events for Triumph's antics, including Westminster (three times), the Honolulu line for auditions for ''[[American Idol]]'', and the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]] (while shooting an aborted movie project).

==Notable appearances==

{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}

===Debut (Westminster Dog Show)===
[[File:Triumph first appearance.JPG|thumb|right|Triumph's first appearance on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' on February 13, 1997]]
Triumph's debut was in a comedy [[Sketch comedy|skit]] about unusually talented dogs at the [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]] (WKC). In addition to other dog puppets who played [[banjo]]s and performed [[Magic (illusion)|magic]], Triumph appeared in his trademark persona of an obnoxious and ribald [[insult comic]] in the vein of [[Don Rickles]]. The character rapidly grew in popularity, and became a recurring fixture on the show, often mocking the show's [[celebrity]] guests and leaving the studio to sexually harass members of the general public in pre-taped remote segments. On subsequent visits to the WKC,  he would often be found "humping" (attempting to [[canine reproduction|mate]] with), and occasionally being "humped" by other dogs.

===''Star Wars'' fans===
In one widely downloaded {{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  segment, Triumph interviewed ''[[Star Wars]]'' fans waiting in line for the theatrical premiere of ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]''. In that segment, Triumph met Blackwolf the Dragonmaster (who calls himself "New York's unofficial wizard"). Originally visiting the lineup to "pay his respect" to the ''Star Wars'' fans, Blackwolf was spotted by Triumph and cited as being "a [[geek]] from another dimension". Approaching Blackwolf, Triumph quickly associated him as being part of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' fan base (based on Blackwolf's fantasy costume) and then asked, "Have you ever talked to a woman without having to give your [[credit card]] number?" Triumph then pitted a ''Star Wars'' fan (in full [[Jedi]] costume) in a mock duel against Blackwolf and stated that the winner would be declared the "über-dork". Another moment involved a pregnant ''Star Wars'' fan who was also waiting in line.  When told of the baby's expected due date, Triumph responded, "that's the last time he [the baby] will see female genitalia."  Later, while talking to a fan dressed in full [[Darth Vader]] regalia, Triumph directs his attention to the buttons on his chest and remarked, "Which one of these calls your parents to pick you up?"  Eventually irritated by the ''Star Wars'' [[cosplay]] activity, Triumph concludes his day at the ''Star Wars'' lineup by summoning Angry Spock (another ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' character). Dressed as the Vulcan character [[Spock]] (from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise) and possessing a quiet demeanor, Angry Spock promptly and silently proceeds down the lineup and nonchalantly gives everyone [[the finger]]. The segment was shown as part of a series of ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' best-ofs during the final two weeks of that show's run.

=== John Toohey concert ===
Triumph insulted the entire state of [[New Jersey]] when he traveled to the Meadowlands to interview [[Bon Jovi]] on their return to their home state (according to Triumph: "much like poop, returning up into the butthole").  He proceeded to tear down everything the band has done, knocking their age, lack of media ("People have come from as far away as exit 12!"), Jon Bon Jovi's foray into acting ("You're doing a [[Vampires: Los Muertos|vampire movie]], yes? That's good. Finally a role that ''requires'' you to suck!") and even humped [[Heather Locklear]]'s arm. (She was married to Bon Jovi lead guitarist [[Richie Sambora]] at the time). Triumph displayed a mock playlist on the stage consisting of song titles like "Crap", "Poop", "Loads of Crap (ballad version)" and others saying "They haven't closed with "Turd" since 1989!  Awesome!" He visited the "real [[heterosexual]]s" (the road crew) and produced his own [[bong]] made from a doggy [[squeaky toy]] and an [[Alpo (pet food)|Alpo]] can. He, naturally, insulted every drunk fan he could find, knocking the 1980s dress and hair along with the [[blue collar]] and unemployment jokes. For his finale, he got to sing "[[You Give Love a Bad Name (song)|You Give Love a Bad Name]]" with the band and his own words: ''Humped a shar pei/ pulled out too late/ now that bitch has a litter of eight/ they eat all the Alpo, right off my plate/ why the hell didn't I just [[masturbation|masturbate]]?! Oh, I'm a loaded gun!/ Here comes Bon Jovi, the pooping's begun!/ Look at you guys, have you no shame?/ You give poop a bad name! Crawl back in the butt from whence you came!/ You give poop a bad name!''

===2004 presidential campaign===
Triumph filmed a number of segments during the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 US presidential election]] cycle. In November 2003, in the early days of the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. presidential primary campaign]], Triumph was the "lead guest" on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' the same night that Democratic candidate [[John Kerry]] also appeared on the show. Kerry made a dramatic entry, riding his [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle onto the stage; but Triumph, in characteristic style, poked fun at him with a series of scathingly rude remarks, to Kerry's evident discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/la-na-kerry12nov12,1,5252423.story "2 Kerry Officials Quit to Protest Firing of Top Aide"] By Susannah Rosenblatt and Mark Z Barabak, ''[[Los Angeles Times]],'' November 12, 2003 (page A-26)&lt;/ref&gt; (Among his jibes: "The poop I made in the dressing room had more heat than John Kerry!")&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcnews.go.com/sections/politics/TheNote/TheNote_Nov12.html ABCNEWS.com "The Note"], November 12, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

After the third presidential debate, Triumph went on a tour of [[Spin Alley]], the traditional post-debate press briefing in which high-profile members of both parties "in the tradition of [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Baghdad Bob]], and [[Carson Daly]], ladle out poop stew", according to Triumph. During this segment Triumph insulted many notable political strategists, including [[Karl Rove]] ("You're Bush's brains, Karl. I was expecting a much smaller man"), [[Paul Begala]] ("This guy's head was so far up Clinton's butt, they called him The Colonoscope"), and [[Joe Lockhart]] ("Can you spin a woman into thinking you don't look gross in the shower?") In an exchange with conservative commentator [[Ralph E. Reed, Jr.|Ralph Reed]], Triumph tried to ask a question about [[gay marriage]], only to be rebuffed as Reed said, "I don't take questions from dogs." Triumph responded: "Oh, you'll take it, bitch!"{{episode needed|date=September 2014}}

In July and August 2004, Triumph followed up with visits to both major parties' [[United States presidential nominating convention|national conventions]]. During the [[Democratic National Convention]] in [[Boston]] (from which he was ejected), Triumph and [[Michael Moore]] attempted to crash [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]]'s set. O'Reilly, having his makeup applied at the time, shouted, "If I have to come out there, Insult Dog, you're gonna be talking a lot higher than you are now."{{episode needed|date=September 2014}}  He also gained entry to the Republican convention in New York, and even debated actor [[Ron Silver]] during the wrap-up on [[MSNBC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6589736.html "Broadcast Goes 'Convention Lite'"] By David Bianculli, ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]],'' August 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===MTV Video Music Awards===
In addition to regular appearances on ''Late Night with Conan O'Brien'', Triumph has appeared on the [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, including an exchange with [[Jennifer Lopez]] in which he asks Lopez for permission to sniff her butt because "for a dog, it's like climbing [[Mount Everest]]." [[MTV]] later removed the segment from [[Rerun|rebroadcast airings]]. She recalled how her first reaction to the dog was "Get the f*** out of my face!" The following year, Triumph interviewed [[Moby]] and then approached an angry [[Eminem]], prompting MTV to cut away from the segment. Eminem later referred to and impersonated Triumph on the track "[[Ass Like That]]" from his 2004 album ''[[Encore (Eminem album)|Encore]]'', and subsequently appeared in the video, with himself playing Triumph.

===French Canadians in Quebec===
In February 2004, there was a skit where Triumph hurled insults at [[French Canadians]] in [[Quebec]] during ''Late Night''{{'}}s special week of shows taped in [[Toronto, Ontario]]. He poked fun at Quebec nationalism, at one point telling a portly French-Canadian that before separating from Canada he should "try separating [himself] from [[Doughnut|donuts]] first." Triumph also told non-English speakers that he could smell their crotch (in English). When one person walked away from the camera (with a string of curses), Triumph replied, "You are in North America, learn the language!" He also posted signs over existing street signs with such names as "Rue de Pussies", "[[Celine Dion|Celinedion]]sucks Street", and "[[Anne Murray|Annemurray]]sabitch Avenue."

===Michael Jackson trial===
In June 2005, Triumph went to the [[Santa Maria, California|Santa Maria]] courthouse where fans of [[Michael Jackson]] were awaiting the verdict in his [[Trial of Michael Jackson|2005 trial for child molestation]]. "Until the trial is over," reported Triumph, "none of us can really know if Michael is innocent or guilty. But there is one thing we do know... he's guilty!" Triumph also made fun of several foreigners supporting Jackson, including a [[Bulgaria]]n man who was wearing a bright lime-green shirt. In front of the man there was a sign, stating "the only victim is Michael," to which Triumph replied with, "he's not the only fashion victim, I can see that!", and, "[[Soft Cell|Tainted Love]], 'bee bee boop', tainted love," implying the man was wearing a 1980s wardrobe.  He suggested to a female fan that if she really wanted to get Michael's attention she should "wear a nice dress, something low cut, maybe with a six year-old boy on your shoulder."  Upon seeing a Michael Jackson impersonator sing and do the moonwalk, Triumph asked him if he could "do Michael masturbating to ''[[Home Alone]]''."  Also, when one woman mentioned that Michael was running late and came to court in his pajamas, Triumph gasped, "He CAME in his pajamas?" When another woman dressed as a clown refused to speak to Triumph, saying that she did not speak to puppets, Triumph responded, "Right... wouldn't want to compromise your dignity, now would you?"

===Night of Too Many Stars===
On October 15, 2006, Triumph was the closing act for "Night of Too Many Stars: An Overbooked Benefit for Autism Education" at the Beacon Theater in New York.  The show, aired on [[Comedy Central]], was hosted by [[Jon Stewart]] and featured performances by [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Adam Sandler]], [[Jack Black]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Steve Carell]], [[Borat Sagdiyev]] and many other comics. Triumph sang "Come Back" with a group of singers introduced as [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]].  "Come Back" was a plaintive chant bemoaning the loss of certain celebrities from the public eye. Sample lyrics:

''Come back Kathie Lee/I miss your sweatshops so cruel/And your Christmas shows were worse/than finding blood in my stool''

''[[Ben Curtis (actor)|Dell Dude]] career/Please be reborn/You were big for a year/then it was back to gay porn''

Triumph also appeared as part of the 2010 Night of Too Many Stars, which was recorded on October 2 and aired on Comedy Central October 21. Triumph did a routine where he claimed to represent celebrity charities that were unable to be a part of the event. Triumph-autographed cigars were part of the subsequent online celebrity auction.

===2007 Tony Awards===
In June 2007, Triumph visited the [[61st Tony Awards|Tony Awards]] red carpet, or as he described it, "A Who's Who of Who Cares." Given that the already ratings-challenged Tonys were up against the final episode of ''[[The Sopranos]]'', Triumph tried to help out by providing "more popular people" to sneak into the show, including [[Abe Vigoda]], [[Arena Football League]] player [[Aaron Garcia (arena football)|Aaron Garcia]], and "[[2007 tuberculosis scare|The Tuberculosis Guy]]". Finally, Triumph suggested the Tonys incorporate fans more the way the MTV award shows do. He offered two "matinee ladies" (elderly fans who see [[Broadway theatre|Broadway matinees]]) who were willing to make out "with tongue."

===2008 presidential election===
In September 2008, Triumph traveled to [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] to attend that year's Republican National Convention, where he filed a series of reports as he joked around with delegates inside the hall and protesters in the streets outside the convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc.com/Late_Night_with_Conan_O'Brien/video/clips/triumph-at-the-republican-national-convention-part-1-9408/617065 "Triumph at the Republican National Convention"], Part 1 of 3 at NBC.com&lt;/ref&gt; He also conducted a 6½-minute interview (at a hotel across the street) with independent candidate [[Ralph Nader]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc.com/Late_Night_with_Conan_O'Brien/video/clips/triumph-interviews-ralph-nader-91908/669523 "Triumph Interviews Ralph Nader"] at NBC.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, Triumph made an appearance at [[Hofstra University]] in [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, NY]] during the final presidential debate between [[John McCain]] and [[Barack Obama]]. He interviewed and made jokes with political party supporters and with other members of the press, including the host of [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[On the Record with Greta Van Susteren]]'', making a surprise appearance on her show with [[Mr. Met]], the McCain-supporting mascot of the [[New York Mets]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc.com/Late_Night_with_Conan_O'Brien/video/clips/triumph-in-the-presidential-debate-spin-room-101608/775066 "Triumph in the Presidential Debate Spin Room"] at NBC.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Jack and Triumph Show''===
He starred in the short-lived [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[The Jack and Triumph Show]]'', which premiered on February 20, 2015 and lasted until April 3, 2015.

===2016 presidential election===
In February 2016, Triumph starred in ''Triumph's Election Special 2016'', sponsored by [[Hulu]] and [[Funny or Die]], traveling on the election trail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/triumph-the-insult-comic-dog-to-host-hulu-election-special-20160121|title=Triumph the Insult Comic Dog to Host Hulu Election Special|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program went on to be nominated for an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/triumphs-election-special-2016|title=Triumph's Election Special 2016|website=Television Academy|access-date=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, after the election of [[Donald Trump]] as president, Triumph appeared on ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' to discuss Trump's victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leight |first=Elias |date=10 November 2016 |title=Watch Triumph the Insult Comic Dog Explain Trump's Victory on 'Colbert' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/see-triumph-the-insult-comic-dog-explain-trumps-victory-w449650 |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]'' |access-date=10 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other appearances===
Other appearances include [[CBS Television Distribution]]'s ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' live in New York City in 2000, ''[[The Osbournes]]'', and Smigel's ''[[TV Funhouse]]''.

Triumph made a cameo in the 2002 TV film ''[[It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie]]'', insulting [[Kermit the Frog]]. Kermit tells Triumph that he has to do with a little starpower around here, then Triumph tells him, "[[The Muppets|Muppet]] movies are always the best... for me to poop on!"

In November 2005, Triumph hosted "Poopapalooza" at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo Showroom]] in [[Las Vegas]] as the closing act of the initial "The Comedy Festival". Triumph pooped on various Las Vegas performers, including [[Cirque du Soleil]]-style gymnasts, "The Neon Man", and the Michael Jackson impersonator he'd met at the trial. There were also cameos by [[Jon Stewart]], [[Penn &amp; Teller]], [[Lance Burton]] and [[Gilbert Gottfried]].

Triumph appeared as a guest on ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' in 2004, in the penultimate episode.

In 2006, Triumph made an appearance on ''Late Night'' celebrating the Chinese New Year being "The Year of the Dog", stating ''"It's my year!"'' and helping himself to various merchandise in [[New York City]]'s [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]]. He visited a butcher shop and vomited immediately upon tasting a Chinese delicacy. He also made an acupuncturist wear [[BDSM|S&amp;M]] gear.{{episode needed|date=September 2014}}

In March 2006, [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] aired a special, ''The Best of Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog'', consisting of clips from Triumph's ''Best of...'' DVD. Triumph filmed short segments with Blackwolf the Dragonmaster for the special.

On November 3, 2006, O'Brien presented what appeared to be a clip of Triumph on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. Triumph announced he'd been in [[Malawi]] and had adopted a puppy there. He thanked the female audience for their applause and told them they were all going to get vibrators with Oprah's face on them.

On November 14, 2006, Triumph was named an honorary member of the Las Vegas police department's K-9 dog unit. The next night he performed at the Celine Dion Theater, hosting "Poopapalooza 2" with [[Harland Williams]], [[Jim Gaffigan]] and [[Frank Caliendo]].

In September 2007, Triumph was interviewed by [[Phil McGraw|Dr. Phil]] (a mock interview on ''Late Night'') to discuss Triumph's lawsuit against Trouble Helmsley claiming that Trouble ([[Leona Helmsley]]'s dog that inherited $12 million when Helmsley died) is the mother of his child. Triumph asserted that he and Trouble were friends for years, and had pictures to prove it: Triumph humping Trouble on the lawn of the Helmsley estate and in the lobby of the Helmsley Palace, and Triumph getting a hummer from Trouble at Tony Bennett's 80th birthday party. Triumph also brought out their alleged oldest child, Troubleina, and the youngest, named Leona "after the dried-up wrinkly old bitch". (The disposition of this lawsuit is not known.)

Shortly after the resolution of the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], Triumph appeared at the WGA East Awards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/guild/env-et-awards11feb11,0,6150104.story|title=Striking writers put down the signs for a night of fun|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=Jun 11, 2009 |first=Matea |last=Gold |date=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117980615.html|title=Cody, Coen bros. top WGA Awards|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'s Award Central|accessdate=Jun 11, 2009 |first1=Dave |last1=McNary |first2=Sam |last2=Thielman |date=February 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lampooned many of the strike's key figures, as well as the controversy surrounding the decision of late night hosts (such as O'Brien and [[Jay Leno]]) to return to the air in violation of Guild rules:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2008/02/triumph-those-s.html|title=Triumph: 'Those strike rules were a hoot'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=Jun 11, 2009 |date=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;How about our negotiating committee? Where's their award? It couldn't have been easy for them, representing this freak show. Patric Verrone, John Bowman—you know what people don't know about these people? That they're great comedy writers. They are tremendous comedy writers. They've written hilarious material like ''[[Futurama]]'' and ''[[In Living Color]]'' and—the Writers Guild strike rules! The strike rules, ha, prohibit all the writing, ho ho, by any guild member that would be performed on-air by that member, ah ha ha ha, including monologues! Oh ho ho! I can't take it! It's too funny! Oh ho ho ho! The strike rules!

By the way, I want to say, you know, Jay Leno wasn't the only one to make a mockery of these rules. All the talk show hosts did, except my man, Conan O'Brien! Conan O'Brien went out there with no material and sucked harder than ever before!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Triumph has also appeared as a judge on Comedy Central's ''[[The Gong Show with Dave Attell]]''.

In July 2008, Triumph attended the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], not only wandering the floor and speaking to many of the attendees, but also had a ten-minute skit at the start of the [[TV Funhouse]] presentation where, amongst the usual nerd-related gags, he implored everyone present to get to their feet and attempt a jumping jack.

On June 19, 2009, Triumph made his first appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]'', serving as correspondent for the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] in [[Tennessee]]. He referred to festival-goers as dirty hippies on drugs. At the festival, he found a stark-naked [[Max Weinberg]] in a goer's tent.

Triumph appeared on stage at the [[2009 MTV Movie Awards]], alongside [[Zac Efron]] and [[Kiefer Sutherland]] to present [[Ben Stiller]] with the Generation Award.

Triumph has also make a cameo appearance in ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' on the Director's Cut of ''[[Truth or Square]]''.

Triumph appears in a prerecorded bit on O'Brien's [[The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour|2010 Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour]] mocking the town O'Brien is performing in, even though NBC supposedly retained Triumph's rights in the [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|settlement that allowed O'Brien to leave NBC]]. For comedic effect, information about the town is dubbed over. Triumph also gives obviously incorrect facts about the state, for example saying the state animal of Oregon is [[Chip Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daily-reviews.com/conan-obriens-tour-opener-special-guests-jabs-at-nbc/|title=Conan O'Brien's Tour Opener: Special Guests, Jabs At NBC|publisher=Daily Reviews|accessdate=April 14, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708220520/http://www.daily-reviews.com/conan-obriens-tour-opener-special-guests-jabs-at-nbc/|archivedate=July 8, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, Triumph appeared on ''Conan'' as a reporter at the 2012 [[Golden Collar Awards]]. He interviewed and insulted the many dogs in attendance.

In April 2013, Triumph appeared on ''Conan'' in an informal interview he conducted with the ''[[Real Housewives of Atlanta]]''. After fooling them into thinking they were meeting O'Brien, Triumph insulted them on a wide range of topics from his disdain of [[reality television]] to his low opinion of their musical talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gabzGnu6w9A|title=Triumph Visits The Real Housewives Of Atlanta - CONAN on TBS|first=|last=Team Coco|date=4 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, Triumph appeared on ''Conan'' again to report on his visit to the 2013 [[Microbrew]]ery Expo in Colorado. He insulted visitors, brewery owners, and judges while sampling beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcRHUOTNobE|title=Triumph Visits The Great American Beer Festival|first=|last=Team Coco|date=23 October 2013|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Triumph appeared on ''Conan'' again as a correspondent to the [[2014 World Cup]] hosted in [[Brazil]].

In November 2018, Triumph made a couple of appearances on [[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]], covering the [[United States elections, 2018|2018 U.S. midterms]].
Triumph went to Texas to interview [[Beto O'Rourke]] and [[Ted Cruz]].
He came back a few days after the midterms to discuss the election results with [[Stephen Colbert|Colbert]].

==Trademark lawsuit==
In 1999, [[Pets.com]] filed a lawsuit against ''Late Night'' and Robert Smigel after Triumph repeatedly insisted citing the company's sock puppet mascot as being a "rip-off" of Triumph on several TV shows, print media and internet, and after Robert Smigel sent lawsuit threats and cease and desist letters to Pets.com claiming "unfair competition, dilution and potentially tortious interference with contract in violation of federal and state laws".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/dirty-sock-streisands-stocks|title=Dirty Sock &amp; Streisand's Stocks|date=1 July 2010|publisher=|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[bankruptcy]] and closing of the company during the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com bust]] of 2000 ended the lawsuit. During an episode of Saturday Night Live, Triumph humped the [[Pets.com]] dog as an act of revenge in a bathroom.

==Discography==
Triumph's 2003 album, ''[[Come Poop with Me]]'', was released by [[Warner Bros. Records]], and featured adult comedy and songs, plus a bonus [[DVD]] of live performances by Triumph. The album was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Comedy Album. Appearing with Triumph on the album and the DVD were singer-actor [[Jack Black (actor)|Jack Black]], comic actor [[Adam Sandler]], ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' cast members [[Maya Rudolph]] and [[Horatio Sanz]]; Blackwolf the Dragonmaster—a real-life [[fantasy]]/gaming fan who had once been targeted by Triumph during an infamous encounter with ''Star Wars'' fans; and Conan O'Brien.

In Eminem's "Ass Like That", he uses the Triumph puppet to talk his way out of trouble with the police. Triumph himself appears in the video, once again insulting Eminem.

==In popular culture==

*In the video game ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies (video game)|Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', "Triumph, The Insulting Comic Dog" is mentioned in the Special Thanks section of the credits as "Triumph, TICD".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.game-rave.com/psx/playstation_perfect_guide/releasedgames/007_tomo/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508015415/http://www.game-rave.com/psx/playstation_perfect_guide/releasedgames/007_tomo/index.html |archivedate=2012-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
