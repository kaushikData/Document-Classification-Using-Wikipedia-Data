'''Ammonium cyanate''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with the formula NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OCN.  It is a colorless solid.

==Structure and reactions==
The structure of this salt was verified by [[X-ray crystallography]].  The respective C−O and C−N distances are 1.174(8) and 1.192(7) Å, consistent with the O=C=N&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; description.  NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; forms [[hydrogen bond]]s to N, not O.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ammonium cyanate shows N-H···N hydrogen bonding, not N-H···O|authors=MacLean, Elizabeth J.; Harris, Kenneth D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1368">'''Armilenium''' is a C&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; [[carbocation]] and was originally proposed as the first entirely organic [[sandwich compound]]. Named for its resemblance to an [[armillary sphere]], NMR evidence for the carbocation was first described by Melvin J. Goldstein and Stanley A. Klein at [[Cornell University]] in 1973. In subsequent [[Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance|&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR]] experiments by Goldstein and Joseph P. Dinnocenzo in 1984, the C&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; carbocation was generated under stable ion conditions at lower temperature and at higher magnetic field than previously possible.  These experiments revealed the carbocation to be fluxional. Fitting of the dynamic NMR process ruled out the sandwich species even as an intermediate in the 20-fold degenerate rearrangement of the carbocation.

==Backstepping approach==
The backstepping approach provides a [[recursion|recursive]] method for [[Lyapunov stability|stabilizing]] the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] of a system in [[strict-feedback form]]. That is, consider a [[dynamical system|system]] of the form&lt;ref name="Khalil"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\begin{cases}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} &amp;= f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) z_1\\
\dot{z}_1 &amp;= f_1(\mathbf{x},z_1) + g_1(\mathbf{x},z_1) z_2\\
\dot{z}_2 &amp;= f_2(\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) + g_2(\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) z_3\\
\vdots\\
\dot{z}_i &amp;= f_i(\mathbf{x},z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_{i-1}, z_i) + g_i(\mathbf{x},z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_{i-1}, z_i) z_{i+1} \quad \text{ for } 1 \leq i &lt; k-1\\
\vdots\\
\dot{z}_{k-1} &amp;= f_{k-1}(\mathbf{x},z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_{k-1}) + g_{k-1}(\mathbf{x},z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_{k-1}) z_k\\
\dot{z}_k &amp;= f_k(\mathbf{x},z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_{k-1}, z_k) + g_k(\mathbf{x},z_1, z_2, \dots, z_{k-1}, z_k) u
\end{cases}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_i, \ldots, z_{k-1}, z_k&lt;/math&gt; are [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s,
* {{mvar|u}} is a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] input to the system,
* &lt;math&gt;f_x, f_1, f_2, \ldots, f_i, \ldots, f_{k-1}, f_k&lt;/math&gt; [[vanish (mathematics)|vanish]] at the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] (i.e., &lt;math&gt;f_i(0,0,\dots,0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;),
* &lt;math&gt;g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_i, \ldots, g_{k-1}, g_k&lt;/math&gt; are nonzero over the domain of interest (i.e., &lt;math&gt;g_i(\mathbf{x},z_1,\ldots,z_k) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq k&lt;/math&gt;).

Also assume that the subsystem
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) u_x(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;
is [[Lyapunov stability|stabilized]] to the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] (i.e., &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}\,&lt;/math&gt;) by some '''known''' control &lt;math&gt;u_x(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;u_x(\mathbf{0}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. It is also assumed that a [[Lyapunov function]] &lt;math&gt;V_x&lt;/math&gt; for this stable subsystem is known. That is, this {{math|'''x'''}} subsystem is stabilized by some other method and backstepping extends its stability to the &lt;math&gt;\textbf{z}&lt;/math&gt; shell around it.

In systems of this ''strict-feedback form'' around a stable {{math|'''x'''}} subsystem,
* The backstepping-designed control input {{mvar|u}} has its most immediate stabilizing impact on state &lt;math&gt;z_n&lt;/math&gt;.
* The state &lt;math&gt;z_n&lt;/math&gt; then acts like a stabilizing control on the state &lt;math&gt;z_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; before it.
* This process continues so that each state &lt;math&gt;z_i&lt;/math&gt; is stabilized by the ''fictitious'' "control" &lt;math&gt;z_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;.
The '''backstepping''' approach determines how to stabilize the {{math|'''x'''}} subsystem using &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt;, and then proceeds with determining how to make the next state &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt; drive &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; to the control required to stabilize {{math|'''x'''}}. Hence, the process "steps backward" from {{math|'''x'''}} out of the strict-feedback form system until the ultimate control {{mvar|u}} is designed.

==Recursive Control Design Overview==

# It is given that the smaller (i.e., lower-order) subsystem
#::&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) u_x(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;
#:is already stabilized to the origin by some control &lt;math&gt;u_x(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;u_x(\mathbf{0}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. That is, choice of &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt; to stabilize this system must occur using ''some other method.'' It is also assumed that a [[Lyapunov function]] &lt;math&gt;V_x&lt;/math&gt; for this stable subsystem is known. Backstepping provides a way to extend the controlled stability of this subsystem to the larger system.
# A control &lt;math&gt;u_1(\mathbf{x},z_1)&lt;/math&gt; is designed so that the system
#::&lt;math&gt;\dot{z}_1 = f_1(\mathbf{x},z_1) + g_1(\mathbf{x},z_1) u_1(\mathbf{x},z_1)&lt;/math&gt;
#:is stabilized so that &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; follows the desired &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt; control. The control design is based on the augmented Lyapunov function candidate
#::&lt;math&gt;V_1(\mathbf{x},z_1) = V_x(\mathbf{x}) + \frac{1}{2}( z_1 - u_x(\mathbf{x}) )^2&lt;/math&gt;
#:The control &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; can be picked to bound &lt;math&gt;\dot{V}_1&lt;/math&gt; away from zero.
# A control &lt;math&gt;u_2(\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2)&lt;/math&gt; is designed so that the system
#::&lt;math&gt;\dot{z}_2 = f_2(\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) + g_2(\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) u_2(\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2)&lt;/math&gt;
#:is stabilized so that &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt; follows the desired &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; control. The control design is based on the augmented Lyapunov function candidate
#::&lt;math&gt;V_2(\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) = V_1(\mathbf{x},z_1) + \frac{1}{2}( z_2 - u_1(\mathbf{x},z_1) )^2&lt;/math&gt;
#:The control &lt;math&gt;u_2&lt;/math&gt; can be picked to bound &lt;math&gt;\dot{V}_2&lt;/math&gt; away from zero.
# This process continues until the actual {{mvar|u}} is known, and
#* The ''real'' control {{mvar|u}} stabilizes &lt;math&gt;z_k&lt;/math&gt; to ''fictitious'' control &lt;math&gt;u_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
#* The ''fictitious'' control &lt;math&gt;u_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; stabilizes &lt;math&gt;z_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt; to ''fictitious'' control &lt;math&gt;u_{k-2}&lt;/math&gt;.
#* The ''fictitious'' control &lt;math&gt;u_{k-2}&lt;/math&gt; stabilizes &lt;math&gt;z_{k-2}&lt;/math&gt; to ''fictitious'' control &lt;math&gt;u_{k-3}&lt;/math&gt;.
#* ...
#* The ''fictitious'' control &lt;math&gt;u_2&lt;/math&gt; stabilizes &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt; to ''fictitious'' control &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt;.
#* The ''fictitious'' control &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; stabilizes &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; to ''fictitious'' control &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt;.
#* The ''fictitious'' control &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt; stabilizes {{math|'''x'''}} to the origin.

This process is known as '''backstepping''' because it starts with the requirements on some internal subsystem for stability and progressively ''steps back'' out of the system, maintaining stability at each step. Because
* &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; vanish at the origin for &lt;math&gt;0 \leq i \leq k&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;g_i&lt;/math&gt; are nonzero for &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq k&lt;/math&gt;,
* the given control &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;u_x(\mathbf{0}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;,
then the resulting system has an equilibrium at the '''origin''' (i.e., where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z_1=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z_2=0&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;z_{k-1}=0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z_k=0&lt;/math&gt;) that is [[Lyapunov function#Globally asymptotically stable equilibrium|globally asymptotically stable]].

==Integrator Backstepping==

Before describing the backstepping procedure for general [[strict-feedback form]] [[dynamical system]]s, it is convenient to discuss the approach for a smaller class of strict-feedback form systems. These systems connect a series of integrators to the input of a
system with a known feedback-stabilizing control law, and so the stabilizing approach is known as ''integrator backstepping.'' With a small modification, the integrator backstepping approach can be extended to handle all strict-feedback form systems.

===Single-integrator Equilibrium===

Consider the [[dynamical system]]


{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) z_1\\
\dot{z}_1 = u_1
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; is a scalar. This system is a [[cascade connection]] of an [[integrator]] with the {{math|'''x'''}} subsystem (i.e., the input {{mvar|u}} enters an integrator, and the [[integral]] &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; enters the {{math|'''x'''}} subsystem).

We assume that &lt;math&gt;f_x(\mathbf{0})=0&lt;/math&gt;, and so if &lt;math&gt;u_1=0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\underbrace{\mathbf{0}}_{\mathbf{x}}) + ( g_x(\underbrace{\mathbf{0}}_{\mathbf{x}}) )(\underbrace{0}_{z_1}) = 0 + ( g_x(\mathbf{0}) )(0) = \mathbf{0} &amp; \quad \text{ (i.e., } \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} \text{ is stationary)}\\
\dot{z}_1 = \overbrace{0}^{u_1} &amp; \quad \text{ (i.e., } z_1 = 0 \text{ is stationary)}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
So the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x},z_1) = (\mathbf{0},0)&lt;/math&gt; is an equilibrium (i.e., a [[stationary point]]) of the system. If the system ever reaches the origin, it will remain there forever after.

===Single-integrator Backstepping===

In this example, backstepping is used to [[Lyapunov stability|stabilize]] the single-integrator system in Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|1}}) around its equilibrium at the origin. To be less precise, we wish to design a control law &lt;math&gt;u_1(\mathbf{x},z_1)&lt;/math&gt; that ensures that the states &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x}, z_1)&lt;/math&gt; return to &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{0},0)&lt;/math&gt; after the system is started from some arbitrary initial condition.

* First, by assumption, the subsystem

::&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}} = F(\mathbf{x}) \qquad \text{where} \qquad F(\mathbf{x}) \triangleq f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) u_x(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;

:with &lt;math&gt;u_x(\mathbf{0}) = 0&lt;/math&gt; has a [[Lyapunov function]] &lt;math&gt;V_x(\mathbf{x}) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that

::&lt;math&gt;\dot{V}_x=\frac{\partial V_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}}(f_x(\mathbf{x})+g_x(\mathbf{x})u_x(\mathbf{x})) \leq - W(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;W(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; is a [[positive-definite function]]. That is, we '''assume''' that we have '''already shown''' that this '''existing simpler''' {{math|'''x'''}} '''subsystem''' is '''[[Lyapunov stability|stable (in the sense of Lyapunov)]].''' Roughly speaking, this notion of stability means that:
** The function &lt;math&gt;V_x&lt;/math&gt; is like a "generalized energy" of the {{math|'''x'''}} subsystem. As the {{math|'''x'''}} states of the system move away from the origin, the energy &lt;math&gt;V_x(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; also grows.
** By showing that over time, the energy &lt;math&gt;V_x(\mathbf{x}(t))&lt;/math&gt; decays to zero, then the {{math|'''x'''}} states must decay toward &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}\,&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the origin &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}\,&lt;/math&gt; will be a '''stable equilibrium''' of the system – the {{math|'''x'''}} states will continuously approach the origin as time increases.
** Saying that &lt;math&gt;W(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite means that &lt;math&gt;W(\mathbf{x}) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; everywhere except for &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;W(\mathbf{0})=0&lt;/math&gt;.
** The statement that &lt;math&gt;\dot{V}_x \leq -W(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;\dot{V}_x&lt;/math&gt; is bounded away from zero for all points except where &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}\,&lt;/math&gt;. That is, so long as the system is not at its equilibrium at the origin, its "energy" will be decreasing.
** Because the energy is always decaying, then the system must be stable; its trajectories must approach the origin.
:Our task is to find a control {{mvar|u}} that makes our cascaded &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x},z_1)&lt;/math&gt; system also stable. So we must find a ''new'' Lyapunov function '''candidate''' for this new system. That candidate will depend upon the control {{mvar|u}}, and by choosing the control properly, we can ensure that it is decaying everywhere as well.

* Next, by ''adding'' '''and''' ''subtracting'' &lt;math&gt;g_x(\mathbf{x}) u_x(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., we don't change the system in any way because we make no ''net'' effect) to the &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}&lt;/math&gt; part of the larger &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x},z_1)&lt;/math&gt; system, it becomes

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) z_1 + \mathord{\underbrace{\left( g_x(\mathbf{x})u_x(\mathbf{x}) - g_x(\mathbf{x})u_x(\mathbf{x}) \right)}_{0}}\\\dot{z}_1 = u_1\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

:which we can re-group to get

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\dot{x} = \mathord{\underbrace{\left( f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x})u_x(\mathbf{x}) \right)}_{F(\mathbf{x})}} + g_x(\mathbf{x}) \underbrace{\left( z_1 - u_x(\mathbf{x}) \right)}_{z_1 \text{ error tracking } u_x}\\\dot{z}_1 = u_1\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

:So our cascaded supersystem encapsulates the known-stable &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}} = F(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; subsystem plus some error perturbation generated by the integrator.

* We now can change variables from &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x}, z_1)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x}, e_1)&lt;/math&gt; by letting &lt;math&gt;e_1 \triangleq z_1 - u_x(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;. So

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\dot{\mathbf{x}} = (f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) u_x(\mathbf{x})) +
g_x(\mathbf{x}) e_1\\\dot{e}_1 = u_1 - \dot{u}_x\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

: Additionally, we let &lt;math&gt;v_1 \triangleq u_1 - \dot{u}_x&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;u_1 = v_1 + \dot{u}_x&lt;/math&gt; and

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\dot{\mathbf{x}} = (f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) u_x(\mathbf{x}))+g_x(\mathbf{x}) e_1\\\dot{e}_1 = v_1\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

: We seek to stabilize this '''error system''' by feedback through the new control &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt;. By stabilizing the system at &lt;math&gt;e_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the state &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; will track the desired control &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt; which will result in stabilizing the inner {{math|'''x'''}} subsystem.

* From our existing Lyapunov function &lt;math&gt;V_x&lt;/math&gt;, we define the ''augmented'' Lyapunov function ''candidate''

::&lt;math&gt;V_1(\mathbf{x}, e_1) \triangleq V_x(\mathbf{x}) + \frac{1}{2} e_1^2&lt;/math&gt;

: So

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{V}_1
&amp;= \dot{V}_x(\mathbf{x}) + \frac{1}{2}\left( 2 e_1 \dot{e}_1 \right)\\
&amp;= \dot{V}_x(\mathbf{x}) + e_1 \dot{e}_1\\
&amp;= \dot{V}_x(\mathbf{x}) + e_1 \overbrace{v_1}^{\dot{e}_1}\\
&amp;= \overbrace{\frac{\partial V_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \underbrace{\dot{\mathbf{x}}}_{\text{(i.e., }\frac{\operatorname{d}\mathbf{x}}{\operatorname{d}t}\text{)}}}^{\dot{V}_x\text{ (i.e.,} \frac{\operatorname{d}V_x}{\operatorname{d}t}\text{)}} + e_1 v_1\\
&amp;= \overbrace{\frac{\partial V_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \underbrace{\left( (f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x})u_x(\mathbf{x})) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) e_1 \right)}_{\dot{\mathbf{x}}}}^{\dot{V}_x} + e_1 v_1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

: By distributing &lt;math&gt;\partial V_x/\partial \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;, we see that

::&lt;math&gt;\dot{V}_1 = \overbrace{\frac{\partial V_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}}(f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) u_x(\mathbf{x}))}^{{} \leq -W(\mathbf{x})} + \frac{\partial V_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}}g_x(\mathbf{x}) e_1 + e_1 v_1 \leq -W(\mathbf{x})+ \frac{\partial V_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}} g_x(\mathbf{x}) e_1 + e_1 v_1&lt;/math&gt;

: To ensure that &lt;math&gt;\dot{V}_1 \leq -W(\mathbf{x}) &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., to ensure stability of the supersystem), we '''pick''' the control law

::&lt;math&gt;v_1 = -\frac{\partial V_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}}g_x(\mathbf{x})- k_1 e_1&lt;/math&gt;

: with &lt;math&gt;k_1 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, and so

::&lt;math&gt;\dot{V}_1
= -W(\mathbf{x}) + \frac{\partial V_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}} g_x(\mathbf{x}) e_1 + e_1\overbrace{\left( -\frac{\partial V_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}}g_x(\mathbf{x})-k_1 e_1 \right)}^{v_1}&lt;/math&gt;

: After distributing the &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt; through,

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{V}_1
&amp; = 
-W(\mathbf{x}) + \mathord{\overbrace{\frac{\partial V_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}} g_x(\mathbf{x}) e_1
- e_1 \frac{\partial V_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}}g_x(\mathbf{x})}^{0}} - k_1 e_1^2\\
&amp;= -W(\mathbf{x})-k_1 e_1^2 \leq -W(\mathbf{x})\\
&amp;&lt; 0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

: So our ''candidate'' Lyapunov function &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; '''is''' a true [[Lyapunov function]], and our system is '''stable''' under this control law &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; (which corresponds the control law &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;v_1 \triangleq u_1 - \dot{u}_x&lt;/math&gt;). Using the variables from the original coordinate system, the equivalent Lyapunov function
:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;V_1(\mathbf{x}, z_1) \triangleq V_x(\mathbf{x}) + \frac{1}{2} ( z_1 - u_x(\mathbf{x}) )^2&lt;/math&gt;
| {{EquationRef|2}}}}


: As discussed below, this Lyapunov function will be used again when this procedure is applied iteratively to multiple-integrator problem.

* Our choice of control &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; ultimately depends on all of our original state variables. In particular, the actual feedback-stabilizing control law
:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\underbrace{u_1(\mathbf{x},z_1)=v_1+\dot{u}_x}_{\text{By definition of }v_1}=\overbrace{-\frac{\partial V_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}}g_x(\mathbf{x})-k_1(\underbrace{z_1-u_x(\mathbf{x})}_{e_1})}^{v_1} \, + \, \overbrace{\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}}(\underbrace{f_x(\mathbf{x})+g_x(\mathbf{x})z_1}_{\dot{\mathbf{x}} \text{ (i.e., } \frac{\operatorname{d}\mathbf{x}}{\operatorname{d}t} \text{)}})}^{\dot{u}_x \text{ (i.e., } \frac{ \operatorname{d}u_x }{\operatorname{d}t} \text{)}}&lt;/math&gt;
| {{EquationRef|3}}}}


: The states {{math|'''x'''}} and &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; and functions &lt;math&gt;f_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_x&lt;/math&gt; come from the system. The function &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt; comes from our known-stable &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}=F(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; subsystem. The '''gain''' parameter &lt;math&gt;k_1 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; affects the convergence rate or our system. Under this control law, our system is [[Lyapunov stability|stable]] at the origin &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x},z_1)=(\mathbf{0},0)&lt;/math&gt;.

: Recall that &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; in Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|3}}) drives the input of an integrator that is connected to a subsystem that is feedback-stabilized by the control law &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt;. Not surprisingly, the control &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; has a &lt;math&gt;\dot{u}_x&lt;/math&gt; term that will be integrated to follow the stabilizing control law &lt;math&gt;\dot{u}_x&lt;/math&gt; plus some offset. The other terms provide damping to remove that offset and any other perturbation effects that would be magnified by the integrator.

So because this system is feedback stabilized by &lt;math&gt;u_1(\mathbf{x}, z_1)&lt;/math&gt; and has Lyapunov function &lt;math&gt;V_1(\mathbf{x},z_1)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\dot{V}_1(\mathbf{x}, z_1) \leq -W(\mathbf{x}) &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, it can be used as the upper subsystem in another single-integrator cascade system.

===Motivating Example: Two-integrator Backstepping===
Before discussing the recursive procedure for the general multiple-integrator case, it is instructive to study the recursion present in the two-integrator case. That is, consider the [[dynamical system]]


{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) z_1\\
\dot{z}_1 = z_2\\
\dot{z}_2 = u_2
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
| {{EquationRef|4}}}}


where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt; are scalars. This system is a cascade connection of the single-integrator system in Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|1}}) with another integrator (i.e., the input &lt;math&gt;u_2&lt;/math&gt; enters through an integrator, and the output of that integrator enters the system in Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|1}}) by its &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; input).

By letting
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y} \triangleq \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{x} \\ z_1 \end{bmatrix}\,&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;f_y(\mathbf{y}) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix} f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) z_1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\,&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;g_y(\mathbf{y}) \triangleq \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{0}\\ 1 \end{bmatrix},\,&lt;/math&gt;
then the two-integrator system in Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|4}}) becomes the single-integrator system


{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\dot{\mathbf{y}} = f_y(\mathbf{y}) + g_y(\mathbf{y}) z_2 &amp;\quad \text{( where this } \mathbf{y} \text{ subsystem is stabilized by } z_2 = u_1(\mathbf{x},z_1) \text{ )}\\
\dot{z}_2 = u_2.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
| {{EquationRef|5}}}}


By the single-integrator procedure, the control law &lt;math&gt;u_y(\mathbf{y}) \triangleq u_1(\mathbf{x},z_1)&lt;/math&gt; stabilizes the upper &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt;-to-{{math|'''y'''}} subsystem using the Lyapunov function &lt;math&gt;V_1(\mathbf{x},z_1)&lt;/math&gt;, and so Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|5}}) is a new single-integrator system that is structurally equivalent to the single-integrator system in Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|1}}). So a stabilizing control &lt;math&gt;u_2&lt;/math&gt; can be found using the same single-integrator procedure that was used to find &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt;.

===Many-integrator backstepping===

In the two-integrator case, the upper single-integrator subsystem was stabilized yielding a new single-integrator system that can be similarly stabilized. This recursive procedure can be extended to handle any finite number of integrators. This claim can be formally proved with [[mathematical induction]]. Here, a stabilized multiple-integrator system is built up from subsystems of already-stabilized multiple-integrator subsystems.

* First, consider the [[dynamical system]]
::&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) u_x&lt;/math&gt;
:that has scalar input &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt; and output states &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]^{\text{T}} \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;. Assume that
**&lt;math&gt;f_x(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; so that the zero-input (i.e., &lt;math&gt;u_x = 0&lt;/math&gt;) system is [[stationary point|stationary]] at the origin &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}\,&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, the origin is called an ''equilibrium'' of the system.
**The feedback control law &lt;math&gt;u_x(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; stabilizes the system at the equilibrium at the origin.
**A [[Lyapunov function]] corresponding to this system is described by &lt;math&gt;V_x(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;.
:That is, if output states {{math|'''x'''}} are fed back to the input &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt; by the control law &lt;math&gt;u_x(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;, then the output states (and the Lyapunov function) return to the origin after a single perturbation (e.g., after a nonzero initial condition or a sharp disturbance). This subsystem is '''stabilized''' by feedback control law &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt;.

* Next, connect an [[integrator]] to input &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt; so that the augmented system has input &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; (to the integrator) and output states {{math|'''x'''}}. The resulting augmented dynamical system is
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) z_1\\
\dot{z}_1 = u_1
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:This "cascade" system matches the form in Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|1}}), and so the single-integrator backstepping procedure leads to the stabilizing control law in Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|3}}). That is, if we feed back states &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; and {{math|'''x'''}} to input &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; according to the control law
::&lt;math&gt;u_1(\mathbf{x},z_1)=-\frac{\partial V_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}}g_x(\mathbf{x})-k_1(z_1-u_x(\mathbf{x})) + \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}}(f_x(\mathbf{x})+g_x(\mathbf{x})z_1)&lt;/math&gt;
: with gain &lt;math&gt;k_1 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the states &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; and {{math|'''x'''}} will return to &lt;math&gt;z_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}\,&lt;/math&gt; after a single perturbation. This subsystem is '''stabilized''' by feedback control law &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt;, and the corresponding Lyapunov function from Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|2}}) is
::&lt;math&gt;V_1(\mathbf{x},z_1) = V_x(\mathbf{x}) + \frac{1}{2}( z_1 - u_x(\mathbf{x}) )^2&lt;/math&gt;
:That is, under feedback control law &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt;, the Lyapunov function &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; decays to zero as the states return to the origin.

* Connect a new integrator to input &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; so that the augmented system has input &lt;math&gt;u_2&lt;/math&gt; and output states {{math|'''x'''}}. The resulting augmented dynamical system is
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) z_1\\
\dot{z}_1 = z_2\\
\dot{z}_2 = u_2
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:which is equivalent to the ''single''-integrator system
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\overbrace{ \begin{bmatrix} \dot{\mathbf{x}}\\ \dot{z}_1 \end{bmatrix} }^{\triangleq \, \dot{\mathbf{x}}_1}
= 
\overbrace{ \begin{bmatrix} f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) z_1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} }^{\triangleq \, f_1(\mathbf{x}_1)}
+
\overbrace{ \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{0}\\ 1\end{bmatrix} }^{\triangleq \, g_1(\mathbf{x}_1)} z_2 &amp;\qquad \text{ ( by Lyapunov function } V_1, \text{ subsystem stabilized by } u_1(\textbf{x}_1) \text{ )}\\
\dot{z}_2 = u_2
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:Using these definitions of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;g_1&lt;/math&gt;, this system can also be expressed as
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\dot{\mathbf{x}}_1 = f_1(\mathbf{x}_1) + g_1(\mathbf{x}_1) z_2 &amp;\qquad \text{ ( by Lyapunov function } V_1, \text{ subsystem stabilized by } u_1(\textbf{x}_1) \text{ )}\\
\dot{z}_2 = u_2
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:This system matches the single-integrator structure of Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|1}}), and so the single-integrator backstepping procedure can be applied again. That is, if we feed back states &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt;, and {{math|'''x'''}} to input &lt;math&gt;u_2&lt;/math&gt; according to the control law
::&lt;math&gt;u_2(\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2)=-\frac{\partial V_1}{\partial \mathbf{x}_1 } g_1(\mathbf{x}_1)-k_2(z_2-u_1(\mathbf{x}_1)) + \frac{\partial u_1}{\partial \mathbf{x}_1}(f_1(\mathbf{x}_1)+g_1(\mathbf{x}_1)z_2)&lt;/math&gt;
:with gain &lt;math&gt;k_2 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the states &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt;, and {{math|'''x'''}} will return to &lt;math&gt;z_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}\,&lt;/math&gt; after a single perturbation. This subsystem is '''stabilized''' by feedback control law &lt;math&gt;u_2&lt;/math&gt;, and the corresponding Lyapunov function is
::&lt;math&gt;V_2(\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2) = V_1(\mathbf{x}_1) + \frac{1}{2}( z_2 - u_1(\mathbf{x}_1) )^2&lt;/math&gt;
:That is, under feedback control law &lt;math&gt;u_2&lt;/math&gt;, the Lyapunov function &lt;math&gt;V_2&lt;/math&gt; decays to zero as the states return to the origin.

* Connect an integrator to input &lt;math&gt;u_2&lt;/math&gt; so that the augmented system has input &lt;math&gt;u_3&lt;/math&gt; and output states {{math|'''x'''}}. The resulting augmented dynamical system is
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) z_1\\
\dot{z}_1 = z_2\\
\dot{z}_2 = z_3\\
\dot{z}_3 = u_3
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:which can be re-grouped as the ''single''-integrator system
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\overbrace{ \begin{bmatrix} \dot{\mathbf{x}}\\ \dot{z}_1\\ \dot{z}_2 \end{bmatrix} }^{\triangleq \, \dot{\mathbf{x}}_2}
=

\dot{z}_3 = u_3
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:By the definitions of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;g_1&lt;/math&gt; from the previous step, this system is also represented by
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}

\overbrace{ \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{0}\\ 1\end{bmatrix} }^{g_2(\mathbf{x}_2)} z_3 &amp;\qquad \text{ ( by Lyapunov function } V_2, \text{ subsystem stabilized by } u_2(\textbf{x}_2) \text{ )}\\
\dot{z}_3 = u_3
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:Further, using these definitions of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;g_2&lt;/math&gt;, this system can also be expressed as
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\dot{\mathbf{x}}_2 = f_2(\mathbf{x}_2) + g_2(\mathbf{x}_2) z_3 &amp;\qquad \text{ ( by Lyapunov function } V_2, \text{ subsystem stabilized by } u_2(\textbf{x}_2) \text{ )}\\
\dot{z}_3 = u_3
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:So the re-grouped system has the single-integrator structure of Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|1}}), and so the single-integrator backstepping procedure can be applied again. That is, if we feed back states &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z_3&lt;/math&gt;, and {{math|'''x'''}} to input &lt;math&gt;u_3&lt;/math&gt; according to the control law
::&lt;math&gt;u_3(\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2,z_3)=-\frac{\partial V_2}{\partial \mathbf{x}_2 } g_2(\mathbf{x}_2)-k_3(z_3-u_2(\mathbf{x}_2)) + \frac{\partial u_2}{\partial \mathbf{x}_2}(f_2(\mathbf{x}_2)+g_2(\mathbf{x}_2)z_3)&lt;/math&gt;
:with gain &lt;math&gt;k_3 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the states &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z_3&lt;/math&gt;, and {{math|'''x'''}} will return to &lt;math&gt;z_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;z_3 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}\,&lt;/math&gt; after a single perturbation. This subsystem is '''stabilized''' by feedback control law &lt;math&gt;u_3&lt;/math&gt;, and the corresponding Lyapunov function is
::&lt;math&gt;V_3(\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2,z_3) = V_2(\mathbf{x}_2) + \frac{1}{2}( z_3 - u_2(\mathbf{x}_2) )^2&lt;/math&gt;
:That is, under feedback control law &lt;math&gt;u_3&lt;/math&gt;, the Lyapunov function &lt;math&gt;V_3&lt;/math&gt; decays to zero as the states return to the origin.

At iteration {{mvar|i}}, the equivalent system is
::&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\overbrace{ \begin{bmatrix} \dot{\mathbf{x}}\\ \dot{z}_1\\ \dot{z}_2 \\ \vdots \\ \dot{z}_{i-2} \\ \dot{z}_{i-1} \end{bmatrix} }^{\triangleq \, \dot{\mathbf{x}}_{i-1}}
= 
\overbrace{ \begin{bmatrix} f_{i-2}(\mathbf{x}_{i-2}) + g_{i-2}(\mathbf{x}_{i-1}) z_{i-2} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} }^{\triangleq \, f_{i-1}(\mathbf{x}_{i-1})}
+
\overbrace{ \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{0}\\ 1\end{bmatrix} }^{\triangleq \, g_{i-1}(\mathbf{x}_{i-1})} z_i &amp;\quad \text{ ( by Lyap. func. } V_{i-1}, \text{ subsystem stabilized by } u_{i-1}(\textbf{x}_{i-1}) \text{ )}\\
\dot{z}_i = u_i
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:The corresponding feedback-stabilizing control law is
::&lt;math&gt;u_i(\overbrace{\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2,\dots,z_i}^{\triangleq \, \mathbf{x}_i})=-\frac{\partial V_{i-1}}{\partial \mathbf{x}_{i-1} } g_{i-1}(\mathbf{x}_{i-1}) \, - \, k_i(z_i \, - \, u_{i-1}(\mathbf{x}_{i-1})) \, + \, \frac{\partial u_{i-1}}{\partial \mathbf{x}_{i-1}}(f_{i-1}(\mathbf{x}_{i-1}) \, + \, g_{i-1}(\mathbf{x}_{i-1})z_i)&lt;/math&gt;
:with gain &lt;math&gt;k_i &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding Lyapunov function is
::&lt;math&gt;V_i(\mathbf{x}_i) = V_{i-1}(\mathbf{x}_{i-1}) + \frac{1}{2}( z_i - u_{i-1}(\mathbf{x}_{i-1}) )^2&lt;/math&gt;
:By this construction, the ultimate control &lt;math&gt;u(\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_k) = u_k(\mathbf{x}_k)&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., ultimate control is found at final iteration &lt;math&gt;i=k&lt;/math&gt;).
Hence, any system in this special many-integrator strict-feedback form can be feedback stabilized using a straightforward procedure that can even be automated (e.g., as part of an [[adaptive control]] algorithm).

==Generic Backstepping==

Systems in the special [[strict-feedback form]] have a recursive structure similar to the many-integrator system structure. Likewise, they are stabilized by stabilizing the smallest cascaded system and then ''backstepping'' to the next cascaded system and repeating the procedure. So it is critical to develop a single-step procedure; that procedure can be recursively applied to cover the many-step case. Fortunately, due to the requirements on the functions in the strict-feedback form, each single-step system can be rendered by feedback to a single-integrator system, and that single-integrator system can be stabilized using methods discussed above.

===Single-step Procedure===

Consider the simple [[strict-feedback form|strict-feedback]] [[dynamical system|system]]


{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) z_1\\
\dot{z}_1 = f_1(\mathbf{x}, z_1) + g_1(\mathbf{x}, z_1) u_1
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
| {{EquationRef|6}}}}


where
* &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]^{\text{T}} \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; are [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s,
* For all {{math|'''x'''}} and &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_1(\mathbf{x},z_1) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
Rather than designing feedback-stabilizing control &lt;math&gt;u_1&lt;/math&gt; directly, introduce a new control &lt;math&gt;u_{a1}&lt;/math&gt; (to be designed ''later'') and use control law
:&lt;math&gt;u_1( \mathbf{x}, z_1 )
= 
\frac{ 1 }{ g_1( \mathbf{x}, z_1 ) }
\left( u_{a1} - f_1(\mathbf{x},z_1) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
which is possible because &lt;math&gt;g_1 \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. So the system in Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|6}}) is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) z_1\\
\dot{z}_1 = f_1(\mathbf{x}, z_1) + g_1(\mathbf{x}, z_1) \overbrace{\frac{ 1 }{ g_1( \mathbf{x}, z_1 ) }
\left( u_{a1} - f_1(\mathbf{x},z_1) \right)}^{u_1(\mathbf{x}, z_1)}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
which simplifies to
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = f_x(\mathbf{x}) + g_x(\mathbf{x}) z_1\\
\dot{z}_1 = u_{a1}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
This new &lt;math&gt;u_{a1}&lt;/math&gt;-to-{{math|'''x'''}} system matches the ''single-integrator cascade system'' in Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|1}}). Assuming that a feedback-stabilizing control law &lt;math&gt;u_x(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; and [[Lyapunov function]] &lt;math&gt;V_x(\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt; for the upper subsystem is known, the feedback-stabilizing control law from Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|3}}) is
:&lt;math&gt;u_{a1}(\mathbf{x},z_1)=-\frac{\partial V_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}}g_x(\mathbf{x})-k_1(z_1-u_x(\mathbf{x})) + \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}}(f_x(\mathbf{x})+g_x(\mathbf{x})z_1)&lt;/math&gt;
with gain &lt;math&gt;k_1 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. So the final feedback-stabilizing control law is


{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;u_1(\mathbf{x},z_1) = \frac{1}{ g_1(\mathbf{x},z_1) } \left( \overbrace{-\frac{\partial V_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}}g_x(\mathbf{x})-k_1(z_1-u_x(\mathbf{x})) + \frac{\partial u_x}{\partial \mathbf{x}}(f_x(\mathbf{x})+g_x(\mathbf{x})z_1)}^{u_{a1}(\mathbf{x},z_1)} \, - \, f_1(\mathbf{x}, z_1) \right)&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; (7)\,&lt;/math&gt;


with gain &lt;math&gt;k_1 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding Lyapunov function from Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|2}}) is


{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;V_1(\mathbf{x},z_1) = V_x(\mathbf{x}) + \frac{1}{2} ( z_1 - u_x(\mathbf{x}) )^2&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; (8)\,&lt;/math&gt;


Because this ''strict-feedback system'' has a feedback-stabilizing control and a corresponding Lyapunov function, it can be cascaded as part of a larger strict-feedback system, and this procedure can be repeated to find the surrounding feedback-stabilizing control.

===Many-step Procedure===

As in many-integrator backstepping, the single-step procedure can be completed iteratively to stabilize an entire strict-feedback system. In each step,
# The smallest "unstabilized" single-step strict-feedback system is isolated.
# Feedback is used to convert the system into a single-integrator system.
# The resulting single-integrator system is stabilized.
# The stabilized system is used as the upper system in the next step.
That is, any ''strict-feedback system''

\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
and can be feedback stabilized by finding the feedback-stabilizing control and Lyapunov function for the single-integrator &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{x},z_1)&lt;/math&gt; subsystem (i.e., with input &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt; and output {{math|'''x'''}}) and iterating out from that inner subsystem until the ultimate feedback-stabilizing control {{mvar|u}} is known. At iteration {{mvar|i}}, the equivalent system is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\overbrace{ \begin{bmatrix} \dot{\mathbf{x}}\\ \dot{z}_1\\ \dot{z}_2 \\ \vdots \\ \dot{z}_{i-2} \\ \dot{z}_{i-1} \end{bmatrix} }^{\triangleq \, \dot{\mathbf{x}}_{i-1}}
= 
\overbrace{ \begin{bmatrix} f_{i-2}(\mathbf{x}_{i-2}) + g_{i-2}(\mathbf{x}_{i-2}) z_{i-2} \\ f_{i-1}(\mathbf{x}_i) \end{bmatrix} }^{\triangleq \, f_{i-1}(\mathbf{x}_{i-1})}

By Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|7}}), the corresponding feedback-stabilizing control law is

\, - \,
f_i( \mathbf{x}_{i-1} )
\right)&lt;/math&gt;
with gain &lt;math&gt;k_i &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. By Equation&amp;nbsp;({{EquationNote|8}}), the corresponding Lyapunov function is
:&lt;math&gt;V_i(\mathbf{x}_i) = V_{i-1}(\mathbf{x}_{i-1}) + \frac{1}{2} ( z_i - u_{i-1}(\mathbf{x}_{i-1}) )^2&lt;/math&gt;
By this construction, the ultimate control &lt;math&gt;u(\mathbf{x},z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_k) = u_k(\mathbf{x}_k)&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., ultimate control is found at final iteration &lt;math&gt;i=k&lt;/math&gt;).
Hence, any strict-feedback system can be feedback stabilized using a straightforward procedure that can even be automated (e.g., as part of an [[adaptive control]] algorithm).

'''Behavioral enrichment''' (also referred to as '''environmental enrichment''') is an [[animal husbandry]] principle that seeks to enhance the quality of captive animal care by identifying and providing the environmental stimuli necessary for optimal psychological and physiological [[Quality of life|well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;Shepherdson, D.J. (1998) “Tracing the path of environmental enrichment in zoos” in Shepherdson, D.J., Mellen, J.D. and Hutchins, M. (1998) Second Nature – Environmental Enrichment for Captive Animals, 1st Edition, Smithsonian Institution Press, London, UK, pp. 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental enrichment can either be active or passive, depending on whether it requires direct contact between the animal and the enrichment. A variety of enrichment techniques are used to create desired outcomes similar to an animals individual and species' history. Each of the techniques used are intended to stimulate the animal's senses similarly to how they would be activated in the wild. Provided enrichment may be seen in the form of auditory, olfactory, habitat factors, food, research projects, training, and objects.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nationalzoo.si.edu/SCBI/AnimalEnrichment/|title=Animal Enrichment - National Zoo|website=nationalzoo.si.edu|access-date=2016-03-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401200044/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/SCBI/AnimalEnrichment/|archive-date=2016-04-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
Environmental enrichment improves the overall welfare of animals in captivity and creates a habitat similar to what they would experience in their wild environment. It can aims to maintain an animal's physical and psychological health by increasing the range or number of species-specific behaviors, increasing positive interaction with the captive environment, preventing or reducing the frequency of [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|abnormal behaviors]], such as [[Stereotypy (non-human)|stereotypies]], and increasing the individual's ability to cope with the challenges of captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stlzoo.org/animals/enrichmenttraining/animalenrichment/|title=Animal Enrichment :: Saint Louis Zoo|website=www.stlzoo.org |access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental enrichment can be offered to any animal in captivity, including:

Environmental enrichment can be beneficial to a wide range of vertebrates and invertebrates such as land [[mammal]]s, [[marine mammal]]s, and [[amphibian]]s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ammpa.org/faqs.html#5|title=Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums|website=www.ammpa.org|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, specific regulations ([[Animal Welfare Act of 1966]]) must be followed for enrichment plans in order to guarantee, regulate, and provide appropriate living environments and stimulation for animals in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kulpa-Eddy JA, Taylor S, Adams KM | title = USDA perspective on environmental enrichment for animals | journal = ILAR Journal | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 83–94 | date = 2005-01-01 | pmid = 15775018 | doi = 10.1093/ilar.46.2.83 | url = http://ilarjournal.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/2/83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (also known as the AZA), requires that [[animal husbandry]] and welfare be a main concern for those caring for animals in captivity.

== Passive enrichment ==
Passive enrichment provides sensory stimulation but no direct contact or control. This type of enrichment is commonly used for its potential to benefit several animals simultaneously as well as requiring limited direct animal contact.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meade TM, Hutchinson E, Krall C, Watson J | title = Use of an aquarium as a novel enrichment item for singly housed rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) | journal = Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science | volume = 53 | issue = 5 | pages = 472–7 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25255069 | pmc = 4181688 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual enrichment ===
Visual enrichment is typically provided by changing the layout of an animal's holding area. The type of visual enrichment can vary, from something as simple as adding pictures on walls to videotapes and television. Visual enrichment such as television can especially benefit animals housed in single cages.&lt;ref name="Lutz_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lutz CK, Novak MA | title = Environmental enrichment for nonhuman primates: theory and application | journal = ILAR Journal | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 178–91 | date = 2005 | pmid = 15775027 | doi = 10.1093/ilar.46.2.178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mirrors are also a potential form of enrichment, specifically for animals that display an understanding of self-recognition, such as non-human primates. In addition to using mirrors to reflect the animal's own image, mirrors can also be angled so the animal is able to see normally out-of-sight areas of the holding area.&lt;ref name="Lutz_2005" /&gt;

Enclosures in modern zoos are often designed to facilitate environmental enrichment. For example, the [[Denver Zoo]]'s exhibit Predator Ridge allows different African [[carnivora|carnivores]] to be rotated among several enclosures, providing the animals with a differently sized environment.

=== Auditory enrichment ===
In the wild, animals are exposed to a variety of sounds that they normally do not encounter in captivity. Auditory enrichment can be used to mimic the animal's natural habitat. Types of nature-based auditory enrichment include rainforest sounds and conspecific vocalizations.&lt;ref name="Lutz_2005" /&gt;

The most common form of auditory enrichment is music, whose principal stems primarily from its benefit to humans. The benefits of [[classical music]] have been widely studied in animals, from sows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silva|first1=Flávia R.

== Active enrichment ==
[[File:Behavioral enrichment - Feeding.JPG|thumb|alt=Behavioral enrichment – Feeding|Active enrichment during feeding session]]Active enrichment often requires the animal to perform some sort of physical activity as well as direct interaction with the enrichment object. Active enrichment items can temporarily reduce stereotypic behaviors as their beneficial effects are usually limited to the short periods of active use.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;[[File:Behavioral enrichment - Sensory.JPG|thumb|alt=Behavioral enrichment – Sensory|Inanimate tactile enrichment with paper bag]]

=== Inanimate tactile enrichment ===
Inanimate tactile enrichment encourages the animal to explore and manipulate various kinds of inanimate objects, behaviors that the animal would naturally display in the wild. Most inanimate tactile enrichment occurs in the context of searching for food, such as cracking open a nut or digging holes in tree trunks for worms. Other common manipulable tactile objects include rubber toys stuffed with treats. Instead of providing the food directly, foraging devices are useful in increasing the amount of searching and foraging of food, comparable to the amount of time they would spend in the wild.&lt;ref name="Lutz_2005" /&gt; Elaborate systems of food presentation have also been developed (e.g. presenting dead [[rat]]s for [[wildcat]]s in a Swedish zoo){{citation needed|date=April 2013}} and computer programmed devices which allow the animals in the enclosure to search for prey as they would in their natural environment.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Inanimate tactile enrichment can also be beneficial without the association with food. For example, stones have been shown to encourage exploratory behavior in [[Japanese macaque]]s. Interaction with the stones exhibited behaviors such as gathering, rolling in hands, rubbing, and carrying.&lt;ref name="Lutz_2005" /&gt;

Other common forms include cardboard, forage, and even the texture of the food (i.e. hard, smooth, cold, warm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arkanimals.com/ark/e_enrichment_101.html#TACTILE|title=Enrichment 101: Environment, Enrichment, &amp; Education|website=www.arkanimals.com|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Olfactory enrichment ===
Olfactory enrichment can stimulate naturalistic behavior, enhance exploration, and reduce inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-73945-8_37|title=Chemical Signals in Vertebrates 11|last=Clark|first=Fay|last2=King|first2=Andrew J. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2008|publisher=Springer, New York, NY|isbn=9780387739441|pages=391–398|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-73945-8_37}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of enrichment is most commonly used for wild felines, both large and small. Exposure to different odors has been shown to influence behavior, resulting in increased activity and exploration.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wells|first=Deborah L.|last2=Egli|first2=Justin M. | name-list-format = vanc |title=The influence of olfactory enrichment on the behaviour of captive black-footed cats, Felis nigripes|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2003.08.013|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=85|issue=1-2|pages=107–119|doi=10.1016/j.applanim.2003.08.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odors can be smeared or sprayed on an object such as a ball or a tree branch. Types of odors can include catnip, odor of conspecific, or perfume.

=== Cognitive enrichment ===
Lack of cognitive stimulation could cause boredom and frustration which are manifested in behavioral disturbances. Because most cognitive enrichment is reinforced with food, it activates reward-related circuits in the brain that can directly affect emotional processes of appraisal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meyer S, Puppe B, Langbein J | title = [Cognitive enrichment in zoo and farm animals--implications for animal behaviour and welfare] | journal = Berliner Und Munchener Tierarztliche Wochenschrift | volume = 123 | issue = 11-12 | pages = 446–56 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21141273 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Puzzle feeders are a common method of providing cognitive enrichment, as it makes food harder to access than during routine feeding. Some consider training to be a form of cognitive enrichment, since it requires animals to use their cognitive skills to respond to cues.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=Fay|title=Cognitive enrichment and welfare: Current approaches and future directions|url=http://www.animalbehaviorandcognition.org/article.php?id=907|journal=Animal Behavior and Cognition|volume=4|issue=1|pages=52–71|doi=10.12966/abc.05.02.2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computerized tasks are growing in popularity as it provides feedback as to whether an animal is cognitively enriched. These tasks are designed to test a specific cognitive skill and are standardized so that performance can be compared within and between subjects. It is important to ensure that the task provided is not too easy for the animal, nor too difficult that they get discouraged.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

=== Social enrichment ===
Social enrichment can either involve housing a group of conspecifics or animals of different species that would naturally encounter each other in the wild. Social animals in particular (i.e. most primates, lions, flamingos, etc.), benefit from social enrichment because it has the positive effect of creating confidence in the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.colchester-zoo.com/explore/environmental-enrichment|title=Environmental Enrichment - Colchester Zoo|last=User|first=Super|access-date=2018-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social enrichment can encourage social behaviors that are seen in the wild, including feeding, foraging, defense, territoriality, reproduction, and courtship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://littlerockzoo.com/socialenrichment|title=Social Enrichment|website=littlerockzoo.com|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human-interaction enrichment ===
The most common form of human-interaction enrichment is training. The human and animal interaction during training builds trust, and increases the animal's cooperation during clinical and research procedures. In addition, training sessions have been shown to benefit the welfare of both individually housed animals and communally housed animals by providing cognitive stimulation, increasing social play, decreasing inactivity, and mitigating social aggression during feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker KC | title = Benefits of Positive Human Interaction for Socially-Housed Chimpanzees | journal = Animal Welfare | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 239–245 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 20505791 | pmc = 2875797 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amount of enrichment==

A survey of over 200 staff working with mammals at 60 zoos in 13 countries found that all forms of enrichment were considered important for mammals, but several of them were rarely available, because of lack of staff or other priorities.&lt;ref name="hoy"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoy JM, Murray PJ, Tribe A | title = Thirty years later: enrichment practices for captive mammals | journal = Zoo Biology | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–16 | date = 2010 | pmid = 19434736 | doi = 10.1002/zoo.20254 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Julia_Hoy/publication/24420182_Thirty_Years_Later_Enrichment_Practices_for_Captive_Mammals/links/54e697870cf277664ff634f0.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessing the success==

A range of methods can be used to assess which environmental enrichments should be provided.  These are based on the premises that captive animals should perform behaviours in a similar way to those in the [[ethogram]] of their ancestral species,&lt;ref name="Dawkins, (1989)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dawkins MS | year = 1989 | title = Time budgets in red junglefowl as a baseline for the assessment of welfare in domestic-fowl. | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 24 | pages = 77–80 | doi = 10.1016/0168-1591(89)90126-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; animals should be allowed to perform the activities or interactions they prefer, i.e. [[Preference test|preference test studies]],&lt;ref name="Sherwin and Glenn, (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sherwin CM, Glen EF | year = 2003 | title = Cage colour preferences and effects of home-cage colour on anxiety in laboratory mice. | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 66 | pages = 1085–1092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and animals should be allowed to perform  those activities for which they are highly motivated, i.e. [[Consumer demand tests (animals)|motivation studies]].&lt;ref name="Sherwin, (2004)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sherwin CM | year = 2004 | title = The motivation of group-housed laboratory mice, Mus musculus, for additional space. | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 67 | pages = 711–717 | doi = 10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.08.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental enrichment is a way to ensure that an animals natural and instinctual behaviors are kept and able to be passed and taught from one generation to the next. Enrichment techniques that encourage species specific behaviors, like those that are discovered in the wild, have been studied and found to help the process of reintroduction of [[endangered species]] into their natural habitats, as well as helping to create offspring with natural traits and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-0721-1_8|title=The role of environmental enrichment in the captive breeding and reintroduction of endangered species| vauthors = Shepherdson O |date=1994-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401043113| veditors = Olney PJ, Mace GM, Feistner AT |pages=167–177|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-0721-1_8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main way the success of environmental enrichment can be measured is by recognizing the behavioral changes that occur from the techniques used to shape desired behaviors of the animal compared to the behaviors of those found in the wild.&lt;ref name=":4x"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=LmKCN-7kluYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA337&amp;dq=success+of+environmental+enrichment+in+zoos&amp;ots=g2M-isKBgc&amp;sig=J_jekMLB5R_7237kznz3o63IpH0#v=onepage&amp;q=success%252520of%252520environmental%252520enrichment%252520in%252520zoos&amp;f=false|title=The Biology of Animal Stress: Basic Principles and Implications for Animal Welfare|last=Moberg|first=Gary P.|last2=Mench|first2=Joy A. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2000-01-01|publisher=CABI|isbn=9780851999302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ways that the success of environmental enrichment can be assessed quantitatvely by a range of [[Animal welfare science|behavioral and physiological indicators of animal welfare]].  In addition to those listed above, behavioral indicators include the occurrence of [[List of abnormal behaviours in animals|abnormal behaviours]] (e.g. [[Stereotypy (non-human)|stereotypies]],&lt;ref name="Mason, (1991)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mason GJ | year = 1991 | title = Stereotypies - A critical review. | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 41 | pages = 1015–1037 | doi = 10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80640-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Claes et al., (2010)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Claes A, Attur Shanmugam A, Jensen P | year = 2010 | title = Habituation to environmental enrichment in captive Sloth Bears-effect on stereotypies | journal = Zoo Biology | volume = 29 | pages = 705–714 | doi = 10.1002/zoo.2030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cognitive bias]] studies,&lt;ref name="Mendl et al., (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mendl M, Burman OH, Parker RM, Paul ES | year = 2009 | title = Cognitive bias as an indicator of animal emotion and welfare: Emerging evidence and underlying mechanisms. | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 118 | pages = 161–181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the effects of [[frustration]].&lt;ref name="Duncan and Wood-Gush, (1971)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duncan IJ, Wood-Gush DG | year = 1971 | title = Frustration and aggression in the domestic fowl. | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 19 | pages = 500–504 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zimmerman et al., (2003)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimmerman PH, Lundberg A, Keeling LJ, Koene P | year = 2003 | title = The effect of an audience on the gakel-call and other frustration behaviours in the laying hen (Gallus gallus domesticus) | journal = Animal Welfare | volume = 12 | pages = 315–326 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physiological indicators include [[heart rate]],&lt;ref name="Kemppinen et al., (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kemppinen N, Hau J, Meller A, Mauranen K, Kohila T, Nevalainen T | year = 2010 | title = Impact of aspen furniture and restricted feeding on activity, blood pressure, heart rate and faecal corticosterone and immunoglobulin A excretion in rats (Rattus norvegicus) housed in individually ventilated cages | journal = Laboratory Animals | volume = 44 | pages = 104–112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[corticosteroids]],&lt;ref name="Laws et al., (2007)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Laws N, Ganswindt A, Heistermann M, Harris M, Harris S, Sherwin C | year = 2007 | title =  A case study: fecal corticosteroid and behavior as indicators of welfare during relocation of an asian elephant. | journal = Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science | volume = 10 | pages = 349–358 | doi = 10.1080/10888700701555600 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immune system|immune function]],&lt;ref name="Martin et al., (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin LB, Kidd L, Liebl AL, Coon CA | title = Captivity induces hyper-inflammation in the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 214 | issue = Pt 15 | pages = 2579–85 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21753052 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.057216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuroscience|neuorobiology]],&lt;ref name="Lewis et al., (2006)"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Lewis MH, Presti MF, Lewis JB, Turner CA | year = 2006 | chapter = The neurobiology of stereotypy I: Environmental complexity.  | title = Stereotypic Animal Behaviour: Fundamentals and Applications to Welfare | veditors = Mason G, Rushen J | journal = CABI | pages =  190–226 | doi = 10.1079/9780851990040.0190 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[eggshell]] quality&lt;ref name="Hughes et al., (1986)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes BO, Gilbert AB, Brown MF | year = 1986 | title = Categorisation and causes of abnormal egg shells: relationship with stress. | journal = British Poultry Science | volume = 27 | pages = 325–337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[thermography]].&lt;ref name="Wilcox et al., (2009)"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilcox CS, Patterson J, Cheng HW | year = 2009 | title = Use of thermography to screen for subclinical [[Bumblefoot (infection)|bumblefoot]] in poultry.  | journal = Poultry Science | volume = 88 | pages = 1176–1180 | doi = 10.3382/ps.2008-00446 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very difficult for zookeepers to measure the effectiveness of enrichment in terms of the stress due to the fact that animals that are found in zoos are oftentimes on display and presented with very abnormal conditions that can cause uneasiness and stress. Measuring enrichment in terms of [[reproduction]] is easier because of our ability to record offspring numbers and fertility. By making necessary environment changes and providing mental stimulation, animals in captivity have been seen to reproduce at a more similar rate to their wild ancestors in comparison to those provided with less behavioral and environmental enrichment.&lt;ref name=":4x" /&gt;

== Issues and concerns ==

=== Habituation ===
Although environmental enrichments can provide sensory and social stimulations, it can also have limited efficacy if not changed frequently. Animals can become habituated to environmental enrichments, showing positive behaviors at onset of exposure and progressively declining with time. Environmental enrichments are effective primarily because it offers novelty stimuli, making the animal's daily routines less predictable, as would be in the wild. Therefore, maintaining novelty is important for the efficacy of the enrichment. Frequently changing the type of environmental enrichment will help prevent habituation.&lt;ref name="Bowman A 2017"/&gt;

=== Training ===
Usage of more highly advanced enrichment devices, such as computerized devices, requires training. This can lead to issues as training often consists of food as a reward. While food encourages the animal to participate with the device, the animal could associate the device with food. As a result, the interaction with the enrichment would bring about behaviors that are associated with training instead of the desired playful and voluntary behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = French F, Mancini C, Sharp H | title = High tech cognitive and acoustic enrichment for captive elephants | journal = Journal of Neuroscience Methods | volume = 300 | pages = 173–183 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 28951175 | doi = 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2017.09.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Time and resources ===
The process of producing and providing environmental enrichment usually require a large allocation of time and resources. In a survey,&lt;ref name="hoy" /&gt; "time taken by animal care staff to complete other tasks" was the most significant factor influencing environmental enrichment provisions and scheduling. Therefore it is important to develop appropriate environmental enrichment programs that can be effectively carried out with the size of staff and time available.

'''Biomechanical engineering''' is a [[bioengineering]] subdiscipline, which applies principles of [[mechanical engineering]] to [[biological systems]] and stems from the scientific discipline of [[biomechanics]]. Topics of interest in the field include [[biomedical engineering]] and [[agricultural engineering]]. '''[[Biomechanics]], specifically,''' is the study of biological systems such as the human body, combined with the study of mechanics, or mechanical applications. Using the skills learned from biology, engineering and physics to research and develop for health care, such as organs that have been made from artificial materials, or new advances with prosthetic limbs. The creation of [[biomaterial]], which is a fake material that can be integrated into living tissue or can live in sync with biological material, is one of the biggest advances in medicine to this day. Those in this field might also hold the job of not only installing, but also adjusting, maintain, repairing, and providing technical help for all the biomaterial.

'''Brian Andrew Dunning''' (born 1965) is an American writer and producer who focuses on science and [[Skeptical movement|skepticism]].&lt;ref name=lat-2013-04-19&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/19/business/la-fi-mo-cookie-stuffing-ebay-20130419 | title=Laguna Niguel man pleads guilty in 'cookie stuffing' scam against EBay | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=April 19, 2013 | last=Vincent | first=Roger }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has hosted a weekly podcast, ''Skeptoid'', since 2006, and he is an author of a series of books on the subject of [[scientific skepticism]], some of which are based on the podcast. ''Skeptoid'' has been the recipient of several podcast awards such as the [[Parsec Award]]. Dunning has also created the ''Skeptoid.org'' spin-off video series, ''inFact'', and ''The Feeding Tube'' both available on YouTube.

Dunning has produced two educational films on the subject of critical thinking, ''Here be Dragons'' in 2008, and ''Principles of Curiosity'' in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/principles_of_curiosity_review|title=Principles of Curiosity Review - CSI|last=Gerbic|first=Susan|date=2017-07-26|website=www.csicop.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170726211121/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/principles_of_curiosity_review|archive-date=2017-07-26|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunning co-founded Buylink, a [[business-to-business]] service provider, in 1996, and served at the company until 2002. He later became [[eBay]]'s second biggest [[Affiliate marketing|affiliate marketer]]; he has since been convicted of [[wire fraud]] through a [[cookie stuffing]] scheme. In August 2014, he was sentenced to 15 months in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release for the company obtaining between $200,000 and $400,000 through wire fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laguna Niguel Man Receives 15-Month Prison Term for Defrauding eBay|url=https://www.fbi.gov/sanfrancisco/press-releases/2014/laguna-niguel-man-receives-15-month-prison-term-for-defrauding-ebay|website=fbi.gov/sanfrancisco|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skeptical activism===
Beginning in 2006, Dunning hosted and produced ''Skeptoid'', a weekly audio [[podcast]] dedicated "to furthering knowledge by blasting away the widespread pseudosciences that infect popular culture, and replacing them with way cooler reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://skeptoid.com/about.php
|title=Skeptoid: Critical Analysis Podcast
|publisher=skeptoid.com
|accessdate=December 13, 2011
|oclc=461308119
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the author of the book of the same title and a sequel.

Beginning in 2007, Dunning periodically released video episodes of his ''InFact'' series. Each episode is under four minutes long and covers issues similar to those explored in more depth in the ''Skeptoid'' podcast, but is intended to reach a wider audience due to its brevity and availability on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunning|first1=Brian|title=Welcome to inFactVideo.com|url=http://infactvideo.com/|website=InfactVideo.com|publisher=Skeptoid Media|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Dunning produced ''Here Be Dragons'', a free 40 minute video introduction to critical thinking intended for general audiences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1262906/
|title = Here Be Dragons
|year=2008
|oclc=270775142

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Dunning was awarded the [[Parsec Award]] for "Best Fact Behind the Fiction Podcast".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101120235425/http://parsecawards.com/2010winners 2010 Parsec Awards] (archived version).&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010 he received an award recognizing his contributions in the [[skeptical]] field from the [[Independent Investigations Group]] (IIG) during its 10th Anniversary Gala.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iigwest.com/iigawards/index.html IIG Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017 Dunning's second film, ''Principles of Curiosity'', was released. According to Dunning, this "presents a general introduction to the foundations of scientific skepticism and critical thinking... It is nonprofit, noncommercial, and licensed for free public and private screenings. It is provided with free educational materials for teachers, designed for high school through college. It is suitable for all audiences. Its 40-minute runtime should fit into most classes."&lt;ref name = POC&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunning|first1=Brian|title=Principles of Curiosity|url=http://principlesofcuriosity.com/| website=PrinciplesOfCuriosity.com|publisher=Skeptoid Media|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "POC on YTube"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brian|first1=Dunning|title=Principles of Curiosity|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKY6jJbyCo0&amp;t|website=Youtube.com|publisher=Skeptoid Media|accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a member of the [[National Association of Science Writers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Wire fraud case===
In August 2008, [[eBay]] filed suit against Dunning, accusing him of defrauding eBay and eBay affiliates in a [[cookie stuffing]] scheme for his company, Kessler's Flying Circus. In June 2010, based on the same allegations and following an investigation by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], a [[grand jury]] indicted Dunning on charges of [[wire fraud]].&lt;ref name=Ars&gt;{{Cite journal

From an agreement of the parties, the eBay civil suit was dismissed in May 2014 and Dunning was sentenced in August 2014 to fifteen months in prison  for the company receiving between $200,000 and $400,000 in fraudulent commissions from eBay.&lt;ref name="prolific"&gt;{{cite web|title=Case5:08-cv-04052-EJD Document246|url=https://www.prolific.com/files.cgi/DIsmissal%20of%20eBay%20v%20Brian%20Dunning?tab=get&amp;uuid=4PM79CBD4287SAVBLM46VDP851QT&amp;filename=DIsmissal%20of%20eBay%20v%20Brian%20Dunning|publisher=United States District Court|accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dunningmessage"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Message from Brian Dunning |url=http://www.briandunning.com/message.html |accessdate=August 9, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Rh4hUTvK?url=http://www.briandunning.com/message.html |archivedate=August 9, 2014 |publisher=Brian Dunning |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case5:10-cr-00494-EJD Document77|url=https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.229019.77.0.pdf|website=courtlistener.com|date=n.d.|publisher=Courtlistener.com|accessdate=Jan 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunning admitted that he received payments to which he was not entitled, commenting "I fully accept this determination, and fully accept and admit responsibility for every action I was involved in."&lt;ref name=Dunning&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunning|first1=Brian|title=A message from Brian|url=http://www.briandunning.com/message.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Skeptoid'' podcast==
{{See also|List of skeptical podcasts}}
''Skeptoid'' is Dunning's weekly [[podcast]]. The show follows an audio essay format, and is dedicated to the critical examination of [[pseudoscience]] and the [[paranormal]]. In May 2012, ''Skeptoid'' became a California state non-profit corporation.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Skeptoid |url=http://skeptoid.com/about.php |publisher=Skeptoid.com | accessdate=May 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with similarly themed ''[[Point of Inquiry]]'', ''[[Skepticality|Skepticality: The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine]]'', and ''[[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]]'', it is listed on an [[iTunes]] (US) web page of popular science and medicine podcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewGenre?id=1315 | title=Podcasts: Science &amp; Medicine | work=iTunes Preview | publisher=Apple Inc. | accessdate=May 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, ''Skeptoid''’s website reported that the podcast had a weekly average of 161,000 downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Skeptoid |url=http://skeptoid.com/about.php |publisher=Skeptoid.com |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PlNknW9r?url=http://skeptoid.com/about.php |archivedate=22 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each roughly ten-minute ''Skeptoid'' episode focuses on a single issue that is generally [[pseudoscientific]] in nature. Transcriptions of the episodes are available on line,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dunning|first1=Brian|title=Skeptoid Episode Guide|url=https://skeptoid.com/episode_guide.php|website=Skeptoid.com|publisher=Skeptoid Media|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and usually fall into one of four categories:
* [[Quackery]] medical modalities: such as [[homeopathy]], [[reflexology]], [[Detoxification (alternative medicine)|detoxification]], or [[chiropractic]]
* Popular cultural misconceptions: such as [[organic foods]], [[SUV]]s, and [[global warming]]
* [[Urban legends]]: such as [[crop circles]], the [[The Amityville Horror|Amityville Horror]], the [[Phoenix Lights]], or the [[Philadelphia Experiment]]
* Religion and mythology: such as [[creation legends]], [[New Age]] religions, and concepts of [[sin]]

Beginning in 2007, Dunning authored a series of books based upon the ''Skeptoid'' podcast episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Get the Skeptoid Books|url=https://skeptoid.com/book.php|website=Skeptoid.com|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skeptoid : critical analysis of pop phenomena|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/skeptoid-critical-analysis-of-pop-phenomena/oclc/287154998|website=[[Worldcat.org]]|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skeptoid 2 : more critical analysis of pop phenomena|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/skeptoid-2-more-critical-analysis-of-pop-phenomena/oclc/589083050&amp;referer=brief_results|website=Worldcat.org|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skeptoid 3: Pirates, Pyramids, and Papyrus|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10522292-skeptoid-3|website=Goodreads.com|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skeptoid 4: Astronauts, Aliens, and Ape-Men|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15708940-skeptoid-4?ac=1&amp;from_search=true|website=[[Goodreads.com]]|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skeptoid 5: Massacres, Monsters, and Miracles|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19100835-skeptoid-5?ac=1&amp;from_search=true|website=Goodreads.com|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his shift away from the technology industry, Dunning continues to do computer programming, and does web development for his Skeptoid website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Reflecting on 5 Years of Skeptoid | url=http://skeptoid.com/blog/2011/10/03/5-years-of-skeptoid/ | publisher=Skeptoid.com | last=Dunning | first=Brian | date=October 3, 2011 | accessdate=May 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was formed in 1968 in opposition to university research on chemical and biological weapons, and supported by 83 distinguished scientists, including [[William Lawrence Bragg|William Bragg]], [[Francis Crick]], [[Julian Huxley]] and [[Bertrand Russell]]. Nobel laureate [[Maurice Wilkins]] was the founding President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=British Society for Social Responsibility in Science |url=https://www.artscatalyst.org/artist/british-society-social-responsibility-science |website=Arts Catalyst |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The main aims of the BSSRS was to raise awareness of the social responsibilities of scientists, the political aspect of science and technology, and to create an informed public.
 
==Details==
Among groups that were particularly active in BSSRS were members of
* Scientists against the Bomb
* The [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND)
*[[Radical Statistics]]
*the [[Open University]]
* the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE)

BSSRS's inaugural meeting, sponsored by 64 Fellows, was held at the [[Royal Society]], and attended by more
than 300, mostly UK, scientists and engineers. Professor [[Maurice Wilkins]]
was the founding President (1969–91).&lt;ref&gt;[[New Scientist]] 9 August 1975, pp 329&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the groups first targets was the [[British Science Association]]. At a meeting of the BSA in Durham in 1970, they raised political issues under a banner of "Science is not neutral". They continued their stance against the BSA, claiming it served a "propagandist function".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Beneath the white coat: the radical science movement |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/jul/18/beneath-white-coat-radical-science-movement |website=Guardian Newspaper |accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BSSRS published a newssheet (1969–72), continued by Science for People, (1972/3), and also had local societies and organized public meetings, as well as publishing longer research monographs.

A '''bumper fracture''' is a [[Bone fracture|fracture]] of the [[Human anatomical terms#Anatomical directions|lateral]] [[tibia]]l plateau caused by the bumper of a car coming into contact with the outer side of the knee when a person is standing.
Specifically, it is caused by a forced [[Valgus deformity|valgus]] applied to the [[knee]]. This causes the lateral part of the distal [[femur]] and the lateral tibial plateau to come into contact, compressing the tibial plateau and causing the tibia to fracture. The name of the injury is because it was described as being caused by the impact of a [[Bumper (automobile)|car bumper]] on the lateral side of the knee while the foot is planted on the ground, although this mechanism is only seen in about 25% of tibial plateau fractures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/396920-overview ''Tibial Plateau Fractures''] at [[eMedicine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fracture of the neck of the [[fibula]] may also be found, and associated injury to the [[medial collateral ligament]] or [[cruciate ligament]]s occurs in about 10% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=APLEY AG |title=Fractures of the lateral tibial condyle treated by skeletal traction and early mobilisation; a review of sixty cases with special reference to the long-term results |journal=J Bone Joint Surg Br |volume=38-B |issue=3 |pages=699–708 |date=August 1956 |pmid=13357593 |doi= |url=http://www.jbjs.org.uk/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=13357593 |accessdate=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Skeletal Trauma |url=https://www.med-ed.virginia.edu/courses/rad/ext/7knee/27.html |website=www.med-ed.virginia.edu |accessdate=13 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''California Commission for Economic Development'''&lt;ref&gt;http://ced.ca.gov&lt;/ref&gt; (CED) was established by statute in 1971 to serve as a bipartisan advisory board on economic development issues to the executive and legislative leadership of the State of [[California]]. The CED is composed of six members of the State legislature and ten members of the public appointed by the current [[Governor of California|Governor]] and represent several industries within California. 

== History ==
The Commission served the state under the statutory Chairmanship of Lieutenant Governors from 1971 through 1994, but in the seven years that followed, funding for the Commission was not included in the annual state budgets. Recognizing the need for additional economic development efforts, Governor [[Gray Davis]] and the Legislature restored funding for the Commission in 2002. In mid-2003, the Governor appointed a sufficient number of members to establish a quorum. Under a previous Chair, Lt. Governor Cruz Bustamante, the Commission held its first official meeting in more than ten years on December 15, 2003. The most recent Chair, prior to Gavin Newsom, was Lieutenant Governor [[John Garamendi]]. Under Garamendi, quarterly meetings took place in July and November 2007 and February and May 2008. He ended his term as Lieutenant Governor of California when he was elected into office in 2009. The current Lieutenant Governor, [[Gavin Newsom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ltg.ca.gov|title=Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom - Home|last=California|first=State of|website=www.ltg.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, provided an agenda for economic growth and competitiveness for California in 2011. This agenda was the first statewide economic plan in over ten years. By 2016, over 75-percent of the recommendations presented in the plan had been at least partially implemented. 

== Duties ==
Pursuant to California Code §14999-14999.10&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&amp;division=3.&amp;title=2.&amp;part=5.7.&amp;chapter=2.&amp;article=|title=Codes Display Text|website=leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Commission has the following powers and authority to carry out its statutory duties:

·  Evaluating specific economic development problems and providing recommendations for possible solutions.

·  Maintaining communication about economic dilemmas between the state government and the private sector.

·  Make recommendations to legislation regarding ongoing economic development projects and programs .

·  Evaluate development programs to ensure cost efficiency.

·  Preparing specialized reports, which can include key secondary outcomes on economic development of programs and/or regulations, to support and guide the Governor or Legislature.

== Objectives ==
The Commission for Economic Development assesses issues relating to developing the economy and workforce, trade and government efficiency. Its many goals include increasing effectiveness of the government and its partners in developing and augmenting the workforce of California. While maintaining the workforce, the commission seeks to assemble a strong connection between workforce development and a growing economy, all while encouraging education. The large-scale goal of the CED is to unite all major aspects of an economy (development, small businesses, trade, regulations, etc.) to transform California into a productive and continuously growing entity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2824">{{distinguish|text=the [[Born Rule]] in [[quantum mechanics]]}}

The '''Cauchy–Born rule''' or '''Cauchy-Born approximation''' is a basic hypothesis used in the mathematical formulation of [[solid mechanics]] which relates the movement of atoms in a crystal to the overall deformation of the bulk solid. It states that in a crystalline solid subject to a small [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]], the positions of the atoms within the crystal lattice follow the overall strain of the medium. The currently accepted form is [[Max Born|Max Born's]] refinement of [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy's]] original hypothesis which was used to derive the equations satisfied by the [[Cauchy stress tensor]]. The approximation generally holds for face-centered and body-centered [[cubic crystal system]]s. For complex lattices such as [[diamond]], however, the rule has to be modified to allow for internal degrees of freedom between the sublattices. The approximation can then be used to obtain bulk properties of crystalline materials such as stress-strain relationship.

For crystalline bodies of finite size, the effect of surface stress is also significant. However, the standard Cauchy–Born rule cannot deduce the surface properties. To overcome this limitation, Park et al. (2006) proposed a surface Cauchy–Born rule. Several modified forms of the Cauchy–Born rule have also been proposed to cater to crystalline bodies having special shapes. Arroyo &amp; Belytschko (2002) proposed an exponential Cauchy Born rule for modeling of mono-layered crystalline sheets as two-dimensional continuum shells. Kumar et al. (2015) proposed a helical Cauchy–Born rule for modeling slender bodies (such as nano and continuum rods) as special Cosserat continuum rods.

'''''Death from the Skies!: These Are The Ways The World Will End''''' is a book by the American astronomer [[Phil Plait]], also known as "the Bad Astronomer". The book was published in 2008 and explores the various ways in which the human race could be rendered [[Human extinction|extinct]] by astronomical phenomena.

==Background==
The author stated during an interview that one of the reasons for writing the book was that "the Universe is incredibly inhospitable, yet we have this planet that’s doing OK by us. Another is that the Universe is incredibly cool and interesting. [[Black holes]] are really fun to think about. Actually, most of this is mind-stretching and fun. What happens to the Sun after 100 quadrillion years? One hundred [[octillion]]? A [[googol]]?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brotherton|first1=Mike| authorlink =Mike Brotherton|title=Interview with the Bad Astronomer, Phil Plait, about Death from the Skies|url=http://www.mikebrotherton.com/2008/11/03/interview-with-the-bad-astronomer-phil-plait-about-death-from-the-skies/|website=www.mikebrotherton.com/|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that the reason for using [[doomsday scenarios]] was to take a scientific viewpoint, make it like a roller coaster or horror movie to make it fun and exciting. The stories were not to scare people out of their pants but make it cool to read about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |host=Steve Novella|title=Podcast #170 |website=[[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]] |date=22 October 2008 |url=http://www.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/170 |accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4300">In [[game theory]], '''differential games''' are a group of problems related to the modeling and analysis of conflict in the context of a [[dynamical system]].  More specifically, a [[state variable]] or variables evolve over time according to a [[differential equation]].  Early analyses reflected military interests, considering two actors - the pursuer and the evader - with diametrically opposed goals.  More recent analyses have reflected engineering or economic considerations.

==Connection to optimal control==

Differential games are related closely with [[optimal control]] problems. In an optimal control problem there is single control &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; and a single criterion to be optimized; differential game theory generalizes this to two controls &lt;math&gt;u(t),v(t)&lt;/math&gt; and two criteria, one for each player.  Each player attempts to control the state of the system so as to achieve its goal; the system responds to the inputs of all players.

==History==

The first to study differential games was [[Rufus Isaacs (game theorist)|Rufus Isaacs]] (1951, published 1965)&lt;ref&gt;Rufus Isaacs, ''Differential Games'', Dover, 1999. {{ISBN|0-486-40682-2}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=XIxmMyIQgm0C Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the first games analyzed was the [[Homicidal chauffeur problem|'homicidal chauffeur game']].

==Random time horizon==
Games with a random time horizon are a particular case of differential games.&lt;ref name="PM66"&gt;Petrosjan, L.A. and Murzov, N.V. (1966). ''Game-theoretic problems of mechanics''. Litovsk. Mat. Sb. 6, pp. 423–433 (in Russian).&lt;/ref&gt; In such games, the terminal time is a random variable with a given [[probability distribution]] function. Therefore, the players maximize the [[mathematical expectancy]] of the cost function. It was shown that the modified optimization problem can be reformulated as a discounted differential game over an infinite time interval&lt;ref&gt;Petrosjan L.A. and Shevkoplyas E.V. Cooperative games with random duration, Vestnik of St.Petersburg Univ., ser.1, Vol.4, 2000  (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HS11"&gt;Marín-Solano, Jesús and Shevkoplyas, Ekaterina V. ''Non-constant discounting and differential games with random time horizon''. Automatica, Vol. 47(12), December 2011, pp. 2626–2638.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Differential games have been applied to economics. Recent developments include adding [[stochasticity]] to differential games and the derivation of the [[stochastic feedback Nash equilibrium]] (SFNE). A recent example is the stochastic differential game of capitalism by Leong and Huang (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Leong | first1 = C.

The '''flyby anomaly''' is a discrepancy between current scientific models and the actual increase in speed (i.e. increase in ''[[kinetic energy]]'') observed during a planetary [[gravity assist|flyby]] by a spacecraft. In multiple cases, spacecraft have been observed to gain greater speed than scientists have predicted and as yet no convincing explanation has been found. This anomaly has been observed as shifts in the [[s band|S-band]] and [[x band|X-band]] [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] and ranging [[telemetry]].  Taken together, it causes a significant unaccounted velocity increase of up to 13&amp;nbsp;mm/s during flybys.&lt;ref name="Rosetta"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=29609 |title=ESA's Rosetta spacecraft may help unravel cosmic mystery |date=November 12, 2009 |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations==
[[gravitational slingshot|Gravitational assists]] are valuable techniques for [[Timeline of Solar System exploration|Solar System exploration]]. Because the success of these flyby maneuvers depends on the geometry of the [[trajectory]], the position and velocity of a spacecraft is continually tracked during its encounter with a planet by the [[Deep Space Network]] (DSN).

The flyby anomaly was first noticed during a careful inspection of DSN Doppler data shortly after the Earth flyby of the [[Galileo spacecraft]] on 8 December 1990. While the Doppler residuals (observed minus computed data) were expected to remain flat, the analysis revealed an unexpected 66&amp;nbsp;[[millihertz|mHz]] shift, which corresponds to a velocity increase of 3.92&amp;nbsp;mm/s at [[Apsis|perigee]]. Investigations of this effect at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) and the [[University of Texas]] have not yielded a satisfactory explanation. No anomaly was detected after the second Earth flyby of the [[Galileo spacecraft]] in December 1992, where the measured velocity decrease matched that expected from atmospheric drag at the lower altitude of 303&amp;nbsp;km.  However, the drag estimates had large error bars, and so an anomalous acceleration could not be ruled out.&lt;ref name="GAL2"&gt;{{cite web |title=TRACKING GALILEO AT EARTH-2 PERIGEE USING THE TRACKING AND DATA RELAY SATELLITE SYSTEM |author=C, Edwards, J. Anderson, P, Beyer, S. Bhaskaran, J. Borders, S. DiNardo, W. Folkner, R. Haw, S. Nandi, F. Nicholson, C. 0ttenhoff, S. Stephens |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.38.4256&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |date=1993}}.  The two [measurement] methods yielded similar fits to the data. Within an uncertainty of eight percent, both methods yielded a decrease in velocity along track of −5.9±0.2 mm/s. A priori predictions for the drag-induced velocity change, based on the Jacchia–Roberts model, were −6.2±4.O mm/s [5], clearly consistent with the observed velocity change. In contrast, DSN data from the December 1990 Earth flyby, at altitude 956 km, indicated an unexplained increase in along-track velocity of 4 mm/s, after accounting for the much smaller drag effects.  Given the uncertainty in drag models, we cannot conclusively rule out the possibility that a similar increase occurred at Earth 2. For example, an unmodeled increase of 4 mm/s and a drag decrease of −10 mm/s would be compatible with our results and our a priori atmospheric model. Significantly larger anomalous velocity increases, however, would appear inconsistent with the drag model.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 1998 the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous ([[NEAR]]) spacecraft experienced an anomalous velocity increase of 13.46&amp;nbsp;mm/s after its Earth encounter. [[Cassini–Huygens]] gained around 0.11&amp;nbsp;mm/s in August 1999, and [[Rosetta space probe|Rosetta]] gained 1.82&amp;nbsp;mm/s after its Earth flyby in March 2005.

An analysis of the [[MESSENGER]] spacecraft (studying [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]) did not reveal any significant unexpected velocity increase. This may be because MESSENGER both approached and departed Earth symmetrically about the equator (see data and proposed equation below).  This suggests that the anomaly may be related to Earth's rotation.

In November 2009, ESA's [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta spacecraft]] was tracked closely during flyby in order to precisely measure its velocity, in an effort to gather further data about the anomaly, but no significant anomaly was found.&lt;ref name="ESA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nav.ei.tum.de/fileadmin/w00bkq/layout/colloquium_biele_slides.pdf |title=Navigation of the interplanetary Rosetta and Philae spacecraft and the determination of the gravitational field of comets and asteroids - (DLR) @ TU München, 2012 |author=J.

&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 flyby of Juno on the way to Jupiter yielded no anomalous acceleration.&lt;ref name="JUNO"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Thompson, Paul F. |author2=Matthew Abrahamson |author3=Shadan Ardalan |author4=John Bordi |title=Reconstruction of Earth flyby by the Juno spacecraft. |publisher=AAS, |conference=24th AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics Meeting |location=Santa Fe, NM |date=2014 |pages=14–435 |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20160008163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a careful analysis of the trajectory of the presumed interstellar asteroid [[ʻOumuamua]] revealed a small excess velocity as it receded from the Sun. Initial speculation suggested that the anomaly was due to outgassing, though none had been detected.

==Future research==
Upcoming missions with Earth flybys include [[BepiColombo]] with its launch due in October 2018 and its Earth flyby due April 2020.

Some missions designed to study gravity, such as [[STEP (satellite)|STEP]], will make extremely accurate gravity measurement and may shed some light on the anomaly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Probing the Flyby Anomaly with the future STE-QUEST mission |journal=Planetary and Space Science |volume=79-80 |pages=76–81 |arxiv=1210.7333 |doi=10.1016/j.pss.2013.02.005 |year=2013 |last1=Páramos |first1=Jorge |last2=Hechenblaikner |first2=G. |bibcode=2013P&amp;SS...79...76P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proposed equation===
An empirical equation for the anomalous flyby velocity change was proposed by J. D. Anderson et al.:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dV}{V} = \frac{2 \omega_\text{E} R_\text{E} (\cos \varphi_\text{i} - \cos \varphi_\text{o})}{c}, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] of the Earth, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; is the Earth radius, and ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; are the inbound and outbound equatorial angles of the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Anderson |title=Anomalous Orbital-Energy Changes Observed during Spacecraft Flybys of Earth |journal=Phys.

==Possible explanations==
There have been a number of proposed explanations of the flyby anomaly, including:
*Unaccounted [[transverse Doppler effect]]—i.e. the redshift of light source with zero radial and non-zero tangential velocity.&lt;ref name="mbelek"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Mbelek |first=J. P. |eprint=0809.1888 |title=Special relativity may account for the spacecraft flyby anomalies |class=qr-qc |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this cannot explain the similar anomaly in the ranging data.
*A [[dark-matter]] halo around Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=S.L.Adler |title=Can the flyby anomaly be attributed to Earth-bound dark matter? |date=2008 |arxiv=0805.2895 |bibcode=2009PhRvD..79b3505A |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.79.023505 |journal=Physical Review D |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=023505}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A modification of inertia resulting from a Hubble-scale [[Casimir effect]], related to the [[Unruh effect]] ([[MiHsC]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=M. E.

*The impact of [[general relativity]], in its weak-field and linearized form yielding [[gravitoelectric]] and [[gravitomagnetic]] phenomena like [[frame-dragging]], has been investigated as well:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=L. Iorio |title=The Effect of General Relativity on Hyperbolic Orbits and Its Application to the Flyby Anomaly |journal=Scholarly Research Exchange |volume=2009 |doi=10.3814/2009/807695 |id=807695 |date=2009 |pages=1–8 |bibcode=2009ScReE2009.7695I |arxiv=0811.3924}}&lt;/ref&gt; it turns out to be unable to account for the flyby anomaly.

*The analysis of the Juno flyby looked at analysis errors that could potentially mimic the flyby anomaly.  They found that a high precision gravity field (at least 50x50 degree/order) was needed for accurate flyby predictions.  Use of a lower precision gravity field (10x10 degree/order, sufficient for launch analysis), would yield a 4.5 mm/sec velocity error.&lt;ref name="JUNO"/&gt;

[[File:Four-sides-model en.svg|thumb|upright=2|&lt;center&gt;Graphic of the four-sides model&lt;/center&gt;]]
The '''four-sides model''' (also known as '''communication square''' or '''four-ears model''') is a [[communication model]] by [[Friedemann Schulz von Thun]]. According to this model every message has four facets&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schulz-von-thun.de/index.php?article_id=71 4-sides model as per website of the (commercially operating) Schulz von Thun Institute for Communication (content in German)]&lt;/ref&gt; though not the same emphasis might be put on each. The four sides of the message are fact, self-revealing, relationship, and appeal.

== Relationship ==
The communication square describes the multi-layered structure of human utterances. It combines the idea of a postulate (second axiom) from [[Paul Watzlawick]], that every message contains content and relational facets, with the three sides of the [[Organon model]] by [[Karl Bühler]], that every message might reveal something about the sender, the receiver, and the request at hand. Such models are familiar in the linguistic community as part of [[speech act]] theory.

== The four sides of communication ==
* The ''Factual Level'' contains statements which are matter of fact like data and facts, which are part of the news.
* In the ''[[I-message|self-revealing]]'' or [[self-disclosure]] the speaker - conscious or not intended - tells something about himself, his motives, values, emotions etc.
* In the ''[[Social relationship|Relationship]]-layer'' is expressed resp. received {{Clarify|date=October 2018}}, how the sender gets along with the receiver and what she thinks of her.
* The ''[[Appeal (communication)|Appeal]]'' contains the desire, advice, instruction and effects that the speaker is seeking.

Every layer can be misunderstood individually.
The classic example of Schulz von Thun is the front-seat passenger who tells the driver: "Hey, the traffic lights are green". The driver will understand something different, depending on the ear with which he will hear, and will react differently. (On the matter layer he will understand the '''"fact"''' "''the traffic lights are green''", he could also understand it as "''Come on, drive''! ."-'''"command"''', or on the '''"relationship"''' could hear a help like "''I want to help you'', or if he hears behind it: ''I am in a hurry'' the passenger reveals part of himself "'''self-revelatory'''".") The emphasis on the four layers can be meant differently and also be understood differently. So the sender can stress the appeal of the statement and the receiver can mainly receive the relationship part of the message. This is one of the main reasons for misunderstandings.

=== The Factual Level ===
What I inform about:

On the '''factual level''' the sender of the news gives data, facts and statements. It is the task of the sender to send this information clearly and understandably.

The receiver proves with the  '''Factual ear''', whether the matter message fulfills the criteria of truth (true/untrue) or relevance (relevant/irrelevant) and the completeness (satisfying/something has to be added).

In a long-term team, the matter layer is clear and needs only a few words.

=== The self-revealing ===
What I reveal about myself:

In every news there is information about the sender.
On the layer of the '''self-revealing''' or [[self-disclosure]] the sender reveals himself. This message consists of conscious intended self-expression as well as unintended self-revealing, which is not conscious to the sender (see also [[Johari window]]). Thus, every news becomes information about the personality of the sender.

The '''self-revealing ear''' of the receiver perceives which information about the sender is hidden in the message.

=== The relationship indicator ===
What I think about you (you-statement) and how we get along (we-statement):

The '''relationship layer''' expresses how the sender gets along with the receiver and what he thinks about him. Depending on how he talks to him (way of formulation, body language, intonation ...) he expresses esteem, respect, friendliness, disinterest, contempt or something else.

Depending on which message the receiver hears with '''relationship ear''', he feels either depressed, accepted or patronized. A good communication is distinguished by communication from mutual appreciation.

=== The appeal ===
What I want to make you do:

Who states something, will also affect something. This '''appeal-message''' should make the receiver do something or leave something undone.  The attempt to influence someone can be less or more open (advice) or hidden (manipulation).

On the  '''Appeal ear''' the receiver asks himself: "What should I do, think or feel now?"

citation: " Mothers are very appeal-influenced by children."
Mum! The shoes .... Yes! I'll be right there to put them on for you.

== Example ==
Two people are eating a home-cooked meal together.

The one who didn't cook says: "There is something green in the soup."
; Sender
:{|
| Factual Level: || ''There is something green.''
|-
| Self-revealing layer: || ''I don't know what it is.''
|-
| Relationship layer: || ''You should know what it is.''
|-
| Appeal layer: || ''Tell me what it is!''
|}

; Receiver
:{|
| Matter layer: || ''There is something green.''
|-
| Self-revealing layer: || ''You do not know what the green item is, and that makes you feel uncomfortable.''
|-
| Relationship layer: || ''You think my cooking is questionable.''
|-
| Appeal layer: || ''I should only cook what you know in the future!''
|}

The other answers: "If you don't like the taste, you can cook it yourself."

'''Franklin's electrostatic machine''' is a high-voltage [[static electricity]]-[[Electrostatic generator|generating device]] used by [[Benjamin Franklin]] in the mid-18th century for research into electrical phenomena. Its key components are a [[glass]] globe which turned on an axis via a [[crank (mechanism)|crank]], a [[cloth]] pad in contact with the spinning globe, a set of [[metal]] needles to conduct away the [[electric charge|charge]] developed on the globe by its [[friction]] with the pad, and a [[Leyden jar]]{{snd}}a high-voltage [[capacitor]]{{snd}}to accumulate the charge. Franklin's experiments with the machine eventually led to new theories about [[electricity]] and inventing the [[lightning rod]].

== Background ==
{{Main article|Benjamin Franklin#Inventions and scientific inquiries}}
[[File:Franklin's Leyden jar experiment.png|thumb|left|upright 0.7|Leyden jar experiment]]

Franklin was not the first to build an electrostatic generator. European scientists developed machines to generate static electricity decades earlier. In 1663, [[Otto von Guericke]] generated static electricity with a device that used a sphere of sulfur.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=61}} [[Francis Hauksbee]] developed a more advanced electrostatic generator around 1704 using a glass bulb that had a vacuum. He later replaced the globe with a glass tube of about {{convert|2.5|feet}} emptied of air.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=61}} The glass tube was a less effective static generator than the globe, but it became more popular because it was easier to use.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=62}}

Machines that generated static electricity with a glass disc were popular and widespread in Europe by 1740.{{sfn|Grimnes|2014|page=495}} In 1745, German cleric [[Ewald Georg von Kleist]] and Dutch scientist [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] discovered independently that the electric charge from these machines could be stored in a [[Leyden jar]], named after the city of [[Leiden]] in the [[Netherlands]].{{sfn|Grimnes|2014|page=495}}

In 1745, [[Peter Collinson (botanist)|Peter Collinson]], a businessman from London who corresponded with American and European scientists, donated a German "glass tube"{{sfn|Talbott|2005|p=185}} along with instructions how to make static electricity, to Franklin's [[Library Company of Philadelphia]].{{sfn|Cohen|1990|p=61}} Collinson was the library's London agent and provided the latest technology news from Europe.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|pp=58–59}}{{sfn|Crane|1954|p=48}}{{sfn|Pasles|2008|p=119}} Franklin wrote a letter to Collinson on March 28, 1747,{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=67}} thanking him, and saying the tube and instructions had motivated  several colleagues and him to begin serious experiments with electricity.&lt;ref name=Letter&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=From Benjamin Franklin to Peter Collinson, 28 March 1747 |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-03-02-0055 |publisher=[[National Historical Publications and Records Commission]] |access-date= July 15, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028190523/http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-03-02-0055 |archivedate=28 October 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Benjamin Franklin's static electricity tube (Collinson tube), maker unknown, London, c. 1747 - DSC06567.JPG|thumb|upright 0.9|Collinson gift of "glass tube" used for producing static electricity]]
In 1746, Franklin began working on electrical experiments with [[Ebenezer Kinnersley]] after he bought all of [[Archibald Spencer]]'s electrical equipment that he used in his lectures. Later, he was also associated with [[Thomas Hopkinson]] and [[Philip Syng]] in experimentation with electricity.{{sfn|Maclean|1877|page=142}}{{sfn|Talbott|2005|p=182}} In the summer of 1747 they had received an electrical system from [[Thomas Penn]].{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=75}} While no records exists to tell exactly what parts were included in the system, historian J. A. Leo LeMay believes it was a combination of an electricity generating machine, a Leyden jar, a glass tube, and a stool that was electrically insulated from the ground.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|page=75}}{{sfn|Garche|2013|p=596}} This gave Franklin a complete system to experiment with generating and storing electricity.{{sfn|Crane|1954|p=48}}

When [[amber]], [[sulfur]], or [[glass]] are rubbed with certain materials, they produce electrical effects.{{sfn|Cohen|1990|p=28}} Franklin theorized this "electrical fire" was collected from this other material somehow, and not produced by the friction on the object.{{sfn|Talbott|2005|p=184}}{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=71}} He decided to retire early from his printing business, still in his early forties, to spend more time studying electricity. In 1748, Franklin turned over his entire printing business to his partner [[David Hall (publisher)|David Hall]].{{sfn|Waldstreicher|2005|pp=126–127}} He moved into a new Philadelphia home with his wife, where he built a laboratory to conduct experiments and research new electrical theories.{{sfn|Finger|2012|p=85}}&lt;ref name=HomeLab&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Franklin's Lightning Rod |url=https://www.fi.edu/history-resources/franklins-lightning-rod |publisher=[[The Franklin Institute]] |access-date=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin experimented not only with the electrostatic machine with the glass globe, but also with the Leyden jar.{{sfn|Tucker|2005|p=40}} He kept a detailed journal of his research in a diary called "Electrical Minutes" that has since been lost.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|page=91}} Franklin's machine was given to [[Library Company of Philadelphia]] by Franklin's grandson in 1792,{{sfn|Talbott|2005|p=185}} and is currently on display at the [[Franklin Institute]].

==Description==

Franklin's machine used a [[mechanical advantage#chain and belt drives|belt and pulley system]] that could be operated by one person turning a crank.{{sfn|Tucker|2005|p=40}} A large pulley was attached to the crank handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe to be rotated at high speed.{{sfn|Secor|1975|p=214}} When the crank was turned, the glass globe rubbed against a leather pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=72}} A few revolutions of the handle were all that were needed to charge a Leyden jar.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=72}}{{sfn|Cohen|1956|page=440}}

The electricity produced by the machine, in the form of sparks, passed through a set of metal needles positioned close to the spinning globe. The electric charge continued passing through a beaded iron chain, which acted as a conductor, to a Leyden jar that received the electricity.{{sfn|McNichol|2011|pages=10–16}}&lt;ref name=JrankChain&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Electrostatic Devices |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/2393/Electrostatic-Devices.html |page=2393 |website=Science Encyclopedia |publisher=Net Industries |access-date=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gregory|1822|p=8}}{{sfn|McGrath|2001|p=1335}} Franklin called the sparks produced by the machine "electrical fire".{{sfn|Crane|1954|p=48}}

Franklin had help building his machine. The basic mechanical design was developed by [[Philip Syng]].{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=72}} The wood frame was probably made by Franklin's friend [[Benjamin Loxley]], a Philadelphia carpenter who made similar machines for [[Lewis Evans (surveyor)|Lewis Evans]] in 1751.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=75}} The glass globes, known as "electerizing globes",{{sfn|Bridenbaugh|2012|p=63}} were made of glass that was scientifically designed to produce static electricity effectively.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |title=The Wistars and their Glass 1739 – 1777 |url=http://www.wheatonarts.org/7926-2/past-exhibitions/1987-to-1989-exhibitions/1989-the-wistars-and-their-glass-1739-1777/ |publisher=[[WheatonArts]] |access-date=November 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franklin specified the materials to be used in the glass formula, and the globes were manufactured by [[Caspar Wistar (glassmaker)|Caspar Wistar]], a close associate of Franklin.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|page=75}} [[Wistarburgh Glass Works]] also made scientific glass for the Leyden jars Franklin used in the 1750s.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=75}}{{sfn|Bridenbaugh|2012|p=63}}

== Electrical principles ==

Franklin's experiments with Leyden jars progressed to connecting several Leyden jars together in a series, with "one hanging on the tail of the other". All of the jars in the series could be charged simultaneously, which multiplied the electrical effect.{{sfn|Cohen|1956|page=460}} A similar apparatus had been created earlier by [[Daniel Gralath]]. Franklin was the first to call the device an "[[electrical battery]]".{{sfn|Talbott|2005|p=185}} At that time, the word "battery" was a military term for a [[artillery battery|group of cannons]].{{sfn|Lynn|2009|page=136}} Franklin was the first to use "positive" and "negative" as applied to electricity which is sometimes referred to as "plus" and "minus".

Through his research, Franklin was among first to prove the electrical principal of [[conservation of charge]] in 1747{{sfn|Talbott|2005|p=184}}{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=72}}: a similar discovery was made independently in 1746 by [[William_Watson_(scientist)|William Watson]]. Franklin wrote detailed letters and documents about his experiments with the electrostatic machine and Leyden jars.{{sfn|Talbott|2005|p=184}}{{sfn|McNichol|2011|page=16}}{{sfn|Malmivuo|Plonsey|1995|p=13}} In 1749, Franklin made a list of several ways in which lightning was similar to electricity.{{sfn|Morgan|2003|p=12}} He concluded that [[lightning]] was essentially nothing more than giant electric sparks, similar to the sparks from the static charges produced by his electrostatic machine.{{sfn|Morgan|2003|p=12}} He referred to static electricity as "electric fire", "electric matter, or "electric fluid."{{sfn|Cohen|1956|page=460}} The term "electric fluid" was based on the idea that a jar could be filled and refilled when it became empty.{{sfn|Grimnes|2014|page=495}} That led to the revolutionary idea of "electrical fire" as a type of motion or current flow rather than a type of explosion.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|pages=72–75}}

Several 18th-century electric terms were derived from his name. For example, static electricity was known as "Franklin current", {{sfn|Grimnes|2014|page=496}} and "[[Franklinization]]" is a form of [[electrotherapy]] where Franklin shocked patients with strong static charges, to treat patients with various illnesses.{{sfn|Schiffer|2003|pages=136, 137}}&lt;ref name=Americana&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=1905 |title=Electro-therapeutics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v45RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PT429 |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia Americana: A universal reference library comprising the arts and sciences |publisher=[[Scientific American]] Compiling Department}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lightning rod invention==
[[File:Lightning safe study.jpg|right|thumb|upright 0.8|Kite apparatus for safe study of atmospheric electricity and lightning]]
{{See also|Thunder house}}
Franklin invented the [[lightning rod]] based on what he learned from experiments with his electrostatic machine. {{sfn|Maclean|1877|page=142}}{{sfn|Coulson|1950|page=32}} Franklin and his associates observed that pointed objects were more effective than blunt objects at "drawing off" and "throwing off" sparks from static electricity.{{sfn|Talbott|2005|p=182}}{{sfn|LeMay|1987|p=600}} This discovery was first reported by Hopkinson.{{sfn|Finger|2012|p=85}} Franklin wondered if this discovery could be used in a practical invention. {{sfn|Isaacson|2004|pp=137–145}} He thought something could be made to attract the electricity out of storm clouds, but first he had to verify that lightning bolts really are giant electric sparks.{{sfn|Isaacson|2004|pp=137–145}} He wrote Collinson and [[Cadwallader Colden]] letters about this theory.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|pp=86–96}} The 1752, Franklin letter to Collinson of October 19 of the [[kite experiment]] is noted by historian LeMay as a basis how it proved that lightning was electricity.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|pp=104-116}} Tom Tucker of the [[Isothermal Community College]] doubts the account, however, because of ambiguities in the account and points that out in his book ''Bolt of Fate: Benjamin Franklin and his Electric Kite Hoax.''{{sfn|Tucker|2005}}{{sfn|Matthews|2003}} Others disagree with this view, arguing that Franklin would not make up such a fake story because he valued the integrity of the scientific community.{{snf|Schiffer|2004}}{{sfn|Boese|2015}}

[[File:Casa del fulmine inv 1545 IF 41785.jpg|thumb|left|upright 0.75|A "thunder house" example]]
To test his theory, Franklin proposed a potentially deadly experiment, to be performed during an electrical storm, where a person would stand on an insulated stool inside a sentry box, and hold out a long, pointed iron rod to attract a lightning bolt.{{sfn|Cohen|1990|page=28}} A similar but less dangerous version of this experiment was first performed successfully [[Kite_experiment#Lightning_rod_experiments|in France On May 10]], 1752, and later repeated several more times throughout Europe, though after a [[Georg Wilhelm Richmann|fatality in 1753]] it was less frequently tried. Franklin declared that this "sentry-box experiment" showed that lightning and electricity were one and the same.{{sfn|Cohen|1990|page=28}}

Franklin realized that wooden buildings could be protected from lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on a rooftop, with the other end of the rod placed deep into the ground. The sharp point of the lightning rod would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt would hit the iron rod instead of the wooden building. The electric charge from the lightning would flow through the rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.{{sfn|Schafer|1992|p=58}}

Franklin's friend Kinnersley traveled throughout the eastern United States in the 1750s demonstrating man-made "lightning" on model [[thunder house]]s to show a how an iron rod placed into the ground would protect a wooden structure. He explained that lightning followed the same principles as the sparks from Franklin's electrostatic machine. These lectures by Kinnersley were widely advertised, and were one of the ways Franklin's lightning rod was demonstrated to the general public.{{sfn|Talbott|2005|p=188}}

[[File:Familiar Introduction to Electricity by Joseph Priestly, plate 7.jpg|thumb|right|upright 0.7| One of Joseph Priestley's &lt;br /&gt; "electrostatic machines"]]
{{main article|Luigi Galvani|Joseph Priestley}}
Franklin distributed copies of the electrostatic machine to many of his close associates to encourage them to study electricity.{{sfn|Lemay|2009|p=75}} Between 1747 and 1750, Franklin sent many letters to his friend Collinson in London about his experiments with the electrostatic machine and the Leyden jar, including his observations and theories on the principles of electricity.{{sfn|Talbott|2005|p=182}} These letters were collected and published in 1751 in a book entitled ''[[Experiments and Observations on Electricity]].''&lt;ref name=Letter/&gt;{{sfn|McNichol|2011|page=19}}{{sfn|Franklin|1751}}{{sfn|Cohen|1956|pages=432, 478}}

While [[Joseph Priestley]] was writing about the history of electricity, Franklin encouraged him to use an electrostatic machine to perform the experiments he was writing about. Priestly designed and used his own variations of Franklin's machine.{{sfn|Pyenson|Gauvin|2002|p=93}} While replicating the electrical experiments, some unanswered questions prompted Priestly to design additional experiments, leading to additional discoveries. In 1767, he published a 700-page book on his findings called ''[[The History and Present State of Electricity]].''{{sfn|Jackson|2005|pages=64–66}}{{sfn|Schofield|1997|pp=140–150}}

Eighteenth-century scientific laboratories usually contained some form of hand-operated electrostatic machine. Italian scientist [[Luigi Galvani]] had an electrostatic generator in his laboratory, where experiments with frog legs led to the discovery of [[animal electricity]].{{sfn|Avery|2016|p=207}} Another Italian scientist, [[Alessandro Volta]], disagreed with some of Galvani's ideas, and this scientific argument motivated Volta to develop the first frog-free [[galvanic cell]], and led directly to the invention of the first practical electric battery, the [[voltaic pile]].

After Franklin's death, two iconic artifacts from his research, the original "battery" of Leyden jars, and the "glass tube" that was a gift from Collinson in 1747, were given to the [[Royal Society]] in 1836 by [[Thomas Hopkinson]]'s grandson [[Joseph Hopkinson]], in accordance with Franklin's will.{{sfn|Cohen|1956|page=454B}}

The famous kite experiment enabled the Philadelphia group to established what had been surmised by others, that lightning was identical to the mild charge of electricity produced by the friction of the electrostatic machine. Franklin invented the lightning rod, which goes down in history as the first practical electrical invention.

The intent is to illustrate the hierarchical structure and relationship of events, accomplishments, criteria, and tasks.]]

In the [[United States Department of Defense]], the '''Integrated Master Plan''' ('''IMP)''' and the Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) are important [[program management]] tools that provide significant assistance in the planning and scheduling of work efforts in large and complex materiel acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''AFMC Pamphlet 63-5, Integrated Master Plan and Schedule Guide'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/USAF/USAF-AFMC/download.php?spec=AFMC_PAM_63-5.004210.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Air Force]] | date=11 Nov 2004 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMP is an event-driven plan  that documents the significant accomplishments necessary to complete the work and ties each accomplishment to a key program event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Integrated Master Plan (IMP) / Integrated Master Schedule (IMS)'' | url=https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=24654  | publisher=[[Defense Acquisition University]] | accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMP is expanded to a time-based IMS to produce a networked and multi-layered schedule showing all detailed tasks required to accomplish the work effort contained in the IMP. The IMS flows directly from the IMP and supplements it with additional levels of detail——both then form the foundations to implement an [[Earned Value Management| Earned Value Management System]].

* The IMP is a bilateral agreement between the Government and a contractor on what defines the “event-driven” program. The IMP documents the key events, accomplishments, and the evaluation "criteria" in the development, production and/or modification of a military system; moreover, the IMS provides sequential events and key decision points (generally meetings) to assess program progress. Usually the IMP is a contractual document.
* Supporting the IMP is the IMS that is made up of "tasks" depicting the work effort needed to complete the "criteria".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Scheduling Guide for Program Managers'' | url=http://www.dau.mil/publications/publicationsDocs/schedulinguide.pdf | format=PDF | publisher= Defense Systems Management College Press, Fort Belvoir, VA | date=October 2001 |accessdate=19 Jan 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a detailed time-driven plan for program execution that helps to ensure on-time delivery dates are achieved, and that tracking and status tool are used during program execution. These tools must show progress, interrelationships and dependencies.

In civic planning or [[urban planning]], ''Integrated Master Plan'' is used at the levels of city &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''City of Riverside, Wastewater Integrated Master Plan'' | url=http://www.riversideca.gov/pworks/masterplan-wastewater.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Integrated Master Plan for Lahore 2021'' | url=http://www.urbanunit.gov.pk/pubpublic/pubcomp/70.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; county,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Santa Clara County Parks, Draft Integrated Master Plan'' | url=http://sccgov.iqm2.com/Citizens/FileOpen.aspx?Type=4&amp;ID=101252}}&lt;/ref&gt; and state or province to refer to a document integrating diverse aspects of a [[public works]] project.

== Purpose and Objectives  ==
The primary purpose of the IMP—and the supporting detailed schedules of the IMS—is their use by the U.S. Government and Contractor acquisition team as the day-to-day tools for the planning, executing, and tracking program technical, schedule, and cost status, including risk mitigation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Integrated Master Plan and Integrated Master Schedule Preparation and Use Guide'' | url=http://www.acq.osd.mil/se/docs/IMP_IMS_Guide_v9.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |work=Ver. 0.9 |date=31 Oct 2005 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMP provides a better structure than either the [[Work breakdown structure|Work Breakdown Structure]] (WBS) or [[Organizational chart|Organizational Breakdown Structure]] (OBS) for measuring actual integrated master schedule (IMS) progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bachman, David C.| title=''Better Schedule Performance Assessments Derived From Integrated Master Plan-Referenced Schedule Metrics'' | url=http://www.dau.mil/pubscats/PubsCats/AR%20Journal/arj60/Bachman_ARJ60.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=[[Defense Acquisition University]] |date=October 2011 |work=Defense Acquisition Research Journal (ARJ) |pages=406–427 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary objective of the IMP is a single plan that establishes the program or project fundamentals. It provides a hierarchical, event-based plan that contains: Events; Significant accomplishments; Entry and exit criteria; however it does not include any dates or  durations. Using the IMP provides sufficient definition for explain program process and completion tracking, as well as providing effective communication of the program/project content and the "''What and How''" of the program.

== Rationale ==
The IMP is a collection of [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] (called  "events") that form the process architecture of the program. This means the sequence of events must always result in a deliverable product or service. While delivering products or services is relatively straight forward in some instances (i.e.,  list the tasks to be done, arrange them in the proper sequence, and execute to this “plan”), in other cases, problems often arise: (i) the description of "complete" is often missing for intermediate activities; (ii) program partners, integration activities, and subcontractors all have unknown or possibly unknowable impacts on the program; and (iii) as products or services are delivered the maturity of the program changes (e.g., quality and functionality expectations, as well as other attributes)——this maturity provided by defining "complete"
serves as an insurance policy against future problems encountered later in the program.

Often, it's easier to define the IMP by stating what it is not. The IMP is NOT BASED on calendar dates, and therefore it is not
schedule oriented; each event is completed when its supporting accomplishments are completed, and this completion is evidenced by the satisfaction of the criteria supporting each of the accomplishments. Furthermore, many of the IMP events are fixed by customer-defined milestones
(e.g., Preliminary or Critical Design Review, Production Deliver, etc.) while intermediate events are defined by the Supplier (e.g., integration and test, software build releases, Test Readiness Review, etc.).

The critical IMP attribute is its focus on events, when compared to effort or task focused planning.
The event focus asks and answers the question ''what does done look like?'' rather than what work has been done. Certainly work must be done to complete a task, but a focus solely on the work hides the more important metric of ''are we meeting our commitments?'' While meeting commitments is critical, it's important to first define the criteria used for judging if the commitments are being met. This is where Significant Accomplishments (SA) and their Accomplishment Criteria (AC) become important. It is important to meet commitments, but recognizing when the commitment has been met is even more important.

== Attributes and Characteristics ==

The IMP  provides Program Traceability by expanding and complying with the program's Statement of Objectives (SOO), Technical Performance Requirements (TPRs), the Contract [[Work Breakdown Structure]] (CWBS), and the Contract [[Statement of work|Statement of Work]] (CSOW)—all of which are based on the Customer's WBS to form the basis of the IMS and all cost reporting. The IMP implements a measurable and trackable program structure to accomplish integrated product development, integrate the functional program activities, and incorporates functional, lower-level and subcontractor  IMPs. The IMP provides a framework for independent evaluation of Program Maturity by allowing insight into the overall effort with a level-of-detail that is consistent with levied risk and complexity metrics. It uses the methodology of decomposing events into a logical series of accomplishments having measurable criteria to demonstrate the completion and/or quality of accomplishments.

== Requirements Flowdown ==

A Government customer tasks a Supplier to prepare and implement an IMP that linked with the IMS and integrated with the EVMS. The IMP list the contract requirements documents (e.g., Systems Requirements Document and Technical Requirements Document (i.e., the system specification or similar document)) as well as the IMP events  corresponding to development and/or production activities required by the contract. The IMP should include significant accomplishments encompassing all steps necessary to satisfy all contract objectives and requirements, manage all significant risks, and facilitate Government insight for each event. Significant accomplishments shall be networked to show their logical relationships and that they flow logically from one to another. The IMP, IMS, and EVMS products will usually include the prime contractor, subcontractor, and major vendor activities and products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''SMC-S-019, Rev. A'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/USAF/USAF-SMC/download.php?spec=SMC-S-019A_11AUG2008.021545.PDF | format=PDF | publisher=[[Space and Missile Systems Center]], Air Force Space Command, El Segundo, CA | date=11 Aug 2008 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation of an IMS ==

When evaluating a proposed IMS, the user should focus on realistic task durations, predecessor/successor relationships, and identification of [[critical path method|critical path]] tasks with viable risk mitigation and contingency plans. An IMS summarized at too high a level may result in obscuring critical execution elements, and contributing to failure of the EVMS to  report progress. A high-level IMS may fail to show related [[risk management]] approaches being used, which can  result in long duration tasks and artificial linkages masking the true critical path. In general, the IMP is a top-down planning tool and the IMS as the bottom-up execution tool. It should be noted, however, the IMS is a scheduling tool for management control of program progression, not for cost collection purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Systems Engineering Guide: Integrated Master Schedule (IMS)/Integrated Master Plan (IMP) Application'' | url=http://www.mitre.org/work/systems_engineering/guide/acquisition_systems_engineering/acquisition_program_planning/integrated_master_schedule_master_plan_application.html | publisher=Mitre Corporation] | date= |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An IMS would seek general consistency and a standardized approach to project planning, scheduling and analysis.  It may use guides such as the PASEG Generally Accepted Schedule Principles (GASP) as guidance to improve execution and enable EVMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
| title = Planning &amp; Scheduling Excellence Guide (PASEG), Version 3.0 
| url = https://www.humphreys-assoc.com/evms/planning-scheduling-excellence-guide-paseg-version-ta-a-175-t-1_25_32.html
| publisher = NDIA
| accessdate = 17 Nov 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to other Documents ==

The IMP/IMS are related to the product-based ''' [[Work Breakdown Structure]] (WBS)''' as defined in MIL-STD-881, by giving a second type of view on the effort, for different audiences or to provide a combination which gives better overall understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Department of Defense Standard: Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) for Defense Material Items (Superseding MIL-HDBK-881A)'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-STD/MIL-STD-0800-0899/download.php?spec=MIL-STD-881C.037590.pdf/ | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | date=3 Oct 2011 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linkage between the IMP/IMS and WBS is done by referencing the WBS numbering whenever the PE (Program Event), SA (Significant Accomplishment), or AC (Accomplishment Criteria) involves a deliverable product.

== Reporting Formats ==

The IMP is often called out as a contract data deliverable on [[United States Department of Defense]] materiel acquisitions, as well as other U.S. Government procurements. Formats for these deliverables are covered in [[Data Item Descriptions]] (DIDs) that define the data content, format, and data usages. Recently, the DoD  cancelled the DID (DI-MISC-81183A) that jointly addressed both the IMP and the IMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''DI-MISC-81183A, Data Item Description: Integrated Master Schedule (IMS)'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/DATA-ITEM-DESC-DIDs/DI-MISC/DI-MISC-81183A_11978/ | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | date=9 Feb 1996  |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement  documents include DI-MGMT-81650 (Integrated Master Schedule), DI-MGMT-81334A (Contract Work Breakdown Structure) and DI-MGMT-81466 (Contract Performance Report).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''DI-MGMT-81650, Data Item Description: Integrated Master Schedule (IMS)'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/DATA-ITEM-DESC-DIDs/DI-MGMT/DI-MGMT-81650_12009/ | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | date=30 Mar 2005  |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''DI-MISC-81334D, Data Item Description: Contract Work Breakdown Structure'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/DATA-ITEM-DESC-DIDs/DI-MGMT/download.php?spec=DI-MGMT-81334D.034122.pdf/ | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | date=18 May 2011  |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''DI-MISC-81466A, Data Item Description: Cost Performance Report (CPR)'' | url=http://www.everyspec.com/DATA-ITEM-DESC-DIDs/DI-MGMT/DI-MGMT-81466A_16102/ | format=PDF | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | date=30 Mar 2005 |accessdate=7 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition DFARS 252.242–7001 and 252.242–7002 provide guidance for integrating IMP/IMS with [[Earned Value Management]].

The '''International Association for Plant Taxonomy''' ('''IAPT''') promotes an understanding of [[plant]] [[biodiversity]], facilitates international communication of research between [[botany|botanists]], and oversees matters of uniformity and stability in plant names. The IAPT was founded on July 18, 1950 at the Seventh [[International Botanical Congress]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idIAPT|IAPT web site]].&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the IAPT headquarters is located in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]. Its current president, since 2017, is [[Patrick S. Herendeen]] of the [[Chicago Botanic Garden]]; vice-president is [[Gonzalo Nieto Feliner]] of the [[Real Jardín Botánico]], Madrid; and secretary-general is [[Karol Marhold]] of the Plant Science and Biodiversity Centre, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava.

Both the taxonomic journal '''''Taxon''''' and the series '''''Regnum Vegetabile''''' are published by the IAPT.  The latter series includes the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'', the ''Index Nominum Genericorum'', and ''Index Herbariorum''.

==Purpose==
The IAPT's primary purpose is the promotion and understanding of biodiversity—the discovery, naming, [[taxonomic classification|classification]], and [[systematics]] of plants—for both living and [[Paleobotany|fossil plants]]. Additionally, it promotes the study and [[conservation biology|conservation]] of plant biodiversity, and works to raise awareness of the general public to this issue. The organization also facilitates international cooperation among botanists working in the fields of plant systematics, [[plant taxonomy|taxonomy]], and [[botanical nomenclature|nomenclature]]. This is accomplished in part through sponsorship of meetings and publication of resources, such as reference publications and journals.

{{cquote | IAPT was founded in 1950 as a not-for-profit organisation for the purposes of publication of a periodical (''Taxon'') dealing with activities of the association and with objects of general importance for plant taxonomy, the publication of books and indices of utility for plant taxonomists (''Regnum Vegetabile''), the establishment and maintenance of committees for specific taxonomic and nomenclatural purposes, and the organization of international symposia on problems of plant systematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idIAPT2004|''Taxon'' '''53''' (1): 2]].&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The IAPT also seeks to achieve uniformity and stability in [[Botanical name|plant names]].  It accomplishes this through the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'', previously known as the ''International Code of Botanical Nomenclature'', and through the oversight of the International Bureau for Plant Taxonomy and Nomenclature.

==Publications and online resources==
===''Taxon''===
&lt;!-- [[Taxon (journal)]] redirects to this section. --&gt;
''Taxon''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISSN|0040-0262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the bi-monthly journal of the IAPT. The journal, which was initiated in 1951, publishes original papers and reviews dealing with systematic botany in the broadest sense. Preference is given to integrative papers combining the results of modern analysis with their consequences for classification. ''Taxon'' also contains matters related to [[botanical nomenclature]], and is the medium for the publication of both proposals to conserve or reject names&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idIAPT2004|''Taxon'' '''53''' (1): 2]].&lt;/ref&gt; and proposals to amend the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (ICN). Publication of such matters in ''Taxon'' satisfies the required submission to the General Committee. The journal also contains sections devoted to the International Organisation of Plant Biosystematics, reviews and notices of books and other publications, and news in the world of plant systematics.  Although the journal is "devoted to systematic and evolutionary biology with emphasis on botany",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idTAXON|TAXON - Journal of the IAPT]].&lt;/ref&gt; it has been in the past criticized for focusing overly on nomenclature and less on the principles and advancements made in the field of plant systematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idDavis1973|Davis &amp; Heywood 1973]], pp.33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Regnum Vegetabile''===
&lt;!-- [[Regnum Vegetabile]] redirects to this section. --&gt;
''Regnum Vegetabile''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISSN|0080-0694}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a published series of books on topics of interest to plant taxonomists. Many of the volumes are literature surveys or monographs in the area of plant systematics. There are several volumes of general use:
*''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (Vol. 159, 2018) The ''ICN'' is a set of rules and recommendations dealing with the formal names that are given to plants. The current edition is known as the "Shenzhen Code", as it was drafted in 2017 at the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress in Shenzhen, China.
*''International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants'', 8th edition (Vol. 151, 2010) Companion to the ''ICN'', this volume sets forth rules regarding the names of plant [[cultivar]]s.
*''Index Nominum Genericorum'' (Vols. 100-102 &amp; 113) An index of all published [[Genus|generic]] names covered by the ''ICN'', including the place of publication and information about the type species. The index is prepared in collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution. An electronic version is available [http://botany.si.edu/ing/ online].
*''Index Herbariorum'', the first six editions (Vol. 15, 31, 86, 92, 93, 106, 109, 114, 117, 120) A directory and guide to the [[Herbarium|herbaria]] of the world, including contact information, abbreviation codes, and important collections located in each herbarium. ''Index Herbariorum'' is now an online database, managed by The New York Botanical Garden, and available for [http://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/IndexHerbariorum.asp on-line searching].
*''International Directory of Botanical Gardens'' (Updated as Vol. 95, 1977) A directory to [[botanical garden]]s and [[Arboretum|arboreta]] around the world.

The series includes many additional volumes of interest to specialists in specific subdisciplines of botany, in addition to the ones listed above.

===Databases===
In addition to electronic versions of its print publications, the IAPT maintains the following:
* "Names in Current Use"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgbm.org/iapt/ncu/default.htm Names in Current Use (NCU)]&lt;/ref&gt; - A database of scientific names of extant botanical genera.

== Awards ==

The IAPT established two Engler Medals in honour of [[Adolf Engler]] in 1986: the Engler Medal in Gold awarded every six years for outstanding lifetime contributions to plant taxonomy and presented since 1987 at each International Botanical Congress (IBC), and the Engler Medal in Silver (medal sensu lato) awarded from 1987 to 2001 for a monograph or other work in systematic botany and presented from 1990 to 2002 at various meetings, congresses, symposia, etc. In 2002 the latter medal was divided into three awards for outstanding publications in these areas: the Engler Medal in Silver (medal sensu stricto) awarded for monographic or floristic plant systematics; the Stafleu Medal awarded for historical, bibliographic, and/or nomenclatural aspects of plant systematics; and the Stebbins Medal awarded for phylogenetic plant systematics and/or plant evolution. The medals honor [[Adolf Engler]] (24 Mar. 1844-10 Oct. 1930), [[Frans Antonie Stafleu]] (8 Sep. 1921-16 Dec. 1997), and [[George Ledyard Stebbins, Jr.]] (6 Jan. 1906-19 Jan. 2000).{{sfn|IAPT|2017}}

The '''International Carnivorous Plant Society''' ('''ICPS''') is a [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1972. It is the [[International Cultivar Registration Authority]] for [[carnivorous plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnivorousplants.org/about/aboutmain.html About the ICPS]. International Carnivorous Plant Society.&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2011, the society had around 1400 members.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, M. 2011. From the president. ''[[Carnivorous Plant Newsletter]]'' '''40'''(2): 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICPS is probably best known for its quarterly publication, the ''[[Carnivorous Plant Newsletter]]''.
__NOTOC__

==Conservation efforts==
The ICPS has set up the ''Nepenthes clipeata'' Survival Project (NcSP) to facilitate ''ex situ'' conservation of this species.&lt;ref name=NcSP&gt;Cantley, R., C.M. Clarke, J. Cokendolpher, B. Rice &amp; A. Wistuba 2004. [http://www.sarracenia.com/pubs/ncsp.doc ''Nepenthes clipeata'' Survival Project]. International Carnivorous Plant Society.&lt;/ref&gt; With only an estimated 15 plants remaining in the wild as of 1995, ''[[Nepenthes clipeata]]'' is the most [[endangered species|endangered]] of all known tropical [[pitcher plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, R.B. 1995. ''Nepenthes'' and conservation. ''Curtis's Botanical Magazine'' '''12''': 111–118.&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that there are only three or four genetically-distinct lines of "white market" (legally collected) plants in cultivation.&lt;ref name=NcSP /&gt;

The ICPS partially funded the establishment of The Rare ''Nepenthes'' Collection, which aims to conserve four of the rarest ''Nepenthes'' species: ''[[Nepenthes aristolochioides|N.&amp;nbsp;aristolochioides]]'', ''[[Nepenthes clipeata|N.&amp;nbsp;clipeata]]'', ''[[Nepenthes khasiana|N.&amp;nbsp;khasiana]]'', and ''[[Nepenthes rigidifolia|N.&amp;nbsp;rigidifolia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ziemer, B. 2010.

==Best Practices==
The availability of high quality biological and environmental specimens for research purposes requires the development of standardized methods for collection, long-term storage, retrieval and distribution of specimens that will enable their future use. Sharing successful strategies for accomplishing this goal is one of the driving forces for the International Society for Biological and Environmental Repositories (ISBER).

ISBER's Best Practices for Repositories (Best Practices) reflects the collective experience of its members and has received broad input from other repository professionals. Throughout this document effective practices are presented for the management of specimen collections and repositories. The term "Best Practice" is used in cases where a level of operation is indicated that is above the basic recommended practice or, more specifically, designates the most effective practice. It is understood that repositories in certain locations or with particular financial constraints may not be able to adhere to each of the items designated as "Best Practices". Repositories fitting into either of these categories will need to decide how they might best adhere to these recommendations within their particular circumstances. While adherence to ISBER Best Practices is strictly on a voluntary basis, it is important to note that some aspects of specimen management are governed by national/federal, regional and local regulations. The reader should refer directly to regulations for their national/federal, regional and local requirements, as appropriate.

The ISBER Best Practices are periodically reviewed and revised to reflect advances in research and technology. The third edition of the Best Practices builds on the foundation established in the first and second editions which were published in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

=== Self-Assessment Tool (SAT) ===
ISBER has created this Self-Assessment Tool(SAT) to assist repository operators in determining how well their repository follows the ISBER Best Practices for Repositories.The assessment is confidential and aimed at helping specimen collection centers strengthen their practices through the identification of areas in need of improvement.

ISBER provides a yearly anonymized SAT result summary, found on the ISBER website here [http://www.isber.org/?page=SATsummary].

==== SAT Information ====
The tool contains 158 questions which may be answered in a single or multiple sessions. Each page of the survey corresponds to a section of the ISBER Best Practices. Results from pilot tests indicated that the SAT takes a little over an hour to complete if all required information is available at the time of completing the survey. The tool is free to ISBER members, and non-members may participate for a fee.

After completion of the SAT, a personalized e-mail is sent to the participant which includes a "risk-balanced assessment score" and notification of top deviation areas to help the participant evaluate how their current practices conform to the ISBER Best Practices. The score is based on possible risk to the specimens, frequency of implementation of each practice, and the ease with which deviations can be detected.

==Biorepository Proficiency Testing Program==
Developed in collaboration with the Integrated Biobank of Luxembourg (IBBL), the Biorepository Proficiency Testing Program is designed to allow biorepositories to assess the accuracy of their quality control assays and characterization of biospecimens.  Participants can compare their results with those obtained in other laboratories and can identify testing issues that may be related to individual staff performance or calibration of instrumentation used in biospecimen quality control.  The program provides guidance to biorepositories so they can take appropriate remedial action to be in compliance with ISO/IEC 17043:2010, providing a necessary External Quality Assessment tool for biorepositories who wish to seek accreditation (ISO 17025, CLIA or equivalent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isber.org/?page=whypt |title=Why Proficiency Testing? |publisher=ISBER |date= |accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2222">The '''International Society for Biosemiotic Studies''' (ISBS) is an academic society for the researchers in [[semiotic biology]]. The Society was established in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Favareau, Don 2005. Founding a world biosemiotics institution: The International Society for Biosemiotic Studies. ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]'' 33(2): 481-485.&lt;/ref&gt; Its official journal is [[Biosemiotics (journal)|Biosemiotics]], published by [[Springer Science|Springer]] and launched in 2008. 

The purpose of the ISBS is to constitute an organizational framework for the collaboration among scholars dedicated to biosemiotic studies, including the [[interdisciplinary]] research of [[sign process]]es in [[living system]]s, organic codes, and [[biocommunication (science)|biocommunication]]. The ISBS attempts to develop the [[qualitative research]] methods in biology. Among the central focuses is also [[theoretical semiotics]] as a basis for [[theoretical biology]].

The ISBS assures the organization of regular meetings on research into the semiotics of nature, as well as promotes publication of scholarly work on the semiotics of life processes. The ISBS organizes the annual international conferences (''Gatherings in Biosemiotics'') that were started by Copenhagen and Tartu biosemioticians and have taken place regularly already since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claus Emmeche|Emmeche, Claus]] 2001.

The '''Island of California''' refers to a long-held Spanish misconception, dating from the 16th century, that the [[Baja California Peninsula]] was not part of mainland [[History of the west coast of North America|North America]] but rather a large island (spelled on early maps as Cali Fornia) separated from the continent by a strait now known as the [[Gulf of California]].

One of the most famous [[cartography|cartographic]] errors in history, it was propagated on many maps during the 17th and 18th centuries, despite contradictory evidence from various explorers. The legend was initially infused with the idea that California was a terrestrial paradise, like the [[Garden of Eden]] or [[Atlantis]].

== History ==
The first known mention of the legend of the "Island of California" was in the 1510 romance novel ''[[Las sergas de Esplandián]]'' by [[Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo]]—the sequel to Montalvo's more famous tales of [[Amadis de Gaula]], father of Esplandian. He described the island in this passage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Know, that on the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California very close to the side of the Terrestrial Paradise; and it is peopled by black women, without any man among them, for they live in the manner of [[Amazons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rodríguez de Montalvo |first= Garci |authorlink= Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo |year= 1526 |origyear= 1496 |title= Las sergas de Esplandián |trans-title=The Adventures of Esplandián |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWcBYnKWya0C&amp;pg=PA187&amp;q=%22mucho%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage |language= Spanish |quote= Sabed que ala diestra mano de las Indias ouo una Isla llamada California mucho llegada ala parte del paraiso terrenal la qual sue poblada de mugeres negras sin que algun uaro entre ellas ouiesse: que casi como las amazonas ...}} (The first mention of "California" occurs on the unnumbered page after page CVIII, in the right column.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is probable that this description prompted early explorers to misidentify the [[Baja California Peninsula]] as the island in these legends.

In 1533, [[Fortún Ximénez]], a mutineer on an exploring expedition sent by [[Hernán Cortés]], discovered the southern portion of Baja California, around present-day [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]]. He was killed by natives but his men returned to [[New Spain]] and gave report of their find. In 1535 Cortés arrived in the bay there and named the area Santa Cruz; he attempted to start a colony but abandoned his efforts after several years due to logistical problems. Cortés' limited information on southern Baja California apparently led to the naming of the region after the legendary California and to an initial but short-lived assumption that it was a large island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Polk |first= Dora Beale |title= The Island of California: A History of the Myth |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iKNqcBIbhqMC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=%22When+the+explorers+came+across+Baja,+what+they+thought+they+found+was+an+island.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7gDfq2SBuI&amp;sig=wp2shpmQMmFOlVo9Cu_HoALjcQI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uX-9U7mSE8GfyATM1YHgDQ&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22When%20the%20explorers%20came%20across%20Baja%2C%20what%20they%20thought%20they%20found%20was%20an%20island.%22&amp;f=false |publisher= [[University of Nebraska Press]] |date= 1995-10-01 |page= 105 |series= Spain in the West |isbn= 978-0-8032-8741-9 |quote= Cortés Believes Baja California to be an Island}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Portillo |first= Álvaro del |authorlink= Álvaro del Portillo |title= Descubrimientos y exploraciones en las costas de California, 1532–1650 |trans-title=Discoveries and explorations along the coast of California, 1532–1650 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nn3wEhP-8SYC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;dq=%22Sin+embargo,+es+indudable+que+Cort%C3%A9s,+el+envidiado,+habl%C3%B3+de+una+isla%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K8XztpLXn1&amp;sig=uSA22836B3mmYQKVHv2h_J7bg6E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=b5-9U9LCMY6byASF7oGYAQ&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sin%20embargo%2C%20es%20indudable%20que%20Cort%C3%A9s%2C%20el%20envidiado%2C%20habl%C3%B3%20de%20una%20isla%22&amp;f=false |year= 1982 |origyear= 1944 |edition= 2nd |language= Spanish |publisher= Ediciones Rialp |location= [[Madrid]] |page= 140 |isbn= 9788432121890 |quote= Sin embargo, es indudable que Cortés, el envidiado, habló de una isla de riqueza fantástica." ["However, it is clear that Cortés, with envy, spoke of a fantastic island of wealth."]}} (The 1944 edition was the author's doctoral thesis.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1539, Cortés sent the navigator [[Francisco de Ulloa]] northward along the Gulf and Pacific coasts of Baja California. Ulloa reached the mouth of the [[Colorado River]] at the head of the Gulf, which seemed to prove that the region was a peninsula rather than an island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Wood |first= Mark |title= The Island of California |url= http://magazine.pomona.edu/2014/spring/the-island-of-california/ |date= 2014-03-11 | website= Pomona College Magazine |publisher= [[Pomona College]]  |accessdate= 2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An expedition under [[Hernando de Alarcón]] ascended the lower Colorado River and confirmed Ulloa's finding. Maps published subsequently in Europe during the 16th century, including those by [[Gerardus Mercator]] and [[Abraham Ortelius]], correctly showed Baja California as a peninsula.

Despite this evidence, however, the depiction of California as an island revived in the early 17th century. One contributing factor may have been the second voyage of [[Juan de Fuca]] in 1592. De Fuca claimed to have explored the western coast of North America and to have found a large opening that possibly connected to the Atlantic Ocean — the legendary [[Northwest Passage]]. De Fuca's claim remains controversial because there is only one surviving written account of it found, his account as related to an Englishman, [[Michael Locke (merchant)|Michael Locke]]. Nonetheless, this account claims de Fuca found a large strait, with a large island at its mouth, at around 47° north [[latitude]]. The [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]] is in fact at around 48° N, as is the southern tip of the large island now called [[Vancouver Island]], while the northern reach of the Gulf of California terminates much farther south, at about 31° N. It is possible that explorers and mapmakers in the 17th century could have confused the two (if in fact they were aware of de Fuca's voyage), and in any case further exploration was inevitable. Indeed, the famed British explorer [[James Cook]] narrowly missed the Strait of Juan de Fuca in March 1778, almost 200 years later. Cook even named [[Cape Flattery]] (at the northwest tip of modern [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state) which is at the mouth of the strait, and instead stopped in [[Nootka Sound]] just off the west coast of Vancouver Island at about 49° N. His account states "we saw nothing like [the Strait of Juan de Fuca]; nor is there the least probability that ever any such thing existed."&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite book |title= A Voyage to the Pacific Ocean: Undertaken by the Command of His Majesty, for Making Discoveries in the Northern Hemisphere, to Determine the Position and Extent of the West Side of North America, its Distance from Asia, and the Practicability of a Northern Passage to Europe, ...|last1= Cook |first1= James |authorlink1= James Cook |publisher= W. and A.

A key role in changing ideas about California seems to have been played by an overland expedition led by the founding governor of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México]], [[Juan de Oñate]]. The expedition descended the Colorado River in 1604 and 1605, and its participants believed that they saw the Gulf of California continuing off to the northwest (presumably behind in the Sierra Cucapá into the Laguna Macuata Basin).

Reports from Oñate's expedition reached Antonio de la Ascención, a [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] friar who had participated in [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]]'s explorations of the west coast of California in 1602 and 1603. Ascención was a tireless propagandist in favor of Spanish settlement in California, and his later writings referred to the region as an island. As older maps confirm, Spanish authorities and local residents were well aware where the actual northern terminus of the Gulf of California lay, but by extending the coastline north past [[Cape Mendocino]] and eventually even into [[Puget Sound]], [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]]'s claim of [[Nova Albion]] for England (1579) could be invalidated by the priority of Cortes' claim (1533).

The first known reappearance of the Island of California on a map dates to 1622 in a map by Michiel Colijn of Amsterdam. The image became the standard for many later maps throughout the 17th century and intermittently into the 18th century. Previous maps show the Gulf terminating in its correct location. On the stretch of the Gulf between its actual terminus and Juan de Fuca's strait was written ''Mare Vermexo'' ("Red Sea"{{citation needed|date = August 2017}}) on later maps drawn from Spanish sources.

The [[Jesuit]] missionary and cartographer [[Eusebio Kino|Eusebio Francisco Kino]] revived the fact that Baja California was a peninsula. While studying in Europe, Kino had accepted the insularity of California, but when he reached Mexico he began to have doubts. He made a series of overland expeditions from northern [[Sonora]] to areas within or near the Colorado River's delta in 1698–1706, in part to provide a practical route between the Jesuits' missions in Sonoran and Baja California but also to resolve the geographical question. Kino satisfied himself that a land connection must exist, and the 18th century Jesuits generally followed his example. The first report of Kino's discovery and his map from 1701 showing California as a peninsula were sent to Europe by [[Marcus Antonius Kappus]], a [[Jesuit]] missionary from [[Kamna Gorica, Radovljica|Kamna Gorica]] ([[Duchy of Carniola]], now Slovenia). In a June 1701 letter, he wrote about that to his friend Philippus Alberth in Vienna and thus acted as an important intermediary in the dissemination of this knowledge. However, Juan Mateo Manje, a military companion on several of Kino's treks, expressed scepticism; European cartographers remained divided on the question.

Jesuit missionary-explorers in Baja California who attempted to lay the issue finally to rest included Juan de Ugarte (1721), [[Ferdinand Konščak]] (1746), and [[Wenceslaus Linck]] (1766). The matter was settled beyond all dispute when the expeditions of [[Juan Bautista de Anza]] traveled between Sonora and the west coast of California in the period 1774–1776.

[[File:Jonas Acukas.jpg|thumb|right|Jonas Asevičius-Acukas in 1921]]
'''Jonas Asevicius-Acus-Acukas''' (July 29, 1885 in [[Jieznas]] – July 11, 1976 in [[Kaunas]]) was a [[Lithuania]]n army officer and chemist. From 1909 to 1918, he served in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] at [[Kaunas Fortress]]. He fought in the [[First World War]] and the [[Russian Civil War]]. In 1921 he returned to Lithuania and was mobilized into the [[Lithuanian Armed Forces]], where he attained the rank of [[colonel]] (1927) and served until 1940. Acus graduated from [[Vytautas Magnus University]] in 1930. He lectured on chemistry and commodity science at Vytautas Magnus University (1934–1940), [[Vilnius University]] (1940–1950), and [[Lithuanian University of Agriculture]] (1951–1957). He wrote textbooks on foundations of commodity science (1949) and a short course in [[physical chemistry]] (1957). Acus was awarded the Commander's Crosses of the [[Order of Vytautas the Great]] (1938) and the [[Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas]] (1928).

'''''Khôra''''' (also '''''chora'''''; {{lang-grc|χώρα}}) was the territory of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] ''[[polis]]'' outside the city proper. The term has been used in [[philosophy]] by [[Plato]] to designate a receptacle (as a “third kind” [''triton genos'']; ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 48e4), a space, a material substratum, or an interval. In Plato's account, ''khôra'' is neither being nor nonbeing but an interval between in which the "[[Theory of Forms|forms]]" were originally held; it "gives space" and has maternal overtones (a womb, matrix). [[Jacques Derrida]] has written a short text with the title ''Khôra'',&lt;ref&gt;Derrida J., ''Khôra'', Paris: Galilée 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; using his [[deconstruction]]ist approach to investigate Plato's word usage. It is the origin for the recent interest in this rather obscure Greek term.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Overview==
Key authors addressing ''khôra'' include [[Martin Heidegger]], who refers to a "clearing" in which being happens or takes place. [[Julia Kristeva]] deploys the term as part of her analysis of the difference between the semiotic and symbolic realms, in that Plato's concept of "''khora''" is said to anticipate the emancipatory employment of semiotic activity as a way of evading the allegedly phallocentric character of symbolic activity (signification through language), which, following [[Jacques Lacan]], is regarded as an inherently limiting and oppressive form of ''[[Praxis (process)|praxis]]''.

Julia Kristeva articulates the ''khôra'' in terms of a presignifying state: "Although the ''khôra'' can be designated and regulated, it can never be definively posited: as a result, one can situate the ''khôra'' and, if necessary, lend it a topology, but one can never give it axiomatic form."&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, J. 1984 ''Revolution in Poetic Language''. New York, Columbia University Press. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Derrida uses ''khôra'' to name a radical otherness that "gives place" for being. [[Nader El-Bizri]] builds on this by more narrowly taking ''khôra'' to name the radical happening of an ontological difference between being and beings.&lt;ref&gt;([[Nader El-Bizri]], 2004, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  El-Bizri's reflections on "''khôra''" are taken as a basis for tackling the meditations on ''dwelling'' and on ''being and space'' in [[Heidegger]]'s thought and the critical conceptions of space and place as they evolved in [[architectural theory]] and in history of philosophy and science, with a focus on geometry and optics.&lt;ref&gt;([[Nader El-Bizri]], 2001, 2004, 2011, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida argues that the [[subjectile]] is like Plato’s ''khôra'', Greek for space, receptacle or site. Plato proposes that the ''khôra'' rests between the sensible and the intelligible, through which everything passes but in which nothing is retained. For example, an image needs to be held by something, just as a mirror will hold a reflection. For Derrida, ''khôra'' defies attempts at naming or either/or logic,  which he "deconstructs". See also Derrida's collaborative project with architect [[Peter Eisenmann]], in ''Chora L Works: Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Chora-Works-Jacques-Derrida-Eisenman/dp/1885254407 ''Chora L Works: Jacques Derrida and Peter Eisenman'']&lt;/ref&gt; The project proposed the construction of a garden in the [[Parc de la Villette]] in Paris, which included a sieve, or harp-like structure that Derrida envisaged as a physical metaphor for the receptacle-like properties of the ''khôra''. The concept of the ''khôra'', distinguished by its elusive properties, would have become a physical reality had the project been realised.

Following Derrida, [[John Caputo]] describes ''khôra'' as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
neither present nor absent, active or passive, the good nor evil, living nor nonliving  - but rather atheological and nonhuman - ''khôra'' is not even a receptacle. ''Khôra'' has no meaning or essence, no identity to fall back upon.  She/it receives all without becoming anything, which is why she/it can become the subject of neither a philosopheme nor mytheme.  In short, the ''khôra'' is tout autre [fully other], very.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Caputo|1997|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt; If, as one contributor concludes, "''khôra''" means "space", it is an interesting space that "at times appears to be neither this nor that, at times both this and that," wavering "between the logic of exclusion and that of participation." (Derrida, ''The Name'', 89).

The '''Malagasy giant rat''' (''Hypogeomys antimena''), also known as the '''votsotsa''' or '''votsovotsa''', is a [[Nesomyidae|nesomyid]] [[rodent]] found only in the [[Menabe]] region of [[Madagascar]].&lt;ref name = MSW3&gt;{{MSW3 Muroidea | id = 13000135 | pages =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an endangered species due to habitat loss, slow reproduction, and limited range (200 square kilometres north of [[Morondava]], between the rivers Tomitsy and Tsiribihina) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=S. Sommer  |author2=H.

It is the only [[extant taxon|extant]] species in the genus ''[[Hypogeomys]]''; another species, ''[[Hypogeomys australis]]'', is known from [[subfossil]] remains a few thousand years old.

[[Image:Malagasy Giant Rat (Hypogeomys antimena).jpg|thumb|left|250px|A Malagasy giant rat]]

==Physical description==
Malagasy giant rats have an appearance somewhat similar to [[rabbit]]s, though maintaining many rat-like features especially in the face. Males and females both grow to roughly rabbit-size, around {{convert|1.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and {{convert|33|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}, though with an additional {{convert|20|–|25|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} of dark tail. They have a coarse coat which varies from gray to brown to reddish, darkening around the head and fading to white on the belly. They also have prominent, pointed ears and long, muscular back legs, used for jumping to avoid predators. They can leap almost {{convert|3|ft|cm|abbr=on}} in the air, for which reason they are sometimes called '''giant jumping rats'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.mongabay.com/2005/0509-rhett_butler.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction and maturation==
The male Malagasy giant rat reaches sexual maturity within one year, but will not mate until they reach 1.5 to two years. The female Malagasy giant rat reaches sexual maturity in two years. These rats are one of the few rodent species to practice [[sexual monogamy]].&lt;ref name="Edge"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/species_info.php?id=95 | title=Edge of Existence: Malagasy Giant Rat | publisher=Zoological Society of London | accessdate=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once mated, a pair will stay together until one of them dies. On the death of a mate, females tend to remain in the burrow until a new male is found. While males usually wait for a new mate as well, they do occasionally move to live with a widowed female. Females give birth to a single offspring after a gestation of 102–138 days (number observed in captivity) once or twice during the mating season, which coincides with the Madagascar [[rainy season]] from December to April. The young are raised by both parents, remaining in the family burrow for the first 4–6 weeks, then increasingly exploring and foraging outside. Young males stay with the family unit for one year before achieving sexual maturity and leaving to find their own burrow. Females do not mature for 2 years and remain with their parents for the extra year. Males are extremely protective of their young. They are known to increase their own predation risk to follow or defend their offspring.

==Lifestyle and behavior==
Completely [[nocturnal]], the giant rats live in burrows up to {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} across with as many as 6 entrances. Entrances, even those in regular use, are kept blocked by dirt and leaves to discourage predation by the [[Malagasy ground boa]].&lt;ref name="Animal Diversity"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Hypogeomys_antimena.html | title=Animal Diversity Web: Hypogeomys antimena | publisher=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology | accessdate=December 10, 2011 | author=Cates, Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The other main traditional predatory threat is the puma-like [[fossa (animal)|fossa]] but increasingly feral dogs and cats introduced to the island are hunting them as well. When foraging, the rats move on all fours, searching the forest floor for fallen fruit, nuts, seeds, and leaves. They have also been known to strip bark from trees and dig for roots and invertebrates. Pairs are highly territorial and both members will defend their territory from other rats. They mark their territory with [[urine]], [[feces]], and scent gland secretions.

==Conservation and efforts==
The Malagasy giant rat is listed as endangered. Limited range, habitat destruction, increased predation by non-native feral dogs and cats, and disease have all led to the decline.&lt;ref name=IUCN /&gt; Many feral cats also carry a parasite called [[toxoplasmosis]]. The parasite causes rodents to lose their fear of cats, to the point of almost being attracted to cats, which allows them to be caught and killed more easily.  [[Hantavirus]] is another rodent disease that is ravaging the population that causes kidney failure.

The Madagascan Government has enacted laws to protect the rat. Much of their territory is now the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests#Kirindy Forest|Kirindy Forest Reserve]] where sustainable forestry is practiced. They have also introduced policies that help the inhabitants of the island coexist with the animals that live there. Gerald Durrell was the first scientist to breed the rats in captivity.&lt;ref name = "Durrell"&gt;{{cite web|title=Malagasy Giant Jumping Rat|url=http://www.durrell.org/Animals/Mammals/Madagascar-giant-jumping-rat/|publisher=Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust|accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, he brought five specimens to [[Jersey]]. Since then, 16 breeding programs have been set up and 12 have been successful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22681">'''Mobilities''' is a contemporary [[paradigm]] in the [[social science]]s that explores the movement of people ([[Human migration]], [[travel]], [[transport]]), ideas (see e.g. [[meme]]) and things (transport), as well as the broader social implications of those movements.

A mobility "turn" (or transformation) in the social sciences began in the 1990s in response to the increasing realization of the historic and contemporary importance of movement on individuals and society. This turn has been driven by generally increased levels of mobility and new forms of mobility where bodies combine with information and different patterns of mobility. The mobilities paradigm incorporates new ways of theorizing about how these mobilities lie "at the center of constellations of power, the creation of identities and the microgeographies of everyday life." ([[Tim Cresswell|Cresswell]], 2011, 551)

The mobility turn arose as a response to the way in which the social sciences had traditionally been static, seeing movement as a [[black box]] and ignoring or trivializing "the importance of the systematic movements of people for work and family life, for leisure and pleasure, and for politics and protest" (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 208). Mobilities emerged as a critique of contradictory orientations toward both [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentarism]] and deterritorialisation in social science. People had often been seen as static entities tied to specific places, or as [[nomad]]ic and placeless in a frenetic and [[globalization|globalized]] existence. Mobilities looks at movements and the forces that drive, constrain and are produced by those movements.

Several typologies have been formulated to clarify the wide variety of mobilities. Most notably, John Urry&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J. 2000 Sociology Beyond Societies: Mobilities for the Twenty-First Century. London:  Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Urry, J., 2007. Mobilities. Cambridge: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt; divides mobilities into five types: mobility of objects, corporeal mobility, imaginative mobility, virtual mobility and communicative mobility. Later, Leopoldina Fortunati and Sakari Taipale&lt;ref&gt;Fortunati, L. &amp; Taipale, S. 2017. Mobilities and the Network of Personal Technologies: Refining the Understanding of Mobility Structure. Telematics and Informatics, 34(2), 560–568. https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2016.09.011 &lt;/ref&gt; proposed an alternative typology taking the individual and the human body as a point of reference. They differentiate between ‘macro-mobilities’ (consistent physical displacements), ‘micro-mobilities’ (small-scale displacements), ‘media mobility’ (mobility added to the traditionally fixed forms of media) and ‘disembodied mobility’ (the transformation in the social order). The categories are typically considered interrelated, and therefore they are not exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Taipale, S. 2013. Mobilities in Finland’s Information Society Strategies from 1995 to 2010, Mobilities, 8(2), 293-311. https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17450101.2012.655975 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taipale, S. 2014. The dimensions of mobilities: The spatial relationships between corporeal and digital mobilities. Social Science Research 43C, 157-167, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssresearch.2013.10.003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==

While mobilities is commonly associated with [[sociology]], contributions to the mobilities literature have come from scholars in [[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[economics]], [[geography]], [[migration studies]], [[science and technology studies]], and [[tourism geography|tourism]] and [[transport]] studies. (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 207)

Mobilities as a specific body of research remains associated with a small group of largely British researchers, notably [[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]], [[Mimi Sheller]], Peter Adey, Tim Edensor, David Bissell, and [[Tim Cresswell]]. However, Cresswell (2011, 555) notes that "many people involved in research on mobility topics do not see themselves as part of a new paradigm or turn" (e.g. [[Noel B. Salazar]]). The community of mobilities researchers, as well as the areas they research, have expanded across the globe.

The eponymous journal ''Mobilities'' provides a list of typical subjects which have been explored in the mobilities paradigm (Taylor and Francis, 2011):
* Mobile spatiality and temporality
* [[sustainable mobility|Sustainable]] and alternative mobilities
* Mobile rights and risks
* New [[social networks]] and [[mobile media]]
* Immobilities and [[social exclusion]]s
* [[Tourism]] and [[travel]] mobilities
* [[Human migration|Migration]] and [[diaspora]]s
* [[Transportation]] and [[communication technologies]]
* Transitions in complex systems

==Origins==

Sheller and Urry (2006, 215) place mobilities in the sociological tradition by defining the primordial theorist of mobilities as [[Georg Simmel]] (1858–1918). Simmel's essays, "Bridge and Door" (Simmel, 1909 / 1994) and "The Metropolis and Mental Life" (Simmel, 1903 / 2001) identify a uniquely human will to connection, as well as the urban demands of tempo and precision that are satisfied with mobility.

The more immediate precursors of contemporary mobilities research emerged in the 1990s (Cresswell 2011, 551). Historian [[James Clifford (historian)|James Clifford]] (1997) advocated for a shift from deep analysis of particular places to the routes connecting them. [[Marc Augé]] (1995) considered the philosophical potential of an anthropology of "non-places" like [[airport]]s and [[motorway]]s that are characterized by constant transition and temporality. Sociologist [[Manuel Castells]] outlined a "network society" and suggested that the "space of places" is being surpassed by a "space of flows." Feminist scholar [[Caren Kaplan]] (1996) explored questions about the gendering of metaphors of travel in social and cultural theory.

The contemporary paradigm under the moniker "mobilities" appears to originate with the work of sociologist [[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]]. In his book, ''Sociology Beyond Societies: Mobilities for the Twenty-First Century'', Urry (2000, 1) presents a "manifesto for a sociology that examines the diverse mobilities of peoples, objects, images, information and wastes; and of the complex interdependencies between, and social consequences of, these diverse mobilities."

This is consistent with the aims and scope of the eponymous journal ''Mobilities'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rmob20/current#.VKZE_ZOZE_Y ''Mobilities''] ({{ISSN|1745-0101}} (print), {{ISSN|1745-011X}} (online))&lt;/ref&gt; which "examines both the large-scale movements of people, objects, capital, and information across the world, as well as more local processes of daily transportation, movement through public and private spaces, and the travel of material things in everyday life" (Taylor and Francis, 2011).

In 2006, Mimi Sheller and John Urry published an oft-cited paper that examined the mobilities paradigm as it was just emerging, exploring its motivations, theoretical underpinnings, and methodologies. Sheller and Urry specifically focused on [[automobility]] as a powerful socio-technical system that "impacts not only on local [[public space]]s and opportunities for coming together, but also on the formation of gendered subjectivities, familial and social networks, spatially segregated urban neighborhoods, national images and aspirations to modernity, and global relations ranging from transnational migration to terrorism and [[oil war]]s" (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 209).

Mobilities can be viewed as an extension of the "[[spatial turn]]" in the arts and sciences in the 1980s, in which scholars began "to interpret space and the spatiality of human life with the same critical insight and interpretive power as have traditionally been given to time and history (the historicality of human life) on one hand, and to social relations and society (the sociality of human life) on the other" (Sheller and Urry, 2006, 216; Engel and Nugent, 2010, 1; Soja, 1999 / 2005, 261).

Engel and Nugent (2010) trace the conceptual roots of the spatial turn to [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Henri Lefebvre]] (1974), although [[Fredric Jameson]] appears to have coined the epochal usage of the term for the 1980s paradigm shift. Jameson (1988 / 2003, 154) notes that the concept of the spatial turn "has often seemed to offer one of the more productive ways of distinguishing postmodernism from modernism proper, whose experience of temporality -- existential time, along with deep memory -- it is henceforth conventional to see as dominant of the high modern."

For Oswin &amp; Yeoh (2010) mobility seems to be inextricably intertwined with late-modernity and the end of the nation-state. The sense of mobility makes us to think in migratory and tourist fluxes as well as the necessary infrastructure for that displacement takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Oswin, N. Y., Yeoh, B. "Introduction: Mobile City Singapore". ''Mobilities'' Vol. 5 (2), 2010, pp. 167-175.&lt;/ref&gt; R. Tzanelli (2014) explains that modernity has recycled the human emotions, particularly trauma, whatever their cause may be, to generate a logic of spectacle.  Any mediated and consumed event not only destroys the previous states of conflicts and cleavages, but provides a one-sided ideological message to visitors. Tourism is for Tzanelli more than a mechanism to control, it is an instrument of [[ideology]]. The efficacy for state to reduce the discrepancy and discontent of citizenry consists in commoditizing the human suffering into affordable products.&lt;ref&gt;Tzanelli, R. (2014). "Embodied art and aesthetic performativity in the London 2012 handover to Rio (2016)". ''Global Studies Journal'', 6(2), 13-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

P. Vannini (2012) opted to see mobility as a projection of existent cultural values, expectances and structures that denotes styles of life. Mobility after all would not only generate effects on people's behaviour but also specific styles of life. Vannini explains convincingly that on [[Canada]]'s coast, the values of islanders defy the hierarchal order in populated cities from many perspectives. Islanders prioritize the social cohesion and trust of their communities before the alienation of mega-cities. There is a clear physical isolation that marks the boundaries between urbanity and rurality. From another view, nonetheless, this ideological dichotomy between authenticity and alienation leads residents to commercialize their spaces to outsiders. Although the tourism industry is adopted in these communities as a form of activity, many locals have historically migrated from urban populated cities.&lt;ref&gt;Vannini, P. (2012). ''Ferry Tales: Mobility, places and time on Canada's West Coast''. New York, [[Routledge]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobilities and transportation geography==

The intellectual roots of mobilities in sociology distinguish it from traditional transportation studies and [[transportation geography]], which have firmer roots in mid 20th century [[Positivism|positivist]] spatial science.

Cresswell (2011, 551) presents six characteristics distinguishing mobilities from prior approaches to the study of migration or transport:

* Mobilities often links science and social science to the [[humanities]].
* Mobilities often links across different scales of movement, while traditional transportation geography tends to focus on particular forms of movement at only one scale (such as local traffic studies or household travel surveys).
* Mobilities encompasses the movement of people, objects, and ideas, rather than narrowly focusing on areas like passenger [[modal shift]] or [[freight logistics]].
* Mobilities considers both motion and "stopping, stillness and relative immobility."
* Mobilities incorporates mobile theorization and methodologies to avoid the privileging of "notions of boundedness and the sedentary."
* Mobilities often embraces the political and differential politics of mobility, as opposed to the apolitical, "objective" stance often sought by researchers associated with engineering disciplines

Mobilities can be seen as a postmodern descendant of modernist [[transportation studies]], with the influence of the spatial turn corresponding to a "[[post-structuralist]] agnosticism about both naturalistic and universal explanations and about single-voiced historical narratives, and to the concomitant recognition that position and context are centrally and inescapably implicated in all constructions of knowledge" (Cosgrove, 1999, 7; Warf and Arias, 2009).

Despite these [[ontological]] and [[epistemological]] differences, Shaw and Hesse (2010, 207) have argued that mobilities and transport geography represent points on a continuum rather than incompatible extremes. Indeed, traditional transport geography has not been wholly quantitative any more than mobilities is wholly qualitative. Sociological explorations of mobility can incorporate empirical techniques, while model-based inquiries can be tempered with richer understandings of the meanings, representations and assumptions inherently embedded in models.

Shaw and Sidaway (2010, 505) argue that even as research in the mobilities paradigm has attempted to reengage transportation and the social sciences, mobilities shares a fate similar to traditional transportation geography in still remaining outside the mainstream of the broader academic geographic community.

==Theoretical underpinnings of Mobilities==

Sheller and Urry (2006, 215-217) presented six bodies of theory underpinning the mobilities paradigm:

The prime theoretical foundation of mobilities is the work of early 20th-century sociologist [[Georg Simmel]], who identified a uniquely human "will to connection," and provided a theoretical connection between mobility and materiality. Simmel focused on the increased tempo of [[urban sociology|urban life]], that "drives not only its social, economic, and [[urban infrastructure|infrastructural]] formations, but also the psychic forms of the urban dweller." Along with this tempo comes a need for precision in timing and location in order to prevent chaos, which results in [[complexity|complex]] and novel systems of relationships.

A second body of theory comes from the science and technology studies which look at mobile sociotechnical systems that incorporate hybrid geographies of human and nonhuman components. [[Automobile]], [[rail transport|rail]] or [[air transport]] systems involve complex [[transport network]]s that affect society and are affected by society. These networks can have dynamic and enduring parts. Non-transport information networks can also have unpredictable effects on encouraging or suppressing physical mobility (Pellegrino 2012).

A third body of theory comes from the [[postmodern]] conception of [[spatiality]], with the substance of places being constantly in [[Motion (physics)|motion]] and subject to constant reassembly and reconfiguration (Thrift 1996).

A fourth body of theory is a "recentring of the corporeal body as an affective vehicle through which we sense place and movement, and construct emotional geographies". For example, the car is "experienced through a combination of senses and sensed through multiple registers of motion and emotion″ (Sheller and Urry 2006, 216).

A fifth body of theory incorporates how [[topologies]] of social networks relate to how complex [[pattern formation|patterns form and change]]. Contemporary information technologies and ways of life often create broad but weak social ties across time and space, with [[interpersonal relationships|social life]] incorporating fewer chance meetings and more networked connections.

Finally, the last body of theory is the analysis of complex transportation systems that are "neither perfectly ordered nor anarchic." For example, the rigid spatial coupling, operational timings, and historical bindings of rail contrast with unpredictable environmental conditions and ever-shifting political winds. And, yet, "change through the accumulation of small repetitions...could conceivably tip the [[car dependence|car system]] into the [[car-free movement|postcar system]]."

==Mobilities methodologies==

Mimi Sheller and John Urry (2006, 217-219) presented seven methodological areas often covered in mobilities research:

* Analysis of the patterning, timing and causation of face-to-face co-presence
* Mobile [[ethnography]] - participation in patterns of movement while conducting ethnographic research
* Time-space diaries - subjects record what they are doing, at what times and in what places
* Cyber-research - exploration of virtual mobilities through various forms of electronic connectivity
* Study of experiences and feelings
* Study of memory and private worlds via photographs, letters, images and souvenirs
* Study of in-between places and transfer points like lounges, waiting rooms, cafes, amusement arcades, parks, hotels, airports, stations, motels, harbors

'''Nuummite''' is a rare [[metamorphic]] rock that consists of the [[amphibole]] minerals [[gedrite]] and [[anthophyllite]]. It is named after the area of [[Nuuk]] in Greenland, where it was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|EditorSurname1=Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS)|Periodical=Geology and Ore|Title=Minerals in Greenland |Issue=12|Year=2008|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;12|Date=  2008|language=German|URL=http://www.geus.dk/minex/go12.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ClassicGems&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuumite|url=http://www.classicgems.net/gem_nuummite.htm|publisher=ClassicGems.net|accessdate=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GEUS7&gt;{{cite web|title=Gemstones of Greenland|url=http://www.geus.dk/minex/go07.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2012|work=Geology and Ore|issue=7|date=January 2007|publisher=Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Nuummite is usually black in colour and opaque. It consists of two  [[amphibole]]s, [[gedrite]] and [[anthophyllite]], which form [[exsolution]] lamellae that give the rock its typical [[iridescence]]. Other common minerals in the rock are [[pyrite]], [[pyrrhotite]] and [[chalcopyrite]], which form shimmering yellow bands in polished specimens.

In [[Greenland]] the rock was formed by two consecutive metamorphic overprints of an originally igneous rock.&lt;ref name=GEUS7/&gt; The intrusion took place in the [[Archean]] around 2800 million years ago and the metamorphic overprint was dated at 2700 and 2500 million years ago.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==History==
The rock was first discovered in 1810 in Greenland  by the mineralogist K. L. Giesecke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=K. Secher &amp; P. Appel|title=Gemstones of Greenland - Exploration and Mining in Greenland.|journal=Geology and Ore|date=January 2007|volume=7|url=http://www.geus.dk/minex/go07-uk.htm|accessdate=8 November 2012|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was defined scientifically by O. B. Bøggild between 1905 and 1924.&lt;ref name=ChamRodg&gt;{{cite journal|author=P. E. Champness, K. A.

[[James Oglethorpe|James Edward Oglethorpe]] founded the [[Province of Georgia|Georgia Colony]], and the town of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], on February 12, 1733 (February 1, 1732  by the Julian calendar used in the British colonies until September 2, 1752). The new Georgia colony was authorized under a grant from [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] to a group constituted by Oglethorpe as the [[Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America]], or simply the Georgia Trustees. The new colony was bounded by the [[Savannah River]] on the north and the [[Altamaha River]] to the south, while the western boundary reached almost to the  [[Mississippi River]] and lands claimed by France as part of [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]]. Not until 1763 did the French formally cede this territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain,&lt;ref&gt;"Louisiane", in ''Le Petit Robert des Noms Propres'' encyclopedia, Paris, 1999, p. 1255.&lt;/ref&gt; but Spain still claimed a considerable portion of it. Much of the territory ultimately became American in 1795, when the United States resolved its [[West Florida]] boundary dispute with Spain.&lt;ref&gt;"Mississippi", in ''The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia'', New York, 1994, p. 567.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Oglethorpe's plan for settlement of the new colony had been in the works since 1730, three years before the founding of Savannah. The multifaceted plan sought to achieve several goals through interrelated policy and design elements, including the spacing of towns, the layout of towns and eventually their surrounding counties, equitable allocation of land, and limits to growth to preserve a sustainable agrarian economy.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Oglethorpe Plan'', 37-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical significance==

The Oglethorpe Plan was an embodiment of all of the major themes of the Enlightenment, including science, humanism, and secular government. Georgia became the only American colony infused at its creation with Enlightenment ideals: the last of the Thirteen Colonies, it would become the first to embody the principles later embraced by the Founders. Remnants of the Oglethorpe Plan exist today in Savannah, showcasing a town plan that retains the vibrancy of ideas behind its conception.

At the heart of Oglethorpe’s comprehensive and multi-faceted plan there was a vision of social equity and civic virtue. The mechanisms supporting that vision, including yeoman governance, equitable land allocation, stable land tenure, prohibition of slavery, and secular administration, were among the ideas debated during the British Enlightenment. Many of those ideals have been carried forward, and are found today in Savannah’s Tricentennial Plan and other policy documents.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Oglethorpe Plan'', 134-35, 189-192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fries, ''The Urban Idea in Colonial America'', 138-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources for the Oglethorpe Plan==

The [[Grand Model for the Province of Carolina]] was cited by the Georgia Trustees as a source of their plan for Georgia, although with the major difference that it would have neither aristocracy nor slavery.  Oglethorpe wrote that the plan was conceived with "toleration" and "wholesome regulations."&lt;ref&gt;James Oglethorpe, "A New and Accurate Account"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Martyn]], the Trustees secretary, wrote, "We are indebted to the Lord Shaftsbury, and that truly wise man Mr. Locke, for the excellent laws which they drew up for the first settlement of Carolina."&lt;ref&gt;"Reasons for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America," written by Benjamin Martyn for the Trustees in 1732.&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources are speculative, since they were not cited by Oglethorpe of the Trustees. Such possible inspirations include classical planning concepts dating to [[Vitruvius]] and Roman colonial planning (e.g., [[Timgad]]), Renaissance concepts of the [[ideal city]], and later plans such as the [[Vauban]] plan of [[Neuf-Brisach]].&lt;ref&gt;Reps, ''Making of Urban America'', 195-202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 38-40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable comments==
[[File:Savannah-four-wards.png|thumb|Sketch of Savannah's Town Plan showing four cellular wards, each containing eight city blocks around a square (four residential blocks in the corners, each split by a narrow lane, plus four smaller commercial blocks east and west of the square)]]
Many prominent planners and urban theorists have commented on various attributes of the Oglethorpe Plan, particularly the layout of Savannah. The quotes cited below are only a few of many laudatory comments.

"The famous Oglethorpe plan for Savannah … made a unique use of the square in the design, nothing like it having appeared in a town plan before or since. Here, in Savannah, the square by frequent repetition becomes an integral part of the street pattern and creates a series of rhythmically placed openings which give a wonderful sense of space in a solidly built townscape." –[[Paul Zucker]]&lt;ref&gt;Zucker, Paul. ''Town and Square: From the Agora to the Village Green.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1959. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

"… a plan so exalted that it remains as one of the finest diagrams for city organization and growth in existence." –[[Edmund Bacon (architect)|Edmund Bacon]]&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, Edmund N. ''Design of Cities''. New York: Penguin Books, 1974. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[T]he grid pattern of Savannah . . . is like no other we know in its fineness and its distinguishable squares. . . . [O]nce seen it is unforgettable, and it carries over into real life experience."  --[[Allan Jacobs]]&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Allan B. ''Great Streets''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993. 255-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Savannah occupies a unique position in the history of city planning. No complete precedents exist for its pattern of multiple open spaces…."—John W. Reps&lt;ref&gt;Reps, John W. "C2 + L2 S2? Another Look at the Origins of Savannah’s Town Plan." ''In Forty Years of Diversity: Essays on Colonial Georgia'', edited by Harvey H. Jackson and Phinizy Spalding, 101-51. Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such comments nearly always apply to the ward layout found in the [[Savannah Historic District (Savannah, Georgia)|Savannah historic district]], where the city preserved and elaborated on the original town plan laid out by Oglethorpe. Though seldom mentioned, notable vestiges of the Oglethorpe Plan can be found in the land use pattern surrounding Savannah; in the cities of [[Darien, Georgia]]; [[Brunswick, Georgia]]; and at [[Fort Frederica National Monument]] on St. Simons Island, Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Oglethorpe Plan'', 153-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==
[[File:Savannah cityplan 1818.jpg|thumb|alt=1818 map of Savannah|Savannah map of 1818 showing continuation of the ward design with minor modifications]]

Oglethorpe developed a town plan in which the basic design unit was the ward. Wards were composed of four tything (residential) blocks and four trust (civic) blocks, arrayed around a central square. The tything blocks contained ten houses, which was the basic organizational unit for administration, farming, and defense. Each tything was assigned a square mile tract outside town for farming, with each family farming a forty-five acre plot within that tract. The tything trained together for militia duty, a necessity on the frontier. Families were also assigned five-acre kitchen gardens near town.

Oglethorpe’s town plan was initially developed for Savannah, which grew largely in accordance with the original design. The same basic plan was intended for replication in towns throughout the colony; however, the original design survives in few towns. Recently, Brunswick, Georgia, adopted a version of the design modeled after the [[Trustee Georgia|Trustee period]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Oglethorpe Plan'', 153-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Savannah, Georgia|City of Savannah]] has preserved the ward design within its [[Savannah Historic District (Savannah, Georgia)|National Historic Landmark District]]. Oglethorpe originally laid out six wards in Savannah. The design proved remarkably adaptable as the city grew, and city officials perpetuated the same basic model for more than a century. Ultimately, twenty-four wards were laid out in general accordance with the original design, filling most of the original square-mile town common.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''The Oglethorpe Plan'', 134-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city’s modern street grid outside of the historic district follows much of the original system of rights-of-way established under the Oglethorpe Plan for the gardens, farms, and villages that made up the Savannah region.

==Legacy==

===Relevance of the plan today===
Many of the principles found in the Oglethorpe Plan are as relevant today as the democratic principles articulated at the dawn of the American Revolution. Urban theorists have duly acknowledged Oglethorpe’s remarkable design legacy in Savannah, but most have said little about the plan’s larger purpose of fostering social equity. Urban planners and designers in Savannah have rediscovered Oglethorpe’s principles of integrated town planning, incorporating them in the city’s comprehensive plan and various implementing ordinances. The city’s success in doing so now stands as a model inviting wider application.&lt;ref&gt;''Tricentennial Plan'', "Community Agenda."&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan is fundamentally different from modern town or community plans by allowing for growth in small, interlocking units, or wards, of approximately 10 acres (4 hectares). The exact size of a ward will vary depending on the width of streets that bound it. In Savannah, streets between wards vary from 45 feet to 120 feet, including sidewalks and landscaped medians. While the size of a ward may vary, it is important to keep it within about 15 percent of Oglethorpe’s original layout. In following this standard automobile traffic is naturally limited to speeds of about 20&amp;nbsp;mph (30 kph), the threshold for pedestrian comfort in a mixed-modal, shared space environment.

Another way in which the plan is fundamentally different from most designs today is in maximizing lot coverage on buildable lots while minimizing the open space requirement on those lots. Minimizing or eliminating these standards can be done because open space is provided in the public realm. A ward contains approximately 50% developable area and 50% public area (depending on the width of bounding streets), and because the public area is shared space streets contribute to open space both aesthetically and functionally.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas and Patrick Shay. "Oglethorpe and Savannah: A Historic Plan has Modern Applications." ''Planning''. March, 2014, 30-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence in contemporary planning===
The Savannah town plan has been praised profusely, as mentioned earlier, but no recent or contemporary replicas of it exist either in infill or suburban developments, even in Savannah's own districts that lie beyond the original square mile commons.  Its cellular ward system has been cited as a unique example of fractal, or "organic", city growth in which each ward cell is a microcosm of the entire city.&lt;ref&gt;Batty, Michael; Longley, Paul (1994). Fractal Cities: A Geometry of Form and Function, Academic Press; {{ISBN|0124555705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its recognized and praised advantages have recently been incorporated in a planning model, which is also cellular, that shows the influence of the Oglethorpe plan – the [[Fused Grid]].  Diagrammatic and approved plans, based on this model reflect the Savannah plan principle of organizing buildable space around open space. In this reformulated expression of it, which accommodates contemporary planning, technological and cultural priorities, Oglethorpe’s Town Plan could find a renewed appreciation and wider replication.

'''Oleosins''' are structural [[protein]]s found in vascular plant [[oil body|oil bodies]] and in plant cells. Oil bodies are not considered organelles because they have a single layer membrane and lack the pre-requisite double layer membrane in order to be considered an organelle.  They are found in plant parts with high [[oil]] content that undergo extreme [[desiccation#Biology and ecology|desiccation]] as part of their maturation process, and help stabilize the bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hsieh |first=Kai |author2=Anthony H.C. Huang| title= Lipid-rich tapetosomes in ''Brassica'' tapetum are composed of oleosin-coated oil droplets and vesicles, both assembled in and then detached from the endoplasmic reticulum|journal=The Plant Journal| volume=43|date=September 2005| issue=6| pages=889–99|pmid=16146527|doi=10.1111/j.1365-313X.2005.02502.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oleosins are [[protein]]s of 16 [[Kilodalton|kDa]] to 24 kDa and are composed of three [[protein domain|domains]]: an [[N-terminal]] [[hydrophilic]] region of variable length (from 30 to 60 residues); a central [[hydrophobic]] [[Domain (biology)|domain]] of about 70 [[Residue (chemistry)|residue]]s and a C-terminal [[amphipathic]] region of variable length (from 60 to 100 residues). The central hydrophobic domain is proposed to be made up of beta-strand [[secondary structure|structure]] and to [[Protein-protein interaction|interact]] with the [[lipids]]. It is the only domain whose sequence is [[conserved sequence|conserved]].&lt;ref name="pmid1639802"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tzen JT, Lie GC, Huang AH | title = Characterization of the charged components and their topology on the surface of plant seed oil bodies | journal = J.

Oleosins have been found on oil bodies of seeds, [[tapetum (botany)|tapetum]] cells, and [[pollen]] but not [[fruit]]s. Instead of a stabilizer of oil bodies, oleosins are believed to be involved in water-uptaking of pollen on stigma.

==Use in Purification of Recombinant Protein==
Oleosins provide an easy way of purifying proteins which have been produced [[Recombinant DNA|recombinantly]] in plants.  If the protein is made as a [[fusion protein]] with oleosin and a [[protease]] recognition site is incorporated between them, the fusion protein will sit in the membrane of the oil body, which can be easily isolated by [[centrifugation]].  The oil droplets can then be mixed with [[aqueous]] medium again, and oleosin cleaved from the protein of interest.  Centrifugation will cause two phases to separate again, and the aqueous medium now contains the purified protein.

'''Population [[geography]]''' is a division of [[human geography]]. It is the study of the ways in which spatial variations in the distribution, composition, migration, and growth of populations are related to the nature of places. Population geography involves [[demography]] in a geographical perspective.{{efn|While population geography focuses on the impacts of population on ''spatial'' structures and processes, geodemography analyzes the effects of space on ''demographic'' structures and processes. However, the boundary between population geography and demography is becoming more and more blurred.}} It focuses on the characteristics of population distributions that change in a spatial context. This often involves factors such as where populations are found and how the size and composition of these populations is regulated by the demographic processes of [[fertility]], [[Mortality rate|mortality]], and [[Human migration|migration]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Castree, N., Kitchin, Rogers|title=population geography. In A Dictionary of Human Geography.|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199599868.001.0001/acref-9780199599868-e-1426|website=Penn State Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contributions to population geography are cross-disciplinary because geographical epistemologies related to environment, place and space have been developed at various times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gresh A. &amp; Maharaj P.|title=Policy and Programme Responses|url=https://link-springer-com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-8357-2_11#citeas|website=Penn State Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related disciplines include geography, demography, [[sociology]], and [[economics]].

Since its inception, population geography has taken at least three distinct but related forms, the most recent of which appears increasingly integrated with human geography in general. The earliest and most enduring form of population geography emerged in the 1950s, as part of [[spatial science]]. Pioneered by Glenn Trewartha, Wilbur Zelinsky, William A. V. Clark, and others in the United States, as well as Jacqueline Beujeau-Garnier and Pierre George in France, it focused on the systematic study of the distribution of population as a whole and the spatial variation in population characteristics such as fertility and mortality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Population geography defined itself as the systematic study of:

# the simple description of the location of population numbers and characteristics

# the explanation of the spatial configuration of these numbers and characteristics

# the geographic analysis of population phenomena (the inter-relations among real differences in population with those in all or certain other elements within the geographic study area).

Accordingly, it categorized populations as groups synonymous with political jurisdictions representing gender, religion, age, disability, generation, sexuality, and race, variables which go beyond the vital statistics of births, deaths, and marriages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Given the rapidly growing global population as well as the baby boom in affluent countries such as the United States, these geographers studied the relation between demographic growth, displacement, and access to resources at an international scale.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Examples can be shown through population density maps. A few types of maps that show the spatial layout of population are [[choropleth]], [[Contour line|isoline]], and dot maps.

{{tone|section|date=August 2018}}

===Suburbanization===

[[Suburbanization]] in the developed part of [[North America]] has roots in the migration decisions of many families who leave central cities and relocate on the [[urban area|urban]] fringe. This type of metropolitan decentralization matters because it contributes to the pressures on [[rural area|rural]] and "green-field" land, the under-funding of inner-city schools, the continuing segregation of groups in society, and the difficulties some suburban housewives encounter in finding jobs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bailey, A. (2014). ''Making population geography''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://sk8es4mc2l.search.serialssolutions.com/?sid=sersol&amp;SS_jc=TC0000422501&amp;title=Making%20population%20geography&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel and Palestine===

When the political creation of [[Israel]] was brokered in 1948, the act of drawing boundaries created new populations and divided others. Specifically, the displacement of thousands of residents of the former [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and the wholesale destruction of over 500 Arab villages created a [[refugee]] population that is, today, the world’s largest (over 4 million) and longest-lasting, including over two generations.{{cn|date=August 2018}} Palestinian refugee communities lack access to human rights, protection, territorially rooted homelands and land that can support reasonable livelihoods. Refugee populations are some of the world’s poorest, most insecure, most fragile, and most dependent communities. While poverty and endemic insecurity characterize Palestinian refugees, the state of Israel is both threatened by the co-presence of this refugee community and complicit/active in its maintenance, through acts purported as securing the state.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Tuberculosis in immigrants===

[[Tuberculosis]] (TB) was a leading cause of death among young men and women in many North American cities at the turn of the 20th century. Medical discoveries about the spread of the disease and childhood vaccinations helped to decrease TB infections and case mortality rates declined steadily during the century. However, by the early 1990s, figures by place of birth suggested that foreign-born persons were eight times more likely to die from TB than native-born Americans.{{cn|date=August 2018}} By studying the geographic context of disease, it becomes apparent that TB is less a marker of immigration than it is of poverty. Increasing TB levels in parts of the former [[Soviet Union]] territories and [[Haiti]] suggest that unemployment, poor access to underfunded healthcare systems, and stress all elevate risk. Immigrants also do not seem to be bringing TB to the United States but instead developing TB once inside the country. Concentrations of TB among immigrants in non-traditional destination states may suggest poor agricultural working conditions, barriers to accessing healthcare, and concentrations of refugee groups in unhealthy areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Africa’s baby boom===

[[Africa]] has now become the fastest-growing and fastest-urbanizing continent. Africa's population is estimated to reach two billion by 2050. As countries get richer, they experience a demographic transition. Africa's people are its biggest asset; one day, its workforce could be as robust and dynamic as Asia's. But there is nothing inevitable about the ability to cash in the demographic dividend. For that to happen, Africa will have to choose the right policies and overcome its many problems.&lt;ref&gt;The Baby Bonanza; Africa's Population. (2009, Aug 29). ''The Economist, 392'', 21-24. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/login?url=https://search-proquest-com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/docview/223965384?accountid=13158&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global population aging===

The traditional [[United Nations]] definition of retirees is defined as age 65.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The population aging that is presently occurring is unprecedented. Over the next decade, the number of people aged 60 years and over is expected to rise substantially, and most of the increase will occur in developing countries. Globally, the number of older persons is expected to exceed the number of children in 2045 for the first time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;(2011), Department of Economic and Social Affairs; ''World Population Ageing 2009''. Population and Development Review, 37: 403. doi:10.1111/j.1728-4457.2011.00421.x&lt;nowiki&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2011.00421.x/abstract&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapidly aging population is likely to have far-reaching effects. Economically, population aging affects growth, savings, investments, consumption, labor markets, social security systems, taxation, and inter-generational transfers. Socially, it influences family structures, housing demands, migration trends, and the epidemiology of diseases and the need for healthcare service. Politically, it shapes voting patterns and representation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Population aging has received considerable attention in developed countries, but only in the past few decades has awareness of the ramifications of a rapidly aging population grown in the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Gresh A., Maharaj P. (2013) Policy and Programme Responses. In: Maharaj P. (eds) Aging and Health in Africa. International Perspectives on Aging, vol 4. Springer, Boston, MA. &lt;nowiki&gt;https://link-springer-com.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-8357-2_11#citeas&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* The way in which places in turn react to population phenomena, e.g. [[immigration]]

Research topics of other geographic sub-disciplines, such as [[settlement geography]], also have a population geography dimension:

* The grouping of people within settlements
* The way from the geographical character of places, e.g. settlement patterns

All of the above are looked at over space and time. Population geography also studies the relationships between man and his environment, including problems from those relationships, such as [[overpopulation]], pollution, and others.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4579">'''Regulatory mode theory''', along with [[regulatory focus theory]] was developed by [[E. Tory Higgins]] and [[Arie Kruglanski]] who are interested in the development of goal-pursuit as well as motivation. The theory depicts two main approaches to situations using locomotion and assessment.

==Background==

The '''regulatory mode theory''' depicts how people approach situations to achieve the goal. This theory is part of [[E. Tory Higgins]] research in motivation theories and goal pursuit theories.  People can either use the locomotion or the assessment method for goal-pursuit. [[E. Tory Higgins]] states, "When people self-regulate they decide what they want that they don’t currently have. They then figure out what they need to do to get what they want, and then they do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Higgins|first=Tory|title=Beyond Pleasure and Pain: How Motivation Works|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People who are geared towards the locomotion mode are focused on moving and getting things done. In contrast, those that are strong in assessment will compare different goals and analyze different options.

==Locomotion and assessment==

A study done by Pierro, Giacomantonio, Pica, Kruglanski, and Higgins (2011) examined the ways locomotion and assessment affects procrastination and how people manage time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pierro|first=Antonio|author2=Giacomantonio, Mauro |author3=Pica, Gennaro |author4=Kruglanski, Arie W. |author5= Higgins, E. Tory |title=On the psychology of time in action: Regulatory mode orientations and procrastination.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 2011|volume=101|issue=6|pages=1317–1331|doi=10.1037/a0025943 |pmid=22103579}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that assessment is positively related to procrastination and locomotion is negatively related to procrastination. To reach a certain goal, assessors have to analyze and compare a large amount of work. However, the locomotors were generally quicker to make decisions and act on them. The study emphasized that assessment orientation evaluates and analyzes in such detail that they delay making the decision quickly. Yet for the assessment-oriented individuals, they were more accurate in their decisions even though they took a longer time. These two regulatory modes reflect motivational styles for goal-pursuit. The motivation behind the assessment mode is accuracy and for locomotion mode it is action.

==Promoting value==
A person's regulatory mode is correlated with [[Regulatory focus theory|regulatory fitness]]. They display their optimal level of performance in addition to valuing the end goals. In Avnet and Higgin's study (2004), the participants paid more for the book-light when their decisions were based on their regulatory orientation—either locomotion or assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Avnet|first=Tamar|author2=Tory Higgins, E|title=Locomotion, assessment, and regulatory fit: Value transfer from "how" to "what"|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=1 September 2003|volume=39|issue=5|pages=525–530|doi=10.1016/S0022-1031(03)00027-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They demonstrated that the value of the book-light is dependent on their approach systems.

==Motivation==
Consequently, locomotion can be very efficient in maintaining attitude, creating intention, and facilitating behavior. Mannetti, Pierro, Higgins, and Kruglanski (2012) investigated peoples' commitment to exercising at the gym and how regularly they went.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mannetti|first=Lucia|author2=Pierro, Antonio |author3=Higgins, E. Tory |author4= Kruglanski, Arie W. |title=Maintaining Physical Exercise: How Locomotion Mode Moderates the Full Attitude–Intention–Behavior Relation|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|date=1 July 2012|volume=34|issue=4|pages=295–303|doi=10.1080/01973533.2012.693442}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They evaluated the participants' regulatory mode using a questionnaire and then their attendance was recorded in a 6-month period. Results show that when the people had high locomotion concerns and they had positive attitudes about physical exercise, their intentions to engage in physical exercise were high. They would proceed to actually engage in physical exercise within the 6-month period. Since locomotion runs on the motivation to do and to act, the positive effects of making a behavior happen can be expanded to other areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2168">[[Image:Cambridge Thermo Galvanometer 1905.jpg|thumb|Thermo Galvanometer made by Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company Ltd.]]
The '''thermo-galvanometer''' is an instrument for measuring small electric currents. It was invented by [[William Duddell]] about 1900. The following is a description of the instrument taken from  a trade catalog of [[Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company]] dated 1905: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For a long time the need of an instrument capable of accurately measuring small alternating currents has been keenly felt. The high resistance and self-induction of the coils of instruments of the electro-magnetic type frequently prevent their use. Electro-static instruments as at present constructed are not altogether suitable for measuring very small currents, unless a sufficient potential difference is available.

The thermo-galvanometer designed by Mr W. Duddell can be used for the measurement of extremely small currents to a high degree of accuracy. It has practically no self-induction or capacity and can therefore be used on a circuit of any frequency (even up to 120,000~ per sec.) and currents as small as twenty micro-amperes can be readily measured by it . It is equally correct on continuous and alternating currents. It can therefore be accurately standardized by continuous current and used without error on circuits of any frequency or wave-form.

The principle of the thermo-galvanometer is simple. The instrument consists of a resistance which is heated by the current to be measured, the heat from the resistance falling on the thermo-junction of a Boys radio-micrometer. The rise in temperature of the lower junction of the thermo-couple produces a current in the loop which is deflected by the magnetic field against the torsion of the quartz fibre.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Touchet River''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|uː|ʃ|i}} is a {{convert|55|mi|km|adj=on}} tributary of the [[Walla Walla River]] in southeastern [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in the [[United States]].

The upper Touchet was a traditional summer meeting place for trade and games for the [[Palus (tribe)|Palus]], [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]] and [[Walla Walla (tribe)|Walla Walla]] tribes. The name Touchet derives from the similarly pronounced [[Sahaptin language|Sahaptin]] term for the river, ''Tu-se'' meaning roasting. Nez Perce legend tells that coyote roasted [[salmon]] at this river after breaking a fish dam guarded by the seven swallow sisters at [[Celilo Falls|Celilo]].

The [[USGS]] cited two variant names, Pouchet River and Toosha River.&lt;ref name="gnis"/&gt;

==Geography==
The Touchet River drains an area of about {{convert|740|sqmi|km2}}.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cohen, Saul B. Editor |title=Gazetteer of the Word |publisher=Columbia University Press, New York|year=1962|isbn=0-231-11040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A"&gt;Washington Road &amp; Recreation Atlas, Benchmark Maps, Medford, Oregon, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The [[main stem]] is {{convert|55|mi|km}} long.&lt;ref name="topo map"/&gt; The average annual flow of the Touchet is 6.23 m³/s (220&amp;nbsp;ft³/s), not including diversions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eho.wa.gov/searchdocuments/1995%20Archive/pchb%2094-192%20final.htm Records of the POLLUTION CONTROL HEARINGS BOARD, State of Washington] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603150737/http://www.eho.wa.gov/searchdocuments/1995%20Archive/pchb%2094-192%20final.htm |date=2007-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its headwaters lie in the [[Umatilla National Forest]] which is located in the [[Blue Mountains (Oregon)|Blue Mountains]] in [[Columbia County, Washington|Columbia County]], southern Washington. It originates above the town of [[Dayton, Washington]].  It then passes through [[Waitsburg]] and [[Prescott, Washington|Prescott]] before joining the Walla Walla at the town of [[Touchet, Washington]].&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

The main Touchet River is formed by the confluence of the North Fork of the Touchet which originates in the vicinity of the [[Bluewood Ski Area]], and the South Fork of the Touchet which originates at Deadman Peak. The forks join about {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} south of (upstream of) Dayton. The North Fork is about {{convert|25|mi|km}} long and the South Fork about {{convert|20|mi|km}} long. Other tributaries include Patit Creek, which joins the Touchet at Dayton; Coppei Creek, which enters at Waitsburg, and Whetstone Creek, which joins the Touchet at Prescott.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;

==Recreation==
The Touchet is known for its trout fishing, especially in the upper reaches.

Although  summer [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]], which like [[salmon]] are [[anadromous]], and [[Chinook salmon]] spawned throughout a large portion of the middle and upper reaches of the Touchet River drainage, the population is virtually nonexistent in the 21st century. The Nine Mile Dam, constructed in 1905 on the Walla Walla River below the confluence with the Touchet River, ended anadromous fish migration into the Touchet.

==History==

===Native peoples===
[[Image:Touchet at Lemar looking East.JPG|thumb|upright|Touchet River Valley in the fall, slightly west of Lamar Cabin.]] 
The Touchet River lay in the traditional range of the [[Palus (tribe)|Palus American Indian tribe]], marking their southern border with the range of the [[Walla Walla (tribe)|Walla Walla tribe]]. These peoples were of the [[Sahaptin language|Sahaptin]]-speaking group which traditionally inhabited the [[Columbia Plateau]] region of the northwestern United States.

Roots provided plentiful food along the Touchet Rivers.  These included [[quamash]], [[Camassia|camas]], [[kouse]], [[bitterroot]]s, [[serviceberry]] (currant), [[chokecherry]], [[huckleberry]], [[gooseberries]], rose berries and [[whortleberries]], elderberries, wild [[Strawberry|strawberries]], [[wild onion]]s and [[Balsamorhiza|balsamroot]].  Once Euroamerican immigrants began settling the area after 1858, Indian root grounds were displaced by agriculture.

Prior to the white man coming into the valley of the Touchet River, there was an established American Indian trail through the valley, the ''Nez Perce Trail to Celilo Falls'' or ''Old Celilo Falls Trail'', by which the Nez Perce (also part of the Sahaptin-speaking group) passed west to fish for salmon at [[Celilo Falls]] on the [[Columbia River]]. As with other Sahaptin-speaking peoples, the Nez Perce were migratory, returning to the same locations year after year; Celilo Falls lay at the western end of their annual range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Trafzer, C.E.  |author2=Scheuerman, R.D.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Renegade Tribe; The Palouse Indians and the Invasion of the Inland Pacific Northwest|publisher=Washington State University Press, Pullman, Washington|year=1986|isbn=0-87422-027-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lewis and Clark expedition===
On their return journey in 1806, the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] followed the ''Old Celilo Falls Trail'', up the Walla Walla and Touchet River Valleys; they camped on the Touchet about {{convert|12|mi|km}} north of today's town of Touchet on April 30, 1806.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/LivingWith/Historical/LewisClark/volcanoes_lewis_clark_april_30_1806.html Lewis &amp; Clark on April 30, 1806]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lewis and Clark Trail State Park commemorates their May 1, 1806 campsite on the Touchet River.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.parks.wa.gov/parkpage.asp?selectedpark=Lewis%20%26%20Clark%20Trail |title=Lewis &amp; Clark Trail campsite on the Touchet River |access-date=2006-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923012759/http://www.parks.wa.gov/parkpage.asp?selectedpark=Lewis%20%26%20Clark%20Trail |archive-date=2006-09-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition left the Touchet River to follow a tributary, Patit Creek, at what is now Dayton. They camped about {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} above modern-day Dayton on Patit Creek on May 2, 1806, before following the trail across country to the [[Tucannon River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moulton, Gary E. |title=The Journals of the Lewis &amp; Clark Expedition: March&amp;nbsp;23 &amp;ndash; June&amp;nbsp;9, 1806 |publisher= University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, Nebraska |year=1991|isbn=0-8032-2898-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early settlement===
The Whitman Mission catalyzed white settlement of the region, beginning in 1843 when 1,000 people, 120 wagons, and approximately 5,000 horses and cattle came to the Walla Walla valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Evans, J. W. |title=Powerful Rockey: The Blue Mountains and the Oregon Trail, 1811-1883|publisher=Eastern Oregon State College, La Grande, Oregon,|year=1991|isbn=0-9626772-0-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The initial settlers remained near the current city of Walla Walla and into the Touchet River valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lyman, W. D. |title=Lyman's History of Old Walla Walla County, Embracing Walla Walla, Columbia, Garfield and Asotin Counties.|publisher=S. J. Clarke, Chicago|year=1918|id=ISBN none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later settlement===
[[Image:Lemar Cabin 2.JPG|thumb|right|Lamar Cabin]]
The Lamar Cabin, built in 1863 of hand-hewn cottonwood logs from the Touchet River valley by George Dudley Goodwin, became the home of the bachelor brothers James and Joseph Lamar in 1872 (women were rare in the valley and many men remained unmarried). The brothers initially raised sheep and horses; in later years they, mirroring the transitions of many others in the region, cultivated dryland [[winter wheat]]. This area developed into the town of Lamar when the Hunt Railroad was built along the Touchet River valley in 1888. The railway left the Touchet River and continued west at Lamar at the point where the Touchet River turns south to meet the Walla Walla. Although the town site is now virtually abandoned, the historic Lamar cabin is preserved to this day (see photo).

Near the head of the Touchet valley, Dayton was officially incorporated on November 10, 1881.

[[File:ToK Simple.jpg|thumb|379px|Gregg Henriques' Tree of Knowledge System]]

The '''tree of knowledge''' ('''ToK''') '''system''' is a theoretical approach to the unification of [[psychology]] developed by [[Gregg Henriques]], associate professor and director of the Combined-Integrated Doctoral Program in Clinical and School Psychology at [[James Madison University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/about%20me.htm "About Me" section of the ToK System website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The outline of the system was published in 2003 in ''[[Review of General Psychology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt; Two special issues of the ''[[Journal of Clinical Psychology]]'' in December 2004&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jissue/109747885 ''Journal of Clinical Psychology''. (December 2004). Special Issue: Defining Psychology: Articles and Commentaries on a New Unified Theory (Part 1) Issue Edited by Gregg R. Henriques. Volume 60 Issue 12, Pages 1203 – 1315]&lt;/ref&gt; and January 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/jissue/109856879 ''Journal of Clinical Psychology''. (January 2005). Special Issue: Defining Psychology: Articles and Commentaries on a New Unified Theory (Part 2) Issue Edited by Gregg R. Henriques. Volume 61 Issue 1, Pages 1 – 139 ]&lt;/ref&gt; were devoted to the elaboration and evaluation of the model. The latest evaluation of this model appeared in a December 2008 special issue of ''[[Theory &amp; Psychology']]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap.sagepub.com/content/vol18/issue6/ ''Theory &amp; Psychology''. (December 2008). Volume 18, No. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

The official website on the tree of knowledge system claims that the ToK is

:''a new unified theory of knowledge that maps the pieces of the scientific puzzle in a novel way that connects Quantum Mechanics to Sociological processes and everything in between into a coherent whole. The most novel aspect of the ToK is its visuo-spatial depiction of knowledge as consisting of four dimensions of complexity (Matter, Life, Mind, and Culture) that correspond to the behavior of four classes of objects (material objects, organisms, animals, and humans), and four classes of science (physical, biological, psychological, and social).''&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/other%20research.htm ToK FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "problem of psychology"==
Henriques argues that the most difficult problem in psychology as a discipline is that while there is incredible diversity offered by different approaches to psychology, there is no consensus model of what ''psychology'' actually is.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The tree of knowledge system and the theoretical unification of psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/Psych%20Defined.pdf Psychology Defined]. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1207–1221.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
According to the ToK system, the "problem of psychology", (as Henriques puts it), is that a clear definition, an agreed upon subject matter, and a coherent conceptual framework have eluded its students for its entire [[history of psychology|history]]. He further argues that the patent tendency of psychology has been toward theoretical and substantial fragmentation and increasing insularity among the "specialties." In other words, the discipline has fragmented into [[psychological schools|different schools of thought]] and methodology, with no overall framework to interpret and integrate the research of different areas. At its best, the different approaches are a strength of psychology; different approaches lead to novel ideas, and prevent psychologists from clinging to a paradigm that fails to explain a phenomenon. At its worst, adherents of one particular school cling to their beliefs concerning the relative importance of their research and disregard or are ignorant of different approaches. In most cases, individual psychologists have to determine for themselves which elements of which perspective to apply, and how to integrate them into their overall understanding.
 
The reason for psychology's fragmentation, according to the ToK, is that there has been no [[metatheory|meta-theoretical]] frame that allows scholars to agree on the basic questions that need to be addressed. As such, the different schools of thought in psychology are like the blind men who each grab a part of the elephant and proclaim they have discovered its true nature. With its novel depiction of evolving dimensions of complexity, the ToK allows scholars finally to see the elephant. In his 2003 ''Review of General Psychology'' paper,&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The tree of knowledge system and the theoretical unification of psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt; Henriques used the ToK System with the attempt to clarify and align the views of [[B.F. Skinner]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. These luminaries were chosen because when one considers their influence and historical opposition, it can readily be argued that they represent two schools of thought that are the most difficult to integrate. Henriques used the meta-perspective offered by the ToK to argue how one can retain the key insights from each school of thought, identify errors and points of confusion, and integrate the insights into a coherent whole.

Cultural and personality psychologist, Michael Katzko,&lt;ref&gt;[http://baserv.uci.kun.nl/~mwsk49/ Homepage of Michael Katzko]&lt;/ref&gt; however critiques Henriques' position on "the problem of psychology":

:''There is a very good reason for skepticism regarding the repeated claims that the one unique problem of psychology, applicable across the entire discipline, has been identified and that the ToK System solves it. The reason is given by the detail with which alternatives have been worked out, be they historical studies of institutional development or critical commentaries on the rhetorical structure of psychology's literature.''&lt;ref&gt;Katzko, M.W. (2008). Pruning the Tree of Knowledge. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 817–828. [http://tap.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/18/6/817 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tree of knowledge==
In one way, the tree of knowledge system reflects a fairly common hierarchy of nature and of the sciences that has been represented in one way or another since the time of [[Auguste Comte]], who in the 19th century used a hierarchical conception of nature to argue for the existence of sociology. Despite its surface agreement with a standard conception, the ToK System offers a set of ideas that have added implications for both [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]]. The ontological claim made by the ToK, (and [[#top|depicted pictorially above]]), is that [[Physical cosmology|cosmic evolution]] consists of four separable dimensions of complexity, namely [[matter]], life, [[mind]], and culture. The dimension of complexity argument is arguably one of the most complicated aspects of the system. Many have argued nature is hierarchically leveled; for example, a list of such levels might be [[subatomic particles]], [[atoms]], [[molecule]]s, [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, organ structures, multi-celled organisms, [[consciousness]], and society is common. The ToK System embraces a view of nature as levels, but adds the notion that there are also ''dimensions of complexity''. The difference can be seen pictorially. A view of nature as solely consisting of levels would have a single "cone" of complexity, whereas the ToK depicts four "cones". The ToK posits that a separate dimension of complexity emerges when a process of selection operates on a unit of information. Thus, according to the ToK, [[natural selection]] operating on genetic combinations gives rise to the dimension of Life; [[Radical behaviorism|behavioral selection]] operating on [[neuron]]al combinations gives rise to the dimension of Mind; and [[theory of justification|justification]] operating on [[symbol]]ic combinations gives rise to Culture.

The ToK system also offers a new epistemology that Henriques believes will move toward what [[E.O. Wilson]] termed ''[[consilience]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.O. (1999). ''[[Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]]''. Vintage:USA&lt;/ref&gt; Consilience is the interlocking of fact and theory into a coherent, holistic view of knowledge. The ToK offers alternative perspectives on how knowledge is obtained because it depicts science itself as both emerging out of culture and as a unique type of "justification system" that is based on the values of [[accuracy]] and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2008). The problem of psychology and the integration of human knowledge: Contrasting Wilson's Consilience with the ToK system. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 731–755. [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/PPIHPRevised.pdf Final draft]&lt;/ref&gt; A "justification system", according to Henriques, refers to any belief system that emerges that coordinates the behaviors of individual humans to human populations. The four dimensions of complexity correspond to four broad classes of science: the [[physical science|physical]], [[biology|biological]], [[psychology|psychological]] and [[social science]]s.

===Matter===

The dimension of [[matter]] refers to the set of material objects and their behaviors through time. In accordance with modern [[cosmology]], matter is theorized to have emerged from a pure energy [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] at the [[Big Bang]]. [[Space-time|Space and time]] were also born at such a point. Nonliving material objects range in complexity from [[subatomic particle]]s to large organic molecules. The physical sciences (i.e., [[physics]], [[chemistry]], geology, [[astronomy]]) describe the behavior of material objects.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life===

The dimension of life refers to [[organism]]s and their behaviors through time. Living objects are considered a unique subset of material objects. Just as [[quantum particle]]s form the fundamental units of material complexity, [[gene]]s are the fundamental units of living information. Although many questions about the emergence of life remain unanswered, in accordance with modern biology, the ToK posits that natural selection operating on genetic combinations through time is the unified theory of biology and forms the foundational understanding for the emergence of organic complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mind===

Mind/cognition in the ToK system refers to the set of mental behaviors. ''Mental behaviors'' are behaviors of animals mediated by the [[nervous system]] that produce a functional effect on the animal-environment relationship. As such, Mind/cognition is essentially synonymous with what behavioral psychologists have meant when they use the term behavior. Thus, a fly avoiding a fly swatter, a rat pushing a bar or a human getting a drink of water are all mental behaviors. Mind is not synonymous with [[sentience]] or the capacity for mental experience, although such processes are presumed to emerge in the mental/cognitive dimension. [[Cognition]], in the broad sense of the term is meaning bodily-neuro-social information processing, as in EEEE Cognition: Embodied, Embedded, Enactive, Extended. While cognitive science stands for naturalist study of mind, psychology is an approach grounded in the tradition of humanities, especially philosophy. Thus, by defining mind as mental behavior, Henriques argues that the ToK System provides a way to bridge the epistemological differences between [[cognitive science|cognitive]] and [[behaviorism|behavioral science]].&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===

Culture in the ToK system refers to the set of [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] behaviors, which range from large scale nation states to individual human justifications for particular actions. Just as genetic information processing is associated with the Life dimension and neuronal information processing associated with the Mind dimension, symbolic information processing emerges with the Cultural dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2003). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/The%20ToK%20and%20Unification%20of%20Psych.pdf The Tree of Knowledge System and the Theoretical Unification of Psychology.] ''Review of General Psychology, 7,'' 150–182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical joint points==

===Quantum gravity===
{{main|Quantum gravity}}

'''Quantum gravity''' refers to the imagined merger between the twin pillars of physical science which are [[quantum mechanics]], the study of the microscopic (e.g., electrons), and [[general relativity]], the science of the macroscopic (e.g., [[galaxy|galaxies]]). Currently, these two great domains of science cannot be effectively interwoven into a single, physical [[Theory of Everything]]. Yet progress is being made, most notably through [[string theory]], [[loop quantum gravity]], [[black hole thermodynamics]] and the study of the early universe. Some of the difficulties combining these two pillars of physical science are philosophical in nature and it is possible that the macro view of knowledge offered by the ToK may eventually aid in the construction of a coherent theory of quantum gravity. The reason the ToK might help is that it locates scientific knowledge in relationship to the physical universe.

===The modern synthesis===
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)|l1=The Modern Synthesis}}

The '''modern synthesis''' refers to the merger of genetics with [[natural selection]] which occurred in the 1930s and 1940s and offers a reasonably complete framework for understanding the emergence of biological complexity. Although there remain significant gaps in biological knowledge surrounding questions such as the origin of life and the emergence of sexual reproduction, the modern synthesis represents the most complete and well-substantiated joint point.

===Behavioral investment theory===

'''Behavioral investment theory''' ('''BIT''') is proposed as a merger of the selection science of [[behaviorism]] with the information science of [[cognitive neuroscience]] (notice the parallel with the modern synthesis). BIT posits that the nervous system evolved as an increasingly flexible computational control system that coordinates the behavioral expenditure of energy of the animal as a whole. Expenditure of behavioral energy is theorized to be computed on an investment value system built evolutionarily through natural selection operating on genetic combinations and [[ontogeny|ontogenetically]] through behavioral selection operating on neural combinations. As such, the current behavioral investments of the animal are conceptualized as the joint product of the two vectors of [[phylogeny]] and [[ontogeny]]. A unique element of BIT is that it finds a core of agreement and builds bridges between five brain-behavior paradigms: (1) [[cognitive science]]; (2) [[behavioral science]]; (3) evolutionary theory and genetics; (4) neuroscience; and (5) [[cybernetics]]/[[systems theory]].

[[David C. Geary]] noted the similarities between his "motive-to-control" hypothesis and Henriques' Behavioral Investment Theory, which were developed independently of each other. Furthermore, Geary suggested that his model "seem[ed] to fill in many of the [[proximate causation|proximate mechanisms]] and evolutionary pressures that define the life-mind joint point, and provided a framework for further development of the mind-culture joint point."&lt;ref&gt;Geary, D. C. (2005). [http://web.missouri.edu/~psycorie/JCP05%5Bfinal%5D05.pdf The motivation to control and the origin of mind: Exploring the life-mind joint point in the tree of knowledge.] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 61,'' 21–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justification hypothesis===

The '''justification hypothesis''' ('''JH''') is a novel proposal that allows for both the understanding of the evolution of culture and for identifying what makes humans distinct animals. A basic initial claim of the JH is that the process of justification is a crucial component of human mental behavior at both the individual and societal level. Unlike all other animals, humans everywhere ask for and give explanations for their actions. Arguments, debates, moral dictates, rationalizations, and excuses all involve the process of explaining why one's claims, thoughts or actions are warranted. In virtually every form of social exchange, from warfare to politics to family struggles to science, humans are constantly justifying their behavioral investments to themselves and others.

The JH can be stated succinctly as follows: The evolution of language gave rise to the problem of justification, and this evolutionary pressure ultimately resulted in the human self-consciousness system and human culture. The JH carries with it three fundamental postulates. 
*The first is that the evolution of language must have created the problem of justification, which is the problem of explaining one’s self to others in a justifiable manner.
*The second postulate is that the human self-consciousness system can be understood as a “justification filter”. This second claim links the evolutionary analysis with key insights from [[psychodynamic theory]]. Specifically, psychodynamic theory posits that socially unjustifiable impulses are inhibited and socially justifiable reasons are given for actions taken.
*The third postulate is that culture can be understood as large scale justification systems that coordinate the behavior of human populations. Cultural systems are seen to evolve much in the same way as organisms do in biological evolution: there is a process of variation, selection and retention of belief systems.

==How the ToK solves the problem of psychology==

The problem of psychology, according to the ToK, is its conceptual incoherence, which Henriques identifies by the following: 
:(1) There is no agreed upon definition.
:(2) There is no agreed upon subject matter.
:(3) There is a proliferation of overlapping and redundant concepts.
:(4) There are a large number of paradigms with fundamentally different epistemological assumptions.
:(5) Specialization continues to be increasingly emphasized at the expense of generalization and thus the problem of fragmentation only grows.

When the various conceptions of psychology (e.g., behavioral, humanistic, cognitive) are viewed through the lens of the ToK System, psychology spans two different dimensions of complexity: the mental and the cultural. In other words, the discipline has historically spanned two fundamentally separate problems: 
:(1) the problem of animal behavior in general, and
:(2) the problem of human behavior at the individual level.
 
If, as previously thought, nature simply consisted of levels of complexity, psychology would not be crisply defined in relationship to biology or the social sciences. And, indeed, it is frequently suggested that psychology exists in an amorphous space between biology and the social sciences. However, with its dimension of complexity depiction, the ToK System suggests that psychology can be crisply defined as the science of mind, which is the third dimension of complexity. Furthermore, because human behavior exists in the fourth dimension, psychology must be divided into two broad scientific domains of 
:(1) psychological formalism and
:(2) human psychology.

''Psychological formalism'' is defined as the science of mind and corresponds to the behavior of animal objects. ''Human psychology'' is considered to be a unique subset of psychological formalism that deals with human behavior at the level of the individual. Because human behavior is immersed in the larger socio-cultural context (level four in the ToK System), human psychology is considered a hybrid discipline that merges the pure science of psychology with the social sciences. It is important to point out that there are other disciplines the ToK System would classify as “hybrids.” Molecular genetics, for example, is a hybrid between chemistry and biology and neuroscience is a hybrid between biology and psychology. As with Henriques' proposed conception of human psychology, both of these disciplines adopt an object level perspective (molecular and cellular, respectively) on phenomena that simultaneously exist as part of meta-level system processes (life and mind, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/Psych%20Defined.pdf Psychology Defined]. ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1207–1221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though David A. F. Haaga "congratulate[d] Dr. Henriques' ambitious, scholarly, provocative paper", and "found the Tree of Knowledge taxonomy, the theoretical joint points, the evolutionary history, and the levels of emergent properties highly illuminating", he asks the rhetorical questions, 
:''If it is so difficult to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother? Why not just agree that we all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take the rest of the afternoon off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of some aspect of the world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.''&lt;ref&gt;Haaga, D.A.F. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/Related%20Articles/Defining%20Psychology.pdf Defining psychology: What can it do for us?] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1227–1230.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, Scott O. Lilienfeld, who described Henriques' effort as "thoughtful", contended that psychology is "an inherently fuzzy concept that resists precise definition" and that "attempts to define psychology [would be] likely to hamper rather than foster consilience across disciplines". Lilienfield went on further to suggest that the scientist-practitioner gap in psychology lies not in definitional issues, but in different "epistemic attitudes" between these two groups. He stated that scientists have an epistemic attitude of [[empiricism]], (where questions regarding human nature are settled by scientific evidence), and that practitioners have an epistemic attitude of [[romanticism]], (where questions of human nature are settled by intuition). Lilienfeld suggested that the solution to the scientist-practitioner gulf isn't definitional, but in "train[ing] future clinical scientists to appreciate the proper places of romanticism and empiricism within science".&lt;ref&gt;Lilienfeld, S.O. (2004). [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/Related%20Articles/Is%20it%20worth%20the%20trouble.pdf Defining psychology: Is it worth the trouble?] ''Journal of Clinical Psychology, 60,'' 1249–1253.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consciousness and human behavior==

A frequent question and point of confusion in the ToK System is the definition and meaning of [[consciousness]]. As mentioned above, mind is not synonymous with consciousness. And, to understand consciousness from a ToK vantage point, it is crucial to recognize that the term is often ambiguous in its meaning. Two primary meanings are [[sentience]], which is the capacity for mental experience and [[self-awareness]], which is the capacity to be aware of one's awareness. Sentience is conceptualized as a "level 3" phenomena, possessed by many animals other than humans and is defined as a "perceived" electro-neuro-chemical representation of animal-environment relations. The ingredient of neurological behavior that allows for the emergence of mental experience is considered the "hard" problem of conscious and the ToK System does not address this question explicitly. In contrast, through the Justification Hypothesis (see below), the ToK System involves a very direct analysis of the other issue of consciousness, that of [[self-awareness]]. 
 
Another frequent question that is raised is "Where does individual human behavior fall on the ToK?" To analyze human behavior from the context of the ToK, one uses the ToK like a prism to separate the dimensions of behavior into physiochemical, biogenetic, neuropsychological and sociolinguistic. Thus if we imagine a conversation between a husband and wife as follows:

:Wife: “You are late again.”
:Husband: “Please not now. It was a stressful day and traffic was bad and you know if work needs to be done, I can’t just leave it.”

The words represent the sociolinguistic dimension and are understood as a function of justification. Justification systems are seen both at the level of individual, micro-social and societal (i.e., the context of justification in which men work and women stay at home). The actions of the husband and wife in terms of [[facial expression]], body movement, etc. are seen as the mental dimension and are understood as a function of behavioral investment. The physiological make up of the organ systems and cells of each body is seen as the biogenetic dimension. Finally, the position, temperature, molecular make up is seen as the physiochemical dimension. Each of the more basic dimensions represent conditions of possibility that allow for the emergence of the higher dimension of process. Thus, insufficient oxygen disrupts organic processes which in turn renders neuropsychological and sociolinguistic processes impossible.

==Toward the integration of human knowledge==

As stated above, the ToK System proposes a new [[epistemology]] with the goal of moving academic knowledge toward what [[E.O. Wilson]] termed [[consilience]]. Consilience is the interlocking of fact and theory into a coherent, holistic view of knowledge. Henriques argues that the ToK affords new perspectives on how knowledge is obtained because it depicts how science emerges from culture and that the four dimensions of complexity correspond to four broad classes of science: the physical, biological, psychological and social sciences.

Henriques further argues that developing such a system for integrating knowledge is not just an academic enterprise. He suggests that in an increasingly complex world, the fragmented state of knowledge can be seen as one of the most pressing social problems of our time. Henriques also believes that history seems to attest that the absence of a collective worldview ostensibly condemns humanity to an endless series of conflicts that inevitably stem from incompatible, partially correct, locally situated justification systems. Thus, from Henriques' perspective, there are good reasons for believing that if there was a shared, general background of explanation, humanity might be able to achieve much greater levels of harmonious relations.
  
In a 2008 article on the ToK,&lt;ref&gt;Henriques, G.R. (2008). The problem of psychology and the integration of human knowledge: Contrasting Wilson's Consilience with the Tree of Knowledge System. ''Theory &amp; Psychology, 18,'' 731–755. [http://psychweb.cisat.jmu.edu/ToKSystem/My%20ToK%20Papers/PPIHPRevised.pdf Final draft]&lt;/ref&gt; Henriques cites [[Oliver Reiser]]'s 1958 call for unifying scientific knowledge that Henriques implies is similar in theme to the ToK:

::''In this time of divisive tendencies within and between the nations, races, religions, sciences and humanities, synthesis must become the great magnet which orients us all…[Yet] scientists have not done what is possible toward integrating bodies of knowledge created by science into a unified interpretation of man, his place in nature, and his potentialities for creating the good society. Instead, they are entombing us in dark and meaningless catacombs of learning.''&lt;ref&gt;Reiser, O.L. (1958). The integration of human knowledge. Boston: Porter Sargent.&lt;/ref&gt;

With its depiction of the dimensions of complexity and interlocking theoretical joint points, Henriques' believes that his  ToK System offers new avenues that might allow scholars to meet Reiser’s call for academic synthesis. Henriques, like Reiser, believes that with a shared sense of purpose and a common background of explanation, people might yet be able to integrate bodies of knowledge into a unified interpretation of humanity, with humanity's place in nature and its potentialities for creating the good society.

'''Udacity, Inc.''' is a for-profit educational organization founded by [[Sebastian Thrun]], [[David Stavens]], and Mike Sokolsky offering [[massive open online course]]s (MOOCs).&lt;ref name='npr'&gt;{{cite news |title= Stanford Takes Online Schooling To The Next Academic Level |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2012/01/23/145645472/stanford-takes-online-schooling-to-the-next-academic-level | newspaper= All Things Considered, National Public Radio |date= 23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Thrun, the origin of the name Udacity comes from the company's desire to be "audacious for you, the student".&lt;ref name="udacity origin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thrun|first=Sebastian|title=Sebastian Thrun's Homepage|url=http://robots.stanford.edu|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anders&gt;

Udacity is the outgrowth of free computer science classes offered in 2011 through [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Professor leaving Stanford for online education startup |url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/46138856/ns/technology_and_science-innovation/ |newspaper= [[MSNBC]] |date= 25 January 2012 |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thrun has stated he hopes half a million students will enroll, after an enrollment of 160,000 students in the predecessor course at Stanford, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ai-class.com/ Introduction to Artificial Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt; and 90,000 students had enrolled in the initial two classes {{As of|2012|03|lc=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Professor Departs Stanford U., Hoping to Teach 500,000 Students at Online Start-Up |first= Nick |last=DeSantis |url= http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/tenured-professor-departs-stanford-u-hoping-to-teach-500000-students-at-online-start-up/35135 |newspaper= Chronicle of Higher Education |date= 23 January 2012 |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Instruction for Masses Knocks Down Campus Walls |first=Tamar |last=Lewin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/05/education/moocs-large-courses-open-to-all-topple-campus-walls.html |newspaper = New York Times |date= 4 March 2012 |accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Udacity was announced at the 2012 [[Digital Life Design]] conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Udacity and the future of online universities |first=Felix |last=Salmon |url= http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/01/23/udacity-and-the-future-of-online-universities/ |newspaper= Reuters.com |date=23 January 2012 |accessdate=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Udacity is funded by venture capital firm, [[Charles River Ventures]], and $200,000 of Thrun's personal money.&lt;ref name='npr'/&gt; In October 2012, the venture capital firm [[Andreessen Horowitz]] led the investment of another $15 million in Udacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Startup Udacity Builds Bankroll For Online Learning |first=Don |last=Clark |url= https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2012/10/25/startup-udacity-builds-bankroll-for-online-learning/ |newspaper= Wall Street Journal |date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, Thrun announced in a Fast Company article that Udacity had a "lousy product" and that the service was pivoting to focus more on vocational courses for professionals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chafkin|first=Max|title=UDACITY'S SEBASTIAN THRUN, GODFATHER OF FREE ONLINE EDUCATION, CHANGES COURSE|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3021473/udacity-sebastian-thrun-uphill-climb|accessdate=20 December 2013|newspaper=Fast Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "nanodegrees."&lt;ref&gt;http://recode.net/2015/10/30/udacity-online-school-from-google-x-founder-crosses-milestone-after-switching-direction/&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2014|4|28}}, Udacity has 1.6 million users in 12 full courses and 26 free courseware.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.udacity.com/courses&lt;/ref&gt;

==Courses==
===Free courses===
The first two courses on Udacity started on 20 February 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Robotics Mastermind takes Education Online |first=Blake |last=Graham |url= http://theairspace.net/events/robotic-mastermind/ |newspaper= The Airspace |date=24 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled "CS 101: Building a Search Engine", taught by David Evans from the University of Virginia, and "CS 373: Programming a Robotic Car" taught by Thrun. Both courses use [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

Four more courses began on 16 April 2012, encompassing a range of ability and subject matter, with teachers including [[Steve Huffman]] and [[Peter Norvig]]. Five new courses were announced on 31 May 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://udacity.blogspot.com/2012/05/udacity-expands-course-offerings-five.html |title = Udacity expands course offerings: Five premiere classes will include physics and mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and marked the first time Udacity offered courses outside the domain of computer science. Four of these courses launched at the start of the third "[[Academic term|hexamester]]", on 25 June 2012. One course, Logic &amp; Discrete Mathematics: Foundations of Computing, was delayed for several weeks before an email announcement was sent out on 14 August stating that the course would not be launched, although no further explanation was provided.

On 23 August 2012, a new course in [[entrepreneurship]], EP245 taught by retired serial entrepreneur [[Steve Blank]], was announced.&lt;ref name="udacity-newsletter-2012-08"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.udacity.com/2012/08/udacity-august-newsletter-all-latest.html |title = Udacity August Newsletter: All the latest updates straight to your inbox!}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four new specialized CS courses were announced as part of collaboration with [[Google]], [[Nvidia]], [[Microsoft]], [[Autodesk]], [[Cadence Design Systems]], and [[Wolfram Research]] on 18 October 2012, to be launched in early 2013.&lt;ref name="udacity-new-classes-2012-10-18"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.udacity.com/2012/10/four-new-classes.html |title = Four New Classes! |date=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 28 November 2012, Thrun's original AI-class from 2011 was relaunched as a course at Udacity, CS271.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.udacity.com/2012/11/ai-class-now-on-udacity.html |title = The Original, Free Online AI Class, now on Udacity! |date = 2012-11-28 |accessdate=2012-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University credit courses===

Udacity announced a partnership with [[San Jose State University]] (SJSU) on 15 January 2013 to pilot three new courses, two algebra courses and a statistics course, available for college credit at SJSU and offered entirely online.&lt;ref name="udacity-sjsu-plus-announcement"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.udacity.com/2013/01/sebastian-thrun-udacity-announces-for.html |title = Sebastian Thrun: Udacity Announces For-Credit Course Pilot with San Jose State University |date = 2013-01-15 |accessdate=2013-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sjsu.edu/plus/ |title = San Jose State Plus |date = 2013-01-15 |accessdate=2013-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three months later, the pilot was expanded to include MA006, MA008, and ST095, as well as two new courses, CS046 and PS001.&lt;ref name="udacity-sjsu-plus-2013-04-15"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blog.udacity.com/2013/04/sebastian-thrun-expanding-college.html |title = Sebastian Thrun: Expanding College Credit Pilot this Summer! |date = 2013-04-15 |accessdate=2013-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 July 2013, the partnership was suspended after more than half of the students failed their final exams.&lt;ref name="sjsu-suspended-slate"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/07/19/san_jose_state_suspends_udacity_online_classes_after_students_fail_final.html |title = University Suspends Online Classes After More Than Half the Students Fail |date = 2013-07-19 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nanodegree===
{{expand section|date=April 2018}}
In June 2014, Udacity and [[AT&amp;T]] announced the "Nanodegree" program, designed to teach programming skills needed to qualify for an entry-level IT position at AT&amp;T. The coursework is said to take less than a year to complete, and cost about US$200/month.  AT&amp;T said it will offer paid internships to some graduates of the program.&lt;ref name="WSJ blog"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/06/16/udacity-att-team-up-in-online-ed/ | title=Udacity, AT&amp;T Team Up in Online Ed - Digits - WSJ | publisher=blog.wsj.com | accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/18/business/economy/udacity-att-nanodegree-offers-an-entry-level-approach-to-college.html?_r=0 | title=Udacity-AT&amp;T ‘NanoDegree’ Offers an Entry-Level Approach to College | publisher=nytimes.com |date=June 17, 2014 | accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;“We can’t turn you into a Nobel laureate,” Mr. Thrun said to a learner. “But what we can do is something like upskilling — you’re a smart person, but the skills you have are inadequate for the current job market, or don’t let you get the job you aspire to have. We can help you get those skills.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/17/technology/udacity-says-it-can-teach-tech-skills-to-millions.html|title=Udacity Says It Can Teach Tech Skills to Millions, and Fast|last=Manjoo|first=Farhad|date=2015-09-16|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[cybersecurity]] nanodegree was announced at the [[RSA Conference]] in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/22/udacity-tackles-cybersecurity-with-its-latest-nanodegree/|title=Udacity tackles cybersecurity with its latest nanodegree|last=Shieber|first=Jonathan|date=2018-04-22|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2018-04-24|publisher=Oath Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Course format===
Each course consists of several units comprising video lectures with [[closed captioning]], in conjunction with integrated quizzes to help students understand concepts and reinforce ideas, as well as follow-up homework, which promotes a "learn by doing" model.&lt;ref name='faq'&gt;[https://www.udacity.com/faq Udacity General FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Programming classes use the Python language; programming assignments are graded by automated grading programs on the Udacity servers.

==Enrollment==
Over the first several months of Udacity's existence, enrollment for each class was cut off on the due date of the first homework assignment, and the courses were re-offered each hexamester. Since August 2012, all courses have been "open enrollment"; students can enroll in one or more courses at any time after a course is launched. All course lectures and problem sets are available upon enrollment and can then be completed at the student's preferred pace.&lt;ref name='faq'/&gt;

Udacity had students in 203 countries in the summer of 2012, with the greatest number of students in the United States (42 percent), India (7 percent), Britain (5 percent), and Germany (4 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= Chronicle of Higher Education

|date=10 August 2012 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Udacity students for CS101 range from 13-year-olds to 80-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= A First for Udacity: a U.S. University Will Accept Transfer Credit for One of Its Courses   |newspaper= Chronicle of Higher Education |url=http://chronicle.com/article/A-First-for-Udacity-Transfer/134162/ |first=Katherine |last=Mangan |date=6 August 2012 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advanced 13-year-olds are able to complete multiple, higher-level computer science courses on Udacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Peter Norvig and Udacity host 13-year-old student |newspaper=Udacity blog |url=http://blog.udacity.com/2012/08/13-year-old-student-visits-udacity-team.html  
|date=27 August 2012 |accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification==
Udacity used to issue certificates of completion of individual courses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.udacity.com/2012/08/tell-world-you-took-udacity-class.html Udacity Blog: Finished your final? Get an official Udacity certificate]&lt;/ref&gt; but since May 2014 has stopped offering free non-identity-verified certificates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140419045000/http://blog.udacity.com/2014/04/phasing-out-certificates-of-free16.html Phasing out certificates of free courseware completion]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, beginning 24 August 2012, through partnership with electronic testing company [[Pearson VUE]], students of CS101 can elect to take an additional proctored 75-minute final exam for a fee of $89 in an effort to allow Udacity classes to "count towards a credential that is recognized by employers".&lt;ref name="udacity-newsletter-2012-08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="udacity-blog-pearson-vue-partnership"&gt;{{cite web |title=Udacity in partnership with Pearson VUE announces testing centers |url= http://blog.udacity.com/2012/06/udacity-in-partnership-with-pearson-vue.html |date = 2012-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="udacity-blog-pearson-cs101"&gt;{{cite web |title=Proctored exam for Intro to Computer Science now available |url= http://blog.udacity.com/2012/08/proctored-exam-in-basic-python-and.html |date = 2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further plans announced for certification options would include a "secured online examination" as a less expensive alternative to the in-person proctored exams.&lt;ref name="udacity-blog-pearson-cs101"/&gt;

[[Colorado State University]]'s Global Campus began offering transfer credit for the introductory computer science course (CS101) for Udacity students that take the final examination through a secure testing facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = CSU forging smart partnerships in online studies | date = 27 October 2012 | publisher = Gannett | url = http://www.coloradoan.com/article/20121027/OPINION01/310270029/CSU-forging-smart-partnerships-online-studies | work = Coloradoan.com | accessdate = 2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Udacity started the Nanodegree program, it is a paid credential program. Udacity also offers Nanodegree plus, which is a bit more expensive, but guarantees a job, if they fail to provide a job, the course fee is returned, although it plans to cancel the program.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.udacity.com/2016/07/nanodegree-101.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
In November 2012, founder Sebastian Thrun won the Smithsonian American Ingenuity in Education Award for his work with Udacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Sebastian Thrun wins Smithsonian American Ingenuity Award in Education for Udacity work!

== Spin-off company ==
In April 2017, Udacity announced a spin-off venture called Voyage Auto, a self-driving taxi company to compete with the likes of the Uber ride-hailing service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Udacity self-driving taxi spin-off Voyage takes aim at Uber |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-tech-voyage/udacity-self-driving-taxi-spin-off-voyage-takes-aim-at-uber-idUSKBN1782ST |website=Reuters |accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outfit has been testing its project, based on production vehicles, on low-speed private roads in a retirement community in San Jose, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Etherington |first1=Darrell |title=Udacity spin-out Voyage is testing self-driving cars in retirement communities |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/04/udacity-spin-out-voyage-is-testing-self-driving-cars-in-retirement-communities/ |website=TechCrunch |accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wing''' is a subsidiary of [[Alphabet Inc.]] that aims to rapidly deliver products across a city by using flying vehicles, similar to the [[Amazon Prime Air]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|magazine=AOPA Pilot|date=April 2015|page=63|title=Droning On}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the announcement on August 28, 2014, it had already been in development secretly at Google X for about two years, with full-scale testing being carried out in Australia. The flying vehicles take off vertically, then rotate to a horizontal position for flying around. For delivery, it hovers and winches packages down to the ground. At the end of the tether is a small bundle of electronics which detects that the package has hit the ground, detaches from the delivery, and is pulled back up into the body of the vehicle. Dropping the cargo or landing were found to be unfeasible, as users compromised the safety.&lt;ref name=gra1&gt;Warwick, Graham.
