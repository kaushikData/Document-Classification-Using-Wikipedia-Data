{{History of Fiji}}
The [[Fiji]]an '''constitutional crisis of 2009''' began on Friday, 10 April 2009. [[President of Fiji|Fijian President]] [[Josefa Iloilo|Ratu Josefa Iloilo]] announced on a nationwide radio broadcast that he was abrogating the [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|Constitution of Fiji]]. He dismissed all judges and constitutional appointees and assumed all [[governance]] in the country after the [[Court of Appeal of Fiji|Court of Appeal]] ruled that the government of Prime Minister [[Frank Bainimarama]] was illegal.&lt;ref name=ta&gt;{{cite news |title=Fijian president Ratu Josefa Iloilo abolishes constitution, sacks judiciary and assumes power

He also instituted emergency rule which increased police powers and allowed media censorship.

==Background==
{{Main article|2006 Fijian coup d'état}}
On Thursday, 9 April 2009, the [[Court of Appeal of Fiji|Court of Appeal]], the second highest in [[Fiji]], issued a [[court ruling|ruling]] stating the illegality of the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état]], which removed the government of [[Laisenia Qarase]] from power, replacing it with [[military dictatorship|military rule]].&lt;ref name=ta/&gt; The court also called the interim government established in January 2007 "invalid."&lt;ref name=tahitip&gt;{{cite news|title=Fiji under New Legal Order and new Head of State |url=http://www.tahitipresse.pf/index.cfm?snav=see&amp;presse=27226&amp;lang=2 |work=[[Tahitpresse]] |date=10 April 2009 |accessdate=10 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416222059/http://www.tahitipresse.pf/index.cfm?snav=see&amp;presse=27226&amp;lang=2 |archivedate=16 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling legally dissolved the current parliament.&lt;ref name=tahitip/&gt;

The Court of Appeals ordered President Iloilo to appoint a "distinguished person" to act as a caretaker Prime Minister and oversee the dissolution of parliament.&lt;ref name=tahitip/&gt; The court further ordered that Iloilo was forbidden from appointing either current Prime Minister [[Frank Bainimarama]] or former Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase as the caretaker.&lt;ref name=tahitip/&gt;

The Court of Appeals ruling "prompted" the Prime Minister to step down from power.&lt;ref name=ta/&gt; Iloilo had sworn Bainimarama into office in January 2007. Bainimarama immediately reverted to his former position as [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|army]] [[commander]].&lt;ref name=tahitip/&gt; His cabinet also resigned after the court's ruling.&lt;ref name=tahitip/&gt;

==Suspension of Constitution==
President Iloilo issued a statement the following day saying, "I hereby confirm I have abrogated the [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|1997 constitution]] and appointed myself as [[head of state]] in the new order."&lt;ref name=ta/&gt; Iloilo immediately assumed all political power in the country.&lt;ref name=ta/&gt;

In his statement, Iloilo fired the Fijian [[judiciary]] and nullified all judicial appointments.&lt;ref name=ta/&gt; He stated that "All judicial appointments are no longer in place. New appointments are to be made for judges, [[magistrate]]s and other [[judicial officer]]s. I will soon be inviting suitable individuals to join or rejoin the bench under the new order."&lt;ref name=tahitip/&gt; He also decreed that all existing laws would remain in place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=118899 New Order], Fiji Times Online, 11 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Iloilo announced that Fiji would hold democratic elections in September 2014 "at the latest."&lt;ref name=tahitip/&gt; He also promised to appoint an [[interim]] prime minister.&lt;ref name=ta/&gt; To that end, he issued a decree which allowed him to appoint a Prime Minister by decree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0411/breaking13.htm Fiji appoints coup leader as PM], The Irish Times, 11 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament had not met since the 2006 coup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pgaction.org/uploadedfiles/ICC%20Calendar%202008-2009%20_8-1-08_.pdf Parliamentary Campaign for the Universality and Effectiveness of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (PGA ICC Campaign 2008–2009)], Parliamentarians for Global Action, 18 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently re-appointed Frank Bainimarama as the "new" Interim prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/04/11/2540837.htm?section=world Bainimarama sworn in again as Fiji PM], Sean Dorney, ABC, 11 April 2009.

Fiji was placed under a "Public Emergency Regulation", putting the country under emergency rule for 30 days.&lt;ref name= "Xinhua" /&gt; This regulation gave the police the right "to control the movement of people" and to stop any broadcast or publication it deemed "could cause disorder, promote disaffection or public alarm or undermine the government or state of Fiji".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/national/fiji-may-face-economic-sanctions-says-canberra-20090411-a3hd.html?page=2 Fiji may face economic sanctions, says Canberra], Josh Gordon, The Age, 12 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On some key roads, police had established roadblocks but the military was not involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.brisbanetimes.com.au/breaking-news-world/fiji-military-chief-reappointed-as-pm-20090411-a33m.html Fiji military chief reappointed as PM], Pita Ligaiula, Brisbane Times, 11 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Police "postponed" any assemblies of more than 100 people and revoked permits already issued including the annual meeting of the Fiji Nursing Association and perhaps the elections of the Fiji Teachers Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijilive.com/news_new/index.php/news/show_news/15257 Public meetings postponed, say police] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419182015/http://www.fijilive.com/news_new/index.php/news/show_news/15257 |date=19 April 2009 }}, Fijilive, 16 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In July, the annual Methodist general meeting was not given a permit. Several Methodist Church leaders and a village high chief who was providing space for the meeting were arrested and released on condition that they not appear in public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/julyweb-only/130-2.0.html Fiji Bans Massive Methodist Hymn-Sing], Christianity Today, 31 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TVNZ_2870943"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/world-news/church-challenges-fiji-regime-s-power-2870943 |title=Church challenges Fiji regime's power |date=25 July 2009 |work=[[One News (New Zealand)|ONE News]] |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Methodist annual meeting scheduled for August was later cancelled by church leadership.

All positions established under the 1997 Constitution were held to be vacant. In the following days, some of these office holders were reinstalled into the same offices, including the Commissioner of Police, the Commissioner of Prisons, the Commander of the RFMF, the Solicitor General.&lt;ref name="RNZI_45963"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=45963 |title=Fiji Reserve Bank gets new governor |date=15 April 2009 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others were not reappointed as in the case of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji who was replaced by the Deputy Governor. Other positions were not immediately refilled, such as the courts, the Constitutional Offices Commission, the Judicial Service Commission, the Disciplined Services Commission and the Human Rights Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=119288 3 commissions not reinstated], Fiji Times, 16 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.news.yahoo.com/43/20090414/902/twl-fiji-military-government-tightens-co.html Fiji military government tightens control]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, DPA, 14 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 July, President Iloilo, 88 years old and thought to be ill, retired after having served since 2000 through all the coups, except for one month in 2006 when Bainimarama gave himself Presidential powers. Iloilo was replaced by the Vice-President, [[Brigadier-General]] [[Epeli Nailatikau|Ratu Epeli Nailatikau]], a former military commander. Under the 1997 Constitution, the President was supposed to be appointed by the Great Council of Chiefs, but with the Constitution suspended, Bainimarama announced that a replacement would be appointed by himself and his Cabinet at a time suitable for the regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-07/28/content_11786348.htm Fiji's 88-year-old president retires], Xinhua, 28 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_2683048"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/2683048/Fijis-president-quits |title=Fiji's president quits |author=Field, Michael |date=28 July 2009 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
As well as the rest of the world, Fiji had been influenced by the [[global financial crisis of 2008–2009]] before the constitutional crisis began. Fiji's foreign currency reserves had fallen by 1/3 during 2008 and, in February 2009, [[Standard and Poor's]] downgraded Fiji's long term credit rating from stable to negative.&lt;ref name="SP"&gt;[http://www.michaelfield.org/S&amp;P.htm Outlook On Fiji Revised To Negative On Rising External Pressures; ŒB/B Rating Affirmed]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Standard and Poor's, 27 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Exports increased in 2008 and inflation declined; however, cashflow suffered from the global financial crisis and imports increased leading to a larger negative [[balance of trade]].&lt;ref name ="SP" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftib.org.fj/uploaded_documents/Economic%20Review%20February%202009.pdf Economic Review]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Vol. 26, No. 02, Reserve Bank of Fiji, February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

After the constitutional crisis began, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Fiji was removed from his position, as were all other people appointed to positions under the 1997 Constitution. The Reserve Bank quickly made several major moves, imposing currency exchange restrictions and devaluing the currency by 20% to benefit exporters and tourism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=ajvPqV2sZP0U&amp;refer=home Fiji Devalues Local Dollar 20 Percent, Central Bank Announces], James Regan, Bloomberg, 15 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 April, the Bank ordered Australian banks operating in Fiji to limit interest rates and institute [[microlending]] programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-business/fiji-tells-aussie-banks-to-cut-rates-20090416-a8n3.html Fiji tells Aussie banks to cut rates], Alison Bell, Sydney Morning Herald, 16 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standard and Poor's]] lowered Fiji's credit rating on 16 April, with short term credit falling to a C from a B rating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=119355 Fiji's credit rating down], Fiji Times, 16 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 April, [[Moody's]] lowered Fiji's government bond, foreign currency bank deposit and foreign currency bond ratings, into [[junk bond]] status, stating "Political instability is weakening Fiji's long-term economic strength" among other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090421-718892.html Moody's Lowers Fiji's Ratings Amid Political Unrest], ''The Wall Street Journal'', 21 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In a move claimed to be aimed at cutting public corruption,  Bainimarama announced "As a first up, from next week, all government vehicles being driven after hours will need to carry permits." Soldiers and police would be empowered to check for these permits.&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt;

As a cost-cutting measure, the mandatory retirement age for civil servants was reduced to 55, with 30 April 2009 set as the retirement day for any over that age.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10567012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10567012 |title=Fiji slashes retirement age in bid to cut costs |author=Young, Audrey |date=17 April 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, the Fiji Teacher Association had been fighting the order to lower the retirement age from 60 to 55; the Public Service Association had later joined as a party to the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="RNZI_45545"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=45545 |title=Fiji’s Teachers Association prepares for Supreme Court case over retirement at 55 |date=25 March 2009 |work=[[Radio New Zealand International]] |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain high-level positions were given a retirement age of 65, including the position of Commander of the Military Forces held by Bainimarama who will turn 55 three days before the decree goes into effect. The decree was expected to force the retirement of over 800 teachers and about 100 nurses. (Another 40 nurses had already moved overseas during 2009 before the decree.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijilive.com/news_new/index.php/news/show_news/15302 1000 Fiji civil servants to retire, say unions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306024759/http://www.fijilive.com/news_new/index.php/news/show_news/15302 |date=6 March 2012 }}, Fiji Live, 17 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suppression of the Media==

Reports indicated that as part of the Emergency Regulation "a Ministry of Information officer and a plain-clothed policeman would be stationed in every newsroom".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-04/10/content_11163772.htm Public emergency regulation in force in Fiji], Xinhua News Agency, 10 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Permanent Secretary of the Department of Information explained the policy, saying that media are to "refrain from publishing and broadcasting any news item that is negative in nature, relating to the assumption of executive authority on 10 April...and the subsequent appointments..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=119353 We comply with regulations], ''Fiji Times'', 16 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the decree as a form of protest, [[Fiji One]] TV did not run its evening news program and the ''[[Fiji Times]]'' went to press with large blank spaces where censored articles were removed. The ''[[Fiji Sun]]'' announced that it would no longer run any political stories of any sort.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090413/wl_asia_afp/fijipoliticscouppacific_20090413105609 'Deep concern' after Fiji throws out journalists]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, AFP, 13 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Post (Fiji)|Fiji Daily Post]]'' mocked the restrictions, publishing stories under "Man gets on bus"&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090503120930/http://www.fijidailypost.com/news.php?section=1&amp;fijidailynews=23081 Man gets on bus], Fiji Daily Post, 15 April 2009.

On 13 April two of the last remaining foreign journalists in Fiji were called to Government House by the Ministry of Information.  ABC Pacific Correspondent Sean Dorney was asked to voluntarily leave Fiji—which he refused citing his valid visa—and TV3 reporter Sia Aston's footage was confiscated by Fijian authorities.  Both Dorney and Aston were deported from Fiji on 14 April, with Aston and TV3 cameraman Matt Smith banned from ever returning to Fiji, with the interim Government stating that all three had breached their visa conditions.&lt;ref name=radionz1&gt;[http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/stories/2009/04/14/1245aa006045 TV3 news pair banned from returning to Fiji] Radio New Zealand News, 14 April 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222054828/http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/stories/2009/04/14/1245aa006045 |date=22 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stuff2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/2338529/Journalists-most-welcome-to-Fiji |title=Journalists 'most welcome' to Fiji |date=16 April 2009 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=18 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hj1knhAL?url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/2338529/Journalists-most-welcome-to-Fiji |archivedate=22 June 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Edwin Nand, a local journalist for Fiji TV, was imprisoned for 36 hours after he interviewed Dorney.&lt;ref name="RadioNZ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/south-pacific/2336132/Bainimarama-attacks-New-Zealand-govt |title=Bainimarama attacks New Zealand govt |author=Field, Michael |date=15 April 2009 |work=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fijian Military spokesman Neumi Leweni stated that foreign journalists were welcome in Fiji, but must first apply and that "the invitation is decidedly conditional."&lt;ref name=stuff2/&gt; However, during an interview with [[Radio New Zealand]], Bainimarama said it was not necessary for their reporter to visit Fiji: "You just ask me the questions, I will give you the answers."&lt;ref name= "RadioNZ"/&gt; On 17 April, military spokesman Neumi Leweni said foreign media personnel would have to apply to his office for visas and approval would be "based on how they have reported about Fiji in the past, if they have, or on the undertaking that they will report accurately and responsibly."&lt;ref name="Field"/&gt;

Fijian media outlets and journalists have also come under government scrutiny.

The Government has also shut down two [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] [[Transmitter|FM transmitters]], meaning that both ABC and [[Radio New Zealand International]] are only available to Fiji via the [[shortwave]] service.&lt;ref name=radionz2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/stories/2009/04/15/1245aa0f4649 |title=Media in Fiji told to adopt 'journalism of hope' |date=17 April 2009 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |accessdate=18 September 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hj1lc1AS?url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/stories/2009/04/15/1245aa0f4649 |archivedate=22 June 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Internet cafes have also become a target because of independent news bloggers, with many having to shut down.  Networks, software and archives are inspected by government officials, with Commodore Bainimarama saying that free speech "causes trouble" and must be curbed in order for the Government to carry out reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1015570/Fiji-crackdown-intensifies Fiji crackdown intensifies], World News Australia, 15 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Local political reaction==
The [[Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua]] party declared that the suspension of the constitution was another coup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=118913 It is another coup, says SDL party], Fiji Times Online, 11 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Federation Party]] also condemned the President's actions.

==International reaction==

The forum's chair, [[Niue]]'s [[Premier of Niue|Premier]] [[Toke Talagi]], is also advocating immediate suspension.&lt;ref name=stuff2/&gt;

[[Samoa]]n Prime Minister [[Tuilaepa Sailele]] took a particularly strong stance, saying "But one day soon the puppets will grow a brain and see Frank for the evil puppeteer he really is.

The [[United Nations Security Council]] issued a statement: "The members of the Security Council are deeply concerned about the situation in Fiji, where undemocratic decisions were made, including the abrogation of the constitution.

The [[Commonwealth of Nations]] suspended Fiji from its councils. In August, the Commonwealth gave Fiji until 1 September to announce scheduled elections to occur no later than October 2010.

'''Arms trafficking''', also known as '''gunrunning''', is the trafficking of contraband [[weapon]]s and [[ammunition]]. What constitutes legal trade in firearms varies widely, depending on local and national laws.

The 1999 Report of the UN Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms provides a more refined and precise definition, which has become internationally accepted. This distinguishes between small arms (revolvers and self-loading pistols, rifles and [[carbine]]s, [[submachine gun]]s, [[assault rifle]]s, and light machine guns), which are weapons designed for personal use, and light weapons (heavy machine guns, hand-held under-barrel and mounted [[grenade launcher]]s, portable anti-aircraft guns, portable anti-tanks guns, [[recoilless rifle]]s, portable launchers of anti-aircraft missile systems, and mortars of calibres less than 100&amp;nbsp;mm), which are designed for use by several persons serving as a unit. Ammunition and explosives also form an integral part of small arms and light weapons used in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greene |first=O. |title=Examining international responses to illicit arms trafficking |journal=Crime, Law &amp; Social Change |year=2000 |volume=33 |url=http://www.criminology.fsu.edu/transcrime/articles/armstraffickingagreements.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323050427/https://www.criminology.fsu.edu/transcrime/articles/armstraffickingagreements.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

===Areas===
Although arms trafficking is widespread in regions of political turmoil, it is not limited to such areas, and for example, in [[South Asia]], an estimated 63 million guns have been trafficked into India and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Daily Star|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/05/30/d6053001107.htm|date= May 30, 2006 	|title=
Bangladesh turned into arms smuggling route; Experts critical of govt's indifference|author=Staff Correspondent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suppression of gunrunning is one of the areas of increasing interest in the context of [[international law]]. Examples of past and current gunrunning include:
* [[Iran–Contra affair]]
* [[Larne gun-running]]
* [[Provisional Irish Republican Army arms importation]]

In the United States, the term "[[Iron Pipeline]]" is sometimes used to describe [[Interstate Highway 95]] and its connector highways as a corridor for arms trafficking into New York City.&lt;ref name=Enos&gt;{{cite book|last=Enos|first=Sandra L.|editor=Gregg Lee Carter|title=Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oD46JBOhMU0C&amp;pg=PA440|accessdate=7 May 2015|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313386701|pages=440–44|chapter=Iron Pipeline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market value===
The total value of the global arms market is estimated around $60 billion a year, with around $8 billion attributed to pistols, rifles, machine guns, and bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Whitney, Craig R. |date=December 2012 |url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/winter2012/ruling-arms |title=Ruling Arms |work=World Policy Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total illegal arms trade is harder to estimate, but the illicit [[small arms trade|small arms market]] has been estimated at 10–20% of the total global arms trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Schroeder, Matt |author2=Lamb, Guy |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2006 |url=https://fas.org/asmp/library/articles/SchroederLamb.pdf |title=The Illicit Arms Trade in Africa |work=African Analyst |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221133132/http://www.fas.org/asmp/library/articles/SchroederLamb.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2007 |accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Customs and Border Protection Service''' was the [[Government of Australia|Australian federal government]] agency responsible for managing the security and integrity of the Australian border. It facilitated the movement of legitimate international travellers and goods, whilst protecting the safety, security and commercial interests of Australians.{{sfn|Australian Customs and Border Protection Service|2011|p=X}}

The Service was an agency under the [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]] from 2009 to 2013 and was then transferred to the newly formed [[Department of Immigration and Border Protection]] in 2013 until its transformation into the Border Force in 2015.

The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service employed over 5,800 people around Australia and overseas and was headquartered in Canberra.{{sfn|Australian Customs and Border Protection Service|2011}}

==Agency role==
The Service defined its role as follows:
''“Our role is complex and diverse and requires a very considered and increasingly targeted approach to conducting our business. If we do not manage our responsibilities effectively, the potential impacts… may negatively affect the Australian community, international travellers and trade relations both here and overseas”'' &lt;ref name="CEOreview2011"&gt;[http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/minisites/annualreport1011/ceo_review.html CEO Review], Customs and Border Protection, 1 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Service was Australia's predominant border control agency. From international travellers at airports, to overseas mail and trade brought in by sea, it was responsible for the continued safety and security of the people and goods that travel across Australia's borders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page4222.asp About Us], Customs and Border Protection, 1 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Australian Customs.jpg|thumb|An Offshore Patrol Vessel of the [[Customs Marine Unit]] docked in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Northern Territory]]]]
In conjunction with the Australian Defence Force, the Service facilitated Australia's response to the detection and rescue of 'suspected irregular entry vessels' that smuggled people from South-East Asia into Australian waters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpc.gov.au Border Protection Command], 1 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The agency was also responsible for the discovery and apprehension of 'illegal foreign fishing vessels', the patrol of remote Australian and international waters, and aerial surveillance of Australia’s coastline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpc.gov.au/site/page5777.asp Maritime Security Threats], Border Protection Command, 1 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve these functions, the Service operated its own air and sea patrol unit, the [[Customs Marine Unit (Australia)|Customs Marine Unit]].

The Service used an intelligence-led, risk-based approach to managing threats, focussing on specific targets that may pose a risk to the border.{{sfn|Australian Customs and Border Protection Service|2011|p=X}} This allowed the agency to plan coordinated responses, interventions and strategies with various other government agencies, including; [[Australian Crime Commission]], [[Australian Federal Police]], [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General’s Department]], [[Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Australia)|Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry]], [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]], [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]], [[Department of Immigration and Border Protection]] and the [[Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development#Office of Transport Security|Office of Transport Security]].&lt;ref name="BPCpartneragencies"&gt;[http://www.bpc.gov.au/site/page5603.asp Partner Agencies], Border Protection Command, 1 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Import and export control===
Customs controlled the import and export of goods to and from Australia, in particular the control of prohibited or restricted items, and the interception of illegal and potentially harmful goods such as drugs, weapons and computer games. Techniques used to target high-risk aircraft, vessels, cargo, postal items and travellers included using intelligence, computer-based profiling and analysis, [[Australian Customs Detector Dog Program|detector dogs]], [[Smartgate]], container X-ray facilities, closed-circuit television (CCTV) monitoring and other means.

Customs officers at air and sea ports, in addition to performing basic immigration control (see below), assessed passengers [[Arrival card|arrival]] and [[departure card]]s, and had the authority to scan and search passenger baggage. Quarantine risk material could be referred to [[Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service]] officers.

Goods arriving from overseas by post were cleared by Customs and AQIS officers before being released to [[Australia Post]] for delivery.

Customs collected [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] (GST) on taxable goods imported into Australia.

Customs administered the Tourist Refund Scheme (TRS) for tourists visiting Australia temporarily or Australian residents leaving the country, allowing them, under certain conditions, to claim a refund of the GST or [[Wine equalisation tax]] on items purchased in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page4646.asp Tourist Refund Scheme], Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, 1 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===People smuggling===
The Service was the lead agency in the Australian government’s response to people-smuggling and often performed activities on behalf of other agencies&lt;ref name="BPCpartneragencies" /&gt; including:
* Monitoring Australian waters for potential people smuggling vessels
* Intercepting boats carrying immigrants without valid visas with Bay Class vessels&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/BayClassVesselsFactSheet.pdf Bay Class Vessels], Customs and Border Protection, 1 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* Transporting people found in vessels to Australian territory for immigration and quarantine assessment
* Coordinating education and awareness campaigns overseas to deter people-smuggling activities

===Terrorism===
The Service operated under the 'National Counter-Terrorism Plan', which was a plan intended to mitigate any risk of terrorism in Australia. The Service worked in conjunction with other Australian Government departments to screen and target any potential threats moving across the border,{{sfn|Australian Customs and Border Protection Service|2011}} including:
* Air and sea passengers
* Cargo (sea, air and mail)
* Maritime surveillance
* Remote area patrols

===Illegal entry===
The Service was responsible for processing all travellers entering&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page4443.asp Arriving Passengers], Customs and Border Protection, 1 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and leaving&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page4725.asp Departing Travellers]&lt;/ref&gt; the country. At the border, Service officers would check all passengers to ensure compliance with customs, immigration and quarantine requirements. The Service's purpose was to stop people without correct documentation or [[Electronic visas (Australia)|visas]] from entering the country.

===Controlled substances===
One of the largest areas of work undertaken by the Service was in relation to the importation of [[narcotics trafficking|narcotics]] and [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] substances and the smuggling of illegal amounts of tobacco.{{sfn|Australian Customs and Border Protection Service|2011}} Examination techniques such as x-ray, trace detection technology and detector dogs were used to screen people, goods, mail, vessels and aircraft moving across Australia’s border.

===Objectionable material===
Australian law prohibits the importing of any material of an offensive or grotesque nature.{{sfn|Australian Customs and Border Protection Service|2011}} The Service worked to prevent the importation of material that was either refused classification by the Australian Classification Board, or was unclassified but would not be deemed as acceptable viewing by the [[Australian Classification Board]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.customs.gov.au/site/page4369.asp#e1070 Pornography and Objectionable Material], Australian Customs and Border Protection, 1 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This included material in [[electronic media|electronic form]] such as CDs or DVDs, computer hard drives and within electronic games. Prohibited material included:
* Child pornography
* Offensive or sexualised violence
* Terrorist material
* Drug use

===Illegal foreign fishing===
The Service was the lead agency coordinating regular patrol (both aerial surveillance and on-water) of Australia's 'Exclusive Economic Zone' to detect and deter any foreign fishing vessels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/FS_Heard_Is_Mcdonald_Is1.pdf Patagonian Tooth Fish Factsheet], Australian Customs and Border Protection, 1 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Along with dedicated in-country education programs designed to deter people from undertaking illegal fishing,{{sfn|Australian Customs and Border Protection Service|2011}} the Service's work saw a continual decline in the rates of foreign fishing vessels entering the EEZ.

==History==
===Establishment===
The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service had its origins in the [[Department of Trade and Customs (Australia)|Department of Trade and Customs]], established at [[Federation of Australia|federation]] in 1901. The organisation was restructured several times since, including becoming the [[Department of Customs and Excise]] in 1958 and then briefly the [[Department of Police and Customs]] in 1975.{{sfn|Bannon|2007|p=12}} Later that same year, the Bureau of Customs was established, which remained the Australian Government's customs agency until 1985 when the Australian Customs Service was established.{{sfn|Bannon|2007|p=12}}

In December 2008 then [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Kevin Rudd]] announced that the Australian Government would be augmenting, re-tasking and renaming the Australian Customs Service to create the new Australian Customs and Border Protection Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/browse.php?did=16289|title=The First National Security Statement to the Parliament Address by the Prime Minister of Australia The Hon. Kevin Rudd MP|date=4 December 2008|first=Kevin|last=Rudd|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230025339/http://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/browse.php?did=16289|archivedate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royal assent was given to the changes on 22 May 2009 and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service was established.&lt;ref name="NAA CA 9259"/&gt;

===Australian Border Force===
In 2015, the Australian Government announced changes to the Immigration and Border Protection portfolio in relation to future border protection arrangements. From 1 July 2015, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service were consolidated into a single Department of Immigration and Border Protection. At this time, the [[Australian Border Force]], a single frontline operational border agency, was established within the department. The Australian Border Force draws together the operational border, investigations, compliance, detention and enforcement functions of the two existing agencies. Policy, regulatory and corporate functions will combine within the broader department.{{refn|For more information about the changes, read the [http://www.minister.immi.gov.au/media/sm/2014/sm214247.htm Minister for Immigration and Border Protection's speech] announcing the new arrangements on 9 May 2014 and the [http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/Australian-Border-Force.pdf Australian Border Force booklet].|group=Note}}

'''BaFá BaFá''' is a face-to-face learning [[simulation]] (game), invented by Dr. R. Garry Shirts in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dukes|first1=Richard L.|last2=Fowler|first2=Sandra M.|last3=Dekoven|first3=Bernie|title=R.

The simulation is intended to improve participants' cross-[[cultural competence]] by helping them understand the impact of culture on the behavior of people and organizations. Participants experience "culture shock" by traveling to and trying to interact with a culture in which the people have different values, different ways of behaving and different ways of solving problems. There are three versions, one for high schools, charities and universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BaFa' BaFa' - Culture/Diversity for Schools &amp; Charities|url=http://www.simulationtrainingsystems.com/schools-and-charities/products/bafa-bafa/|website=Simulation Training Systems|accessdate=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; one for middle school aged children called '''RaFá RaFá''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rafa' Rafa' - Cultural Diversity Game|url=http://www.simulationtrainingsystems.com/schools-and-charities/products/rafa-rafa/|website=Simulation Training Systems|accessdate=June 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a professional version&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional BaFa' BaFa' - A Cross Culture/Diversity Simulation|url=http://www.simulationtrainingsystems.com/corporate/products/bafa-bafa/|website=Simulation Training Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; for business and government agencies.

==Origin==
"Around 1971, the U.S. Navy became very concerned about the behavior of American Sailors on leave in foreign ports, specifically Greece and Japan, and determined to do something to avoid incidents that were threatening relations between the United States and its allies. The Navy Personnel Research and Development Center approached Garry Shirts for assistance in creating a simulation that would teach naval personnel about the specific cultures where incidents had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yellen|first1=Ted M I|last2=Hoover|first2=Margaret W|title=In-Country Experience: Navy Personnel Stationed in Greece.|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA123184|website=DTIC.mil|accessdate=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy had created print material, readily available to the sailors, that explained Greek culture, so a lack of information was not the problem; it was the apparent failure to put it to use.

Shirts decided that educating people was only part of the answer; it was also necessary to help them understand the nature of culture itself and its impact on human interaction. This would, he postulated, motivate them to learn how to interact effectively within any cultural environment. The result was the simulation game BaFá BaFá, which was originally accompanied by training modules, a comic strip, and language tapes. This was the first intercultural simulation, and when it was made generally available in 1974, it became the most widely used and well-known simulation in the field (Shirts 1974, 1975). It was founded on the idea of having trainees learn and become members of two contrasting cultures, Alpha and Beta, and then visiting each other. One is a more collectivist, people-oriented, touching culture, and the other, using a different language, is more individualistic and task oriented. The point of the interaction between members of the two cultures is to teach "that what seems irrational, contradictory, or unimportant to us in our culture may seem rational, consistent, and terribly important in another culture" (Shirts, 1995). Other simulations have been created in the field, but all owe some credit for inspiration to this one, the classic that has provided a model for intercultural simulation games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Bennett Dan Landis |editor2=Janet M.

More traditional means of access control include token-based identification systems, such as a [[driver's license]] or [[passport]], and knowledge-based identification systems, such as a [[password]] or [[personal identification number]].&lt;ref name="JainA" /&gt; Since biometric identifiers are unique to individuals, they are more reliable in verifying identity than token and knowledge-based methods; however, the collection of biometric identifiers raises [[#Privacy and discrimination|privacy concerns]] about the ultimate use of this information.&lt;ref name="JainA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weaver"&gt;Weaver, A. C. (2006). "Biometric Authentication". ''Computer'', 39 (2), p. 96–97. DOI 10.1109/MC.2006.47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biometric functionality==
Many different aspects of human physiology, chemistry or behavior can be used for biometric authentication. The selection of a particular biometric for use in a specific application involves a weighting of several factors. Jain ''et al.'' (1999)&lt;ref name=Jain2&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified seven such factors to be used when assessing the suitability of any trait for use in biometric authentication. 
* Universality means that every person using a system should possess the trait.
* Uniqueness means the trait should be sufficiently different for individuals in the relevant population such that they can be distinguished from one another. 
* Permanence relates to the manner in which a trait varies over time. More specifically, a trait with 'good' permanence will be reasonably invariant over time with respect to the specific matching algorithm. 
* Measurability (collectability) relates to the ease of acquisition or measurement of the trait. In addition, acquired data should be in a form that permits subsequent processing and extraction of the relevant feature sets. 
* Performance relates to the accuracy, speed, and robustness of technology used (see [[Biometrics#Performance|performance]] section for more details). 
* Acceptability relates to how well individuals in the relevant population accept the technology such that they are willing to have their biometric trait captured and assessed. 
* Circumvention relates to the ease with which a trait might be imitated using an artifact or substitute.

Proper biometric use is very application dependent. Certain biometrics will be better than others based on the required levels of convenience and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Biometrics comes of age: despite accuracy and security concerns, biometrics are gaining in popularity|last = Bleicher|first = Paul|date = 2005|journal = Applied Clinical Trials|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; No single biometric will meet all the requirements of every possible application.&lt;ref name=Jain2 /&gt;

[[File:Biometric system diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.5]]The block diagram illustrates the two basic modes of a biometric system.&lt;ref name=Jain1/&gt; First, in [[Authentication|verification]] (or authentication) mode the system performs a one-to-one comparison of a captured biometric with a specific template stored in a biometric database in order to verify the individual is the person they claim to be. Three steps are involved in the verification of a person.&lt;ref name=Choubisa&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sahoo |first=Soyuj Kumar |last2=Choubisa |first2=Tarun |last3=Prasanna |first3=SR Mahadeva |title=Multimodal Biometric Person Authentication : A Review |journal=IETE Technical Review |date=1 January 2012 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=54–75 |doi=10.4103/0256-4602.93139 |url=http://tr.ietejournals.org/text.asp?2012/29/1/54/93139 |access-date=23 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116103048/http://tr.ietejournals.org/text.asp?2012%2F29%2F1%2F54%2F93139 |archive-date=16 January 2014 |df=dmy-all |doi-inactive-date=May 2018 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first step, reference models for all the users are generated and stored in the model database. In the second step, some samples are matched with reference models to generate the genuine and impostor scores and calculate the threshold. Third step is the testing step. This process may use a [[smart card]], username or ID number (e.g. [[Personal identification number|PIN]]) to indicate which template should be used for comparison.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Systems can be designed to use a template stored on media like an [[Biometric passport|e-Passport]] or [[smart card]], rather than a remote database.&lt;/ref&gt; 'Positive recognition' is a common use of the verification mode, "where the aim is to prevent multiple people from using the same identity".&lt;ref name=Jain1 /&gt;

Second, in identification mode the system performs a one-to-many comparison against a biometric database in an attempt to establish the identity of an unknown individual. The system will succeed in identifying the individual if the comparison of the biometric sample to a template in the [[database]] falls within a previously set threshold. Identification mode can be used either for 'positive recognition' (so that the user does not have to provide any information about the template to be used) or for 'negative recognition' of the person "where the system establishes whether the person is who she (implicitly or explicitly) denies to be".&lt;ref name=Jain1 /&gt; The latter function can only be achieved through biometrics since other methods of personal recognition such as [[passwords]], PINs or keys are ineffective.

The first time an individual uses a biometric system is called ''enrollment''. During the enrollment, biometric information from an individual is captured and stored. In subsequent uses, biometric information is detected and compared with the information stored at the time of enrollment. Note that it is crucial that storage and retrieval of such systems themselves be secure if the biometric system is to be robust. The first block (sensor) is the interface between the real world and the system; it has to acquire all the necessary data. Most of the times it is an image acquisition system, but it can change according to the characteristics desired. The second block performs all the necessary pre-processing: it has to remove [[artifact (error)|artifact]]s from the sensor, to enhance the input (e.g. removing background noise), to use some kind of [[normalization (image processing)|normalization]], etc. In the third block necessary features are extracted. This step is an important step as the correct features need to be extracted in the optimal way. A vector of numbers or an image with particular properties is used to create a ''template''. A template is a synthesis of the relevant characteristics extracted from the source. Elements of the biometric measurement that are not used in the comparison algorithm are discarded in the template to reduce the filesize and to protect the identity of the enrollee{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

During the enrollment phase, the template is simply stored somewhere (on a card or within a database or both). During the matching phase, the obtained template is passed to a matcher that compares it with other existing templates, estimating the distance between them using any algorithm (e.g. [[Hamming distance]]). The matching program will analyze the template with the input. This will then be output for any specified use or purpose (e.g. entrance in a restricted area){{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.
Selection of biometrics in any practical application depending upon the characteristic measurements and user requirements.&lt;ref name=Choubisa /&gt; In selecting a particular biometric, factors to consider include, performance, social acceptability, ease of circumvention and/or spoofing, robustness, population coverage, size of equipment needed and [[identity theft]] deterrence. Selection of a biometric based on user requirements considers sensor and device availability, computational time and reliability, cost, sensor size and power consumption.

==Multimodal biometric system==
Multimodal biometric systems use multiple sensors or biometrics to overcome the limitations of unimodal biometric systems.&lt;ref name="dca"&gt;M. Haghighat, M. Abdel-Mottaleb, &amp;  W. Alhalabi (2016). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2016.2569061 Discriminant Correlation Analysis: Real-Time Feature Level Fusion for Multimodal Biometric Recognition]. IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, 11(9), 1984–1996.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance iris recognition systems can be compromised by aging irises&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Questions Raised About Iris Recognition Systems | url = http://sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120712141938.htm | date = 12 July 2012 | work = Science Daily | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121022051152/http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120712141938.htm | archivedate = 22 October 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and finger scanning systems by worn-out or cut fingerprints. While unimodal biometric systems are limited by the integrity of their identifier, it is unlikely that several unimodal systems will suffer from identical limitations. Multimodal biometric systems can obtain sets of information from the same marker (i.e., multiple images of an iris, or scans of the same finger) or information from different biometrics (requiring fingerprint scans and, using voice recognition, a spoken pass-code).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Mobile Wave: How Mobile Intelligence Will Change Everything |last=Saylor |first=Michael |year=2012 |publisher=Perseus Books/Vanguard Press |page=99 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJqxM8sAJmIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = This is the 'biometric war' Michael Saylor was talking about | url = http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/techflash/2013/10/this-is-the-biometric-war-michael.html | date = 3 October 2013 | work = Washington Business Journal | author = Bill Flook | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131007031912/http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/techflash/2013/10/this-is-the-biometric-war-michael.html | archivedate = 7 October 2013 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multimodal biometric systems can fuse these unimodal systems sequentially, simultaneously, a combination thereof, or in series, which refer to sequential, parallel, hierarchical and serial integration modes, respectively.
Fusion of the biometrics information can occur at different stages of a recognition system. In case of feature level fusion, the data itself or the features extracted from multiple biometrics are fused. Matching-score level fusion consolidates the scores generated by multiple [[classification rule|classifiers]] pertaining to different modalities. Finally, in case of decision level fusion the final results of multiple classifiers are combined via techniques such as [[majority voting]]. Feature level fusion is believed to be more effective than the other levels of fusion because the feature set contains richer information about the input biometric data than the matching score or the output decision of a classifier. Therefore, fusion at the feature level is expected to provide better recognition results.&lt;ref name=dca /&gt;

[[Spoof attack]]s consist in submitting fake biometric traits to biometric systems, and are a major threat that can curtail their security. Multi-modal biometric systems are commonly believed to be intrinsically more robust to spoof attacks, but recent studies&lt;ref&gt;Zahid Akhtar, [http://pralab.diee.unica.it/sites/default/files/Akhtar_PhD2012.pdf "Security of Multimodal Biometric Systems against Spoof Attacks"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402104529/http://pralab.diee.unica.it/sites/default/files/Akhtar_PhD2012.pdf |date=2 April 2015 }}, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy, 6 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that they can be evaded by spoofing even a single biometric trait.

==Performance==
The following are used as performance metrics for biometric systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccert.edu.cn/education/cissp/hism/039-041.html|title=Characteristics of Biometric Systems|publisher=Cernet|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017165633/http://www.ccert.edu.cn/education/cissp/hism/039-041.html|archivedate=17 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''False match rate''' (FMR, also called FAR = False Accept Rate): the probability that the system incorrectly matches the input pattern to a non-matching template in the database. It measures the percent of invalid inputs that are incorrectly accepted. In case of similarity scale, if the person is an imposter in reality, but the matching score is higher than the threshold, then he is treated as genuine. This increases the FMR, which thus also depends upon the threshold value.&lt;ref name=Choubisa /&gt;
* '''False non-match rate''' (FNMR, also called FRR = False Reject Rate): the probability that the system fails to detect a match between the input pattern and a matching template in the database. It measures the percent of valid inputs that are incorrectly rejected.
* '''[[Receiver operating characteristic]]''' or relative operating characteristic (ROC): The ROC plot is a visual characterization of the trade-off between the FMR and the FNMR. In general, the matching algorithm performs a decision based on a threshold that determines how close to a template the input needs to be for it to be considered a match. If the threshold is reduced, there will be fewer false non-matches but more false accepts. Conversely, a higher threshold will reduce the FMR but increase the FNMR. A common variation is the ''Detection error trade-off (DET)'', which is obtained using normal deviation scales on both axes. This more linear graph illuminates the differences for higher performances (rarer errors).
* '''Equal error rate''' or crossover error rate (EER or CER): the rate at which both acceptance and rejection errors are equal. The value of the EER can be easily obtained from the ROC curve. The EER is a quick way to compare the accuracy of devices with different ROC curves. In general, the device with the lowest EER is the most accurate.
* '''Failure to enroll rate''' (FTE or FER): the rate at which attempts to create a template from an input is unsuccessful. This is most commonly caused by low quality inputs.
* '''Failure to capture rate''' (FTC): Within automatic systems, the probability that the system fails to detect a biometric input when presented correctly.
* '''Template capacity''': the maximum number of sets of data that can be stored in the system.

==History==
{{further|Biostatistics}}

An early cataloging of fingerprints dates back to 1891 when Juan Vucetich started a collection of fingerprints of criminals in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onin.com/fp/fphistory.html The History of Fingerprints] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312012330/http://onin.com/fp/fphistory.html |date=12 March 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Josh Ellenbogen and Nitzan Lebovic argued that Biometrics is originated in the identificatory systems of criminal activity developed by Alphonse Bertillon (1853–1914) and developed by Francis Galton's theory of fingerprints and physiognomy.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Ellenbogen, ''Reasoned and Unreasoned Images: The Photography of Bertillon, Galton, and Marey'' (University Park, PA, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lebovic, Galton's work "led to the application of mathematical models to fingerprints, phrenology, and facial characteristics", as part of "absolute identification" and "a key to both inclusion and exclusion" of populations.&lt;ref&gt;Nitzan Lebovic, "Biometrics or the Power of the Radical Center", in ''Critical Inquiry'' 41:4 (Summer, 2015), 841–868.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, "the biometric system is the absolute political weapon of our era" and a form of "soft control".&lt;ref&gt;Nitzan Lebovic, "Biometrics or the Power of the Radical Center", in ''Critical Inquiry'' 41:4 (Summer, 2015), p. 853.&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretician David Lyon showed that during the past two decades biometric systems have penetrated the civilian market, and blurred the lines between governmental forms of control and private corporate control.&lt;ref&gt;David Lyon, ''Surveillance Society: Monitoring Everyday Life'' (Philadelphia, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Kelly A. Gates identified 9/11 as the turning point for the cultural language of our present: "in the language of cultural studies, the aftermath of 9/11 was a moment of articulation, where objects or events that have no necessary connection come together and a new discourse formation is established: automated facial recognition as a homeland security technology." Kelly A. Gates, ''Our Biometric Future: Facial Recognition Technology and the Culture of Surveillance'' (New York, 2011), p.&amp;nbsp;100.

==Adaptive biometric systems==
Adaptive biometric systems aim to auto-update the templates or model to the intra-class variation of the operational data.&lt;ref&gt;A. Rattani, "Adaptive Biometric System based on Template Update Procedures", PhD thesis, University of Cagliari, Italy, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The two-fold advantages of these systems are solving the problem of limited training data and tracking the temporal variations of the input data through adaptation. Recently, adaptive biometrics have received a significant attention from the research community. This research direction is expected to gain momentum because of their key promulgated advantages. First, with an adaptive biometric system, one no longer needs to collect a large number of biometric samples during the enrollment process. Second, it is no longer necessary to re-enroll or retrain the system from scratch in order to cope with the changing environment. This convenience can significantly reduce the cost of maintaining a biometric system. Despite these advantages, there are several open issues involved with these systems. For mis-classification error (false acceptance) by the biometric system, cause adaptation using impostor sample. However, continuous research efforts are directed to resolve the open issues associated to the field of adaptive biometrics. More information about adaptive biometric systems can be found in the critical review by Rattani ''et al.''

==Recent advances in emerging biometrics==
In recent times, biometrics based on brain ([[Electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]]) and heart ([[Electrocardiography|electrocardiogram]]) signals have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;[R. Palaniappan, "Electroencephalogram signals from imagined activities: A novel biometric identifier for a small population", published in E. Corchado ''et al.'' (eds): ''Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning – IDEAL 2006'', Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 4224, pp. 604–611, Springer-Verlag, Berlin Heidelberg, 2006. DOI:10.1007/11875581_73]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Palaniappan, and S. M. Krishnan, "Identifying individuals using ECG signals", ''Proceedings of International Conference on Signal Processing and Communications'', Bangalore, India, pp. 569–572, 11–14 December 2004. DOI:10.1109/SPCOM.2004.1458524]&lt;/ref&gt; The research group at [[University of Kent]] led by [http://sites.google.com/site/rpalanisenthi/ Ramaswamy Palaniappan] has shown that people have certain distinct brain and heart patterns that are specific for each individual. Another example is [[finger vein recognition]], using pattern-recognition techniques, based on images of human vascular patterns. The advantage of such 'futuristic' technology is that it is more fraud resistant compared to conventional biometrics like fingerprints. However, such technology is generally more cumbersome and still has issues such as lower accuracy and poor reproducibility over time. 
This new generation of biometrical systems is called [http://hir.harvard.edu/behavioral-profiling-politics-intent/ biometrics of intent] and it aims to scan ''intent''. The technology will analyze physiological features such as eye movement, body temperature, breathing etc. and predict dangerous behaviour or hostile intent before it materializes into action.

On the portability side of biometric products, more and more vendors are embracing significantly miniaturized biometric authentication systems (BAS) thereby driving elaborate cost savings, especially for large-scale deployments.

===Operator signatures===
An operator signature is a biometric mode where the manner in which a person using a device or complex system is recorded as a verification template.&lt;ref name="langston2015" /&gt; One potential use for this type of biometric signature is to distinguish among remote users of [[Telerobotics|telerobotic]] surgery systems that utilize public networks for communication.&lt;ref name="langston2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scientificcomputing.com/news/2015/05/researchers-hack-teleoperated-surgical-robot-reveal-security-flaws |title=Researchers hack Teleoperated Surgical Robot to Reveal Security Flaws |author=Langston, Jennifer |date=8 May 2015 |accessdate=17 May 2015 |work=[[Scientific Computing]] |location=New Jersey |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050336/http://www.scientificcomputing.com/news/2015/05/researchers-hack-teleoperated-surgical-robot-reveal-security-flaws |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A basic premise in the above proposal is that the person that has uniquely authenticated themselves using biometrics with the computer is in fact also the agent performing potentially malicious actions from that computer. However, if control of the computer has been subverted, for example in which the computer is part of a [[botnet]] controlled by a hacker, then knowledge of the identity of the user at the terminal does not materially improve network security or aid law enforcement activities.&lt;ref name="Schneier-Anonymous"&gt;{{cite web

Recently, another approach to biometric security was developed, this method scans the entire body of prospects to guarantee a better identification of this prospect. This method is not globally accepted because it is very complex and prospects are concerned about their privacy.

==Issues and concerns==

===Human dignity===
Biometrics have been considered also instrumental to the development of state authority&lt;ref&gt;Breckenridge K. (2005). "[https://wiser.wits.ac.za/sites/default/files/Breckenridge%20-%202005%20-%20The%20Biometric%20State%20The%20promise%20and%20peril%20of%20digi.pdf The Biometric State: The Promise and Peril of Digital Government in the New South Africa]". ''Journal of Southern African Studies'', 31:2, 267–82&lt;/ref&gt; (to put it in Foucauldian terms, of [[discipline]] and [[biopower]]&lt;ref&gt;Epstein C. (2007), "[https://academic.oup.com/ips/article-abstract/1/2/149/1799677 Guilty Bodies, Productive Bodies, Destructive Bodies: Crossing the Biometric Borders]". ''International Political Sociology'', 1:2, 149–64&lt;/ref&gt;). By turning the human subject into a collection of biometric parameters, biometrics would dehumanize the person,&lt;ref&gt;Pugliese J. (2010), ''Biometrics: Bodies, Technologies, Biopolitics.'' New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; infringe bodily integrity, and, ultimately, offend human dignity.&lt;ref&gt;French National Consultative Ethics Committee for Health and Life Sciences (2007), Opinion N° 98, [http://www.ccne-ethique.fr/en/publications/biometrics-identifying-data-and-human-rights#.VenJ87TDU5E "Biometrics, identifying data and human rights"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923201410/http://www.ccne-ethique.fr/en/publications/biometrics-identifying-data-and-human-rights |date=23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a well-known case,&lt;ref&gt;Agamben, G. (2008). "No to bio-political tattooing". ''Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies'', 5(2), 201–202. Reproduced from Le Monde (10 January 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] refused to enter the United States in protest at the United States Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator (US-VISIT) program’s requirement for visitors to be fingerprinted and photographed. Agamben argued that gathering of biometric data is a form of bio-political tattooing, akin to the tattooing of Jews during the Holocaust. According to Agamben, biometrics turn the human persona into a bare body. Agamben refers to the two words used by Ancient Greeks for indicating "life", ''zoe'', which is the life common to animals and humans, just life; and ''bios'', which is life in the human context, with meanings and purposes. Agamben envisages the reduction to bare bodies for the whole humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Agamben G.(1998), ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life''. Trans. Daniel Heller-Roazen. Stanford: Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; For him, a new bio-political relationship between citizens and the state is turning citizens into pure biological life (''zoe'') depriving them from their humanity (''bios''); and biometrics would herald this new world.

In [https://www.dukeupress.edu/dark-matters Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness], [[surveillance]] scholar [[Simone Browne (sociologist)|Simone Browne]] formulates a similar critique as Agamben, citing a recent study&lt;ref name="Gao 169–178"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221383488_Face_Gender_Classification_on_Consumer_Images_in_a_Multiethnic_Environment|title=Face Gender Classification on Consumer Images in a Multiethnic Environment|last=Gao|first=Wei|last2=Ai|first2=Haizhou|pages=169–178|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-01793-3_18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009123149/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221383488_Face_Gender_Classification_on_Consumer_Images_in_a_Multiethnic_Environment|archivedate=9 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; relating to biometrics [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] that found that the gender classification system being researched "is inclined to classify Africans as males and [[Mongoloid]]s as females."&lt;ref name="Gao 169–178"/&gt; Consequently, Browne argues that the conception of an objective biometric technology is difficult if such systems are subjectively designed, and are vulnerable to cause errors as described in the study above. The stark expansion of biometric technologies in both the public and private sector magnifies this concern. The increasing [[commodification]] of biometrics by the private sector adds to this danger of loss of human value. Indeed, corporations value the biometric characteristics more than the individuals value them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=25+Fordham+Intell.+Prop.+Media+%26+Ent.+L.J.+831&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=a4b55d68b2513a0c985a62bb9064501d|title = Biometric Boom: How the private sector Commodifies Human characteristics|last = Walker|first = Elizabeth|date = 2015|journal = Fordham Intellectual Property, Media &amp; Entertainment Law Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170120172630/https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay|archivedate = 20 January 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Browne goes on to suggest that modern society should incorporate a "biometric consciousness" that "entails informed public debate around these technologies and their application, and accountability by the state and the private sector, where the ownership of and access to one's own body data and other intellectual property that is generated from one's body data must be understood as a right."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness|last=Browne|first=Simone|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;Mordini, E; Massari, S. (2008), "Body, Biometrics and Identity" ''Bioethics'', 22, 9:488&lt;/ref&gt; have emphasized, however, that the globalized world is confronted with a huge mass of people with weak or absent civil identities. Most developing countries have weak and unreliable documents and the poorer people in these countries do not have even those unreliable documents.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF, [http://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_58010.html Birth Registration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906150500/http://www.unicef.org/protection/57929_58010.html |date=6 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without certified personal identities, there is no certainty of right, no civil liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Dahan M., Gelb A. (2015) [http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2015/07/24849193/role-identification-post-2015-development-agenda "The Role of Identification in the Post-2015 Development Agenda"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920050041/http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2015/07/24849193/role-identification-post-2015-development-agenda |date=20 September 2015 }} – World Bank Working Paper No. 98294 08/2015;&lt;/ref&gt; One can claim her rights, including the right to refuse to be identified, only if she is an identifiable subject, if she has a public identity. In such a sense, biometrics could play a pivotal role in supporting and promoting respect for human dignity and fundamental rights.&lt;ref&gt;Mordini E, Rebera A (2011) "No Identification Without Representation: Constraints on the Use of Biometric Identification Systems". ''Review of Policy Research'', 29, 1: 5–20&lt;/ref&gt;

The biometrics of intent poses further risks. In [http://hir.harvard.edu/behavioral-profiling-politics-intent/ his paper] in Harvard International Review, Prof [[Nayef Al-Rodhan]] cautions about the high risks of miscalculations, wrongful accusations and infringements of civil liberties. Critics in the US have also signalled a conflict with the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th Amendment]].

===Privacy and discrimination===
{{see|privacy|right to privacy|medical privacy}}
It is possible that data obtained during biometric enrollment may be used in ways for which the enrolled individual has not consented. For example, most biometric features could disclose physiological and/or pathological medical conditions (e.g., some fingerprint patterns are related to chromosomal diseases, iris patterns could reveal genetic sex, hand vein patterns could reveal vascular diseases, most behavioral biometrics could reveal neurological diseases, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Mordini E, Ashton H,(2012), "The Transparent Body – Medical Information, Physical Privacy and Respect for Body Integrity", in Mordini E, Tzovaras D (eds), ''Second Generation Biometrics: the Ethical and Social Context''. Springer-Verlag: Berlin&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, second generation biometrics, notably behavioral and electro-physiologic biometrics (e.g., based on [[electrocardiography]], [[electroencephalography]], [[electromyography]]), could be also used for [[emotion detection]].&lt;ref&gt;Mordini E, Tzovaras D,(2012), ''Second Generation Biometrics: the Ethical and Social Context''. Springer-Verlag: Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;

# Unintended functional scope: The authentication goes further than authentication, such as finding a tumor.
# Unintended application scope: The authentication process correctly identifies the subject when the subject did not wish to be identified.
# Covert identification: The subject is identified without seeking identification or authentication, i.e. a subject's face is identified in a crowd.

===Danger to owners of secured items===
When thieves cannot get access to secure properties, there is a chance that the thieves will stalk and assault the property owner to gain access. If the item is secured with a biometric device, the damage to the owner could be irreversible, and potentially cost more than the secured property. For example, in 2005, Malaysian car thieves cut off the finger of a [[Mercedes-Benz S-Class]] owner when attempting to steal the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4396831.stm|title=Malaysia car thieves steal finger|last=Kent|first=Jonathan|date=31 March 2005|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=11 December 2010|location=Kuala Lumpur|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120203534/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4396831.stm|archivedate=20 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancelable biometrics===
One advantage of passwords over biometrics is that they can be re-issued. If a token or a password is lost or stolen, it can be cancelled and replaced by a newer version. This is not naturally available in biometrics. If someone's face is compromised from a database, they cannot cancel or reissue it. If the electronic biometric identifier is stolen, it is nearly impossible to change a biometric feature. This renders the person’s biometric feature questionable for future use in authentication, such as the case with the hacking of security-clearance-related background information from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in the United States.

Cancelable biometrics is a way in which to incorporate protection and the replacement features into biometrics to create a more secure system. It was first proposed by Ratha ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;N. K. Ratha, J. H. Connell, and R. M. Bolle, "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Connell/publication/220353130_Enhancing_Security_and_Privacy_in_Biometrics-Based_Authentication_Systems/links/555a010508ae6fd2d8281b10/Enhancing-Security-and-Privacy-in-Biometrics-Based-Authentication-Systems.pdf Enhancing security and privacy in biometrics-based authentication systems]", ''IBM Systems Journal'', vol. 40, pp. 614–634, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Cancelable biometrics refers to the intentional and systematically repeatable distortion of biometric features in order to protect sensitive user-specific data. If a cancelable feature is compromised, the distortion characteristics are changed, and the same biometrics is mapped to a new template, which is used subsequently. Cancelable biometrics is one of the major categories for biometric template protection purpose besides biometric cryptosystem."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cancelable biometrics – Scholarpedia|url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Cancelable_biometrics|website = www.scholarpedia.org|accessdate = 2015-11-05|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151003215140/http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Cancelable_biometrics|archivedate = 3 October 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biometric cryptosystem, "the error-correcting coding techniques are employed to handle intraclass variations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feng|first=Y. C.|last2=Yuen|first2=P. C.|last3=Jain|first3=A.

Several methods for generating new exclusive biometrics have been proposed. The first fingerprint-based cancelable biometric system was designed and developed by Tulyakov ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;S. Tulyakov, F. Farooq, and V. Govindaraju, "[https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~tulyakov/papers/tulyakov_ICAPR05_fingerprint_hash.pdf Symmetric Hash Functions for Fingerprint Minutiae]", ''Proc. Int'l Workshop Pattern Recognition for Crime Prevention, Security, and Surveillance'', pp. 30–38, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, cancelable biometrics perform a distortion of the biometric image or features before matching. The variability in the distortion parameters provides the cancelable nature of the scheme. Some of the proposed techniques operate using their own recognition engines, such as Teoh ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;A. B. J. Teoh, A. Goh, and D. C. L. Ngo, "Random Multispace Quantization as an Analytic Mechanism for BioHashing of Biometric and Random Identity Inputs", ''Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, IEEE Transactions on'', vol. 28, pp. 1892–1901, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and Savvides ''et al.'',&lt;ref&gt;M. Savvides, B. V. K. V. Kumar, and P. K. Khosla, "'Corefaces' – Robust Shift-Invariant PCA based Correlation Filter for Illumination Tolerant Face Recognition", presented at IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR'04), 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other methods, such as Dabbah ''et al.'',&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Dabbah, W. L. Woo, and S. S. Dlay, "Secure Authentication for Face Recognition", presented at Computational Intelligence in Image and Signal Processing, 2007. CIISP 2007. IEEE Symposium on, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; take the advantage of the advancement of the well-established biometric research for their recognition front-end to conduct recognition. Although this increases the restrictions on the protection system, it makes the cancellable templates more accessible for available biometric technologies

===Soft biometrics===
[[Soft biometrics]] traits are physical, behavioral or adhered human characteristics that have been derived from the way human beings normally distinguish their peers (e.g. height, gender, hair color). They are used to complement the identity information provided by the primary biometric identifiers. Although soft biometric characteristics lack the distinctiveness and permanence to recognize an individual uniquely and reliably, and can be easily faked, they provide some evidence about the users identity that could be beneficial. In other words, despite the fact they are unable to individualize a subject, they are effective in distinguishing between people. Combinations of personal attributes like gender, race, eye color, height and other visible identification marks can be used to improve the performance of traditional biometric systems.&lt;ref&gt;Ratha, N. K., J. H. Connell, and R. M. Bolle. (2001). "Enhancing security and privacy in biometrics based authentication systems". ''IBM Systems Journal'' 40(3): 614–634.&lt;/ref&gt; Most soft biometrics can be easily collected and are actually collected during enrollment. Two main ethical issues are raised by soft biometrics.&lt;ref&gt;Mordini E, Ashton H (2012), "The Transparent Body – Medical Information, Physical Privacy and Respect for Body Integrity'". In Mordini E, Tzovaras D (eds), [https://www.springer.com/us/book/9789400738911 ''Second Generation Biometrics: the Ethical and Social Context''. Berlin: Springer-Verlag] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216025115/https://www.springer.com/us/book/9789400738911 |date=16 February 2018 }}, 2057–83&lt;/ref&gt; First, some of soft biometric traits are strongly cultural based; e.g., skin colors for determining ethnicity risk to support racist approaches, biometric sex recognition at the best recognizes gender from tertiary sexual characters, being unable to determine genetic and chromosomal sexes; soft biometrics for aging recognition are often deeply influenced by ageist stereotypes, etc. Second, soft biometrics have strong potential for categorizing and profiling people, so risking of supporting processes of stigmatization and exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Mordini E (2013) ''Biometrics''. In Henk A. M. J. ten Have, Bert Gordijn (eds) ''Handbook of Global Bioethics'' Berlin: Springer, 341–356&lt;/ref&gt;

===International sharing of biometric data===
Many countries, including the United States, are planning to share biometric data with other nations.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; commented on international cooperation and collaboration with respect to biometric data, as follows:
{{cquote|''To ensure we can shut down terrorist networks before they ever get to the United States, we must also take the lead in driving international biometric standards. By developing compatible systems, we will be able to securely share terrorist information internationally to bolster our defenses. Just as we are improving the way we collaborate within the U.S. Government to identify and weed out terrorists and other dangerous people, we have the same obligation to work with our partners abroad to prevent terrorists from making any move undetected. Biometrics provide a new way to bring terrorists’ true identities to light, stripping them of their greatest advantage—remaining unknown.''}}

According to an article written in 2009 by S. Magnuson in the National Defense Magazine entitled "Defense Department Under Pressure to Share Biometric Data" the United States has bilateral agreements with other nations aimed at sharing biometric data.&lt;ref name="DefensePressureShare"&gt;{{Cite journal

{{cquote|''Miller [a consultant to the Office of Homeland Defense and America's security affairs] said the United States has bilateral agreements to share biometric data with about 25 countries. Every time a foreign leader has visited Washington during the last few years, the State Department has made sure they sign such an agreement.''}}

===Likelihood of full governmental disclosure===
Certain members of the civilian community are worried about how biometric data is used but full disclosure may not be forthcoming. In particular, the Unclassified Report of the United States' Defense Science Board Task Force on Defense Biometrics states that it is wise to protect, and sometimes even to disguise, the true and total extent of national capabilities in areas related directly to the conduct of security-related activities.&lt;ref name="OnDefenseBiometrics"&gt;{{Citation |mode=cs1

=== Biometric authentication in the future ===

The world is at a threshold where everyone and everything has become more connected. This interconnectivity ensures easy access to data, to improve oneself or the harm others. For technologies within biometric authentication to evolve six pillars are considered to be paramount for this&lt;ref&gt;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=820038&lt;/ref&gt;:

1. Establishing authenticity. The system should at all times be able to recognize the user of the system.

2. Enhancing performance. Biometrics should improve processes within companies and make it easier at, for example, airports for passengers. By having quick and thorough checks, a lot of time can be saved.

3. Accuracy. Correct authentication is not always guaranteed. In the traditional password system, a correct password always corresponds with an identity. In biometrics authentication does not happen 100% of the times.

4. Costs. The results should outweigh the costs necessary to implement the systems.

5. Integrity. Authentication is of no use if the system cannot assure that the user provided that characteristic is indeed the owner.

6. Ease of use.
 

For the biometric world to evolve, two factors are needed:

Personal privacy should be a core element while developing all new products/services. Anyone who is involved in the creation of the new technologies must ensure that it is appropriately used.

Any political issue should be adequately formulated in such a way that contradiction between the interests of stakeholders is limited, if not prevented.
Not only should the technologies be created to stop hackers/identity thefts, but also to help more underprivileged parts of society&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.nl/books?hl=nl&amp;lr=&amp;id=DDLVCYjsSKMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=+In+Second+generation+biometrics:+The+ethical,+legal+and+social+context&amp;ots=aZSs6OeKZ6&amp;sig=vnrJWVFdO52gjZJiVW4Tnx-39Fc#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20Second%20generation%20biometrics%3A%20The%20ethical%2C%20legal%20and%20social%20context&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;. All of this while attaining high levels of business information integrity and overcoming users’ security fears were of utmost concern.&lt;ref&gt;http://biometrics.cse.msu.edu/Publications/GeneralBiometrics/JainKumar_BiometricsNextGeneration_Overview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Breton Party''' ([[French language|French]]: ''Parti Breton'', [[Breton language|Breton]]: ''Strollad Breizh'')  is a social-democratic{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} and social-liberal{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} nationalist party which aspires to the creation of an independent republic of [[Brittany]], within the [[European Union]].

==Program==
The movement was created in 2002. Its objective is to give Brittany the necessary institutions for its economic, social, cultural, environmental and political development. Brittany is defined as both the modern administrative [[Région]] of "[[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]]" and the [[département]] of [[Loire-Atlantique]], which includes [[Nantes]], the former capital of the [[Duchy of Brittany]].  Its aspirations include regional autonomy comparable to other European regions as [[Flanders]] or [[Catalonia]], or full independence, as with [[Ireland]].

The main idea is that Brittany has always been a [[nation]], therefore has rights and liberties within the [[European Union]]. The Breton Party claims the creation of a Breton State, member of the European Union, officially recognized by international authorities. It argues that beyond the principle that a nation should have independent rights, Brittany also has everything to gain by such a process of emancipation, on economic, cultural or environmental fronts.

The slogan of the Breton Party is "emancipated and reunited Brittany". Analyzing the causes for the "stagnation of the Breton political movements", the party wants "to take the Bretons as they are and not as one would like them to be". In terms of the left-right axis, the Breton Party is considered to be [[centrist]]. The main objective is first of all to create Breton political ''institutions''. Claiming 400 members, most of whom have had no association with the earlier [[Breton nationalism|Breton movement]], the Breton Party has members from the center-left, such as the professor and the contractor Jean-Paul Moisan from [[Nantes]], or the center-right, such as Gérard Olliéric, the current president of the party.

==Youth Wing==
''Ar Vretoned Yaouank'' is the youth section of the party created in 2007. Its purpose is to lead activities specific to youth connected to the party, but in an informal way. In 2006 the Young Bretons participated in the International Youth Days organized by the [[Basque National Party]] in [[Bilbao]] and were received by the [[Lehendakari]], leader of the Basque government.

==Elections==

The Breton Party has contested several elections: two by-elections in 2004, and again in 2005. Its candidates obtained for their first outing between 1.5% and 4% of the vote.

In the general election of 2007, 4 candidates were put forward:

*Yves Le Mestric for the constituency of [[Vitré, Ille-et-Vilaine|Vitré]] ([[Ille-et-Vilaine]]): 686 votes or 0.89%
*Gérard Guillemot for the constituency of [[Rennes]] ([[Ille-et-Vilaine]]): 249 votes or 0.57%
*Emile Granville for the constituency of [[Redon]] ([[Ille-et-Vilaine]]): 847 votes or 1.27%
*Hervé Le Guen for the constituency of [[Lorient]] ([[Morbihan]]): 686 votes or 1.44%

In a local by-election in [[Redon]] on September 23, 2007, Émile Granville obtained 3.58%. In a 2009 by-election in the same canton, he won 4.08%.

In 2008, Yann Jestin, president of Askol, obtained 25.18% of the votes during the cantonal elections in [[Lesneven]].

During the municipal elections in March 2008, the Breton Party ran about twenty candidates and obtained about ten municipal elected representatives among whom were a mayor and three deputies.

In the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (France)|2009 European elections]], the party ran one list in the West constituency, which won 2.45% across the five Breton departments. Its highest result was 3.41% in the [[Finistère]]. It won up to 16% in a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Côtes-d'Armor]] department.

In the [[French regional elections, 2010]] the Breton Party fielded candidates in Brittany and the Pays de Loire regions, viz;

*[[Christian Troadec]] for the presidency of Brittany: 47,108 votes or 4.29%
*Jacky Flippot for the presidency of Pays de Loire: 11,669 votes or 0.99% (most from the city of [[Nantes]])

'''COBRA''' COunter Battery RAdar is a [[Counter-battery radar]] system developed jointly by [[Thales Group|Thales]], [[Airbus Defence and Space]] and [[Lockheed Martin]] for the [[German Armed Forces]]. It is a mobile [[Active electronically scanned array]] [[3D radar]] based on a wheeled  chassis for the purpose of enemy [[field artillery]] acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/cobra|title=COBRA - Thales|website=www.thalesgroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are believed to be about 20,000 [[Gallium arsenide]] integrated circuits in each antenna. This enables the equipment to produce the locations of multiple enemy artillery at extremely long ranges, and the radar is able to cope with saturation type bombardments. In addition there is a high degree of automated software, with high speed circuitry and secure data transmission to escape detection from enemy electronic countermeasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armedforces.co.uk/army/listings/l0119.html|title=British Army - Artillery - Artillery Locating Devices - Cobra - Armed Forces - a6a11|website=www.armedforces.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|right|thumb|300px|An example of a charter ([[Magna Carta]]).]]
A '''charter''' is  the grant of [[authority]] or [[rights]], stating that the granter formally recognizes the [[prerogative]] of the recipient to exercise the rights specified. It is implicit that the granter retains superiority (or [[sovereignty]]), and that the recipient admits a limited (or inferior) status within the relationship, and it is within that sense that charters were historically granted, and that sense is retained in modern usage of the term.

The word entered the [[English language]] from the [[Old French]] ''charte'', via [[Latin]] ''charta'', and ultimately from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] χάρτης (''khartes'', meaning "layer of papyrus"). It has come to be synonymous with a document that sets out a grant of rights or privileges.

== Colloquial usages ==
The term is used for a special case (or as an exception) to an institutional '''charter'''. A  [[charter school]], for example, is one that has different rules, regulations, and statutes from a state school.

'''Charter''' is sometimes used as a synonym for "tool" or "lease", as in the "charter" of a [[charter bus|bus]] or [[charter boat|boat]] or [[charter plane|plane]] by an organization, intended for a similar group destination.

A '''charter member''' of an organization is an original member; that is, one who became a member when the organization received its charter.

==Different types of charters==
===Anglo-Saxon charters===
{{main|Anglo-Saxon charters}}
[[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] charters are documents from the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|early medieval period]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]] which typically make a grant of [[Real Estate|land]] or record a privilege. They are usually written on [[parchment]], in [[Latin]] but often with sections in the vernacular, describing the bounds of estates, which often correspond closely to modern parish boundaries. The earliest surviving charters were drawn up in the 670s; the oldest surviving charters granted land to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]], but from the 8th century surviving charters were increasingly used to grant land to [[lay person|lay people]].

===Charter colony===
{{main|Charter colony}}
The [[British Empire]] used three main types of colonies as it sought to expand its territory to distant parts of the earth. These three types were royal colonies, [[proprietary colonies]], and corporate colonies. A charter colony by definition is a "colony chartered to an individual, trading company, etc., by the [[British crown]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/charter%20colony charter colony - Definitions from Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Although charter colonies were not the most prevalent of the three types of colonies in the British Empire, they were by no means insignificant.

===Congressional charter===
{{main|Congressional charter}}
A '''congressional charter''' is a law passed by the [[United States Congress]] that states the mission, authority, and activities of a group. Congress issued federal charters from 1791 until 1992 under [[Title 36 of the United States Code]].

===Municipal charter===
{{main|Municipal charter}}
A '''municipal corporation''' is the legal term for a [[local government|local governing body]], including (but not necessarily limited to) [[city|cities]], [[county|counties]], [[town]]s, [[township]]s, [[charter township]]s, [[village]]s, and [[borough]]s. '''Municipal incorporation''' occurs when such [[municipality|municipalities]] become self-governing entities under the laws of the state or province in which they are located. Often, this event is marked by the award or declaration of a municipal charter.

=== Order charter ===
Charters for [[chivalric order]]s and other orders, such as the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].
{{Orders}}

===Project charter===
{{main|Project charter}}
In [[project management]], a '''project charter''' or '''project definition''' (sometimes called the [[terms of reference]]) is a statement of the scope, objectives and participants in a project. It provides a preliminary delineation of roles and responsibilities, outlines the project objectives, identifies the main stakeholders, and defines the authority of the project manager.  It serves as a reference of authority for the future of the project.

===Royal charter===
{{main|Royal charter}}
In medieval Europe, royal charters were used to create cities (i.e., localities with recognised legal rights and privileges). The date that such a charter was granted is considered to be when a city was "founded", regardless of when the locality originally began to be settled.

At one time a royal charter was the only way in which an incorporated body could be formed, but other means (such as the registration process for [[limited company|limited companies]]) are generally now used instead.

===Inspeximus charter===
A charter of "Inspeximus" (Latin, literally "We have inspected") is frequently a royal charter, by which an earlier charter or series of charters relating to a particular foundation (such as a monastery or a guild) was recited and incorporated into a new charter, usually in order to confirm and renew its validity under present authority. Where the original documents are lost, an inspeximus charter may sometimes preserve their texts and lists of witnesses.

Prior to appearing in the film as a politician oblivious to climate change, actor [[Ed Begley Jr.]] was an outspoken advocate of [[environmentalism]] for many years.&lt;ref name="swann" /&gt; He had his house outfitted with [[solar power]] in accordance with the standards of [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED).&lt;ref name="swann" /&gt;

The film was first released on the website [[Funny or Die]] on April 14, 2015.&lt;ref name="funny"&gt;{{citation|accessdate=April 9, 2016|title=Climate Change Denial Disorder with Ed Begley Jr.|date=April 14, 2015|work=[[Funny or Die]]|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/9bd64b041b/climate-change-denial-disorder|archivedate=March 17, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317081817/http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/9bd64b041b/climate-change-denial-disorder}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funny or Die published the video on [[YouTube]] on April 16, 2015.&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZTTI_0mHN0|accessdate=April 9, 2016|work=[[Funny or Die]]|publisher=[[YouTube]]|title=Climate Change Denial Disorder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The plot takes the form of a spoof [[public service announcement]], with the narrator explaining that the disorder attacks the brain, leaving the victim unable to comprehend words related to climate change included "factual" and "melting". Characters included in the film are a male politician and another man and a woman, who each present views removed from reality with regards to the [[Environmental change|environment changing]] around them. The narrator concludes the film by exhorting the viewer to assist politicians that are suffering from the fictional disease.

''Climate Change Denial Disorder'' is structured in the form of a spoof [[public service announcement]].&lt;ref name="theguardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rondicker" /&gt; The narrator begins the film by introducing the [[fictional disease]] with a question for the viewer: "Does your parent, grandparent or political representative suffer from Climate Change Denial Disorder? CCDD is a rapidly spreading disease that, world health officials say, if left untreated, could destroy the entire planet."&lt;ref name="mellino" /&gt;

[[Ed Begley Jr.]] portrays a politician unaware of the [[Effects of global warming|environmental changes occurring around him]].&lt;ref name="velez" /&gt; He is shown attempting to paddle a canoe through a paved parking lot.&lt;ref name="swann" /&gt; The politician smiles while gazing directly at the viewer and says:  "I’m gonna wait til more horrible shit happens to our planet — and I'm a senator, so fortunately, I get to make those decisions for all of us."&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt;

The narrator explains the mechanism of the disorder while an illustrated video of the brain is displayed: "Climate Change Denial Disorder is a rapidly spreading disease that attacks the neurons, making it impossible to comprehend basic words."&lt;ref name="velez" /&gt; Words eventually removed from comprehension by those suffering from the disorder are said to include: "factual", "science", and "melting".&lt;ref name="swann" /&gt;

Another man says to the camera that he feels [[global warming]] is "a bunch of [[New Age]] hooey garbage".&lt;ref name="velez" /&gt; He goes on to exclaim: "It's snowing right now, who cares if I'm in Southern California!"&lt;ref name="velez" /&gt; He explains his thinking behind ignoring scientists, stating: "I'm not a scientist. Who listens to those nerds anyway?"&lt;ref name="velez" /&gt;

A woman faces the camera and states her disbelief that [[Earth]]'s [[polar ice cap]]s are melting. She gives her rationale for what is occurring: "I believe the polar bears are just getting fatter and weighing them down. Ever think of that, hippies?"&lt;ref name="velez" /&gt;

The narrator concludes the film by stating: "56 percent of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in Congress have been severely infected with CCDD and need your help immediately."&lt;ref name="velez" /&gt;

==Reception==
The film had a positive reception from media publications, with ''[[The Guardian]]'' describing it a "poignant video"&lt;ref name="theguardian" /&gt; and ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' calling it "spot-on".&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt; [[Biologist]] Mary Ellen Harte of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' characterized the film as "absolutely hilarious",&lt;ref name="harte" /&gt; and ''[[BuzzFeed]]'' concluded: "Funny Or Die nailed this satirical video about climate change deniers."&lt;ref name="velez" /&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Travis Irvine highlighted the film among valuable comedy contributions to the discussion of climate change, and called it a "poignant video".&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{citation|accessdate=April 9, 2016|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/19/peoples-climate-march-al-gore-leonardo-dicaprio-climate-change|work=[[The Guardian]]|title= Handle with humor: why we want you to laugh about climate change |first=Travis|last=Irvine|date=June 19, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151215130007/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/19/peoples-climate-march-al-gore-leonardo-dicaprio-climate-change|archivedate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsay Abrams of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' wrote: "What I like so much about Funny or Die's parody PSA about ''Climate Change Denial Disorder'' is that, aside from medicalizing what in actuality is just willful ignorance, it’s pretty spot-on."&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{citation|accessdate=April 9, 2016|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=April 15, 2015|title='I’m gonna wait til more horrible sh*t happens to our planet'|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/04/15/im_gonna_wait_til_more_horrible_sht_happens_to_our_planet_funny_or_die_psa_skewers_congressional_climate_deniers/|first=Lindsay|last=Abrams|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024094912/http://www.salon.com/2015/04/15/im_gonna_wait_til_more_horrible_sht_happens_to_our_planet_funny_or_die_psa_skewers_congressional_climate_deniers/|archivedate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abrams lamented that the Senator's pronouncement in the film against any action on climate change was: "all the more difficult to hear knowing that the vast majority of all Americans — including half of Republicans — support government action on climate change."&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt;

''[[The Huffington Post]]'' reporter Ron Dicker wrote of the uncomfortable comedic message in the film: "it seems those who suffer from CCDD are pretty insufferable. Go ahead and laugh — but not too much."&lt;ref name="rondicker"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/15/climate-change-denial-disorder_n_7070992.html|accessdate=April 9, 2016|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=April 15, 2015|first=Ron|last=Dicker|title='Climate Change Denial Disorder' Is Kind Of Real|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311234603/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/15/climate-change-denial-disorder_n_7070992.html|archivedate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Huffington Post'' journalists Liat Kornowski and Kate Bratskeir highlighted the film in their segment on the best comedic pieces from the prior week, commenting: "Global warming is apparently melting our brains."&lt;ref name="kornowski"&gt;{{citation|first1=Liat|last1=Kornowski|first2=Kate|last2=Bratskeir|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/18/the-morning-email_n_7080628.html|accessdate=April 9, 2016|date=April 18, 2015|title=Saturday's Morning Email: Funnies Edition|archivedate=October 31, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031010031/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/18/the-morning-email_n_7080628.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biologist]] Mary Ellen Harte of ''The Huffington Post'' shared her take on several satirical pieces related to climate change, and called the film "absolutely hilarious".&lt;ref name="harte"&gt;{{citation|accessdate=April 9, 2016|first=Mary Ellen|last=Harte|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|title=

'''Common Ground''' is a nonprofit affordable housing developer   in [[Seattle, Washington]].  Its primary goal is creating and preserving high-quality permanent and transitional housing for the homeless;   it  now also includes nonprofit facilities other than housing, such as community centers and medical buildings.  The core of the organization are housing development specialists, who work together with existing nonprofit social service agencies, government agencies and housing authorities.

== History ==
 
In 1980, county planner Steve Clagett and other housing activists founded Common Ground in response to a growing housing crisis in the downtown core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000930&amp;slug=4045272| title= Buildt for good| work=Seattle Times | date=2000-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The   organization   began helping local social service agencies and churches preserve and transform historic buildings into affordable housing, and   identified sites and secured funding for new affordable housing units.  The group helped preserve many downtown Seattle landmarks, including the Olive Tower, the St. Regis Hotel and the Josephinum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000930&amp;slug=4045272| title= Buildt for good| work=Seattle Times | date=2000-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19901224&amp;slug=1111127| title= Common Ground -- Developers Make Low-Income Housing Their No. 1 Priority| work=Seattle Times | date=1990-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

The organization does not own or manage   these facilities. Instead, like market-rate real estate developers, it puts together land deals, arranges financing and supervises construction for   social service agencies and housing authorities. Clients include the Metro [[YMCA]], Pioneer Human Services, [[Solid Ground (Seattle)|Solid Ground]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nationaldevelopmentcouncil.org/blog/?tag=common-ground| title= Affordable Housing Project in Seattle Breaks Ground – In One of the City’s Most Desirable Neighborhoods| work=National Development Council | date=2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Downtown Emergency Service Center]].

In the late 80s, they started to work with churches to provide housing for individuals with mental illness, establishing partnerships between mental health agencies and area churches. The churches   rented houses to be used as [[group homes]] and the agency staff provided services and oversight.  The experience led the organization into a   new area of focus: special-needs housing.

Today, Common Ground has expanded  throughout the state of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], working  with more than 300 community-based organizations to develop more than 6,200 units of housing for people with low-income or special needs.

'''''Country of My Skull''''' is a 1998 nonfiction book by [[Antjie Krog]] primarily about the findings of the South African [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC).&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/05/30/reviews/990530.30hardint.html "Picking Up the Pieces" (May 30, 1999) ''New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The book is, in reality, an intersectional, interdisciplinary analysis of the Commission's potential and realized effects on post-[[Apartheid]] [[South Africa]].  

The book can be understood as having three main elements:  First, it is a collection of accounts from the TRC hearings - direct testimony of the terrible human rights violations on all sides of the struggle against Apartheid.  Second, it is an exploration and analysis of political and moral philosophy relevant to, inspired by, and grounded in the TRC (see President [[Nelson Mandela]] and Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]]).  Third, it is biographical, in terms of the author being extremely honest, open, and self-analytical about her own position and experience relative to the TRC - racially as a white [[Afrikaner]], professionally as a radio journalist, emotionally as someone grappling with her nation's bloody past, and personally as her experiences covering the TRC affect her intimate life.

''Country of My Skull'' is written as an amalgamation of journalism, prose, personal narrative, and poetry - all of which Krog has been celebrated for - with the goal of capturing the overwhelming moral, emotional, and historical complexity of the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa.

In 2004, the book was adapted into the film ''[[In My Country]]'' by director [[John Boorman]] starring [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Juliette Binoche]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7533">{{About|the British creationist organisation|the movement called 'Creation Science' or 'Scientific Creationism'|Creation Science}}
The '''Creation Science Movement''' ('''CSM''', founded in 1932 as the '''Evolution Protest Movement''') is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Creationism|Creationist]] organisation which lays claim to the title "the oldest creationist movement in the world". It was a member of the [[Evangelical Alliance]] until its resignation in 2008, and is a registered charity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.csm.org.uk/whoweare.html Who we are], Creation Science Movement&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Evolution Protest Movement (EPM) had its roots in the [[Victoria Institute]] (or Philosophical Society of Great Britain) whose stated objective was to defend "the great truths revealed in Holy Scripture ... against the opposition of Science falsely so called." Although the Victoria Institute was not officially opposed to evolution, it attracted a number of scientists sceptical of [[Darwinism]]. It had its heyday in the late 19th century, but by the 1910s had shrunk considerably, and considerable apathy had set in. Prominent Canadian creationist (and long-standing institute member) [[George McCready Price]], attended meetings regularly while living in London between 1924 and 1928, but his views failed to persuade the membership.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p162-163&lt;/ref&gt; Before returning to North America, Price noted that British creationists were "scattered and divided into a number of small, weak, and insignificant groups or societies", and called for them to unify.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p166&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932 decorated submariner turned free-lance journalist [[Bernard Acworth]] proposed the formation of an anti-evolution society that would confine itself "as far as that might be possible, to the scientific rather  than  to the philosophic and religious plane". The proposal was seconded by [[barrister]] and amateur [[ornithologist]] [[Douglas Dewar]], and the Evolution Protest Movement was formed at a meeting between them and five like-minded conservative evangelicals with [[electrical engineer]], [[physicist]] and Victoria Institute president [[John Ambrose Fleming]] as president, Acworth as chairman and Dewar as secretary-treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p169-172&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPM existed as only a paper organisation until it was publicly launched in February 1935, at a meeting attended by over six hundred. In its early years, Dewar was the main driving force within the EPM, publishing a booklet entitled ''Man: A Special Creation'' and engaging in public speaking and debates with supporters of evolution. In the late 1930s he resisted the American creationists call for acceptance of [[flood geology]]. Dewars association with the EPM was to span a quarter century, and saw it grow to about two hundred members, with small branches in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. However it failed to win the public endorsement of [[C.S. Lewis]], the most prominent [[Christian apologist]] of his day (and a personal friend of Acworth's), though he privately admitted to finding their arguments increasingly compelling.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p172-175; footnote 26 p488&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1950s the EPM came under control of schoolmaster/pastor Albert G. Tilney, whose dogmatic and authoritarian style ran the organisation "as a one-man band", unwaveringly promoting [[Gap creationism]] and reducing the membership to lethargic inactivity. Entomologist [[William R. Thompson]] described it as "largely ignored or ridiculed by both the scientific and ecclesiastical establishments", and several prominent Creationists declined to serve as officers.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p355-356&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the recent publication of an English edition of ''[[The Genesis Flood]]'', the EPM's rejection of [[flood geology]], and Tilney's idiosyncratic scriptural interpretations, led to the formation of rival creationist groups such as the Newton Scientific Association and the Biblical Creation Society. During this time the EPM came to grudging acceptance of flood geology, and a number of [[Young Earth creationism|young Earth creationists]] (YEC) joined its council and moved the balance away from Tilney and his allies. It was renamed the Creation Science Movement in 1980. By the mid 1980s it had become overwhelmingly YEC, formally incorporated flood geology into their 'Deed of Trust' (which all officers were required to sign) and condemned Gap and [[Day-Age Creationism]] as unscriptural. By the early 1990s it had closed down its foreign branches, but had increased its membership considerably.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p356-360&lt;/ref&gt;

The current chairman of the CSM is David Rosevear, who has a Ph.D. in [[organometallic chemistry]] from the [[University of Bristol]], [[United Kingdom]] and was a [[senior lecturer]] in [[chemistry]] at [[Portsmouth University]]. He is a [[Young Earth creationist]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcseweb.org.uk/index.php/Main/DavidRosevear David Rosevear], [[British Centre for Science Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiananswers.net/creation/people/rosevear-d.html David Rosevear], Christian Answers&lt;/ref&gt; who when interviewed by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] has claimed that members of the public are [[Mind control|brainwashed]] by the [[Mass media|media]] into believing in [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4398345.stm |title=Would you Adam and Eve it? |format= |work= [[BBC]] News|author=Stephen Tomkins |date=1 April 2005|accessdate=}}

{{History of the People's Republic of China}}
{{Revolution sidebar}}
The '''Cultural Revolution''', formally the '''Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution''', was a sociopolitical [[Social movement|movement]] in [[China]] from 1966 until 1976. Launched by [[Mao Zedong]], then [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]], its stated goal was to preserve 'true' [[Ideology of the Communist Party of China|Communist ideology]] in the country by purging remnants of [[capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Chinese culture|traditional]] elements from [[Chinese culture|Chinese society]], and to re-impose [[Maoism|Mao Zedong Thought]] as the [[dominant ideology]] within the [[Communist Party of China|Party]]. The Revolution marked Mao's return to a position of power after the failures of his [[Great Leap Forward]]. The movement paralyzed China politically and negatively affected both the economy and society of the country to a significant degree.

The movement was launched in May 1966, after Mao alleged that [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] elements had infiltrated the government and society at large, aiming to restore capitalism. To eliminate his rivals within the [[Communist Party of China]], Mao insisted that these "[[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionists]]" be removed through violent [[Class conflict|class struggle]]. China's youth responded to Mao's appeal by forming [[Red Guards|Red Guard]] groups around the country. The movement spread into the [[People's Liberation Army|military]], urban [[Workforce|workers]], and the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Communist Party leadership]] itself. It resulted in widespread factional struggles in all walks of life. In the top leadership, it led to a mass [[purge]] of senior officials, most notably [[Liu Shaoqi]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]]. During the same period, Mao's [[Cult of personality|personality cult]] grew to immense proportions.

In the violent struggles that ensued across the country, millions of people were persecuted and suffered a wide range of abuses including [[public humiliation]], [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary imprisonment]], [[torture]], [[Penal labour|hard labor]], sustained [[harassment]], [[Theft|seizure of property]] and sometimes [[Capital punishment|execution]]. A large segment of the population was forcibly displaced, most notably the transfer of [[sent-down youth|urban youth to rural regions]] during the [[Down to the Countryside Movement]]. Historical relics and artifacts were destroyed and cultural and religious sites were ransacked.

Mao officially declared the Cultural Revolution to have ended in 1969, but its active phase lasted until the death of military leader and proposed Mao successor [[Lin Biao]] in 1971. After Mao's death and the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]] in 1976, reformers led by [[Deng Xiaoping]] gradually began to dismantle the Maoist policies associated with the Cultural Revolution. In 1981, the Party declared that the Cultural Revolution was "responsible for the most severe setback and the heaviest losses suffered by the Party, the country, and the people since the founding of the People's Republic".&lt;ref&gt;"Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China," adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on June 27, 1981 ''Resolution on CPC History (1949–81).'' (Beijing: Foreign Languages Press, 1981). p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===Great Leap Forward===
{{Main|Great Leap Forward}}
In 1958, after China's first [[Five-year plans of China|Five-Year Plan]], Mao called for "grassroots socialism" in order to accelerate his plans for turning China into a modern industrialized state. In this spirit, Mao launched the [[Great Leap Forward]], established [[People's Commune]]s in the countryside, and began the [[mass mobilization]] of the people into [[collectives]]. Many communities were assigned production of a single commodity—steel. Mao vowed to increase agricultural production to twice 1957 levels.&lt;ref name="Tang"/&gt;

[[File:Backyardfurnace5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|People in the countryside working at night to produce steel during the [[Great Leap Forward]]]]

The Great Leap was an economic failure. Uneducated farmers attempted to produce steel on a massive scale, partially relying on [[backyard furnace]]s to achieve the production targets set by local cadres. The steel produced was low quality and largely useless. The Great Leap reduced harvest sizes and led to a decline in the production of most goods except substandard [[pig iron]] and steel. Furthermore, local authorities frequently exaggerated production numbers, hiding and intensifying the problem for several years.&lt;ref name="umd"&gt;{{cite web|last=Worden|first=Robert|title=A Country Study:China|url=http://www-chaos.umd.edu/history/prc2.html|publisher=Library of Congress|year=1987|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jin1&gt;{{cite book|last=Jin|first=Qiu|title=The Culture of Power: Lin Biao and the Cultural Revolution|year=1999|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, California|pages=25–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, chaos in the collectives, bad weather, and exports of food necessary to secure hard currency resulted in the [[Great Chinese Famine]]. Food was in desperate shortage, and production fell dramatically. The famine caused the deaths of millions of people, particularly in poorer inland regions.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat1.htm#Mao|title=Historical Atlas of the 20th century|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Leap's failure reduced Mao's prestige within the Party. Forced to take major responsibility, in 1959, Mao resigned as the [[President of the People's Republic of China]], China's ''de jure'' head of state, and was succeeded by [[Liu Shaoqi]]. In July, [[Lushan Conference|senior Party leaders convened]] at the scenic [[Mount Lu]] to discuss policy. At the conference, Marshal [[Peng Dehuai]], the Minister of Defence, criticized Great Leap policies in a private letter to Mao, writing that it was plagued by mismanagement and cautioning against elevating political dogma over the laws of economics.&lt;ref name=umd/&gt;

Despite the moderate tone of Peng's letter, Mao took it as a personal attack against his leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Jin Qiu, [[#jin1|p. 55]]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Conference, Mao had Peng removed from his posts, and accused him of being a "right-opportunist". Peng was replaced by [[Lin Biao]], another revolutionary army general who became a more staunch Mao supporter later in his career. While the [[Lushan Conference]] served as a death knell for Peng, Mao's most vocal critic, it led to a shift of power to moderates led by Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, who took effective control of the economy following 1959.&lt;ref name=umd/&gt;

By the early 1960s, many of the Great Leap's economic policies were reversed by initiatives spearheaded by Liu, Deng, and [[Zhou Enlai]]. This moderate group of pragmatists were unenthusiastic about Mao's utopian visions. Owing to his loss of esteem within the party, Mao developed a decadent and eccentric lifestyle. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;Spence&lt;/ref&gt; By 1962, while Zhou, Liu and Deng managed affairs of state and the economy, Mao had effectively withdrawn from economic decision-making, and focused much of his time on further contemplating his contributions to Marxist–Leninist social theory, including the idea of "continuous revolution".&lt;ref&gt;Jin Qiu, Ch. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This theory's ultimate aim was to set the stage for Mao to restore his brand of Communism and his personal prestige within the Party.

===Sino-Soviet split and anti-revisionism===
{{Main|Sino-Soviet split}}
In the early 1950s, the People's Republic of China and the [[Soviet Union]] were the two largest Communist states in the world. Although initially they had been mutually supportive, disagreements arose after the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] and the rise of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] to power in the Soviet Union. In 1956, Khrushchev [[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences|denounced Stalin and his policies]] and began implementing post-Stalinist economic reforms. Mao and many members of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) opposed these changes, believing that they would have negative repercussions for the worldwide Marxist movement, among whom Stalin was still viewed as a hero.&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. pp. 04-07"&gt;[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. pp. 4–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao believed that Khrushchev did not adhere to [[Marxism–Leninism]], but was instead a [[revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]], altering his policies from basic Marxist–Leninist concepts, something Mao feared would allow capitalists to regain control of the country. Relations between the two governments soured. The USSR refused to support China's case for joining the United Nations and went back on its pledge to supply China with a [[nuclear weapon]].&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. pp. 04-07"/&gt;

Mao went on to publicly denounce revisionism in April 1960. Without pointing fingers at the Soviet Union, Mao criticized its ideological ally, the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]]. In turn, the USSR criticized China's ally the [[Party of Labour of Albania]].&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. p. 07"&gt;[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, the CCP began to openly denounce the Soviet Union, publishing nine polemics against its perceived revisionism, with one of them being titled ''On Khrushchev's Phoney Communism and Historical Lessons for the World'', in which Mao charged that Khrushchev was not only a revisionist but also increased the danger of capitalist restoration.&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. p. 07"/&gt; Khrushchev's downfall from an internal ''coup d'état'' in 1964 also contributed to Mao's fears of his own political vulnerability, particularly because of his declining prestige among his colleagues after the Great Leap Forward.&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar and Schoenals 2006. p. 07"/&gt;

===Precursor===
[[File:Luo Ruiqing.jpg|thumb|upright|The purge of General [[Luo Ruiqing]] solidified the Army's loyalty to Mao]]
Mao set the scene for the Cultural Revolution by "cleansing" powerful officials of questionable loyalty who were based in Beijing. His approach was less than transparent, achieving this purge through newspaper articles, internal meetings, and skillfully employing his network of political allies.

In late 1959, historian and Beijing Deputy Mayor [[Wu Han (PRC)|Wu Han]] published a historical drama entitled ''[[Hai Rui Dismissed from Office]]''. In the play, an honest civil servant, [[Hai Rui]], is dismissed by a corrupt emperor. While Mao initially praised the play, in February 1965 he secretly commissioned his wife [[Jiang Qing]] and Shanghai propagandist [[Yao Wenyuan]] to publish an article criticizing it.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. pp. 15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Yao boldly alleged that ''Hai Rui'' was really an allegory attacking Mao; that is, Mao was the corrupt emperor and [[Peng Dehuai]] was the honest civil servant.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yao's article put Beijing Mayor [[Peng Zhen]]&lt;ref&gt;No relation to Peng Dehuai&lt;/ref&gt; on the defensive. Peng, a powerful official and Wu Han's direct superior, was the head of the "[[Five Man Group]]", a committee commissioned by Mao to study the potential for a cultural revolution. Peng Zhen, aware that he would be implicated if Wu indeed wrote an "anti-Mao" play, wished to contain Yao's influence. Yao's article was initially only published in select local newspapers. Peng forbade its publication in the nationally distributed ''[[People's Daily]]'' and other major newspapers under his control, instructing them to write exclusively about "academic discussion", and not pay heed to Yao's petty politics.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. pp. 14–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the "literary battle" against Peng raged, Mao fired [[Yang Shangkun]]—director of the Party's General Office, an organ that controlled internal communications—on a series of unsubstantiated charges, installing in his stead staunch loyalist [[Wang Dongxing]], head of Mao's security detail.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Yang's dismissal likely emboldened Mao's allies to move against their factional rivals.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In December, Defence Minister and Mao loyalist [[Lin Biao]] accused General [[Luo Ruiqing]], the chief of staff of the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA), of being anti-Mao, alleging that Luo put too much emphasis on military training rather than Maoist "political discussion". Despite initial skepticism in the Politburo of Luo's guilt, Mao pushed for an 'investigation', after which Luo was denounced, dismissed, and forced to deliver a [[self-criticism]]. Stress from the events led Luo to attempt suicide.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006. pp. 20–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Luo's removal secured the military command's loyalty to Mao.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

====February Outline====
Having ousted Luo and Yang, Mao returned his attention to Peng Zhen. On February 12, 1966, the "[[Five Man Group]]" issued a report known as the ''February Outline'' ({{lang|zh|二月提纲}}). The ''Outline'', sanctioned by the Party centre, defined ''Hai Rui'' as constructive ''academic'' discussion, and aimed to formally distance Peng Zhen from any ''political'' implications. However, Jiang Qing and Yao Wenyuan continued their denunciation of Wu Han and Peng Zhen. Meanwhile, Mao also sacked Propaganda Department director [[Lu Dingyi]], a Peng Zhen ally.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]] Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lu's removal gave Maoists unrestricted access to the press. Mao would deliver his final blow to Peng Zhen at a high-profile Politburo meeting through loyalists [[Kang Sheng]] and [[Chen Boda]]. They accused Peng Zhen of opposing Mao, labeled the ''February Outline'' "evidence of Peng Zhen's revisionism", and grouped him with three other disgraced officials as part of the "Peng-Luo-Lu-Yang Anti-Party Clique".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; On May 16, the Politburo formalized the decisions by releasing an official document condemning Peng Zhen and his "anti-party allies" in the strongest terms, disbanding his "Five Man Group", and replacing it with the Maoist [[Cultural Revolution Group]] (CRG).&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. pp. 27–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early stage: mass movement==
{{anchor|Beginning}}

===May 16 notification===
In May 1966, an "expanded session" of the Politburo was called in Beijing. The conference, rather than being a joint discussion on policy (as per the usual norms of party operations), was essentially a campaign to mobilize the Politburo into endorsing Mao's political agenda. The conference was heavily laden with Maoist political rhetoric on class struggle, and filled with meticulously-prepared 'indictments' on the recently ousted leaders such as Peng Zhen and Luo Ruiqing. One of these documents, released on May 16, was prepared with Mao's personal supervision, and was particularly damning:&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those representatives of the [[bourgeoisie]] who have sneaked into the Party, the government, the army, and various spheres of culture are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once conditions are ripe, they will seize political power and turn the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Some of them we have already seen through; others we have not. Some are still trusted by us and are being trained as our successors, persons like [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khruschev]] for example, who are still nestling beside us.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This text, which became known as the "May 16 Notification" ({{zh|s=五一六通知|p=Wǔyīliù Tōngzhī}}), summarized Mao's ideological justification for the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Li Xuefeng quoted in [[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively it implied that there are enemies of the Communist cause within the Party itself: class enemies who "wave the red flag to oppose the red flag."&lt;ref name="ms46"&gt;[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The only way to identify these people was through "the telescope and microscope of Mao Zedong Thought."&lt;ref name="ms46"/&gt; While the party leadership was relatively united in approving the general direction of Mao's agenda, many Politburo members were not especially enthusiastic, or simply confused about the direction of the movement.&lt;ref name=nianyi13&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wang|first1=Nianyi|title=大动乱的年代：1949–1989年的中国 [Great age of turmoil, a history of China 1949–89]|date=1989|publisher=''Henan Renmin Chubanshe''|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges against esteemed party leaders like Peng Zhen rang alarm bells in China's intellectual community and among the [[United Front (China)|eight non-Communist parties]].&lt;ref name="ms41"&gt;[[#Mac06|MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006]]. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early mass rallies===
After the purge of Peng Zhen, the Beijing Party Committee had effectively ceased to function, paving the way for disorder in the capital. On May 25, under the guidance of Cao Yi'ou—wife of Maoist henchman [[Kang Sheng]]—[[Nie Yuanzi]], a philosophy lecturer at Peking University, authored a [[big-character poster]] (''dazibao'') along with other leftists and posted it to a public bulletin. Nie attacked the university's party administration and its leader [[Lu Ping]].&lt;ref name=mac57&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 56–58&lt;/ref&gt; Nie insinuated that the university leadership, much like Peng Zhen, were trying to contain revolutionary fervour in a "sinister" attempt to oppose the party and advance revisionism.&lt;ref name=mac57/&gt;

Mao promptly endorsed Nie's ''dazibao'' as "the first Marxist big-character poster in China." Nie's call-to-arms, now sealed with Mao's personal stamp of approval, had a lasting ripple effect across all educational institutions in China. Students everywhere began to revolt against their respective schools' party establishment. Classes were promptly cancelled in Beijing primary and secondary schools, followed by a decision on June 13 to expand the class suspension nationwide.&lt;ref name=mac59&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, pp. 59–61&lt;/ref&gt; By early June, throngs of young demonstrators lined the capital's major thoroughfares holding giant portraits of Mao, beating drums, and shouting slogans against his perceived enemies.&lt;ref name=mac59/&gt;

When the dismissal of Peng Zhen and the municipal party leadership became public in early June, widespread confusion ensued. The public and foreign missions were kept in the dark on the reason for Peng Zhen's ousting.&lt;ref name=mac62&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, pp. 62–64&lt;/ref&gt; Even the top Party leadership was caught off guard by the sudden anti-establishment wave of protest, and struggled with what to do next.&lt;ref name=mac62/&gt; After seeking Mao's guidance in Hangzhou, Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping decided to send in "work teams" (工作组)—effectively 'ideological-guidance' squads of cadres—to the city's schools and ''People's Daily'' to restore some semblance of order and re-establish party control.&lt;ref name=mac62/&gt;

The work teams were hastily dispatched and had a poor understanding of student sentiment. Unlike the political movement of the 1950s that squarely targeted intellectuals, the new movement was focused on established party cadres, many of whom were part of the work teams. As a result, the work teams came under increasing suspicion for being yet another group aimed at thwarting revolutionary fervour.&lt;ref name=mac71&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; The party leadership subsequently became divided over whether or not work teams should remain in place. Liu Shaoqi insisted on continuing work-team involvement and suppressing the movement's most radical elements, fearing that the movement would spin out of control.&lt;ref name=mac75&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, the 72-year-old Chairman Mao took to the [[Yangtze River]] in [[Wuhan]], with the press in tow, in what became an iconic "swim across the Yangtze" to demonstrate his battle-readiness. He subsequently returned to Beijing on a mission to criticize the party leadership for its handling of the work-teams issue. Mao accused the work teams of undermining the student movement, calling for their full withdrawal on July 24. Several days later a rally was held at the Great Hall of the People to announce the decision and set the new tone of the movement to university and high school teachers and students. At the rally, Party leaders told the masses assembled to 'not be afraid' and bravely take charge of the movement themselves, free of Party interference.&lt;ref name=mac84&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

The work-teams issue marked a decisive defeat for President Liu Shaoqi politically; it also signaled that disagreement over how to handle the unfolding events of the Cultural Revolution would break Mao from the established party leadership irreversibly. On August 1, the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was hastily convened to advance Mao's now decidedly radical agenda. At the plenum, Mao showed outright disdain for Liu, repeatedly interrupting Liu as he delivered his opening day speech.&lt;ref name=mac94&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; For several days, Mao repeatedly insinuated that the Party's leadership had contravened his revolutionary vision. Mao's line of thinking received a lukewarm reception from the conference attendees. Sensing that the largely obstructive party elite was unwilling to fully embrace his revolutionary ideology, Mao went on the offensive.

On July 28, Red Guard representatives wrote to Mao, calling for rebellion and upheaval to safeguard the revolution. Mao then responded to the letters by writing his own big-character poster entitled ''[[Bombard the Headquarters]]'', rallying people to target the "command centre (i.e., Headquarters) of counterrevolution". Mao wrote that despite having undergone a Communist revolution, a "bourgeois" elite was still thriving in "positions of authority" in the government and Communist Party.&lt;ref name="Tang"&gt;Tang Tsou. [1986] (1986). ''The Cultural Revolution and Post-Mao Reforms: A Historical Perspective''. University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-81514-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although no names were mentioned, this provocative statement by Mao has been interpreted as a direct indictment of the party establishment under Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping—the purported "bourgeois headquarters" of China. The personnel changes at the Plenum reflected a radical re-design of the party's hierarchy to suit this new ideological landscape. Liu and Deng kept their seats on the Politburo Standing Committee but were in fact sidelined from day-to-day party affairs. Lin Biao was elevated to become the Party's number-two figure; Liu Shaoqi's rank went from second to eighth, and was no longer Mao's heir apparent.&lt;ref name="Tang"/&gt;

Coinciding with the top leadership being thrown out of positions of power was the thorough undoing of the entire national bureaucracy of the Communist Party. The extensive [[Organization Department of the Communist Party of China|Organization Department]], in charge of party personnel, essentially ceased to exist. The [[Cultural Revolution Group]] (CRG), Mao's ideological '[[Praetorian Guard]]', was catapulted to prominence to propagate his ideology and rally popular support. The top officials in the [[Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China|Propaganda Department]] were sacked, with many of its functions folding into the CRG.&lt;ref name=mac96&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red Guards and the destruction of the "Four Olds"===
{{Main|Four Olds}}

[[File:Wanlitod.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|The remains of [[Ming Dynasty]] [[Wanli Emperor]] at the [[Ming tombs]]. Red Guards dragged the remains of the Wanli Emperor and Empresses to the front of the tomb, where they were posthumously "denounced" and burned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/arts/08iht-wanli08.html?_r=0 "China's reluctant Emperor", ''''[[The New York Times]]'''', Sheila Melvin, Sept. 7, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On August 8, 1966, the party's Central Committee passed its "Decision Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution", later to be known as the "Sixteen Points".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rrojasdatabank.info/16points.htm Decision Concerning the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution], adopted on August 8, 1966, by the CC of the CCP (official English version)&lt;/ref&gt; This decision defined the Cultural Revolution as "a great revolution that touches people to their very souls and constitutes a deeper and more extensive stage in the development of the socialist revolution in our country.":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although the bourgeoisie has been overthrown, it is still trying to use the old ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the exploiting classes to corrupt the masses, capture their minds, and stage a comeback. The proletariat must do just the opposite: It must meet head-on every challenge of the bourgeoisie [...] to change the outlook of society. Currently, our objective is to struggle against and crush those people in authority who are taking the capitalist road, to criticize and repudiate the reactionary bourgeois academic "authorities" and the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes and to transform education, literature and art, and all other parts of the superstructure that do not correspond to the socialist economic base, so as to facilitate the consolidation and development of the socialist system.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The implications of the Sixteen Points were far-reaching. It elevated what was previously a student movement to a nationwide mass campaign that would galvanize workers, farmers, soldiers and lower-level party functionaries to rise up, challenge authority, and re-shape the "superstructure" of society. On August 18, 1966, over a million Red Guards from all over the country gathered in and around [[Tiananmen Square]] in Beijing for a personal audience with the Chairman.&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar106"&gt;[[Roderick MacFarquhar|MacFarquhar, Roderick]] and Schoenhals, Michael. ''Mao's Last Revolution''. [[Harvard University Press]], 2006. pp. 106-07&lt;/ref&gt; Lin Biao took centre stage at the August 18 rally, vociferously denouncing all manner of perceived enemies in Chinese society that were impeding the "progress of the revolution."&lt;ref name=disorder2&gt;Wang, Nianyi. ''Period of Great Turmoil: China between 1949–1989'', p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Mao personally mingled with Red Guards and threw his weight behind their cause, donning a Red Guard armband himself.&lt;ref name=disorder2/&gt; Between August and November 1966, eight mass rallies were held in which over 12 million people from all over the country, most of whom were Red Guards, participated.&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar106"/&gt; The government bore the expenses of Red Guards travelling around the country exchanging "revolutionary experiences."&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar110"&gt;[[Roderick MacFarquhar|MacFarquhar, Roderick]] and Schoenhals, Michael. ''Mao's Last Revolution''. [[Harvard University Press]], 2006. p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Red Guard rallies, Lin Biao also called for the [[Four Olds|destruction of the "Four Olds"]]; namely, old customs, culture, habits, and ideas.&lt;ref name=disorder2/&gt; Lin's speeches did not specify what needed to be "destroyed" as part of this campaign; Mao believed that in creating "great disorder", the masses should organically steer the direction of the movement rather than rely on the authorities to tell them what to do.

Some changes associated with the "Four Olds" campaign were largely benign, such as assigning new names to city streets, places, and even people; millions of babies were born with "revolutionary"-sounding names during this period. Other aspects of the Red Guard revolution were more destructive, particularly in the realms of culture and religion. Various historical sites throughout the country were destroyed. The damage was particularly pronounced in the capital, Beijing. Red Guards also laid siege to the [[Temple of Confucius, Qufu|Temple of Confucius]] in [[Qufu]], [[Shandong]] province.&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar119"&gt;[[Roderick MacFarquhar|MacFarquhar, Roderick]] and Schoenhals, Michael. ''Mao's Last Revolution''. [[Harvard University Press]], 2006. p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kong Yanjin - looking north - P1060200.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Cemetery of Confucius]] was attacked by Red Guards in November 1966.&lt;ref name="Asiaweek, Volume 10"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dIMMAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=cemetery+Tan+Houlan|title=Asiaweek, Volume 10|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeni Hung"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200304/ai_n9228762 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321075615/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200304/ai_n9228762 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 21, 2006 |title=Children of confucius |author=Jeni Hung |publisher=The Spectator |accessdate=2007-03-04 |date=April 5, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During these months of transgressiveness, Red Guards from [[Beijing Normal University]] desecrated and badly damaged [[Cemetery of Confucius|the burial place of Confucius]] himself and numerous other historically significant tombs and artifacts.&lt;ref name="Asiaweek, Volume 10"/&gt; The corpse of the 76th-generation [[Duke Yansheng]] was removed from its grave and hung naked from a tree in front of the palace during the desecration of the cemetery in the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref name="Jeni Hung"/&gt;

Libraries full of historical and foreign texts were destroyed; books were burned. Temples, churches, mosques, monasteries, and cemeteries were closed down and sometimes converted to other uses, looted, and destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwistp.murdoch.edu.au/publications/e_public/Case%20Studies_Asia/tourchin/tourchin.htm murdoch edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225041328/http://wwwistp.murdoch.edu.au/publications/e_public/Case%20Studies_Asia/tourchin/tourchin.htm |date=December 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marxist propaganda depicted Buddhism as superstition, and religion was looked upon as a means of hostile foreign infiltration, as well as an instrument of the ruling class.&lt;ref name="Dan Smyer 2007"&gt;Yu, Dan Smyer. "Delayed contention with the Chinese Marxist scapegoat complex: re-membering Tibetan Buddhism in the PRC." The Tibet Journal 32.1 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Clergy were arrested and sent to camps; many Tibetan Buddhists were forced to participate in the destruction of their monasteries at gunpoint.&lt;ref name="Dan Smyer 2007"/&gt;

For two years the Red Guards expanded their areas of authority and accelerated their efforts at socialist reconstruction. They began by passing out leaflets explaining their actions to develop and strengthen socialism and posting the names of suspected counter-revolutionaries on bulletin boards. They assembled in large groups, held debates, and wrote educational plays. They held public meetings to criticize and solicit self-criticisms from counter-revolutionaries.

One of many quotations in the [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung|Little Red Book]] (''Mao's Quotations'') that the Red Guards would later follow as a guide, provided by Mao, was "The world is yours, as well as ours, but in the last analysis, it is yours. You young people, full of vigor and vitality, are in the bloom of life, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hope is placed on you ... The world belongs to you. China's future belongs to you." 350&amp;nbsp;million copies of the book had been printed by December 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Lu, Xing.  [2004] (2004). Rhetoric of the Chinese Cultural Revolution: The Impact on Chinese Thought, Culture, and Communication. UNC Press.  {{ISBN|1-57003-543-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the mechanism that led the Red Guards to commit to their objective as the future for China. These quotes directly from Mao led to other actions by the Red Guards in the views of other Maoist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roderick MacFarquhar|MacFarquhar, Roderick]] and Schoenhals, Michael. ''Mao's Last Revolution''. [[Harvard University Press]], 2006. p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the 16 Points and other pronouncements of the central Maoist leaders forbade "armed struggle (武斗, ''wudou'')" in favor of "verbal struggle" (文斗, ''wendou''), these [[struggle session]]s often led to physical violence. What started as verbal struggles among activist groups became physical, especially when activists began to seize weapons from the army in 1967. The central Maoist leaders limited their intervention in activist violence to verbal criticism, but after the PLA began to intervene in 1969, authorities started to suppress the mass movement.

On August 22, 1966, a central directive was issued to stop police intervention in Red Guard activities, and those in the police force who defied this notice were labeled counter-revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=mac124&gt;[[Roderick MacFarquhar|MacFarquhar, Roderick]] and Schoenhals, Michael. ''Mao's Last Revolution''. [[Harvard University Press]], 2006. p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Mao's praise for rebellion encouraged actions of the Red Guards.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar &amp; Schoenhals; p. 515&lt;/ref&gt; Central officials lifted restraints on violent behavior in support of the revolution.&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar126"/&gt; [[Xie Fuzhi]], the national police chief, often pardoned Red Guards for their "crimes".&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar125"&gt;[[Roderick MacFarquhar|MacFarquhar, Roderick]] and Schoenhals, Michael. ''Mao's Last Revolution''. [[Harvard University Press]], 2006. p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

In the course of about two weeks, the violence left some one hundred officials of the ruling and middle class dead in Beijing's western district alone. The number injured exceeded that.&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar126"&gt;[[Roderick MacFarquhar|MacFarquhar, Roderick]] and Schoenhals, Michael. ''Mao's Last Revolution''. [[Harvard University Press]], 2006. p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

The most violent aspects of the campaign included incidents of torture, murder, and public humiliation. Many people who were indicted as counter-revolutionaries died by suicide. In August and September 1966, there were 1,772 people murdered in Beijing alone. In Shanghai there were 704 suicides and 534 deaths related to the Cultural Revolution in September. In Wuhan there were 62 suicides and 32 murders during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar &amp; Schoenhals; p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peng Dehuai]] was brought to Beijing to be publicly ridiculed.

In October, Mao convened a "Central Work Conference", essentially to convince those in the party leadership who had not yet adopted revolutionary ideology. Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping were prosecuted as part of a bourgeois reactionary line (''zichanjieji fandong luxian'') and begrudgingly gave [[self-criticism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar &amp; Schoenhals; p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; After the conference, Liu, once a powerful moderate pundit of the ruling class, was placed under house arrest in Beijing, then sent to a detention camp, where he was denied medical treatment and died in 1969. Deng Xiaoping was sent away for a period of re-education three times, and was eventually sent to work in a [[Jiangxi]] engine factory.

On January 3, 1967, [[Lin Biao]] and [[Jiang Qing]] employed local media and grassroots organizations to generate the "[[January Storm]]", during which the Shanghai municipal government was essentially overthrown.&lt;ref&gt;Yan, Jiaqi.  Gao, Gao.  [1996] (1996). Turbulent Decade: A History of the Cultural Revolution. {{ISBN|0-8248-1695-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This paved the way for the young factory worker [[Wang Hongwen]] to take charge of the city as leader of the [[Shanghai People's Commune]], later renamed the Municipal Revolutionary Committee. In Beijing, Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping were once again the targets of denunciation; others condemned Vice Premier [[Tao Zhu]], signaling that even central government officials should not be immune from criticism.

On January 8, Mao praised these actions through the party-run ''People's Daily'', urging all local government leaders to rise in self-criticism, or the criticism of others suspected of counterrevolutionary activity. Many local governments followed Shanghai's example, with Red Guards or other revolutionary groups seizing power from the established ruling class and government organs.

In February, Jiang Qing and Lin Biao, with support from Mao, insisted that [[class struggle]] be extended to the military. Many prominent generals voiced their hostility and opposition to the Cultural Revolution. Foreign Minister [[Chen Yi (general)|Chen Yi]] and Vice-Premier [[Tan Zhenlin]] vocally incriminated the turn of events in Shanghai, accusing the movement of "destroying the party". This group of party leaders were subsequently denounced as the "[[February Countercurrent]]". Many of these rulers were criticized for trying to sabotage the revolution and fell into political disgrace thereafter.

At the same time, some Red Guard organizations rose in protest against other Red Guard organizations who ran dissimilar revolutionary messages, complicating the situation. In April, at Mao's behest, Jiang Qing attempted to organize Red Guard groups by issuing an order to stop all "unhealthy activity." On April 6, 1967, Liu Shaoqi was openly and widely denounced by a Zhongnanhai faction whose members included Jiang Qing and Kang Sheng, and ultimately, Mao himself.

The situation was quickly spinning out of control; local revolutionary activities lacked centralized leadership. As revolutionaries dismantled ruling government and party organizations all over the country, it was no longer clear who truly believed in Mao's revolutionary vision and who was opportunistically riding the waves of chaos for their own gain. By July, factional violence had become commonplace across the country. On July 22, Jiang Qing directed the Red Guards to replace the People's Liberation Army if necessary, as local Army units continued to support traditional establishment dogma. After the initial praise by Jiang Qing, the Red Guards began to break down barracks and other army buildings. This activity, which could not be stopped by army generals, continued through to the autumn of 1968.

In the central city of [[Wuhan]], like in many other cities, two major revolutionary organizations emerged, one supporting the establishment and the other opposed to it. The groups fought over the control of the city. [[Chen Zaidao]], the Army general in charge of the area, forcibly repressed the anti-establishment demonstrators. However, in the midst of the commotion, Mao himself flew to Wuhan with a large entourage of central officials in an attempt to secure military loyalty in the area. In response, local agitators kidnapped Mao's emissary [[Wang Li (politician)|Wang Li]] in what became known as the [[Wuhan Incident]]. Subsequently, Gen. Chen Zaidao was sent to Beijing and tried by Jiang Qing and the rest of the Cultural Revolution Group.

In this same year, Chinese New Year celebrations were banned in China; they were only reinstated 13 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newschinamag.com/magazine/the-new-year-that-wasnt |title=The New Year That Wasn't |last1=Huang |first1=Wei |last2=Xie |first2=Ying |date=Jan 2012 |website=NewsChina |publisher=NewsChinaMagazine |access-date=24 Feb 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224083413/http://www.newschinamag.com/magazine/the-new-year-that-wasnt |archivedate=February 24, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1968===
In the spring of 1968, a massive campaign began, aimed at enhancing Mao's reputation. On July 27, 1968, the Red Guards' power over the Army was officially ended, and the establishment government sent in units to besiege areas that remained untouched by the Guards. A year later, the Red Guard factions were dismantled entirely; Mao predicted that the chaos might begin running its own agenda and be tempted to turn against revolutionary ideology. Their purpose had been largely fulfilled; Mao and his radical colleagues had largely overturned establishment power.

In early October, Mao began a campaign to purge ruling officials. Many were sent to the countryside to work in reeducation camps. Liu was expelled from the Communist Party at the 12th Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee in September 1968, and labelled the "headquarters of the bourgeoisie", seemingly alluding to Mao's ''[[Bombard the Headquarters]]'' ''dazibao'' written two years earlier.

In December 1968, Mao began the "[[Down to the Countryside Movement]]". During this movement, which lasted for the next decade, young bourgeoisie living in cities were ordered to go to the countryside to experience working life. The term "young intellectuals" was used to refer to recently graduated college students. In the late 1970s, these students returned to their home cities. Many students who were previously Red Guard members supported the movement and Mao's vision. This movement was thus in part a means of moving Red Guards from the cities to the countryside, where they would cause less social disruption. It also served to spread revolutionary ideology across China geographically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-2PVYI4kAtQC&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Made In China: What Western Managers Can Learn from Trailblazing Chinese Entrepreneurs |author= Donald N.

==Lin Biao phase==

===Transition of power===
The [[Ninth Congress of the CPC|Ninth Party Congress]] was held in April 1969, and served as a means to "revitalize" the party with fresh thinking and new cadres after much of the old guard had been destroyed in the struggles of preceding years.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; The institutional framework of the Party established two decades earlier had broken down almost entirely: delegates for this Congress were effectively selected by Revolutionary Committees rather than through election by party members.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Representation of the military increased by a large margin from the previous Congress (28% of the delegates were PLA members), and the election of more PLA members to the new Central Committee reflected this increase.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; Many military officers elevated to senior positions were loyal to [[Yuan Shuai|PLA Marshal]] [[Lin Biao]], opening a new factional divide between the military and civilian leadership.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. Chapter 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lin Biao was officially elevated to become the Party's number-two figure, with his name written into the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|Communist Party's Constitution]] as Mao's "closest comrade-in-arms" and "universally recognized successor".&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 291. At the time, no other Communist parties or governments anywhere in the world had adopted the practice of enshrining a successor to the current leader into their constitutions; this practice was unique to China.&lt;/ref&gt; Lin delivered the keynote address at the Congress: a document drafted by hardliner leftists [[Yao Wenyuan]] and [[Zhang Chunqiao]] under Mao's guidance.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt; The report was heavily critical of Liu Shaoqi and other "counter-revolutionaries", and drew extensively from quotations in the [[Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong|Little Red Book]]. The Congress solidified the central role of Maoism within the party psyche, re-introducing [[Maoism]] as an official guiding ideology of the party in the party constitution. Lastly, the Congress elected a new Politburo with Mao Zedong, Lin Biao, Chen Boda, Zhou Enlai, and Kang Sheng as the members of the new [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]]. Lin, Chen, and Kang were all beneficiaries of the Cultural Revolution. Zhou, who was demoted in rank, voiced his unequivocal support for Lin at the Congress.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao also restored the function of some formal party institutions, such as the operations of the party's Politburo, which ceased functioning between 1966 and 1968 because the Central Cultural Revolution Group held ''de facto'' control of the country.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;

===PLA gains pre-eminent role===
[[File:Lin Biao.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Marshal [[Lin Biao]] was constitutionally confirmed as Mao's successor in 1969.]]
Mao's efforts at re-organizing party and state institutions generated mixed results. Many far-flung provinces remained volatile as the political situation in Beijing stabilized. Factional struggles, many of which were violent, continued at the local level despite the declaration that the Ninth Congress marked a temporary "victory" for the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, despite Mao's efforts to put on a show of unity at the Congress, the factional divide between Lin Biao's PLA camp and the Jiang Qing–led radical camp was intensifying. Indeed, a personal dislike of Jiang Qing drew many civilian leaders, including prominent theoretician [[Chen Boda]], closer to [[Lin Biao]].&lt;ref&gt;Qiu, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1966 and 1968, China was isolated internationally, having declared its enmity towards both the Soviet Union and the United States. The friction with the Soviet Union intensified after [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|border clashes]] on the [[Ussuri River]] in March 1969 as the Chinese leadership prepared for all-out war.&lt;ref name=m317&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt; In October, senior leaders were evacuated from Beijing.&lt;ref name=m317/&gt; Amidst the tension, Lin Biao issued what appeared to be an executive order to prepare for war to the PLA's eleven Military Regions on October 18 without passing through Mao. This drew the ire of the Chairman, who saw it as evidence that his authority was prematurely usurped by his declared successor.&lt;ref name=m317/&gt;

The prospect of war elevated the PLA to greater prominence in domestic politics, increasing the stature of Lin Biao at the expense of Mao.&lt;ref name=m321&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence to suggest that Mao was pushed to seek closer relations with the United States as a means to avoid PLA dominance in domestic affairs that would result from a military confrontation with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=m321/&gt; During his [[1972 Nixon visit to China|meeting]] with U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1972, Mao hinted that Lin had opposed seeking better relations with the U.S.&lt;ref name=m322&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Lin was confirmed as Mao's successor, his supporters focused on the restoration of the position of [[President of the People's Republic of China|State Chairman]] (President),&lt;ref&gt;This position, effectively China's [[head of state]], has been called "President" since 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; which had been abolished by Mao after the purge of Liu Shaoqi. They hoped that by allowing Lin to ease into a constitutionally sanctioned role, whether Chairman or Vice-Chairman, Lin's succession would be institutionalized. The consensus within the Politburo was that Mao should assume the office with Lin becoming Vice-Chairman; but for unknown reasons, Mao had voiced his explicit opposition to the recreation of the position and his assuming it.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

Factional rivalries intensified at the Second Plenum of the Ninth Congress in [[Mount Lu|Lushan]] held in late August 1970. [[Chen Boda]], now aligned with the PLA faction loyal to Lin, galvanized support for the restoration of the office of President of China, despite Mao's wishes to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Chen launched an assault on [[Zhang Chunqiao]], a staunch Maoist who embodied the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, over the evaluation of Mao's legacy.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attacks on Zhang found favour with many attendees at the Plenum, and may have been construed by Mao as an indirect attack on the Cultural Revolution itself. Mao confronted Chen openly, denouncing him as a "false Marxist",&lt;ref name=m332&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; and removed him from the Politburo Standing Committee. In addition to the purge of Chen, Mao asked Lin's principal generals to write [[self-criticism]]s on their political positions as a warning to Lin. Mao also inducted several of his supporters to the Central Military Commission, and placed his loyalists in leadership roles of the [[Beijing Military Region]].&lt;ref name=m332/&gt;

===Flight of Lin Biao===
{{Main|Lin Biao incident}}
[[File:Huayangpalace layers 2007 09.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Graffiti with Lin Biao's foreword to Mao's Little Red Book, Lin's name (lower right) was later scratched out, presumably after his death.]]

By 1971, diverging interests between the civilian and military wings of the leadership were apparent. Mao was troubled by the PLA's newfound prominence, and the purge of Chen Boda marked the beginning of a gradual scaling-down of the PLA's political involvement.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; According to official sources, sensing the reduction of Lin's power base and his declining health, Lin's supporters plotted to use the military power still at their disposal to oust Mao in a coup.&lt;ref name=jin&gt;{{cite book|last=Qiu|first=Jin|title=The Culture of Power: The Lin Biao Incident in the Cultural Revolution|year=1999|publisher=Standard University Press|location=Stanford, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lin's son, [[Lin Liguo]], and other high-ranking military conspirators formed a coup apparatus in Shanghai, and dubbed the plan to oust Mao by force ''[[Project 571 Outline|Outline for Project 571]]'', which sounds similar to "Military Uprising" in Mandarin. It is disputed whether Lin Biao was involved in this process. While official sources maintain that Lin planned and executed the alleged coup attempt, scholars such as Jin Qiu portray Lin as a passive character manipulated by members of his family and his supporters.&lt;ref name="jin"/&gt; Qiu contests that Lin Biao was never personally involved in drafting the ''Outline'' and evidence suggests that Lin Liguo drafted the coup.&lt;ref name=jin/&gt;

The ''Outline'' allegedly consisted mainly of plans for aerial bombardments through use of the Air Force. It initially targeted Zhang Chunqiao and [[Yao Wenyuan]], but would later involve Mao himself. Were the plan to succeed, Lin would arrest his political rivals and assume power. Assassination attempts were alleged to have been made against Mao in Shanghai, from September 8 to September 10, 1971. Perceived risks to Mao's safety were allegedly relayed to the Chairman. One internal report alleged that Lin had planned to bomb a bridge that Mao was to cross to reach Beijing; Mao reportedly avoided this bridge after receiving intelligence reports.

In the official narrative, on September 13, 1971, Lin Biao, his wife [[Ye Qun]], Lin Liguo, and members of his staff attempted to flee to the [[Soviet Union]] ostensibly to seek asylum. En route, Lin's plane crashed in [[Mongolian People's Republic|Mongolia]], killing all on board. The plane apparently ran out of fuel en route to the Soviet Union. A Soviet team investigating the incident was not able to determine the cause of the crash, but hypothesized that the pilot was flying low to evade radar and misjudged the plane's altitude.

The official account has been put to question by foreign scholars, who have raised doubts over Lin's choice of the Soviet Union as a destination, the plane's route, the identity of the passengers, and whether or not a coup was actually taking place.&lt;ref name="jin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hannam and Lawrence 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, the Politburo met in an emergency session to discuss Lin Biao. Only on September 30 was Lin's death confirmed in Beijing, which led to the cancellation of the [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]] celebration events the following day. The Central Committee kept information under wraps, and news of Lin's death was not released to the public until two months following the incident.&lt;ref name="jin"/&gt; Many of Lin's supporters sought refuge in Hong Kong; those who remained on the mainland were purged. The event caught the party leadership off guard: the concept that Lin could betray Mao de-legitimized a vast body of Cultural Revolution political rhetoric, as Lin was already enshrined into the Party Constitution as Mao's "closest comrade-in-arms" and "successor". For several months following the incident, the party information apparatus struggled to find a "correct way" to frame the incident for public consumption.&lt;ref name="jin"/&gt;

=="Gang of Four" and their downfall==
{{Main|Gang of Four}}

===Antagonism towards Zhou and Deng===
Mao became depressed and reclusive after the Lin Biao incident. With Lin gone, Mao had no ready answers for who would succeed him. Sensing a sudden loss of direction, Mao attempted reaching out to old comrades whom he had denounced in the past. Meanwhile, in September 1972, Mao transferred a thirty-eight-year-old cadre from Shanghai, [[Wang Hongwen]], to Beijing and made him Vice-Chairman of the Party.&lt;ref name="mac357"&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Wang, a former factory worker from a peasant background,&lt;ref name="mac357" /&gt; was seemingly being groomed for succession.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; Jiang Qing's position also strengthened after Lin's flight. She held tremendous influence with the radical camp. With Mao's health on the decline, it was clear that Jiang Qing had political ambitions of her own. She allied herself with Wang Hongwen and propaganda specialists [[Zhang Chunqiao]] and [[Yao Wenyuan]], forming a political clique later pejoratively dubbed as the "[[Gang of Four]]".

By 1973, round after round of political struggles had left many lower-level institutions, including local government, factories, and railways, short of competent staff needed to carry out basic functions.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; The country's economy had fallen into disarray, which necessitated the rehabilitation of purged lower level officials. However, the party's core became heavily dominated by Cultural Revolution beneficiaries and leftist radicals, whose focus remained upholding ideological purity over economic productivity. The economy remained largely the domain of Zhou Enlai, one of the few moderates 'left standing'. Zhou attempted to restore a viable economy, but was resented by the Gang of Four, who identified him as their main political threat in post-Mao era succession.

In late 1973, to weaken Zhou's political position and to distance themselves from Lin's apparent betrayal, the "[[Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius]]" campaign began under Jiang Qing's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; Its stated goals were to purge China of [[New Confucianism|new Confucianist]] thinking and denounce Lin Biao's actions as traitorous and regressive.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; Reminiscent of the first years of the Cultural Revolution, the battle was carried out through historical [[allegory]], and although Zhou Enlai's name was never mentioned during this campaign, the Premier's historical namesake, the [[Duke of Zhou]], was a frequent target.

With a fragile economy and Zhou falling ill to cancer, Deng Xiaoping returned to the political scene, taking up the post of Vice-Premier in March 1973, in the first of a series of promotions approved by Mao. After Zhou withdrew from active politics in January 1975, Deng was effectively put in charge of the government, party, and military, earning the additional titles of [[People's Liberation Army General Staff Department|PLA General Chief of Staff]], Vice-Chairman of the Communist Party, and Vice-Chairman of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] in a short time span.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;

The speed of Deng's rehabilitation took the radical camp, who saw themselves as Mao's 'rightful' political and ideological heirs, by surprise. Mao wanted to use Deng as a counterweight to the military faction in government to suppress any remaining influence of those formerly loyal to Lin Biao. In addition, Mao had also lost confidence in the ability of the Gang of Four to manage the economy and saw Deng as a competent and effective leader. Leaving the country in grinding poverty would do no favours to the positive legacy of the Cultural Revolution, which Mao worked hard to protect. Deng's return set the scene for a protracted factional struggle between the radical Gang of Four and moderates led by Zhou and Deng.

At the time, Jiang Qing and associates held effective control of mass media and the party's propaganda network, while Zhou and Deng held control of most government organs. On some decisions, Mao sought to mitigate the Gang's influence, but on others, he acquiesced to their demands. The Gang of Four's heavy hand in political and media control did not prevent Deng from reinstating his economic policies. Deng emphatically opposed Party factionalism, and his policies aimed to promote unity as the first step to restoring economic productivity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, Chapter 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Much like the post-Great Leap restructuring led by Liu Shaoqi, Deng streamlined the railway system, steel production, and other key areas of the economy. By late 1975 however, Mao saw that Deng's economic restructuring might negate the legacy of the Cultural Revolution, and launched a campaign to oppose "rehabilitating the case for the rightists", alluding to Deng as the country's foremost "rightist". Mao directed Deng to write self-criticisms in November 1975, a move lauded by the Gang of Four.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Death of Zhou Enlai===
On January 8, 1976, Zhou Enlai died of [[bladder cancer]]. On January 15 Deng Xiaoping delivered Zhou's official eulogy in a funeral attended by all of China's most senior leaders with the notable absence of Mao himself, who had grown increasingly critical of Zhou.&lt;ref&gt;Teiwes and Sun 217–218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spence 610&lt;/ref&gt;  Curiously, after Zhou's death, Mao selected neither a member of the Gang of Four nor Deng Xiaoping to become Premier, instead choosing the relatively unknown [[Hua Guofeng]].

The Gang of Four grew apprehensive that spontaneous, large-scale popular support for Zhou could turn the political tide against them. They acted through the media to impose a set of restrictions on overt public displays of mourning for Zhou. Years of resentment over the Cultural Revolution, the public persecution of Deng Xiaoping (seen as Zhou's ally), and the prohibition against public mourning led to a rise in popular discontent against Mao and the Gang of Four.&lt;ref name="TS1"&gt;Tiewes and Sun, 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Official attempts to enforce the mourning restrictions included removing public memorials and tearing down posters commemorating Zhou's achievements.  On March 25, 1976, Shanghai's ''[[Wen Hui Bao]]'' published an article calling Zhou "the capitalist roader inside the Party [who] wanted to help the unrepentant capitalist roader [Deng] regain his power". These propaganda efforts at smearing Zhou's image, however, only strengthened public attachment to Zhou's memory.&lt;ref&gt;Teiwes and Sun 214&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tiananmen Incident===
{{Main|Tiananmen Incident}}
On April 4, 1976, on the eve of China's annual [[Qingming Festival]], a traditional day of mourning, thousands of people gathered around the [[Monument to the People's Heroes]] in [[Tiananmen Square]] to commemorate Zhou Enlai. The people of Beijing honored Zhou by laying wreaths, banners, poems, placards, and flowers at the foot of the Monument.&lt;ref name="Tiananmen1" /&gt; The most obvious purpose of this memorial was to eulogize Zhou, but the [[Gang of Four]] were also attacked for their actions against the Premier. A small number of slogans left at Tiananmen even attacked Mao himself, and his Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref name="TS2"&gt;Teiwes and Sun 218&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to two million people may have visited Tiananmen Square on April 4.&lt;ref name="TS2"/&gt; All levels of society, from the poorest peasants to high-ranking PLA officers and the children of high-ranking cadres, were represented in the activities. Those who participated were motivated by a mixture of anger over the treatment of Zhou, revolt against the Cultural Revolution and apprehension for China's future. The event did not appear to have coordinated leadership but rather seemed to be a reflection of public sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;Teiwes and Sun 119–220&lt;/ref&gt;

The Central Committee, under the leadership of Jiang Qing, labelled the event 'counter-revolutionary', and cleared the square of memorial items shortly after midnight on April 6. Attempts to suppress the mourners led to a violent riot. Police cars were set on fire and a crowd of over 100,000 people forced its way into several government buildings surrounding the square.&lt;ref name="Tiananmen1"&gt;Spence, 612&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those arrested were later sentenced to prison work camps. Similar incidents occurred in other major cities. Jiang Qing and her allies pinned Deng Xiaoping as the incident's 'mastermind', and issued reports on official media to that effect. Deng was formally stripped of all positions "inside and outside the Party" on April 7. This marked Deng's second purge in ten years.&lt;ref name="Tiananmen1" /&gt;

===Death of Mao and Arrest of the Gang of Four===
On September 9, 1976, Mao Zedong died. To Mao's supporters, his death symbolized the loss of the revolutionary foundation of Communist China. When his death was announced on the afternoon of September 9, in a press release entitled "A Notice from the Central Committee, the NPC, State Council, and the CMC to the whole Party, the whole Army and to the people of all nationalities throughout the country",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/144508.html|title=People's Daily: September 10, 1976 1976.9.10 毛主席逝世--中共中央等告全国人民书 (Máo zhǔxí shìshì – Zhōnggòng Zhōngyāng Děng Gào Quánguó Rénmín Shū) retrieved from SINA.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the nation descended into grief and mourning, with people weeping in the streets and public institutions closing for over a week. [[Hua Guofeng]] chaired the Funeral Committee.

Shortly before dying, Mao had allegedly written the message "With you in charge, I'm at ease", to Hua. Hua used this message to substantiate his position as successor. Hua had been widely considered to be lacking in political skill and ambitions, and seemingly posed no serious threat to the Gang of Four in the race for succession. However, the Gang's radical ideas also clashed with influential elders and a large segment of party reformers. With army backing and the support of Marshal [[Ye Jianying]], on October 6, the [[Central Security Bureau|Special Unit 8341]] had all members of the Gang of Four arrested in a bloodless coup.

==Aftermath==
Although Hua Guofeng publicly denounced the Gang of Four in 1976, he continued to invoke Mao's name to justify Mao-era policies.  Hua spearheaded what became known as the [[Two Whatevers]],&lt;ref name = "Harding"/&gt; namely, "Whatever policy originated from Chairman Mao, we must continue to support," and "Whatever directions were given to us from Chairman Mao, we must continue to follow."  Like Deng, Hua wanted to reverse the damage of the Cultural Revolution; but unlike Deng, who wanted to propose new economic models for China, Hua intended to move the Chinese economic and political system towards Soviet-style planning of the early 1950s.

It became increasingly clear to Hua that, without Deng Xiaoping, it was difficult to continue daily affairs of state. On October 10, Deng Xiaoping personally wrote a letter to Hua asking to be transferred back to state and party affairs; party elders also called for Deng's return. With increasing pressure from all sides, Hua named Deng Vice-Premier in July 1977, and later promoted him to various other positions, effectively catapulting Deng to China's second-most powerful figure. In August, the Party's [[Eleventh Congress of the CPC|Eleventh Congress]] was held in Beijing, officially naming (in ranking order) Hua Guofeng, [[Ye Jianying]], Deng Xiaoping, [[Li Xiannian]], and [[Wang Dongxing]] as new members of the Politburo Standing Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nihaotw.com/zhuanti/16da/pages/ghls_11.htm Basic Knowledge about the Communist Party of China: The Eleventh Congress] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624082411/http://www.nihaotw.com/zhuanti/16da/pages/ghls_11.htm |date=June 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1978, Deng seized the opportunity to elevate his protégé [[Hu Yaobang]] to power. Hu published an article in the ''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]'', making clever use of Mao's quotations while lauding Deng's ideas. Following this article, Hua began to shift his tone in support of Deng. On July 1, Deng publicized Mao's self-criticism report of 1962 regarding the failure of the Great Leap Forward. With an expanding power base, in September 1978, Deng began openly attacking Hua Guofeng's "Two Whatevers".&lt;ref name="Harding"&gt;Harding, Harry. [1987] (1987).  China's Second Revolution: Reform after Mao.  Brookings Institution Press.  {{ISBN|0-8157-3462-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 1978, the pivotal [[Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee|Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee]] was held. At the congress Deng called for "a liberation of thoughts" and urged the party to "[[seek truth from facts]]" and abandon ideological dogma. The Plenum officially marked the beginning of the [[economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reform era]]. Hua Guofeng engaged in self-criticism and called his "Two Whatevers" a mistake. [[Wang Dongxing]], a trusted ally of Mao, was also criticized. At the Plenum, the Party reversed its verdict on the [[Tiananmen Incident]]. Disgraced former leader Liu Shaoqi was allowed a belated state funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew, Christopher.

At the Fifth Plenum held in 1980, [[Peng Zhen]], [[He Long]] and other leaders who had been purged during the Cultural Revolution were politically rehabilitated. Hu Yaobang became head of the party as its General-Secretary. In September, Hua Guofeng resigned, and [[Zhao Ziyang]], another Deng ally, was named Premier. Deng remained the Chairman of the [[Central Military Commission]], but formal power was transferred to a new generation of pragmatic reformers, who reversed Cultural Revolution policies almost in their entirety.

==Policy and effect==
[[File:Beijing 1968 I.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|A 1968 map of Beijing showing streets and landmarks renamed during the Cultural Revolution. Andingmen Inner Street became "Great Leap Forward Road", Taijichang Street became the "Road for Eternal Revolution", Dongjiaominxiang was renamed "Anti-Imperialist Road", Beihai Park was renamed "Worker-Peasant-Soldier Park" and Jingshan Park became "Red Guard Park." Most of the Cultural Revolution-era name changes were later reversed.]]

The effects of the Cultural Revolution directly or indirectly touched essentially all of China's population. During the Cultural Revolution, much economic activity was halted, with "revolution", regardless of interpretation, being the primary objective of the country. [[Maoism|Mao Zedong Thought]] became the central operative guide to all things in China. The authority of the Red Guards surpassed that of the army, local police authorities, and the law in general. Chinese traditional arts and ideas were ignored and publicly attacked, with praise for Mao being practiced in their place.  People were encouraged to criticize cultural institutions and to question their parents and teachers, which had been strictly forbidden in traditional [[Chinese culture]].

The start of the Cultural Revolution brought huge numbers of Red Guards to Beijing, with all expenses paid by the government, and the railway system was in turmoil.  The revolution aimed to destroy the "[[Four Olds]]" (old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas) and establish the corresponding "Four News", which could range from changing of names and cutting of hair, to the ransacking of homes, vandalizing cultural treasures, and desecrating temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GO5HrrJC_aMC&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Rhetoric of the Chinese Cultural Revolution: The Impact on Chinese Thought, Culture, and Communication |pages=61–64 |author= Xing Lu |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |year= 2004 |isbn=978-1570035432 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a few years, countless ancient buildings, artifacts, antiques, books, and paintings were destroyed by Red Guards.  The status of traditional Chinese culture and institutions within China was also severely damaged as a result of the Cultural Revolution, and the practice of many traditional customs weakened.

The revolution also aimed to "sweep away" all "[[cow demons and snake spirits]]", that is, all the class enemy who promoted bourgeois ideas within the party, the government, the army, among the intellectuals, as well as those from an exploitative family background or who belonged to one of the [[Five Black Categories]].  Large numbers of people perceived to be "monsters and demons" regardless of guilt or innocence were publicly denounced, humiliated, and beaten.  In their revolutionary fervor, students denounced their teachers, and children denounced their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GO5HrrJC_aMC&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Rhetoric of the Chinese Cultural Revolution: The Impact on Chinese Thought, Culture, and Communication |pages=59–61 |author= Xing Lu |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |year= 2004 |isbn=978-1570035432 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many died through their ill-treatment or committed suicide. In 1968, youths were mobilized to go to the countryside in the [[Down to the Countryside Movement]] so they may learn from the peasantry, and the departure of millions from the cities helped end the most violent phase of the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref name="turmoil"/&gt;

Though the effect of the Cultural Revolution was disastrous for millions of people in China, there were positive outcomes for some sections of the population, such as those in the rural areas.  For example, the upheavals of the Cultural Revolution and the hostility to the intellectual elite is widely accepted to have damaged the quality of education in China, especially at the upper end of education system.  However, the radical policies also provided many in the rural communities with middle school education for the first time, which is thought to have facilitated the rural economic development in the 70s and 80s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRr8GOrCLgkC&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Rise of the Red Engineers: The Cultural Revolution and the Origins of China's New Class |author= Joel Andreas |page=163 |publisher= Stanford University Press |year= 2009 |isbn=978-0804760782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, a large number of health personnel were deployed to the countryside as [[barefoot doctors]] during the Cultural Revolution. Some farmers were given informal medical training, and health-care centers were established in rural communities. This process led to a marked improvement in the health and the life expectancy of the general population.&lt;ref name="Huang Foreign Affairs 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/136507/yanzhong-huang/the-sick-man-of-asia |last=Huang|first=Yanzhong|journal=Foreign Affairs|title=The Sick Man of Asia.

After the most violent phase of the 1960s ended, the attack on traditional culture continued in 1973 with the ''[[Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius|Anti-Lin Biao, Anti-Confucius Campaign]]'' as part of the struggle against the moderate elements in the party. The Cultural Revolution brought to the forefront numerous internal power struggles within the Communist party, many of which had little to do with the larger battles between Party leaders, but resulted instead from local factionalism and petty rivalries that were usually unrelated to the "revolution" itself.  Because of the chaotic political environment, local governments lacked organization and stability, if they existed at all. Members of different factions often fought on the streets, and political assassinations, particularly in predominantly rural provinces, were common. The masses spontaneously involved themselves in factions, and took part in open warfare against other factions. The ideology that drove these factions was vague and sometimes non-existent, with the struggle for local authority being the only motivation for mass involvement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Education===

The Cultural Revolution brought China's education system to a virtual halt for some time. In the early months of the Cultural Revolution, schools and universities were closed.  Primary and middle schools later gradually reopened, but all colleges and universities were closed until 1970, and most universities did not reopen until 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRr8GOrCLgkC&amp;pg=PA164#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Rise of the Red Engineers: The Cultural Revolution and the Origins of China's New Class |author= Joel Andreas |page=164 |publisher= Stanford University Press |year= 2009 |isbn=978-0804760782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The university entrance exams were cancelled after 1966, to be replaced later by a system whereby students were recommended by factories, villages and military units, and entrance exams were not restored until 1977 under Deng Xiaoping. According to the documents for the prosecution of the Gang of Four, 142,000 cadres and teachers in the education circles were persecuted, and noted academics, scientists, and educators who died included [[Xiong Qinglai]], [[Jian Bozan]], [[Rao Yutai]], [[Wu Dingliang]] and [[Zhao Jiuzhang]].&lt;ref name="documents"/&gt;

Many [[intellectual]]s were sent to rural labor camps, and many of those who survived left China shortly after the revolution ended.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Many survivors and observers{{Who|date=July 2010}} suggest that almost anyone with skills over that of the average person was made the target of political "struggle" in some way.  The entire generation of tormented and inadequately educated individuals is often referred to in the West as well as in China as the 'lost generation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GO5HrrJC_aMC&amp;pg=PA195#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Rhetoric of the Chinese Cultural Revolution: The Impact on Chinese Thought, Culture, and Communication |author= Xing Lu |page=195 |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |year= 2004 |isbn=978-1570035432 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YFkx41kszGUC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A River Forever Flowing: Cross-cultural Lives and Identities in the Multicultural Landscape |author= Ming Fang He |page=55 |publisher= Information Age Publishing|date= 2000|isbn=978-1593110765 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/24/world/asia/china-lost-generation/ |title=China's 'lost generation' recall hardships of Cultural Revolution|author= Tracy You |work= CNN |date=October 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cultural Revolution, basic education was emphasized and rapidly expanded. While the years of schooling were reduced and education standard fell, the proportion of Chinese children who had completed primary education increased from less than half before the Cultural Revolution to almost all after the Cultural Revolution, and those who completed junior middle school rose from 15% to over two-third.  The educational opportunities for rural children expanded considerably, while those of the children of the urban elite became restricted by the anti-elitist policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRr8GOrCLgkC&amp;pg=PA166#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Rise of the Red Engineers: The Cultural Revolution and the Origins of China's New Class |author= Joel Andreas |pages=166–67 |publisher= Stanford University Press |year= 2009 |isbn=978-0804760782 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of the Cultural Revolution on popular education varied among regions, and formal measurements of literacy did not resume until the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;Peterson, Glen. [1997] (1997). The Power of Words: literacy and revolution in South China, 1949–95.  UBC Press. {{ISBN|0-7748-0612-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some counties in [[Zhanjiang]] had illiteracy rates as high as 41% some 20 years after the revolution.  The leaders of China at the time denied that there were any illiteracy problems from the start.  This effect was amplified by the elimination of qualified teachers—many districts were forced to rely on selected students to educate the next generation.&lt;ref name="Peterson" /&gt;

In 1968, the Communist Party instituted the [[Down to the Countryside Movement]], in which [[sent-down youth|"Educated Youths"]] (''zhishi qingnian'' or simply ''zhiqing'') in urban areas were sent to live and work in agrarian areas to be re-educated by the peasantry and to better understand the role of manual agrarian labor in Chinese society. In the initial stages, most of the youth who took part volunteered, although later on the government resorted to forcing many of them to move.  Between 1968 and 1979, 17 millions of China's urban youths left for the countryside, and being in the rural areas also deprived them the opportunity of higher education.&lt;ref name="turmoil"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XbapwCJRtdUC&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false King. p. 10]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the post-Mao period, many of those forcibly moved attacked the policy as a violation of their human rights."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slogans and rhetoric===
[[File:Cultural revolution anhui.jpg|thumb|right|Remnants of a banner containing slogans from the Cultural Revolution in [[Anhui]].]]
According to Shaorong Huang, the fact that the Cultural Revolution had such massive effects on Chinese society is the result of extensive use of political slogans.&lt;ref name=huang&gt;Huang, Shaorong. "The power of Words: Political Slogans as Leverage in Conflict and Conflict Management during China's Cultural Revolution Movement," in Chinese Conflict Management and Resolution,  by Guo-Ming Chen and Ringo Ma (2001), Greenwood Publishing Group&lt;/ref&gt; In Huang's view, rhetoric played a central role in rallying both the Party leadership and people at large during the Cultural Revolution. For example, the slogan "to rebel is justified" (造反有理, zàofǎn yǒulǐ) became a unitary theme.&lt;ref name=huang/&gt;

Huang asserts that political slogans were ubiquitous in every aspect of people's lives, being printed onto ordinary items such as bus tickets, cigarette packets, and mirror tables.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Workers were supposed to "grasp revolution and promote productions", while peasants were supposed to raise more pigs because "more pigs means more manure, and more manure means more grain". Even a casual remark by Mao, "Sweet potato tastes good; I like it" became a slogan everywhere in the countryside.&lt;ref name=huang/&gt;

Political slogans of the time had three sources: Mao, official Party media such as ''[[People's Daily]]'', and the Red Guards.&lt;ref name=huang/&gt;  Mao often offered vague, yet powerful directives that led to the factionalization of the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]].&lt;ref&gt;Chan&lt;/ref&gt; These directives could be interpreted to suit personal interests, in turn aiding factions' goals in being most loyal to [[Mao Zedong]]. Red Guard slogans were of the most violent nature, such as "Strike the enemy down on the floor and step on him with a foot", "Long live the red terror!" and "Those who are against Chairman Mao will have their dog skulls smashed into pieces".&lt;ref name=huang/&gt;

Sinologists Lowell Dittmer and Chen Ruoxi point out that the Chinese language had historically been defined by subtlety, delicacy, moderation, and honesty, as well as the "cultivation of a refined and elegant literary style".&lt;ref name=dittmerchen&gt;Dittmer, Lowel and Chen Ruoxi. (1981) "Ethics and rhetoric of the Chinese Cultural Revolution," Studies in Chinese Terminology, 19, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; This changed during the Cultural Revolution. Since Mao wanted an army of bellicose people in his crusade, rhetoric at the time was reduced to militant and violent vocabulary.&lt;ref name=huang/&gt; These slogans were a powerful and effective method of "thought reform", mobilizing millions of people in a concerted attack upon the subjective world, "while at the same time reforming their objective world."&lt;ref name=huang/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dittmer and Chen 1981, p. 12"&gt;Dittmer and Chen 1981, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dittmer and Chen argue that the emphasis on politics made language a very effective form of propaganda, but "also transformed it into a jargon of stereotypes—pompous, repetitive, and boring".&lt;ref name="Dittmer and Chen 1981, p. 12"/&gt; To distance itself from the era, Deng Xiaoping's government cut back heavily on the use of political slogans. The practice of sloganeering saw a mild resurgence in the late 1990s under [[Jiang Zemin]].

===Arts and literature===
[[File:Revolutionary opera.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The ballet ''[[Red Detachment of Women (ballet)|The Red Detachment of Women]]'', one of the Model Dramas promoted during the Cultural Revolution.]]
Before the Cultural Revolution, in the years 1958–1966, theatre became part of the struggles in the political arena as plays were used as to criticize or support particular members of the party leadership.  An opera by [[Wu Han (historian)|Wu Han]], ''[[Hai Rui Dismissed from Office]]'', was interpreted as a veiled criticism of Mao. It produced an attack by Yao Wenyuan on the opera, an attack often considered the opening shot of Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7zFiHwkpo88C&amp;pg=PA236#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Contemporary Chinese Historical Drama: Four Studies |author= Rudolf G. Wagner |page=236 |publisher=University of California Press|edition =1st |year= 1990 |isbn=978-0520059542 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It would lead to the persecution and death of its writer Wu Han, as well as others involved in theatre, such as [[Tian Han]], [[Sun Weishi]], and [[Zhou Xinfang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3o_Ujqw4Kh0C&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Using the Past to Serve the Present: Historiography and Politics in Contemporary China |editor= by Jonathan Unger |publisher=M.E.

During the Cultural Revolution, Jiang Qing took control of the stage and introduced the [[Revolutionary opera|revolutionary model operas]] under her direct supervision. Traditional operas were banned as they were considered feudalistic and bourgeois, but revolutionary opera, which is based on [[Peking opera]] but modified in both content and form, was promoted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GO5HrrJC_aMC&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Rhetoric of the Chinese Cultural Revolution: The Impact on Chinese Thought, Culture, and Communication |author= Xing Lu |page=115 |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |year= 2004 |isbn=978-1570035432 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1967, eight [[Model operas|Model Dramas]] (6 operas and 2 ballets) were produced in the first three years, and the most notable of the operas was ''[[The Legend of the Red Lantern]]''.  These operas were the only approved opera form and other opera troupes were required to adopt or change their repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XbapwCJRtdUC&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false King. p. 176]&lt;/ref&gt;  The model operas were also broadcast on the radio, made into films, blared from public loudspeakers, taught to students in schools and workers in factories, and became ubiquitous as a form of popular entertainment and the only theatrical entertainment for millions in China.&lt;ref name="turbulent decade"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GO5HrrJC_aMC&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Rhetoric of the Chinese Cultural Revolution: The Impact on Chinese Thought, Culture, and Communication |author= Xing Lu |page=115 |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |year= 2004 |isbn=978-1570035432 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Jiang Qing put forward the Theory of the Dictatorship of the Black Line in Literature and Arts where those perceived to be bourgeois, anti-socialist or anti-Mao "black line" should be cast aside, and called for the creation of a new literature and arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bNooFMV12sC&amp;pg=PA352#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Turbulent Decade: A History of the Cultural Revolution |author1=Jiaqi Yan |author2=Gao Gao |pages=352–53 |publisher= University of Hawai'i Press |edition= 1st |year= 1996 |isbn=978-0824816957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writers, artists and intellectuals who were the recipients and disseminators of the "old culture" would be comprehensively eradicated.  The majority of writers and artists were seen as "black line figures" and "reactionary literati", and therefore persecuted, many were subjected to "criticism and denunciation" where they may be publicly humiliated and ravaged, and they may also be imprisoned or sent to be reformed through hard labour.&lt;ref name="hong"/&gt; For instance, [[Mei Zhi]] and her husband were sent to a tea farm in [[Lushan County, Sichuan]], and she did not resume writing until the 1980s.&lt;ref name=sina&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.sina.com.cn/s/2008-03-12/113615131996.shtml | title=张晓风：我的父亲母亲 | trans-title=Zhang Xiaofeng: My father and mother | language=Chinese | last1=Zhang 张 | first1=Xiaofeng 晓风 | website=Sina | date=12 March 2008 | access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the documents for the prosecution of the Gang of Four released in 1980, more than 2,600 people in the field of arts and literature were revealed to have been persecuted by the Ministry of Culture and units under it alone.&lt;ref name="documents"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ipHX7n55ISIC&amp;pg=PA132#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Chinese Politics: Fall of Hua Kuo-Feng (1980) to the Twelfth Party Congress (1982) |editor= James T. Myers |editor2= Jürgen Domes |editor3= Erik von Groeling |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |year= 1995 |isbn= 978-1570030635 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many died as a result of their ordeal and humiliation—the names of 200 well-known writers and artists who were persecuted to death during the Cultural Revolution were commemorated in 1979, these include writers such as [[Lao She]], [[Fu Lei]], [[Deng Tuo]], [[Baren (author)|Baren]], [[Li Guangtian]], [[Yang Shuo (writer)|Yang Shuo]], and [[Zhao Shuli]].&lt;ref name="hong"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7C9xtFKGWEC&amp;pg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A History of Contemporary Chinese Literature |author= Zicheng Hong |translator=Michael M. Day |publisher=Brill |pages=213–14 |year= 2009 |isbn=978-9004173668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cultural Revolution, only a few writers who gained permission or requalification under the new system, such as [[Hao Ran]] and some writers of worker or farmer background, can have had their work published or reprinted. The permissible subject matter of proletarian and socialist literature would be strictly defined, and all the literary periodicals in the country ceased publication by 1968. The situation eased after 1972, more writers were allowed to write and many provincial literary periodicals resumed publication, but the majority of writers still could not work.&lt;ref name="hong"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7C9xtFKGWEC&amp;pg=PA219#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A History of Contemporary Chinese Literature |author= Zicheng Hong |translator=Michael M. Day |publisher=Brill |pages=219–20 |year= 2009 |isbn=978-9004173668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect is similar in the film industry. A booklet titled "Four Hundred Films to be Criticized" was distributed, and film directors and actors/actresses were criticized with some tortured and imprisoned.&lt;ref name="turbulent decade"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bNooFMV12sC&amp;pg=PA401#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Turbulent Decade: A History of the Cultural Revolution |author1=Jiaqi Yan |author2=Gao Gao |pages=401–02 |publisher= University of Hawai'i Press |edition= 1st |year= 1996 |isbn=978-0824816957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These included many of Jiang Qing's rivals and former friends in the film industry, and those who died in the period included [[Cai Chusheng]], [[Zheng Junli]], [[Shangguan Yunzhu]], [[Wang Ying (actress)|Wang Ying]], and [[Xu Lai (actress)|Xu Lai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XNyF4a7xHsC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=China on Film: A Century of Exploration, Confrontation, and Controversy |author= Paul G.

After the communist takeover in China, much of the popular music from Shanghai was condemned as [[Yellow Music]] and banned, and during the Cultural Revolution, composers of such popular music such as [[Li Jinhui]] were persecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wiQJmCxVICcC&amp;pg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Jazz Planet |editor= E.

"The East Is Red", especially, became popular; it ''de facto'' supplanted "[[March of the Volunteers|The March of the Volunteers]]" as the national anthem of China, though the latter was restored to its previous place after the Cultural Revolution ended.

====Propaganda art====
[[File:SZ 深圳博物館 Shenzhen Museum 深圳改革開放前歷史展廳 Before Reform and Opening-up History Exhibition Hall 文革時代紅色思想宣傳海布 political posters IX1 03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Posters from the Cultural Revolution period]]
Some of the most enduring images of Cultural Revolution come from the poster art. Propaganda art in posters was used as a campaigning tool and mass communication device, and often served as the main source of information for the people. They were produced in large number and widely disseminated, and were used by the government and Red Guards to educate the public the ideological value as defined by the party state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3S6mlTj1K4C&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Picturing Power in the People's Republic of China: Posters of the Cultural Revolution |editor1=Harriet Evans |editor2=Stephanie Donald |pages=1–5 |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year= 1999 |isbn=978-0847695119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were many types of posters, the two main genres being the ''[[Big-character poster|dazibao]]'' (大字报, big character poster) and "commercial" propapanda poster (宣传画, ''xuanchuanhua'').&lt;ref name="posters"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxxKXShYEJwC&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Chinese Posters: Art from the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution |author= Lincoln Cushing |author2= Ann Tompkins |pages=7–12 |publisher=Chronicle Books |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0811859462  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''dazibao'' may be slogans, poems, commentary and graphics often freely created and posted on walls in public spaces, factories and communes.  They were vital to Mao's struggle in the Cultural Revolution, and Mao himself wrote his own ''dazibao'' at Beijing University on August 5, 1966, calling on the people to "[[Bombard the Headquarters]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XxxKXShYEJwC&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Chinese Posters: Art from the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution |author= Lincoln Cushing |author2= Ann Tompkins |page=5 |publisher=Chronicle Books |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0811859462  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "commercial" propaganda posters were artworks produced by the government and sold cheaply in store to be displayed in homes.  The artists for these posters may be amateurs or uncredited professionals, and the posters were largely in a [[Socialist Realist]] visual style with certain conventions—for example, images of Mao should be depicted as "red, smooth, and luminescent".&lt;ref name="posters"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h3kDsTxGSJMC&amp;pg=PA360#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Painters and Politics in the People's Republic of China, 1949–1979 |author= Julia Frances Andrews |page=360 |publisher=University of California Press |year= 1995 |isbn=978-0520079816 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional themes in art were sidelined the Cultural Revolution, and artists such as [[Feng Zikai]], [[Shi Lu]], and [[Pan Tianshou]] were persecuted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=XbapwCJRtdUC&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false King. p. 97]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the artists have been assigned to manual labour, and artists were expected to depict subjects that glorified the Cultural Revolution related to their labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h3kDsTxGSJMC&amp;pg=PA352#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Painters and Politics in the People's Republic of China, 1949–1979 |author= Julia Frances Andrews |pages=351–52 |publisher=University of California Press |year= 1995 |isbn=978-0520079816 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1971, in part to alleviate their suffering, a number of leading artists were recalled from manual labour or free from captivity under the initiative of Zhou Enlai to decorate hotels and railway stations defaced by Red Guards slogans.  Zhou said that the artworks were for meant for foreigners, therefore were "outer" art not be under the obligations and restrictions placed on "inner" art meant for Chinese citizens.  To him, landscape paintings should also not be considered one of the "Four Olds".  However, Zhou was weakened by cancer and in 1974, the Jiang Qing faction seized these and other paintings and mounted exhibitions in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities denouncing the artworks as "Black Paintings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h3kDsTxGSJMC&amp;pg=PA368#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Painters and Politics in the People's Republic of China, 1949–1979 |author= Julia Frances Andrews |pages=368–76 |publisher=University of California Press |year= 1995 |isbn=978-0520079816 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical relics===
[[File:Trip to Ningxia and Gansu.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Faces of Buddhas were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.]]
China's historical sites, artifacts and archives suffered devastating damage, as they were thought to be at the root of "old ways of thinking." Artifacts were seized, museums and private homes ransacked, and any item found that was thought to represent bourgeois or feudal ideas was destroyed. There are few records of exactly how much was destroyed—Western observers suggest that much of China's thousands of years of history was in effect destroyed, or, later, smuggled abroad for sale, during the short ten years of the Cultural Revolution. Chinese historians compare the cultural suppression during the Cultural Revolution to [[Qin Shihuang]]'s [[great Confucian purge]]. [[Religious persecution]] intensified during this period, as a result of religion being viewed in opposition to Marxist–Leninist and Maoist thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Jiaqi Yan, Gao Gao, Danny Wynn Ye Kwok, ''Turbulent decade: a history of the cultural revolution'',  Honolulu Univ. of Hawai'i Press 1996, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Although being undertaken by some of the Revolution's enthusiastic followers, the destruction of historical relics was never formally sanctioned by the Communist Party, whose official policy was instead to protect such items.  On May 14, 1967, the CCP central committee issued a document entitled ''Several suggestions for the protection of cultural relics and books during the Cultural Revolution''.&lt;ref name="Gao 2008. p. 21"&gt;[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, enormous damage was inflicted on China's cultural heritage.  For example, a survey in 1972 in Beijing of 18 key spots of cultural heritage, including the [[Temple of Heaven]] and [[Ming Dynasty Tombs|Ming Tombs]], showed extensive damage.  Of the 80 cultural heritage sites in Beijing under municipal protection, 30 were destroyed, and of the 6,843 cultural sites under protection by Beijing government decision in 1958, 4,922 were damaged or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zDhquEq5kTYC&amp;pg=PA446&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Beijing Record: A Physical and Political History of Planning Modern Beijing |author= Jun Wang |pages=446–47 |publisher= World Scientific Publishing Co Pte Ltd. |year= 2011 |isbn=978-9814295727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnouin"/&gt;  Numerous valuable old books, paintings, and other cultural relics were also burnt to ashes.&lt;ref name="Barnouin"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1iIkALdmNIC&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Ten Years of Turbulence: The Chinese Cultural Revolution |author= Barbara Barnouin |author2= Changgen Yu |page=98 |year=2010 |publisher=Kegan Paul International, Routledge |isbn=978-0-7103-0458-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later [[Archaeology|archaeological]] excavation and preservation after the destructive period in the 1960s, however, were protected, and several major discoveries, such as that of the [[Terracotta Army]] and the [[Mawangdui]], occurred after the peak of the Revolution.&lt;ref name="Gao 2008. p. 21"/&gt; Nevertheless, the most prominent symbol of academic research in archaeology, the journal ''[[Kaogu (journal)|Kaogu]]'', did not publish during the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Asian history'', Volume 21, 1987, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Struggle sessions and purges===
{{Main|Struggle session}}
Millions of people in China were violently persecuted during the Cultural Revolution. Those identified as spies, "running dogs", "revisionists", or coming from a suspect class (including those related to former landlords or rich peasants) were subject to beating, imprisonment, rape, torture, sustained and systematic harassment and abuse, seizure of property, denial of medical attention, and erasure of social identity. At least hundreds of thousands of people were murdered, starved, or worked to death. Millions more were forcibly displaced. Young people from the cities were forcibly moved to the countryside, where they were forced to abandon all forms of standard education in place of the propaganda teachings of the Communist Party of China.&lt;ref name="Harding" /&gt;

Some people were not able to stand the torture and, losing hope for the future, committed suicide. One of the most famous cases of attempted suicide due to political persecution involved Deng Xiaoping's son, [[Deng Pufang]], who jumped (or was thrown) from a four-story building after being "interrogated" by Red Guards. Instead of dying, he became [[paraplegic]]. In the trial of the so-called Gang of Four, a Chinese court stated that 729,511 people had been persecuted, of whom 34,800 were said to have died.&lt;ref&gt;James P. Sterba, ''The New York Times'', January 25, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Mao: The Unknown Story]]'', an estimated 100,000 people died in one of the worst factional struggles in [[Guangxi]] in January–April 1968, before Premier Zhou sent the PLA to intervene.{{sfnb|ChangHalliday|2005| p = 545}} Zheng Yi's ''[[Scarlet Memorial: Tales of Cannibalism in Modern China]]'' alleged "systematic killing and [[Cannibalism|cannibalization]] of individuals in the name of political revolution and '[[class struggle]]'{{-"}} among the [[Zhuang people]] in [[Wuxuan County]], Guangxi, during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Zheng |first = Yi|year = 1996 |title = Scarlet Memorial: Tales of Cannibalism in Modern China |publisher = Westview Press| location = Boulder, Colo. |isbn = 081332615X |ref = harv}}, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Zheng was criticized in China for reliance on unpublished interviews and for negative portrayal of a Chinese ethnic minority,&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Acting the Right Part: Political Theatre and Popular Drama in Contemporary China |first=Xiaomei |last=Chen |publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2002|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; although senior party historians corroborated allegations of cannibalism.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;Roderick MacFarquhar, and Michael Schoenhals. ''Mao's Last Revolution''.

====Death toll====

Estimates of the death toll, including civilians and Red Guards, vary greatly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://necrometrics.com/20c5m.htm#Mao |title=Source List and Detailed Death Tolls for the Primary Megadeaths of the Twentieth Century |work=Necrometrics }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They range upwards to several millions, but an estimate of around 400,000 deaths is a widely accepted minimum figure, according to [[Maurice Meisner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YpV7vbvclfgC&amp;pg=PA354#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Mao's China and After: A History of the People's Republic |edition= 3rd  |author= Maurice Meisner |page=354 |publisher=Free Press |year= 1999 |isbn=978-0684856353 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  MacFarquhar and Schoenhals assert that in rural China alone some 36&amp;nbsp;million people were persecuted, of whom between 750,000 and 1.5&amp;nbsp;million were killed, with roughly the same number permanently injured.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals. p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Mao: The Unknown Story]]'', [[Jung Chang]] and [[Jon Halliday]] claim that as many as 3&amp;nbsp;million people died in the violence of the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Jung and Halliday, Jon.

The state of Chinese demographics records at the time was also very poor, and the PRC has been hesitant to allow formal research into the period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,483023,00.html ''The Chinese Cultural Revolution: Remembering Mao's Victims''] by Andreas Lorenz (Beijing) ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' Online.

===Ethnic minorities===

The Cultural Revolution wreaked much havoc on minority cultures and ethnicities in China.  In Inner Mongolia, some 790,000 people were persecuted. Of these, 22,900 were beaten to death and 120,000 were maimed,&lt;ref&gt;[[Roderick MacFarquhar|MacFarquhar, Roderick]] and Schoenhals, Michael. ''Mao's Last Revolution''.

In [[Xinjiang]], copies of the [[Qur'an]] and other books of the [[Uyghur people]] were apparently burned. Muslim imams were reportedly paraded around with paint splashed on their bodies. In the [[Koreans in China|ethnic Korean]] areas of northeast China, language schools were destroyed. In [[Yunnan]] Province, the palace of the [[Dai people]]'s king was torched, and a massacre of Muslim [[Hui people]] at the hands of the [[People's Liberation Army]] in Yunnan, known as the [[Shadian incident]], reportedly claimed over 1,600 lives in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Yongming Zhou, ''Anti-drug crusades in twentieth-century China : nationalism, history, and state building'',  Lanham [u.a.] Rowman &amp; Littlefield 1999, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Cultural Revolution was over, the government gave reparations for the Shadian Incident, including the erection of a Martyr's Memorial in Shadian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Concessions given to minorities were abolished during the Cultural Revolution as part of the Red Guards' attack on the "[[Four Olds]]". [[People's commune]]s, previously only established in parts of Tibet, were established throughout [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]] in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wksCKIivSNUC&amp;pg=PR35&amp;lpg=PR35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Historical Dictionary of Tibet|author= John Powers|author2= David Templeman |page=35 |publisher= Grove Press|year= 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; removing Tibet's exemption from China's period of land reform, and reimposed in other minority areas.

The overall failure of the Red Guards' and radical assimilationists' goals was largely due to two factors. It was felt that pushing minority groups too hard would compromise China's border defences. This was especially important as minorities make up a large percentage of the population that live along China's borders. In the late 1960s China experienced a period of strained relations with a number of its neighbours, notably with the Soviet Union and India.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Sino-Soviet split]] and [[Sino-Indian relations]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the Cultural Revolution's goals in minority areas were simply too unreasonable to be implemented. The return to pluralism, and therefore the end of the worst of the effects of the Cultural Revolution to ethnic minorities in China, coincides closely with Lin Biao's removal from power.&lt;ref name="Dreyer"&gt;{{cite book

===China===

====Communist Party opinions====
{{main|Ideology of the Communist Party of China}}
[[File:Propaganda slogan removed - Wuhan University.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|The central section of this wall shows the faint remnant marks of a propaganda slogan that was added during the Cultural Revolution, but has since been removed. The slogan reads "Boundless faith in Chairman Mao."]]

To make sense of the mass chaos caused by Mao's leadership in the Cultural Revolution while preserving the Party's authority and legitimacy, Mao's successors needed to lend the event a "proper" historical judgment. On June 27, 1981, the Central Committee adopted the "''Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China''," an official assessment of major historical events since 1949.&lt;ref name="marxists.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/subject/china/documents/cpc/history/01.htm|title=Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China (Chinese Communism Subject Archive)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Resolution frankly noted Mao's leadership role in the movement, stating that "chief responsibility for the grave 'Left' error of the 'Cultural Revolution,' an error comprehensive in magnitude and protracted in duration, does indeed lie with Comrade Mao Zedong." It diluted blame on Mao himself by asserting that the movement was "manipulated by the counterrevolutionary groups of [[Lin Biao]] and [[Jiang Qing]]," who caused its worst excesses. The Resolution affirmed that the Cultural Revolution "brought serious disaster and turmoil to the Communist Party and the Chinese people."&lt;ref name="marxists.org"/&gt;

The official view aimed to separate Mao's actions during the Cultural Revolution from his "heroic" revolutionary activities during the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. It also separated Mao's personal mistakes from the correctness of the theory that he created, going as far as to rationalize that the Cultural Revolution contravened the spirit of Mao Zedong Thought, which remains an official guiding ideology of the Party. Deng Xiaoping famously summed this up with the phrase "Mao was 70% good, 30% bad."&lt;ref name=ms&gt;{{cite web|last=Schiavenza|first=Matt|title=Does a New Biography Tell the Whole Story on Deng Xiaoping?|url=http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/does-new-biography-tell-whole-story-deng-xiaoping|publisher=Asia Society|accessdate=October 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the Cultural Revolution, Deng affirmed that Maoist ideology was responsible for the revolutionary success of the Communist Party, but abandoned it in practice to favour "[[Socialism with Chinese characteristics]]", a very different model of state-directed [[market economics]].

In Mainland China, the official view of the party now serves as the dominant framework for [[Chinese historiography]] of the time period; alternative views (see below) are discouraged. Following the Cultural Revolution, a new genre of literature known as "[[Scar literature]]" (''Shanghen Wenxue'') emerged, being encouraged by the post-Mao government. Largely written by educated youth such as Liu Xinhua, [[Zhang Xianliang]], and [[Liu Xinwu]], scar literature depicted the Revolution from a negative viewpoint, using their own perspectives and experiences as a basis.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the suppression of the [[Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989]], both liberals and conservatives within the Party accused each other of excesses that they claimed were reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution. [[Li Peng]], who promoted the use of military force, cited that the student movement had taken inspiration from the grassroots populism of the Cultural Revolution, and that if it is left unchecked, would eventually lead to a similar degree of mass chaos.&lt;ref&gt;''AsiaNews.it''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhao Ziyang]], who was sympathetic to the protestors, later accused his political opponents of illegally removing him from office by using "Cultural Revolution-style" tactics, including "reversing black and white, exaggerating personal offenses, taking quotes out of context, issuing slander and lies... innundating the newspapers with critical articles making me out to be an enemy, and casual disregard for my personal freedoms."&lt;ref&gt;Zhao 43–44&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative opinions====
Although the Chinese Communist Party officially condemns the Cultural Revolution, there are many Chinese people who hold more positive views of it, particularly amongst the working class, who benefited most from its policies.&lt;ref name="Gao 2008"&gt;[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]].&lt;/ref&gt; Since Deng's ascendancy to power, the government has arrested and imprisoned figures who have taken a strongly pro-Cultural Revolution stance. For instance, in 1985, a young shoe-factory worker put up a poster on a factory wall in [[Xianyang]], Shaanxi, which declared that "The Cultural Revolution was Good" and led to achievements such as "the building of the [[Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge]], the creation of hybrid rice crops and the rise of people's consciousness." The factory worker was eventually sentenced to ten years in prison, where he died soon after "without any apparent cause."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the student leaders of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], [[Shen Tong]], author of ''Almost a Revolution'', has a positive view of some aspects of the Cultural Revolution. According to Shen, the trigger for the famous Tiananmen hunger-strikes of 1989 was a big-character poster (''[[dazibao]]''), a form of public political discussion that gained prominence during the Cultural Revolution. Shen remarked that the congregation of students from across the country to Beijing on trains and the hospitality they received from residents was reminiscent of the experiences of Red Guards in the Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref name="Tang"/&gt;

Since the advent of the Internet, people inside and outside China have argued online that the Cultural Revolution had many beneficial qualities for China that have been denied by both the post-Mao Chinese Communist Party and Western media. Some hold that the Cultural Revolution 'cleansed' China from superstitions, religious dogma, and outdated traditions in a 'modernist transformation' that later made Deng's economic reforms possible. These sentiments increased following the [[U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]] in 1999, when a segment of the population began to associate anti-Maoist viewpoints with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chinese New Left|Contemporary Maoists]] have also become more organized in the internet era, partially as a response to criticisms of Mao from academics and scholars. One Maoist website managed to collect thousands of signatures demanding punishment for those who publicly criticize Mao. Along with the call for legal action, this movement demands the establishment of agencies similar to Cultural Revolution-era "neighborhood committees", in which "citizens" would report anti-Maoists to local public security bureaus. Maoist rhetoric and mass mobilization methods were resurgent in the interior city of [[Chongqing]] during the political career of [[Bo Xilai]].&lt;ref&gt;Ewing&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary China====
Public discussion of the Cultural Revolution is still limited in China. The Chinese government continues to prohibit news organizations from mentioning details of the Cultural Revolution, and online discussions and books about the topic are subject to official scrutiny. Textbooks on the subject continue to abide by the "official view" (see above) of the events. Many government documents from the 1960s on remain classified, and are not open to formal inspection by private academics.&lt;ref name="Fong"&gt;Fong&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[National Museum of China]] in Beijing, the Cultural Revolution is barely mentioned in its historical exhibits.&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ian|title=At China's New Museum, History Toes Party Line|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/world/asia/04museum.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=October 31, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite inroads made by numerous prominent sinologists, independent scholarly research of the Cultural Revolution is discouraged by the Chinese government.&lt;ref name="Fong" /&gt; There is concern that as witnesses age and die, the opportunity to research the event thoroughly within China may be lost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/world/asia/23iht-letter.html "A Grim Chapter in History Kept Closed"] article by Didi Kirsten Tatlow in ''[[The New York Times]]'' July 22, 2010, accessed July 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

That the government still displays such heightened sensitivities around the Cultural Revolution is an indicator that it still considers itself, at least in part, an inheritor of its legacy. The government is apprehensive that academic probing and popular discussions will lead to ideological conflict and increase social instability. It may threaten the foundations of Communist rule. The focus of the Chinese government on maintaining political and social stability has been a top priority since the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen crackdown]] on reformers on June 4, 1989, and the current government has no interest in re-evaluating any issue that might lead to a split in the Chinese leadership, or which might polarize the Party on ideological grounds.&lt;ref name="Fong" /&gt;

===Outside mainland China===
In Hong Kong a [[Hong Kong 1967 riots|pro-Communist anti-colonial strike]] inspired by the Cultural Revolution was launched in 1967. Its excesses damaged the credibility of these activists for more than a generation in the eyes of Hong Kong residents.&lt;ref&gt;Wiltshire, Trea. [First published 1987] (republished &amp; reduced 2003). Old Hong Kong – Volume Three. Central, Hong Kong: Text Form Asia books Ltd. {{ISBN|962-7283-61-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Taiwan, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] initiated the [[Chinese Cultural Renaissance]] to counter what he regarded as destruction of traditional Chinese values by the Communists on the mainland. In [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]], Communist leader and Chinese ally [[Enver Hoxha]] began a "[[Cultural and Ideological Revolution]]" organized along the same lines as the Cultural Revolution.

In the world at large, Mao Zedong emerged as a symbol of the anti-establishment, grassroots populism, and self-determination. His revolutionary philosophies found adherents in the [[Shining Path]] of Peru, the [[Naxalite]] insurgency in India, various political movements in Nepal, the U.S.-based [[Black Panther Party]],&lt;ref&gt;''Up Against the Wall,'' Curtis Austin, University of Arkansas Press, Fayetteville, 2006, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1960s [[counterculture]] movement in general. In 2007 [[Hong Kong Chief Executive]] [[Donald Tsang]] remarked that the Cultural Revolution represented the 'dangers of democracy', remarking "People can go to the extreme like what we saw during the Cultural Revolution [...], when people take everything into their own hands, then you cannot govern the place".&lt;ref name=hk&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC|title=HK's Tsang apologises for gaffe|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7042941.stm|date=October 13, 2007|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remarks caused controversy in Hong Kong and were later retracted with an accompanying apology.&lt;ref name=hk/&gt;

===Academic debate===
Various schools of thought have emerged surrounding several key questions surrounding the Cultural Revolution, seeking to explain why events unfolded the way they did, why it began in the first place, and what it ''was''. The movement's complexities contain many contradictions: led by an all-powerful omnipresent leader, it was mainly driven to fruition by a series of grassroots-led popular uprisings against the Communist establishment. While Mao's leadership was pivotal at the beginning of the movement, Jin Qiu contends that as events progressed it deviated significantly from Mao's utopian vision.&lt;ref name=jinqiu&gt;{{cite book|last=Jin|first=Qiu|title=The Culture of Power the Lin Biao Incident in the Cultural Revolution|year=1999|publisher=Standard University Press|location=Palo Alto, California|isbn=0-8047-3529-8|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the Cultural Revolution was actually a much more decentralized and varied movement that gradually lost cohesion, spawning a large number of 'local revolutions' which differed in their nature and goals.&lt;ref name=jinqiu/&gt;

Academic interest has also focused on the movement's relationship with Mao's personality. Mao had always envisioned himself as a wartime guerrilla leader, which made him wary of the bureaucratic details of peacetime governance. With the Cultural Revolution Mao was simply "returning to form", once again taking on the role of a guerrilla leader fighting against an institutionalized party bureaucracy. [[Roderick MacFarquhar|MacFarquhar]] and Schoenhals, writing in ''Mao's Last Revolution'', paint the movement as neither a ''[[bona fide]]'' war over ideological purity ''nor'' a mere power struggle to remove Mao's political rivals.&lt;ref name=rmms&gt;{{cite book|last=MacFaquhar|first=Roderick|title=Mao's Last Revolution|year=2006|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-02332-3|first2=Michael |last2=Schoenhals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Mao's personal motivations were certainly pivotal to the Cultural Revolution, they reasoned that a multitude of other complex factors contributed to the way events unfolded. These include China's relationship with the global Communist movement, geopolitical concerns, the [[Sino-Soviet Split|ideological rift between China and the Soviet Union]], Khrushchev's ouster, and the failures of the Great Leap Forward.&lt;ref name=rmms/&gt; The movement was, at least in part, a legacy project to cement Mao's place in history, aimed to boost his prestige while he was alive ''and'' preserve the invulnerability of his ideas after his death.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar and Schoenhals, ''Mao's Last Revolution'', Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

The mass hysteria surrounding the Cultural Revolution was also unprecedented. Historian Phillip Short contends that the Cultural Revolution contained elements that were akin to a form of religious worship.&lt;ref name=ps&gt;{{cite web|last=Short|first=Phillip|title=Mao's Bloody Revolution: Revealed|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd0aW-4mV68|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mao's godlike status during the period yielded him ultimate definitional power over Communist doctrine, yet the esoteric and often contradictory nature of his writings led to endless wars over its interpretation, with both conservatives and liberals drawing on Mao's teachings to achieve their divergent goals. Many factional struggles were not unlike religious wars, with all sides claiming allegiance to the most "authentic" form of Maoism.

Virtually all English-language books paint a highly negative picture of the movement. Historian Anne F. Thurston wrote that it "led to loss of culture, and of spiritual values; loss of hope and ideals; loss of time, truth and of life".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thu84-85|Thurston 1984–85]]. pp. 605–06.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnouin and Yu summarized the Cultural Revolution as "a political movement that produced unprecedented social divisions, mass mobilization, hysteria, upheavals, arbitrary cruelty, torture, killings, and even civil war", calling Mao "one of the most tyrannical despots of the twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin and Yu 217&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Mao: The Unknown Story]]'', [[Jung Chang|Chang]] and Halliday attributed all the destruction of the Cultural Revolution to Mao personally, with more sympathetic portrayals of his allies and opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Chang and Halliday, ''Mao: The Unknown Story''.&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of scholars have challenged the mainstream portrayals of the Cultural Revolution and attempted to understand it in a more positive light. Mobo Gao, writing in ''The Battle for China's Past: Mao and the Cultural Revolution'',&lt;ref name=about&gt;Pluto Press, [http://www.plutobooks.com/about.asp About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101121337/http://www.plutobooks.com/about.asp |date=January 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that the movement benefited millions of Chinese citizens, particularly agricultural and industrial workers,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and sees it as egalitarian and genuinely populist, citing continued Maoist nostalgia in China today as remnants of its positive legacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gao8|Gao 2008]]. p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving WikiLeaks, he announced plans in January 2011 to open a new website for anonymous online leaks called OpenLeaks. At a [[Chaos Computer Club]] (CCC) event in August 2011, he announced its preliminary launch and invited hackers to test the security of the ''OpenLeaks'' system, as a result of which the CCC criticized him for exploiting the good name of the club to promote his OpenLeaks project and expelled him from their club, despite his lack of membership.&lt;ref name=SpiegelAug2011&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/0,1518,780103,00.html "Hacker distanzieren sich von OpenLeaks"], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 13 August 2011.

Domscheit-Berg began working with WikiLeaks after meeting Assange at the Chaos Computer Club's annual conference ([[24C3]]) in 2007.&lt;ref name="nationalpost"&gt;{{cite news |title=Julian Assange vs. the world |first=Mark |last=Hosenball |url=https://nationalpost.com/news/world/Julian+Assange+world/3982050/story.html |newspaper=[[National Post]] |date=2010-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 25 September 2010, after reportedly being suspended by Assange for questioning him too much, Domscheit-Berg told ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' that he was resigning, saying "WikiLeaks has a structural problem. I no longer want to take responsibility for it, and that's why I am leaving the project."&lt;ref name=SpiegelSept2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-1356330/Julian-Assange-book-Inside-WikiLeaks-Daniel-Domscheit-Berg.html?ito=feeds-newsxml | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Craig | last=Brown | title=War of the WikiFreaks: Inside WikiLeaks by Daniel Domscheit-Berg | date=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wikileaksrevolt"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/09/wikileaks-revolt/ Unpublished Iraq War Logs Trigger Internal WikiLeaks Revolt|Threat Level].

Domscheit-Berg was highlighted in the [[Sveriges Television]] programme ''WikiRebels – The Documentary'', released in the second week of December 2010.&lt;ref name=svtplay /&gt;{{dead link|date=May 2014}}

A book about his experience with and separation&lt;ref name=upi /&gt; from WikiLeaks was released in Germany in February 2011, entitled  ''Inside WikiLeaks: Meine Zeit bei der gefährlichsten Website der Welt'' ("My Time at the World's Most Dangerous Website").&lt;ref name=aolnews /&gt; An English translation followed some days later by Australian publisher Scribe Publications.&lt;ref name=SpiegelAug2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=scribepublications /&gt;&lt;ref name=theaustralian2 /&gt; In Domscheit-Berg's book he criticizes Julian Assange's leadership style and handling of the [[Afghan War Diaries]].

Domscheit-Berg stated he would destroy WikiLeaks data when leaving WikiLeaks.&lt;ref name="scribd"&gt;{{cite news |title=OpenLeaks-Founder wants to destroy WikiLeaks files |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/62663100/OpenLeaks-Founder-wants-to-destroy-WikiLeaks-files}} Retrieved on 2011-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to be sure that duplicates would be confirmed deleted by a notary with an affidavit.&lt;ref name="firedoglakeAug2011"&gt;{{cite news |title=OpenLeaks Founder Destroys Cache of Unreleased WikiLeaks Documents |first=Kevin |last=Gosztola |authorlink=Kevin Gosztola |url=http://dissenter.firedoglake.com/2011/08/21/openleaks-founder-destroys-cache-of-unreleased-wikileaks-documents/|website=Dissenter.firedoglake.com |date=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In leaving, WikiLeaks state that Domscheit-Berg representing OpenLeaks, held the organisation to ransom over the unpublished documents and internal organisation communications&lt;ref name="rixstep"&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks Statement on Daniel Domscheit-Berg and OpenLeaks |url=http://rixstep.com/1/20110820,01.shtml|website=Rixstep.com |date=2011-08-20|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; with mediations by a member of the hacker collective [[Chaos Computer Club]] between OpenLeaks and WikiLeaks. Domscheit-Berg apparently told weekly ''[[Der Freitag]]'' that "I took no documents from WikiLeaks with me", leading to suspension of mediations.&lt;ref name=SpiegelAug2011 /&gt; Domscheit-Berg was eventually kicked out of Chaos Computer Club due to his conduct during the mediation and for requesting the Chaos Computer Club to test OpenLeaks' security.&lt;ref name=SpiegelAug2011 /&gt; This decision was revoked in February 2012 by the general assembly of the Chaos Computer Club.

WikiLeaks and other sources later confirmed the destruction of over 3500 unpublished whistleblower communications with some communications containing hundreds of documents,&lt;ref name=SpiegelAug2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name="firedoglakeAug2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="twitter"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Twitter |title=We can confirm that the DDB ... |url=https://twitter.com/wikileaks/statuses/105246329529319424 |date=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the US government's [[No Fly List]],&lt;ref name="wlcentral"&gt;{{cite news |title=Former WikiLeaks spokesman destroyed unreleased files |first=Heather |last=Marsh |url=http://wlcentral.org/node/2172|website=Wlcentral.org |date=2011-08-21|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5 GB of [[Bank of America]] leaks,&lt;ref name="twitterboa"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Twitter |title=We can confirm that the DDB |url=https://twitter.com/wikileaks/statuses/105244480457801728 |date=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; insider information from 20 neo nazi organizations&lt;ref name="wlcentral"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twitterneo"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Twitter |title=We can confirm that the DDB ... |url=https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/105245148065181698 |date=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proof of torture and government abuse of a Latin American country.&lt;ref name="martes"&gt;{{cite web |title=Open Letter |first=Avila |last=Renata |website=Nothingispermanent.blogspot.com.au|url=http://nothingispermanent.blogspot.com.au/2011/08/open-letter.html |date=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==OpenLeaks==
In December 2010, Domscheit-Berg announced the intention to start a site named "OpenLeaks"&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openleaks.org/content/about.shtml |title=About OpenLeaks |publisher=OpenLeaks |accessdate=28 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130215737/http://www.openleaks.org/content/about.shtml |archivedate=30 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the intention of being more transparent than WikiLeaks. "In these last months, the WikiLeaks organization has not been open any more. It lost its [[open-source model|open-source]] promise."&lt;ref name=aljazeera&gt;{{cite news |title=Copycat WikiLeaks sites make waves |first=Ben |last=Piven |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2010/12/20101216194828514847.html |newspaper=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=17 December 2010 |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of publishing the documents, Domscheit-Berg said that his proposed OpenLeaks process would send the leaked documents to various news entities or publishers.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Andy, "[https://www.forbes.com/global/2011/0117/companies-daniel-domscheit-berg-indoleaks-wikileaks-stepchildren.html WikiLeaks' Stepchildren]", ''[[Forbes]]'', 17 January 2011, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenLeaks was supposed to start public operations in January 2011. However, on 23 December 2012 Domscheit-Berg announced on the website that the organisation would not go ahead as previously intended and would now only focus on spreading information and expertise regarding how to set up and run leak websites rather than directly facilitating leaks themselves.

'''Dealul Spirii Trial''' (Romanian: ''Procesul din Dealul Spirii'') was a [[political trial]] conducted by a [[military tribunal]] in the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. 271 members of the [[Communist Party of Romania]] were accused of [[treason]] after voting for the inclusion of the party into the [[Comintern|Third International]]. The defendants were convicted and later pardoned.

The trial was the first step of the [[repression of communists in the Kingdom of Romania]]. Less than two years after the trial, the parliament voted a total ban of the Communist Party and communist ideology; for the next two decades, the government enforced a violent repression against the communists and labour unions.

A number of politicians and intellectuals, including [[Nicolae Iorga]], [[Dem I. Dobrescu]] and [[Iuliu Maniu]] voiced their discontent over the lack of constitutional basis for the trial.&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"&gt;{{cite news |title=Autoritatile pierd procesul |author= |url=http://jurnalul.ro/scinteia/istoria-comunismului/autoritatile-pierd-procesul-59114.html |newspaper=[[Jurnalul Național]] |date=October 13, 2004 |accessdate=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrests==

On May 12, 1921, the last day of the Congress of the Romanian Socialist-Communist Party, the party leaders (including [[Gheorghe Cristescu]], [[Moscu Kohn]], [[Mihai Gheorghiu Bujor]] and [[Elek Koblos]]), as well as a large number of communist sympathisers were arrested&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"/&gt; by gendarmes and police who broke into the hall.&lt;ref name="Tănase"/&gt;

They were held for eight months in miserable conditions, the detention being extremely tough for all of them, being tortured and not being allowed to have visits from the relatives.&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"/&gt; They were [[unfree labour|forced to work]] for the military, cleaning up the [[latrine]]s and the courtyards of the [[barracks]].&lt;ref name="Tănase"&gt;{{cite news |title=Procesul din Dealul Spirei |author=Stelian Tănase |url= |newspaper=[[Magazin Istoric]] |date=November 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charges==
The communists were put into a joint trial with [[Max Goldstein]], an anarchist who bombed the Senate, killing three people.&lt;ref name="Tănase"/&gt;

The charges included a large number of crimes including crime against the [[state security]], [[terrorism]], [[treason|collaboration with the enemy]] and instigation to [[riot]].&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"/&gt; The main evidence for the charges was that the communists voted for the affiliation of the party to the Third International.&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"/&gt;

[[Gheorghe Cristescu]], the leader of the party was the main defendant. Constantin Cernat, the royal commissaire, accused him of "taking an active part in preaching the abolition of the present form of government, preaching rebellion, insulting and contempting state institutions".&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"/&gt; Cernat tried to prove the links between the Socialist movement in Romania and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Tănase"/&gt;

==Trial==
Under the pretext that the courtroom was too small, the public was not allowed to witness the trial and only a small number of journalists were allowed inside.&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"/&gt;

The main defense attorney was [[Dem I. Dobrescu]], the dean of the Bucharest Bar, helped by leading lawyers including [[Osvald Teodoreanu]], [[Iorgu Petrovici]] and [[N. D. Cocea]]. The defense brought 600 witnesses, while the prosecuting attorney brought 300 witnesses.&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"/&gt; 

In favour of the communists spoke General [[Alexandru Averescu]], [[Iuliu Maniu]],the managing director of ''[[Adevărul]]'', [[Constantin Mille]]&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"/&gt; and historian [[Nicolae Iorga]] said he supported the communists' right to a fair trial and argued that the affiliation to an international organization is not an action against state security.&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"/&gt;

The defense strategy was to try to separate the defenders into people who were arrested for their political activity (the communists) and the anarchists, such as [[Max Goldstein]].&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"/&gt;

==Verdict==
All but 37 of the prisoners were convicted. Among those that were found innocent were [[Mihai Cruceanu]], [[Moscu Kohn]], [[Ilie Moscovici]], [[Elek Koblos]] and Constantin Popovici.&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"/&gt; The sentences for the Communist Party members varied from 1 month in prison to 10 years of forced labour; Goldstein was convicted to forced labour for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=La Terreur Blanche en Roumanie |author= |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k400444x/f3.image.r=L'Humanité.langEN# |newspaper=[[L'Humanité]] |date=29 June 1922 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amnesty==
The defenders began a [[hunger strike]]. As the press began revealing the abuses in the prison, two prison guards, a captain and a lieutenant, were dismissed.&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"/&gt;

Lawyer [[Take Polikrat]] wrote a letter to King [[Ferdinand I of Romania]], asking him to show his goodwill toward the defendants. An amnesty was discussed in the government, after which, it was signed by the King on June 6, 1922, 213 of the prisoners being released.&lt;ref name="jurnalul2004"/&gt; Excluded from amnesty were 48 of the defendants, who stood accused of high treason, military espionage or terrorist attacks.

The '''Extension of University Education Act, Act 45 of 1959''', formed part of the [[apartheid]] system of racial segregation in [[South Africa]]. This act made it a criminal offense for a non-white student to register at a formerly open university without the written permission of the Minister of Internal Affairs.&lt;ref name= "mandela"/&gt; New universities were established for the various non-white groups. In the [[Western Cape]], a school in [[Bellville, Western Cape|Bellville]] was established for coloureds, while a school at Ngoye was created in [[Natal Province|Zululand]] for [[Zulu people|Zulu]]s. For Indians, a school was established at Durban in [[Natal Province]], at Turfloop in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]] for the Sotho-Tswanans, while Fort Hare, the former Lovedale Mission College, became restricted to [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]]s.&lt;ref name= "mandela"&gt;{{Cite web

'''Felony disenfranchisement in Virginia''' is a provision of the [[Virginia Constitution]]: "No person who has been convicted of a felony shall be qualified to vote unless his civil rights have been restored by the Governor or other appropriate authority".&lt;ref&gt;http://law.lis.virginia.gov/constitution/article2/section1/&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor [[Ralph Northam]] will likely continue the more-or-less automatic restoration policy instituted by his predecessor [[Terry McAuliffe]], who personally signed 168,000 orders restoring voting rights.&lt;ref name="ta171024"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Matt|title=The Strangest Political Attack Ad of 2017|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/gillespie-criminal-justice-ad/543762/|access-date=January 4, 2018|publisher=The Atlantic|date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was a major issue in the 2017 Virginia gubernatorial campaign.

==History==
The 1830 Virginia constitution limited disenfranchisement to "infamous crimes", while its 1851 successor drafted by reformers added bribery and the 1870 charter targeted treason and corruption. The 1902 constitution contained a clause that disenfranchised Virginians convicted of numerous crimes, including "treason or of any felony, bribery, petit larceny, obtaining money or property under false pretenses, embezzlement, forgery, or perjury." The current constitution was adopted in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/virginia-felon-disenfranchisement/480072/|title='To Disenfranchise Every Negro That I Could'|first=Matt|last=Ford|website=TheAtlantic.com|access-date=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 June 2014, Virginia Governor [[Terry McAuliffe]] officially removed application requirements for non-violent felons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/politics/mcauliffe-restores-voting-rights-of-felons/article_e19c7a12-5c79-5ce1-aef3-027099f1e6cb.html|title=McAuliffe restores voting rights of 2,500 felons|first=Markus Schmidt Richmond|last=Times-Dispatch|website=Roanoke.com|access-date=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Offenders with "violent/more serious" felonies were required to satisfy several conditions and appeal to the governor five years after the end of completing the sentence in order to regain voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealth.virginia.gov/judicialsystem/clemency/restoration.cfm |title=VA Secretary of the Commonwealth: Clemency |publisher=Commonwealth.virginia.gov |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 2016, McAuliffe issued an executive order granting voting rights to every convicted felon in the state, violent and non-violent, who had been released from prison, on parole or probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/23/us/governor-terry-mcauliffe-virginia-voting-rights-convicted-felons.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news | title=Virginia Governor Restores Voting Rights to Felons | work=New York Times | date=22 April 2016 | accessdate=22 April 2016 | author=Stolberg, Sheryl Gay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Virginia Supreme Court]] ultimately ruled, in a 4–3 decision, that McAuliffe's executive order was unconstitutional, and that restoring voting rights must be an individualized process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/virginias-voting-rights-debacle/2016/07/26/2febf714-52a8-11e6-88eb-7dda4e2f2aec_story.html|title=Virginia’s voting rights debacle|first=Editorial|last=Board|date=July 26, 2016|publisher=|access-date=January 5, 2018|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry McAuliffe now is restoring rights to "individuals who have been convicted of a felony and are no longer incarcerated or under active supervision . . . In addition to confirming completion of incarceration and supervised release, the [[Secretary of the Commonwealth of Virginia|SOC]] considers factors such as active warrants, pre-trial hold, and other concerns that may be flagged by law enforcement. . . . The Governor will review SOC's analysis of each individual’s record and will make the final decision on proposed candidates for restoration of rights."&lt;ref&gt;https://commonwealth.virginia.gov/media/6733/restoration-of-rights-policy-memo-82216.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

McAuliffe noted that the next governor could have an entirely different policy on restoration of rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pilotonline.com/opinion/columnist/guest/terry-mcauliffe-restoration-of-voting-rights-one-year-later/article_44d23a8a-4899-593b-9a40-dde072c96f80.html|title=Terry McAuliffe: Restoration of voting rights, one year later|website=PilotOnline.com|access-date=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed constitutional amendments==
A number of amendments have been proposed to revamp the requirements for restoration of rights. In 2017, the [[Virginia Senate]] passed a constitutional amendment to permanently disenfranchise violent felons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluevirginia.us/2017/02/va-senate-republicans-pass-kim-davis-bill-constitutional-amendment-permanently-disenfranchise-ex-felons|title=VA Senate Republicans Pass "Kim Davis Bill," Constitutional Amendment to Permanently Disenfranchise Ex-Felons - Blue Virginia|website=BlueVirginia.us|access-date=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Virginia General Assembly]] being empowered to decide what constitutes a violent felony,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/politics/dp-nws-norment-felon-voting-20160901-story.html|title=Norment: Take governor, and violent felons, out of rights restoration|first=Travis|last=Fain|website=DailyPress.com|access-date=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this died in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] Privileges and Elections committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?171+sum+SJ223|title=LIS &gt; Bill Tracking &gt; SJ223  &gt; 2017 session|website=lis.Virginia.gov|access-date=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delegate [[Greg Habeeb]] had introduced a more moderate proposal than that proposed by Thomas Norment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/article_9c53d72e-d48a-53a1-b361-1b4c322c6b63.html|title=House Republicans unveil felon voting proposal with gun twist|first=GRAHAM MOOMAW Richmond|last=Times-Dispatch|website=Richmond.com|access-date=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Frankfurt Declaration''' is the general name that refers to the set of principles titled '''''Aims and Tasks of Democratic Socialism''''' issued by the [[Socialist International]] in [[Frankfurt]], [[West Germany]], on 3 July 1951.&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;Peter Lamb (editor) and James C. Docherty (editor). Historical Dictionary of Socialism. 2nd ed. Lanham, Maryland, USA; Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Oxford, England, UK: The Scarecrow Press, Inc., 2006. Pp. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration condemned [[capitalism]] for placing the "rights of ownership before the rights of man", for allowing [[economic inequality]], and for its historical support of [[imperialism]] and [[fascism]].&lt;ref name="dict" /&gt;

The Frankfurt Declaration was updated at the 18th Congress of the Socialist International in [[Stockholm]] in June 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistinternational.org/viewArticle.cfm?ArticleID=31%20DECLARATION%20of%20PRINCIPLES%20Adopted%20by%20the%20XVIII%20Congress,%20Stockholm,%20June%201989 http://www.socialistinternational.org/viewArticle.cfm?ArticleID=31 Declaration of Principles, Adopted by the XVIII Congress of the Socialist International, Stockholm, June 1989], accessed 2012-01-29&lt;/ref&gt;

It declared that capitalism has coincided with "devastating crises and mass unemployment".&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt; It praised the development of the [[welfare state]] as challenging capitalism and declared its opposition to [[Bolshevik]] [[communism]].&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;

It declared that [[socialism]] was an international movement that was plural in nature that required different approaches in different circumstances.&lt;ref name="dict" /&gt; However the Declaration stated that true socialism could only be achieved through [[democracy]].&lt;ref name="dict" /&gt;  The economic goals of socialism according to the Declaration include: [[full employment]]; the [[welfare state]]; achievement of [[public ownership]] through a variety of means, including: [[nationalization]], creation of [[cooperatives]] to counter capitalist [[private enterprise]], and/or securing rights for [[trade union]]s.&lt;ref name="dict" /&gt;

The Declaration stated that economic and social planning did not necessarily have to be achieved in a centralized form, but could also be achieved in decentralized forms.&lt;ref name="dict" /&gt;  The Declaration denounced all forms of discrimination whether economic, legal, or political must be abolished, including discrimination against women, races, regions, and other social groups.&lt;ref name="dict" /&gt;  The Declaration denounced all forms of [[colonialism]] and imperialism.&lt;ref name="dict" /&gt;

== Articles of principles of the Frankfurt Declaration ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*1. From the nineteenth century onwards, capitalism has developed immense productive forces. It has done so at the cost of excluding the great majority of citizens from influence over production. It put the rights of ownership before the rights of man. It created a new class of wage-earners without property or social rights. It sharpened the struggle between the classes.&lt;ref name="congress"&gt;Socialist International. "Aims and Tasks of Democratic Socialism: Declaration of the Socialist International". ''Socialist International, First Congress''. Frankfurt-am-Main, Federal Republic of Germany: Socialist International, 1951. http://www.socialistinternational.org/viewArticle.cfm?ArticleID=39.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Although the world contains resources which could be made to provide a decent life for everyone, capitalism has been incapable of satisfying the elementary needs of the world’s population. It proved unable to function without devastating crises and mass unemployment. It produced social insecurity and glaring contrasts between rich and poor. It resorted to imperialist expansion and colonial exploitation, thus making conflicts between nations and races more bitter. In some countries powerful capitalist groups helped the barbarism of the past to raise its head again in the form of Fascism and Nazism.&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;
*2. Socialism was born in Europe as a movement of protest against the diseases inherent in capitalist society. Because the wage-earners suffered most from capitalism, Socialism first developed as a movement of the wage-earners. Since then more and more citizens — professional and clerical workers, farmers and fishermen, craftsmen and retailers, artists and scientists — are coming to understand that Socialism appeals to all men who believe that the exploitation of man by man must be abolished.&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;
*3. Socialism aims to liberate the peoples from dependence on a minority which owns or controls the means of production. It aims to put economic power in the hands of the people as a whole, and to create a community in which free men work together as equals.&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;
*4. Socialism has become a major force in world affairs. It has passed from propaganda into practice. In some countries the foundations of a Socialist society have already been laid. Here the evils of capitalism are disappearing and the community has developed new vigour. The principles of Socialism are proving their worth in action.&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;
*5. In many countries uncontrolled capitalism is giving place to an economy in which state intervention and collective ownership limit the scope of private capitalists. More people are coming to recognise the need for planning. Social security, free trade unionism and industrial democracy are winning ground. This development is largely a result of long years of struggle by Socialists and trade unionists. Wherever Socialism is strong, important steps have been taken towards the creation of a new social order.&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;
*6. In recent years the peoples in the underdeveloped areas of the world have been finding Socialism a valuable aid in the struggle for national freedom and higher standards of life. Here different forms of democratic Socialism are evolving under the pressure of different circumstances. The main enemies of Socialism in these areas are parasitical exploitation by indigenous financial oligarchies and colonial exploitation by foreign capitalists. The Socialists fight for political and economic democracy, they seek to raise the standard of living for the masses through land reform and industrialisation, the extension of public ownership and the development of producers’ and consumers’ cooperatives.&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;
*7. Meanwhile, as Socialism advances throughout the world, new forces have arisen to threaten the movement towards freedom and social justice. Since the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, Communism has split the International Labour Movement and has set back the realisation of Socialism in many countries for decades.&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;
*8. Communism falsely claims a share in the Socialist tradition. In fact it has distorted that tradition beyond recognition. It has built up a rigid theology which is incompatible with the critical spirit of Marxism.&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;
*9. Where Socialists aim to achieve freedom and justice by removing the exploitation which divides men under capitalism, Communists seek to sharpen those class divisions only in order to establish the dictatorship of a single party.&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;
*10. International Communism is the instrument of a new imperialism. Wherever it has achieved power it has destroyed freedom or the chance of gaining freedom. It is based on a militarist bureaucracy and a terrorist police. By producing glaring contrasts of wealth and privilege it has created a new class society. Forced labour plays an important part in its economic organisation.&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;
*11. Socialism is an international movement which does not demand a rigid uniformity of approach. Whether Socialists build their faith on Marxist or other methods of analysing society, whether they are inspired by religious or humanitarian principles, they all strive for the same goal — a system of social justice, better living, freedom and world peace.&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;
*12. The progress of science and technical skill has given man increased power either to improve his lot or to destroy himself. For this reason production cannot be left to the play of economic liberalism but must be planned systematically for human needs. Such planning must respect the rights of the individual personality. Socialism stands for freedom and planning in both national and international affairs.&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;
*13. The achievement of Socialism is not inevitable. It demands a personal contribution from all its followers. Unlike the totalitarian way it does not impose on the people a passive role. On the contrary, it cannot succeed without thorough-going and active participation by the people. It is democracy in its highest form.&lt;ref name="congress" /&gt;

'''Giovanni Gentile''' ({{IPA-it|dʒoˈvanni dʒenˈtiːle|lang}}; 30 May 1875 – 15 April 1944) was an [[Italians|Italian]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Giovanni-Gentile&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.centrostudilaruna.it/giovanni-gentile-un-italiano-nelle-intemperie.html&lt;/ref&gt; neo-[[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] [[Idealism|idealist]] philosopher, educator, and fascist politician. The self-styled "philosopher of Fascism", he was influential in providing an intellectual foundation for [[Italian Fascism]], and [[ghostwriter|ghostwrote]] part of ''[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]'' (1932) with [[Benito Mussolini]]. He was involved in the resurgence of Hegelian idealism in [[Italian philosophy]] and also devised his own system of thought, which he called "[[actual idealism]]" or "actualism", and which has been described as "the subjective extreme of the idealist tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/thetheoryofminda00gentuoft#page/n11/mode/2up|title=The Theory of Mind as Pure Act|last=Gentile|first=Giovanni|date=|website=archive.org|publisher=Macmillan and Co., Limited|page=xii|others=Translated by H.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
[[File:Giovanni Gentile.png|180px|left|thumb|Gentile in the 1910s]]
Giovanni Gentile was born in [[Castelvetrano]], Sicily. He was inspired by Italian intellectuals such as [[Mazzini]], [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati|Rosmini]], [[Vincenzo Gioberti|Gioberti]], and Spaventa from whom he borrowed the idea of ''autoctisi'', "self-construction", but also was strongly influenced by the German idealist and materialist schools of thought – namely [[Karl Marx]], [[Hegel]], and [[Fichte]], with whom he shared the ideal of creating a ''[[Wissenschaftslehre]]'', a theory for a structure of knowledge that makes no assumptions. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], too, influenced him, as seen in an analogy between Nietzsche's ''Übermensch'' and Gentile's ''Uomo Fascista''.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} In religion he presented himself as a Catholic (of sorts), and emphasised [[actual idealism]]'s Christian heritage; Antonio G. Pesce insists that 'there is in fact no doubt that Gentile was a Catholic', but he occasionally identified himself as an atheist, albeit one who was still ''culturally'' a Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;James Wakefield, ''Giovanni Gentile and the State of Contemporary Constructivism: A Study of Actual Idealist Moral Theory'', Andrews UK Limited, 2015, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KPHyBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT289&amp;lpg=PT289&amp;dq=Le+ragioni+del+mio+ateismo+e+la+storia+del+cristianesimo,+Giornale+critico+della+filosofia+italiana&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qlbWtGMJCA&amp;sig=xdi2vKzQBypGcnnxswHgfU5YgCU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju_YzG-KrJAhVY1mMKHYFFCAkQ6AEIIDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=atheist&amp;f=false note 53].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Gentile, ''Le ragioni del mio ateismo e la storia del cristianesimo'', Giornale critico della filosofia italiana, n. 3, 1922, pp. 325–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

He won a fierce competition to become one of four exceptional students of the prestigious [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]], where he enrolled in the Faculty of [[Humanities]].

During his academic career, Gentile served in a number of positions, including as: 
* Professor of the History of Philosophy at the [[University of Palermo]] (27 March 1910);
* Professor of Theoretical Philosophy at the [[University of Pisa]] (9 August 1914);
* Professor of the History of Philosophy at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] (11 November 1917), and later as Professor of Theoretical Philosophy (1926);
* Commissioner of the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa (1928–32), and later as its Director (1932–43); and
* Vice President of [[Bocconi University]] in Milan (1934–44).

===Involvement with Fascism===
In 1922, Gentile was named Minister of Public Education for the government of [[Benito Mussolini]]. In this capacity he instituted the "[[Riforma Gentile]]" – a reformation of the secondary school system that had a long-lasting impact on Italian education.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Wolff, ''Catholicism, Fascism and Italian Education from the Riforma Gentile to the Carta Della Scuola 1922–1939'', History of Education Quarterly, Vol. 20, No. 1, 1980, pp. 3–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Riforma Gentile|Riforma Gentile]] on Italian Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophical works included ''The Theory of Mind as [[Actus purus|Pure Act]]'' (1916) and ''Logic as Theory of Knowledge'' (1917), with which he defined [[Actual Idealism]], a unified [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] system reinforcing his sentiments that philosophy isolated from life, and life isolated from philosophy, are but two identical modes of backward cultural bankruptcy. For Gentile, this theory indicated how philosophy could directly influence, mould, and penetrate life; or, how philosophy could govern life.

In 1925, Gentile headed two constitutional reform commissions that helped establish the corporate state of Fascism. He would go on to serve as president of the Fascist state's Grand Council of Public Education (1926–28), and even gained membership on the powerful Fascist Grand Council (1925–29).

Gentile's philosophical system – the foundation of all Fascist philosophy – viewed thought as all-embracing: no-one could actually leave his or her sphere of thought, nor exceed his or her thought. Reality was unthinkable, except in relation to the activity by means of which it becomes thinkable, positing that as a unity — held in the active subject and the discrete [[abstraction|abstract]] [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] that reality comprehends – wherein each phenomenon, when truly realised, was centered within that unity; therefore, it was innately [[supernatural|spiritual]], [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]], and [[Immanence|immanent]], to all possible things in contact with the unity. Gentile used that philosophic frame to systematize every item of interest that now was subject to the rule of absolute self-identification – thus rendering as correct every consequence of the [[hypothesis]]. The resultant philosophy can be interpreted as an [[idealism|idealist]] foundation for [[Legal Naturalism]].

Giovanni Gentile was described by Mussolini, and by himself, as "the philosopher of Fascism"; moreover, he was the [[ghostwriter]] of part of the essay, ''[[The Doctrine of Fascism]]'' (1932), attributed to Mussolini.&lt;ref&gt;"The first half of the article was the work of Giovanni Gentile; only the second half was Mussolini's own work, though the whole article appeared under his name." Adrian Lyttelton, Italian Fascisms: from Pareto to Gentile, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in 1932, in the ''Italian Encyclopedia'', wherein he described the traits characteristic of Italian Fascism at the time: compulsory state [[corporatism]], [[The Republic (Plato)|Philosopher Kings]], the abolition of the [[Parliament of Italy|parliamentary]] system, and [[autarky]]. He also wrote the ''[[Manifesto of the Fascist Intellectuals]]'' which was signed by a number of writers and intellectuals, including [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]] and [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]].

===Final years and death===
Gentile became a member of the [[Fascist Grand Council]] in 1925, and remained loyal to Mussolini even after the fall of the Fascist government in 1943. He supported Mussolini's establishment of the "[[Italian Social Republic|Republic of Salò]]", a puppet state of [[Nazi Germany]], despite having criticized its anti-Jewish laws, and accepted an appointment in its government. Gentile was the last president of the [[Royal Academy of Italy]] (1943–1944).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/229340/Giovanni-Gentile|title=Giovanni Gentile {{!}} Italian philosopher|newspaper=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 a group of [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]], led by {{ill|Bruno Fanciullacci|it}}, murdered the "philosopher of Fascism" as he returned from the prefecture in [[Florence]], where he had been arguing for the release of anti-fascist intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Bruno Fanciullacci|Bruno Fanciullacci]] on Italian Wikipedia. The surname ''Fanciullacci'' translates as "bad kids" in English, a coincidental irony given Gentile's actualism proposed the identity of philosophy, political action, and paedagogy (see, Gentile's [http://www.filosofico.net/Antologia_file/AntologiaG/GENTILE_%20L%20IDENTITA%20DI%20PEDAGOGIA.htm ''Sommario di pedagogia come scienza filosofica'']).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Benedetto Croce wrote that Gentile "... holds the honor of having been the most rigorous neo-Hegelian in the entire history of Western philosophy and the dishonor of having been the official philosopher of Fascism in Italy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Benedetto Croce]], ''Guide to Aesthetics'', Translated by Patrick Romanell, "Translator's Introduction," The Library of Liberal Arts, The Bobbs–Merrill Co., Inc., 1965&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophical basis for fascism was rooted in his understanding of [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]], in which he found vindication for the rejection of [[individualism]], and acceptance of [[collectivism]], with the [[Sovereign state|state]] as the ultimate location of authority and loyalty outside of which individuality had no meaning (and which in turn helped justify the [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] dimension of fascism).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm|title=Mussolini – THE DOCTRINE OF FASCISM|website=www.worldfuturefund.org|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conceptual relationship between Gentile's [[actual idealism]] and his conception of fascism is not self-evident. The supposed relationship does not appear to be based on logical deducibility. That is, actual idealism does not entail a fascist ideology in any rigorous sense. Gentile enjoyed fruitful intellectual relations with Croce from 1899 – and particularly during their joint editorship of ''La Critica'' from 1903 to 1922 – but broke philosophically and politically from Croce in the early 1920s over Gentile's embrace of fascism. (Croce assesses their philosophical disagreement in ''Una discussione tra filosofi amici'' in ''Conversazioni Critiche'', II.)

Ultimately, Gentile foresaw a social order wherein opposites of all kinds weren't to be considered as existing independently from each other; that 'publicness' and 'privateness' as broad interpretations were currently [[Reflexivity (social theory)|false as imposed]] by all former kinds of government, including capitalism and [[communism]]; and that only the reciprocal totalitarian state of Corporative Syndicalism, a fascist state, could defeat these problems which are made from [[Reification (fallacy)|reifying]] as an external reality that which is in fact, to Gentile, only a reality in thinking. Whereas it was common in the philosophy of the time to see the conditional subject as abstract and the object as concrete, Gentile postulated (after Hegel) the opposite, that the subject is concrete and the object a mere abstraction (or rather, that what was conventionally dubbed "subject" is in fact only conditional object, and that the true subject is the ''act of'' being or essence of the object).

Gentile was, because of his ''actualist'' system, a notable philosophical presence across Europe during his time. At its base, Gentile's brand of idealism asserted the primacy of the "[[Actus purus|pure act]]" of thinking. This act is foundational to all human experience – it ''creates'' the phenomenal world – and involves a process of "reflective awareness" (in Italian, "l'atto del pensiero, pensiero pensante") that is constitutive of the Absolute and revealed in education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gentile's emphasis on seeing Mind as the Absolute signaled his "revival of the idealist doctrine of the autonomy of the mind."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It also connected his philosophical work to his vocation as a teacher. In actual idealism, then, pedagogy is [[Transcendental philosophy|transcendental]] and provides the process by which the Absolute is revealed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His idea of a transcending [[Verstehen|truth above positivism]] garnered particular attention by emphasizing that all modes of sensation only take the form of ideas within one's mind; in other words, they are mental constructs. To Gentile, for example, even the correlation of the function and location of the physical brain with the functions of the physical body was merely a consistent creation of the mind, and not of the brain (itself a creation of the mind). Observations like this have led some commentators to view Gentile's philosophy as a kind of "absolute [[solipsism]]," expressing the idea "that only the spirit or mind is real".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Theory_of_Mind_as_Pure_Act.html?id=GnSdPwAACAAJ&amp;hl=en|title=The Theory of Mind as Pure Act|last=Gentile|first=Giovanni|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Living Time Press|isbn=9781905820375|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actual idealism also touches on ideas of concern to theology. An example of actual idealism in theology is the idea that although man may have invented the concept of God, it does not make God any less real in any possible sense, so long as God is not presupposed to exist as abstraction'','' and except in case qualities about what existence actually entails (i.e. being invented apart from the thinking that makes it) are presupposed. Benedetto Croce objected that Gentile's "pure act" is nothing other than [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s [[Will (philosophy)|will]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Dagobert D. Runes|Runes, Dagobert]], editor, ''Treasure of Philosophy'', "Gentile, Giovanni"&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, Gentile proposed a form of what he called "absolute [[Immanentism]]" in which the divine was the present conception of reality in the totality of one's individual thinking as an evolving, growing and dynamic process.  Many times accused of solipsism, Gentile maintained his philosophy to be a [[Humanism]] that sensed the possibility of nothing beyond what was colligate in perception; the self's human thinking, in order to communicate as immanence is to be human like oneself, made a cohesive empathy of the self-same, without an external division, and therefore not modeled as objects to one's own thinking. Whereas [[Nondualism#Nondualism versus solipsism|solipsism would feel trapped]] in realization of its solitude, actualism rejects such a privation and is an expression of the only freedom which is possible within objective contingencies, where the transcendental Self does not even exist as an object, and the dialectical co-substantiation of others necessary to understand the empirical self are felt as true others when found to be the unrelativistic subjectivity of that whole self and essentially unified with the spirit of such higher self ''in actu'', where others can be truly known, rather than thought as windowless monads.

===Phases of his thought===
A number of developments in Gentile's thought and career helped to define his philosophy, including:
* the definition of Actual Idealism in his work ''Theory of the Pure Act'' (1903);
* his support for the invasion of [[Libya]] (1911) and the entry of Italy into [[World War I]] (1915);
* his dispute with [[Benedetto Croce]] over the historic inevitability of Fascism;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unz.org/Pub/LivingAge-1925sep19-00637 "Croce and Gentile,"] ''The Living Age,'' 19 September 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;
* his role as minister of education (1922–24);
* his belief that Fascism could be made subservient to his philosophical thought, along with his gathering of influence through the work of students like [[Armando Carlini]] (leader of the so-called "right Gentilians") and [[Ugo Spirito]] (who applied Gentile's philosophy to social problems and helped codify Fascist political theory); and
* his work on the ''[[Treccani|Enciclopedia Italiana]]'' (1925–43; first edition finished in 1936).

===Gentile's definition of and vision for Fascism ===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2018}}

Gentile sought to make his philosophy the basis for Fascism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The philosophical Basis of Fascism By Sir Giovanni Gentile .|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with Gentile and with Fascism, the "problem of the party" existed by virtue of the fact that the Fascist "party", as such, arose organically rather than from a tract or pre-established socio-political doctrine. This complicated the matter for Gentile as it left no consensus to any way of thinking among Fascists, but ironically this aspect was to Gentile's view of how a state or party doctrine should live out its existence: with [[Organicism|natural organic growth]] and dialectical opposition intact. The fact that Mussolini gave credence to Gentile's view points via Gentile's authorship helped with an official consideration, even though the "problem of the party" continued to exist for Mussolini as well.

Gentile placed himself within the Hegelian tradition, but also sought to distance himself from those views he considered erroneous. He criticized Hegel's dialectic (of Idea-Nature-Spirit), and instead proposed that everything is Spirit, with the dialectic residing in the ''pure act'' of thinking. Gentile believed Marx's conception of the dialectic to be the fundamental flaw of his application to system making. To the neo-Hegelian Gentile, Marx had made the dialectic into an external object, and therefore had abstracted it by making it part of a material process of historical development. The dialectic to Gentile could only be something of human precepts, something that is an active part of human thinking. It was, to Gentile, concrete subject and not [[abstract object]]. This Gentile expounded by how humans think in forms wherein one side of a dual opposite could not be thought of without its complement.

"Upward" wouldn't be known without "downward" and "heat" couldn't be known without "cold", while each are opposites they are co-dependent for either one's realization: these were creations that existed as dialectic only in human thinking and couldn't be confirmed outside of which, and especially could not be said to exist in a condition external to human thought like independent matter and a world outside of personal subjectivity or as an empirical reality when not conceived in unity and from the standpoint of the human mind.

To Gentile, Marx's externalizing of the dialectic was essentially a fetishistic mysticism. Though when viewed externally thus, it followed that Marx could then make claims to the effect of what state or condition the dialectic objectively existed in history, ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' of where any individuals opinion was while comporting oneself to the totalized whole of society. i.e. people themselves could by such a view be ideologically 'backwards' and left behind from the current state of the dialectic and not themselves be part of what is actively creating the dialectic as-it-is.

Gentile thought this was absurd, and that there was no 'positive' independently existing dialectical object. Rather, the dialectic was natural to the state, as-it-is. Meaning that the interests composing the state are composing the dialectic by their living organic process of holding oppositional views within that state, and unified therein. It being the mean condition of those interests as ever they exist. Even criminality, is unified as a necessarily dialectic to be subsumed into the state and a creation and natural outlet of the dialectic of the positive state as ever it is.

This view (influenced by the Hegelian theory of the state) justified the corporative system, where in the individualized and particular interests of all divergent groups were to be personably incorporated into the state ("Stato etico") each to be considered a bureaucratic branch of the state itself and given official leverage. Gentile, rather than believing the private to be swallowed synthetically within the public as Marx would have it in his objective dialectic, believed that public and private were ''a priori'' identified with each other in an active and subjective dialectic: one could not be subsumed fully into the other as they already are beforehand the same. In such a manner each is the other after their own fashion and from their respective, relative, and reciprocal, position. Yet both constitute the state itself and neither are free from it, nothing ever being truly free from it, the state (as in Hegel) existing as an eternal condition and not an objective, abstract collection of atomistic values and facts of the particulars about what is positively governing the people at any given time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2769">'''Homelessness Australia''' (HA) is the national [[peak body organisation]] for homelessness services and homeless people in Australia. The organisation provides systemic advocacy for the sector and works in collaboration with support services, state and national homelessness organisations, other peak organisations, government agencies and the broader community. Homelessness Australia was formed in late 1998 as the '''Australian Federation of Homelessness Organisations''' (AFHO) by the Council to Homeless Persons Australia (CHPA), National Youth Coalition for Housing (NYCH), and Women's Services Network (WESNET). The organisation was established with the mission of advancing research and promoting national policy and action to reduce homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homelessnessaustralia.org.au/index.php/about-us/what-we-do|title=What We Do|publisher=Homelessness Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==
The organisation maintains that without strong national peak bodies, government decision makers may ignore the important welfare issues of affordable housing and homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shelter.org.au/housing-supply-media-releases/joint-statement-national-shelter-community-housing-federation|title=Joint statement from National Shelter, Community Housing Federation of Australia and Homelessness Australia - Shelter (National)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HA and other homelessness services launched a #VoteHome campaign, proposing that government assist in halving the number of homeless by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/mission-australia-anglicare-unitingcare-the-salvation-army-wesley-mission-and-st-vincent-de-paul-pressure-government-on-homelessness-20160523-gp1am9.html|title='I ended up losing everything': How a shoulder injury set Ian's life off course|first=Rachel|last=Browne|date=24 May 2016|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HA has stated that the often cited statistics on homelessness do not reflect those "on the verge" of homelessness, which they estimate to be at 850,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/ghost-hunting-will-the-census-reveal-the-true-scale-of-homelessness-in-australia-63336|title=Ghost-hunting: will the census reveal the true scale of homelessness in Australia?|first=Eileen|last=Webb|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
Since 2007, Homelessness Australia has coordinated a national awareness week for homeless people, [[Homeless Persons' Week]].

[[File:Maracaibo drainage basin map-cropped-fr.svg|thumb|right|300px|The hydrography of most of Norte de Santander is part of the Maracaibo Lake basin]]
The [[departments of Colombia|department]] of [[Norte de Santander]] in northwestern [[Colombia]], and its capital, [[Cúcuta]], contains several rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia-sa.com/departamentos/nsantander/nsantander-in.html |title=Norte de Santander, Colombia - South America |website=Colombia-sa.com |accessdate=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rivers are mostly part of the [[Maracaibo Lake]] basin, with the southeastern section located in the [[Magdalena River]] basin. Important fluvial elements are the [[Zulia River|Zulia]], [[Catatumbo River|Catatumbo]] and [[Pamplonita River]]s. The entity in charge of taking care of these hydrology of Norte de Santander is Corponor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corponor.gov.co/es/index.php/plan-de-accion-institucional-pai-2016-2019 |title=Plan de Acción Institucional PAI 2016-2019 |publisher=Corponor |accessdate=2017-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topography ==
The department of Norte de Santander is for the most part situated in the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] of the Colombian [[Andes]]. The northeastern majority of the department is part of the [[Maracaibo Lake]] [[drainage basin]], while the southwestern tip of Norte de Santander forms part of the [[Magdalena River]] basin. The southeasternmost part of the department is located in the [[Orinoco River]] basin. The department, reaching to an altitude of {{convert|3329|m|ft}} in the [[Tamá Páramo]], has a total surface area of {{convert|22367|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.todacolombia.com/departamentos-de-colombia/norte-de-santander.html Norte de Santander]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydrography ==
=== Catatumbo River ===
[[File:Río Zulia en.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Catatumbo River basin in Norte de Santander and Venezuela, with main tributaries]]
{{main|Catatumbo River}}
The Catatumbo River is a fast flowing river, originating as the confluence of the Peralonso, Sardinata and Zulia Rivers in the central valley of Norte de Santander.

The upper part of the river is sourced from the highlands near the Macho Rucio Peak ("gray mule peak"), located in the south of [[Ocaña, Colombia|Ocaña]] province. Its mouth is at Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela, through a delta called La Empalizada ("the fence"). Early sections of the Catatumbo River are known as Chorro Oroque, Rio de la Cruz, and Algodonal. Only in the Venezuelan section it is navegable.

Left [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Catatumbo River include:
;Main affluents: Río Frío, Río de Oro, Erbura, Tiradera and San Miguelito  
;Minor affluents: Sajada, El Molino, San Lucas, Los Indios, Zurita, Carbón, Naranjito, Sánchez, Joaquín Santos, Teja, San Carlos, Guaduas, Águila, Lejía, Honda, Capitán Largo, Manuel Díaz, Oropora, Huevo, La Vieja, Guayabal, Guamos and Roja

Right tributaries include:
;Main affluents: San Miguel, Tarra, Orú, [[Sardinata River|Sardinata]] and [[Zulia River|Zulia]]  
;Minor affluents: La Urugmita, La Labranza, Seca, Cargamenta and San Calixto or Maravilla

==== Peralonso River ====
[[File:Alto de Los Compadres NS.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Alto de los Compadres, seen from the Peralonso River]]
The Peralonso River originates in a small lake in the Guerrero highlands, at {{convert|3100|m|ft}} altitude. It crosses the municipalities of Salazar, Gramalote, Santiago, San Cayetano and Cúcuta, ending in the Zulia River, near the village of San Cayetano. It forms the upper course of the Catatumbo River.

==== Sardinata River ====
The [[Sardinata River]] originates in La Vuelta, in the Guerrero highlands, near the village of Caro at about {{convert|3100|m|ft}} above sea level. It has a length of almost {{convert|17|km|mi}}. Near the river, many forestal and mining activities are present. Its affluents are on the left tributary Santa and the right tributaries Riecito San Miguel, La Sapa, José, La Esmeralda, La Resaca and Pedro José. Its Colombian segment ends in Tres Bocas and continues in Venezuela terminating in the  Catatumbo River.

=== Zulia River ===
[[File:Zuliaadelpuente.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Zulia River]]
{{main|Zulia River}}
The Zulia River is formed by several rivers originating in lakes in the highlands of [[Cachiri]] at about 4,220 meters above sea level, and located between&lt;!--needs more numbers for the "between" to make sense, two latitude or two longitude numbers, or both--&gt; 12°41'2" east longitude and  8’9" north latitude in the Santander Department, in the eastern range of the [[Andes]] mountains. The river flows through the province of Cúcuta, passing through the neighbouring nation of [[Venezuela]], and ends in the waters of [[Lake Maracaibo]].

In Colombian territory, this river is navigable for about {{convert|70|km|mi}}, starting from the old port of Los Canchos. The river flows for {{convert|260|km|mi}} through Venezuela, the last {{convert|80|km|mi}} being deep and calm, adaptable to embarkments of big proportions.

In the past, this river provided a basic means of transportation which was responsible for much of prosperity of the neighbouring valleys, like the center of nutritioned commerce, whose products fed many of the towns nearby. The Zulia river's tributaries include the Cucutilla, Arboleda, [[Salazar River|Salazar]] and the [[Peralonso River]]s, which flow from the left, and the [[Pamplonita River]] with its own tributaries the [[Táchira River|Táchira]] and [[La Grita River]]s, flowing from the right.

Areas surrounding the Zulia River are fertile, with many forests decorating the landscape. However, the climate of this area could be seen as unhealthy, due to the density of trees and the many swamps.

==== Salazar River ====
[[File:Río Salazar NS.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|Salazar River]]
The Salazar River originates near the city of [[Zulia]] and terminates near the namesake town of [[Salazar de las Palmas]]. It's an important river in the tradition of local inhabitants. It is used for swimming, fishing and cooking the traditional [[sancocho]] soup on the beaches of the river. There are some areas of the river near Salazar city that have waterfalls of many minor water streams falling into the river, that are often visited by tourists.

==== La Grita River ====
La Grita River originates in the Venezuelan [[Andes]] near the town of La Grita at about {{convert|3000|m|ft}} above sea level. It's a natural boundary between Colombia and Venezuela for about {{convert|5|km|mi}}, until its mouth in the Zulia River. Its affluents are the Guaramito River, La China, Riecito, Río Lobatera, and Caño de La Miel.

=== Pamplonita River ===
[[File:Río pamplonita y el mt tasajero 2.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Pamplonita River in Cúcuta]]
{{main|Pamplonita River}}
The Pamplonita River was of crucial importance in the economy of the country in the 18th to 19th centuries as the main channel for the transportation of [[Cocoa bean|cacao]].

It originates in the Altogrande Mountains at {{convert|3000|m|ft}} above sea level, near the city of [[Pamplona, Norte de Santander|Pamplona]]. It flows downhill through the Cariongo Valley, and near [[Chinácota]] the confluence with the minor affluent Honda River is situated. The Pamplonita River flows through the  [[Cúcuta]] valley, where it has a slow flow, ending in the Zulia River, flowing towards Maracaibo Lake. Most of this river is above {{convert|150|m|ft}} above sea level. The total length of the river is about {{convert|115|km|mi}} and its [[drainage basin|watershed]] covers {{convert|137524|ha|acre}}. 

The confluence of the Pamplonita and Zulia Rivers is located near the urban area of Cúcuta, the capital of Norte de Santander, in particular the Rinconada neighborhood. This part contains the risk of flooding, until in the streets of the city. The river has periodically flooded the local hospital and the Colón Park, named after [[Christopher Columbus|Cristóbal Colón]]. The river also produces a significant erosion in the surrounding lands, in part because of the local dry climate and shortage of vegetation. This is seen more noticeably in the areas near Cúcuta; La Garita and Los Vados.

The Pamplonita River crosses the municipalities of: [[Cúcuta]], [[Pamplona, Norte de Santander|Pamplona]], [[Los Patios]], [[Chinácota]], [[Bochalema]] and [[Pamplonita]], and the villages of El Diamante, La Donjuana, La Garita, San Faustino and Agua Clara.

The river receives sewage water from Pamplona, Los Patios and Cúcuta, and residues from [[slaughterhouse]]s, [[pesticide]]s and fertilizers. The 1541 law regulates the use of water from the rivers to concessions regulated by the local government, but there are many illegal non-regulated diversions of water.

[[File:Río Táchira, frontera Colombia - Venezuela.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Táchira River, forming the border between Colombia and Venezuela]]
Affluents of Pamplonita River are:
;Right
Main affluents: [[Táchira River]], Rio Viejo, Las Brujas, Caño Cachicana and Caño Guardo&lt;br&gt;
Minor affluents: Monteadentro, Los Negros, Los Cerezos, Zipachá, Tanauca, Ulagá, El Gabro, El Ganso, Santa Helena, Cucalina, La Teja, De Piedra, La Palmita, Matagira, La Chorrera, Iscalá, Honda, Cascarena, Villa Felisa, Ciénaga, Juana Paula, Don Pedra, Faustinera, Europea, Rodea, Aguasucia

;Left
Minor affluents: Navarro, San Antonio, La Palma, Hojancha, La Laguna, Batagá, Galindo, Santa Lucía, Las Colonias, El Laurel, Chiracoca, Montuosa, El Masato, Quebraditas, Aguanegra, Zorzana, El Ojito, Jaguala, Viajaguala, Tío José, El Magro, Aguadas, La Rinconada, Periquera, Voladora, La Sarrera, La Cuguera, Guaimaraca, Aguaclarera, La Trigrera, Negro, El Oso, and Chipo

==== Táchira River ====
[[File:Cuenca Rio Tachira.svg|thumb|right|150px|Táchica River basin map]]
{{main|Táchira River}}
The Táchira River originates near Tamá, in the mountains of Las Banderas, at an altitude of {{convert|3368|m|ft}} above sea level. The river flows towards the north, as a natural boundary between Colombia and Venezuela. It crosses the municipalities of Herrán, Ragonvalia, Villa del Rosario and Cúcuta. Tachira River flows into the Pamplonita River near the village El Escobal.

Its affluents are El Salado, La Margarita, El Naranjal, Palogordo, El Palito, Agua Sucia and la Horma.

The '''Jerusalem-Project'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lassalle-institut.org/en/jerusalemprojekt/ Homepage Lassalle-Institut. Jerusalem Project. Retrieved 2011-11-21]&lt;/ref&gt; is a Swiss-Israeli-Palestinian initiative for the creation of new, unexpected perspectives, which should create a [[Win-win situation]] for Israelis and Palestinians. First activities began in 2003; after a preparation for years a systematic cooperation of three essential partners was initiated in October 2008 for a time period of 20 years.

==Cooperation partners==
The ''International Peace and Cooperation Center'' (IPCC) with seat in the western Jerusalem neighborhood of [[French Hill]] is a Palestinian co-operative organization, that was founded in 1998 by Dr. Rami Nasrallah who is the current executive head of the organization. Its mission is to support the development of a highly informed, competent and active Palestinian civil society which participates in urban democracy and is capable of defending its social, economic and political rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.ipcc-jerusalem.org/en/ipcc/7/153 The International Peace and Cooperation Centre. Mission. Retrieved 2011-11-17]&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC is active in the fields of policy research, urban planning, zoning and development,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_planning_crisis_east_jerusalem_april_2009_english.pdf United Nations, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, occupied Palestinian territory.

Retrieved 2011-11-21]&lt;/ref&gt; civil society and community engagement, and the media.  The IPCC received £400,000 in 2011 and 2012 from the British [[Foreign Office]]. The IPCC has claimed that Israel’s policy in Jerusalem aimed “to segregate and paralyse the urban fabric," and that "the motive behind Israel’s security barrier was to redraw the municipal borders of Jerusalem."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/82746/investigate-uk-funding-palestinian-ngos%E2%80%99 Investigate UK Funding of Palestinian NGOs]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Futura-Institute'' (FI) was founded by Professor Shlomo Hasson as a [[think tank]] to discuss issues concerning the future of the State of Israel from a geopolitical, social, economic and cultural perspective. This [[policy institute]] was inspired by a [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]] of [[Theodor Herzl]], which he outlined in his novel ''[[The Old New Land]]'' (1902).&lt;ref&gt;[http://futurainstitute.com/ Futura Institut. Retrieved 2011-11-17]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Lassalle-Institute'' (LI), based within the [[:de:Lassalle-Haus|Lassalle-Haus]], was founded by Pia Gyger and [[Niklaus Brantschen]]. It works with leaders in business, politics and other sectors of society. By means of lectures, seminars, research, coaching and corporate consulting, the institute advocates ethics rooted in holistic consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lassalle-institut.org/en/about/ Lassalle-Institut. Mission Statement. Retrieved 2011-11-17]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, it obtained consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/coordination/ngo/pdf/INF_List.pdf United Nations Economic and Social Council. List of non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council as of 18 September 2008, p.48], Retrieved 2011-11-18&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Jerusalem – Open City for Learning World Peace''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lassalle-institut.org/files/2010_open-jerusalem_project-description.pdf Jerusalem – Open City for Learning World Peace]&lt;/ref&gt; is the most important project of the Lassalle-Institut. 
{{wide image|Panorma_Jerusalem_vomHospiz_JPEG.jpg|750px|Jerusalem: A city of two nations with neighborhoods, buildings and holy sites of all three [[Abrahamic religions]].}}

==Vision==

The vision of the Lassalle-Institut for Jerusalem is based on biblical prophecies ([[Book of Micah]] and [[Book of Isaiah]]), that are holy to the three major [[Abrahamic religions]] and speak of Jerusalem as "The Holy City of Peace".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lassalle-institut.org/files/pdf-2010/broschuere_li_offenes-jerusalem.pdf Lassalle-Institut. "Offenes Jerusalem. Retrieved 2011-11-17]&lt;/ref&gt;
These texts deliver what can be seen as guidelines for Jerusalem and all humankind:
* «They shall beat their swords into plowshares» [[Book of Micah]] 4:3  – Disarmament and transformation of arms
* «Neither shall they learn war any more» [[Book of Micah]] 4:3 – Training and building of a culture of peace
* «All people will walk every one in the name of his god» [[Book of Micah]] 4:5 – Interreligious and intercultural dialogue based on mutual appreciation.

In the future, Jerusalem should be:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lassalle-institut.org/en/jerusalemprojekt/vision/ Homepage Lassalle-Institut. Vision]&lt;/ref&gt;
* a unique capital of two states: of the state of Palestine and the state of Israel
* an open city: politically divided, physically undivided
* a city in which people and goods circulate freely between the different sectors and the surrounding areas
* a city of peaceful coexistence
* a functioning, versatile town with high quality of life
* a cosmopolitan city which constitutes a universal centre of peace and conflict resolution as a part of the global network of cosmopolitan cities
* a city which connects the strengths of its cultural and religious heritage with tourism, financial services and information technology
* a city which becomes a place of peace between mankind and the earth – thanks to renewable energy, sustainability in urban planning and an environmentally friendly lifestyle of the population

Hasson and Nasrallah have developed a joint vision for Jerusalem as an open city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://futurainstitute.com/joc.pdf. Hasson, Shlomo &amp; Nasrallah, Rami (2010). "Jerusalem Open City. From Vision to Program". Retrieved 2011-11-14]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors promote a two-state solution with two capitals, living side by side in peace. The main idea is that Jerusalem should be politically divided but physically, economically and socially should function as one open city.

==Activities==

===Contact with the United Nations (UN)===

In January 2009, the Lassalle Institute associated the partners from East Jerusalem and West Jerusalem with representatives of the UN, including the Swiss ambassador Paul Seger. In 2009 and 2010, the Lassalle Institute linked up the IPCC and the FI with the offices of the [[United Nations Development Programme]] and the [[European Commission]] in Jerusalem.

===Activities in Jerusalem===

In January 2007, the Lassalle-Institut set up an office in Jerusalem. The leaders of the Jerusalem-Project within the Lassalle Institut, [[Niklaus Brantschen]] and [[Pia Gyger]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lassalle-institut.org/en/about/leitung/ Homepage Lassalle-Institut: Staff members]&lt;/ref&gt; live in Jerusalem twice a year for several weeks for networking.

===Activities in Switzerland===

The Lassalle-Institut in Bad Schoenbrunn and in particular its Jerusalem office are continuously evolving the project, establishing it in Switzerland, preparing conferences at the Lassalle-Haus, visiting Jerusalem and the United Nations Headquarters in New York, doing fundraising and other activities.

===Conference: Jerusalem: The Global Challenge===

From October 14–16, 2010, the first annual international conference on the issue of Jerusalem and the challenges it faces was held under the title ''Jerusalem: The Global Challenge'' in the „Pontifical Institute Notre Dame of Jerusalem Centre“ in Jerusalem. It was organized by the Lassalle-Institut, the IPCC and the Futura Institute, with the support of the Swiss [[Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]] (FDFA) and the office of the European Commission in East Jerusalem. The purpose of the conference was to make the Jerusalem-Project known in Jerusalem and to form a network of engaged Israelis, Palestinians, and international community representatives who would promote the vision and the activities of the Jerusalem-Project. There was a mutual recognition that Jerusalem should be politically divided according to the principles of the two-state solution but physically, socially and economically united.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lassalle-institut.org/files/pdf-2010/final-program_1st-conference_jerusalem.pdf Jerusalem: The Global Challenge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17707">{{Politics of Croatia}}
This is a list of cabinets of [[Croatian government]], the chief [[executive (government)|executive]] body of the [[Croatia|Republic of Croatia]].

Note that between 1990 and 2000 Croatia had a [[semi-presidential system]] and members of government, including Prime Ministers, were all directly appointed and removed by the [[President of Croatia]], this post being held by [[Franjo Tuđman]] from 1990 to late 1999. During his  two terms as president, Tuđman was also the chairman of the ruling conservative [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ), with all Prime Ministers in this period also coming from his party's ranks.

Following Tuđman's death in December 1999 and the subsequent [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2000|January 2000 general election]], the new centre-left parliamentary majority led by [[Ivica Račan]] amended the [[Constitution of Croatia]] in November 2000 and introduced a [[parliamentary system]], greatly reducing the President's executive powers. Therefore, Prime Ministers since Račan have usually been the leaders of parties (or coalition of parties) which held a parliament majority according to results of the general election. Meanwhile, the position of president of the Republic was made into a non-party post, which meant that Presidents who served after Tuđman ([[Stjepan Mesić]] from 2000 to 2010, [[Ivo Josipović]] from 2010 to 2015 and [[Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović]] since 2015) "froze" or resigned their party memberships upon getting elected or taking office for the entire duration of their 5-year terms.

There have been 12 Prime Ministers since the introduction of a multi-party system  via the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|1990 general election]] and 14 governments headed by them. Since [[Statehood Day (Croatia)|independence]] in June 1991, however, there have been 11 prime ministers and 13 governments (beginning with that of [[Josip Manolić]]).

Nine Prime Ministers were members of the [[Croatian Democratic Union|HDZ]] during their term in office, two were members of the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia|SDP]] and one was not a member of any political party. To date two Prime Ministers (Ivica Račan and Ivo Sanader) have chaired more than one government.

The longest serving Prime Ministers to date have been [[Ivo Sanader]], who held the post for 2,022 days between December 2003 and July 2009, followed by [[Zoran Milanović]] (1637 days from December 2011 until January 2016), [[Zlatko Mateša]] (1,542 days from November 1995 to January 2000) and [[Ivica Račan]] (1,426 days from January 2000 to December 2003). The shortest serving Prime Minister was [[Stjepan Mesić]] (86 days from May to August 1990).

To date the only Prime Minister to have been voted out of office by a motion of no confidence is [[Tihomir Orešković]], on 16 June 2016. He also has the distinction of being the first [[non-partisan]] Prime Minister.

Founded in [[Toronto]] in 1988, the '''Loran Scholars Foundation''' is a national charitable organization awarding [[scholarship]]s for students entering [[List of universities in Canada|university]] in [[Canada]]. Loran Scholars receive the country's largest undergraduate merit award on the basis of character, commitment to service and leadership potential.

==Loran Scholars==

The '''Loran Scholars Foundation''' selects up to 34 students each year for an undergraduate scholarship valued at $100,000.&lt;ref name="Loran"&gt;{{Cite web
| url        = http://loranscholar.ca/loran-awards/
| title      = Loran Awards
| publisher  = Loran Scholars Foundation
| accessdate = 2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been active since 1990.

The scholarship is tenable at 25 public universities throughout Canada; however, the lower level awards (provincial awards and finalist awards) can be used at any public Canadian university or college. Twenty-one Loran Scholars have gone on to win [[Rhodes Scholarships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title      = Rhodes Scholars
| publisher  = Loran Scholars Foundation
| url        = http://loranscholar.ca/rhodes-scholars/
| accessdate = 2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of annual stipends, a matching tuition waiver, summer internship funding, annual retreats and scholar gatherings, and mentoring over four years of study.

===Candidate selection===

The Loran Scholar selection process is rigorous. The selection process is as follows:

* Close to 2,500 nominees come as sponsored candidates, with endorsements from their schools. Each secondary school can sponsor up to three students, and each [[CEGEP]] in Quebec can sponsor up to eight students. Evaluations are made by 39 committees in 23 regions, from [[St John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] to [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], and then close to 500 semi-finalists, or approximately 10 candidates per committee, are chosen for regional interviews.
* Over 2,500 candidates come through the direct pool (self-nomination). The national assessment panel evaluates the application of each candidate, and telephone interviews are conducted with semi-finalists in December.
* Up to 88 finalists are invited from across Canada to attend two days of National Selections in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Municipal Association of Victoria''' (MAV) is the legislated peak body for representing [[Local government in Victoria|local government in Victoria]].

== Aims ==
The overall purpose of the MAV is to represent the interests of the 79 local governments in Victoria. Its stated roles are to support councils and [[Councillor|councillors]], provide a platform for advocacy and promote the role of [[Local government|local government]]. The organisation also provides services to its member councils. These include joint procurement, insurance and policy advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mav.asn.au/about-us/Pages/default.aspx|title=MAV - About us|last=|first=|date=|website=MAV|publisher=Municipal Association of Victoria|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Association was created in 1879 to represent the interests of local government in Victoria. The ''Municipal Association Act 1907'' of the [[Parliament of Victoria]] formally recognised the organisation as a peak body, primarily for the purpose of creating the Municipal Officers Fidelity Guarantee Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/maa1907224/|title=Municipal Association Act 1907|last=|first=|date=1907-08-27|website=MAV|publisher=Parliament of Victoria|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1994 council amalgamations ===
During the amalgamation of local councils in Victoria in the early 1990s, the MAV campaigned against the [[Procurement|compulsory competitive tendering]] introduced for the 78 new councils created after the process, arguing that it had significant impacts on both council employees and residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dowling|first1=Jason|title=Kennett's blitz a decade on|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/04/24/1082719671977.html|accessdate=24 July 2016|agency=The Age|date=2004-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MAV Submission to the Productivity  Commission Review of National Competition Policy|url=http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/national-competition-policy/submissions/73/sub073.pdf|publisher=Productivity Commission|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the amalgamations and return of democratic government in 1996/97, the MAV ran a number of programs to monitor and support councils restructuring in the new process. This included the Step Asset Management Program, which eventually assessed a large number of primarily rural councils as being financially unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Financial Sustainability for local government - the Victorian Context|url=http://alga.asn.au/?ID=5093|website=Australian Local Government Association|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2015 Victorian Auditor-General's Report ===
In February 2015, the Victorian Auditor-General published a report into Local Government Victoria and the MAV on the effectiveness, efficiency and economy of the support provided to councils. It found serious structural and [[Governance|governance]] deficiencies in the MAV, prompting significant media coverage on its findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Masanaukas|first1=John|title=Auditor-General John Doyle slams Municipal Association of Victoria over anti-fraud and corruption processes|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/auditorgeneral-john-doyle-slams-municipal-association-of-victoria-over-antifraud-and-corruption-processes/news-story/e1836a2312d1a6c8e7e3389457a02803|accessdate=24 July 2016|agency=Herald Sun|date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SeymourTelegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chaplat|first1=Sonti|title=Municipal Association of Victoria explains itself|url=http://www.mmg.com.au/local-news/seymour/municipal-association-of-victoria-explains-itself-1.90889|accessdate=24 July 2016|agency=Seymour Telegraph|date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report questioned many aspects of the organisation's operations, including value for money of its procurement activities and lack of [[Accountability|public accountability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effectiveness of Support for Local Government|date=2015-02-26|url=http://www.audit.vic.gov.au/reports_and_publications/latest_reports/2014-15/20150226-support-for-local-gov.aspx|website=Victorian Auditor-General's Office|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report's conclusions prompted [[City of Frankston|Frankston City Council]] to leave the MAV in August 2015&lt;ref name="FrankstonLeave2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Neil|title=Frankston stands alone|url=http://baysidenews.com.au/2015/08/03/frankston-stands-alone/|accessdate=24 July 2016|agency=Bayside News|date=2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It rejoined in August 2017 after a new council resolution was passed. Many other councils expressed similar concern and considered ceasing their memberships, including the [[City of Monash]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VAGO REPORT ON MUNICIPAL ASSOCIATION OF VICTORIA – EFFECTIVENESS OF SUPPORT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT|url=http://www.monash.vic.gov.au/files/assets/public/about-us/council/council-meetings/2015-30-june/7.2-report.pdf|publisher=Monash City Council|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shire of Mitchell]],&lt;ref name="SeymourTelegraph" /&gt; and [[City of Boroondara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Council meeting minutes - 24 August 2015|url=https://boroondara.vic.gov.au/-/media/Files/Your%20Council/Meetings%20and%20Agendas/Council/20150824/Minutes.pdf|publisher=City of Boroondara|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Councillors from the Cities of [[City of Yarra|Yarra]] and [[City of Melbourne|Melbourne]] also expressed concerns over the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jefferson|first1=Andrew|title=Municipal Association of Victoria facing revolt from councils|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/municipal-association-of-victoria-facingrevolt-from-councils/news-story/bddb1ed234d68d6a3369e499eb2a6de9|accessdate=24 July 2016|agency=Herald Sun|date=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boroondara later withdrew its representation from the Association after a lengthy and public court battle with the [[City of Darebin]], citing issues presented in the Auditor-General's report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dow|first1=Aisha|title='Bizarre' decision by Boroondara council could thwart landmark appointment|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/bizarre-decision-by-boroondara-council-could-thwart-landmark-appointment-20170130-gu1m3v.html|accessdate=5 September 2017|agency=The Age|date=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Darebin Cr Ross appointment invalid|url=https://www.lgfocus.com.au/editions/2017-01/darebin-cr-ross-appointment-invalid.php|publisher=LG Focus|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MAV's initial response to the report disputed some of its key conclusions, including the premise that the MAV could be subject to the direction of the state government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VAGO Performance Audit Report (26 Feb)|url=http://www.mav.asn.au/news/Pages/vago-performance-audit-report-26feb15.aspx|website=MAV|publisher=Municipal Association of Victoria|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the appointment of a new board in March 2015 and a motion from the State Council in early 2016, independent auditors and consultants through [[Ernst &amp; Young]] and [[Deloitte]] have been appointed to oversee the implementation of the report's recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Membership of MAV|url=https://boroondara.vic.gov.au/-/media/Files/Your%20Council/Meetings%20and%20Agendas/Council/20160725/Report5%20Membership%20of%20MAV.pdf|publisher=City of Boroondara|accessdate=24 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
=== Board ===
The Board of the MAV is made up of councillors from member councils. It consists of 12 members elected by councils in each region and a directly elected president. Elections are conducted once every two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MAV - Board|url=http://www.mav.asn.au/about-us/board/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Municipal Association of Victoria|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State Council ===
The State Council operates as the governing body of the Association. It is made up of single representatives from all member councils who formulate, debate and vote on policies on the operations of the MAV. These include association rules, policies and strategic planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MAV - State Council|url=http://www.mav.asn.au/about-us/state-council-representatives/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=Municipal Association of Victoria|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==

The '''National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma''' ({{lang-my|ပြည်ထောင်စု မြန်မာနိုင်ငံ အမျိုးသား ညွန့်ပေါင်းအစိုးရ}} {{IPA-my|pjìdàʊɴzṵ  mjəmà nàɪɴŋàɴ əmjóðá ɲʊ̰ɴbáʊɴ əsója̰|}}; '''NCGUB''') was an administration claimed to be the [[government in exile]] of [[Burma]] (Myanmar). It had its headquarters in [[Rockville, Maryland]], [[United States]]. It was formally established in December 1990, with [[Sein Win (Burmese government in exile)|Sein Win]] as its first prime minister. It was dissolved in September 2012.

== History ==
On 18 December 1990, in [[Manerplaw]], the [[National League for Democracy]] (NLD) and the other opposition parties of Burma established the '''National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|last=Seekins |first=Donald M. |year=2017 |title=Chonology |encyclopedia=Historical Dictionary of Burma (Myanmar) |location=Lanham, Maryland |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=xxx |isbn=978-1-5381-0183-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and elected [[Sein Win (Burmese government in exile)|Sein Win]], a first cousin of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], as its [[prime minister]]. 

A newer version, the Democratic Government of Burma, replaced the original structure in [[Bommersvik]], [[Sweden]] at the special convention held there from 16–23 July 1995. In a press release, embargoed until 27 July 1995, the Elected Representatives of Burma issued the following communiqué:&lt;ref name="Bommersvik I Declaration"&gt;[http://www.ncgub.net/NCGUB/BoomersvikDeclaration1995.pdf Bommersvik Declaration I in pdf from the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma website]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Following the release of Burmese democracy leader and 1991 Nobel Peace laureate [[Aung San Suu Kyi|Daw Aung San Suu Kyi]] on 10 July 1995, the National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma (NCGUB) led by Prime Minister Dr. Sein Win, convened the first ever Convention of Elected Representatives from the liberated areas of Burma in Bommersvik, Sweden, from 16–23 July 1995. The representatives of the people of Burma elected in the 27 May 1990 general elections, met to discuss the drastically changed political situation in Burma and to re-organize the NCGUB into a more effective force to support Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's political initiatives in [[Rangoon]]. The Convention supported Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's call for a genuine political dialogue and called on the [[United Nations Secretary-General|Secretary-General of the United Nations]] to implement the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] resolution which called for him to assist in the national reconciliation process in Burma. A tripartite dialogue between the Burmese military led by [[State Law and Order Restoration Council|SLORC]]; the democracy movement led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi; and Burma's ethnic leaders; was endorsed by the elected representatives. The Convention welcomed the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and thanked all who worked for her release. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's return to politics and her determination to continue working for [[democracy]] in Burma was applauded and welcomed. The leading role played by SLORC Chairman Senior General [[Than Shwe]] in Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's release was also recognized. To give the leadership more flexibility to deal with the rapidly changing situation, the government formed by elected representatives in [[Manerplaw]] on 18 December 1990 was officially dissolved by the Convention of Elected Representatives on 21 July 1995 in [[Bommersvik]]. The Convention unanimously re-elected Dr. [[Sein Win (Burmese government in exile)|Sein Win]] by secret ballot to head the new government. The new government re-affirmed its commitment to the establishment of a multiparty [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] within the framework of a genuine [[federal union]]. The broad-based support of the new coalition government is reflected in the make up of the cabinet. The elected representatives were joined in their deliberations by representatives from the National Council of the Union of Burma, leaders of the National League for Democracy (Liberated Area), the [[United Nationalities League for Democracy]], the [[All Burma Students Democratic Front]], the [[Federation of Trade Unions of Burma]], and NCGUB representatives. The Convention was hosted by the [[Stockholm]]-based [[Olof Palme]] International Centre and the [[Norway|Norwegian]] Burma Council in Bommersvik, the training centre of the [[Swedish Social Democratic Youth League|Social Democratic Youth of Sweden]].|The [[Democracy|Democratic]] [[Forms of government|Government]] of Burma }}

On September 14, 2012, NCGUB was officially dissolved to aid the [[Reforms in Burma|reform process in Burma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Mann|first=Zarni|title=Burmese Exile Govt Dissolves After 22 years|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/archives/14042|accessdate=15 June 2013|newspaper=The Irrawaddy|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Myo|first=Nay|title=Burma’s exiled government dissolved|url=http://www.mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/8026-burmas-exiled-government-dissolved.html|accessdate=15 June 2013|newspaper=Mizzima|date=17 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531091352/http://mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/8026-burmas-exiled-government-dissolved.html|archivedate=31 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''We, the representatives of the people of Burma, elected in the 27 May 1990 general elections, meeting at the First Convention of Elected Representatives from the liberated areas of Burma, hereby - Warmly welcome the unconditional release of 1991 [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace laureate]] [[Aung San Suu Kyi|Daw Aung San Suu Kyi]] on 10 July 1995; Thank all who have worked tirelessly and consistently for the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the cause of democracy in Burma; Applaud Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's determination, in spite of having spent 6 years under house arrest, to continue to work to bring true democracy to Burma; Welcome Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's return to politics to take up the mantle of her father, General [[Aung San]], in Burma's second struggle for independence;...''|The Elected Representatives of the Union of Burma}}

== NCGUB's Future Constitution for the Union of Burma ==
The NCGUB Proposed First Draft [[Constitution]] was published by the National Council of the Union of Burma (NCUB) in December 1997 with the following [[preamble]]:&lt;ref name="Legal Resources"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blc-burma.org/legal_resource.html#ncub|title=blc-burma.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Future constitution in pdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blc-burma.org/pdf/Constitution/ncubcon_e.pdf|title=blc-burma.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4046">'''Non-Zionism''' is the political stance of [[Jews]] who "were [or are] willing to help support depoliticized Jewish settlement in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (...) but will not come on [[aliyah]]."&lt;ref name = "polish"&gt;David Polish, ''Prospects for Post-Holocaust Zionism'', in Moshe David (editor), ''Zionism in Transition'', Institute of Contemporary Jewry, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Arno Press, 1980, p.315.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trend began in the [[United States]] in the first few decades of the 20th century when "an increasingly large section of Americanized Jewish opinion began to shift away from [[anti-Zionism]] (...) either to pro-Zionism or non-Zionism. (...) The non-Zionists were willing to offer the fledgeling Jewish homeland fiscal and diplomatic counsel, not for their own benefit or spiritual comfort but for those Jews who chose to reside there."&lt;ref name = "Feldman"&gt;Egal Feldman, ''Catholics and Jews in Twentieth-Century America'', University of Illinois Press, 2001, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference from anti-Zionists==
"There is a marked difference between non-Zionism and [[anti-Zionism]]. A non-Zionist may challenge the theoretical underpinning of the concept of an 'ingathering of the exiles' in an independent [[Jewish State]]. If Jewish, he will not choose to live in [[Israel]], nor will he approve of the notion of other Jews living there (...) but anti-Zionists do not find it sufficient to be dissatisfied with a decision made and implemented a long time ago. They are not content with a critical assessment of the situation confined to an historical (and, accordingly, a theoretical) framework. Not merely do they have an adverse opinion about the establishment of Israel in the past, but they contest the legitimacy of Israel as a State in the present time and the future."&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoram Dinstein]], ''Anti-Semitism, Anti-Zionism and the United Nations'' in ''Israel's Yearbook of Human Rights'', Faculty of Law, Tel-Aviv University, vol.17, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1987, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary definitions==

===Non-position===
Non-Zionism has also been defined in terms of a non-position on Zionism.  For example, Anthony Frosh on online Jewish magazine Galus Australis, has defined a non-Zionist Jews as a Jew "who does not have any particular political relationship (positive or negative) with the State of Israel, or at least little more of a relationship than they would have with some other 3rd party state."[http://galusaustralis.com/2009/08/non-zionism-an-under-recognised-non-position/]

=== Haredi non-Zionism===
Generally, those groups of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] (Western) [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews who participate in the Israeli government but do not believe in the religious ideology of Zionism are known as "non-Zionists".  The most prominent non-Zionist Haredi group is [[World Agudath Israel|Agudath Israel]]. This is in contrast to the [[Religious Zionism|religious Zionist]] [[Mizrachi (political party)|Mizrachi party]] (which believes the State of Israel to be the beginning of the redemption); and also in contrast to the anti-Zionist Haredi groups, such as Satmar and the Edah Charedis that openly oppose Zionism and have little to no interaction with the State of Israel, and no representation in government. Unlike the older definition, many live in the State of Israel. They tend to be extremely pro-Israel politically, as can be seen in such publications as [[Mishpacha]] and [[Hamodia]]. [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] Haredi Jews may refer to themselves as Zionist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8953">The '''Northern Ireland flags issue''' is one that divides the population along [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] lines. Depending on political allegiance, people identify with differing [[flag]]s and symbols, some of which have, or have had, official status in [[Northern Ireland]].

==Common flags==
[[File:Flag of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|right|[[Union Flag]]]]
[[File:Ulster banner.svg|thumb|right|[[Ulster Banner]]]]
[[File:Flag of Ireland.svg|thumb|right|[[Flag of Ireland]]]]
*The [[flag]] of the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Union Flag]], is the only flag routinely used officially by the sovereign [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]], as well as being flown on most council buildings in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.niassembly.gov.uk/adhocs/flags/flags.pdf|title= The Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000|author= |accessdate=5 October 2011 |format= PDF|work= [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Union Flag is often flown by [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] but is disliked by [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]]. British law states that the Union Flag must be flown on designated days from central government buildings in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/2000/347/contents/made The Flags Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Ulster Banner]], the flag of the pre-1973 [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|government of Northern Ireland]], was used from 1953 to 1972 by the [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]] government to represent the government of Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica says: According to British tradition, a coat of arms or flag is granted to the government of a territory, not to the people residing there&lt;/ref&gt; That government was granted a royal warrant to fly the Ulster Banner in 1924, but this expired when the government was dissolved under the [[Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973]]. It continues to be used by some sports teams representing Northern Ireland internationally, for example by the [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland football team]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.fifa.com/associations/association=nir/index.html|title= Northern Ireland|author= |accessdate=5 October 2011 |work= [[FIFA]]|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the Northern Ireland [[Commonwealth Games]] team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commonwealthgames.com/ Commonwealth Games website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723215731/http://www.commonwealthgames.com/ |date=23 July 2008 }}. Choose "Northern Ireland" from the "Countries" menu.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[flag of Ireland]] or Irish tricolour is the [[State (polity)|state]] flag of the [[Republic of Ireland]], and is regarded by [[Irish republicanism|republicans]] and nationalists as the flag of all of [[Ireland]].
*Other flags flown by socialist republicans include the [[Starry Plough (flag)|Starry Plough]], the [[Sunburst flag]] and even the [[flag of Ulster|flag of the Ulster province]]. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalists]] sometimes display the [[flag of Scotland]] as a sign of their Scottish ancestry. [[Ulster nationalism|Ulster nationalists]] use the unofficial [[List of flags used in Northern Ireland#Ulster Nation flag|'Ulster Nation flag']], although it has now been adopted as an [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster-Scots]] flag.

==Controversies==
The [[Flags and Emblems (Display) Act (Northern Ireland) 1954]] prohibited the display of any flag which was "likely to cause a breach of public order", and gave the police powers to deal with it. However, it specifically excluded the [[Union Jack|Union flag]] from its provisions.&lt;ref name="Hylland Eriksen"&gt;Thomas Hylland Eriksen and Richard Jenkins, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=scHXHTkRmZcC&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Flag, Nation and Symbolism in Europe and America]'', Routledge, 2007, {{ISBN|1134066961}}, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1964, the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] moved in to remove an [[Flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]] from the window of an office in [[Belfast]], after [[Ian Paisley]] had publicly said that if they did not, he would do so personally. This resulted in serious rioting.&lt;ref name="Hylland Eriksen"/&gt; The Act was repealed in 1987.

In some loyalist areas the flying of flags supporting loyalist paramilitaries has proved controversial. Groups like the [[Ulster Defence Association]], [[Ulster Volunteer Force]], [[Young Citizen Volunteers (1972)|Young Citizen Volunteers]], [[Red Hand Commando]], and [[Loyalist Volunteer Force]] all have their own unique flags and although these flags usually appear alongside murals, they can occasionally be seen flying from lampposts in villages and towns or flying from houses in the run up to [[the Twelfth]].

Some local councils have debated the usage of the Tricolour. In 2002 [[Belfast City Council]] displayed the Tricolour along with the Union Flag in the Lord Mayor's parlour during the term of [[Sinn Féin]] Lord Mayor [[Alex Maskey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tricolour raised in City Hall | author = | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/2236626.stm | publisher = BBC | date = 4 September 2002 | accessdate = 2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different approach was taken in 1997; when the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]]'s (SDLP) [[Alban Maginness]] was [[Lord Mayor]], neither flag was displayed. In September 2003, Belfast City Council discussed flying the Tricolour alongside the Union Flag on designated occasions.

The Ulster Banner continues to be used by some local governments, such as the predominantly unionist [[Castlereagh (borough)|Castlereagh]], which flies it outside its offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Castlereagh |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=BT8+6RB&amp;sll=54.573057,-5.883522&amp;sspn=0.092342,0.33577&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Belfast,+County+Antrim+BT8+6RB,+United+Kingdom&amp;ll=54.565041,-5.908547&amp;spn=0.000728,0.003645&amp;z=19&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=54.565011,-5.90838&amp;panoid=scerOoEYaPbz-HoxX-xQtA&amp;cbp=12,29.55,,0,0.6 |title=Castlereagh Borough Council, Northern Ireland |publisher=Maps.google.com |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A decision in December 2012 to fly the Union flag over [[Belfast City Hall]] only on certain designated days, instead of all the year round as previously, led to the [[Belfast City Hall flag protests]], which included riots in which police officers were injured.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20652968 Belfast flag protests: Loyalists clash with police after rally], BBC, 8 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern Ireland flags controversy has led to [[Unicode]] being unable to release an equivalent country [[emoji]] for Northern Ireland, as it has for Scotland, England, Wales, and the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstalk.com/Why-is-there-no-Northern-Irish-flag-in-the-new-Emoji-update|title=Why is there no Northern Irish flag in the new Emoji update?|date=31 March 2017|accessdate=6 October 2017|last=Dempsey|first=James|work=News Talk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haass talks==
In 2013, US diplomat [[Richard Haass]] chaired talks between the political parties in Northern Ireland dealing with, among other things, the issue of flags. The resulting draft proposals, which were not agreed by the parties, included the idea of a new flag for Northern Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/haass-proposes-new-body-to-investigate-troubles-killings-1.1629610 Haass proposes new body to investigate Troubles killings], ''Irish Times'', 16 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and the possibility of a "circumscribed role for the sovereign flag of Ireland in conjunction with the Union flag."&lt;ref&gt;John Mulgrew, "[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/final-draft-on-dealing-with-northern-irelands-past-released-after-failure-on-agreement-29878841.html Final draft on dealing with Northern Ireland's past released after failure on agreement]", ''Belfast Telegraph'', 31 December 2013.

The '''People's Party''' ({{lang-sr|Народна странка}}, НС / ''Narodna stranka, '''NS''''') is a [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservative]] [[List of political parties in Serbia|political party in Serbia]]. It is a [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] political organization in [[Serbia]], founded after [[Serbian presidential election, 2017|2017 presidential elections]], by Vuk Jeremić. The party currently has three members serving in the [[National Assembly (Serbia)|National Assembly]].

== History ==
After his unsuccessful bid in an attempt to replace [[Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-Moon]] as [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] in the end of 2016, he returned to [[Serbia]], where he enjoyed relatively high approval ratings compared to other opposition politicians. He decided to run for president in [[Serbian presidential election, 2017|2017 presidential election]], declining the option to support [[Saša Janković]], who by then managed to gather a number of parties' support. Although many thought that opposition would have better chances against [[Aleksandar Vučić|Vučić]] if united, and considered Janković a better option for a single opposition presidential candidate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/vesti/politika/predsednicki-izbori-jankovic-jaci-kandidat-opozicije-od-jeremica/cphqyfq|title=Janković jači kandidat opozicije od Jeremića|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Jeremić announced his candidacy nevertheless&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/vesti/politika/prelomio-jeremic-odlucio-da-se-kandiduje-za-predsednika-srbije/wwylq6l|title=Jeremić odlučio da se kandiduje za predsednika Srbije|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He finished fourth, with little less than 6% of the vote. 

In the aftermath of the election, though his results were quite disappointing, he announced he will form a party. He gathered support for such move mainly from conservative intellectuals who were opposing Vučić's government, and were previously tied with [[Democratic Party of Serbia|DSS]] (most notably [[Sanda Rašković Ivić|Sanda Rašković-Ivić]], a former DSS president). He formed the People's Party in October 2017. The People's Party was able to forgo the usual registration process for new parties when [[Miroslav Aleksić (People's Party politician)|Miroslav Aleksić]], a member of the National Assembly, allowed his [[People's Movement of Serbia]] to be re-registered and re-constituted under the new party name. Representatives of the People's Party indicated that this removed the threat of the name being stolen during the registration process.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2017&amp;mm=09&amp;dd=28&amp;nav_category=11&amp;nav_id=1308310 "'Blic': Jeremić u oktobru osniva Narodnu stranku], B92, 28 September 2017, accessed 20 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of December 2017, there are three members of the People's Party serving in the National Assembly, although they do not serve as a unified parliamentary bloc. Aleksić, who was selected as first vice-president of the People's Party at its founding convention, has served in a parliamentary alliance with [[Boris Tadić]]'s [[Social Democratic Party (Serbia)|Social Democratic Party]] since 2016 and is the deputy leader of the grouping.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics.php?yyyy=2017&amp;mm=10&amp;dd=23&amp;nav_id=102620 "Former FM Jeremic becomes leader of newly founded party"], B92, 23 October 2017, accessed 20 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlament.rs/national-assembly/composition/parliamentary-groups.112.498.html Social Democratic Party, People’s Movement of Serbia Parliamentary Group], National Assembly of Serbia, accessed 26 January 2017 and 20 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Rašković Ivić, who was selected as one of five deputy vice-presidents at the same convention, is the current leader of the [[New Serbia]]–Movement for Serbia's Salvation group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlament.gov.rs/national-assembly/composition/parliamentary-groups/parliamentary-groups.116.498.html New Serbia – Movement For Serbia’s Salvation Parliamentary Group], National Assembly of Serbia, accessed 27 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dijana Vukomanović]], a former member of the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] who now serves on the presidency of the People's Party,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.narodna.org.rs/o-nama/predsednistvo Председништво Народне странке], People's Party, accessed 5 December 2017.

Stojanović, "Vukomanović: Narodna stranka će umiriti borbu desnice i levice"], ''Danas'', 29 September 2017, accessed 5 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; is also a member of the New Serbia–Movement for Serbia's Salvation caucus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parlament.rs/DIJANA_VUKOMANOVIC+.627.488.html DIJANA Dr VUKOMANOVIC], National Assembly of Serbia, accessed 5 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another member of the National Assembly, [[Đorđe Vukadinović|Đorđe Vukadinovć]] is also closely tied to the party, and supported it since its inception. He was elected as part of the same list as Sanda Rašković-Ivić (Dveri-[[Democratic Party of Serbia|DSS]]) but later went independent.

Despite competing against each other in the presidential election, Jeremić's party now cooperates closely with the [[Movement of Free Citizens (Serbia)|Movement of Free Citizens]], a party formed by Janković, after the election.

== Political position ==
Since its inception the party has positioned itself as an opposition party to the government, led by [[Serbian Progressive Party]] (SNS).

Jeremić stated he is a pro-[[European Union|EU]] politician, but he opposes Serbia joining [[NATO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.danas.rs/politika.56.html?news_id=360884&amp;title=Jeremi%C4%87%3A+Uprkos+krizi+EU%2C+nama+je+potrebno+evropsko+dru%C5%A1tvo|title=Jeremić: Uprkos krizi EU, nama je potrebno evropsko društvo|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rs.n1info.com/a342381/Vesti/Vesti/Jeremic-Vojnu-neutralnost-uneti-u-Ustav.html|title=Jeremić: Nikad u NATO, vojna neutralnost da se unese u Ustav|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, the [[Chinese Civil War]] between the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and the Government of the Republic of China had resumed, in response of the war, the first session of the [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] convened in 1948 enacted the "Mobilization for the Suppression of Communist Rebellion Provisional Act". The Provisional Act is provided to the then President [[Chiang Kai-shek]] extended powers to mobilize against the CCP. After the central government of the Republic of China had relocated to Taiwan in 1949, the Provisional Act provided the government ways to suppress its opponents.

{{Discrimination sidebar}}

'''Racism''' is the belief in the [[Supremacism|superiority]] of one race over another, which often results in [[discrimination]] and [[prejudice]] towards people based on their [[race (human categorization)|race]] or [[ethnicity]]. As of the 2000s, the use of the term "racism" does not easily fall under a single definition.&lt;ref name="Garner09"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/racisms/book245769 | title=Racisms: An Introduction | publisher=Sage | author=Garner, Steve | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ideology]] underlying racism often includes the idea that humans can be subdivided into distinct groups that are different due to their social behavior and their innate capacities as well as the idea that they can be ranked as inferior or superior.&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;{{cite book | last = Newman | first = D. M. | title = Sociology: exploring the architecture of everyday life | publisher = SAGE | location = Los Angeles | year = 2012 | edition = 9th | isbn = 978-1-4129-8729-5 | page = 405 | quote = racism: Belief that humans are subdivided into distinct groups that are different in their social behavior and innate capacities and that can be ranked as superior or inferior.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical examples of [[institutional racism]] include the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], the [[apartheid]] regime in [[South Africa]], [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation in the United States]], and [[slavery in Latin America]]. Racism was also an aspect of the social organization of many colonial states and empires.

While the concepts of race and ethnicity are considered to be separate in contemporary [[social science]], the two terms have a long history of equivalence in both popular usage and older social science literature. "Ethnicity" is often used in a sense close to one traditionally attributed to "race": the division of human groups based on qualities assumed to be essential or innate to the group (e.g. shared ancestry or shared behavior). Therefore, ''racism'' and ''[[racial discrimination]]'' are often used to describe discrimination on an ethnic or cultural basis, independent of whether these differences are described as racial. According to a [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|convention on racial discrimination]], there is no distinction between the terms "racial" and "ethnic" discrimination. The UN convention further concludes that superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous, and there is no justification for racial discrimination, anywhere, in theory or in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CERD.aspx|title=International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racist ideology can become manifest in many aspects of social life. Racism can be present in [[social actions]], practices, or [[Political science|political systems]] (e.g., [[apartheid]]) that support the expression of prejudice or aversion in discriminatory practices. Associated social actions may include [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]], [[xenophobia]], [[Othering|otherness]], [[Racial segregation|segregation]], [[hierarchical]] ranking, [[supremacism]], and related social phenomena.

==Etymology, definition and usage==
{{Race}}
[[File:ProceedingsLakeMohonkConference.png|thumb|An early use of the word "racism" by [[Richard Henry Pratt]] in 1902: "''Association of races and classes is necessary to destroy racism and [[Class discrimination|classism]].''"]]
In the 19th century, many scientists subscribed to the belief that the human population can be divided into races. The term ''racism'' is a noun describing the state of being racist, i.e., subscribing to the belief that the human population can or should be classified into races with differential abilities and dispositions, which in turn may motivate a political ideology in which rights and privileges are differentially distributed based on racial categories. The origin of the root word "race" is not clear. Linguists generally agree that it came to the English language from [[Middle French]], but there is no such agreement on how it came into Latin-based languages, generally. A recent proposal is that it derives from the [[Arabic]] ''ra's'', which means "head, beginning, origin" or the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''rosh'', which has a similar meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=race&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 |title=race (n2) |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early race theorists generally held the view that some races were inferior to others and they consequently believed that the differential treatment of races was fully justified.&lt;ref name="Garner09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Canadian Encyclo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/racism/ |title=Racism |website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=21 February 2016 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/combating_discrimination/l33178_en.htm|website=Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA of 28 November 2008|publisher=European Union|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm |website=UN Treaty Series |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=3 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DocT4xh?url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm |archivedate=26 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These early theories guided [[Pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] research assumptions; the collective endeavors to adequately define and form hypotheses about racial differences are generally termed [[scientific racism]], though this term is a misnomer due to the lack of any actual science backing the claims.

Today, most [[Biology|biologists]], [[Anthropology|anthropologists]], and [[Sociology|sociologists]] reject a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of races in favor of more specific and/or empirically verifiable criteria, such as [[geography]], ethnicity or a history of [[endogamy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Does Race Exist? |journal=Scientific American |date=December 2003 |first=Michael |last=Bamshad |author2=Steve E.

An entry in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2008) simply defines [[racialism]] as "An earlier term than racism, but now largely superseded by it," and cites it in a 1902 quote.&lt;ref&gt;"racialism, n." [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/157084 OED Online]. September 2013. Oxford University Press. (Accessed December 03, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The revised Oxford English Dictionary cites the shortened term "racism" in a quote from the following year, 1903.&lt;ref&gt;"racism, n." [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/157097 OED Online]. September 2013. Oxford University Press. (Accessed December 03, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rm42"&gt;{{cite book |last=Miles |first=Robert |title=Racism |url=https://books.google.com/?id=J9AOAAAAQAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-01809-8|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first defined by the Oxford English Dictionary (2nd edition, 1989) as "[t]he theory that distinctive human characteristics and abilities are determined by race"; the same dictionary termed ''racism'' a [[synonym]] of ''racialism'': "belief in the superiority of a particular race". By the end of [[World War II]], ''racism'' had acquired the same supremacist connotations formerly associated with ''racialism'': ''racism'' now implied racial [[discrimination]], racial [[supremacism]] and a harmful intent. (The term "race hatred" had also been used by sociologist [[Frederick Hertz]] in the late 1920s.)

As its history indicates, the popular use of the word ''racism'' is relatively recent. The word came into widespread usage in the [[Western world]] in the 1930s, when it was used to describe the social and political ideology of [[Nazism]], which saw "race" as a naturally given political unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7243.html |title=Racism: A Short History |publisher=Princeton University Press |author=Fredrickson, George M. |year=2002 |location=Princeton, NJ |page=5 |isbn=9780691116525 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308115725/http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7243.html |archivedate=2016-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly agreed that racism existed before the coinage of the word, but there is not a wide agreement on a single definition of what racism is and what it is not. Today, some scholars of racism prefer to use the concept in the plural ''racisms'' in order to emphasize its many different forms that do not easily fall under a single definition and they also argue that different forms of racism have characterized different historical periods and geographical areas.&lt;ref name="Bethen14"&gt;{{cite book |title=Racisms: From the Crusades to the Twentieth Century |publisher=Princeton University Press |author=Bethencourt, Francisco |year=2014 |location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garner (2009: p.&amp;nbsp;11) summarizes different existing definitions of racism and identifies three common elements contained in those definitions of racism. First, a historical, hierarchical [[Power (social and political)|power]] relationship between groups; second, a set of ideas (an ideology) about racial differences; and, third, discriminatory actions (practices).&lt;ref name="Garner09"/&gt;

===Legal===
Though many countries around the globe have passed [[law]]s related to race and discrimination, the first significant international [[human rights]] instrument developed by the [[United Nations]] (UN) was the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR).&lt;ref name="UNUDHR"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html |title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UDHR was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1948. The UDHR recognizes that if people are to be treated with dignity, they require [[economic rights]], [[civil rights|social rights]] including [[education]], and the rights to [[culture|cultural]] and [[politics|political]] participation and [[Civil liberties|civil liberty]]. It further states that everyone is entitled to these rights "without distinction of any kind, such as race, [[Human skin color|colour]], [[sex]], [[language]], [[religion]], political or other opinion, [[Nationality|national]] or [[society|social]] origin, property, birth or other status."

The UN does not define "racism"; however, it does define "racial discrimination": According to the 1965 UN [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]],&lt;ref name="UNICERD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CERD.aspx |title=International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination |publisher=United Nations. Adopted December 1965, entered into force January 1969 |accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;the term "racial discrimination" shall mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference based on race, colour, [[Cultural heritage|descent]], or national or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their 1978 [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]] Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice (Article 1), the UN states, "All human beings belong to a single species and are descended from a common stock. They are born equal in dignity and rights and all form an integral part of humanity."&lt;ref name="UNESCO78"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13161&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |title=Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice |publisher=United Nations |date=1978 |accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN definition of racial discrimination does not make any distinction between discrimination based on ethnicity and race, in part because the distinction between the two has been a matter of debate among [[academia|academics]], including [[Anthropology|anthropologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Metraux |first1=A. |year=1950 |title=United nations Economic and Security Council Statement by Experts on Problems of Race |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=53 |issue=1|pages=142–45 |doi=10.1525/aa.1951.53.1.02a00370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Law of the United Kingdom|British law]] the phrase ''racial group'' means "any group of people who are defined by reference to their race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/prosecution/rrpbcrbook.html |title=Racist and Religious Crime – CPS Prosecution Policy |publisher=The CPS |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Norway]], the word "race" has been removed from national laws concerning discrimination because the use of the phrase is considered problematic and unethical.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Dagsland Holgersen (23 July 2010) [http://www.aftenposten.no/norge/Rasebegrepet-pa-vei-ut-av-loven-215256b.html Rasebegrepet på vei ut av loven] ''[[Aftenposten]]''.

===Social and behavioral sciences===
{{Main|Sociology of race and ethnic relations}}
[[Sociology|Sociologists]], in general, recognize "race" as a [[Social constructivism|social construct]]. This means that, although the concepts of race and racism are based on observable biological characteristics, any conclusions drawn about race on the basis of those observations are heavily influenced by cultural ideologies. Racism, as an ideology, exists in a society at both the [[individual]] and [[institution]]al level.

While much of the research and work on racism during the last half-century or so has concentrated on "white racism" in the Western world, historical accounts of race-based social practices can be found across the globe.&lt;ref name=Gossett&gt;Gossett, Thomas F. ''Race: The History of an Idea in America''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0195097785}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, racism can be broadly defined to encompass individual and group prejudices and acts of discrimination that result in material and cultural advantages conferred on a majority or a dominant social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Racist America: Roots, Current Realities, and Future Reparations |publisher=Routledge |author=Feagin, Joe R. |year=2000 |isbn=9780415925310}}&lt;/ref&gt; So-called "white racism" focuses on societies in which white populations are the majority or the dominant social group. In studies of these majority white societies, the aggregate of material and cultural advantages is usually termed "[[white privilege]]".

Race and race relations are prominent areas of study in [[sociology]] and [[economics]]. Much of the sociological literature focuses on white racism. Some of the earliest sociological works on racism were penned by sociologist [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], the first African American to earn a doctoral degree from [[Harvard University]]. Du Bois wrote, "The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the [[color line (civil rights issue)|color line]]."&lt;ref name="DuBois03"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Souls of Black Folk |publisher=Bantam Classic |author1=Du Bois |author2=W. E. B. |year=1903 |location=New York|title-link=The Souls of Black Folk }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wellman (1993) defines racism as "culturally sanctioned beliefs, which, regardless of intentions involved, defend the advantages whites have because of the subordinated position of racial minorities".&lt;ref name="Wellman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wellman |first=David T. |title=Portraits of White Racism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1993 |location=New York, NY |page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both sociology and economics, the outcomes of racist actions are often measured by the [[Social inequality|inequality]] in [[income]], [[wealth]], [[net worth]], and access to other cultural resources, such as education, between racial groups.&lt;ref name="Massey89"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hypersegregation in U.S. Metropolitan areas: Black and Hispanic Segregation Along Five Dimensions |author1=Massey, D. |author2=N. Denton |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Demography |year=1989 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=378–79 |doi=10.2307/2061599 |jstor=2061599 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sociology and [[social psychology]], [[Identity (social science)|racial identity]] and the acquisition of that identity, is often used as a variable in racism studies. Racial ideologies and racial identity affect individuals' perception of race and discrimination. Cazenave and Maddern (1999) define racism as "a highly organized system of 'race'-based group privilege that operates at every level of society and is held together by a sophisticated ideology of color/'race' supremacy. Racial centrality (the extent to which a culture recognizes individuals' racial identity) appears to affect the degree of discrimination African American young adults perceive whereas racial ideology may buffer the detrimental emotional effects of that discrimination.&lt;ref name="Cazenave"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Defending the White Race: White Male Faculty Opposition to a White Racism Course|author1=Cazenave, Noel A |author2=Darlene Alvarez Maddern |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Race and Society |year=1999 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=25–50 |doi=10.1016/s1090-9524(00)00003-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sellers and Shelton (2003) found that a relationship between racial discrimination and emotional distress was moderated by racial ideology and social beliefs.&lt;ref name="Sellers03"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The role of racial identity in perceived racial discrimination|author1=Sellers RM |author2=JN Shelton |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=2003 |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=1079–92 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.84.5.1079|pmid=12757150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sociologists also argue that, particularly in the West where racism is often [[Social control|negatively sanctioned]] in society, racism has changed from being a blatant to a more covert expression of racial prejudice. The "newer" (more hidden and less easily detectable) forms of racism—which can be considered embedded in social processes and structures—are more difficult to explore as well as challenge. It has been suggested that, while in many countries overt or explicit racism has become increasingly [[taboo]], even among those who display egalitarian explicit attitudes, an [[Implicit-association test|implicit]] or [[aversive racism]] is still maintained subconsciously.&lt;ref name="Greenwald" /&gt;

This process has been studied extensively in social psychology as implicit associations and [[implicit attitude]]s, a component of [[implicit cognition]]. Implicit attitudes are evaluations that occur without conscious awareness towards an attitude object or the self. These evaluations are generally either favorable or unfavorable. They come about from various influences in the individual experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Implicit attitudes 101: Theoretical and empirical Insights|last=Devos|first=T.|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2008|location=New York, NY|chapter=Attitudes and attitude change |pages=61–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implicit attitudes are not consciously identified (or they are inaccurately identified) traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feeling, thought, or action towards social objects.&lt;ref name="Greenwald"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greenwald |first1=A.G. |last2=Banaji |first2=M.R. |year=1995 |title=Implicit social cognition: Attitudes, self-esteem, and stereotypes |url=|journal=Psychological Review |volume=102 |issue=1|pages=4–27 |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.1.4 |pmid=7878162|citeseerx=10.1.1.304.6161 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These thoughts, feelings or actions have an influence on behavior of which the individual may not be aware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Gawronski|first1=B|last2=Payne|first2=B.K.|title=Handbook of Implicit Social Cognition: Measurement, Theory and Application|date=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8UiqBlGT7z4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=racism&amp;f=false|isbn=9781606236741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, subconscious racism can influence our visual processing and how our minds work when we are subliminally exposed to faces of different colors. In thinking about crime, for example, [[Social psychology|social psychologist]] [[Jennifer Eberhardt|Jennifer L. Eberhardt]] (2004) of [[Stanford University]] holds that, "blackness is so associated with crime you're ready to pick out these crime objects."&lt;ref name="Eberhardt04"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Seeing Black: Race, Crime, and Visual Processing |author=Eberhardt, Jennifer L. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=2004 |volume=87 |issue=6 |pages=876–93 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.6.876|display-authors=etal |pmid=15598112|citeseerx=10.1.1.408.3542 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such exposures influence our minds and they can cause subconscious racism in our behavior towards other people or even towards objects. Thus, racist thoughts and actions can arise from stereotypes and fears of which we are not aware.&lt;ref name="Eberhardt14"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=itTHBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=Racism+goes+beyond+prejudicial+discrimination+and+bigotry.+It+arises+from+stereotypes+and+fears+of+which+we+are+vastly+unaware.#v=onepage&amp;q=Racism%20goes%20beyond%20prejudicial%20discrimination%20and%20bigotry.%20It%20arises%20from%20stereotypes%20and%20fears%20of%20which%20we%20are%20vastly%20unaware.&amp;f=false |title=Drugs, Crime, and Justice |publisher=Sage |date=2014 |author=Belenko, Steven and [[Cassia Spohn]]|isbn=9781483312958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanities===
[[Language]], [[linguistics]] and [[discourse]] are active areas of study in the [[humanities]], along with [[literature]] and the [[The arts|arts]]. [[Discourse analysis]] seeks to reveal the meaning of race and the actions of racists through careful study of the ways in which these factors of human society are described and discussed in various written and oral works. Van Dijk (1992), for example, examines the different ways in which descriptions of racism and racist actions are depicted by the perpetrators of such actions as well as by their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analyzing Racism Through Discourse Analysis Some Methodological Reflections in Race and Ethnicity in Research Methods |publisher=Sage |author=Van Dijk, Tuen |year=1992 |location=Newbury Park, CA |pages=92–134 |isbn=978-0803950078}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that when descriptions of actions have negative implications for the majority, and especially for white elites, they are often seen as controversial and such controversial interpretations are typically marked with quotation marks or they are greeted with expressions of distance or doubt. The previously cited book, ''[[The Souls of Black Folk]]'' by W.E.B. Du Bois, represents early [[African-American literature]] that describes the author's experiences with racism when he was traveling in the [[Southern United States|South]] as an African American.

Much American fictional literature has focused on issues of racism and the black "racial experience" in the US, including works written by whites such as ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', and ''[[Imitation of Life (novel)|Imitation of Life]]'', or even the non-fiction work ''[[Black Like Me]]''. These books, and others like them, feed into what has been called the "[[white savior narrative in film]]", in which the heroes and heroines are white even though the story is about things that happen to black characters. [[Content analysis|Textual analysis]] of such writings can contrast sharply with black authors' descriptions of African Americans and their experiences in US society. African American writers have sometimes been portrayed in [[African-American studies]] as retreating from racial issues when they write about "[[Whiteness studies|whiteness]]", while others identify this as an African American literary tradition called "the literature of white estrangement", part of a multipronged effort to challenge and dismantle [[white supremacy]] in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Souls of White Folk: African American Writers Theorize Whiteness |publisher=The University Press of Mississippi |author=Watson, Veronica T. |year=2013 |location=Jackson, MS |page=137 |isbn=9781496802453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular usage===
According to dictionaries, the word is commonly used to describe prejudice and discrimination based on race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/racism|title=Definition of racism in English|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism|title=Definition of racism|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racism can also be said to describe a condition in society in which a dominant racial group benefits from the [[oppression]] of others, whether that group wants such benefits or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reverse-racism-isnt-a-thing_us_55d60a91e4b07addcb45da97 |title='Reverse Racism': 4 Myths That Need To Stop |date=26 August 2015 |accessdate=28 February 2016 |author=Blay, Zeba |publisher=Huffpost Black Voices}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foucauldian scholar Ladelle McWhorter in her 2009 book ''Racism and Sexual Oppression in Anglo-America: A Genealogy'' posits modern racism similarly, focusing on the notion of a dominant group, usually whites, vying for racial purity and progress, rather than an overt or obvious ideology focused on the oppression of nonwhites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Racism and sexual oppression in Anglo-America: a genealogy |last=McWhorter |first=Ladelle |year=2009 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=9780253352965 |location=Bloomington |oclc=406565635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In popular usage, as in some academic usage, little distinction is made between "racism" and "[[ethnocentrism]]". Often, the two are listed together as "racial and ethnic" in describing some action or outcome that is associated with prejudice within a majority or dominant group in society. Furthermore, the meaning of the term racism is often conflated with the terms prejudice, [[bigotry]], and discrimination. Racism is a complex concept that can involve each of those, but it cannot be equated with nor is it synonymous with these other terms.

The term is often used in relation to what is seen as prejudice within a minority or subjugated group, as in the concept of [[reverse racism]]. "Reverse racism" is a concept often used to describe acts of discrimination or hostility against members of a dominant racial or ethnic group while favoring members of minority groups.&lt;ref name="Cashmore"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Cashmore |editor-first=Ellis |title=Encyclopedia of Race and Ethnic Studies |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-13-444706-0 |page=373 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=2L-5lBDPJJMC&amp;pg=PA373&amp;dq=%22reverse+racism%22 |chapter=Reverse Racism/Discrimination}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yee"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yee |first=June Ying |editor-last=Shaefer |editor-first=Richard T. |title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society |date=2008 |publisher=SAGE |isbn=978-1-41-292694-2 |pages=1118–19 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMUola6pDnkC&amp;pg=PT1244&amp;dq=%22reverse+racism%22 |chapter=Racism, Types of}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been used especially in the United States in debates over [[color-conscious]] policies (such as [[affirmative action]]) intended to remedy racial inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ansell |first=Amy Elizabeth |title=Race and Ethnicity: The Key Concepts |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_y3Q6fzgQAC&amp;q=%22reverse%20racism%22 |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33794-6 |chapter=Affirmative Action; Color-Consciousness |pages=4, 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those{{Who|date=January 2018}} who campaign for the interests of ethnic minorities commonly reject the concept of reverse racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Emily Torbett|title=Reverse racism: Can't exist by definition, insulting to minority groups|url=http://www.thedaonline.com/opinion/article_25e8b7cc-47bc-11e5-bb94-7f79b1590106.html |work=The Daily Athenaeum|accessdate=February 3, 2017|date=August 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars, also, commonly define racism not only in terms of individual prejudice, but also in terms of a power structure that protects the interests of the dominant culture and actively discriminates against ethnic minorities.{{refn|name=Cashmore}}{{refn|name=Yee}} From this perspective, while members of ethnic minorities may be prejudiced against members of the dominant culture, they lack the political and economic power to actively oppress them, and they are therefore not practicing "racism".{{refn|name=Cashmore}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ansell |first=Amy Elizabeth |title=Race and Ethnicity: The Key Concepts |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_y3Q6fzgQAC&amp;q=%22reverse%20racism%22 |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33794-6 |chapter=Reverse Racism |pages=135–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dennis"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dennis |first1=R.M. |editor1-last=Kuper |editor1-first=A. |editor2-last=Kuper |editor2-first=J. |title=The Social Science Encyclopedia, Volume 2 |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London; New York |isbn=978-1-13-435969-1 |edition=3rd |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=EiNiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2122&amp;dq=%22reverse+racism%22 |chapter=Racism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects==
The ideology underlying racism can become manifest in many aspects of social life. Such aspects are described in this section, although the list is not exhaustive.

===Aversive racism===
{{main|Aversive racism}}
Aversive racism is a form of implicit racism in which a person's unconscious negative evaluations of racial or ethnic minorities are realized by a persistent avoidance of interaction with other racial and ethnic groups. As opposed to traditional, overt racism, which is characterized by overt hatred for and explicit discrimination against racial/ethnic minorities, aversive racism is characterized by more complex, [[ambivalence|ambivalent]] expressions and attitudes.&lt;ref name="Gaertner"&gt;{{cite book |year=1986 |chapter=The aversive form of racism |pages=61–89 |editor1-first=John F. |editor1-last=Dovidio |editor2-first=Samuel L. |editor2-last=Gaertner |title=Prejudice, Discrimination and Racism |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-221425-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aversive racism is similar in implications to the concept of symbolic or modern racism (described below), which is also a form of implicit, unconscious, or covert attitude which results in unconscious forms of discrimination.

The term was coined by Joel Kovel to describe the subtle racial behaviors of any ethnic or racial group who rationalize their aversion to a particular group by appeal to rules or stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Gaertner"/&gt; People who behave in an aversively racial way may profess egalitarian beliefs, and will often deny their racially motivated behavior; nevertheless they change their behavior when dealing with a member of another race or ethnic group than the one they belong to. The motivation for the change is thought to be implicit or subconscious. Experiments have provided empirical support for the existence of aversive racism. Aversive racism has been shown to have potentially serious implications for decision making in employment, in legal decisions and in helping behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(04)36001-6 |chapter=Aversive Racism |title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |year=2004 |last1=Dovidio |first1=John F. |last2=Gaertner |first2=Samuel L. |isbn=978-0-12-015236-0 |volume=36 |pages=1–52 |editor1-first=James M. |editor1-last=Olson |editor2-first=Mark P. |editor2-last=Zanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0901_1 |title=Differences in Helping Whites and Blacks: A Meta-Analysis |year=2005 |last1=Saucier |first1=Donald A. |last2=Miller |first2=Carol T. |last3=Doucet |first3=Nicole |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review |volume=9 |pages=2–16 |pmid=15745861 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Color blindness===
{{main|Color blindness (race)}}
In relation to racism, Color blindness is the disregard of racial characteristics in [[social interaction]], for example in the rejection of affirmative action, as way to address the results of past patterns of discrimination. Critics of this attitude argue that by refusing to attend to racial disparities, racial color blindness in fact unconsciously perpetuates the patterns that produce racial inequality.&lt;ref name="Ansell 2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ansell |first=Amy E. |editor-last=Schaefer |editor-first=Richard T. |title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity, and Society |date=2008 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-1-45-226586-5 |pages=320–322 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=STR1AwAAQBAJ&amp;q=%22color+blindness%22 |chapter=Color Blindness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eduardo Bonilla-Silva]] argues that color blind racism arises from an "abstract [[liberalism]], biologization of culture, naturalization of racial matters, and minimization of racism".&lt;ref name="Bonilla-Silva"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bonilla-Silva | first = Eduardo | authorlink = Eduardo Bonilla-Silva | title= White Supremacy and Racism in the Post-Civil Rights Era | publisher = Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc| year = 2001 | pages = 137–66 | isbn = 978-1-58826-032-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Color blind practices are "subtle, [[institution]]al, and apparently nonracial"&lt;ref name=Bonilla-Silva1&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonilla-Silva|first=Eduardo|title=Racism without Racists: Color-blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States|year=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield| location=Lanham| isbn=978-0-7425-1633-5| pages=2–29| url=https://books.google.com/?id=6IG7QgAACAAJ&amp;dq=racism+without+racists}}&lt;/ref&gt; because race is explicitly ignored in decision making. If race is disregarded in predominately white populations, for example, whiteness becomes the [[norm (social)|normative]] standard, whereas [[people of color]] are [[Othering|othered]], and the racism these individuals experience may be minimized or erased.&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Race Is – Race Isn't: Critical Race Theory and Qualitative Studies in Education |last=Parker |first=Laurence |year=1999 |publisher=Westview Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8133-9069-7 |page=184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Social"&gt;{{cite book | title=Our Social World: Introduction to Sociology (Condensed Version) | publisher=SAGE | year=2015 | location=Los Angeles | isbn=9781452275758 | first1=Jeanne H. | last1=Ballantine | first2=Keith A. | last2=Roberts | edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an individual level, people with "color blind prejudice" reject racist ideology, but also reject systemic policies intended to fix [[institutional racism]].&lt;ref name="Social" /&gt;

===Cultural===
{{see also|Xenophobia}}
Cultural racism is a term used to describe and explain new racial ideologies and practices that have emerged since World War II. It can be defined as societal beliefs and customs that promote the assumption that the products of a given culture, including the language and traditions of that culture are superior to those of other cultures. It shares a great deal with [[xenophobia]], which is often characterised by fear of, or aggression toward, members of an [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] by members of an [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]].{{Citation needed|reason=are these definitions from the same Wren article, or maybe from Blaut's?|date=June 2018}}

Cultural racism exists when there is a widespread acceptance of stereotypes concerning different ethnic or population groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cultural racism: Something rotten in the state of Denmark?|journal=Social &amp; Cultural Geography|doi=10.1080/14649360120047788|first=Karen|last=Wren|volume=2|issue=2|year=2001|pages=141–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where racism can be characterised by the belief that one race is inherently superior to another, cultural racism can be characterised by the belief that one culture is inherently superior to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~lnp3/mydocs/Blaut/racism.htm|title=The Theory of Cultural Racism|journal=Antipode: A Radical Journal of Geography|volume=24|issue=4|year=1992|pages=289–99|first=James M.|last=Blaut|authorlink=James Morris Blaut|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8330.1992.tb00448.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===

[[File:Boycot Jews april 1 1933.jpeg|thumb|[[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses]], Germany, 1933]]

Historical economic or social disparity is alleged to be a form of [[discrimination]] caused by past racism and historical reasons, affecting the present generation through deficits in the formal education and kinds of preparation in previous generations, and through primarily unconscious racist attitudes and actions on members of the general population.

In 2011, [[Bank of America]] agreed to pay $335&amp;nbsp;million to settle a federal government claim that its mortgage division, Countrywide Financial, [[Mortgage discrimination|discriminated]] against black and Hispanic homebuyers.&lt;ref name="america"&gt;{{cite news|title=Countrywide Will Settle a Bias Suit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/business/us-settlement-reported-on-countrywide-lending.html|date=December 21, 2011|first=Charlie|last=Savage|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Colonial spain|Spanish colonial period]], Spaniards developed a complex [[Castas|caste system]] based on race, which was used for social control and which also determined a person's importance in society.&lt;ref name="Acuña-p23-24"&gt;{{cite book| last = Acuña| first = Rodolfo F.| authorlink = Rodolfo F.

Mexico's in Denial.]", The New York Times, June 11, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional===
{{Further|Institutional racism|State racism|Racial profiling|Racism by country}}
[[Institutional racism]] (also known as structural racism, [[state racism]] or systemic racism) is racial discrimination by governments, corporations, religions, or educational institutions or other large organizations with the power to influence the lives of many individuals. [[Stokely Carmichael]] is credited for coining the phrase ''institutional racism'' in the late 1960s. He defined the term as "the collective failure of an organization to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin".&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Race, [http://www.shef.ac.uk/socstudies/Shop/race_article.pdf Analysing ethnic education policy-making in England and Wales], ''Sheffield Online Papers in Social Research'', University of Sheffield, p. 12. Retrieved 20 June 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923102013/http://www.shef.ac.uk/socstudies/Shop/race_article.pdf |date=September 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maulana Karenga]] argued that racism constituted the destruction of culture, language, religion, and human possibility and that the effects of racism were "the morally monstrous destruction of human possibility involved redefining African humanity to the world, poisoning past, present and future relations with others who only know us through this stereotyping and thus damaging the truly human relations among peoples".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karenga|first1=Maulana|title=The Ethics of Reparations: Engaging the Holocaust of Enslavement|url=http://www.ncobraonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Karenga-THE-ETHICS-OF-REPARATIONS.pdf|publisher=[[The National Coalition of Blacks for Reparations in America]] (N'COBRA)|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=22–23 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Othering===
{{main|Othering}}
Othering is the term used by some to describe a system of discrimination whereby the characteristics of a group are used to distinguish them as separate from the norm.&lt;ref&gt;Mountz, Alison. (2009) ''Key Concepts in Political Geography.'' SAGE. p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;

Othering plays a fundamental role in the history and continuation of racism. To objectify a culture as something different, exotic or underdeveloped is to generalize that it is not like 'normal' society. Europe's colonial attitude towards the Orient exemplifies this as it was thought that the East was the opposite of the West; feminine where the West was masculine, weak where the West was strong and traditional where the West was progressive.&lt;ref name="Said, Edward 1978 pp.357"&gt;Said, Edward. (1978) ''Orientalism''. New York: Pantheon Books. p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; By making these generalizations and othering the East, Europe was simultaneously defining herself as the norm, further entrenching the gap.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Derek. (2004). ''The Colonial Present''. Blackwell publishers. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the process of othering relies on imagined difference, or the expectation of difference. Spatial difference can be enough to conclude that "we" are "here" and the "others" are over "there".&lt;ref name="Said, Edward 1978 pp.357"/&gt; Imagined differences serve to categorize people into groups and assign them characteristics that suit the imaginer's expectations.&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. (1978) ''Orientalism''. New York: Pantheon Books. p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial discrimination===
{{Main|Racial discrimination}}
Racial discrimination refers to [[discrimination]] against someone on the basis of their race.

===Racial segregation===

Racial segregation is the separation of humans into [[Race (human categorization)|socially-constructed racial groups]] in daily life. It may apply to activities such as eating in a restaurant, drinking from a water fountain, using a bath room, attending school, going to the movies, or in the rental or purchase of a home.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles to Guide Housing Policy at the Beginning of the Millennium'', Michael Schill &amp; Susan Wachter, [[Cityscape]]&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation is generally outlawed, but may exist through social norms, even when there is no strong individual preference for it, as suggested by [[Thomas Schelling]]'s models of segregation and subsequent work.

===Symbolic/modern===
{{Main|Symbolic racism}}
[[File:Little Rock integration protest.jpg|thumb|left|A rally against [[Desegregation busing|school integration]] in 1959.]]
Some scholars argue that in the US earlier violent and aggressive forms of racism have evolved into a more subtle form of prejudice in the late 20th century. This new form of racism is sometimes referred to as "modern racism" and it is characterized by outwardly acting unprejudiced while inwardly maintaining prejudiced attitudes, displaying subtle prejudiced behaviors such as actions informed by attributing qualities to others based on racial stereotypes, and evaluating the same behavior differently based on the race of the person being evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., &amp; Akert, R. M. (2010). ''Social Psychology'' (7th edition). New York: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; This view is based on studies of prejudice and discriminatory behavior, where some people will act ambivalently towards black people, with positive reactions in certain, more public contexts, but more negative views and expressions in more private contexts. This ambivalence may also be visible for example in hiring decisions where job candidates that are otherwise positively evaluated may be unconsciously disfavored by employers in the final decision because of their race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McConahay | first1 = J.

B. (1986). Modern racism, ambivalence, and the modern racism scale.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars consider modern racism to be characterized by an explicit rejection of stereotypes, combined with resistance to changing structures of discrimination for reasons that are ostensibly non-racial, an ideology that considers opportunity at a purely individual basis denying the relevance of race in determining individual opportunities and the exhibition of indirect forms of micro-aggression toward and/or avoidance of people of other races.&lt;ref&gt;Pettigrew, T. F. (1989). "The nature of modern racism in the United States". ''Revue Internationale de Psychologie Sociale''.
Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subconscious biases===
Recent research has shown that individuals who consciously claim to reject racism may still exhibit race-based subconscious biases in their decision-making processes. While such "subconscious racial biases" do not fully fit the definition of racism, their impact can be similar, though typically less pronounced, not being explicit, conscious or deliberate.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (March 30, 2015) [http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/biases-back-mind-affect-feel-race/ "How the biases in the back of your mind affect how you feel about race"] ''[[PBS Newshour]]'' Accessed: October 9, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law and racial discrimination==
In 1919, a [[Racial Equality Proposal, 1919|proposal]] to include a racial equality provision in the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]] was supported by a majority, but not adopted in the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]]. In 1943, Japan and its allies declared work for the abolition of racial discrimination to be their aim at the [[Greater East Asia Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C. Peter Chen |url=http://ww2db.com/battle_spec.php?battle_id=70%20WW2DB:%20Greater%20East%20Asia%20Conference |title=Joint Declaration of the Greater East Asia Conference (below) |publisher=Ww2db.com |date=1945-02-23 |accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1 of the 1945 [[UN Charter]] includes "promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race" as UN purpose.

In 1950, [[UNESCO]] suggested in ''[[The Race Question]]''—a statement signed by 21 scholars such as [[Ashley Montagu]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Gunnar Myrdal]], [[Julian Huxley]], etc.—to "drop the term ''race'' altogether and instead speak of [[ethnic groups]]". The statement condemned [[scientific racism]] theories that had played a role in [[the Holocaust]]. It aimed both at debunking scientific racist theories, by popularizing modern knowledge concerning "the race question," and morally condemned racism as contrary to the philosophy of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and its assumption of [[Social equality|equal rights]] for all. Along with Myrdal's ''[[An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy]]'' (1944), ''The Race Question'' influenced the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court [[racial segregation in the United States|desegregation]] decision in "[[Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka]]".&lt;ref name="Prins"&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=30431&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html "Toward a World without Evil: Alfred Métraux as UNESCO Anthropologist (1946–1962)"], by [[Harald E.L. Prins]], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1950, the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] was adopted, widely used on racial discrimination issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/2F848EFD-6B29-43E5-BB1C-497CD77BB2BF/0/FICHES_Racial_discrimination_EN.pdf |title=European Court of Human Rights case law factsheet on racial discrimination |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614002623/http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/2F848EFD-6B29-43E5-BB1C-497CD77BB2BF/0/FICHES_Racial_discrimination_EN.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations use the definition of racial discrimination laid out in the ''[[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]]'', adopted in 1966:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...&amp;nbsp;any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin that has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.

International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm Text of the Convention] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726053246/http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/cerd.htm |date=July 26, 2011 }}, ''[[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]]'', 1966&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2001, the [[European Union]] explicitly banned racism, along with many other forms of social discrimination, in the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]], the legal effect of which, if any, would necessarily be limited to [[Institutions of the European Union]]: "Article 21 of the charter prohibits discrimination on any ground such as race, color, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, disability, age or sexual orientation and also discrimination on the grounds of nationality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lbr.nl/internationaal/charter%20uk.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112114651/http://www.lbr.nl/internationaal/charter%20uk.html|date=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racism existed during the 19th century as "[[scientific racism]]", which attempted to provide a [[typology (anthropology)|racial classification]] of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-André Taguieff]], ''La force du préjugé'', 1987 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1775 [[Johann Blumenbach]] divided the world's population into five groups according to skin color (Caucasians, Mongols, etc.), positing the view that the non-caucasians had arisen through a process of degeneration. Another early view in scientific racism was the [[Polygenism|polygenist view]], which held that the different races had been separately created. Polygenist [[Christoph Meiners]] for example, split mankind into two divisions which he labeled the "beautiful White race" and the "ugly Black race". In Meiners' book, ''The Outline of History of Mankind'', he claimed that a main characteristic of race is either beauty or ugliness. He viewed only the white race as beautiful. He considered ugly races to be inferior, immoral and animal-like.

[[Anders Retzius]] demonstrated that neither Europeans nor others are one "pure race", but of mixed origins. While [[Typology (anthropology)#Typology|discredited]], derivations of Blumenbach's taxonomy are [[Definitions of whiteness in the United States|still widely used]] for the classification of the population in the United States. [[:dk::Hans Petter Steensby|H. P. Steensby]], while strongly emphasizing that all humans today are of mixed origins, in 1907 claimed that the origins of human differences must be traced extraordinarily far back in time, and conjectured that the "purest race" today would be the [[Australian Aboriginals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://img.kb.dk/tidsskriftdk/pdf/gto/gto_0019-PDF/gto_0019_67206.pdf |title=Race Studies in Denmark |journal=[[Danish Journal of Geography|Geografisk Tidsskrift]] |volume=19 |language=Danish |year=1907 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific racism fell strongly out of favor in the early 20th Century, but the origins of fundamental human and societal differences are still researched within [[academia]], in fields such as [[human genetics]] including [[paleogenetics]], [[social anthropology]], [[comparative politics]], [[history of religions]], [[history of ideas]], [[prehistory]], [[history]], [[ethics]], and [[psychiatry]]. There is widespread rejection of any methodology based on anything similar to Blumenbach's races. It is more unclear to which extent and when [[ethnic stereotype|ethnic]] and [[nation]]al [[archetype|stereotypes]] are accepted.

Although after [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]], racist ideologies were discredited on ethical, political and scientific grounds, racism and racial discrimination have remained widespread around the world. From time to time when there is a revival of social and political tensions, new works are published which repeat past and discredited racial views such as J R Baker's 'Race'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/27071070 |title=Science, Racism and Social Darwinism – a review of Race by J R Baker |last=Ladimeji|first=O.A. |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the social disapproval of explicit expressions of racism, contemporary authors may achieve a similar effect by insinuating subtle unstated stereotypes in their work as in Gladwell's 'The Tipping Point',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/11720654 |title=Racism and homophobia in Gladwell's Tipping Point|last=Ladimeji |first= O.A.|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a tactic [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] called 'dog whistle racism'.

[[W.E.B. Du Bois|Du Bois]] observed that it is not so much "race" that we think about, but culture: "...&amp;nbsp;a common history, common laws and religion, similar habits of thought and a conscious striving together for certain ideals of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?document=1119 |title=The Conservation of Races |last=DuBois|first=W. E. B. |year=1897 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Late 19th century nationalists were the first to embrace contemporary discourses on "race", ethnicity, and "[[survival of the fittest]]" to shape new nationalist doctrines. Ultimately, race came to represent not only the most important traits of the human body, but was also regarded as decisively shaping the character and personality of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Marius Turda| title = The idea of national superiority in Central Europe, 1880–1918| year = 2004| publisher = Edwin Mellen Press| isbn = 978-0-7734-6180-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, [[culture]] is the physical manifestation created by ethnic groupings, as such fully determined by racial characteristics. Culture and race became considered intertwined and dependent upon each other, sometimes even to the extent of including nationality or language to the set of definition. Pureness of race tended to be related to rather superficial characteristics that were easily addressed and advertised, such as blondness. Racial qualities tended to be related to nationality and language rather than the actual geographic distribution of racial characteristics. In the case of Nordicism, the denomination "Germanic" was equivalent to superiority of race.

Bolstered by some [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] values and achievements of choice, this concept of racial superiority evolved to distinguish from other cultures that were considered inferior or impure. This emphasis on culture corresponds to the modern mainstream definition of racism: "Racism does not originate from the existence of 'races'. It ''creates'' them through a process of social division into categories: anybody can be racialised, independently of their somatic, cultural, religious differences."&lt;ref&gt;National Analytical Study on Racist Violence and Crime, RAXEN Focal Point for ITALY – Annamaria Rivera {{cite web |url=http://fra.europa.eu/fra/material/pub/RAXEN/4/RV/CS-RV-NR-IT.pdf |title=Helping to make fundamental rights a reality for everyone in the European Union |author=FRA |publisher=[[Fundamental Rights Agency|European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights]] |accessdate=22 August 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081216225620/http://fra.europa.eu/fra/material/pub/RAXEN/4/RV/CS-RV-NR-IT.pdf|archivedate=December 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This definition explicitly ignores the biological concept of race, still subject to scientific debate. In the words of [[David C. Rowe]] "A racial concept, although sometimes in the guise of another name, will remain in use in biology and in other fields because scientists, as well as lay persons, are fascinated by human diversity, some of which is captured by race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Joseph L. Graves| title = The Emperor's new clothes: biological theories of race at the millennium| year = 2001| publisher = Rutgers University Press| isbn = 978-0-8135-2847-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial prejudice became subject to international legislation. For instance, the [[Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]], adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on November 20, 1963, address racial prejudice explicitly next to discrimination for reasons of race, colour or ethnic origin (Article I).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070808133610/http://scm.oas.org/doc_public/ENGLISH/HIST_02/CP09414E07.DOC Inter-American Convention against Racism and all forms of Discrimination and Intolerance – Study prepared by the Inter-American Juridical Committee] 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethnicity and ethnic conflicts==
{{Further|Ethnicity}}
Debates over the origins of racism often suffer from a lack of clarity over the term. Many use the term "racism" to refer to more general phenomena, such as [[xenophobia]] and [[ethnocentrism]], although scholars attempt to clearly distinguish those phenomena from racism as an [[ideology]] or from scientific racism, which has little to do with ordinary xenophobia. Others conflate recent forms of racism with earlier forms of ethnic and national conflict. In most cases, ethno-national conflict seems to owe itself to conflict over land and strategic resources. In some cases, [[ethnicity]] and [[nationalism]] were harnessed in order to rally [[combatant]]s in wars between great religious empires (for example, the Muslim Turks and the Catholic Austro-Hungarians).
[[File:Woundedknee1891.jpg|thumb|A mass grave being dug for frozen bodies from the 1890 [[Wounded Knee Massacre]], in which the U.S. Army killed 150 [[Lakota people]], marking the end of the [[American Indian Wars]].]]
Notions of race and racism have often played central roles in [[ethnic conflict]]s. Throughout history, when an adversary is identified as "other" based on notions of race or ethnicity (in particular when "other" is construed to mean "inferior"), the means employed by the self-presumed "superior" party to appropriate territory, human chattel, or material wealth often have been more ruthless, more brutal, and less constrained by [[morality|moral]] or [[ethics|ethical]] considerations. According to historian Daniel Richter, [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] saw the emergence on both sides of the conflict of "the novel idea that all Native people were 'Indians,' that all Euro-Americans were 'Whites,' and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other."&lt;ref&gt;Richter, ''Facing East from Indian Country'', p.&amp;nbsp;208&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basil Davidson]] states in his documentary, ''Africa: Different but Equal'', that racism, in fact, only just recently surfaced—as late as the 19th century, due to the need for a justification for slavery in the Americas.

Historically, racism was a major driving force behind the [[Transatlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref&gt;Fredrickson, George M. 1988. ''The Arrogance of Race: Historical Perspectives on Slavery, Racism, and Social Inequality''. Middletown, Conn: Wesleyan University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also a major force behind [[racial segregation]], especially in the [[United States]] in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and [[South Africa]] under [[apartheid]]; 19th and 20th century racism in the [[Western culture|Western world]] is particularly well documented and constitutes a reference point in studies and discourses about racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Racism : a global reader | first1 = Kevin | last1 = Reilly | first2 = Stephen | last2 = Kaufman | first3 = Angela | last3 = Bodino | year = 2003 | publisher = M.E.

[[Indigenous peoples]] have been –and are– often subject to racist attitudes. Practices and ideologies of racism are condemned by the [[United Nations]] in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly, ''Universal Declaration of Human Rights'', 10 December 1948, 217 A (III), available at: [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/] [accessed 18 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Europe was confronted with the new "[[nationalities]] question," leading to reconfigurations of the European map, on which the frontiers between the states had been delineated during the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. [[Nationalism]] had made its first appearance with the invention of the ''[[levée en masse]]'' by the [[French Revolution]]aries, thus inventing mass [[conscription]] in order to be able to defend the newly founded [[French First Republic|Republic]] against the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' order represented by the European monarchies. This led to the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792–1802) and then to the conquests of [[Napoleon]], and to the subsequent European-wide debates on the concepts and realities of [[nation]]s, and in particular of [[nation-state]]s. The [[Westphalia Treaty]] had divided Europe into various empires and kingdoms ([[Ottoman Empire]], [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Swedish Empire]], [[France|Kingdom of France]], etc.), and for centuries wars were waged between princes (''[[Kabinettskriege]]'' in German).

Modern [[nation-state]]s appeared in the wake of the French Revolution, with the formation of [[patriotism|patriotic]] sentiments for the first time in [[Enlightenment Spain|Spain]] during the [[Peninsula War]] (1808–1813, known in Spain as the Independence War). Despite the restoration of the previous order with the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]], the "nationalities question" became the main problem of Europe during the [[Industrial Era]], leading in particular to the [[1848 Revolutions]], the [[Italian unification]] completed during the 1871 [[Franco-Prussian War]], which itself culminated in the proclamation of the [[German Empire]] in the Hall of Mirrors in the [[Palace of Versailles]], thus achieving the [[German unification]].

Meanwhile, the [[Ottoman Empire]], the "[[sick man of Europe]]", was confronted with endless nationalist movements, which, along with the dissolving of the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]], would lead to the creation after [[World War I]] of the various nation-states of the [[Balkan]]s, with "national [[minorities]]" in their borders.&lt;ref&gt;On this "[[nationalities]] question" and the problem of nationalism, see the relevant articles for a non-exhaustive account of the state of contemporary historical researches; famous works include: [[Ernest Gellner]], ''Nations and Nationalism'' (1983); [[Eric Hobsbawm]],''The Age of Revolution : Europe 1789–1848'' (1962), ''Nations and Nationalism since 1780 : programme, myth, reality'' (1990); [[Benedict Anderson]], ''[[Imagined Communities]]'' (1991); [[Charles Tilly]], ''Coercion, Capital and European States AD 990–1992'' (1990); [[Anthony D. Smith]], ''Theories of Nationalism'' (1971), etc.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ethnic nationalism]], which advocated the belief in a hereditary membership of the nation, made its appearance in the historical context surrounding the creation of the modern nation-states.

One of its main influences was the [[Romantic nationalist]] movement at the turn of the 19th century, represented by figures such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Johann Herder]] (1744–1803), [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Johan Fichte]] (1762–1814) in the ''Addresses to the German Nation'' (1808), [[Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831), or also, in France, [[Jules Michelet]] (1798–1874). It was opposed to [[liberal nationalism]], represented by authors such as [[Ernest Renan]] (1823–1892), who conceived of the nation as a community, which, instead of being based on the ''[[Volk]]'' ethnic group and on a specific, common language, was founded on the subjective will to live together ("the nation is a daily [[plebiscite]]", 1882) or also [[John Stuart Mill]] (1806–1873).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Stuart Mill]], ''Considerations on Representative Government'', 1861&lt;/ref&gt;
Ethnic nationalism blended with scientific racist discourses, as well as with "continental [[imperialist]]" ([[Hannah Arendt]], 1951&lt;ref name="Arendt"&gt;[[Hannah Arendt]], ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' (1951)&lt;/ref&gt;) discourses, for example in the [[pan-Germanism]] discourses, which postulated the racial superiority of the German ''[[Volk]]'' (people/folk). The [[Alldeutscher Verband|Pan-German League]] (''Alldeutscher Verband''), created in 1891, promoted [[German colonial empire|German imperialism]], "[[racial hygiene]]" and was opposed to intermarriage with [[Jews]]. Another popular current, the ''[[Völkisch movement]]'', was also an important proponent of the German ethnic nationalist discourse, and it combined Pan-Germanism with modern [[racial antisemitism]]. Members of the Völkisch movement, in particular the [[Thule Society]], would participate in the founding of the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) in Munich in 1918, the predecessor of the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP; commonly known in English as the Nazi party). Pan-Germanism played a decisive role in the [[interwar period]] of the 1920s–1930s.&lt;ref name=Arendt /&gt;

These currents began to associate the idea of the nation with the biological concept of a "[[master race]]" (often the "[[Aryan race]]" or the "[[Nordic race]]") issued from the scientific racist discourse. They conflated nationalities with ethnic groups, called "races", in a radical distinction from previous racial discourses that posited the existence of a "race struggle" inside the nation and the state itself. Furthermore, they believed that political boundaries should mirror these alleged racial and ethnic groups, thus justifying [[ethnic cleansing]] in order to achieve "racial purity" and also to achieve ethnic homogeneity in the nation-state.

Such racist discourses, combined with nationalism, were not, however, limited to pan-Germanism. In France, the transition from Republican, liberal nationalism, to ethnic nationalism, which made nationalism a characteristic of [[History of far-right movements in France|far-right movements in France]], took place during the [[Dreyfus Affair]] at the end of the 19th century. During several years, a nationwide crisis affected French society, concerning the alleged treason of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a French Jewish military officer. The country polarized itself into two opposite camps, one represented by [[Émile Zola]], who wrote ''[[J'Accuse…!]]'' in defense of Alfred Dreyfus, and the other represented by the nationalist poet, [[Maurice Barrès]] (1862–1923), one of the founders of the ethnic nationalist discourse in France.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Barrès]], ''Le Roman de l'énergie nationale'' (The Novel of National Energy, a trilogy started in 1897)&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Charles Maurras]] (1868–1952), founder of the monarchist ''[[Action française]]'' movement, theorized the "anti-France," composed of the "four confederate states of Protestants, Jews, Freemasons and foreigners" (his actual word for the latter being the pejorative ''[[Metic|métèques]]''). Indeed, to him the first three were all "internal foreigners", who threatened the ethnic unity of the [[French people]].

[[Bernard Lewis]] has cited the [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] who, in his discussion of [[slavery]], stated that while [[Greeks]] are free by nature, '[[barbarian]]s' (non-Greeks) are slaves by nature, in that it is in their nature to be more willing to submit to a [[Despotism|despotic]] government.&lt;ref name=Lewis /&gt; Though Aristotle does not specify any particular races, he argues that people from nations outside Greece are more prone to the burden of slavery than those from [[Ancient Greece|Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Bernard Lewis| authorlink = Bernard Lewis| title = Race and slavery in the Middle East: an historical enquiry| year = 1992| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-505326-5| pages = 54–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Aristotle makes remarks about the most natural slaves being those with strong bodies and slave souls (unfit for rule, unintelligent) which would seem to imply a physical basis for discrimination, he also explicitly states that the right kind of souls and bodies don't always go together, implying that the greatest determinate for inferiority and natural slaves versus natural masters is the soul, not the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/distance_arc/las_casas/Aristotle-slavery.html |title=Aristotle on Slavery |publisher=Oregonstate.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906070456/http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl302/distance_arc/las_casas/Aristotle-slavery.html |archivedate=September 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This proto-racism is seen as an important precursor to modern racism by classicist [[Benjamin Isaac]].

Such proto-racism and ethnocentrism must be looked at within context, because a modern understanding of racism based on hereditary inferiority (modern racism based on: [[eugenics]] and scientific racism) was not yet developed and it is unclear whether Aristotle believed the natural inferiority of Barbarians was caused by environment and climate (like many of his contemporaries) or by birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jfylyRawl8EC&amp;pg=PA175&amp;lpg=PA175&amp;dq=aristotle+racism#v=onepage&amp;q=aristotle%20racism&amp;f=false |title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity |first=Benjamin H. |last=Isaac |authorlink=Benjamin Isaac |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |accessdate=2013-11-14|isbn=978-0-691-12598-5 |year=2006 |page=175 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Dante A. Puzzo, in his discussion of Aristotle, racism, and the ancient world writes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Racism rests on two basic assumptions: that a correlation exists between physical characteristics and moral qualities; that mankind is divisible into superior and inferior stocks. Racism, thus defined, is a modern conception, for prior to the XVIth century there was virtually nothing in the life and thought of the West that can be described as racist. To prevent misunderstanding a clear distinction must be made between racism and [[ethnocentrism]]&amp;nbsp;... The Ancient [[Hebrews]], in referring to all who were not Hebrews as [[Gentile]]s, were indulging in [[ethnocentrism]], not in racism.&amp;nbsp;... So it was with the [[Greeks|Hellenes]] who denominated all non-Hellenes—whether the wild [[Scythians]] or the [[Egyptians]] whom they acknowledged as their mentors in the arts of [[civilization]]—Barbarians, the term denoting that which was strange or foreign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Racism and the Western Tradition |first=Dante A. |last=Puzzo |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=25 |issue=4 |year=1964 |pages=579–586 |doi=10.2307/2708188 |jstor=2708188|bibcode=1961JHI....22..215C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...beyond [known peoples of black West Africa] to the south there is no civilization in the proper sense. There are only humans who are closer to dumb animals than to rational beings. They live in thickets and caves, and eat herbs and unprepared grain. They frequently eat each other. They cannot be considered human beings. Therefore, the Negro nations are, as a rule, submissive to slavery, because (Negroes) have little that is (essentially) human and possess attributes that are quite similar to those of dumb animals, as we have stated.&lt;ref name="Lewis53" /&gt;&lt;ref name="colorq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colorq.org/Articles/article.aspx?d=2002&amp;x=arabviews |title=West Asian views on black Africans during the medieval era |publisher=Colorq.org |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, according to [[Wesleyan University]] professor Abdelmajid Hannoum, such attitudes were not prevalent until the 18th and 19th centuries.

The legacy Catholic [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] then formulated the ''[[Cleanliness of blood]]'' doctrine. It was during this time in history that the Western concept of aristocratic "[[Nobility#"Blue" blood|blue blood]]" emerged in a racialized, religious and feudal context,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pachami.com/Inquisicion/LimpiezaSangre.html|title=Limpieza de Sangre|last=A. Chami|first=Pablo|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; so as to stem the upward social mobility of the converted [[Converso|New Christians]]. Robert Lacey explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was the Spaniards who gave the world the notion that an aristocrat's blood is not red but blue. The Spanish nobility started taking shape around the ninth century in classic military fashion, occupying land as warriors on horseback. They were to continue the process for more than five hundred years, clawing back sections of the peninsula from its Moorish occupiers, and a nobleman demonstrated his pedigree by holding up his sword arm to display the filigree of blue-blooded veins beneath his pale skin—proof that his birth had not been contaminated by the dark-skinned enemy. Sangre azul, blue blood, was thus a euphemism for being a [[white people|white]] man—Spain's own particular reminder that the refined footsteps of the aristocracy through history carry the rather less refined spoor of racism.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Lacey, ''Aristocrats''. Little, Brown and Company, 1983, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the expulsion of the Arabic [[Moors]] and most of the [[Sephardic Jews]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]], the remaining [[Jews]] and [[Muslim]]s were forced to [[Converso|convert]] to Roman Catholicism, becoming "[[New Christian]]s", who were sometimes discriminated against by the "[[Old Christian]]s" in some cities (e.g. [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]), despite condemnations by the Church and the State, which both welcomed the new flock.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[Inquisition]] was carried out by members of the [[Dominican Order]] in order to weed out the converts who still practiced [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] in secret. The system and ideology of the ''limpieza de sangre'' ostracized false Christian converts from society in order to protect it against [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Los estatutos de Limpieza de Sangre|page=121|author=Sicroff, Albert A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remnants of such legislation persevered into the 19th century in military contexts.&lt;ref&gt;''Colección Legislativa de España'' (1870), p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Portugal]], the legal distinction between New and Old Christian was only ended through a legal decree issued by the [[Marquis of Pombal]] in 1772, almost three centuries after the implementation of the racist discrimination. The ''limpieza de sangre'' legislation was common also during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonization of the Americas]], where it led to the racial and feudal separation of peoples and social strata in the colonies. It was however often ignored in practice, as the new colonies needed skilled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Jewish diaspora: origins, experiences, and culture|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2009|isbn=978-1-85109-873-6|page=689|author=Avrum Ehrlich, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the [[Spanish Renaissance|Renaissance]], the [[Valladolid debate]] (1550–1551) concerning the treatment of [[Indigenous people of the Americas|natives]] of the "[[New World]]" opposed the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar and Bishop of Chiapas [[Bartolomé de Las Casas]] to another Dominican and Humanist [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda]]. The latter argued that the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] practiced [[human sacrifice]] of innocents, [[cannibalism]], and other such "crimes against nature" were unacceptable and should be suppressed by any means possible including war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tratado sobre las Justas Causas de la Guerra contra los Indios|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica|year=1941|location=Mexico D.F.|pages=155|author=Ginés de Sepúlveda, Juan (trans.

To the contrary, Bartolomé de Las Casas argued that the Amerindians were free men in the natural order and deserved the same treatment as others, according to [[Catholic theology]]. It was one of the many controversies concerning racism, slavery, religion, and European morality that would arise in the following centuries and which resulted in the legislation protecting the natives.&lt;ref name="Hernandez"&gt;{{cite journal|year= |title=The Las Casas-Sepúlveda Controversy: 1550–1551 |url=http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~epf/journal_archive/volume_X,_2001/hernandez_b.pdf |journal=Ex Post Facto |volume=10 |issue= |pages=95–104 |doi= |pmc= |pmid= |author=Bonar Ludwig Hernandez |date=2001 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421063702/http://userwww.sfsu.edu/epf/journal_archive/volume_X%2C_2001/hernandez_b.pdf |archivedate=21 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage between Luisa de Abrego, a free black domestic servant from Seville and Miguel Rodríguez, a white segovian conquistador in 1565 in St. Augustine (Spanish Florida), is the first known and recorded Christian marriage anywhere in the continental United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://laflorida.org/florida-stories/|title=Luisa de Abrego: Marriage, Bigamy, and the Spanish Inquisition|publisher=http://laflorida.org|author=J.

Although [[antisemitism]] has a long history, related to [[Christianity]] and e.g. [[Ancient Egyptian religion|native Egyptian]] or [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek religions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism|last=Flannery|first=Edward|date=2004-11-02|publisher=Paulist Press|isbn=9780809143245|edition=2nd|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[anti-Judaism]]), racism itself is sometimes described as a ''modern'' phenomenon. In the view of the French philosopher and historian [[Michel Foucault]], the first formulation of racism emerged in the [[Early modern Europe|Early Modern period]] as the "[[discourse]] of race struggle", a historical and political discourse, which Foucault opposed to the philosophical and juridical discourse of [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, ''Society Must Be Defended'' (1976–77)&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, e.g. Chinese self-identification as a "yellow race" predated such European racial concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/10955/Race-Racism-in-Asia-Race-Racism-in-China.html|title=Race and Racism in Asia – Race And Racism in China|last=|first=|date=|website=science.jrank.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-01|quote=Chinese descriptions of themselves as a "yellow" race predated European use of such terms.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This European analysis, which first appeared in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], was then carried on in [[France]] by such people as [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]], [[Nicolas Fréret]], and then, during the 1789 [[French Revolution]], [[Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès|Sieyès]], and afterward [[Augustin Thierry]] and [[Antoine Augustin Cournot|Cournot]]. Boulainvilliers, who created the matrix of such racist discourse in [[France in the Middle Ages|medieval France]], conceived of the "race" as being something closer to the sense of a "nation", that is, in his time, the "race" meant the "people".

He conceived of France as being divided between various nations—the unified [[nation-state]] is an [[anachronism]] here—which themselves formed different "races". Boulainvilliers opposed the [[absolute monarchy]], which tried to bypass the [[aristocracy]] by establishing a direct relationship to the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]]. Thus, he developed the theory that the French aristocrats were the descendants of foreign invaders, whom he called the "[[Franks]]", while according to him, the Third Estate constituted the autochthonous, vanquished [[Gallo-Romans]], who were dominated by the Frankish aristocracy as a consequence of the [[right of conquest]]. Early modern racism was opposed to nationalism and the nation-state: the [[François Dominique de Reynaud de Montlosier|Comte de Montlosier]], in exile during the [[French Revolution]], who borrowed Boulainvilliers' discourse on the "Nordic race" as being the French aristocracy that invaded the plebeian "Gauls", thus showed his contempt for the Third Estate, calling it "this new people born of slaves&amp;nbsp;... [[miscegenation|mixture of all races and of all times]]".

While 19th-century racism became closely intertwined with nationalism,&lt;ref&gt;Academic Press (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=pvHRNNk9hHEC&amp;pg=PA435&amp;dq=racism+and+ethnic+nationalism+in+the+19th+century,&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B8DTUt2WK8qShQeKuICYDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=racism%20and%20ethnic%20nationalism%20in%20the%2019th%20century%2C&amp;f=false/ " Encyclopedia of Nationalism, Two-Volume Set, Volume 2"].&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the [[ethnic nationalist]] discourse that identified the "race" with the "[[Volk (German word)|folk]]", leading to such movements as [[pan-Germanism]], [[pan-Turkism]], [[pan-Arabism]], and [[pan-Slavism]], medieval racism precisely divided the nation into various non-biological "races", which were thought to be the consequence of historical conquests and [[social conflict]]s. Michel Foucault traced the genealogy of modern racism to this medieval "historical and political discourse of race struggle". According to him, it divided itself in the 19th century according to two rival lines: on one hand, it was incorporated by racists, biologists and [[eugenicists]], who gave it the modern sense of "race" and, even more, transformed this popular discourse into a "[[state racism]]" (e.g., Nazism). On the other hand, [[Marxists|Marxism]] also seized this discourse founded on the assumption of a political struggle that provided the real [[philosophy of history|engine of history]] and continued to act underneath the apparent peace. Thus, Marxists transformed the [[essentialist]] notion of "race" into the historical notion of "[[class struggle]]", defined by socially structured positions: capitalist or proletarian. In ''[[The Will to Knowledge]]'' (1976), Foucault analyzed another opponent of the "race struggle" discourse: [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[psychoanalysis]], which opposed the concept of "blood [[heredity]]", prevalent in the 19th century racist discourse.

Authors such as [[Hannah Arendt]], in her 1951 book ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', have said that the racist ideology (''popular racism'') which developed at the end of the 19th century helped legitimize the [[New Imperialism|imperialist conquests]] of foreign territories and the atrocities that sometimes accompanied them (such as the [[Herero and Namaqua Genocide]] of 1904–1907 or the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915–1917). [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem ''[[The White Man's Burden]]'' (1899) is one of the more famous illustrations of the belief in the inherent superiority of the [[Western culture|European culture]] over the rest of the world, though it is also thought to be a satirical appraisal of such imperialism. Racist ideology thus helped legitimize the conquest and incorporation of foreign territories into an empire, which were regarded as a humanitarian obligation partially as a result of these racist beliefs.

However, during the 19th century, Western European colonial powers were involved in the suppression of the [[Arab slave trade]] in Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server?show=nav.5938&amp;outputFormat=print |title=Royal Navy and the Slave Trade : Battles : History |publisher=Royal-navy.mod.uk |accessdate=2010-05-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510210721/http://www.royal-navy.mod.uk/server?show=nav.5938&amp;outputFormat=print |archivedate=May 10, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the suppression of the [[slave trade]] in [[West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |title=Chasing Freedom Exhibition: the Royal Navy and the Suppression of the Transatlantic Slave Trade |publisher=Royalnavalmuseum.org |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate=2010-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210021701/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |archivedate=December 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Europeans during the time period objected to injustices that occurred in some colonies and lobbied on behalf of [[aboriginal peoples]]. Thus, when the [[Saartjie Baartman|Hottentot Venus]] was displayed in England in the beginning of the 19th century, the African Association publicly opposed itself to the exhibition. The same year that Kipling published his poem, [[Joseph Conrad]] published ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), a clear criticism of the [[Congo Free State]] owned by [[Leopold II of Belgium]].

Examples of racial theories used include the creation of the [[Hamitic]] [[ethno-linguistic]] group during the [[European exploration of Africa]]. It was then restricted by [[Karl Friedrich Lepsius]] (1810–1877) to non-[[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Afro-Asiatic languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Merriam Webster (editor), ''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', 10 Rev Ed edition, (Merriam-Webster: 1998), p. 563&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Hamite'' was applied to different populations within North Africa, mainly comprising [[Ethiopia]]ns, [[Demographics of Eritrea|Eritreans]], [[Somali people|Somalis]], [[Berber people|Berbers]], and the [[Egyptians|ancient Egyptians]]. Hamites were regarded as Caucasoid peoples who probably originated in either [[Arabia]] or [[Middle East|Asia]] on the basis of their cultural, physical and linguistic similarities with the peoples of those areas.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald James Harrison, ''Africa and the Islands'', (Wiley: 1965), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Dodge, ''African Politics in Perspective'', (Van Nostrand: 1966), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Senior, ''Tropical Lands: a human geography'', (Longman: 1979), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Europeans considered Hamites to be more civilized than [[Black people|Sub-Saharan Africans]], and more akin to themselves and [[Semitic peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;A. H. M. Jones, Elizabeth Monroe, ''History of Abyssinia'', (Kessinger Publishing: 2003), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two-thirds of the 20th century, the Hamitic race was, in fact, considered one of the branches of the [[Caucasian race]], along with the [[Aryan race|Indo-Europeans]], [[Semitic people|Semites]], and the [[Mediterranean race]].

However, the Hamitic peoples themselves were often deemed to have failed as rulers, which was usually ascribed to [[miscegenation|interbreeding]] with Negroes. In the mid-20th century, the German scholar [[Carl Meinhof]] (1857–1944) claimed that the [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] race was formed by a merger of [[Hamitic]] and [[Negroid|Negro]] races. The Hottentots ([[Nama people|Nama]] or [[Khoi]]) were formed by the merger of Hamitic and [[Bushmen]] (San) races—both being termed nowadays as [[Khoisan]] peoples.

''The Slumbering Volcano: American Slave Ship Revolts and the Production of Rebellious Masculinity''. p. 264. Duke University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Racism spread throughout the New World in the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Whitecapping]], which started in Indiana in the late 19th century, soon spread throughout all of North America, causing many African laborers to flee from the land they worked on. In the US during the 1860s, racist posters were used during election campaigns. In one of these racist posters (see above), a black man is depicted lounging idly in the foreground as one white man ploughs his field and another chops wood. Accompanying labels are: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread," and "The white man must work to keep his children and pay his taxes." The black man wonders, "Whar is de use for me to work as long as dey make dese appropriations." Above in a cloud is an image of the "Freedman's Bureau! Negro Estimate of Freedom!" The bureau is pictured as a large domed building resembling the U.S. Capitol and is inscribed "Freedom and No Work." Its columns and walls are labeled, "Candy," "Rum, Gin, Whiskey," "Sugar Plums," "Indolence," "White Women," "Apathy," "White Sugar," "Idleness," and so on.

On June 5, 1873, Sir [[Francis Galton]], distinguished English explorer and cousin of Charles Darwin, wrote in a letter to ''[[The Times]]'':

{{bq|1=My proposal is to make the encouragement of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] settlements of [[Africa]] a part of our national policy, in the belief that the Chinese immigrants would not only maintain their position, but that they would multiply and their descendants supplant the inferior Negro race&amp;nbsp;...

The racial ideology conceived by the Nazis graded humans on a scale of pure Aryan to non-Aryan, with the latter viewed as subhuman. At the top of the scale of pure Aryans were Germans and other Germanic peoples including the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Scandinavia]]ns, and the [[English people|English]] as well as other peoples such as some northern Italians and the French who were said to have a suitable admixture of Germanic blood.&lt;ref name="Davies06"&gt;Davies, Norman (2006).

The modern biological definition of race developed in the 19th century with scientific racist theories. The term ''scientific racism'' refers to the use of science to justify and support racist beliefs, which goes back to the early 18th century, though it gained most of its influence in the mid-19th century, during the [[New Imperialism]] period. Also known as academic racism, such theories first needed to overcome the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]]'s resistance to [[positivism|positivist]] accounts of history and its support of [[monogenism]], the concept that all human beings were originated from the same ancestors, in accordance with [[creationist]] accounts of history.

These racist theories put forth on scientific hypothesis were combined with [[unilineal evolution|unilineal theories of social progress]], which postulated the superiority of the European civilization over the rest of the world. Furthermore, they frequently made use of the idea of "[[survival of the fittest]]", a term coined by [[Herbert Spencer]] in 1864, associated with ideas of competition, which were named [[social Darwinism]] in the 1940s. [[Charles Darwin]] himself opposed the idea of rigid racial differences in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871) in which he argued that humans were all of one species, sharing common descent. He recognised racial differences as varieties of humanity, and emphasised the close similarities between people of all races in mental faculties, tastes, dispositions and habits, while still contrasting the culture of the "lowest savages" with European civilization.&lt;ref name="dom"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=245 |title=The descent of man, and selection in relation to sex |accessdate=2007-12-02 |author=Charles Darwin |authorlink=Charles Darwin|year=1871 |publisher=John Murray|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014528/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F937.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=245 |archivedate = September 30, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Desmond| first = Adrian| author2 = James Richard Moore| title = Darwin| year = 1991| publisher = Michael Joseph, Penguin Group| isbn = 978-0-7181-3430-3| oclc = 185764721 }} pp. 28, 147, 580.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 19th century, proponents of scientific racism intertwined themselves with [[eugenics]] discourses of "[[degeneration]] of the race" and "blood [[heredity]]."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Henceforth, scientific racist discourses could be defined as the combination of polygenism, unilinealism, social Darwinism and eugenism. They found their scientific legitimacy on [[physical anthropology]], [[anthropometry]], [[craniometry]], [[phrenology]], [[physiognomy]], and others now discredited disciplines in order to formulate racist prejudices.

Before being disqualified in the 20th century by the American school of [[cultural anthropology]] ([[Franz Boas]], etc.), the British school of [[social anthropology]] ([[Bronisław Malinowski]], [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], etc.), the French school of [[ethnology]] ([[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], etc.), as well as the discovery of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|neo-Darwinian synthesis]], such sciences, in particular anthropometry, were used to deduce behaviours and psychological characteristics from outward, physical appearances.

The neo-Darwinian synthesis, first developed in the 1930s, eventually led to a [[gene-centered view of evolution]] in the 1960s. According to the [[Human Genome Project]], the most complete mapping of human DNA to date indicates that there is no clear [[Race and genetics|genetic basis to racial groups]]. While some genes are more common in certain populations, there are no genes that exist in all members of one population and no members of any other.&lt;ref name="ornl"&gt;{{cite web | title = Minorities, Race, and Genomics| url = http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/minorities.shtml | accessdate = 2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heredity and eugenics===
{{Further|Eugenics}}
The first theory of [[eugenics]] was developed in 1869 by [[Francis Galton]] (1822–1911), who used the then popular concept of ''[[degeneration]]''. He applied [[statistics]] to study human differences and the alleged "[[inheritance of intelligence]]", foreshadowing future uses of "[[intelligence testing]]" by the anthropometry school. Such theories were vividly described by the writer [[Émile Zola]] (1840–1902), who started publishing in 1871 a twenty-novel cycle, ''[[Les Rougon-Macquart]]'', where he linked [[heredity]] to behavior. Thus, Zola described the high-born Rougons as those involved in politics (''[[Son Excellence Eugène Rougon]]'') and medicine (''[[Le Docteur Pascal]]'') and the low-born Macquarts as those fatally falling into [[alcoholism]] (''[[L'Assommoir]]''), [[prostitution]] (''[[Nana (novel)|Nana]]''), and [[homicide]] (''[[La Bête humaine]]'').

During the rise of [[Nazi Germany|Nazism in Germany]], some scientists in Western nations worked to debunk the regime's racial theories. A few argued against racist ideologies and discrimination, even if they believed in the alleged existence of biological races. However, in the fields of anthropology and biology, these were minority positions until the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[UNESCO]], ''[[The Race Question]]'', 1950&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 1950 UNESCO statement, ''[[The Race Question]]'', an international project to debunk racist theories had been attempted in the mid-1930s. However, this project had been abandoned. Thus, in 1950, UNESCO declared that it had resumed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...up again, after a lapse of fifteen years, a project that the [[International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation]] has wished to carry through but that it had to abandon in deference to the [[Appeasement of Hitler|appeasement policy]] of the pre-war period. The race question had become one of the pivots of [[Nazi ideology]] and policy. [[Tomáš Masaryk|Masaryk]] and [[Edvard Beneš|Beneš]] took the initiative of calling for a conference to re-establish in the minds and consciences of men everywhere the truth about race&amp;nbsp;... Nazi propaganda was able to continue its baleful work unopposed by the authority of an international organisation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Third Reich's racial policies]], its [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics programs]] and the extermination of Jews in [[the Holocaust]], as well as [[Romani people]] in the [[Porrajmos]] (the [[Porajmos|Romani Holocaust]]) and others minorities led to a change in opinions about scientific research into race after the war.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Changes within scientific disciplines, such as the rise of the [[Franz Boas|Boasian]] school of anthropology in the United States contributed to this shift. These theories were strongly denounced in the 1950 UNESCO statement, signed by internationally renowned scholars, and titled ''[[The Race Question]]''.

===Polygenism and racial typologies===
{{Further|Polygenism |Typology (anthropology)}}
[[File:Passing of the Great Race - Map 4.jpg|right|thumb|Madison Grant's map, from 1916, charting the "present distribution of European races", with the [[Nordic race|Nordics]] in red, the [[Alpine race|Alpines]] in green, and the [[Mediterranean race|Mediterraneans]] in yellow.]]
Works such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–1855) may be considered as one of the first theorizations of this new racism, founded on an essentialist notion of race, which opposed the former racial discourse, of [[Henri de Boulainvilliers|Boulainvilliers]] for example, which saw in races a fundamentally historical reality, which changed over time. Gobineau, thus, attempted to frame racism within the terms of biological differences among humans, giving it the legitimacy of [[biology]].

Gobineau's theories would be expanded, in France, by [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854–1936)'s [[typology (anthropology)|typology of races]], who published in 1899 ''The Aryan and his Social Role'', in which he claimed that the white, "[[Aryan]] race", "[[Cephalic index|dolichocephalic]]", was opposed to the "brachycephalic" race, of whom the "[[Jew]]" was the archetype. Vacher de Lapouge thus created a hierarchical classification of races, in which he identified the "''[[Nordic race|Homo europaeus]]'' (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the "''[[Homo alpinus]]''" ([[Auvergne (province)|Auvergnat]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], etc.), and finally the "''[[Homo mediterraneus]]''" ([[Naples|Neapolitan]], [[Andalusia|Andalus]], etc.) He assimilated races and [[social class]]es, considering that the French upper class was a representation of the ''Homo europaeus'', while the lower class represented the ''Homo alpinus''. Applying Galton's eugenics to his theory of races, Vacher de Lapouge's "selectionism" aimed first at achieving the annihilation of [[trade union]]ists, considered to be a "degenerate"; second, creating types of man each destined to one end, in order to prevent any contestation of [[labour condition]]s. His "anthroposociology" thus aimed at blocking [[social conflict]] by establishing a fixed, hierarchical social order.&lt;ref&gt;Matsuo Takeshi ([[Shimane Prefecture|University of Shimane]], Japan). ''L'Anthropologie de Georges Vacher de Lapouge: Race, classe et eugénisme'' (Georges Vacher de Lapouge anthropology) in ''[[Études de langue et littérature françaises]]'' 2001, n°79, pp. 47–57. {{ISSN|0425-4929}}; [[INIST]]-[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]], Cote INIST : 25320, 35400010021625.0050 ([http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=13473405 Abstract resume on the INIST-CNRS])&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, [[William Z. Ripley]] used identical racial classification in ''[[The Races of Europe (Ripley)|The Races of Europe]]'' (1899), which would have a great influence in the United States. Other scientific authors include [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain|H.S. Chamberlain]] at the end of the 19th century (a British citizen who [[naturalization|naturalized]] himself as German because of his admiration for the "Aryan race") and [[Madison Grant]], a eugenicist and author of ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916). Madison Grant provided statistics for the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], which severely restricted immigration of Jews, [[Slavs]], and southern Europeans, who were subsequently hindered in seeking to escape Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The funding of scientific racism: Wickliffe Draper and the Pioneer Fund |last=Tucker |first=William H. |authorlink=William H.

===Human zoos===
[[File:Humanzoogermany.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[human zoo]] (''Völkerschau'', "People Show") in [[Stuttgart]], Germany in 1928]] [[Human zoo]]s (called "People Shows"), were an important means of bolstering ''popular racism'' by connecting it to scientific racism: they were both objects of public curiosity and of [[anthropology]] and [[anthropometry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/979954/ On A Neglected Aspect Of Western Racism], Kurt Jonassohn, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Human zoos – Racist theme parks for Europe's colonialists |work=[[Le Monde diplomatique]] |date = August 2000|url=http://mondediplo.com/2000/08/07humanzoo |author1=Pascal Blanchard, Sandrine Lemaire  |author2=Nicolas Bancel |lastauthoramp=yes }} ; {{cite news |title=Ces zoos humains de la République coloniale |work=[[Le Monde diplomatique]]  |date=August 2000|url=http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2000/08/BANCEL/14145.html|language=fr}} (available to everyone)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joice Heth]], an African American slave, was displayed by [[Phineas Taylor Barnum|P.T.

==Theories about the origins of racism==
{{See also|Ethnocentrism|Tribalism}}
[[File:Model of ethnic &amp; ratial conflict.png|thumb|Sociological model of ethnic and racial conflict.]]
Evolutionary psychologists [[John Tooby]] and [[Leda Cosmides]] were puzzled by the fact that in the US race is one of the three characteristics most often used in brief descriptions of individuals (the others are age and sex). They reasoned that [[natural selection]] would not have favoured the evolution of an instinct for using race as a classification, because for most of human history, humans almost never encountered members of other races. Tooby and Cosmides hypothesized that modern people use race as a proxy (rough-and-ready indicator) for coalition membership, since a better-than-random guess about "which side" another person is on will be helpful if one does not actually know in advance.

Their colleague [[Robert Kurzban]] designed an experiment whose results appeared to support this hypothesis. Using the [[Memory confusion protocol]], they presented subjects with pictures of individuals and sentences, allegedly spoken by these individuals, which presented two sides of a debate. The errors that the subjects made in recalling who said what indicated that they sometimes misattributed a statement to a speaker of the same race as the "correct" speaker, although they also sometimes misattributed a statement to a speaker "on the same side" as the "correct" speaker. In a second run of the experiment, the team also distinguished the "sides" in the debate by clothing of similar colors; and in this case the effect of racial similarity in causing mistakes almost vanished, being replaced by the color of their clothing. In other words, the first group of subjects, with no clues from clothing, used race as a visual guide to guessing who was on which side of the debate; the second group of subjects used the clothing color as their main visual clue, and the effect of race became very small.&lt;ref name="KurzbanToobyCosmides2001ErasingRace"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Can race be erased?

Some research suggests that ethnocentric thinking may have actually contributed to the development of cooperation. Political scientists Ross Hammond and Robert Axelrod created a computer simulation wherein virtual individuals were randomly assigned one of a variety of skin colors, and then one of a variety of trading strategies: be color-blind, favor those of your own color, or favor those of other colors. They found that the ethnocentric individuals clustered together, then grew until all the non-ethnocentric individuals were wiped out.&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist. Issue 2595, 17 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] writes that "Blood-feuds and inter-clan warfare are easily interpretable in terms of [[W. D. Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s [[kin selection|genetic theory]]." Dawkins writes that racial prejudice, while not evolutionarily adaptive, "could be interpreted as an irrational generalization of a kin-selected tendency to identify with individuals physically resembling oneself, and to be nasty to individuals different in appearance".&lt;ref name="Dawkins2006"&gt;{{cite book| author = Richard Dawkins| title = The selfish gene| url = https://books.google.com/?id=EJeHTt8hW7UC&amp;pg=PA99| year = 2006| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-929115-1| page = 99 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simulation-based experiments in [[evolutionary game theory]] have attempted to provide an explanation for the selection of ethnocentric-strategy phenotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0022002706293470| pmc = | pmid =  | last1 = Hammond | first1 = R.

Despite support for evolutionary theories relating to an innate origin of racism, various studies have suggested racism is associated with lower intelligence and less diverse peer groups during childhood. A neuroimaging study on amygdala activity during racial matching activities found increased activity to be associated with adolescent age as well as less racially diverse peer groups which the author conclude suggest a learned aspect of racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Telzer|first1=Eva|last2=Humphreys|first2=Kathryn|last3=Mor|first3=Shapiro|last4=Tottenham|first4=Nim|title=Amygdala Sensitivity to Race Is Not Present in Childhood but Emerges over Adolescence|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=25|issue=2|pages=234–44|doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00311|pmid=23066731|year=2013|pmc=3628780}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta analysis of neuroimaging studies found amygdala activity correlated to increased scores on implicit measures of racial bias.

[[State racism]]—that is, the institutions and practices of a nation-state that are grounded in racist ideology—has played a major role in all instances of [[settler colonialism]], from the [[United States]] to [[Australia]]. It also played a prominent role in the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] regime, in [[Fascism|fascist]] regimes throughout [[Europe]], and during the early years of Japan's [[Shōwa period]]. These governments advocated and implemented ideologies and policies that were racist, xenophobic and, in the case of [[Nazism]], genocidal.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Russel of Liverpool, ''The Knights of Bushido'', 2002, p. 238, [[Herbert Bix]], ''[[Hirohito and the making of modern Japan]]'', 2001, pp. 313–14, 326, 359–60; [[Karel van Wolferen]], ''[[The Enigma of Japanese power]]'', 1989, pp.&amp;nbsp;263–72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paulino|first1=Edward|title=Anti-Haitianism, Historical Memory, and the Potential for Genocidal Violence in the Dominican Republic|journal=Genocide Studies International|date=December 2006|volume=1|issue=3|pages=265-288|doi=10.3138/7864-3362-3R24-6231|issn=2291-1847|eissn=2291-1855}}&lt;/ref&gt; The politics of Zimbabwe promote discrimination against whites, in an effort to ethnically cleanse the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/africa/03/30/zimbabwe.farmers/index.html |title=Tale of two farms in Zimbabwe – March 30, 2005 |publisher=CNN |date=2005-03-30 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] of 1935 prohibited sexual relations between any Aryan and Jew, considering it ''[[Rassenschande]]'', "racial pollution". The Nuremberg Laws stripped all Jews, even quarter- and half-Jews (second and first degree ''Mischlings''), of their German citizenship. This meant that they had no basic citizens' rights, e.g., [[the right to vote]]. In 1936, Jews were banned from all professional jobs, effectively preventing them from having any influence in education, politics, higher education and industry. On 15 November 1938, Jewish children were banned from going to normal schools. By April 1939, nearly all Jewish companies had either collapsed under financial pressure and declining profits, or had been persuaded to sell out to the Nazi government. This further reduced their rights as human beings; they were in many ways officially separated from the German populace. Similar laws existed in [[Bulgaria]] – [[Law for protection of the nation|The Law for protection of the nation]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], and [[Austria]].

Legislative state racism is known to have been enforced by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] of [[South Africa]] during its [[Apartheid]] regime between 1948 and 1994. Here a series of [[Apartheid legislation in South Africa|Apartheid legislation]] was passed through the legal systems to make it legal for white South Africans to have rights which were superior to those of non-white South Africans. Non-white South Africans were not allowed involvement in any governing matters, including voting; access to quality healthcare; the provision of basic services, including clean water; electricity; as well as access to adequate schooling. Non-white South Africans were also prevented from accessing certain public areas, from using certain public transportation and were required to live only in certain designated areas. Non-white South Africans were taxed differently than white South Africans and they were also required to carry on them at all times additional documentation, which later became known as "dom passes", to certify their non-white South African citizenship. All of these legislative racial laws were abolished through a series of equal [[human rights]] laws which were passed at the end of the [[Apartheid]] era in the early 1990s.

==Anti-racism==
{{Main|Anti-racism}}
[[File:Anti-racist-rally-Sydney-2005-Dec-18-small.jpeg|thumb|An anti-racism rally held outside [[Sydney Town Hall]], December 2005.]]
Anti-racism includes beliefs, actions, movements, and policies which are adopted or developed in order to oppose racism. In general, it promotes an egalitarian society in which people are not discriminated against on the basis of race. Movements such as the [[civil rights movement]] and the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] were examples of anti-racist movements. [[Nonviolent resistance]] is sometimes embraced as an element of anti-racist movements, although this was not always the case. [[Hate crime]] laws, [[affirmative action]], and bans on racist speech are also examples of government policy which is intended to suppress racism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="74965">A '''referendum''' (in some countries synonymous with '''plebiscite''', or a vote on a '''ballot question''') is a direct [[vote]] in which an entire [[Constituency|electorate]] is asked to either accept or reject a particular proposal. This article summarises referendum legislature and practice in various countries.

==Africa==

===Egypt===
{{Main article|Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2011}}
On 19 March 2011 a constitutional referendum was held in [[Egypt]], following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]]. The reforms made it easier for candidates to run for president, limited the number of presidential terms to two four-year periods, and ensured judicial monitoring of elections.

===Eritrea===
In April 1993 nearly 1 million voters in [[Eritrea]] (a quarter of the population), cast ballots to become "sovereign and independent" of Ethiopia. This vote was the result of thirty years of war by Eritreans during their [[Eritrean War of Independence|War of Independence]]. The result was a vote for independence by 99.8% of the voters.

===Morocco===
There have been several referendums in Morocco, most of which were related to the Moroccan constitution. Since becoming King, [[Mohammed VI]] has led many reforms that made Morocco an exception from all the other Arab countries.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} On February 20, 2011, thousands took to the streets of [[Rabat]], [[Casablanca]], [[Tangier]] and [[Marrakesh]] in peaceful protests demanding a new constitution, a change in government and an end to corruption. During a march on Hassan II Avenue in Rabat, demonstrators demanded a new constitution to bring more democracy to the country. They shouted slogans calling for economic opportunity, education reform, better health services, and help in coping with the rising cost of living.

On March 9, King Mohammed VI made a speech that was described as a "historical" speech in which he announced several reforms including a new constitution to the country.

In a televised speech on Friday, 17 June, King Mohammed VI announced a series of constitutional reforms, to be put to a national referendum on 1 July. The proposed reforms would give the prime minister and the parliament more executive authority, and would make Berber an official language in Morocco, together with Arabic. The proposal would empower the prime minister with the authority to appoint government officials and to dissolve the parliament - the powers previously held by the king. However, the king would remain the military commander-in-chief and would retain his position as the chair of the Council of Ministers and the Supreme Security Council, the primary bodies responsible for the security policy. A new constitutional provision would also confirm the king's role as the highest religious authority in the country.

Although most people were celebrating among the protesters after the King's speech, the leaders of the 20 February Movement rejected the proposals as insufficient and called for continuing protests on 19 June 2011. On 29 June 2011, the protesters called for a boycott of the referendum. The referendum was held on June 1, and almost all Moroccans said yes to it with a "98% yes" "2% No" turnout.

==Asia==

=== Bangladesh ===

A constitutional referendum was held in Bangladesh on 15 September 1991. Voters were asked "Should or not the President assent to the Constitution (Twelfth Amendment) Bill, 1991 of the People's Republic of Bangladesh?" The amendments would lead to the reintroduction of parliamentary government, with the President becoming the constitutional head of state, but the Prime Minister the executive head. It also abolished the position of Vice-President and would see the President elected by Parliament. The result saw 83.6% vote in favour, with a turnout of 35.2%.[1]

===East Timor===
[[East Timor]], formerly [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|governed]] by [[Indonesia]], held a [[East Timorese independence referendum, 1999|referendum]] on 30 August 1999, in which voters chose either to become a Special Autonomous Region within Indonesia, or for independence. Around 79% of voters opted for independence.

===Hong Kong===
{{main article|Five Constituencies Referendum}}
Due to discontent towards the proposal of political reform made by the Hong Kong government, the [[Civic Party]] and the [[League of Social Democrats]] joined together to carry out "Five Constituencies Referendum" in early 2010, by having one Legislative Councillors (from either one of the parties) in each constituency resigned, forcing the government to carry out a by-election, thus giving a chance for all voters to show their will towards universal suffrage and the abolition of functional constituencies. This is often called a "''de facto'' referendum".

The [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]] does not provide for official referendums, but the pan-democrats hope that by returning the resignees to the Legislative Council, on their manifesto of [[Democratic development in Hong Kong#Universal suffrage|real political reform in Hong Kong]] and the abolition of [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]],&lt;ref name="scmprba"&gt;Fung, Fanny (19 January 2010), "Referendum bid is against Basic Law, minister says", ''South China Morning Post'', Retrieved on 20 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the election can be seen as a de facto referendum and an endorsement of these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Leong, Alan (8 February 2010) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703630404575052710504046960 "Quantifying Hong Kong's Democratic Desires"] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' Retrieved on 21 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original five pan-democrat Legislative Councillors were re-elected, the turnout was much lower than the expectation of the two parties, due to the suppression of pro-Beijing Camp.

===Indonesia===
[[Indonesian Constitution]] does not mention referendums at all, and as such, referendums are not a part of Indonesian political practice. In 1985, the [[People's Consultative Assembly]] issued Law no. 5/1985&lt;ref&gt;[http://hukum.unsrat.ac.id/uu/uu_5_1985.htm UU No. 5 Tahun 1985], retrieved 21 March 2016 (in Indonesian)&lt;/ref&gt; that officially recognized referendum as a legitimate political process in Indonesia, but revoked in 1999 by Law no. 6/1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpr.go.id/dokjdih/document/uu/UU_1999_6.pdf UU No. 6 Tahun 1999], retrieved 21 March 2016 (in Indonesian)&lt;/ref&gt; According to explanation given in Law no. 6/1999, referendum is not compatible with Indonesian doctrine of [[representative democracy]], as on the fourth principles of the national ideology [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]], absence on mentions of referendums inside the national constitution also became another reason why was the referendum law revoked.

Indonesia had no nationwide referendum, but only regional one and concerning only on territorial changes. In 1969, [[Act of Free Choice]] integrated [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] into Indonesia, despite the name reflecting a referendum, the process actually only involving around 1000 representatives in a process of [[deliberation]]. [[East Timorese independence referendum, 1999|Independence referendum]] in [[Timor Timur|East Timor]] province took place in 1999, paving the way of East Timor province independence from Indonesia in 2002.

===Iran===
In 1979 and after the [[Islamic Revolution]] had toppled the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Iranian monarchy]], a [[Iranian Islamic Republic referendum, March 1979|referendum]] was held to choose the future governing system of the country. The question was a simple yes or no to the [[Islamic Republic]], a system which combines direct representation with religious authority. The [[Islamic Republic]] was established after more than 98% of the population voted yes.

===Iraq===
{{Main article|Constitution of Iraq|Kirkuk status referendum}}
The current [[Constitution of Iraq]] was approved by referendum on 15 October 2005, two years after the [[United States]]-led invasion. The constitution was designed to shift crucial decisions about government, the judiciary and human rights to a future national assembly. It was later modified to provide for the establishment of a committee by the parliament to be elected in December 2005 to consider changes to the constitution in 2006.

===Malaysia===
The [[Malaysian Constitution]] does not mention referendums at all. There have been no referendums in Malaysian history.

===Pakistan===
General Pervez Musharraf held a referendum in [[Pakistan]] on 30 April 2002 to legitimize his presidency and assure its continuance after the approaching restoration of democracy. He thus extended his term to five years after the October 2002 elections. The voter turnout was 80 percent by most estimates, amidst claims of irregularities. A few weeks later, Musharraf went on TV and apologized to the nation for "irregularities" in the referendum.

=== Philippines ===
The [[Constitution of the Philippines]] can only be amended or revised via a national plebiscite. Alteration of boundaries of autonomous regions, provinces, towns, cities and barangays (villages), including creation, merger and upgrading of new local government units from existing ones, are to be decided on local plebiscites amongst the affected places. A referendum is the final step in the approval of a [[People's Initiative|people's initiative]]. All referendums are binding.

The present constitution was approved via [[Philippine constitutional plebiscite, 1987|a plebiscite in 1987]]. The last provincial-level plebiscite was for the creation of the province of [[Davao Occidental]] in 2013 that was approved.

===Singapore===
According to the [[Constitution of Singapore]], a referendum can be held in a few circumstances, including situations when a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament is rejected by the President, or when the nation's sovereignty needs to be decided (''i.e.'', merger or incorporation into other countries).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} {{cnspan|text=There has been only one referendum in Singapore|date=June 2016}} to date, the [[Singapore national referendum, 1962|1962 national referendum]] which decided the terms of a merger of Singapore into Malaysia. There were three choices: 1) To merge with Malaya, having [[autonomy]] in labour and education; 2) To merge with Malaya, having same status as the other states in Malaya; 3) To merge with Malaya, having terms similar to those of the [[Borneo]] territories. Option #1 won with 71% of the vote. [[Singapore in Malaysia|Two years after the merger]], Singapore's [[Singapore in Malaysia#Expulsion|expulsion from Malaysia occurred on 9 August 1965]] due to disagreements between the two political ideas.

===Taiwan===
{{Main article|Referendums in Taiwan}}
The ''Referendum Act'' was promoted and introduced by the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] for years and then enacted by the [[Legislative Yuan]] in 2003. There have been six national referendums and two local referendums in [[Taiwan]].

===Thailand===
On 4 September 2008, amidst hundreds of thousands of protesters demanding the government resign, [[Thailand]]'s premier [[Samak Sundaravej]]'s government approved the idea of a referendum to ask the Thai electorate if it wanted to keep the government or not.

==Europe ==

===Austria===
{{Main article|Elections_in_Austria#Referendums}}

The [[Constitution of Austria|Austrian constitution]] defines two types of referendums on the federal level: binding referendum and non-binding referendum. Binding referendum is mandatory if the [[President of Austria|President]] should be removed from office before the end of his term, and in case of comprehensive change of the [[Constitution of Austria|Federal Constitution]]. Binding referendum is facultative (not mandatory) in case of non-comprehensive changes in the Federal Constitution. 
There was only one binding referendum in post-1945 Austria: [[Austrian conscription referendum, 2013|European Union membership referendum]].

The [[National Council (Austria)|National Council]] has the power to call on a non-binding referendum on matters of great importance. There were two such referendums in post-1945 Austria: [[Austrian nuclear power referendum, 1978|nuclear power referendum]] in 1978, and [[Austrian conscription referendum, 2013|conscription referendum]] in 2013.

===Belgium===
{{Main article|Elections_in_Belgium#Referendums}}

Binding [[referendum]]s in Belgium are not legally possible because of the constitutional principle that the country's powers are exercised by the nation and not by the people. Consequently, Belgium is a [[representative democracy]], almost without any form of [[direct democracy]].

Non-binding referendums on the municipal and provincial level are allowed. Non-binding referendums on the regional level are also allowed by law but the implementation decisions are lacking.  This way government makes it impossible to make use of it.

===Bulgaria===
{{Main article|Elections_in_Bulgaria#Referendums}}
Five nationwide referendums have been held in Bulgaria since it gained its De Facto independence in 1878:
* On [[Bulgarian war criminal prosecution referendum, 1922|19 November 1922]] the question was if criminals from the three previous wars were to be prosecuted;&lt;ref name=DD&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=bg011922 |title=Bulgarien, 19.

* On [[Bulgarian republic referendum, 1946|8 September 1946]] the question was if Bulgaria was to remain a monarchy or to become a republic;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] &amp; Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p368 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On [[Bulgarian constitutional referendum, 1971|16 May 1971]] the nation's approval of a new constitution was asked;&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p368&lt;/ref&gt;
* On [[Bulgarian nuclear power referendum, 2013|27 January 2013]] the question was if Bulgaria should develop its nuclear power by building a new nuclear power plant.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21202176 |title=Q&amp;A: Bulgaria's nuclear energy referendum |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/bulgarians-vote-in-referendum-on-nuclear-energy/a-16553209?maca=en-rss-en-all-1573-rdf |title=Bulgarians vote in referendum on nuclear energy &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; DW.COM &amp;#124; 27.01.2013 |website=Dw.de |date=2016-01-21 |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On [[Bulgarian referendum, 2016|6 November 2016]] a three question referendum was held alongside the presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Republic of Bulgaria: Referendum, 6 November 2016|url=http://www.electionguide.org/elections/id/2988/|website=ElectionGuide|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Several regional referendums have been held as well.

===Croatia===
{{main article|Elections_in_Croatia#Referendums}}
Referendums in Croatia can be called by:
* The [[Croatian Parliament]]
* The [[President of Croatia]]

The institution of a referendum is regulated by article 87. of the [[constitution of Croatia]]. Referendums can be called on any issue falling within the competence of the [[Croatian Parliament]] or on any other issue which the [[President of Croatia]] considers to be important for the [[independence]], unity and existence of the Republic.

Since amendments to the constitution in 2001, the Parliament is obligated by [[Constitution of Croatia|constitution]] to call a referendum if signatures of 10% of registered voters in the Republic of Croatia are collected. The time frame for collecting the signatures is defined by the law on referendums, and it is 15 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zakon o referendumu i drugim oblicima osobnog sudjelovanja u obavljanju državne vlasti i lokalne i područne (regionalne) samouprave|url=http://www.zakon.hr/z/359/Zakon-o-referendumu-i-drugim-oblicima-osobnog-sudjelovanja-u-obavljanju-dr%C5%BEavne-vlasti-i-lokalne-i-podru%C4%8Dne-(regionalne)-samouprave|accessdate=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyprus===
{{main article|Elections_in_Cyprus#Referendums}}
[[Constitution of Cyprus]] has no mention of referendum (as of 2013). The only referendum to take place in independent Cyprus was [[Cypriot Annan Plan referendums, 2004|a referendum on the Annan Plan]].

===Czech Republic===
{{main article|Elections in the Czech Republic#Referendums}}

There are no provisions concerning referendums in the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]], except for "referendum concerning the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union". Therefore, the only referendum ever held in the Czech Republic at the national level was [[Czech European Union membership referendum, 2003|Czech European Union membership referendum]] in 2003.

It is possible to hold a referendum at regional and municipal levels.

===Denmark===
{{main article|Elections in Denmark#Referendums}}
In Denmark, after a law has been passed by parliament, one third of the members can demand a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;Danmarks riges grundlov §42&lt;/ref&gt; This does not apply to money bills or [[Eminent domain|expropriation]]. A law that transfers [[sovereignty]] to an international organisation must be subjected to a referendum unless five sixth of the MPs vote for it. In both cases, to defeat the law the no votes must not only outnumber the yes votes, they must also number at least 30% of the electorate. Since all referendums have had much more than 60% turnout, no bill has yet passed due to lack of interest.

In practice, referendums have been held every time new [[treaties of the European Union]] have been approved, even when more than five sixths can be found. Recently, the Danish government was highly criticized when it did not hold a referendum regarding the controversial [[Lisbon treaty]].

The [[Constitution of Denmark]] can be changed only after a referendum. To pass, the yes votes must not only outnumber the no votes, they must also number at least 40% of the electorate.

The present location of the border with [[Germany]] was determined by a referendum in 1920 after the German [[capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]]. See [[Schleswig]].

===Estonia===
{{Main article|Elections in Estonia#Referendums}}

The [[Constitution of Estonia]] gives the [[Parliament of Estonia]] the power to submit a bill or other national issue to a binding referendum. If a bill which is submitted to a referendum does not receive a majority of votes in favour, the President of the Republic shall declare extraordinary elections to the Parliament.

There are some issues which cannot be submitted to the referendum: issues regarding the budget, taxation, financial obligations of the state, ratification and denunciation of international treaties, the declaration or termination of a state of emergency, or national defence.

Some parts of the Constitution can be amended only by a referendum, while the rest of Constitution can be amended either by a referendum or by other means.

A referendum was called by the Parliament of Estonia on two occasions since its independence from [[USSR]] was restored:
* [[Estonian referendum, 1992|a referendum on a new constitution and citizenship]] in 1992
* [[Estonian European Union membership referendum, 2003|Estonian European Union membership referendum]] in 2003
Also, there was [[Estonian independence referendum, 1991|a referendum on Estonian independence]] in 1991 while [[Estonian SSR]] was still a part of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].

===Finland===
{{Main article|Elections in Finland#Referendums}}

The [[Constitution of Finland]] allows only for a non-binding referendum called on by the Parliament. If 50,000 Finnish citizens sign an initiative (for an [[Act of Parliament|act]] or a referendum), the Parliament has to discuss it, but the initiative is not binding.

As of 2013 there have been only two referendums in Finland:
* [[Finnish prohibition referendum, 1931|Finnish prohibition referendum]] in 1931
* [[Finnish European Union membership referendum, 1994|Finnish European Union membership referendum]] in 1994.

===France===
{{Main article|Elections in France#Referendums}}
The practice of referendums for tough decisions appeared with [[Charles De Gaulle]]'s [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]], in order to overcome the Parliament. A referendum can be called by the President for [[French Matignon Accords referendum, 1988|constitutional changes]], [[French European Constitution referendum, 2005|treaty ratification]], laws concerning the administration or the territory. The political risks involved made the practice rare. Most constitutional revisions went through the [[super-majority]] of Parliament. Therefore, a procedure of popular initiative, backed by a handful of MPs, is being put in place.

===Germany===
{{main article|Referendums in Germany}}
Following World War II, the new western republic (Federal Republic of Germany) was founded with only minor elements of direct democracy. On the federal level, there are only two mandatory constitutional referendum types. One type is for enacting a new constitution. Changes to the constitution do not require a public vote and there is no provision for an initiative for a constitutional amendment. There has never been a referendum of this type, although there was an argument in that direction during [[German reunification]]. The other type requires a public vote in case of restructuring the [[States of Germany|Bundesländer]] i.e. States ("Neugliederung des Bundesgebietes", ''New Arrangement of the Federal Territory'') which led to a referendum on the merger of Baden and Württemberg into [[Baden-Württemberg#History|Baden-Württemberg]] in 1951 (accepted) and a referendum on the merger of Berlin and Brandenburg into Berlin-Brandenburg in 1996 (rejected).

Originally none of the Bundesländer (federated states) had provisions for a general binding referendum ("Volksentscheid" ''people's decision''). Only Hesse and Bavaria have a mandatory binding referendum on changes to the state constitution. However, most states have a form of non-binding ballot question ("Volksbefragung" ''people's inquiry'') which has rarely been used - the most important one had been the [[Saar Statute referendum, 1955]]. General forms of direct democracy were first introduced in the communities with facultative ballot questions ("Bürgerbefragung" ''citizens inquiry'') and public initiatives ("Bürgerbegehren" ''citizens request'') that are both non-binding. In some areas, this has been expanded into a binding referendum type ("Bürgerentscheid" ''citizens decision'') but almost universally facultative. In some states, there is a general right on state popular initiatives ("Volksbegehren" ''people's request'') which was used in Hamburg to push the state government to pass a law on a facultative binding state referendum ("Volksentscheid") in 2007.

===Greece===
{{Main article|Elections in Greece#Referendums}}

The [[Constitution of Greece|Constitution]] provides for two kinds of referendums:
* a referendum concerning a "passed law"
* a referendum concerning a matter of "national interest".

There were 8 referendums in [[Greece]] from 1920 to now. All but two have had to do with the [[form of government]], namely retention/reestablishment or abolition of the [[List of kings of Greece|monarchy]]. The two referendums not concerning the form of government was [[Greek constitutional referendum, 1968|constitutional referendum]] in 1968 held by the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|military junta]], and the [[Greek bailout referendum, 2015|2015 Greek bailout referendum]].

===Hungary===
{{Main article|Elections in Hungary#Referendums}}
The [[Constitution of Hungary|Constitution]] proscribes two ways to hold a referendum:
* upon the motion of at least two hundred thousand electors
* upon the motion of the President of the Republic, the Government or one hundred thousand electors.

The Constitution imposes a number of prohibitions on matters on which a referendum can be held, including amending Constitution, budget, taxing, obligations from international agreements, military operations, etc. Required [[voter turnout]] for the referendum to be valid is 50%. The decision made by a referendum is binding on the Parliament. There was one referendum in [[People's Republic of Hungary]] and there were 5 referendums in modern (post-1989) Hungary.

===Iceland===
The [[constitution of Iceland]] provides two articles on referendums:
* According to the 11th article, if 3/4 of the [[Althing|parliament]] votes to dismiss the [[president of Iceland|president]] then that decision must be put to a binding referendum.
* According to the 26th article, should the president veto a bill from the parliament then it must be put to a binding referendum.

A total of 7 referendums have been held in [[Iceland]], three of which were held after the nation declared independence and became a republic in 1944.

===Ireland===
{{Main article|Elections in the Republic of Ireland#Referendums}}

====Constitutional referendums====
The current [[Constitution of Ireland]] was adopted by plebiscite on 1 July 1937. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] every constitutional amendment must be approved by referendum; 37 such referendums have occurred from the enactment of the current constitution to October of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionsireland.org/results/referendum/summary.cfm |title=Summary of Constitutional Referendums |publisher=Elections Ireland |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constitutional amendments are first adopted by both Houses of the [[Oireachtas]] (parliament), submitted to a referendum, and are signed into law by the [[President of Ireland|President]]. The signature is merely a formality: the president cannot refuse to sign into law an amendment that has been approved in a referendum.

====Ordinary referendums====
Article 27 of the constitution provides for a referendum on an ordinary bill, known as an '[[ordinary referendum]]'.

This can occur in two circumstances.
First, if a bill is simply passed in the ordinary manner with a provision that it be sent to referendum.  Second, a bill that, in the opinion of the President, "is of such national importance that the will of the people ought to be ascertained" if requested to do so by a majority of the Senate and a third of [[Dail Eireann]].  Article 27 was intended for bills that were particularly contentious, controversial or of high importance.  Despite there having been many bills fitting these criteria, article 27 has never been used.

===Italy===
{{Main article|Referendums in Italy}}
The constitution of [[Italy]] provides for two kinds of binding referendums.

A legislative referendum can be called in order to abrogate a law totally or partially, if requested by 500,000 electors or five regional councils. This kind of referendum is valid only if at least a majority of electors goes to the polling station. It is forbidden to call a referendum regarding financial laws or laws relating to pardons or the ratification of international treaties.

A constitutional referendum can be called in order to approve a constitutional law or amendment only when it has been approved by the Houses ([[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]] and [[Italian Senate|Senate of the Republic]]) with a majority of less than two thirds in both or either House, and only at the request of one fifth of the members of either House, or 500,000 electors or five [[Regional Council (Italy)|Regional Councils]]. A constitutional referendum is valid no matter how many electors go to the polling station. Any citizen entitled to vote in an election to the Chamber of Deputies may participate in a referendum.

===Latvia===
{{Main article|Elections in Latvia#Referendums}}

The [[Constitution of Latvia]] proscribes a referendum for five purposes:
* recalling of the Parliament
* acceding to the European Union
* accepting substantial changes in the terms regarding the membership in the European Union
* accepting legislation suspended by the President
* amending the Constitution or adopting a law

One tenth or registered voters has the right to initiate a national referendum regarding recalling of the Parliament. [[Voter turnout]] needed is two thirds of the number of the voters who participated in the last elections for the Parliament.

Substantial changes in the terms regarding the membership of Latvia in the European Union shall be decided by a national referendum if such referendum is requested by at least one-half of the members of the Parliament.

A referendum will be held on a law if a President suspends it, and in a two-month period one tenth of the [[wikt:electorate|electorate]] requests a referendum, except if the Parliament again adopts the law with three three-quarters [[super-majority]]. [[Voter turnout]] needed is 50% of the number of the voters who participated in the last elections for the Parliament.

The constitution limits issues which can be submitted to a referendum. It forbids issues like budget, taxes, military conscription, declaration of war, peace treaties, agreements with other nations, etc.; according to the Constitutional Court of Latvia, the intent of initiators to organise a referendum cannot entail repeal of ‘the principle of wholeness of the Constitution of Latvia’ that ‘prohibits interpretation of separate norms of the Constitution of Latvia as isolated from the other Constitution of Latvia norms, because the Constitution of Latvia as a document, which is a cohesive whole, influences the contents and sense of the norm’; this means that at least the basic human rights and general principles of law listed in the Constitution of Latvia—such as the right of minorities to preserve and develop their language and their ethnic and cultural identity, the rights of a child, and the right to equality and non-discrimination, not to mention the principles of proportionality, legal certainty, and legitimate expectations —have to be honoured in the interpretation of all proposed amendments&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juridicainternational.eu/index.php?id=15331 Jarinovska, K. "Popular Initiatives as Means of Altering the Core of the Republic of Latvia", ''Juridica International''. Vol. 20, 2013.  p. 152], {{ISSN|1406-5509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One tenth of the electorate can request amendment of the Constitution adoption of a law. Absolute majority is required for such a referendum to pass. The exception is decision regarding substantial changes in the terms regarding membership in the EU - those measures need voter turnout of 50% of the number of the voters who participated in the last elections for the Parliament.

There were 13 referendums in Latvia's history, of that 4 in 1923 - 1934 period and 9 since 1991.

===Lithuania===
{{Main article|Referendums in Lithuania}}
Lithuania has held 12 referendums since 1991.

===Luxembourg===
{{Main article|Elections in Luxembourg#Referendums}}

The [[Constitution of Luxembourg]] mentions the referendum in Article 51: "Voters will be asked to vote by way of referendum in the cases and under the conditions determined by law." The only details about execution of referendums are found in Article 114 which deals with constitutional amendments. There are no other provisions regarding referendums in Luxembourg.

The referendum on constitutional amendment (defined in Article 114) is binding. Referendums in general (defined in Article 51) are not explicitly stated to be binding.

There were four referendums in Luxembourg since 1919:
* [[Luxembourgian referendum, 1919|the referendum on head of state and economic union]] in 1919
* [[Luxembourgian political parties referendum, 1937|the referendum on banning the Communist party]] in 1937
* [[Luxembourgian European Constitution referendum, 2005|European Constitution referendum]] in 2005
* [[Luxembourg referendum, 2015|the referendum on election rules]] in 2015

===Malta===
{{Main article|Elections in Malta#Referendums}}
There are three types of referendums in Malta: constitutional, consultative and abrogative referendums.

Constitutional referendums are required by article 66(3) of the [[Constitution of Malta]]. While binding, it is limited to the single instance of amending the Constitutional provision on the maximum parliamentary term of five years. This type of referendum has never taken place.

The other categories of referendums are regulated by the Referenda Act. "Consultative" referendums (the Act does not use the term) can either take place prior to the assent of a bill in the [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]] or following the parliamentary procedure in a form of a conditional clause in the said bill. In the former case it would not legally bind Parliament to approve the said legislation irrelevant of the result of the said referendum, however the latter case, it would be conventionally binding on the President to promulgate the bill into law. There has been five referendums like this on a national level, one on a regional level ([[Gozo Civic Council referendum, 1973]]) and a number of local referendums organised by single [[Local councils of Malta|Local Councils]].

An abrogative referendum has never been held and, if invoked and successful, can abrogate pieces of legislation barring some exceptions, notably financial and constitutional law.

===Moldova===
{{Main article|Referendums in Moldova}}
According to Article 75 of the [[Constitution of Moldova]], "(1) Problems of utmost gravity or urgency confronting the Moldovan society or State shall be resolved by referendum. (2) The decisions passed in consequence of the results produced by the republican referendum have supreme judicial power." There were two referendums held in [[Moldova]], in [[Moldovan referendum, 1994|1994]] and [[Moldovan constitutional referendum, 2010|2010]].

===Netherlands===
{{Main article|Referendums in the Netherlands}}
Since 1 July 2015, most laws can be subjected to a consultative referendum after their approval by the [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]], following a request by 300,000 people.

Before that date, in principle, there was no permanent provision in law for a referendum. However, from 2002 until 2005, there was a Temporary Referendum Law in place, which allowed for non-binding referendums, known in Dutch as ''Volksraadpleging'' ("People's Consultation"), to be organised for laws already approved by the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]]. No referendum was called based on this law.

In order to hold the [[Dutch European Constitution referendum, 2005|2005 referendum]] on the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]], a different law was temporarily put in place. That referendum was the first national referendum in the Netherlands in 200 years ([[Batavian Republic constitutional referendum, 1805]]), and it was the result of an initiative proposal by parliamentarians [[Farah Karimi]] ([[GroenLinks]]), Niesco Dubbelboer ([[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour]]) and [[Boris van der Ham]] ([[Democrats 66]]).

The [[Dutch Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement referendum, 2016]] is the most recent Dutch referendum; the [[Dutch Intelligence and Security Services Act referendum, 2018]] was approved to be held next March.

===Norway===
The Norwegian Constitution does not mention referendums at all, and as such, referendums are not a part of Norwegian political practice. However, six advisory referendums have been held in Norway, most notably, the referendums on Norwegian EU membership, and [[Norwegian union dissolution referendum, 1905|the referendum for dissolving the union with Sweden]]. It is worth noting that these referendums, and potential future referendums, although legitimate as part of Norwegian [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]], will not have any ''legal binding'': They will merely be advisory, and the final decision will be taken by the Norwegian parliament, who may choose (albeit unlikely) to disregard the will of the Norwegian people as expressed through the referendum.

===Poland===
{{Main article|Referendums in Poland}}
There have been four referendums in the modern Poland: 
* two in 1996:
** [[Polish referendums, 1996|General property enfranchisement of citizens referendum]]
** [[Polish referendums, 1996|Referendum about certain ways of use of public property]]
* one in 1997 - [[Polish constitutional referendum, 1997|Referendum on the Constitution]]
* one in 2003 - [[Polish referendum on joining the EU, 2003|Referendum on joining the EU]]

A [[Polish European Constitution referendum|referendum on a proposed EU constitution]] was planned in 2005, but has been put on hold after the [[French European Constitution referendum, 2005|rejection of constitution by French voters]].

===Portugal===
{{Main article|Elections in Portugal#Referendums}}
The referendum in [[Portugal]] is called by the [[President of Portugal]] (if he so decides), on a proposal submitted by the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly]] or the [[Government of Portugal|Government]]. Referendums are binding if [[voter turnout|turnout]] is higher than 50% of registered voters. Citizens of Portugal have the right to submit to the Assembly an initiative for a referendum.

The referendum can be held only on "important issues concerning the national interest". The referendum cannot be held on amendments to the Constitution, and some issues such as budget and competences of the Assembly.

There have been three referendums in modern Portugal:
* [[Portuguese abortion referendum, 1998|abortion referendum]] of 1998
* [[Portuguese regionalisation referendum, 1998|regionalisation referendum]] of 1998
* [[Portuguese abortion referendum, 2007|abortion referendum]] of 2007
All three referendums had turnouts of less than 50%, which meant they were not binding. Nonetheless, the winning option on all three referendums was honoured by the governments of the time.

===Romania===
{{Main article|Elections_in_Romania#Referendums}}
The [[Constitution of Romania]] defines that a referendum has to be called to suspend the President from office, or amend the Constitution. Moreover, a referendum can be called on matters of national interest by the [[President of Romania]] after consultation with Parliament.

There have been 6 referendums in post-communist Romania:
* 3 constitutional referendums: in [[Romanian constitutional referendum, 1991|1991]], in [[Romanian constitutional referendum, 2003|2003]] and in [[Romanian constitutional referendum, 2018|2018]]
* 2 presidential impeachment referendums: in [[Romanian presidential impeachment referendum, 2007|May 2007]] and in [[Romanian presidential impeachment referendum, 2012|2012]]
* [[Romanian voting system referendum, 2007|voting system referendum]] in November 2007
* [[Romanian parliamentary reform referendum, 2009|parliamentary reform referendum]] in 2009

===Russia===
The [[Russia]]n [[Constitution of Russia|Constitution of 1993]] was adopted by a [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|controversial]] [[Russian constitutional referendum, 1993|referendum]].

===Serbia===
{{Main article|Serbian constitutional referendum, 2006}}
The [[Constitution of Serbia|Constitution of the Republic of Serbia]] was adopted on a referendum held in 28–29 October 2006. The constitutional referendum passed with 3,521,724 voting a 53.04% majority. 3,645,517 or 54.91% voted on the referendum, which made it legitimate.

===Slovenia===
There was an independence referendum in [[Slovenia]] on 23 December 1990. The turnout was 93.3% of all voters, of which 94.8% cast a vote in support of independence. It was the first such referendum in one of the then [[Yugoslavia]]n republics. The results were announced on 26 December, and on 25 June 1991, the Slovenian parliament passed an independence law proclaiming Slovenia a sovereign country. This was followed by the [[Ten-Day War]], in which Slovenian forces drove the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] out of the country.&lt;ref name="Juberias"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://crnvo.me/docs/biblio_eng/p10.pdf |title=Legal Aspects for Referendum in Montenegro in the Context of International Law and Practice |date=November 2005 |chapter=Some legal (and political) considerations about the legal framework for referendum in Montenegro, in the light of European experiences and standards |last=Flores Juberías |first=Carlos |page=74 |publisher=Foundation Open Society Institute, Representative Office Montenegro |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426081759/http://crnvo.me/docs/biblio_eng/p10.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="STAT11"&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl=http://www.stat.si/letopis/2011/05_11/05-11-11.htm |title=Statistični letopis 2011 |trans-title=Statistical Yearbook 2011 |chapter=Volitve |trans-chapter=Elections |page=108 |publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia |work=Statistical Yearbook 2011 |year=2011 |volume=15 |ISSN=1318-5403}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Slovenia held [[Slovenian same-sex marriage referendum, 2015|another referendum]] on a bill legalizing same-sex marriage, which was rejected by the majority of voters.

===Spain===
In a referendum in [[Spain]] (''Referéndum para la reforma política'', literally "Referendum for political reformation") on 15 December 1976, after the death of [[Francisco Franco]], 94% of voters approved a Political Reform Bill to establish democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iberianature.com/spain_culture/timeline-of-spain/spain-in-1976/ |title=Spain in 1976 – iberianature – Spanish history and culture |website=Iberianature.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 December 1978 a further [[Spanish constitutional referendum, 1978|referendum]] was held to approve a new Constitution. Spaniards chose (91.8% of voters) to approve the Constitution. Also, in 1986 another referendum approved Spain's membership of NATO. In 2014 a [[Catalan self-determination referendum, 2014|referendum]] on independence was proposed in [[Catalonia]], although without the approval of the Spanish government.

===Sweden===
{{Main article|Referendums in Sweden}}
The [[Constitution of Sweden]] provides for both binding and non-binding referendums.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Since the introduction of parliamentary democracy, six referendums have been held: the first was about alcohol [[prohibition]] in 1922, and the most recent was about [[euro]] membership in 2003. All have been non-binding, consultative referendums. Two, in 1957 and 1980, were multiple-choice referendums.

===Switzerland===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Swiss Federal Council]] --&gt;
{{See also|Optional referendum|Mandatory referendum}}
[[File:Demo minarette01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Demonstration in Zurich to vote against a [[Swiss minaret ban|referendum which banned minarets]].]]

In [[Switzerland]] Swiss voters can demand a binding referendum at federal, cantonal, and municipal level. They are a central feature of Swiss political life. It is not the government's choice whether or when a referendum is held, but it is a legal procedure regulated by the Swiss constitution. There are two types of referendums:
* '''[[Optional referendum]]''': Any federal law, certain other federal resolutions, and international treaties that are ongoing in nature, or any change to Swiss law may be subject to referendum if at least 50,000 people or eight cantons have petitioned to do so within 100 days. Within cantons and municipalities, the required number of people is smaller, and there may be additional causes for a facultative referendum, e.g., expenditures that exceed a certain amount of money. The facultative referendum is the most common type of referendum, and it is mostly carried out by political parties or by interest groups.
* '''[[Mandatory referendum]]''': There must be a referendum on any amendments to the constitution and on any joining of a multinational community or organization for collective security. In many municipalities, expenditures that exceed a certain amount of money also are subject to the obligatory referendum. Constitutional amendments are proposed by the parliament or by the cantons or by [[federal popular initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bk.admin.ch/themen/pore/vi/index.html?lang=de ''Eidgenössische Volksinitiative''], website of "The Federal Authorities
of the Swiss Confederation" (German, possible to switch to French or Italien language). Retrieved 09-04-2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Citizen's initiatives at the federal level need to collect 100,000 valid signatures within 18 months, and must not contradict international laws or treaties. Often, parliament elaborates a counter-proposal to an initiative, leading to a multiple-choice referendum. Very few such initiatives pass the vote, but more often, the parliamentary counter proposal is approved.

[[File:Swiss voting material.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The extensive, official voting and election material regularly sent to every citizen each time usually four times a year, compromising the pros and cons by all political proponents; here, to [[Bern#Parliament|Berne]]'s citizen in November 2008.]]
The possibility of facultative referendums forces the parliament to search for a compromise between the major interest groups. In many cases, the mere threat of a facultative referendum or of an initiative is enough to make the parliament adjust a law.

The referendums are said, by their adversaries, to slow politics down. On the other hand, empirical scientists, e.g. [[Bruno S. Frey]] among many, show that this and other instruments of citizens' participation, [[direct democracy]], contribute to stability and happiness.

The votes on referendums are always held on a weekend (the voting's official date is set to Sundays), typically three or four times a year, and in most cases, the votes concern several referendums at the same time, usually at different political levels (federal, cantonal, municipal) about several different subjects. Referendums are also often combined with elections. Voter turnout is around 40% to 50%, unless there is an election or the subject of a referendum is of a critical nature. The decisions made in referendums tend to be conservative. Citizens' initiatives are usually not passed. The federal rule and referendums have been regularly used in Switzerland since its inauguration as a [[Modern history of Switzerland|modern state]]: [[Voting in Switzerland|almost 600 national votes have been held]] since 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/explore-600-national-votes_how-direct-democracy-has-grown-over-the-decades/41481992 |title=How direct democracy has grown over the decades |author=Duc-Quang Nguyen |publisher=swissinfo.ch - a branch of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation SRG SSR |date=17 June 2015 |location=Berne, Switzerland |accessdate=2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crimean status referendum, 2014 was a referendum on the status of [[Crimea]] held on March 16, 2014, by the legislature of [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] as well as by the local government of [[Sevastopol]], both [[Administrative divisions of Ukraine|subdivisions of Ukraine]] at the time. The referendum asked the people of Crimea whether they wanted to join [[Russia]] as a [[federal subjects of the Russian Federation|federal subject]], or if they wanted to restore the [[Constitution of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea|1992 Crimean constitution]] and Crimea's status as a part of [[Ukraine]].

The available choices did not include keeping the [[status quo]] of Crimea and Sevastopol as they were at the moment the referendum was held. The [[Constitution of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea|1992 constitution]] accords greater powers to the Crimean parliament including full sovereign powers to establish relations with other states, therefore many commentators argued that both provided referendum choices would result in [[de facto]] separation from Ukraine.&lt;ref name=globeyes&gt;{{cite news|last=SAIDEMAN|first=STEPHEN|quote="... voters in Crimea next Sunday will be asked whether they support the union of Crimea with Russia (an act of [[irredentism]]) or whether Crimea should be independent (secession).

Russia officially recognized the results of the Crimean referendum and claims that unilateral [[Kosovo]] declaration of independence has set a precedent, which allows secession of Crimea from Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web| url=http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/6889|title= Address by President of the Russian Federation| quote = Moreover, the Crimean authorities referred to the well-known Kosovo precedent – a precedent our western colleagues created with their own hands in a very similar situation, when they agreed that the unilateral separation of [[Kosovo]] from [[Serbia]], exactly what Crimea is doing now, was legitimate and did not require any permission from the country's central authorities. Pursuant to Article 2, Chapter 1 of the United Nations Charter, the UN International Court agreed with this approach and made the following comment in its ruling of July 22, 2010, and I quote: "No general prohibition may be inferred from the practice of the Security Council with regard to declarations of independence," and "General international law contains no prohibition on declarations of independence."

The official result from the Autonomous Republic of Crimea was a 96.77 percent vote for integration of the region into the Russian Federation with an 83.1 percent [[voter turnout]]. The Mejlis Deputy Chairman Akhtem Chiygoz stated that the actual turnout could not have exceed 30–40 percent,whilst former Russian government adviser Andrey Illarionov stated that the actual support for the reunification of Crimea with Russia was about 34 percent, citing results of previous polls over past three years. However, according to the [[Gallup (company)|Gallup's]] survey performed on 21–27 April, 82.8% of Crimean people consider the referendum results reflecting most Crimeans’ views, and 73.9% of Crimeans say Crimea's becoming part of Russia will make life better for themselves and their families, just 5.5% disagree.

Following the referendum, [[Supreme Council of Crimea]] and [[Sevastopol City Council]] declared independence of [[Crimea]] from Ukraine and [[Accession of Crimea to the Russian Federation|requested to join the Russian Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gavin Hewitt |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26609667 |title=Crimean parliament formally applies to join Russia |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2014-03-17 |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, Russia recognized Crimea as a sovereign state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vasovic |first=Aleksandar |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/17/us-ukraine-crisis-idUSBREA1Q1E820140317 |title=U.S., EU set sanctions as Putin recognizes Crimea sovereignty |publisher=Reuters |date=2014-03-17 |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/world/europe/us-imposes-new-sanctions-on-russian-officials.html?hp&amp;_r=0 Putin Recognizes Crimea Secession, Defying the West], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|Referendums in the United Kingdom}}
[[File:ScottishParliamentFront.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Scottish Parliament]] was created through the [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1997]].]]
Although Acts of Parliament may permit referendums to take place, the doctrine of [[parliamentary sovereignty]] means any Act of Parliament giving effect to a referendum result could be reversed by a subsequent Act of Parliament. As a result, referendums in the [[United Kingdom]] cannot be constitutionally binding, although they will usually have a persuasive political effect.

Major referendums are rare; only three have been put to the entire UK electorate. The first was the [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975]], which was held two years after British accession to the [[European Economic Community]] to gauge support for continued membership. The second was the [[United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, 2011]]. This was to vote on changing the '[[Plurality voting system|First Past the Post]]' system to an alternative [[voting system|electoral system]], the [[Instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]].

Referendums have been held in individual parts of the United Kingdom on issues relating to [[devolution]] in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], an elected [[Mayor of London]] and a [[Greater London Authority]] for [[Greater London]], a regional assembly for the [[North East England|North-East]] of [[England]] and the constitutional status and governance of [[Northern Ireland]]. Since 1973, the year of the first such plebiscite, there have been nine major referendums.

In 2004, [[Her Majesty's Government]] promised a UK-wide referendum on the new [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]], but this was postponed in 2005 following the defeats of the [[French European Constitution referendum, 2005|French]] and [[Dutch European Constitution referendum, 2005|Dutch]] referendums. Due to the replacement of the European Constitution with the [[Treaty of Lisbon]], there was no obligation for a referendum. Referendums have also been proposed, but not held, on the replacement of the [[pound sterling]] with the [[euro]] as the [[currency]] of the United Kingdom.

A [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|national referendum]] was held in Scotland on the 18th of September 2014. Voters were asked to answer Yes or No to the question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" to which 55% of Scots voted "No".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/scotland-decides/ |title=Scottish independence referendum |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the local level, the Government has put proposals for directly-elected mayors to 37 local authority areas by referendum. The 1972 Local Government Act also contains a little-used provision that allows non-binding local referendums on any issue to be called by small groups of voters. [[Strathclyde Regional Council]] held a postal referendum in 1994 on whether control of water and sewerage services should be transferred to appointed boards: this was largely a political tactic, since this was the policy of the UK Government at the time. The UK Parliament enacted the legislation anyway, and it came into force on 1 April 1996.

On Thursday 23 June 2016 a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|third UK-wide referendum]] was held on the issue of the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom's]] continuing membership of the [[European Union]] 41 years after the [[United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum, 1975|first referendum]]. The referendum was called by the Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] and [[Her Majesty's Government]] after an agreement was struck in [[Brussels]] with the [[European Union]] which renegotiated the membership of the [[United Kingdom]]. This referendum resulted in a majority voting to leave the EU by 52% of voters as opposed to 48% of voters who voted to remain, causing unprecedented ramifications both within the UK, Europe and internationally, and forced the resignation of [[David Cameron]] the following day and he officially left office on July 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-36615028|title=Brexit: David Cameron to quit after UK votes to leave EU |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==North America==

===Canada===
{{Main article|Referendums in Canada}}

Referendums are rare in [[Canada]] and only three have ever occurred at the federal level: 1898 on Prohibition, 1942 on WWII conscription, and 1992 on the [[Charlottetown Accord]]. Although the [[Constitution of Canada]] does not expressly require that amendments be approved by referendum, many argue that, in light of the precedent set by the Charlottetown Accord referendum, this may have become a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]].

A referendum can also occur at the provincial level. The [[1980 Quebec referendum|1980]] and [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995]] referendums on the secession of [[Québec]] are notable cases. In conjunction with the [[Ontario general election, 2007|provincial election]] in 2007, the province of [[Ontario]] voted on a mixed-member proportional representation electoral system and [[British Columbia]] held two consecutive referendums on [[BC-STV]] in 2005 and 2009. In 2011 [[British Columbia]] held yet another referendum against a newly imposed HST tax. The results ended up making British Columbia the first province to overturn the harmonization of provincial and federal taxes, joining it with Alberta, which not having a provincial sales tax, has never participated in the HST. A referendum was held in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island on November 28, 2005 to determine whether or not to adopt the Mixed Member Proportional Representation System. The referendum failed.

===United States===
{{Main article|Initiatives and referendums in the United States}}

There is no provision for the holding of referendums at the federal level in the United States, which the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] does not provide for.  

However, 24 states (principally in the West, but also in Eastern states, such as [[Massachusetts]]) and many local and city governments provide for referendums and citizen's initiatives. Such state-level referendums, as an example, have resulted in the limitation of [[property tax]]es as with California's [[Proposition 13]] and Massachusetts' [[Proposition 2½]] in the late 20th century.

==Central and South America==

===Brazil===
Three nationwide referendums have been held so far in Brazilian history.

In [[Brazilian constitutional referendum, 1963|1963]], the country had just adopted the [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary government system]], but in a referendum held in 1963, the Brazilian population was consulted about which government system should be enacted in the country and it was decided to have Brazil return to a Presidential system.

In [[Brazilian constitutional referendum, 1993|1993]], another referendum to decide Brazil's government system was held. Voters could choose to keep the presidential republic system, adopt a parliamentary republic system, or adopt a parliamentary monarchy system. The majority of voters opined to maintain the current presidential government system.

In [[Brazilian firearms and ammunition referendum, 2005|2005]] a referendum was held to consult the population about their opinion on the possibility of forbidding the sale and civilian possession of firearms and ammunition nationwide. This referendum was offered by the government as part of a violence minimization initiative known as ''project disarmament.'' Most voters declared themselves contrary to the ban and the laws regarding commerce and ownership of weapons in the country remained unaltered.

===Chile===
There have been four plebiscites and one "consultation" in Chilean history. In 1925, a plebiscite was held over a new constitution that would replace a semi-parliamentary system with a presidential one. The "Yes" vote won overwhelmingly, with 95% of the vote.

In 1978, after the [[United Nations]] protested against [[Pinochet]]'s régime, the country's military government held a national consultation, which asked if people supported Pinochet's rule. The "Yes" vote won with 74%, although the results have been questioned.

Another [[Chilean national plebiscite, 1980|constitutional plebiscite]] was held in 1980. The "Yes" won with 68.5%, prolonging Pinochet's term until 1989 and replacing the 1925 Constitution with a new one still used today. The results of this plebiscite have also been questioned by Pinochet's opponents, because of the lack of voters registration.

In a historical plebiscite held in 1988, 56% voted to end the military régime. The next year, yet another plebiscite was held for constitutional changes for the transition to a democratic government (the "Yes" vote won with 91%).

There have been several referendums in individual municipalities in Chile since the return to civilian rule in 1990. A referendum, which took place in 2006 in [[Las Condes]], over the construction of a mall was noteworthy for being the first instance in Chilean history where electronic voting machines were used.

===Costa Rica===
The first referendum held in [[Costa Rica]] was October 7, 2007, to approve or reject the [[free trade agreement]] with [[Central America]], [[Dominican Republic]] (Costa Rica already has FTAs with the latter) and the [[United States]] known as the [[Dominican Republic – Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (DR-CAFTA).

It was very narrowly approved (49.030 votes). Results were 51.62% voted in favour and 48.38% against it. It is currently the only free trade agreement in the world that has been approved on a referendum.

From 2008 to 2010 conservative groups, linked to religious institutions, managed to collect 150,000 signatures to call a referendum to decline unions between same-sex couples. The Supreme Elections Tribunal (TSE) had scheduled the consultation on December 5, 2010.

However, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court rejected the referendum stating that "The rights of minorities that arise from anti-majoritarian claims can not be subjected to a referendum process which the majority imposes". This consideration supports the main argument of those who rejected the consultation considered a violation of human rights, among these gay groups and humanitarian actors.

The Board further considered that "people who have sex with same sex are a group at disadvantage and discrimination, which requires the support of public authorities for the recognition of their constitutional rights or other legislation". Decisions of the Constitutional Court are final so the ruling stopped the referendum and opened to the Congress the opportunity to continue discussing the bill on the recognition of homosexual unions.

===Puerto Rico===
Four [[Puerto Rican status referendums]] (in 1967, 1993, 1998 and 2012) have taken place in [[Puerto Rico]] to determine whether the [[United States insular area|insular area]] should become an [[Puerto Rican independence movement|independent nation]] (comprising a [[republic]] and an associated republic), apply for [[U.S. state|statehood]], or maintain [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|commonwealth]] (''Estado Libre Asociado'') status. Remaining a commonwealth has been the result of the first three referendums. The [[Puerto Rican status referendum, 2012|fourth referendum]] resulted in a majority being pro-statehood. There was also a 2005 referendum (Resolution 64) to determine whether the [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico]] should be restructured (among other changes to become [[unicameralism|unicameral]]).

===Uruguay===
{{Main article|Politics of Uruguay}}
The [[Uruguay]]an constitution allows citizens to challenge laws approved by Parliament by use of a referendum or to propose changes to the Constitution by the use of a plebiscite. This right has been used a few times in the past 15 years: in 1989, to [[Uruguayan amnesty referendum, 1989|confirm or reject an amnesty]] to members of the military who violated human rights during the military regime (1973–1985); [[Uruguayan constitutional referendum, November 1989|in 1989]], to increase pensioners' incomes; [[Uruguayan privatisation referendum, 1992|in 1992]], to consider the partial privatization of public utilities companies; and, [[Uruguayan constitutional referendum, 2004|in 2004]], to maintain water resources in government control.

===Venezuela===
The 1999 constitution of [[Venezuela]], created by the Chávez government, and approved by referendum, brought in the concept of requiring referendums for constitutional changes, as well as providing for recall referendums of elected officials (which require petitions of a minimum percentage of voters to be submitted). In the [[Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004|Venezuelan recall referendum of 2004]] voters determined whether or not [[Hugo Chávez]], the former [[President of Venezuela]], should be recalled from office. The result of the referendum was to not recall Chávez.

==Oceania==

===Australia===
{{Main article|Referendums in Australia}}

Approval in a referendum is necessary in order to [[Amendment|amend]] the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian constitution]]. A bill must first be passed by both houses of Parliament or, in certain limited circumstances, by only one house of Parliament, and is then submitted to a referendum. If a majority of those voting, as well as separate majorities in each of a majority of states (and where appropriate a majority of people in any affected state) vote in favor of the amendment, it is presented for [[Royal Assent]], given in the Queen's name by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]]. Due to the specific mention of referendums in the Australian constitution, non-constitutional referendums are usually termed "plebiscites" in Australia.

===New Zealand===
{{Main article|Referendums in New Zealand}}
[[New Zealand]] has two types of referendum. Government referendums are predominantly about [[New Zealand constitution|constitutional]] issues. However, there are also referendums on other issues. Furthermore, constitutional issues, such as the establishment of the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand]], may be done without a referendum. Government referendums can be binding or non-binding.

Since 1993, New Zealand also has provision for non-binding citizens-initiated referendums. To initiate a citizens-initiated referendum on a particular issue, proponents of the referendum apply to the Clerk of the House of Representatives, and once the question wording is determined, proponents have twelve months to compile a petition containing signatures from at least ten percent of all registered voters. Only five citizens-initiated referendums have gone to a vote: one in 1995, two in 1999, one in 2009 and another to be held in late 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=11132400|title=Govt sets date for asset sale referendum|publisher=The New Zealand Herald|date=30 September 2013|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert E. Murray''' (born January 13, 1940) is an American mining engineer and businessman. He is the [[chief executive officer]] of Murray Energy Corporation, a mining corporation based in [[St. Clairsville, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Message from our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer|url=http://www.murrayenergycorp.com/message-from-the-founder-ceo/|website=Murray Energy Corporation|accessdate=6 November 2017|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the largest independent operators of coal mines in the United States.&lt;ref name="craincleveland"&gt;Bennett, David (Jan. 30, 2007).

''Crain's Cleveland Business''. Retrieved on August 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Murray was born in 1940. His father was [[paralysis|paralyzed]] in a mining accident when Murray was 9 years old.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} As a miner himself, Murray experienced two accidents on the job. Meanwhile, Murray lied about his age so he could work in a coal mine at the age of 16 and provide for his family.&lt;ref name="apbio"&gt;[http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/regional/s_521294.html "Utah mine disaster yields frenetic frontman"]. ''[[Associated Press]]''. Retrieved on August 09, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Murray says that he suffered through several mining accidents, including on one occasion being hit in the head with an {{convert|18|ft|m|adj=on}} beam made of [[steel]].&lt;ref name="apbio"/&gt; Murray says he has one scar running from his head down his back from a separate accident and at one time was trapped in a dark mine for 12 hours before being rescued.&lt;ref name="apbio"/&gt;

Murray was valedictorian of the [[Bethesda, Ohio|Bethesda]] High School class of 1957.&lt;ref name="st141221"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loth|first1=Tim|title=Coal baron Robert Murray is still fired up|url=http://old.seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2025279405_inpersoncoaladvocatexml.html|accessdate=23 August 2017|publisher=Seattlle Times|date=Dec 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray received a Bachelor of Engineering in Mining from [[Ohio State University]] and completed the advanced management program at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Business]].&lt;ref name = bloombergprof&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=25618338&amp;privcapId=22595942| title =Executive Profile Robert Edward Murray | publisher = Bloomberg | accessdate = Aug 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Murray began his mining career at the [[North American Coal Corporation]]. He served in a variety of capacities at NACC, winning election to vice president of operations in 1969. From 1974 to 1983, Murray was president of NACC's Western Division and presided over four of its subsidiaries in [[North Dakota]]. In 1974, a strike took place at the Indian Head Mine in [[Zap, North Dakota|Zap]], which North American was attempting to close.&lt;ref name=bismarck&gt;Donovan, Lauren (Aug. 2007). [http://www.bismarcktribune.com/articles/2007/08/09/news/update/doc46bb2e11c0e3a751467366.txt "Utah mine owner operated in North Dakota mines"]. ''The Bismarck Tribune''. Retrieved on August 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, he became president and [[CEO]] of North American. In 1987, Murray was told by "someone to whom [he] didn't even report" that he was "done" at NACC.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} He later called the firing "the best thing ever to happen" to his career.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Murray is a registered Professional Engineer and private pilot, as well as a member of the boards of directors of the [[National Mining Association]], American Coal Foundation, National Coal Council, Ohio Coal Association, and Pennsylvania Coal Association. Murray is past president and a trustee of the [[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers]], Inc., and the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration, Inc., as well as past president of The Rocky Mountain Coal Mining Institute.&lt;ref name="MECWeb"&gt;Murray Energy Corporation Web site&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murray Energy==
Murray started his company in 1988 with the purchase of a single [[continuous mining]] operation with an annual output of 1 million tons per year. Murray Energy Corporation's strategy involves acquiring high sulfur coal reserves and aiming to be the low-cost producer in primary coal-sourcing regions of the United States. This strategy was based on Murray's belief that the transportation of low-sulfur coal thousands of miles from the [[Powder River Basin]] to meet the growing demand for electricity in some parts of the country was not a viable long-term solution.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} At the helm of Murray Energy, he began accumulating reserves that were strategically located near customers, near favorable transportation, and high in energy content (BTU per pound).

Following this strategy, Murray Energy acquired reserves and expanded its operations in Southern Ohio, Southwestern Pennsylvania, the Illinois Basin (Western Kentucky and Southern Illinois), and reserves and operations in Central Utah.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} One of Murray Energy's first acquisitions was the Powhatan No. 6 mine in [[Alledonia, Ohio]]. The Powhatan mine is the only mine operated by a Murray Energy Corporation independent operating subsidiary that is unionized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Junkins|first1=Casey|title=Murray Energy Powhatan No. 6 Mine Officially Closed Near Beallsville|url=http://www.theintelligencer.net/news/top-headlines/2016/12/murray-energy-powhatan-no-6-mine-officially-closed-near-beallsville/|accessdate=23 August 2017|publisher=Wheeling News-Register|date=Aug 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its mining operations, Murray Energy owns and operates river, truck, and rail terminals on the [[Ohio River]]; a rail loadout facility in Central Utah; and a diesel and mining equipment rebuild facility in West Virginia.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Mr. Murray told the White House in a letter dated August 4, 2017 that without an emergency order to restart coal-fired electrical generating plants, his company and a major customer, power plant operator [[FirstEnergy]] Solutions would declare bankruptcy.&lt;ref name= cnn170822 /&gt;

===Crandall Canyon Mine collapse===
{{Main|Crandall Canyon Mine}}
In August 2007 six miners were trapped at the Crandall Canyon Mine in Utah, of which [[Murray Energy]] independent operating subsidiary [[UtahAmerican Energy]] had been a part-owner for 12 months. Prior to the collapse, the [[Crandall Canyon Mine]] had received 64 violations and $12,000 in fines.&lt;ref name="conferenceslc"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sltrib&gt;[http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_6589559 "Murray's Illinois mine has 2,787 violations since 2005"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011104628/http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_6589559 |date=2007-10-11 }}.

CNN specifically cited Murray's Illinois Galatia mine, which had almost 3,500 safety citations in the prior two and a half years.&lt;ref name=hpostcnn&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/08/23/cnn-delves-into-robert-mu_n_61609.html "CNN Delves Into Robert Murray's Safety Record...17 Days Later "].

Murray claims that the Crandall Canyon Mine collapse was triggered by a 3.9 magnitude [[earthquake]], while government [[seismologist]]s say the mine collapse was the cause of a [[coal mine bump]].&lt;ref name=boston&gt;[http://news.bostonherald.com/national/west/view.bg?articleid=1016033 "Owner of Utah mine is a famously combative figure]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

Douglas S. Dreger, a seismologist at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], said in the July 2008 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' that his analysis strongly suggested that the mountain crumbled in two stages: After the pillars collapsed, giant, angled slabs of [[sandstone]] above the mine abruptly shifted. When the mine collapse finally occurred, it was so powerful that it registered as a 3.9 earthquake.&lt;ref name="yearafter"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26050043/ Year after mine collapse, many failures clear], ''[[Associated Press]]'', Aug. 6, 2008, Retrieved 2008-08-06&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the widely used industry practice of [[retreat mining]] is believed by some observers to be a cause of the mine's 2007 collapse, Murray insists the process was not responsible.&lt;ref name=seattle1&gt;Arrillaga, Pauline (Aug. 9, 2007).

On July 24, 2008, the U.S. government's [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA) announced its highest penalty for coal mine safety violations, $1.85 million, for the collapse. The government fined [[Genwal Resources]] $1.34 million "for violations that directly contributed to the deaths of six miners last year," plus nearly $300,000 for other violations. The government also levied a $220,000 fine against a mining consultant, Agapito Associates, "for faulty analysis of the mine's design."&lt;ref name = "blameoperator"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Crandall Canyon tragedy, the Mine Safety and Health Administration also was faulted by its parent agency, the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], both for lax oversight before the collapse and for its handling of a haphazard rescue effort that left three more people dead.&lt;ref name="yearlater"&gt;Year after mine collapse, many failures clear, Associated Press, Aug. 6, 2008, Retrieved 2008-08-06&lt;/ref&gt; An independent review of MSHA's role in Crandall Canyon by retired MSHA managers Earnest Teaster and Joseph Pavlovich, found that the agency failed to properly consider bounce activity in the mine prior to approving the mining plan, failed to properly evaluate the roof control plan and failed to follow established [[mine rescue]] protocols at all times at Crandall Canyon Mine. Specifically, the authors wrote that, "MSHA's failure to adequately evaluate the roof control plans contributed to the August 6 accident."&lt;ref name="PavTeas"&gt;Teaster, E., Palovich, J., (July, 2008) Independent review of MSHA's actions at Crandall Canyon Mine; U.S. Department of Labor&lt;/ref&gt; An independent review of MSHA's actions at Crandall Canyon also faults the agency for failing to control access to the mine, concluding that "MSHA improperly allowed media representatives and family members to enter the rescue area, and allowed an unlimited number of persons underground during the rescue operation."&lt;ref name="PavTeas"/&gt;

==Political activity==
Since 2005, the Murray Energy PAC has donated over $150,000 to [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] candidates, including donations totaling $30,000 to Senate candidates such as [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]], [[Sam Brownback]], and [[Katherine Harris]].&lt;ref name=cbs1&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/08/08/business/main3144730.shtml?source=RSSattr=Business_3144730 "Mine Collapse: Spotlight On Murray Energy"] (Aug. 8, 2007).

In 2009, Murray Energy donated $20,000 to support the development of a state-of-the-art mine training facility at [[West Virginia University]] &lt;ref&gt;October 21, 2009; WVU dedicates new coal mining simulator; SNL Energy Daily Coal Report.

In addition to serving on the board of directors of the [[National Mining Association]], Murray actively lobbies for pro-industry legislation through his company's [[political action committee]]. In 2001, he testified on behalf of the NMA before a [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means]] subcommittee in favor of proposed tax cuts.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In the wake of 2006's [[Sago Mine disaster]], lawmakers in [[West Virginia]] and [[Ohio]] proposed legislation requiring mine workers to wear emergency tracking devices. Murray lobbied against the laws, calling them "extremely misguided."&lt;ref name=goldman/&gt; He said that politicians were rushing to pass laws and thus "playing politics with the safety of my employees." Murray said that rather than create "knee-jerk" state laws after the disaster, such as in the case of West Virginia, which passed the law in less than one day after it was proposed, the federal government should host a panel which would study the industry and make recommendations for safety measures.&lt;ref name="craincleveland"/&gt;

Murray claimed that the federal government should be involved for uniform standards and because tension between unions and companies created difficulty in reaching private agreement on safety standards. Murray maintained that the personal tracking devices to be mandated in the state laws, called PEDs, did not work under certain common mining conditions (such as below {{convert|600|ft|m}} in depth), and better devices needed to be developed in order to effectively guard miners in case of accident. He said, "The will is there. Unfortunately, the technology isn't."&lt;ref name="craincleveland"/&gt;

Murray has stated that he supported federal mandates for [[drug test]]ing and fire prevention.&lt;ref name="craincleveland"/&gt;

On August 14, 2012, Murray hosted [[Mitt Romney]] at Murray Energy's Century coal mine in Beallsville, Ohio. Several miners contacted a nearby morning talk radio host, David Blomquist to complain that they were forced to attend the rally without pay. Murray chief operating officer Robert Moore said: "Attendance was mandatory but no one was forced to attend the event." Murray closed the mine the day of the rally and suspended pay to workers, arguing that the rally was important to the coal industry and that attending was in the workers' "best interest." Murray and his corporation were a major donor to Romney and other Republicans, and employees report frequent instances of political pressure from management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Banerjee|first=Neela|title=Ohio miners say they were forced to attend Romney rally|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-miners-romney-rally-20120829,0,7736824.story|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=September 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the non-profit group [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] filed a complaint with the [[Federal Election Commission]] against Murray and his company alleging violations of federal campaign law in which employees of Murray Energy were supposedly required to give one percent of their salary to the company's political action committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Kate | last = Sheppard | title = CREW Files FEC Complaint Over Coal Company's Coerced Campaign Donations | date = October 9, 2012 | url = https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/10/crew-files-fec-complaint-over-coal-companys-coerced-campaign-donations | work = [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] | accessdate = October 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2012, three days following the [[United States presidential election, 2012|presidential election]], Murray laid off 156 workers, citing a supposed "war on coal" by the Obama administration as the reason for his decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Mufson |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/after-obama-re-election-ceo-reads-prayer-to-staff-announces-layoffs/2012/11/09/e9bca204-2a63-11e2-bab2-eda299503684_story.html |title=After Obama reelection, Murray Energy CEO reads prayer, announces layoffs |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global warming==
Murray has been a critic of the [[scientific opinion on climate change]]. In June 2007, he told the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works]] that "the science of global warming is suspect." He also wrote in a May 2007 [[MarketWatch]] editorial: "The actual environmental risk associated with [[Carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere|carbon emission]]s is highly speculative."&lt;ref name=goldman/&gt;

In a 2007 speech to the New York Coal Trade Association, Murray called [[Al Gore]] "the [[shaman]] of global gloom and doom" and added "he is more dangerous than his global warming."&lt;ref name=deseret&gt;[http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,695198812,00.html "Heated defense of mining not odd for owner Murray"].

Murray is a particular opponent of proposed global warming legislation in Congress, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We produce a product that is essential to the standard of living of every American because our coal produces 52% of the energy in America today, and it is the lowest cost energy, costing 1/3 to 1/4 the cost of energy from [[natural gas]], [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] and [[renewable energy]] resources. And without coal to manufacture electricity our products will not compete in the [[economic globalization|global marketplace]] against foreign countries because our manufacturers depend on coal, low cost [[electricity]] and people on fixed incomes will not be able to pay their electric bills. Every one of those global warming bills that have been introduced into [[United States Congress|Congress]] today eliminates the coal industry and will increase your electric rates, four to five fold.&lt;ref name="webloggin"&gt;[http://www.webloggin.com/mine/ "Founder of Mine Company Slams Press For Misleading Reporting].

The '''socialist calculation debate''' (sometimes known as the '''economic calculation debate''') was a discourse on the subject of how a [[Socialism|socialist economy]] would perform economic calculation given the absence of the [[law of value]], [[money]], financial prices for [[capital good]]s, and private ownership of the [[means of production]]. More specifically, the debate was centered on the application of [[economic planning]] for the allocation of the means of production as a substitute for capital markets, and whether or not such an arrangement would be superior to [[capitalism]] in terms of efficiency and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, David M. and Sandra J. Peart. "socialist calculation debate." The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. Second Edition. Eds.
Steven N. Durlauf and Lawrence E. Blume. Palgrave Macmillan, 2008. The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics Online. Palgrave Macmillan. 2 February 2013 &lt;http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000535&gt;
doi:10.1057/9780230226203.1570&lt;/ref&gt;

A central aspect of the debate concerned the role and scope of the law of value in a socialist economy.

Although contributions to the question of economic coordination and calculation under socialism existed within the socialist movement prior to the 20th century, the phrase ''socialist calculation debate'' emerged in the 1920s beginning with [[Ludwig von Mises]]' critique of socialism.&lt;ref name="A Companion to the History of Economic Thought, 2006. p. 319"&gt;''A Companion to the History of Economic Thought'', Wiley-Blackwell by Biddle, Jeff and Samuels, Warren and Davis, John. 2006. (p. 319): "What became known as the socialist calculation debate started when von Mises (1935 [1920]) launched a critique of socialism."&lt;/ref&gt; The historical debate was cast between the [[Austrian school of economics]], represented by Ludwig von Mises and [[Friedrich Hayek]], who argued against the feasibility of socialism, and between [[neoclassical economists]] and [[Marxian economists]], most notably [[Cläre Tisch]] (as a forerunner), [[Oskar Lange]], [[Abba Lerner]], [[Fred M. Taylor]], Henry Douglas Dickinson and [[Maurice Dobb]], who took the position that socialism was both feasible and superior to capitalism.

The debate was popularly viewed as a debate between proponents of capitalism and proponents of socialism, but in reality a significant portion of the debate was between socialists who held differing views regarding the utilization of markets and money in a socialist system and to what degree the law of value would continue to operate in a hypothetical socialist economy.&lt;ref name="Economic Calculation under Socialism: The Austrian Contribution, 1980"&gt;''Economic Calculation under Socialism: The Austrian Contribution'', by Vaughn, Karen. 2004.

Debate among socialists has existed since the emergence of the broader socialist movement between those advocating market socialism, centrally planned economies and decentralized economic planning. Recent contributions to the debate in the late 20th century and early 21st century involve proposals for [[market socialism]] and the use of [[information technology]] and [[distributed networking]] as a basis for [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralized economic planning]].

==Foundations and early contributions==
[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] held a broad characterization of socialism, characterized by some form of public or common ownership of the means of production and worker self-management within economic enterprises, and where production of economic value for profit would be replaced by an ''ex ante'' [[Production for use|production directly for use]], which implied some form of economic planning and ''planned'' growth in place of the dynamic of [[capital accumulation]], and therefore the substitution of commodity-based production and market-based allocation of the factors of production with conscious planning.&lt;ref name="The Rise and Fall of Socialist Planning, p. 17"&gt;''The Rise and Fall of Socialist Planning'', Ellman, Michael. (p. 17): "Marx devoted most of his life to the analysis of capitalism and was notoriously opposed to attempts to design utopias. Nevertheless, from his scattered observations about socialism, and from those of his close comrade Engels, his followers drew the idea that in a socialist economy the market mechanism would be replaced by economic planning...Similarly, the superiority of planning, which would enable society as a whole to coordinate production ex ante, became a widespread view in the international Marxist movement."&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Marx and Engels never elaborated on the specific institutions that would exist in socialism or on processes for conducting planning in a socialist system, their broad characterizations laid the foundation for the general conception of socialism as an economic system devoid of the law of value and [[law of accumulation]], and principally, where the category of value was replaced by calculation in terms of natural or physical units so that resource allocation, production and distribution would be considered technical affairs to be undertaken by engineers and technical specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bockman|first= Johanna |title= Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism|publisher= Stanford University Press|year= 2011|month= |isbn= 978-0-8047-7566-3|page = 20|quote= According to nineteenth-century socialist views, socialism would function without capitalist economic categories – such as money, prices, interest, profits and rent – and thus would function according to laws other than those described by current economic science. While some socialists recognized the need for money and prices at least during the transition from capitalism to socialism, socialists more commonly believed that the socialist economy would soon administratively mobilize the economy in physical units without the use of prices or money.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative view of socialism prefiguring the neoclassical models of market socialism consisted of conceptions of market socialism based on [[classical economics|classical economic]] theory and [[Ricardian socialism]], where markets were utilized to allocate capital goods among worker-owned cooperatives in a [[free-market]] economy. The key characteristics of this system involved direct worker ownership of the means of production through producer and consumer cooperatives and the achievement of genuinely [[free market]]s by removing the distorting effects of private property, inequality arising from private appropriation of profits and interest to a rentier class, [[regulatory capture]], and economic exploitation. This view was expounded by [[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualist]] philosophy and was severely criticized by Marxists for failing to address the fundamental issues of capitalism involving instability arising from the operation of the law of value, [[Crisis theory|crises]] caused by over-accumulation of capital and lack of conscious control over the surplus product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= McNally|first= David |title= Against the Market: Political economy, market socialism and the Marxist critique |publisher= Verso|year= 1993|month= |isbn= 978-0-86091-606-2|page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, this perspective played little to no role during the socialist calculation debate in the early 20th century.

Early arguments against the utilization of central economic planning for a socialist economy were brought up by proponents of decentralized economic planning or market socialism, including [[Leon Trotsky]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}, [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. In general, it was argued that centralized forms of economic planning that excluded participation by the workers involved in the industries would not be sufficient at capturing adequate amounts of information to coordinate an economy effectively, while also undermining socialism and the concept of worker's self-management and democratic decision-making central to socialism. However, no detailed outlines for decentralized economic planning were proposed by these thinkers at this time.

===Early neoclassical contributions===
In the early 20th century, [[Enrico Barone]] provided a comprehensive theoretical framework for a planned socialist economy. In his model, assuming perfect computation techniques, simultaneous equations relating inputs and outputs to ratios of equivalence would provide appropriate valuations in order to balance supply and demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gregory and Stuart|first= Paul and Robert |title= Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century, Seventh Edition |publisher=George Hoffman|year= 2004 |isbn= 0-618-26181-8|pages = 120–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed units for accounting and calculation==

===Calculation in kind===
[[Calculation in kind]], or calculation in ''natura'', was often assumed to be the standard form of accounting that would take place in a socialist system where the economy was mobilized in terms of physical or natural units instead of money and financial calculation.

[[Otto Neurath]] was adamant that a socialist economy must be moneyless because measures of money failed to capture adequate information regarding material well-being of consumers or failed to factor in all costs and benefits from performing a particular action. He argued that relying on any single unit – whether they be labor-hours or kilowatt-hours – would be inadequate, and that demand and calculations be performed by the relevant disaggregated natural units (i.e.: kilowatts, tons, meters, etc.).&lt;ref name="Calculation in-Natura, from Neurath to Kantorovich p. 12"&gt;''Calculation in-Natura, from Neurath to Kantorovich'', Cockshott, Paul. (p. 12):&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, Soviet mathematician [[Leonid Kantorovich]] demonstrated how an economy, in purely physical terms, could use determinate mathematical procedure to determine which combination of techniques could be used to achieve certain output or plan targets.

===Debate on the use of money===
In contrast to Neurath, [[Karl Kautsky]] argued that money would have to be utilized in a socialist economy. Kautsky states the fundamental difference between socialism and capitalism is not the absence of money in the former; rather, the important difference is in the ability for money to become capital under capitalism. In a socialist economy, there would be no incentive to use money as [[financial capital]], thus money would have a slightly different role in socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1924/labour/ch03_j.htm | title=The Economic Revolution | author=Karl Kautsky | year=1924 | work=The Labour Revolution | publisher=Ruskin House, 40 Museum Street, W.C.1. | accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor-time calculation===
[[Jan Appel]] drafted a contribution to the Socialist calculation debate, which then went through a discussion process before being published as ''Foundations of Communist Production and Distribution'' by the [[General Workers' Union of Germany|Kommunistische Arbeiter-Union Deutschlands]] in 1930. An English translation by Mike Baker was published in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interwar debate==

===Economic calculation problem===
{{Main|Economic calculation problem}}
{{quotation|Every step that takes us away from private ownership of the means of production and from the use of money also takes us away from rational economics. —Ludwig von Mises, Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth&lt;ref&gt;''Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ludwig von Mises' argument against socialism was in response to Otto Neurath. Mises argued that money and market-determined prices for the means of production were essential in order to make rational decisions regarding their allocation and use.&lt;ref name="Calculation in-Natura, from Neurath to Kantorovich p. 9"&gt;''Calculation in-Natura, from Neurath to Kantorovich'', Cockshott, Paul. (p. 9): "Mises was initially debating against Otto Neurath. In an article dated 1919 Neurath had argued that a socialist economy would be able to operate calculations in-natura rather than by means of money."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms of the calculation problem===
[[Bryan Caplan]], an anarcho-capitalist economist, has criticized the version of the calculation problem advanced by Mises arguing that the lack of economic calculation makes socialism impossible (not merely inefficient).
Caplan recognizes that socialism makes economic calculation impossible, yet that problem may not be severe enough to make socialism impossible ("beyond the realm of possibility").

For instance, he points out that the fall of the Soviet Union does not prove that calculation was the main issue there. More likely the problems resulted from bad incentives arising out of the [[One-party state|one-party political system]] and degree of power granted to the party-elite.&lt;ref name="Is socialism really 'impossible'?, 2004"&gt;''Is socialism really "impossible"?'', by Caplan, Bryan. 2004. Critical Review, vol. 16, pp. 33–52, January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The knowledge problem===
{{quotation|''&lt;small&gt;"If a universal mind existed, of the kind that projected itself into the scientific fancy of Laplace – a mind that could register simultaneously all the processes of nature and society, that could measure the dynamics of their motion, that could forecast the results of their inter-reactions – such a mind, of course, could a priori draw up a faultless and exhaustive economic plan, beginning with the number of acres of wheat down to the last button for a vest. The bureaucracy often imagines that just such a mind is at its disposal; that is why it so easily frees itself from the control of the market and of Soviet democracy. But, in reality, the bureaucracy errs frightfully in its estimate of its spiritual resources...The innumerable living participants in the economy, state and private, collective and individual, must serve notice of their needs and of their relative strength not only through the statistical determinations of plan commissions but by the direct pressure of supply and demand."&lt;/small&gt;'' -Leon Trotsky, The Soviet Economy in Danger&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1932/10/sovecon.htm | title=The Soviet Economy in Danger | author=Leon Trotsky | date=October 1932 | work= | publisher=Marxism.org | accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Lange model===
[[Oskar Lange]] responded to Mises' assertion that socialism and social ownership of the means of production implied that rational calculation was impossible by outlining a model of socialism based on neoclassical economics. Lange conceded that calculations would have to be done in value terms rather than using purely natural or engineering criteria, but asserted that these values could be attained without capital markets and private ownership of the means of production. In Lange's view, this model qualified as socialist because the means of production would be publicly owned with returns to the public enterprises accruing to society as a whole in a [[social dividend]], while worker's self-management could be introduced in the public enterprises.&lt;ref name="Revisiting the Socialist Calculation Debate"&gt;''Revisiting the Socialist Calculation Debate: The role of markets and finance in Hayek's response to Lange's challenge'', by Auerbach, Paul and Sotiropoulos, Dimitris. 2012. Kingston University London, Economics Discussion Paper 2012-6, pp. 1–2: "Lange took up the challenge of Mises’ claim of the impossibility of constructing a socialist economy. He readily acceded to the need for efficiency calculations to be made in value terms rather than using purely natural or engineering criteria, but claimed that these values could emerge along lines consistent with neoclassical value theory, without the need for a market in capital goods and without private ownership over the means of production. Lange drew heavily upon the dominant neoclassical tradition to defend socialism"&lt;/ref&gt;

This model came to be referred to as the ''[[Lange model]]''. In this model, a Central Planning Board (CPB) would be responsible for setting prices through a trial-and-error approach to establish equilibrium prices, effectively running a [[Walrasian auction]]. Managers of the state-owned firms would be instructed to set prices to equal marginal cost (P=MC), so that economic equilibrium and [[Pareto efficiency]] would be achieved. The Lange model was expanded upon by [[Abba Lerner]] and became known as the Lange-Lerner theorem.

Paul Auerbach and Dimitris Sotiropoulos have criticized the Lange model for degrading the definition of socialism to a form of "capitalism without capital markets" attempting to replicate capitalism's efficiency achievements through economic planning. Auerbach and Sotiropoulos argue that Hayek provided an analysis of the dynamics of capitalism that is more consistent with [[Marxian economics|Marxian analysis]] because Hayek viewed finance as a fundamental aspect of capitalism and any move (through collective ownership or policy reform) to undermine the role of capital markets would threaten the integrity of the capitalist system. According to Auerbach and Sotiropoulos, Hayek gives an unexpected endorsement to socialism that is more sophisticated than Lange's superficial defense of "socialism".&lt;ref name="Revisiting the Socialist Calculation Debate2"&gt;''Revisiting the Socialist Calculation Debate: The role of markets and finance in Hayek's response to Lange's challenge'', by Auerbach, Paul and Sotiropoulos, Dimitris. 2012. Kingston University London, Economics Discussion Paper 2012-6, pp. 2–3: "Hayek implicitly realized the danger of undermining functional capitalist behaviour and therefore the nature of capitalist relations. If we see economic behaviour in capitalism as the outcome of capitalist social relations of power, then Hayek’s perspective renders capital markets as a central arena in the organization of capitalism as a system of exploitation. He also perceives every movement towards collective ownership of the means of production as a real threat to the reproduction of the logic of capitalism. In this sense, he implicitly ends up giving an unexpected endorsement to socialism that is much deeper and sophisticated than the superficial ‘defence’ of Lange."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary contributions==

=== Networked digital feedback ===
[[Peter Joseph]] argues for a transition from fragmented economic data relay to [[Internet of things|fully integrated, sensor-based digital systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Human Rights Movement: Reinventing The Economy to End Oppression|last=Joseph|first=Peter|publisher=BenBella Books, Inc.|year=2017|isbn=9781942952657|location=Dallas, TX|pages=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using an internet of sensory instruments to measure, track, and feed back information, this can unify numerous disparate elements and systems, greatly advancing awareness and efficiency potentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Human Rights Movement: Reinventing The Economy to End Oppression|last=Peter|first=Joseph|publisher=BenBella Books, Inc.|year=2017|isbn=9781942952657|location=Dallas, TX|pages=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an economic context, this approach could relay and connect data regarding how best to manage resources, production processes, distribution, consumption, recycling, waste disposal behavior, consumer demand, and so on. Such a process of networked economic feedback would work on the same principle as modern systems of inventory and distribution found in major commercial warehouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/uses-computers-inventory-control-2239.html|title=The Uses of Computers in Inventory Control|last=Davidson|first=Ellis|date=2010|website=Chron.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/keep-track-computer-inventory-18293.html|title=How to Keep Track of Computer Inventory|last=Applegate|first=Mark|date=|website=Chron.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies today use a range of sensors and sophisticated tracking means to understand rates of demands, exactly what they have, where it is or where it may be moving, and when it is gone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.skubana.com/walmart-leading-way/|title=WalMart: Leading the way with a successful supply chain management system|last=Rubin|first=Chad|date=February 14, 2018|website=Skubana.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/amazon-supply-chain-management/|title=6 Ways Amazon Is Changing Supply Chain Management in 2016|last=Burnson|first=Forrest|date=2016|website=Software Advice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.supplychaindigital.com/scm/supply-chain-40-adidas-and-amazon-re-write-rules-supply-chain-management|title=Supply Chain 4.0:  Adidas and Amazon re-write the rules on supply chain management|last=Benton|first=Dale|date=February 10, 2017|website=Supply Chain Digital}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is ultimately an issue of detail and scalability to extend this kind of awareness to all sectors of the economy, macro and micro.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Human Rights Movement: Reinventing The Economy to End Oppression|last=Joseph|first=Peter|publisher=BenBella Books, Inc.|year=2017|isbn=9781942952657|location=Dallas, TX|pages=280-281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only is price no longer needed to gain critical economic feedback, but the information price communicates is long delayed and incomplete in terms of economic measures required to dramatically increase efficiency. Mechanisms related networked digital feedback systems make it possible to efficiently monitor shifting consumer preference, demand, supply, and labor value, virtually in real time. Moreover, it can also be used to observe other technical processes price cannot, such as shifts in production protocols, allocation, recycling means, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Human Rights Movement: Reinventing The Economy to End Oppression|last=Joseph|first=Peter|publisher=BenBella Books, Inc.|year=2017|isbn=9781942952657|location=Dallas, TX|pages=280-281}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of February 2018, it is now possible to track trillions of economic interactions related to the supply chain and consumer behavior by way of sensors and digital relay, as seen with the advent of [[Amazon Go]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/21/inside-amazons-surveillance-powered-no-checkout-convenience-store/|title=Inside Amazon’s surveillance-powered, no-checkout convenience store|last=Coldewey|first=Devin|date=Jan 21, 2018|website=Tech Crunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cybernetic coordination===
[[Paul Cockshott]] and [[Allin Cottrell]], and Andy Pollack have proposed new forms of coordination based on modern information technology for non-market socialism. They argue that economic planning in terms of physical units without any reference to money or prices is computationally tractable given the high-performance computers available for particle physics and weather forecasting. Cybernetic planning would involve an ''a priori'' simulation of the equilibration process that idealized markets are intended to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/socialism_book/new_socialism.pdf|title=Towards A New Socialism|last=Cockshott|first=Paul|last2=Cottrell|first2=Allin|publisher=Russell Press|year=1993|isbn=0851245455|location=|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Participatory economics===
Proposals for decentralized economic planning emerged in the late 20th century in the form of [[participatory economics]] and negotiated coordination.{{attribution needed|date=December 2013}}

===Decentralized pricing without markets===
[[David McMullen]] argues that social ownership of the means of production and the absence of markets for them is fully compatible with a decentralized price system. In a post-capitalist society, transactions between enterprises would entail transfers of social property between custodians rather than an exchange of ownership. Individuals would be motivated by the satisfaction from work and the desire to contribute to good economic outcomes rather than material reward. Bids and offer prices would aim to minimize costs and ensure that output is guided by expected final demand for private and collective consumption. Enterprises and startups would receive their investment funding from project assessment agencies. The required change in human behavior would take a number generations and would have to overcome considerable resistance. However, McMullen believes that economic and cultural development increasingly favors the transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://economsoc.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/the-economic-case-for-social-ownership.pdf | title=The Economic Case for Social Ownership| author=David McMullen | year=2014 | work= Working Paper no. 1 | publisher= Post-Capitalism Project, April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://economsoc.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/re-opening-the-debates.pdf | title=Re-Opening the Debates on Economic Calculation and Motivation under Socialism| author=David McMullen | year=2014 | work= Working Paper no. 2 | publisher= Post-Capitalism Project, May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market socialism===
James Yunker argues that public ownership of the means of production can be achieved the same way private ownership is achieved in modern capitalism through the shareholder system that separates management from ownership. Yunker posits that social ownership can be achieved by having a public body, designated the Bureau of Public Ownership (BPO), owning the shares of publicly listed firms without affecting market-based allocation of capital inputs. Yunker termed this model ''Pragmatic market socialism'' and argued that it would be at least as efficient as modern-day capitalism while providing superior social outcomes as public ownership of large and established enterprises would enable profits to be distributed among the entire population rather than going largely to a class of inheriting [[Economic rent|rentiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Yunker|first= James |title= Socialism Revised and Modernized: The Case for Pragmatic Market Socialism|publisher= Praeger|date=April 1992|isbn= 978-0275941345|pages = 29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanism design===
Beginning in the 1970s new insights into the socialist calculation debate emerged from [[mechanism design]] theory. According to mechanism design theorists, the debate between Hayek and Lange became a stalemate that lasted for forty years because neither side was speaking the same language as the other – partially because the appropriate language for discussing socialist calculation had not yet been invented. According to these theorists, what was needed was a better understanding of the informational problems that prevent coordination between people. By fusing game theory with information economics, mechanism design provided the language and framework in which both socialists and advocates of capitalism could compare the merits of their arguments. As Palda (2013) writes in his summary of the contributions of mechanism design to the socialist calculation debate, “It seemed that socialism and capitalism were good at different things. Socialism suffered from cheating, or 'moral hazard', more than capitalism because it did not allow company managers to own shares in their own companies... The flip side of the cheating problem in socialism is the lying or 'adverse selection' problem in capitalism. If potential firm managers are either good or bad, but telling them apart is difficult, bad prospects will lie to become a part of the firm.”&lt;ref&gt;Palda, Filip (2013) The Apprentice Economist: Seven Steps to Mastery. Cooper-Wolfling Press, {{ISBN|978-0-9877880-4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to neoclassical economics==
In his book ''Whither socialism?'', [[Joseph Stiglitz]] criticized models of market socialism from the era of the socialist calculation debate in the 1930s as part of a more general criticism of neoclassical [[general equilibrium theory]], proposing that market models be augmented with insights from [[information economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Stiglitz|first= Joseph |title= Whither Socialism?|publisher= The MIT Press|date=January 1996|isbn= 978-0262691826|page =|quote=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alec Nove]] and [[Janos Kornai]] held similar positions regarding economic equilibrium. Both Nove and Kornai argued that, because perfect equilibrium does not exist, a comprehensive economic plan for production cannot be formulated, making planning ineffective just as real-world market economies do not conform to the hypothetical state of perfect competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nove|first= Alec |title= The Economics of Feasible Socialism, Revisited|publisher= Routledge|year= 1991|month= |isbn= 978-0043350492|page = 216|quote=The point of all this is to stress that a perfect ‘socialist’ capital market is just as unimaginable as ‘rational’ investment under assumptions of neo-classical perfection.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''The Economics of Feasible Socialism'' Alec Nove outlined a solution involving a socialist economy consisting of a mixture of macro-economic planning with market-based coordination for enterprises, where large industries would be publicly owned and small- to medium-sized concerns would be organized as cooperatively owned enterprises.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1419">'''''The Road to Hell: The Ravaging Effects of Foreign Aid and International Charity''''', by [[Michael Maren]], is a book about [[the road to hell is paved with good intentions|good intentions gone awry]], in the realm of charitable assistance to [[Africa]]. The author argues that the international aid industry is a big business more concerned with winning its next big government contract than helping needy people. The focus of the book is [[Somalia]]. Among the organizations criticized are [[World Vision]], [[Save the Children]], [[Christian Children's Fund]], [[UNICEF]], [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]], [[Catholic Relief Services]], and [[USAID]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreemanonline.org/book-reviews/book-review-the-road-to-hell-by-michael-maren/#&lt;/ref&gt; The book argues that relief aid helped bolster the regime of [[Siad Barre]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldhunger.org/articles/books/maren.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been cited by some academics as evidence that violent competition for control over large-scale food aid contributed to the breakdown of government in Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Does foreign aid promote democracy?|author=S Knack|publisher=International Studies Quarterly|year=2004|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118754276/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Singing Senators''' were a group of U.S. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|Senators]] who sang as a [[Barbershop music|barbershop]] quartet.

== Members ==
Representation as of 2000:

* Fmr. Sen. [[John Ashcroft]] (R-Missouri) – [[Baritone]]
* Fmr. Sen. [[Larry Craig]] (R-Idaho) – [[Singer#Lead and backing vocalists|Lead]]
* Fmr. Sen. [[James Jeffords]] (R-Vermont 1989-2001) (I-Vermont 2001-2007) – [[Tenor]]
* Fmr. Sen. [[Trent Lott]] (R-Mississippi) – [[Bass (voice type)|Bass]]

==History==

=== Beginnings ===
In 1995, at New Hampshire Senator [[Robert C. Smith|Bob Smith]]'s birthday party, Ashcroft, Jeffords, Lott, and [[Connie Mack III|Connie Mack]] of Florida sang "Happy Birthday". Later, when Senator [[Bob Packwood]] of [[Oregon]] was having a birthday party, Jeffords called Lott and suggested that the four of them sing at the party. Mack declined, but Larry Craig joined. According to his autobiography, ''[[Herding Cats, A Life in Politics]]'', Lott formed the group in large part to improve relations between the Republican Conference, of which Lott was Majority Leader, and Jeffords, a Republican who frequently voted with the Democrats.

During the initial years, the four Senators usually practiced in Lott's hideaway office.  [[Guy Hovis]], the Mississippi state director for Lott, was a talented musician who gave the Senators some training. They all practiced together every day.

=== 1995–2000 ===
Their first official performance of the group was in October 1995 at a Young Political Leaders of America meeting.&lt;ref name="Fed"&gt;Amy Phillips, [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/thefed/v3/volume18/8/singingsenators.shtml "The Singing Senators: Behind the 'Music'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007155914/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/thefed/v3/volume18/8/singingsenators.shtml |date=2006-10-07 }}, ''The Fed'', volume 18, issue 8, April 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1995, the group appeared on [[Today (NBC program)|''The Today Show'']].&lt;ref name="ORB"/&gt;

In April 1996, the [[Oak Ridge Boys]] sang with the group at a Senate reception,&lt;ref name="ORB"&gt;[http://www.oakridgeboys.com/Pages/senators_branson.html One Fabulous Sing-a-Long"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022183709/http://www.oakridgeboys.com/Pages/senators_branson.html |date=2006-10-22 }}, Oak Ridge Boys website, accessed June 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; something described in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', a Capitol Hill newspaper, as "Congressional Harmony". In September 1996 the group performed again with the Oak Ridge Boys in [[Branson, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="ORB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oakridgeboys.com/Pages/senators.html Press release] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035649/http://www.oakridgeboys.com/Pages/senators.html |date=2007-09-28 }}, Oak Ridge Boys, accessed June 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, the senators sang at the [[1996 Republican National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sigmanu.org/publications/thedelta/vol_114c.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623152303/http://www.sigmanu.org/publications/thedelta/vol_114c.asp |archivedate=2006-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the group released their only album, ''Let Freedom Sing'',  a ten-song CD recorded in Nashville.&lt;ref name="Fed"/&gt; In 2000, clips of the group's songs could be streamed from the Senate pages of Ashcroft and Jeffords.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Dean, [https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2000/04/35525 "They Put the Party in GOP"], ''Wired'', April 19, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2000, Ashcroft lost his [[U.S. Senate election, 2000|Senate re-election race]] (he was appointed [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] in early 2001).  In May 2001, Jeffords announced he was leaving the Republican Party to become an [[independent (politician)|Independent]], returning control of the Senate to the Democrats.  The two events, combined, led to the apparent demise of the group.&lt;ref name="Fed"/&gt;

=== Revival ===
In October 2006, Singing Senators Lott and Craig said they were putting the quartet back together after a six-year hiatus. They said they had found two solid prospects in Senators [[Robert Foster Bennett|Bob Bennett]] (R-Utah) and [[John Thune]] (R-S.D.)&lt;ref&gt;Emily Heil, [http://thehill.com/under-the-dome/hasterts-great-listening-skills-2006-10-11.html "Under the Dome: American Idol,  Senate style"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908000614/http://thehill.com/under-the-dome/hasterts-great-listening-skills-2006-10-11.html |date=2008-09-08 }}, ''The Hill'', October 11, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, Singing Senators Ashcroft, Craig, and Lott gave their first public performance in more than six years. Senator Craig was subsequently inducted into the Idaho Hall of Fame, having been selected in March 2007. Craig said that the group was now a [[trio (music)|trio]].&lt;ref&gt;Amy Argetsinger and Roxanne Roberts, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/13/AR2007061302469.html "A Homegrown Talent Returns for a Premiere"], ''Washington Post'', June 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Lott's announced resignation in 2007 seemed to put the existence of even a trio in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/27/AR2007112702382.html Al Kamen - Without Lott, the Singing Senators Are of One Voice - washingtonpost.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Craig's decision to not run for another term in 2008—due in part to the controversy over his [[Larry Craig#2007 arrest and consequences|arrest for solicitation]] the previous year—spelled the formal end of the group.

==Other singing legislators==
* [[Orrin Hatch]] (R-Utah), a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], is also a [[religious music]] artist. During 2002 he earned $18,009 in income from sales of his own recordings, according to a Senate financial disclosure; this was his highest annual intake from his singing.&lt;ref&gt;http://my.aol.com/news/news_story.psp?type=4&amp;cat=0800&amp;id=03061119382482745&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Second Amendments]], made up of five Congressmen from the [[U.S. House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].
* [[MP4 (band)|MP4]], who are a British rock group comprising 4 UK politicians (3 serving Members of Parliament and 1 former Member of Parliament).

The '''Third Way''' is a former political party and now a think tank that researches and debates themes relevant to nationalists. It was founded as a political party on 17 March 1990.  

According to accounts filed with the Electoral Commission, in 2006, Third Way had 20 members and cashflow of approximately £1,400.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20060330120000/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/files/dms/ThirdWay_17161-12597__E__N__S__W__.pdf Accounts of Third Way on Electoral Commission website]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, the membership was 21.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/party-finance/database-of-registers/statements-of-accounts/soa/pdfs/soa_25-05-11_15-06-35.pdf 2010 Party accounts on Electoral Commission website]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It decided to revert to being a think tank and de-registered as a political party.

It should not be confused with the [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] ideology promoted by [[Tony Blair]], [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Gerhard Schröder]], which it condemns as a revised form of social democracy.&lt;ref&gt;"The Third Way an Answer to Blair" by Patrick Harrington (UK {{ISBN|0-9535077-0-X}}, US {{ISBN|0-9679707-0-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; It is not related to the Christian [[Third Way (magazine)|''Third Way'']] magazine.

==Ideology==
Third Way describes itself as representing:
:"a movement dedicated to creating a society based on Justice, Community and Individual freedom against one that is based on Greed, Globalisation and Tyranny.
:
:Third Way stands against all forms of social injustice, racism and religious bigotry. Third Way is for everyone.
:
:We act as a 'Think-Tank' for positive ideas and apart from this website also publishes a magazine 'Third Way' and occasional books and pamphlets. 
:
:We advocate Direct Democracy along Swiss lines using referenda and citizens' initiatives. We support small business and co-operative ownership."

==Leading members==
Leading members of the Third Way were previously in the [[British National Front|National Front]], voting to disband it in 1989:
*[[Patrick Harrington]], founder 
*[[David Kerr (Northern Irish politician)|David Kerr]], has stood for election as an [[Ulster Third Way]] candidate in Belfast
 	
Also mentioned on the biographies section of the Third Way website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thirdway.eu/biographic/ |title=Biographies |publisher=Third Way website |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203093806/http://thirdway.eu/biographic/ |archivedate=3 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; are Roy Kerridge and US-based [[racial segregation|racial-separatist]] rabbi [[Mayer Schiller]].

==Links==
Third Way supported the English Lobby, a pressure group and electoral coalition founded in 2004 that campaigns for the recognition of St George's Day and the creation of an English parliament.

Third Way supporters assisted in the foundation of the [[British National Party|BNP]]-linked [[Solidarity – The Union for British Workers]].

==Associated publications==
The Third Way has operated, or is closely associated with, various publications and websites, including:
* ''Ulster Nation'' magazine and website
* ''Counter-Culture'' magazine and website 
* ''Liverpool Newsletter'', a [[distributist]] publication formerly edited by Anthony Cooney and now published by Third Way.

==National Liberal party==
In 1999, new electoral organisation the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1999)|National Liberal Party]] was formed by Patrick Harrington and [[Graham Williamson]] and registered as '''National Liberal Party – The Third Way''' with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]]. It fought parliamentary elections in [[Hornchurch (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornchurch]] (in 2001 and 2005), [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]] (2001, as [[Ulster Third Way]]), [[Upminster (UK Parliament constituency)|Upminster]] (2005) and [[Eastleigh (UK Parliament constituency)|Eastleigh]] (2010) but obtained below 1% of the vote in each case.

In the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (United Kingdom)|2014 European elections]], the National Liberal Party stood with 8 candidates in the [[London (European Parliament constituency)|London constituency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electionleaflets.org/leaflets/8030/ |title=National Liberal Party leaflet |publisher=[[Unlock Democracy|Electionleaflets.org]] |date=12 May 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; gaining 6,736 votes.&lt;ref&gt;http://londoneuroelections.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tribalism''' is the state of being organized by, or advocating for, [[tribe]]s or tribal lifestyles. Human evolution has primarily occurred in small groups, as opposed to [[mass society|mass societies]], and humans naturally maintain a [[social network]]. In [[popular culture]], tribalism may also refer to a way of thinking or behaving in which people are loyal to their social group above all else,&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/tribalism?q=tribalism Definition of tribalism;  http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/tribalism "Tribalism"]. Macmillan Dictionary. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; or, [[pejorative|derogatorily]], a type of discrimination or animosity based upon group differences.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tribalism "Tribalism"]. Merriam-Webster Dictionary. 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "tribe" can be defined to mean an extended kin group or [[clan]] with a common ancestor, or can also be described as a group with shared interests, lifestyles and habits. The proverb "[[wikt:birds of a feather flock together|birds of a feather flock together]]" describes [[homophily]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' |first=Niall |last=Ferguson |quote=At the same time, birds of a feather flock together. Because of the phenomenon known as “homophily,” or attraction to similarity, social networks tend to form clusters of nodes with similar properties or attitudes. |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2017-08-15/false-prophecy-hyperconnection |title=The False Prophecy of Hyperconnection |date=August 15, 2017 |access-date=October 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the human tendency to form friendship networks with people of similar occupations, interests, habits.&lt;ref name=birds&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McPherson | first1 = M. | last2 = Smith-Lovin | first2 = L. | last3 = Cook | first3 = J. M. | year = 2001 | title = Birds of a Feather: Homophily in Social Networks | url = http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.415 | journal = Annual Review of Sociology | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 415–444 | doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.27.1.415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some tribes can be located in geographically proximate areas, like [[village]]s or [[Band society|bands]], though telecommunications enables groups of people to form [[Tribe (Internet)|digital tribes]] using tools like [[social networking websites]].

In terms of [[conformity]],&lt;ref&gt;Dictionary definitions of Tribalism:
* [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/tribalism?q=tribalism Definition of tribalism by Oxford dictionary]; 
* [http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/tribalism Definition of tribalism by Macmillan dictionary];
* [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tribalism Definition of tribalism by Merriam-Webster dictionary].&lt;/ref&gt;
tribalism has been defined as a "subjectivity" or "way of being" social frame in which  communities are bound socially beyond immediate birth ties by the dominance of various modalities of face-to-face and object integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul James (academic) |title=Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006 |year=2006 |publisher= Sage Publications |location=London|pages=325–326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ontologically, tribalism is oriented around the valences of analogy, genealogy and mythology. That means that customary tribes have their social foundations in some variation of these tribal orientations, while often taking on traditional practices (e.g. [[Abrahamic religions]] such as [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]]), and modern practices, including monetary exchange, mobile communications, and modern education.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul James (academic)|James, Paul]]; et al., ''[http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-8630-9780824836405.aspx Sustainable Communities, Sustainable Development]: Other Paths for Papua New Guinea'' (2012) [https://www.academia.edu/3230875/Sustainable_Communities_Sustainable_Development_Other_Paths_for_Papua_New_Guinea_author_with_Nadarajah_Stead_and_Have_University_of_Hawaii_Press_Honolulu_2012 pdf download]&lt;/ref&gt;

The social structure of a tribe can vary greatly from case to case, but the relatively small size of customary tribes makes social life in such of tribes usually involve a relatively undifferentiated role structure, with few significant political or economic distinctions between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Max Gluckman|editor1=Robert A. Manners|editor2=David Kaplan|title=Anthropological Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s1gRZA9N7QYC|year=2007|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-202-36133-8|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=s1gRZA9N7QYC 453–464]|chapter=Social beliefs and individual Thinking in Tribal Society |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=s1gRZA9N7QYC&amp;pg=PA453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tribalism implies the possession of a strong cultural or ethnic identity that separates one member of a group from the members of another group. Based on strong relations of proximity and kinship, members of a tribe tend to possess a strong feeling of identity. Objectively, for a customary tribal society to form there needs to be ongoing customary organization, enquiry and exchange. However, intense feelings of common identity can lead people to feel tribally connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kanakasena Dekā|author2=Kanakasena Ḍekā|title=Assam's Crisis: Myth &amp; Reality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W8-zUe6RpfUC|year=1993|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-7099-473-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=W8-zUe6RpfUC&amp;pg=PA90 90]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between these two definitions for ''tribalism'', objective and subjective, is an important one because while ''tribal societies'' have been pushed to the edges of the [[Western world]], ''tribalism'', by the second definition, is arguably undiminished. A few writers have postulated that the human brain is hard-wired towards tribalism by its evolutionary advantages, but that claim is usually linked to equating original questions of sociality with tribalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Erich Fromm|author2=Michael MacCoby|title=Social Character in a Mexican Village|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnXCf7iGXQUC|year=1970|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-56000-876-7|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vnXCf7iGXQUC&amp;pg=PR11 xi]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tribe often refers to itself using its own language's word for "people", and refers to other, neighboring tribes with various epithets. For example, the term "[[Inuit]]" translates to "people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karen Lowther|author2=Evan-Mor Educational Publishers|title=Native Americans: Grades 1–3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rks-jTuBlEAC|year=2003|publisher=Evan-Moor|isbn=978-1-55799-901-6|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rks–jTuBlEAC&amp;pg=PA14 14]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution ==
Tribalism has a very adaptive effect in [[human evolution]]. Humans are social animals and ill-equipped to live on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Isaacs|first=Harold Robert|title=Idols of the Tribe: Group Identity and Political Change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Kne87aU7D0C|year=1975|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-44315-0|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0Kne87aU7D0C&amp;pg=PA43 43]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribalism and social bonding help to keep individuals committed to the group, even when personal relations may fray. That keeps individuals from wandering off or joining other groups. It also leads to [[bullying]] when a tribal member is unwilling to conform to the politics of the collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenks|first=Chris|title=Core Sociological Dichotomies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E8BPfIuAeSQC|year=1998|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=978-1-4462-6463-8|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=E8BPfIuAeSQC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;dq=tribalism+bonding 339]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars argue that [[inclusive fitness in humans]] involves [[kin selection]] and kin altruism, in which groups of an extended family with shared genes help others with similar genes, based on their [[coefficient of relationship]] (the amount of genes they have in common). Other scholars argue that [[fictive kinship]] is common in human organizations, allowing non-kin members to collaborate in groups like [[Fraternity|fraternities]].

Socially, divisions between groups fosters specialized interactions with others, based on association: altruism (positive interactions with unrelated members), kin-selectivity (positive interactions with related members) and violence (negative interactions). Thus, groups with a strong sense of unity and identity can benefit from [[kin selection]] behaviour such as common property and shared resources. The tendencies of members to unite against an outside tribe and the ability to act violently and prejudicially against that outside tribe likely boosted the chances of survival in genocidal conflicts.

Modern examples of tribal [[genocide]] rarely reflect the defining characteristics of tribes existing prior to the [[Neolithic Revolution]]; for example, small population and close-relatedness.

According to a study by [[Robin Dunbar]] at the [[University of Liverpool]], primate brain size is determined by social group size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Robin Dunbar|Dunbar, Robin I. M.]] |title=How many friends does one person need?: Dunbar's number and other evolutionary quirks |publisher=Faber and Faber |location=London |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-571-25342-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunbar's conclusion was that most human brains can really understand only an average of 150 individuals as fully developed, complex [[person|people]]. That is known as [[Dunbar's number]]. In contrast, anthropologist H. Russell Bernard and [[Peter Killworth]] have done a variety of field studies in the United States that came up with an estimated mean number of ties, 290, roughly double Dunbar's estimate. The Bernard–Killworth [[median]] of 231 is lower because of upward straggle in the distribution, but it is still appreciably larger than Dunbar's estimate.&lt;ref name="TwoMethods"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCarty |first=C. |last2=Killworth |first2=P. D. |last3=Bernard |first3=H. R. |last4=Johnsen |first4=E. |last5=Shelley |first5=G. |title=Comparing Two Methods for Estimating Network Size |journal=Human Organization |volume=60 |issue=1 |pages=28–39 |year=2000 |doi= 10.17730/humo.60.1.efx5t9gjtgmga73y|url=https://www.bebr.ufl.edu/sites/default/files/Comparing%20Two%20Methods%20for%20Estimating%20Network%20Size_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Russell Bernard. [http://nersp.osg.ufl.edu/~ufruss/ "Honoring Peter Killworth's contribution to social network theory."] Paper presented to the University of Southampton, 28 September 2006. &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malcolm Gladwell]] expanded on this conclusion sociologically in his book, ''[[The Tipping Point (book)|The Tipping Point]]'', where members of one of his types, ''Connectors'', were successful by their larger-than-average number of close friendships and capacity for maintaining them, which tie together otherwise-unconnected social groups. According to such studies, then, "tribalism" is in some sense an inescapable fact of human neurology simply because many human brains are not adapted to working with large populations. Once a person's limit for connection is reached, the human brain must resort to some combination of hierarchical schemes, [[stereotype]]s and other simplified models to understand so many people.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

== Violence ==
[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] engage in ongoing debate on the phenomenon of [[war]]fare among tribes. While fighting typically and certainly occurs among [[horticultural]] tribes, an open question remains whether such warfare is a typical feature of hunter-gatherer life or is an anomaly found only in certain circumstances, such as scarce resources (as with the Inuit or [[Arabs]]) or only among food-producing societies.&lt;ref name="WarBefore"&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas P. Fry|title=Beyond War: The Human Potential for Peace|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kPsTTYEl86kC |year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530948-5|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=kPsTTYEl86kC&amp;pg=PA114 114–115]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence H. Keeley|title=War Before Civilization|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SlXBOWFhvj8C |year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-988070-6|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SlXBOWFhvj8C&amp;pg=PA15 15–16]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also ample evidence that the level of violence among tribal societies is greater than the levels of violence among Western and European societies.&lt;ref name="BetterAngels"&gt;{{Cite Book|last=Parker|first=Steven|title=The Better Angels of Our Nature|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=9780143122012|date=September 25, 2012|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tribes use forms of subsistence such as [[horticulture]] and [[foraging]] that cannot yield the same number of absolute calories as [[agriculture]]. That limits tribal populations significantly, especially when compared to agricultural populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kumar Suresh Singh|title=Economies of the tribes and their transformation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qaAtAAAAMAAJ|year=1982|publisher = Concept |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?ei=qhOKT7ThAazNmQXYpbTjCQ&amp;id=qaAtAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22population+size%22+tribal+nutrition&amp;q=%22subsistence+economy%22+%22population+size%22#search_anchor 22]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence Keeley writes in ''[[War Before Civilization]]'' that examples exist with low percentage rates of casualties in tribal battle, and some tribal battles were much more lethal as a percentage of population than, for example, the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. He concludes that no evidence consistently indicates that primitive battles are proportionately less lethal than "civilized" ones.&lt;ref name=WarBefore /&gt;

The [[realistic conflict theory]] is a model of [[group conflict|intergroup conflict]], arguing that in a real or perceived [[Zero-sum game|zero-sum system]], conflicts arise over shared interests for finite resources. The 1954 Robbers Cave Experiment involved researchers putting 12-year old boys into groups, where they formed their own [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroups]], before then developing hostility and negativity towards the other group during simulated conflict over finite resources in a zero-sum game.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Bemeriki's style of presenting was representative of RTLM's overall hateful rhetoric, used alongside a colloquial type of tongue-in-cheek humor. On April 8, 1994, two days after the [[Assassination of Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|assassination]] of [[Juvénal Habyarimana|Rwandan president Juvénal Habyarimana]], Bemeriki ironically noted on air that opposition members of the previous government "could not be found",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Melvern |first=Linda |authorlink= |title=Conspiracy to Murder: The Rwandan Genocide |url= |year=2006 |publisher=Verso Books |location=London, UK |isbn=1844675424 |page=175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while several, such as [[Prime Minister of Rwanda|prime minister]] [[Agathe Uwilingiyimana]] had already been murdered. Based on an encounter at an interview at the offices of RTLM, [[Roméo Dallaire]], the Force Commander of [[UNAMIR]], has described Bemeriki as "very aggressive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dallaire |first=Roméo |authorlink= |title=Shake Hands with the Devil. The Failure of Humanity in Rwanda |url= |accessdate= |year=2003 |publisher=Random House Canada |location= |isbn=978-0-679-31171-3  |page=349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 28, 1994, over a month after the interview, Bemeriki claimed on-air that "Dallaire is the basis of this war."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rwandafile.com/rtlm/pdf/rtlm0137.pdf] UN transcript; ICTR-99-52-T; June 28, 1994, P137B, pg.17&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Kantano Habimana]], Bemeriki was the announcer with the second most airtime, approximately 17% of all RTLM broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Allan (Ed.) |authorlink= |title=Kimani, Mary: RTLM: the Medium that Became a Tool for Mass Murder.

Following the genocide, Bemeriki was named&lt;ref name="newsday" /&gt; as one its 2,133 "planners, organizers, instigators, supervisors and leaders"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rwandaembassy.org/discover-rwanda/the-genocide-in-rwanda.html The Genocide in Rwanda: Rwanda Embassy, Washington, D.C., 08.

Bemeriki fled Kigali for her native [[Zaire]] in July 1994 &lt;ref name="hirondelle"/&gt; and was arrested in [[Minova]], near [[Bukavu]] in the (by then renamed) [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] on the 13th of June, 1999 by the [[Rwandan Defence Forces|Rwandan military]].&lt;ref name="hirondelle"&gt;{{cite news |author=WK/DO/FH |title=VALERIE BEMERIKI, ANCIENNE JOURNALISTE DE RTLM ARRETEE, RECONNAÎT LES FAITS QUI LUI SONT REPROCHES |url=http://www.hirondellenews.org/fr/tpirrwanda/169-justice/10619-valerie-bemeriki-ancienne-journaliste-de-rtlm-arretee-reconnait-les-faits-qui-lui-sont-reproches4434 |location = Kigali, Rwanda |work=Hirondelle |date=22 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trial 01"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Valerie Bemeriki|publisher=TRIAL (Swiss association against impunity)|url=http://www.trial-ch.org/en/resources/trial-watch/trial-watch/profiles/profile/867/action/show/controller/Profile/tab/fact.html|access-date=2013-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408225056/http://www.trial-ch.org/en/resources/trial-watch/trial-watch/profiles/profile/867/action/show/controller/Profile/tab/fact.html|archive-date=2013-04-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''La Vía Campesina''' (from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''la vía campesina'', the [[Peasant|campesino]] way, or the peasants' way) was founded in 1993 by farmers organizations from Europe, Latin America, Asia, North America, Central America and Africa. It describes itself as "an international movement which coordinates peasant organizations of small and middle-scale producers, agricultural workers, rural women, and indigenous communities from Asia, Africa, America, and Europe".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;"Global Small-Scale Farmers' Movement Developing New Trade Regimes", [[Food First]] ''News &amp; Views'', Volume 28, Number 97 Spring/Summer 2005, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a coalition of 182 organisations in 81 countries, advocating family-farm-based [[sustainable agriculture]] and was the group that coined the term "[[food sovereignty]]".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; La Vía Campesina has carried out a campaign to defend farmer's seeds, a campaign to stop violence against women, a campaign for the recognition of the rights of peasants, a global campaign for [[agrarian reform]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Borras Jr., Saturnino M. "La Vía Campesina and its Global Campaign for Agrarian Reform.." ''Journal of Agrarian Change'' 8, no. 2/3 (April 2008): 258-289.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Ideology ===
Starting in the 1980s governments were intervening less in the rural countryside, which weakened corporate control over peasants' organizations while making a living in agriculture was getting more difficult.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = La Vía Campesina: the birth and evolution of a transnational social movement|last = Martínez-Torres|first = María Elena|date = 2010|journal = The Journal of Peasant Studies|doi = 10.1080/03066150903498804|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Rosset|first2 = Peter |volume=37 |pages=149–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, national peasant groups began to form ties with transnational organizations, starting in Latin America and then on a global scale.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The peasants' rights movement emerged from the [[Human rights movement#Since the 1990s|new rights advocacy]] which had arisen in the 1990s; during that time, human rights and development agendas became integrated which expanded from political and civil rights to include social and economic rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The agrarian peasants' movement moved to challenge the hegemonic ideology of [[neoliberalism]] in global economics and to find alternatives that would protect the rights of workers around the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shawki | first1 = Noha | year = 2014 | title = New Rights Advocacy and the Human Rights of Peasants: La Via Campesina and the Evolution of New Human Rights Norms | url = | journal = Journal of Human Rights Practice | volume = 6 | issue = 2| page = 311 | doi = 10.1093/jhuman/huu009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relation to international entities ===
The organization was founded in 1993 by farmers organizations from Europe, Latin America, Asia, North America, Central America and Africa.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The foundation followed the Uruguay Round of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), where the [[World Trade Organization]]'s [[Agreement on Agriculture]] and the [[Trade-related Intellectual Property Rights|Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights]] were signed and approved.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Via Campesina: Peasant Women on the Frontiers of Food Sovereignty|last = Desmarais|first = Annette Aurélie|date = 2003|journal = Canadian Woman Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 23|issue = 1|pages = 140–145|issn = 0713-3235}}&lt;/ref&gt; These agreements caused backlash from many people around the world for focusing on technical problems rather than the human right to access to food, especially for those living in the Global South.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Worlds apart: The WTO’s Agreement on Agriculture and the right to food in developing countries|last = Hawkes|first = Shona|date = 2013|journal = International Political Science Review|doi = 10.1177/0192512112445238|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Plahe|first2 = Jagjit Kaur|volume = 34|issue = 1|pages = 21–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globalization was under way at this time, affecting many industries including agriculture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; La Vía Campesina gave small farmers a platform to have their voices heard about how these changes were impacting their lives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The movement has grown and is now recognized as a part of the global dialogue on food and agriculture, having presented to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] and the [[UN Human Rights Council]] in the past.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;La Via Campesina: International Peasant's Movement. Organisation. Published 9 Feb. 2011. Retrieved from &lt;http://viacampesina.org/en/index.php/organisation-mainmenu-44&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Priorities ===
According to La Via Campesina's webpage, the movements main issues are promoting food sovereignty; demanding agrarian reform; people's control over land, water, territories; resisting free-trade; promoting popular peasant feminism;upholding human rights, rights of migrant workers; promoting agroecology; promoting peasant seeds systems; increasing the participation of youth in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About La Via Campesina|url=https://viacampesina.org/en/la-via-campesina-organisational-brochure-edition-2016/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the movement has placed greater emphasis on gender issues and women's rights, and strengthened its opposition to [[transnational corporations]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It has also focused on gaining recognition for the discourse around food sovereignty, reclaiming the term "peasant" and recreating a shared peasant identity across national borders and cultures.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; La Vía Campesina also partners with other social movements and [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) to strengthen its international presence.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The power of peasants: Reflections on the meanings of La Vía Campesina|last = Desmarais|first = Annette Aurélie|date = 2008|journal = Journal of Rural Studies|doi = 10.1016/j.jrurstud.2007.12.002|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 24|issue = 2|pages = 138–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic decision-making is central to the mission of La Vía Campesina, and it has been dedicated to fair representation and engagement of all participants, making structural changes when necessary.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The perspectives of people around the world are needed to assess and improve global food production and sovereignty.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Part of this effort for equality among movement members is creating a shared peasant identity. The reclaiming of this identity has been called "re-peasantization".&lt;ref&gt;Welch, C., 2001. Peasants and globalization in Latin America: a survey of recent literature. Paper presented at the XXIII International Congress of the Latin American Studies Association, 6–8 September, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Desmarais (2008), the term "peasant" in English  has a connotation related to [[feudalism]], but in other languages and contexts, the meaning is broader; ''campesino'' comes from the word ''campo'', meaning "countryside", which ties the people to the land.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This feudalist connotation is one reason why the organization chose not to translate its name into English.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Awards ===
In November 2017, La Vía Campesina received the XV Navarra International Prize for Solidarity (Premio Internacional Navarra a la Solidaridad).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://viacampesina.org/en/la-via-campesina-xv-navarra-international-prize-for-solidarity/|title="Globalising the struggle also means globalising solidarity and hope" - La Via Campesina, while accepting the XV Navarra International Prize for Solidarity|date=2017-12-07|work=Via Campesina English|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, the autonomous, pluralist and multicultural movement, which is entirely independent from any political or economical affiliation, was awarded the Lush Spring Prize Influence Award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LVC|first1=Via Campesina|title=Lush Spring Prize Influence Award Winner: La Via Campesina|url=https://uk.lush.com/article/lush-spring-prize-influence-award-winner-la-campesina|website=uk.lush.com|publisher=Lush Spring Prize|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the organization received an award from the Latin American Scientific Society for Agroecology ([https://www.socla.co/en SOCLA]) "in recognition of its example of tireless struggle in favor of agroecology and the rights of peasants, in carrying out its mission to take care of the earth, feed the world, conserve biodiversity and cool the planet, through its constant search for food sovereignty in Latin America."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://viacampesina.org/en/index.php/main-issues-mainmenu-27/sustainable-peasants-agriculture-mainmenu-42/1879-la-via-campesina-receives-award-for-tireless-struggle-in-favor-of-agroecology|title = La Via Campesina receives award for "tireless struggle in favor of Agroecology"|date = 13 October 2015|accessdate = 20 November 2015|website = La Via Campesina: International Peasant's Movement|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, La Vía Campesina was awarded the International Human Rights Award by [[Global Exchange]], in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;Global Exchange Human Rights Awards. Past Honorees.

==Organization==

La Vía Campesina is a grassroots movement, with activism at the local and national level. Members come from 81 countries, organised into 9 regions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The International Coordinating Committee is represented by one man and one woman per region and one youth per continent, each elected by their respective region's member organisations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With about 182 local and national organisations as part of the movement, La Via Campesina represents an estimated 200 million farmers around the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to Menser (2008), La Via Campesina is an example of the success and expansion of transnational movements in regards to [[participatory democracy]] due to its organization model and adaptation to ensure fair representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Transnational Participatory Democracy in Action: The Case of La Via Campesina|last = Menser|first = Michael|date = 2008|journal = Journal of Social Philosophy|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9833.2007.00409.x|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 39|issue = 1|pages = 20–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meetings ===
Representatives from each region meet at International Conferences roughly every four years. Past meetings were held in [[Mons]] in 1993, [[Tlaxcala City]] in 1996, [[Bangalore]] in 2000, [[São Paulo]] in 2004, [[Maputo]] in 2008, [[Jakarta]] in 2013, and [[Derio]] in 2017.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;La Via Campesina: International Peasant's Movement.

Past locations were Belgium (1993-1996), Honduras (1997-2004), and Indonesia (2005-2013).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Since September 2013, the secretariat has been in Harare, Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The current General Coordinator is Elizabeth Mpofu, who  focuses on violence against women, youth voices, and global seed freedom.&lt;ref&gt;La Via Campesina: International Peasant's Movement.

=== Women's involvement ===
Gender was ignored as a consideration at the start of the movement. At the signing of the Managua Declaration - the precursor to La Vía Campesina - all 8 people present were men.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Peasant women started to become more involved and pushing for women's rights at the International Conference in Tlaxcala in 1996.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; At this meeting, they decided to form a committee dedicated to women's rights and gender issues, which eventually became the Vía Campesina's Women's Commission.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The women on the committee were also heavily involved in editing the draft of the cornerstone position on food sovereignty that was presented at the World Food Summit in 1996.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; They included health as a consideration for food production without agro-chemicals, as well as the importance of women's involvement in policy changes because women typically were barred from political involvement.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The women of La Vía Campesina are still working for greater representation and engagement of peasant women, especially in leadership positions.

==Food sovereignty==
La Via Campesina introduced the right of [[food sovereignty]] at the World Food Summit in 1996 as "the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through sustainable methods and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The phrase "culturally appropriate" signifies that the food that is available and accessible for the population should fit with the cultural background of the people consuming it. For example, subsidised and imported wheat products would not fall under this category in a country where corn-based foods were the basis of traditional meals.

=== Food sovereignty vs. food security ===
Food sovereignty differs from [[food security]]. Food security was defined as "physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food... at all times to meet [the population's] dietary and food preferences for an active and healthy life" by D. Moyo at the American Society of International Law annual meeting in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;The Future of Food: Elements of Integrated Food Security Strategy for South Africa and Food Security Status in Africa, D. Moyo. Proceedings of the Annual Meeting (American Society of International Law). Vol. 101 (MARCH 28-31, 2007), pp. 103-108. {{jstor|25660167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food security is more focused on the provision of food for all by whatever means necessary, whether by local production or global imports. As a result, economic policies concerned with food security typically emphasize [[industrial farming]] that can produce more food cheaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Efficacy of a Program Promoting Rice Self-Sufficiency in Ghana during a Period of Neoliberalism|last = Glenna|first = Leland|date = 2012|journal = Rural Sociology|doi = 10.1111/j.1549-0831.2012.00088.x|pmid = |last2 = Ader|first2 = David|last3 = Bauchspies|first3 = Wenda|last4 = Traoré|first4 = Abou|last5 = Agboh-Noameshi|first5 = Rita Afiavi|volume=77|pages=520–546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedmann defines a [[Food regimes|food regime]] as a “rule governed structure of production and consumption of food on a world scale”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A food regime is marked by a period of transition in food production that results in significant social, political, and economic change.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The current situation of global food production can be called the "corporate food regime" due to the concentration of supplying and processing food in the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Alternative Agriculture Network Isan and Its Struggle for Food Sovereignty - a Food Regime Perspective of Agricultural Relations of Production in Northeast Thailand|last = Heis|first = Alexandria|date = 2015|journal = Austrian Journal of South-East Asian Studies|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 8|issue = 1|pages = 67–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, US corporations have control over food production by subcontracting smaller farmers, which allows them to participate and profit without taking on the risks of farming, such as weather and disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = International Agrarian Restructuring and the Practical Ethics of Peasant Movement Solidarity|last = Patel|first = Rajeev|date = 2006|journal = Journal of Asian and African Studies|doi = 10.1177/0021909606061748|pmid = |access-date =|volume=41|pages=71–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food regimes are the result of “political struggles among contending social groups” for control over how food production is framed and conceptualized, according to McMichael.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The corporate food regime came about with the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic theory which is motivated by efficiency and trade liberalization, and states that nations should focus their efforts and resources on producing goods and services where they have an advantage relative to other nations (that is, goods that they are best at producing), as cited by Philip McMichael.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McMichael | first1 = Philip | year = 2009 | title = A food regime genealogy | url = | journal = The Journal of Peasant Studies | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 139–169 | doi = 10.1080/03066150902820354 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The corporate food regime has existed for only the last 100 years, as compared to the millennia prior to [[industrialization]] and the [[Green Revolution]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This exchange differs from the [[Global Exchange of Military Information]] in that it is limited to forces in Europe, while the Global Exchange of Military Information applies to all forces of the participating states, wherever located.  The annual exchange of information was conducted concurrently with the annual exchange of information under the [[Conventional Forces in Europe]] treaty, in [[Vienna|Vienna, Austria]] in December of each year.{{efn|Prior to that treaty becoming fully defunct as a result of events during 2014 / 2015.}}  The Vienna Document has been revised periodically, and the current version is the 2011 version.&lt;ref name=measures&gt;{{cite web|title=On Confidence and Security Building Measures|url=http://www.osce.org/fsc/86597|publisher=Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe|accessdate=10 August 2013|date=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2014 onwards there have been fears that the Vienna Document is on the verge of becoming [[de facto]] defunct, as other arms control and security agreements continue to collapse due to the [[2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|ongoing tensions]] in Eastern Europe.

The '''[[water conflict]] between Ethiopia and Kenya''' is a development dispute due to the receding water resource along the border between [[Ethiopia]] and [[Kenya]].

== Overview ==
Ethiopia decided to build the [[Gilgel Gibe&amp;nbsp;III Dam]] on the [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo River]] to provide [[hydropower]] electricity to Ethiopia as well as [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]], [[Djibouti]], Kenya, [[Uganda]] and [[Yemen]]. Considering rising temperatures, [[desertification]] and because the Omo is the main water source for several Ethiopian and Kenyan tribes, the dam could potentially cause violent conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesojournerproject.wordpress.com/2011/06/10/water-scarcity-and-conflict-at-the-ethiopia-kenya-border |title=Water Scarcity and Conflict at the Ethiopia-Kenya Border |publisher=The Sojourner Project |date=2011-06-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710071011/https://thesojournerproject.wordpress.com/2011/06/10/water-scarcity-and-conflict-at-the-ethiopia-kenya-border|archivedate= 2011-07-10 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Aaron Wolf identified the problem's two major factors as:economic and population growth, and institutional capacity, or “human systems built to mitigate the change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/water-conflict-violence-erupts-along-ethiopias-and-kenyas-water-stressed-border |title=Water Conflict: Violence Erupts Along Ethiopia-Kenya Water-stressed Border &amp;#124; Circle of Blue WaterNews |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813010516/http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2011/world/water-conflict-violence-erupts-along-ethiopias-and-kenyas-water-stressed-border |archivedate=2011-08-13 |publisher=Circleofblue.org |date=2011-06-21 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the border area between Ethiopia and Kenya, The [[Turkana people|Turkana]] of Kenya and the [[Dassanech]], [[Nyangatom people|Nyangatom]] and [[Mursi people|Mursi]] of Ethiopia are tribes that depend on the Omo River and [[Lake Turkana]] to survive. In the past years the area became drier, with a hot climate and prolonged drought. Population growth aggravated the problem. The people live in a pastoral system, moving around wherever resources can be found. In years of scarcity conflicts happen almost every day.&lt;ref name=pulit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/africa/water-wars-ethiopia-and-kenya |title=Water Wars: Ethiopia and Kenya |publisher=Pulitzer Center |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pdn&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker |first=David |url=http://www.pdnonline.com/features/An-Under-Reported-Wa-1447.shtml |title=An Under-Reported War Over Water |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714151306/https://www.pdnonline.com/features/An-Under-Reported-Wa-1447.shtml |archivedate=2014-07-14 |publisher=Pdnonline.com |date=2011-01-26 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clp&gt;{{cite web|last=Stuteville |first=Sarah |url=http://clpmag.org/series.php?id=0 |title=Water Wars |website=Clpmag.org |publisher=Common Language Project |date=2009-01-01 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nation&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/Raila+accuses+military+of+letting+down+Kenyans+at+border+/-/1056/1165400/-/y8cimw/-/ |title=Raila accuses military of letting down Kenyans at border |publisher=nation.co.ke |date=2011-05-18 |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake Turkana receives 90 percent of its water from Omo River. Rising temperatures and reduced rainfall have contributed to the lake’s retreat into Kenya. To survive, the Ethiopians tribes began following the water. As a result, intertribal conflict is increasing.

As of 2005, at least four Ethiopians and 20 Kenyans had died, although some Kenyan government officials placed the toll as high as 69, according to the Kenya-based [[Daily Nation]]. The localized fighting pressured both nations to address the conflict.

According to John Nunyes, a member of [[Parliament of Kenya|Kenya’s parliament]], Ethiopians had moved {{cvt|15|km}} inside Kenya. “They have stopped our Turkana people from fishing, they have thrown us out of the pastures, we can’t access the waters. We allowed our communities to continue fighting and competing over resources”, he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Turner |first1=Angela |title=Climate change: Kenya |url=https://issuu.com/perspectivepublications/docs/issuu-preview_march_2016 |website=Issuu.com |accessdate=2018-10-13 |language=en |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, an estimated 900 armed militia and 2,500 Ethiopian civilians on Kenyan territory around lake Turkana increased attacks against Kenyans. The Kenyan government claimed that these illegal immigrants had taken control of 10 Kenyan villages and vowed to send them back to Ethiopia.

The dispute was driven both by territorial claims and access to water resources.&lt;ref name=pulit /&gt;&lt;ref name=pdn /&gt;&lt;ref name=nation /&gt;

== Tribes ==

=== Turkana people ===
The [[Turkana people|Turkana]] are frequently attacked by the Ethiopian tribes. In May 2011, a dozen Ethiopians allegedly killed Kenya‘s head of the [[Border Police]], John Nunyes, a [[Kenyan Parliament]] member who visited the Turkana community. Before dramatic [[climate]] changes, the area inhabited by the [[Turkana people]]enabled the sustainability of [[livestock]] herds. This was because of the area's predictable rainfall and availability of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waila|first=Jacinta|date=2018|title=Outcomes of Climate Change in a Marginalized Population: An Ethnography on the Turkana Pastoralists in Kenya|url=|journal=AJPH Perspectives|volume=108|pages=570|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many people are now migrating toward the Turkana’s territory and most Turkana tribesmen are suffering from the loss of pasture and access to water.

=== Daasanach people ===
The Daasanach share a traditional border with the Turkana. However, the border is moving toward south because of receding water. According to the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', the Daasanach have begun cultivating the land and fishing using the waters of the River Omo-Lake Turkana Delta in competition with the Kenyan Turkana people for both land and water resources.

=== Nyangatom people ===
The Nayangatom are cattle herders who use Omo River water for their animals. Those who are displaced internally rely on government and foreign support, which is not always well thought out. For example, the international community sent foods such as [[maize]], which cannot be eaten raw and requires a lot of water to cook.
