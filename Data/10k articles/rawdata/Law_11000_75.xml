'''Access to public information''' and '''[[freedom of information]] (FOI)''' refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information Freedom of Information, UNESCO. {{Retrieved|access-date=2016-10-16}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to public information is guaranteed by the Constitution of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] (Article 16). To implement this constitutional right, the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia in January 2006 adopted the Law on Free Access to Public Information defining the procedures for exercising this right. The Law has been significantly amended at the beginning of 2010.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu&gt;{{cite journal |author=Suzana Dzamtoska-Zdravkovska|date=2012 |title=Free Access to Public Information - More Transparency, Less Corruption: The case of Republic of Macedonia |url=https://www.academia.edu/3023686/Free_Access_to_Public_Information-More_Transparency_Less_Corruption_The_Case_of_Republic_of_Macedonia |publisher=eprints.ugd.edu.mk |issue= |access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a research carried out by the [[Centre for Law and Democracy]], Macedonia is in the high 14th place on the world ranking list of states having the most functional law on free access to public information, despite the fact that this right has been introduced into Macedonian legal system in a relatively recent period.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt; However, according to the [[European Commission]], the implementation of the Law on Free Access to Public Information remains ineffective.&lt;ref name="EC2015" /&gt;

==FOI provisions under the law==

The '''Law on Free Access to Information''' stresses the obligation of the institutions to provide information with precise deadlines: it allows individuals and legal entities to exercise their right of access to public information and obliges the holders of information to provide information to the public.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt;

The public authorities subject to the law are governmental institutions and other bodies and institutions set by law, municipal bodies, public institutions and services, public enterprises and natural persons and legal entities performing a public service.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt; In general, all information available to the public authorities holding the information is public.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt; Access to them may be refused in exceptional cases determined by law.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt;

The holders of information are obliged to keep records and to update the list of information in their disposal and to publish them in a manner available to the public. Also, they are obliged to provide premises for inspection of the requested information.&lt;ref name=sep.gov&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sep.gov.mk/en/content/?id=93#.WKsLx2_hCUl |title=Free access to information |last= |first= |date= |website=Sep.gov.mk |publisher=Government of the Republic of Macedonia. Secretariat for European Affairs |access-date=20 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All institutions subject to the law are required to appoint officials for handling access to information requests. They are the reference point for the citizens willing to exercise their right to access public information.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt; The holder of the information is obliged to inform the public on the official person responsible for mediating information. The appointed person for mediating information shall provide the necessary information, help the applicant and keep special records for receipt of the applications for information.&lt;ref name=sep.gov/&gt;

Applicants can submit the requests in writing or orally. Reviewing the documents at the institution's building is free of charge. Costs of photocopying, transcribing, translating or delivering the documents can be charged to the applicant.&lt;ref name=BIRN&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |title=Transparency in the Balkans and Moldova |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/file/show/Transparency-in-the-Balkans-and-Moldova.pdf |publisher=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN)|issue= |access-date= 20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decision on the request should be made within 30 days.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt; Access to information can be refused if it threatens national or public security; the economy; the environment; commercial or private legitimate interests; monetary and exchange policies; or if interferes with the prevention of criminal offences.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

The [[Commission for Protection of the Right to Free Access to Public Information]] (KOMSPI) is in charge for providing information to the citizens regarding access to information, monitoring the implementation of the  law and delivering regular annual reports on the application of the Law to the Parliament. Also, the Commission conducts seminars and trainings aiming at educating public officials in their duties to implement the access to public information law.&lt;ref name=Academia.edu/&gt; According to the 2015 [[European Commission]] Progress Report 2015 the Commission does not have sufficient capacity to monitor compliance with proactive disclosure of information, and has not the power to impose sanctions to better enforce the legislation.&lt;ref name=EC2015&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/neighbourhood-enlargement/sites/near/files/pdf/key_documents/2015/20151110_report_the_former_yugoslav_republic_of_macedonia.pdf |title=The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Report 2015 |last= |first= |date=10 November 2015 |website=ec.europa.eu |publisher=European Commission |access-date=20 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The applicant has the right to appeal against a refusal. The first complaint is to the Commission for Protection of the Right to Free Access to Public Information; in case the applicant is not satisfied with the decision, he/she can launch a judicial review.&lt;ref name=BIRN/&gt;

==Access to public information in practice==

Despite the good legal framework, the implementation of the Law on Free Access to Public Information remains ineffective.&lt;ref name=EC2015/&gt; Penalties are not imposed for failure to comply.&lt;ref name=EC2015/&gt; Political parties are excluded from the list of holders of information, thus they are outside the scope of the law.&lt;ref name=EC2015/&gt;

According to journalists, there is a tendency by public authorities to over-use the "classification" of documents to prevent public access to information.&lt;ref name=EC2015/&gt; According to [[Freedom House]], the law is unevenly and selectively enforced, with official denying responses and shunning independent or critical media outlets.&lt;ref name=FreedomHouse&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedominfo.org/2013/11/belief-in-access-rights-found-low-in-macedonian-survey/ |title=Belief in Access Rights Found Low in Macedonian Survey |last= |first= |date=21 November 2013 |website=freedominfo.org |publisher=Freedominfo.org. The global network of freedom of information advocates|access-date=20 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To monitor and test the implementation of the law, in 2012 the [[MYLA|Macedonian Young Lawyers Association]] (MYLA) submitted 145 requests for free access to information of public interest to a number of state institutions. More than two thirds of the information holders responded within the legal time limit and delivered the requested information.&lt;ref name=EDRI&gt;{{cite web |url=https://edri.org/edrigramnumber10-16macedonia-acces-to-public-information-study |title=Macedonia: Serious channelges for access to public information |date=29 August 2012 |website=edri.org |publisher=European Digital Rights|access-date=20 February 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some problems of implementation and difficulties emerged, such as the practice of redirecting the requests towards other state institutions, instead of delivering it.&lt;ref name=EDRI/&gt;

According to a survey conducted in 2013 by the [[Open Society Foundations|Foundation Open Society]] - Macedonia, a significant share of Macedonian citizens does not believe they are entitled to have the right of access to public information and request informations of public interest.&lt;ref name=FreedomHouse/&gt; According to the survey, more than half of citizens had never heard and were unaware of the Law on Free Access to Public Information; only 13% of them were well knowledgeable about the Law.&lt;ref name=FreedomHouse/&gt;

An '''Arbitration Committee''' is a [[Wikipedia:Arbitration/Active sanctions|binding]] [[dispute resolution]] panel of [[Wikipedia editor|editors]], used on several projects of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]]. The first project to use an arbitration committee, and the most widely covered of these, is the [[English Wikipedia]], the first project where such a structure was used, and this is the committee mainly covered in this article. Each of Wikimedia's projects are editorially autonomous and independent. Therefore, over time some other Wikimedia projects have established arbitration committees, while others have not. Arbitration committees, where they exist, are established by a project's editors, and are usually elected by their community in annual elections. As well as serious disputes, they often address misconduct by administrators, access to various  advanced tools, and a range of "[[reality|real world]]" issues related to harmful conduct, when these arise in the context of a Wikipedia project.

Arbitration committees generally have the authority to impose binding sanctions, and also to determine which users have access to special permissions.

The first such committee was created by [[Jimmy Wales]] on December 4, 2003, as an extension of the decision-making power he formerly held as owner of the site.&lt;ref name='Wales1'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://markmail.org/message/komcldyapats43xj#query:+page:1+mid:komcldyapats43xj+state:results |title= WikiEN-l Wikiquette committee appointments |accessdate=2009-06-09 |last=Wales |first=Jimmy |date=2003-12-04 |work=Wikipedia |publisher=[[Wikimedia Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='SSRN'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Wikitruth Through Wikiorder |journal=Emory Law Journal|year=2010|first=David A.|last=Hoffman|author2=Salil Mehra |volume=59|issue=2010|pages=|ssrn=1354424}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee acts as a [[court of last resort]] (described in the media variously as 'quasi-[[judiciary|judicial]]' or a Wikipedian 'High/[[Supreme court|Supreme Court]]', though the Committee states that it is not, nor pretends to be, a court of law in the formal sense) for disputes among editors. It has decided several hundred cases in its history.&lt;ref name='NYT-2009'&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/08/technology/internet/08link.html?hpw |title=The Wars of Words on Wikipedia’s Outskirts |accessdate=2009-06-09 |last=Cohen |first=Noam |date=2009-06-07 |work=The New York Times | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140328091528/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/08/technology/internet/08link.html?hpw| archivedate=March 28, 2014&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Committee are appointed by Wales either in person or email following advisory elections; Wales generally chooses to appoint arbitrators who were among those who received the most votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&amp;pg=PA208 | title=Wikipedia: The Missing Manual | publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] | author=Broughton, John | year=2008 | pages=208–209| isbn=9780596553777 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee has been examined by academics researching [[dispute resolution]], and also reported in public media in connection with various case decisions and Wikipedia-related controversies.&lt;ref name='SSRN'/&gt;&lt;ref name='NZ-2009'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10577178 |title=Wikipedia sentinel quits after 'sock-puppeting' scandal |accessdate=2009-06-09 |last=Welham |first=Jamie |author2=Nina Lakhan |date=2009-06-08 |work=The New Zealand Herald |publisher=APN Holdings NZ Limited }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='T-2009'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/wikipedia/5408761/Church-of-Scientology-members-banned-from-editing-Wikipedia.html |title=Church of Scientology members banned from editing Wikipedia |accessdate=2009-06-09 |last=Moore |first=Matthew |date=2009-05-30 |work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Ltd. | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090602104528/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/technology/wikipedia/5408761/Church-of-Scientology-members-banned-from-editing-Wikipedia.html| archivedate= 2 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In October 2003, as part of an etiquette discussion on Wikipedia, [[Alex Roshuk|Alex T. Roshuk]], then legal adviser to the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], drafted a 1,300 word outline of mediation and arbitration. This outline evolved into the twin Mediation Committee and Arbitration Committee, formally announced by Jimmy Wales on December 4, 2003.&lt;ref name='SSRN'/&gt;&lt;ref name='AR'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roshuklaw.com/ |title=Law office of Alex T.

When founded, the Committee consisted of 12 [[arbitrators]] divided into three groups of four members each.&lt;ref name='Wales1'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Fortune'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/31/magazines/fortune/mysql_greatteams_fortune/index.htm |title=Secrets of Greatness: Great Teams |accessdate=2009-06-15 |last=Hyatt |first=Josh |date=2006-06-01 |work=Fortune |publisher=Time Warner }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2008}}, it had decided around 371 conduct cases, with remedies varying from warnings to bans.&lt;ref name='CSM'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0105/p13s02-stct.html |title=Online Wikipedia is not Britannica - but it's close |accessdate=2009-06-15 |last=Lamb |first=Gregory M. |date=2006-01-05 |work=The Christian Science Monitor }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='S-2004'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2004/04/27/wikipedia |title=Everyone is an editor |accessdate=2009-06-09 |last=Williams |first=Sam |date=2004-04-27 |work=Salon.com |publisher=Salon Media Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=January 2018}}

==Attention and controversies==
A statistical study published in the ''[[Emory Law Journal]]'' in 2010 indicated that the Committee has generally adhered to the principles of ignoring the content of user disputes and focusing on user conduct.&lt;ref name='SSRN'/&gt;  The same study also found that despite every case being assessed on its own merits, a correlation emerged between the types of conduct found to have occurred and the remedies and decisions imposed by the Committee.

In 2007, an arbitrator using the username [[Essjay]] [[Essjay controversy#Timeline|resigned from the Committee]] after it was found that he had made false claims about his academic qualifications and professional experiences in a ''New York Times'' interview.&lt;ref name='NYT-E'&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/12/technology/12wiki.html?ex=1331352000&amp;en=668e67bce73bf6c6&amp;ei=5089&amp;partner=rssyahoo&amp;emc=rss |title=After False Claim, Wikipedia to Check Degrees |accessdate=2009-06-14 |last=Cohen |first=Noam |date=2007-03-12 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='NYT-2006'&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/17/technology/17wiki.html?scp=3&amp;sq=Arbitration%20Committee%20Wikipedia&amp;st=cse |title=Growing Wikipedia Refines Its 'Anyone Can Edit' Policy |accessdate=2009-06-09 |last=Hafner |first=Katie |date=2006-06-17 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='NYT-2007'&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/05/technology/05wikipedia.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Essjay&amp;st=cse |title=A Contributor to Wikipedia Has His Fictional Side |accessdate=2009-06-09 |last=Cohen |first=Noam |date=2007-03-05 |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2007, the committee banned [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] professor [[Carl Hewitt]] from editing the online encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/dec/09/wikipedia.internet | title=Wikipedia ban for disruptive professor | work=The Guardian | date=9 December 2007 | accessdate=3 December 2014 | author=Kleeman, Jenny}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, an arbitrator who edited under the username Sam Blacketer resigned from the Committee after it became known that he had concealed his past editing in obtaining the role.&lt;ref name='NZ-2009'/&gt;

In 2015, [[Criticism of Wikipedia#Allegations of biased treatment|the Committee received attention]] for its ruling pertaining to [[Gamergate controversy|Gamergate]], in which one editor was banned from the site indefinitely and several others were banned from topics relating to Gamergate or gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/01/29/gamergate-wikipedia-and-the-limits-of-human-knowledge/ | title=Gamergate, Wikipedia and the limits of 'human knowledge' | work=Washington Post | date=29 January 2015 | accessdate=30 January 2015 | author=Dewey, Caitlin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 study found that the Committee's decision-making was mostly unaffected by extra-legal factors such as nationality, activity/experience, conflict avoidance, and time constraints. The same study found that the Committee's decision-making was affected much more by time constraints than that of conventional courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Konieczny |first=Piotr |date=2017-08-11 |title=Decision making in the self-evolved collegiate court: Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee and its implications for self-governance and judiciary in cyberspace |journal=International Sociology |volume=32 |issue=6 |language=en |pages=755–774 |doi=10.1177/0268580917722906 |issn=0268-5809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3785">The '''Arizona Bar Exam''' is the exam administered by the Admissions Unit of the Certification and Licensing Division of the [[Supreme Court of Arizona]]. A satisfactory score on the Arizona Bar Exam is one of numerous requirements for admission to be admitted as an attorney in the [[Arizona|State of Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supreme.state.az.us/admis/ Admissions Unit, Admission to the Practice of Law] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081213203926/http://www.supreme.state.az.us/admis/ |date=December 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format of Exam ==
The Arizona Bar Exam is a two-day exam. The first day of the exam consists of 6 essay questions testing common law and legal principles generally recognized throughout the United States, and 2 MPT questions testing legal analysis and writing. The second day of the exam consists of the [[Multistate Bar Exam]], a multiple choice examination administered by the National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE).

===First Day===
The essay portion of the Arizona Bar Exam may test the following subjects: 
*Contracts;
*Torts;
*Federal constitutional law;
*Criminal law;
*Constitutional criminal procedure;
*Evidence
*Real Property
*Business organizations (Corporations, Partnerships, etc.);
*UCC 9 (Secured Transactions);
*Wills &amp; trusts;
*Family law;
*Professional responsibility;
*Federal civil procedure; and
*Conflicts of law

As of the July, 2012 exam, Arizona is now administering the [[Uniform Bar Examination]] (UBE) which does not include:
*[[Community property]]; or
*Arizona constitutional law

===Second Day===
Day two of the exam consists of the [[Multistate Bar Exam]] or MBE.  This is the multiple-choice portion of the bar exam. The MBE is a six-hour, exam consisting of two hundred multiple-choice questions covering [[Contracts]] and [[Sales]], [[Torts]], [[Constitutional law]], [[Criminal law]], [[Evidence]], and [[Real Property]], [[Federal civil procedure]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbex.org/multistate-tests/mbe/ National Conference of Bar Examiners, Multistate Bar Exam (MBE)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217164447/http://www.ncbex.org/multistate-tests/mbe/ |date=December 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The MBE is divided into two period of three hours each, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. There are 100 questions administered in each 3-hour period.  There are 34 questions each in Contracts and Torts, and 33 questions each in Constitutional Law, Criminal Law (including aspects of Criminal Procedure), Evidence, and Real Property.

==Grading information==
A new scoring system will be effective from July 2012 forward. The Multistate Bar Exam is scaled from 1-200. The highest possible Arizona essay exam score is 120 for the essay portion and 80 for the MPT. Arizona combines the three sections for a total of 400 points. In order to be deemed successful on the Arizona Bar Exam, applicants must achieve a combined score of 273 or higher.

== MPRE Requirements ==
In addition to successfully passing the Arizona Bar Exam, an applicant must attain a scaled score of 85 on the [[Multistate Professional Responsibility Exam]] within two (2) years before the successful bar exam or within the time frame for taking the oath of admission after the successful bar exam &lt;ref&gt;http://www.azcourts.gov/Portals/26/admis/2015/AARules_Jan2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (An applicant must pass MPRE prior to being sworn in). The MPRE is administered separately from the Arizona Bar Exam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3673">In the most common types of [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]] proceedings in the United States federal courts, a '''certificate of appealability''' is a legal document that must be issued before a petitioner may appeal from a denial of the writ.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{small caps|Fed. R. App. P.}} [https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frap/rule_22 22(b)(1)].&lt;/ref&gt; The certificate may only be issued when the petitioner has made a "substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right."&lt;ref&gt;28 U.S.C. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/2253#c § 2253(c)(2).]&lt;/ref&gt;

The application may be made explicitly, but a notice of appeal made without a certificate of appealability is treated as an implicit application for the certificate.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{small caps|Fed. R. App. P.}} [https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frap/rule_22 22(b)(2)] ("If no express request for a certificate is filed, the notice of appeal constitutes a request addressed to the judges of the court of appeals.").&lt;/ref&gt; "To obtain a [certificate of appealability], the [petitioner] must make a request to a district or circuit court judge. In the application, the [petitioner] includes the issues he wishes to raise on appeal. In general, the application process is informal, there is no hearing, and the government rarely files a brief in response to the prisoner's request. The determination is simply made in chambers. If the district court judge denies the request, the [petitioner] may apply to the circuit judge. In addition, a notice of appeal to the circuit court can be treated as a request for a COA."&lt;ref&gt;Margaret A. Upshaw, ''[https://lawreview.uchicago.edu/sites/lawreview.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/82_3/09%20Upshaw_CMT_Online%20REVISED.pdf The Unappealing State of Certificates of Appealability]'', 82 {{small caps|[[The University of Chicago Law Review|U. Chi. L. Rev.]]}} 1609, 1615 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Rule 22 of the [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure]], "a certificate of appealability is not required when a state or its representative or the United States or its representative appeals."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frap/rule_22 {{small caps|Fed. R. App. P.}} 22(b)(3).]&lt;/ref&gt; A certificate of appealability is also not required for petitioners seeking a writ of [[coram nobis]]; however, the writ of coram nobis is only available for those who are no longer in-custody (or on probation) and the issues raised in the petition could not have been known while the petitioner was in-custody.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=404840111229367794&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Baptiste'', 223 F.3d 188, 189 n. 1 (3d Cir.2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]] changed the procedures for issuing a certificate of appealability in federal court. Under the 1996 law, "there can be no appeal from a final order in a §2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability."&lt;ref name="welch-slip-opinion"&gt;[[Welch v. United States]], 578 U.S. ___, [https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-6418_2q24.pdf No. 15-6418] (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] held in ''[[Slack v. McDaniel]]'', 529 U.S. 473 (2000), that the standard for issuing a certificate is whether "reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner."&lt;ref&gt;Welch, slip op. at 6 (quoting Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000)) (quotation marks omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1659">'''Colex Enterprises''' was a joint venture company between [[Columbia Pictures Television]] and [[Lexington Broadcast Services Company|LBS Communications, Inc.]], active from January 30, 1984 to January 1, 1988. The name of the joint venture is a portmanteau of the two companies' names ('''Co'''lumbia and '''Lex'''ington, the latter coming from LBS' original name of Lexington Broadcast Services).&lt;ref name="broadcasting19840130"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1984-01-30|title=Sale in the works for 'Eden' mini-series|journal=Broadcasting|page= 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was responsible for distributing the [[Screen Gems]] television output, as well as many of the post-1948 [[Bob Hope]] theatrical output, with the exception of Hanna-Barbera produced programs. Colex also distributed the syndicated sitcom series ''[[What's Happening Now!!]]'', which was later distributed by LBS and [[Coca-Cola Telecommunications]] on its final season.

==History==

The '''Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000''' (CFMA) is United States federal legislation that officially ensured modernized [[regulation]]&lt;ref&gt;http://mercatus.org/publication/did-deregulation-cause-financial-crisis-examining-common-justification-dodd-frank&lt;/ref&gt; of [[financial products]] known as [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] (OTC) [[Derivative (finance)|derivative]]s. It was signed into law on December 21, 2000 by [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]].  It clarified the law so most OTC derivative transactions between "sophisticated parties" would not be regulated as "futures" under the [[Commodity Exchange Act]] of 1936 (CEA) or as "securities" under the federal securities laws. Instead, the major dealers of those products (banks and securities firms) would continue to have their dealings in OTC derivatives supervised by their federal regulators under general "safety and soundness" standards. The [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]]'s (CFTC) desire to have "functional regulation" of the market was also rejected.

== Introduction ==
Before and after the CFMA, federal banking regulators imposed capital and other requirements on banks that entered into [[Derivative (finance)#OTC and exchange-traded|OTC derivatives]].&lt;ref&gt;GAO 1994 Financial Derivatives Report at 74 to 78 for a description of the then existing bank capital requirements for OTC derivatives and 69 to 84 for a description of then existing overall regulatory requirements. GAO Financial Derivatives Report at 53 to 55 for the later "expanded" regulatory capital requirements and 53 to 69 on the overall "improved" oversight of bank OTC derivatives activities. GAO Risk-Based Capital Report at 118 for a detailed description of bank capital requirement computations for OTC derivatives.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and CFTC had limited "risk assessment" authority over OTC derivatives dealers affiliated with securities or commodities brokers and also jointly administered a voluntary program under which the largest securities and commodities firms reported additional information about derivative activities, management controls, risk and capital management, and counterparty exposure policies that were similar to, but more limited than, the requirements for banks.&lt;ref&gt;GAO 1994 Financial Derivatives Report at 85 to 89 for the then limited oversight of securities and commodity firms (including SEC "risk assessment" authority). 1996 Financial Derivatives Report at 70 to 71, for the establishment of the CFTC's risk assessment program, and at 44 to 46 and 70 to 76 for the establishment of the Derivatives Policy Group (DPG) and the undertakings and reporting to the CFTC and SEC of its member firms.&lt;/ref&gt; Banks and securities firms were the dominant dealers in the market, with commercial bank dealers holding by far the largest share.&lt;ref&gt;GAO 1994 Financial Derivatives Report at 11 (commercial bank dealers accounted for about 70% of the total volume at the end of 1992). GAO 1996 Financial Derivatives Report at 27 (for the 15 major dealers tracked by the GAO in the two reports (7 commercial banks, 5 securities firms, and 3 insurance companies) commercial banks accounted for about 69% of total volume each year from 1990 through 1995, securities firms about 27%, and insurance companies about 4%). Ekaterina E. Emm and Gerald D. Gay, "The Global Market for OTC Derivatives: An Analysis of Dealer Holding", September 23, 2003 ("Emma/Gay Global Markets Study") (showing in Table 3 that in 1995 the ten largest dealers held 85% of the US volume, with the 5 commercial banks in the listing holding 57.43% of the total and the 5 listed investment banks holding 27.75% and that in 2000 the ten largest dealers holding 92% of total volume with the 4 listed commercial banks holding 61%, the 4 listed investment banks holding 28%, and the two insurance companies (AIG and General Re) holding just over 3%. PWG Report at 16 (noting most dealers were banks or affiliated with securities firms).&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent [[insurance]] company affiliates acted as dealers of OTC derivatives rather than as counterparties to transactions with banks or security firm affiliates, they had no such federal "safety and soundness" regulation of those activities and typically conducted the activities through London-based affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;GAO 1994 Financial Derivatives Report at 90 to 91 (concluding "Derivatives dealer affiliates of insurance companies are subject to minimal reporting requirements and no capital requirement" while noting state insurance regulators informed the GAO "derivatives dealer affiliates voluntarily hold capital against derivatives exposures as part of effective risk-management practices.") GAO 1996 Financial Derivatives Report at 80 to 81 (concluding "state insurance regulatory oversight remains unchanged" and noting "although the financial results of derivatives dealer affiliates are part of consolidated insurance company financial reports to regulators, these affiliates continue to have no capital or examination requirements.") GAO 1994 Financial Derivatives Report at 188 (listing AIG, General Re, and Prudential as the three largest insurance company derivatives dealers in 1992.)

For AIG FP's London-based dealer operation, see note 81 below.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFMA continued an existing 1992 preemption of state laws enacted in the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1992 which prevented the law from treating eligible OTC derivatives transactions as gambling or otherwise illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isda.org/speeches/pdf/analysis_of_commodity-exchange-act-legislation.pdf Analysis of Commodity Futures Modernization Act 2000 - ISDA]. [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association]].&lt;/ref&gt; It also extended that preemption to security-based derivatives that had previously been excluded from the CEA and its preemption of state law.&lt;ref&gt;See notes 43 and 80 below.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFMA, as enacted by [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]], went beyond the recommendations of a Presidential Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) Report titled "Over-the Counter Derivatives and the Commodity Exchange Act." (the "[[PWG Report]]&lt;ref name="PWG Report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets and the Commodity Exchange Act|url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Documents/otcact.pdf|accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ").

Although hailed by the PWG on the day of congressional passage as "important legislation" to allow "the United States to maintain its competitive position in the over-the-counter derivative markets", by 2001 the [[Enron scandal|collapse of Enron]] brought public attention to the CFMA's treatment of energy derivatives in the "[[Enron Loophole]]." Following the [[Federal Reserve]]'s emergency loans to "rescue" [[American International Group]] (AIG) in September, 2008, the CFMA has received even more widespread criticism for its treatment of credit default swaps and other OTC derivatives.{{efn|For the quoted language see PWG December 15, 2000, letters to Senator Thomas Harkin, Ranking Member of Senate Agriculture Committee&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?position=all&amp;page=S11897&amp;dbname=2000_record Congressional Record, S. 11896, December 15, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; and to Senator Paul Sarbanes, Ranking Member of Senate Banking Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2000_record&amp;page=S11946&amp;position=all Congressional Record, S11946, January 2, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; These letters were issued jointly by the four members of the PWG on December 15, 2000, for use in the Senate consideration that day of H.R. 5660 as part of H.R. 4577. While no such letters were introduced in the House during its debate of H.R. 4577, as described in note 69 below, Representative Charles Stenholm (D-TX) stated H.R. 5660 was "broadly supported" by the Administration and the PWG and Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-TX) confirmed that H.R. 5660 was "acceptable" to the [[United States Treasury Department]], CFTC, and SEC. Despite this, as described in note 70 below, the narrative has been widely circulated that a single Senator, Senator [[Phil Gramm]] (R-TX), somehow "slipped in" or "sneaked in" to H.R. 4577 the CFMA.

==Background to the CFMA==

===OTC derivatives regulation before the CFMA===

====Exchange trading requirement====

The [[PWG Report]] was directed at ending controversy over how [[Swap (finance)|swaps]] and other OTC derivatives related to the CEA. A [[derivative (finance)|derivative]] is a financial contract or instrument that "derives" its value from the price or other characteristic of an underlying "thing" (or "commodity"). A farmer might enter into a "derivative contract" under which the farmer would sell from next summer's harvest a specified number of bushels of wheat at a specified price per bushel. If this contract were executed on a commodity exchange, it would be a "futures contract."{{efn|For the background to and purpose of the PWG Report, see [http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/reports/otcact.pdf "Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets and the Commodity Exchange Act", Report of The President's Working Group on Financial Markets, November 1999] (PWG Report) at 10 to 18, and [http://opencrs.com/document/RL30434 Mark Jickling, "The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000: Derivatives Regulation Reconsidered", RL30434], updated January 29, 2003, Congressional Research Service Report for Congress (CRS Derivatives Regulation Report) at CRS-7 to 8. For definitions of derivatives, see the PWG Report at 4 to 5 and the CRS Derivatives Regulation Report at CRS-2. As described further below in this Section 1.1.1, a farmer would have the possibility to enter into such a pricing contract with a grain elevator or other buyer, in which case the contract might be a "[[forward delivery]]" and not a "future delivery" contract. A "[[futures contract]]", however, is not defined by whether it is executed on a commodity exchange. The CFTC has long brought actions against illegal "futures contracts" executed off a regulated exchange. Philip McBride Johnson and Thomas Lee Hazen, ''Derivatives Regulation'' (successor edition to ''Commodities Regulation, Third Edition'') (Aspen Publishers 2004, supplemented through 2009 Cumulative Supplement) ("Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation Treatise") at 50 to 53. [http://agriculture.senate.gov/Hearings/Hearings_1998/born730.htm Testimony of Brooksley Born, Chairwoman Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Concerning the Over-the Counter Derivatives Market, before the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, July 30, 1998] ("Born July 1998 Senate Agriculture Testimony") at 10, in the text leading to footnote 35 for that testimony ("It is the nature of the instruments, and not where they are traded, that determines jurisdiction under the CEA.")}}

Before 1974, the CEA only applied to agricultural commodities. "Future delivery" contracts in agricultural commodities listed in the CEA were required to be traded on regulated exchanges such as the [[Chicago Board of Trade]].&lt;ref name="Johnson_etc"&gt;Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation Treatise at 6 to 9. Jerry W. Markham, ''Commodities Regulation: Fraud, Manipulation &amp; Other Claims'' Volume 13A Securities Law Series (West Group 1987, supplemented through Release 11, April 2009) ("Markham CF Law Treatise") at pages 27-18 to 27-19 and 28-1 through 28-7.

CRS Derivatives Regulation Report at CRS-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act of 1974]] created the CFTC as the new regulator of commodity exchanges. It also expanded the scope of the CEA to cover the previously listed agricultural products and "all other goods and articles, except onions, and all services, rights, and interests in which contracts for future delivery are presently or in the future dealt in." Existing non-exchange traded financial "commodity" derivatives markets (mostly "[[interbank]]" markets) in foreign currencies, government securities, and other specified instruments were excluded from the CEA through the "[[Treasury Amendment]]", to the extent transactions in such markets remained off a "board of trade." The expanded CEA, however, did not generally exclude financial derivatives.&lt;ref name="Johnson_etc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the Treasury Amendment, see also Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation Treatise at 9 to 10; CRS Derivatives Regulation Report at CRS-6; and PWG Report at 24 to 27. Before the CFTC, a Commodity Exchange Authority under the control of the Secretary of Agriculture regulated commodity exchanges. Jerry W. Markham,''The History of Commodity Futures Trading and its Regulation'', (Praeger 1987) ("Markham CF Trading History") at 27 to 60. For background to the reasoning of the PWG Report, see the [http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/bank/hba50076.000/hba50076_0f.htm July 24, 1998 Hearing before the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services] ("July 24, 1998, House Banking Hearing") at pages 150-156 for Alan Greenspan's extended critique of the application of the CEA to non-agricultural commodities. The transcript excerpts are in Segment 2 because the July 24, 1998, hearing was the second of two hearings by the Committee concerning H.R. 4062, legislation mentioned in Section 1.2 below that ultimately led to a moratorium on CFTC action to change the regulatory status of OTC derivatives. For how the "board of trade" qualification made it difficult for the CFTC to attack currency trading "bucket shops", see CFTC Chair William Rainer testimony at page 28 of [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_senate_hearings&amp;docid=f:67569.pdf Hearing before the Senate Agriculture Committee on the PWG Report, February 10, 2000,] ("Senate Agriculture PWG Report Hearing") and Markham CF Trading History at 238 to 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1974 law change, the CEA continued to require that all "future delivery" contracts in commodities covered by the law be executed on a regulated exchange. This meant any "future delivery" contract entered into by parties off a regulated exchange would be illegal and unenforceable. The term "future delivery" was not defined in the CEA. Its meaning evolved through CFTC actions and court rulings.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation Treatise at 50 to 54. CRS Derivatives Regulation Report at CRS-5. PWG Report at 6. The CEA required that futures contracts be transacted on a "contract market" designated by the CFTC. "Designated contract markets" (such as the Chicago Board of Trade, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, or New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)) are generally referred to as "exchanges" but are also called "boards of trade." Markham CF Trading History at 15 and 69. For the notion the meaning of "future delivery" evolved, see [http://www.gao.gov/archive/2000/gg00089.pdf GAO Report, "CFTC and SEC: Issues Related to the Shad-Johnson Jurisdictional Accord", GAO/GGD-00-89], April 2000 ("GAO Shad-Johnson Report") at 14, fn. 35 ("the definition has evolved through judicial and agency interpretations.") For a broader discussion of the issue see GAO CEA Issues Report at 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all derivative contracts are "future delivery" contracts. The CEA always excluded "forward delivery" contracts under which, for example, a farmer might set today the price at which the farmer would deliver to a [[grain elevator]] or other buyer a certain number of bushels of wheat to be harvested next summer. By the early 1980s a market in interest rate and currency "swaps" had emerged in which banks and their customers would typically agree to exchange interest or currency amounts based on one party paying a fixed interest rate amount (or an amount in a specified currency) and the other paying a floating interest rate amount (or an amount in a different currency). These transactions were similar to "forward delivery" contracts under which "commercial users" of a commodity contracted for future deliveries of that commodity at an agreed upon price.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation Treatise at 29 to 46. Markham CF Law Treatise at pages 27-21 to 27-26. Markham CF Trading History at 202 to 203 (for "forwards") and 232 to 233 (for "swaps"). CRS Derivatives Regulation Report at CRS-6. The term "swap" refers to parties exchanging or "swapping" payments. The use of the term expanded to cover derivatives such as "caps" and "floors" under which one party paid a fee in return for the right to receive payments in the future based on whether an interest rate (or other price) exceeded a specified level (a cap) or dropped below a specified level (a floor). Testimony of Richard Grove at page 34 of the Senate Agriculture PWG Report Hearing ("off-exchange principal-to-principal derivatives transactions...are typically referred to as swaps.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the similarities between swaps and "forward delivery" contracts, the swap market grew rapidly in the United States during the 1980s. Nevertheless, as a 2006 Congressional Research Service report explained in describing the status of OTC derivatives in the 1980s: "if a court had ruled that a swap was in fact an illegal, off-exchange futures contract, trillions of dollars in outstanding swaps could have been invalidated. This might have caused chaos in financial markets, as swaps users would suddenly be exposed to the risks they had used derivatives to avoid."&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RS21401_20060421.pdf Mark Jickling, "Regulation of Energy Derivatives" RS21401], CRS Report for Congress, updated April 21, 2006 ("CRS Energy Derivatives Report") at CRS-3. For a broader review of "legal uncertainty" issues and the 1999 PWG's view of how those issues led to its recommendations that formed the basis for the CFMA, see PWG Report at 6 through 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Legal certainty" through regulatory exemptions====

To eliminate this risk, the CFTC and the Congress acted to give "legal certainty" to swaps and, more generally, to the OTC derivatives market activities of "sophisticated parties."

First, the CFTC issued "policy statements" and "statutory interpretations" that swaps, "hybrid instruments" (i.e., securities or deposits with a derivative component), and certain "forward transactions" were not covered by the CEA. The CFTC issued the forward transactions "statutory interpretation" in response to a court ruling that a "Brent" (i.e., North Sea) oil "forward delivery" contract was, in fact, a "future delivery" contract, which could cause it to be illegal and unenforceable under the CEA. This, along with a court ruling in the United Kingdom that swaps entered into by a local UK government unit were illegal, elevated concerns with "legal certainty."&lt;ref&gt;GAO CEA Issues Report at 11 to 14. Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation Treatise at 55 to 60 (for swaps and hybrids) and 67 to 69 (for forward transactions). Markham CF Law Treatise at pages 27-23 to 25. For the effects of the UK court decision, see [http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat3/151647.pdf GAO Report, "Financial Derivatives: Actions Needed to Protect the Financial System", GAO/GGD-94-133], May 1994, ("GAO 1994 Derivatives Report") at 64 to 66. A typical "hybrid instrument" would be a bank deposit that provided an "extra" interest amount based on the return on the S&amp;P 500 Index or a security that provided a return tied in part to the appreciation of the yen or some other currency relative to the dollar. For a description of more complex "hybrid instruments", see [[Frank Partnoy]], ''F.I.A.S.C.O.: the inside story of a Wall Street trader'' (Penguin 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, in response to this concern about "legal certainty", Congress (through the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1992 (FTPA)) gave the CFTC authority to exempt transactions from the exchange trading requirement and other provisions of the CEA. The CFTC used that authority (as Congress contemplated or "instructed") to exempt the same three categories of transactions for which it had previously issued policy statements or statutory interpretations. The FTPA also provided that such CFTC exemptions preempted any state law that would otherwise make such transactions illegal as gambling or otherwise. To preserve the 1982 [[Shad-Johnson Accord]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/archive/2000/gg00089.pdf CFTC and SEC: Issues Related to the Shad-Johnson Jurisdictional Accord]&lt;/ref&gt; which prohibited futures on "non-exempt securities", the FTPA prohibited the CFTC from granting an exemption from that prohibition. This would later lead to concerns about the "legal certainty" of swaps and other OTC derivatives related to "securities."&lt;ref&gt;GAO CEA Issues Report at 12 to 17. PWG Report at 8 to 10. Markham CF Law Treatise at pages 27-23 to 27-26. Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation Treatise at 43 to 48 and 60 to 66. For the significance of the 1992 legislation's preemption of state laws, see Born July 30, 1998, Senate Agriculture Testimony at 6 where Chairperson Born describes its role in providing "legal certainty." As noted in the GAO CEA Issues Report at 15, the Conference Report for the FTPA stated: "The Conferees do not intend that the exercise of exemptive authority by the Commission would require any determination beforehand that the agreement, instrument, or transaction for which an exemption is sought is subject to the Act." H10937, Congressional Record, October 2, 1992. The entire Conference Report for the FTPA is available by searching "conference report on H.R. 707" at this link for the [http://thomas.loc.gov/home/r102query.html Search the Congressional Record on the 102d Congress page of The Library of Congress Thomas service ("Thomas LOC").] The Conference Report also stated (at H10936) that "the Conferees expect and strongly encourage the Commission to use its new exemptive powers promptly upon enactment of this legislation in four areas where significant concerns of legal uncertainty have arisen: (1) hybrids, (2) swaps, (3) forwards, and (4) bank deposits and accounts." The Report went on to explain (at H10937) the "forwards" were the oil market transactions covered by the existing Brent oil market "statutory interpretation." For the view Congress had thereby "instructed" the CFTC to grant the exemptions, see the testimony of CFTC Chair William Rainer at Senate Agriculture PWG Report Hearing at 15 ("amid strong signals that swap market participants feared their contracts could be declared unenforceable, Congress reacted decisively instructing the CFTC not to regulate swaps entered into by sophisticated parties.") See also [http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/gg99074.pdf GAO Report "The Commodity Exchange Act: Issues Related to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's Reauthorization", GAO/GGD-99-74], May 1999 ("GAO 1999 CFTC Reauthorization Report") at 10 ("According to the 1992 act's legislative history, Congress expected CFTC to use its exemptive authority promptly to reduce legal risk for swaps, forwards, and hybrids.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the existing statutory exclusion for "forward delivery" contracts, the 1989 "policy statement" on swaps had required that swaps covered by the "policy statement" be privately negotiated transactions between sophisticated parties covering (or "hedging") risks arising from their business (including investment and financing) activities. The new "swaps exemption" dropped the "hedging" requirement. It continued to require the swap be entered into by "sophisticated parties" (i.e., "eligible swap participants") in private transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Before the FTPA exemptions were issued, the elements required by the CFTC policy statement were (1) individually negotiated (not "standardized") terms, (2) no "offset" or other termination except as privately agreed, (3) credit exposure between the parties (i.e., no intervening "clearing facility" or full margin requirement guaranteeing against defaults), (4) contracting only in connection with a line of business (including "financial intermediation" for banks and other dealers) or financing such a business, and (5) no marketing to the public. CFTC. "Policy Statement Concerning Swap Transactions", 54 Federal Register 30694 (July 21, 1989). GAO CEA Issues Report at 12 to 13. PWG Report at 10. Markham CF Law Treatise at page 27-23. Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation Treatise at 43. The exemptions under the FTPA required that the transaction (1) be between "eligible swap participants" (defined as businesses, government entities, investment pools, and high-net-worth individuals), (2) not be standardized in material economic terms, (3) subject each party to the credit risk of the other, (4) and not be traded on a "multilateral transaction execution facility" on which multiple parties could offer and accept transactions. CFTC, "Exemption for Certain Swap Agreements", 58 Federal Register 5587 (January 22, 1993).  GAO CEA Issues Report at 14 to 16. PWG Report at 10 to 12. Markham CF Law Treatise at pages 27-25 to 26. Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation Treatise at 43 to 44 and 47 to 49 (which notes, at 44, that the swaps exemption retained for qualifying swaps that might still be "futures" the "antifraud and antimanipulation provisions" of the CEA).  GAO 1999 CFTC Reauthorization Report at 10 to 11. The FTPA exemption, therefore, more broadly permitted "speculators" in the swaps market and tailored the exemption to the financial "sophistication" of the parties and the absence of both exchange style "netting" of exposures and public availability of offers. For the role of "speculators" in OTC derivatives markets, see [https://wikileaks.org/leak/crs/RL34555.pdf Mark Jickling and Lynn J. Cunningham, "Speculation and Energy Prices: Legislative Responses", RL 34555, CRS Report for Congress] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212004813/http://wikileaks.org/leak/crs/RL34555.pdf |date=2009-02-12 }}, updated August 6, 2008. The requirements for "hybrid instruments" under the 1990 "statutory interpretation" and the 1993 exemption were similar. Both required that the instrument be a security or bank deposit, the commodity dependent value of the instrument be limited, the instrument not be marketed as a commodity option or futures contract, and the instrument not be subject to settlement through a delivery instrument specified by a regulated exchange. While there were further requirements for each, the 1993 exemption moved towards criteria later included in the CFMA in requiring that the instrument be regulated by the SEC or banking regulators and that the issuer receive full payment at the time of sale and not receive future payments from the holder. CFTC, "Statutory Interpretation Concerning Certain Hybrid Instruments", 55 Federal Register 13582 (April 11, 1990) (for the hybrid instrument statutory interpretation). CFTC, "Regulation of Hybrid Instruments", 58 Federal Register 5580 (January 22, 1993) (for the hybrid instrument exemption). PWG Report at 28. Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation at 59 to 60. The 1990 "forward transaction" statutory interpretation and 1993 exemption were similar in requiring that the transaction be between "commercial" parties able to make or take delivery of the energy product, that the agreement be subject to individual negotiation between the two parties, and that the contract create binding obligations to make and take delivery, with no automatic right to make cash settlement.

Although OTC derivatives were subject to criticism in the 1990s and bills were introduced in Congress to regulate aspects of the market, the 1993 exemptions remained in place. Bank regulators issued guidelines and requirements for bank OTC derivatives activities that responded to many of the concerns raised by Congress, the General Accounting Office (GAO), and others. Securities firms agreed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and CFTC to establish a Derivatives Policy Group through which six large securities firms conducting the great majority of securities firm OTC derivatives activities reported to the CFTC and SEC about their activities and adopted voluntary principles similar to those applicable to banks. Insurance companies, which represented a much smaller part of the market, remained outside any federal oversight of their OTC derivatives activities.&lt;ref&gt;Markham CF Law Treatise at pages 27-38 to 27-49.

===CFTC/SEC dispute and PWG Report as basis for the CFMA===

====Dispute====

In 1997 and 1998 a conflict developed between the CFTC and the SEC over an SEC proposal to ease its broker-dealer regulations for securities firm affiliates that engaged in OTC derivatives activities. The SEC had long been frustrated that those activities were conducted outside the regulated broker-dealer affiliates of securities firms, often outside the United States in London or elsewhere. To bring the activities into broker-dealer supervision, the SEC proposed relaxed net capital and other rules (known as "Broker-Dealer Lite") for OTC derivatives dealers. The CFTC objected that some activities that would be authorized by this proposal were not permitted under the CEA. The CFTC also issued a "concept release" requesting comments on whether the OTC derivatives market was properly regulated under the existing CEA exemptions and on whether market developments required regulatory changes.&lt;ref&gt;Markham CF Law Treatise at pages 27-81 to 27-84 and pages 28-30 to 28-31. Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation Treatise at 45 to 46. For a contemporaneous description of how the SEC's proposal set off the dispute see Professor John C. Coffee's testimony at pages 77 to 82 of the [http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/bank/hba50076.000/hba50076_0f.htm July 17, 1998, Hearing before the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services] ("July 17, 1998, House Banking Hearing").

[[File:Pr4262ls-treasury-rubin.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Robert Rubin]], Treasury Secretary, Jan 1995-Jul 1999]]

The CFTC's actions were widely viewed as a response to the SEC's Broker-Dealer Lite proposal and, at least by Professor [[John C. Coffee]], as perhaps an attempt to force the SEC to withdraw the proposal. The CFTC expressed dismay over the Broker-Dealer Lite proposal and the manner in which it was issued, but also noted it was 18 months into a "comprehensive regulatory reform effort." The same day the CFTC issued its "concept release" Treasury Secretary [[Robert Rubin]], [[Federal Reserve Board]] Chair [[Alan Greenspan]], and SEC Chair [[Arthur Levitt]] (who, along with CFTC Chair [[Brooksley Born]], were the members of the PWG) issued a letter asking Congress to prevent the CFTC from changing its existing treatment of OTC derivatives. They argued that, by calling into question whether swaps and other OTC derivatives were "futures", the CFTC was calling into question the legality of security related OTC derivatives for which the CFTC could not grant exemptions (as described in Section 1.1.2 above) and, more broadly, undermining an "implicit agreement" not to raise the question of the CEA's coverage of swaps and other established OTC derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;Markham CF Law Treatise at pages 27-83 to 84 and page 28-20. (At page 27-83 it states, "The CFTC's action was actually a thinly disguised response to an SEC proposal to pull the derivatives dealers under its regulatory umbrella"). Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation Treatise at 45 to 46. For Professor Coffee's judgment see pages 82 to 83 of the July 17, 1998, House Banking Hearing. ("It may be in part their game plan that enough pressure, enough pain being caused to all, will lead the SEC to back down and withdraw their deregulatory proposals in their Broker Lite rule. If that happens, a tactic that I think is unfair will have worked, and it will probably be used again in what I think are the likelihood of continuing border wars between agencies that have somewhat overlapping jurisdiction.") In 2002, Professor Coffee repeated the narrative that a "turf war" led to the CFMA at the [http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/pdf/107hrg/86213.pdf July 10, 2002 Hearing before the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, "CFTC Regulation and Oversight of Derivatives"] at 38 ("let me remind you of something you already know, but I think the record should set this forth clearly, the 2000 Act was precipitated by a turf war between the SEC and CFTC, and as a result of that, there was suddenly a serious question about the legal status of swaps and the possibility that the longstanding 1993 swaps exemption might be repealed suddenly. That sent a friction of fear across Wall Street and the President's Working Group understandably recommended that financial derivatives be deregulated to the extent they traded over-the-counter.") For the CFTC's description of events see Born July 1998 Senate Agriculture Testimony at 5 to 11. The CFTC's dissatisfaction with the Broker-Dealer Lite proposal and the fact it was issued without a PWG meeting is expressed by Chairwoman Born at pages 11&amp;ndash;14 of the [http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/ag/hagOTC.000/hagOTC_0f.htm June 10, 1998, Hearing before House Subcommittee on Risk Management and Specialty Crops].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ensuing Congressional hearings, the three members of the PWG dissenting from the CFTC's "unilateral" actions argued the CFTC was not the proper body, and the CEA was not the proper statute, to regulate OTC derivatives activities. Banks and securities firms dominated the OTC derivatives market. Their regulators needed to be involved in any regulation of the market. Bank regulators and the SEC already monitored and regulated bank and broker-dealer OTC Derivatives activities. The dissenting PWG members explained that any effort to regulate those activities through the CEA would only lead to the activities moving outside the United States. In the 1980s banks had used offshore branches to book transactions potentially covered by the CEA. Securities firms were still using London and other foreign offices to book at least securities related derivatives transactions. Any change in regulation of OTC derivatives should only occur after a full study of the issue by the entire PWG.&lt;ref&gt;July 24, 1998 House Banking Hearing; [http://agriculture.senate.gov/Hearings/Hearings_1998/gspan.htm Testimony of Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Board of Governors of Federal Reserve Board, before the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, July 30, 1998] ("Greenspan July 1998 Senate Agriculture Testimony"); [http://agriculture.senate.gov/Hearings/Hearings_1998/summers2.htm Testimony of Treasury Deputy Secretary Lawrence H. Summers] for the same July 10, 1998, Senate Agriculture Committee Hearing ("Summers July 1998 Senate Agriculture Testimony"); and [http://agriculture.senate.gov/Hearings/Hearings_1998/levitt.htm Testimony of SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt] for that July 10, 1998, Senate Agriculture Committee Hearing ("Levitt July 1998 Senate Agriculture Testimony"). In the July 24, 1998 House Banking Hearing at 171-2, Chairman Greenspan pointed to the growth of the Eurodollar market in the 1960s, which in his account was established as a way to avoid US law limiting interest on deposits, which market did not return to the US even after the regulatory issue was overcome. In the June 10, 1998, House Agriculture Subcommittee Hearing (at 42) Richard Lindsay, Director of the SEC's Division of Market Regulation, made a similar argument about the loss of US capital market activity to the Eurobond market when "a very simple law change moved the Eurobond market from the United States, where it was a vibrant market, abroad virtually overnight. And that market has never returned." While Regulation Q (the regulatory limit on deposit interest) is usually cited as the cause for the development of the Eurodollar market, there are competing views that at least a partial cause was fear of US "political risk" focused more on potential US seizures or blocks on foreign (particularly Soviet Union) money in US banks.

For the "[[forward rate agreement]]" market, which was often conducted by U.S. banks through "offshore" branches because of concern such agreements looked too much like "futures" traded on U.S. exchanges, see Philip McBride Johnson, Michael S. Sackheim and Thomas A. Hale "Future Rate Agreements: Implications under the Commodity Exchange Act", Commodities Law Letter, March 1987, at 3-6. See also notes 37, 79 (Summers response to Harkin question at Senate Agriculture PWG Report hearing), and 81 below for the issue of "offshore" booking of OTC derivative transactions.&lt;/ref&gt;

CFTC Chair Brooksley Born replied that the CFTC had exclusive authority over "futures" under the CEA and could not allow the other PWG members to dictate the CFTC's authority under that statute. She pointed out the "concept release" did not propose, nor presuppose the need for, any change in the regulatory treatment of OTC derivatives. She noted, however, that changes in the OTC derivatives market had made that market more similar to futures markets.&lt;ref&gt;Born July 1998 Senate Agriculture Testimony. In response to the complaint the CFTC had acted "unilaterally", Chairwoman Born notes, at page 13 of this testimony, that the CFTC is the federal regulator with expertise in "derivatives markets" and that statements made by the other members of the PWG indicated they were seeking to usurp control over the issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

Congress passed a law preventing the CFTC from changing its treatment of OTC derivatives through March 1999. CFTC Chair Born lost control of the issue at the CFTC when three of her four fellow Commissioners announced they supported the legislation and would temporarily not vote to take any action concerning OTC derivatives. CFTC Chair Born resigned effective June 1999.  Her successor, William Rainer, was CFTC Chair when the PWG Report was issued in November 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Markham CF Law Treatise at pages 27-83 to 84.

====Other background events====

While the dispute between the SEC and CFTC over OTC derivatives jurisdiction was at the core of pre-2008 narrations of the events leading to the CFMA, two other noteworthy background events occurred. First, in early 1997 CFTC Chairperson Born testified forcefully to Congress against a Senate bill that would have authorized futures exchanges to establish "professional markets" exempt from many regulatory requirements in a manner similar to the "regulatory relief" ultimately provided for an "exempt board of trade" under the CFMA. In her testimony to the [[Senate Agriculture Committee]] and in several subsequent speeches during the first half of 1997, Chairperson Born argued OTC derivatives did not create the same "concentration of financial risk" as exchange traded futures and did not perform the "unique price discovery" function of exchange traded contracts. She argued these differences justified different regulatory treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cftc.gov/opa/speeches/opaborn-3.htm Oral Testimony of CFTC Chairperson Brooksley Born to Senate Agriculture Committee"], February 11, 1997 ("Born February 11, 1997, Senate Oral Testimony").

[http://www.cftc.gov/opa/speeches/opaborn-5.htm "The Dangers of Deregulation", Remarks of CFTC Chairperson Brooksley Born before the Futures Industry International Association 22d Annual International Futures Industry Conference, March 13, 1997]. Chairperson Born gave the same explanation for the different regulatory treatment of exchanges and OTC derivatives in speeches to the Sixth Annual Washington Policy Council on March 31, 1997, the End Users of Derivatives Third Annual Conference on April 11, 1997, the Financial Executive Institutes Committee on Investment of Employee Benefit Assets, on April 16, 1997, the Women in Housing and Finance, Inc. on May 12, 1997, and the New York City and State Bar Associations on May 21, 1997. All of these speeches are available at [http://www.cftc.gov/newsroom/speechestestimony/archive/speeches97.html the CFTC website's archive of 1997 Speeches and Testimony]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chairperson Born's 1997 testimony on the difference between exchange and OTC markets was consistent with her first speech as CFTC Chair, on October 24, 1996, in which she stated her belief that regulation of the OTC derivatives market should be limited to fraud and manipulation. While her 1997 testimony opposed the Senate bill's provision to codify in law the existing CFTC regulatory exemptions for OTC derivatives, she also stated the CFTC was "watching" the OTC derivatives market with the PWG and had no plans to modify the existing CFTC exemptions for that market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cftc.gov/opa/speeches/opaborn-2.htm Remarks of CFTC Chairperson Brooksley Born to Chicago Kent-IIT Commodities Law Institute, October 24, 1996] ("in my view, it is appropriate that regulation of this market ["the domestic over-the-counter market"] should be limited to issues relating to fraud and manipulation.") Born February 11, 1997, Senate Oral Testimony (in which Chairperson Born expressed CFTC opposition to the proposed enactment into law of existing regulatory exemptions for OTC derivatives because that "would eliminate all regulatory flexibility to respond quickly if developments in that market required , but also stated "both the Commission and the President's Working Group on Financial Markets have been watching and evaluating this enormous and evolving $53 trillion market" and "the Commission has no plans to modify its exemptions.")&lt;/ref&gt;

The futures exchanges argued they needed permission to operate "professional markets" free of "regulatory burdens" in order to compete with foreign exchanges and the OTC derivatives market that catered to the same professionals. 1997 news reports attributed the failure of the "professional markets" legislation to disagreements concerning equity derivatives between the Chicago Board of Trade and the OTC derivatives dealers, on the one side, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and others futures exchanges, on the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agriculture.senate.gov/Hearings/Hearings_1997/Futexc.htm Consolidated Tesimony of the Futures Exchanges of the United States to Senate Agriculture Committee, February 11, 1997] ("U.S. futures markets have found it increasingly difficult to compete with foreign exchanges and OTC dealers as our competition's regulatory costs have diminished or remained virtually non-existent while ours have escalated.")

Second, after the 1998 CFTC "concept release" controversy arose, [[Long-Term Capital Management]] (LTCM) became headline news with the near collapse of a hedge fund it managed. The near collapse was widely attributed to OTC derivatives transactions. At an October 1, 1998, hearing before the House Banking Committee, Chairperson Born received complements from some members of the Committee for having raised important issues in the May "concept release." The hearing, however, focused on issues with regulatory oversight of the banks and security firms that had given the LTCM fund high leverage through both loans and OTC derivative transactions.&lt;ref&gt;For the complements directed at Chairperson Born, see [http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/bank/hba51526.000/hba51526_0f.htm October 1, 1998, Hearing before House Committee on Banking and Financial Services concerning Hedge Fund Operations] at 155 to 157 for Mr. LaFalce's questioning and at 170 for Mr. Hinchey's questioning.

The 1999 GAO Report that analyzed the LTCM experience criticized federal regulators for not coordinating their oversight of LTCM's activities with banks and securities firms. The Report also recommended "consideration of" legislation to grant the SEC and CFTC consolidated supervision authority for securities and commodities firms in order to supervise the OTC derivatives activities of those consolidated entities in a manner similar to the Federal Reserve's authority over bank holding companies. The GAO Report did not consider, and did not recommend, CFTC regulation of OTC derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gao.gov/archive/2000/gg00003.pdf GAO Report, "Long-Term Capital Management: Regulators Need to Focus Greater Attention on Systemic Risk," GAO/GGD-00-3], October 1999 ("GAO LTCM Report") at 16 to 17 (for "regulators did not identify weaknesses in firms' risk management practices until after the crisis"), 17 to 19 (for "offsite monitoring did not reveal the potential systemic threat posed by LTCM"), and 21 (for "existing coordination could be improved to enhance regulators' ability to identify risks across industries and markets.") GAO LTCM Report at 31 (for the recommendation Congress "consider providing SEC and CFTC with the authority to regulate the activities of securities and futures firms' affiliates similar to that provided the Federal Reserve with respect to bank holding companies.") [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/20/business/congressional-agency-faults-a-report-on-hedge-fund-risk.html "Congressional Agency Faults a Report on Hedge-Fund Risk"], ''The New York Times'', November 20, 1999. Michael Schroeder, "General Accounting Office's Report Urges Tighter Broker-Dealer Oversight", ''The Wall Street Journal'', November 22, 1999. Both news articles stated the GAO recommended Congress enact consolidated supervision of securities and commodities firms, although the GAO Report only stated Congress should "consider" such legislation. Perhaps these news reports more accurately described GAO's actual intent.&lt;/ref&gt;

An effect of the LTCM experience was that the conference committee report adopting the six-month moratorium on CFTC action affecting OTC derivative regulation included a statement that "the conferees strongly urge" the PWG to study OTC derivatives transactions of hedge funds and others. Although Chairperson Born had explained at the October 1, 1998, House Banking Committee hearing that the CFTC's supervisory authority over the LTCM fund as a "[[commodity pool operator]]" was limited to monitoring its exchange trading activities, the CFTC's possession of financial statements for the fund received negative news coverage in November 1998 based on the fact the CFTC was the only federal regulator to receive such reports directly from LTCM and had not shared the information with other members of the PWG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov:80/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1998-10-19/pdf/CREC-1998-10-19-pt1-PgH11044-3.pdf Congressional Conference Report on H.R. 4328] at H11302, Congressional Register, October 19, 1998 (for the conferees' explanation of Section 760) and H11053 (for the Section 760 moratorium language adopted by the conferees).

====President's Working Group Report====

The PWG Report recommended: (1) the codification into the CEA, as an "exclusion", of existing regulatory exemptions for OTC financial derivatives, revised to permit electronic trading between "eligible swaps participants" (acting as "principals") and to even allow standardized (i.e. "fungible") contracts subject to "regulated" clearing; (2) continuation of the existing CFTC authority to exempt other non-agricultural commodities (such as energy products) from provisions of the CEA; (3) continuation of existing exemptions for "hybrid instruments" expanded to cover the Shad-Johnson Accord (thereby exempting from the CEA any hybrid that could be viewed as a future on a "non-exempt security"), and a prohibition on the CFTC changing the exemption without the agreement of the other members of the PWG; (4) continuation of the preemption of state laws that might otherwise make any "excluded" or "exempted" transactions illegal as gambling or otherwise; (5) as previously recommended by the PWG in its report on hedge funds, the expansion of SEC and CFTC "risk assessment" oversight of affiliates of securities firms and commodity firms engaged in OTC derivatives activities to ensure they did not endanger affiliated broker-dealers or futures commission merchants; (6) encouraging the CFTC to grant broad "deregulation" of existing exchange trading to reflect differences in (A) the susceptibility of commodities to price manipulation and (B) the "sophistication" and financial strength of the parties permitted to trade on the exchange; and (7) permission for single stock and narrow index stock futures on terms to be agreed between the CFTC and SEC.&lt;ref&gt;PWG Report at 15 to 23. CRS Derivatives Regulation Report at CRS-7 to 9. The FTPA had given the CFTC, and a 1990 law had given the SEC, limited "risk assessment" authority, but the PWG recommended expanding that authority. [http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/hedgfund.pdf "Hedge funds, Leverage, and the Lessons of Long-Term Capital Management", Report of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, April 1999] at 38-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 the CFTC had disagreed with the other members of the PWG about the scope and purposes of the CEA. Whereas the CFTC saw broad purposes in protecting "fair access" to markets, "financial integrity", "price discovery and transparency", "fitness standards," and protection of "market participants from fraud and other abuses," other members of the PWG (particularly the Federal Reserve through Alan Greenspan) found the more limited purposes of (1) preventing price manipulation and (2) protecting retail investors.&lt;ref&gt;For the CFTC's 1998 view of the scope of its responsibilities, see Born July 1998 Senate Agriculture Testimony, especially at 9. For the much more limited interpretation of the CEA's purposes, see Alan Greenspan's testimony at the July 24, 1998 House Banking Hearing at 150-156, as cited above in note 13. Chairperson Born's initial reply to that interpretation is at 178 of the same transcript ("while manipulation is one of the prohibitions in the CEA, it is only a very small part.") Treasury Department support for Chairperson Greenspan's position is available in the Summers July 1998 Senate Agriculture Testimony at 6 to 7 (the "major concerns guiding regulation of American commodity markets" have been "to protect retail investors from unscrupulous traders" and "to guard against manipulation in markets where the scope for such manipulation exists.") Although this implies those were not the exclusive purposes of the CEA, Deputy Secretary Summers added that the CFTC would need to show evidence of the need for regulation in these areas to justify action. The SEC's position was that "traditional swaps that are not traded through a multilateral transaction execution facility are not futures and are not subject to regulation under the CEA." Levitt July 1998 Senate Agriculture Testimony at 2. This reflected the SEC's 1993 view that the CFTC's 1993 "swaps exemption" was merely a confirmation of the application of the CEA, because "traditional swaps" are not "futures." Chairperson Born's testimony during the hearings related to the "concept release" indicated she believed swaps were covered by the CEA, subject to CFTC exemption. See June 10, 1998, House Agriculture Subcommittee Hearing at 22 where Chairperson Born describes the pre-1993 "policy statements" establishing "as a practical matter" the CFTC would not regulate swaps. Although the FTPA expressly provided any exemptions granted by the CFTC did not require a finding the exempted transaction was a "future", which the CFTC noted in each of its three exemption orders, Chairperson Born describes the FTPA as giving the CFTC "the power to exempt futures." The FTPA gave that power, but it also gave the power to exempt transactions that might not be futures. GAO CEA Issues Report at 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PWG Report ended that disagreement by analyzing only four issues in deciding not to apply the CEA to OTC derivatives. By finding (1) the sophisticated parties participating in the OTC derivatives markets did not require CEA protections, (2) the activities of most OTC derivatives dealers were already subject to direct or indirect federal oversight, (3) manipulation of financial markets through financial OTC derivatives had not occurred and was highly unlikely, and (4) the OTC derivatives market performed no significant "price discovery" function, the PWG concluded "there is no compelling evidence of problems involving bilateral swap agreements that would warrant regulation under the CEA." By essentially adopting the views of the other members of the PWG concerning the scope and application of the CEA, the CFTC permitted a "remarkable" agreement "on a redrawing of the regulatory lines."&lt;ref&gt;PWG Report at 15 to 16. CRS Derivatives Regulation Report at CRS-7 to 8. Consistent with the Greenspan and Summers testimony described in note 34 above, the analysis was centered around "sophisticated parties" and "susceptibility to manipulation" with points (1) and (2) dealing with the former and points (3) and (4) dealing with the latter. In his testimony at the Senate Agriculture PWG Report Hearing, however, CFTC Chair William Rainer distinguished (at 15) between protecting "price discovery" and protecting against "price manipulation", concluding that Congress "identified the overarching public mission of the CFTC as that of preventing price manipulation and ensuring price transparency." [https://wikileaks.org/leak/crs/RS20560.pdf Mark Jickling, "The Commodity Futures Modernization Act (P.L. 106-554)", RS20560] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211175959/http://wikileaks.org/leak/crs/RS20560.pdf |date=2009-02-11 }}, February 3, 2003 ("CRS 2003 CFMA Report") at 1 ("Apart from its substance, the Working Group's report was remarkable in that the four agencies, which had a history of jurisdictional quarrels, unanimously agreed on a redrawing of the regulatory lines.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than treat the "convergence' of OTC derivatives and futures markets as a basis for CFTC regulation of OTC derivatives, the PWG Report acknowledged and encouraged the growth in similarities between the OTC derivatives market and the regulated exchange traded futures market. Standardized terms and centralized clearing were to be encouraged, not prohibited. Price information could be broadly disseminated through "electronic trading facilities." The PWG hoped these features would (1) increase "transparency" and liquidity in the OTC derivatives market by increasing the circulation of information about market pricing and (2) reduce "systemic risk" by reducing credit exposures between parties to OTC derivatives transactions.&lt;ref&gt;PWG Report at 16 to 21. CRS Derivatives Regulation Report at CRS-8 to 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PWG Report also emphasized the desire to "maintain U.S. leadership in these rapidly developing markets" by discouraging the movement of such transactions "offshore." In the 1998 Congressional hearings concerning the CFTC "concept release" Representative James A. Leach (R-IA) had tied the controversy to "systemic risk" by arguing the movement of transactions to jurisdictions outside the United States would replace U.S. regulation with laxer foreign supervision.&lt;ref&gt;CRS Derivatives Regulation Report at CRS-8. PWG Report at 15 to 21. For Rep. Leach's views see [http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/bank/hba50076.000/hba50076_0f.htm July 17, 1998, Hearing before the House Banking and Financial Services Committee] ("July 17, 1998, House Banking Hearing") at 2. Rep. Leach had long been considered an independent student, and critic, of OTC derivatives markets. Frank Partnoy, ''Infectious greed: how deceit and risk corrupted the financial markets'' (H. Holt 2003 (First Owl books ed. 2004)) ("Infectious Greed") [https://books.google.com/books?id=TiDeKjFFWHkC&amp;pg=PA147 at 147&amp;ndash;8]. Markham CF Law Treatise at page 27&amp;ndash;43 ("An aggressive and massive report was prepared at the behest of Representative James A. Leach by the minority staff of the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs.") See also note 23 above and notes 79 (Summers response to Harkin question at Senate Agriculture PWG Report Hearing), and 81 below for the issue of "offshore" booking of OTC derivatives.&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be argued that the PWG Report recommendations and the CFMA as enacted did not change the "regulation" of OTC derivatives because there was no existing regulation under the CEA or securities laws. The change to the CEA, however, would be the elimination of existing criteria for distinguishing OTC derivatives from "futures."&lt;ref&gt;For the perspective the CFMA "updated" or "codified" existing regulatory exemptions, see CRS Derivatives Regulation Report at CRS-6 to 7 (for the view the CFMA recognized the new realities of the OTC financial derivatives market) and CRS Energy Derivatives Report at 4 ("Thus, the 2000 legislation did not deregulate the OTC energy derivatives market; that market had been unregulated since its beginnings.") For the view that the CFMA represented a change through which "the fundamental pillars of futures and commodities options regulation in the United States since 1922 have largely collapsed" so that "for the first time in the history of federal futures law, trading away from regulated markets is now permissible under certain circumstances", see Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation Treatise at 314 to 317. When the PWG Report was being considered by the Senate Agriculture Committee as a basis for legislation, a similar view was expressed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange at the Senate Agriculture PWG Report Hearing at 32 to 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==CFMA as implementation and expansion of the PWG Report==

Title I of the CFMA adopted recommendations of the PWG Report by broadly excluding from the CEA transactions in financial derivatives (i.e. "excluded commodities") between "eligible contract participants." The definition of "eligible contract participant" covered the same types of "sophisticated" parties as the existing "swaps exemption" in its definition of "eligible swap participants", but was broader, particularly by adding permission for individuals with assets of $5 million rather than $10 million, if the transaction related to managing asset or liability "risk." The PWG had recommended "considering" an increase in this threshold to $25 million, not a reduction for actual hedging.&lt;ref&gt;CRS 2003 CFMA Report at 2. [http://www.isda.org/speeches/pdf/Analysis_of_Commodity-Exchange-Act-Legislation.pdf Cravath, Swaine and Moore, "Memorandum for ISDA Members, Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000", January 5, 2001] ("ISDA CFMA Memo") at 14 to 17. Markham CF Law Treatise at pages 27-88 to 89. Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation at 330-333. For the PWG Report's recommendation concerning individuals, see PWG Report at 17 to 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such "eligible contract participants" could enter into transactions on or off "electronic trading facilities" without being subject to any of the regulatory oversight applicable to futures. The only exception was that the transactions would be subject to the rules for the new "Derivative Clearing Organizations" authorized by the CFMA, if the transaction used such a clearing facility. The CFMA did not require that standardized transaction use a clearing facility. It only authorized their existence, subject to regulatory oversight. The PWG Report had recommended permitting "standardized" contracts, so long as they were subject to regulated clearing.&lt;ref&gt;CRS 2003 CFMA Report at 2. CRS Derivatives Regulation Report at CRS-9. ISDA CFMA Memo at 23 to 28. [http://www.stroock.com/SiteFiles/Pub134.pdf Dean Kloner, "The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000"], 29 ''Securities Regulation Law Journal'' 286 (2001) ("Kloner CFMA") at 289 to 290. Markham CF Law Treatise at pages 27-88 to 89. Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation at 330-333. For the PWG Report's recommendation, see PWG Report at 17 ("insofar as transactions are subject to regulated clearing, the exclusion should not prohibit fungibility of contracts or require that creditworthiness be a material consideration.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Title I's biggest departure from the PWG Report recommendations was in extending most of the same exclusions to non-financial commodities that were not agricultural. These "exempt commodities" were, in practice, mostly energy and metal commodities. As discussed below in Section 4, these transactions were subject to the "anti-fraud" and "anti-manipulation" provisions of the CEA in some, but not all, circumstances. The PWG Report had recommended that exemptions for such transactions remain in the control of the CFTC, although it had recommended the continuation of those regulatory exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;CRS 2003 CFMA Report at 2. CRS Derivatives Regulation Report at CRS-9. ISDA CFMA Memo at 29 to 31. Kloner CFMA at 290 to 291. For the PWG recommendation concerning non-financial commodities, see PWG Report at 16 to 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Title I also resolved the issue of "hybrid instruments" by defining when such an instrument would be considered a "security" subject to security laws and excluded from the CEA even though it had a "commodity component." Equivalent treatment of bank products was provided in Title IV.&lt;ref&gt;ISDA CFMA Memo at 32 to 33. Kloner CFMA at 291 to 292. As explained in these sources, the new exclusion eliminated the existing requirement to limit the commodity component of the instrument, but otherwise retained criteria that (1) the instrument be a security regulated by the SEC or a bank product regulated by a federal banking regulator, (2) the instrument be fully paid for at issuance, with the buyer not required to make any further payment, (3) the issuer not be required to post collateral ("margin") based on any mark-to-market valuation of its obligations, and (4) the instrument not be marketed as an option or futures contract.&lt;/ref&gt;

Title I retained the CEA's existing preemption of state gambling and other laws that could render a CFTC exempted transaction illegal. It made that preemption applicable to all exempted or excluded transactions.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation at 331. ISDA CFMA Memo at 22. For the PWG recommendation on preemption see PWG Report at 18. The Title I preemption provision is Section 117 at pages 104 to 105 of [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h5660ih.txt.pdf H.R. 5660 as introduced in the House] and at pages 404 to 405 of [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ554.106.pdf H.R. 4577 as enacted into law as Public Law 106-554]. The entire CFMA appears as "Appendix E—H.R. 5660" to that Public Law (pages 367-463). A separate preemption provisions is in Section 408 of H.R. 5660. A provision of that preemption that is potentially broader than Section 117 is the preemption for a "hybrid instrument that is predominantly a banking product." The definition of "covered swap agreement" generally overlaps with the "aggregate effect' of the CEA Section 2(d)(1) exclusion for transactions in "excluded commodities", the Section 2(h)(1) exemption for transactions in "exempt commodities (both limited to transactions transacted off a "trading facility"), and the Section 2(g) exclusion for transactions in either even on an "electronic trading facility." ISDA CFMA Memo at 28 (noting as a possible difference that the Section 402(d) term "covered swap agreements" would "in the first instance be interpreted by the banking regulators" whereas the Section 105(b) "excluded swap transactions" would "in the first instance be interpreted by the CFTC.") A difference is that "covered swap agreement" would cover a transaction in "excluded commodities" on an electronic trading facility even if not subject to "individual negotiation" (compare Section 105(b) with Section 402(d)(2) of the CFMA on this).&lt;/ref&gt;

Title I also created a new system under which three different types of exchanges could be established based on the types of commodities and participants on such exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;CRS 2003 CFMA Report at 3 to 4. Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation at 320 to 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

Title II of the CFMA repealed the 1982 Shad-Johnson Accord that had prohibited single stock and narrow stock index futures and replaced that with a joint CFTC and SEC regulated "security futures" system.&lt;ref&gt;CRS 2003 CFMA Report at 3 to 4. CRS Derivatives Regulation Report at CRS-12 to 13. Markham CF Law Treatise at 27-98 to 102. Kloner CFMA at 286 to 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Title III established a framework for SEC regulation of "security-based swaps." The PWG Report had not addressed this issue.&lt;ref&gt;Kloner CFMA at 287 and 292. ISDA CFMA Memo at 40 to 43. Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation at 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

Title IV established a framework for CFTC regulation of "bank products." This included coverage of deposit based "hybrid instruments", but went further. The PWG Report had not dealt with these issues beyond how Title IV overlapped with Title I.&lt;ref&gt;Kloner CFMA at 287 and 292 to 293. ISDA CFMA Memo at 35 to 40. Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation at 340 to 341. For the PWG Report's recommendations on hybrid instruments see PWG Report at 28 to 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CFMA did not provide the CFTC or SEC the broader "risk assessment" authority over affiliates of futures commission merchants or broker-dealers that the PWG Report had recommended.&lt;ref&gt;CRS Derivatives Regulation Report at CRS-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative history of the CFMA==

===H.R. 4541 and S.2697===

H.R. 4541 was introduced in the House of Representatives on May 25, 2000, as the Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000. Three separate House Committees held hearings on the bill. Each Committee reported out a different amended version of H.R. 4541 by September 6, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d106:h.r.04541: Thomas LOC Summary and Status Page for H.R. 4541] and [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d106:HR04541:@@@C Thomas LOC Committee Page for H.R. 4541.] Aside from implementing and expanding on the PWG Report's recommendations, H.R. 4541 and S. 2697 would "reauthorize" the CFTC. Under the CEA as amended in 1974 to create the CFTC, the Commission was only "authorized" for five years. Since 1974, the "reauthorization" of the CFTC has served as the occasion for "reconsideration" of the provisions of the CEA, most dramatically in 1999 to 2000 with the CFMA. Such "reauthorization" has not always occurred on a timely basis, so that the CFTC has continued in existence on an interim basis, when (as on September 30, 2000) its "authorization" has expired. Markham CF Law Treatise at pages 28-13 to 28-20. For a description of each "reauthorization" see GAO 1999 CFTC Reauthorization Report at 55 to 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Video of debate, http://www.c-spanvideo.org/videoLibrary/congress.php?bill=97929&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 was introduced in the Senate on June 8, 2000, as S. 2697. A joint hearing of the [[United States Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry|Senate Agriculture]] and [[Senate Banking Committee|Banking]] Committees was held to consider that bill. The Senate Agriculture Committee reported out an amended version of S. 2697 on August 25, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d106:SN02697:|/bss/d106query.html Thomas LOC Summary and Status Page for S. 2697].

During the House and Senate committee hearings on these bills, Committee Chairs and Ranking Members described a tight legislative schedule for the bills because of the election year's short Congressional schedule. Sponsors had delayed introduction of the bills as they vainly awaited agreement between the CFTC and SEC on how to regulate the single stock futures contemplated by the PWG Report. That issue dominated the hearings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbanker.com/article.html?id=20000512SA9LWSIQ&amp;queryid=225740352&amp;hitnum=85 Rob Garver, "In Brief: Swaps Measure Delayed as Agencies Argue"], ''[[American Banker]]'', May 12, 2000, ( In describing Rep. Ewing's plan to offer legislation concerning swaps, the article noted Senators Lugar and Gramm "had been expected to introduce similar legislation in the Senate on Thursday, but a debate between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over other regulatory matters in the bill has held it up.") For Senate Committee Chair Lugar's remarks, see June 21, 2000, Joint Senate Committee Hearing at 2 to 3 and at 37 ("it should have been apparent to the two of you [the CFTC and SEC Chairmen] that we are intent upon passing a bill…why the two of you are not equally arduous").

See also Committee Chair Leach at 91 ("my own sense is one of great frustration working within the constraints of this Act"). Rep. Leach had introduced on April 6, 2000, his own bill [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h4203ih.txt.pdf H.R. 4203] to implement, separate from CFTC reauthorization, portions of the PWG Report applicable to OTC derivatives. As the [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d106:HR04203:@@@X Thomas LOC All Congressional Action Page for H.R. 4203] shows, this bill did not proceed past the Committee referral stage.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 14, 2000, the SEC and CFTC announced they had agreed on a joint regulation approach for "security futures." Senior Treasury Department officials hailed the "historic agreement" as eliminating "the major obstacles to forming a consensus bill."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/15/business/accord-ends-dispute-between-regulators.html "Accord Ends Dispute Between Regulators"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 15, 2000.

It is important that Congress enact such legislation this year.")&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Senator [[Phil Gramm]] (R-TX), the Chair of the Senate Banking Committee, was quoted as insisting that any bill brought to the Senate Floor would need to be expanded to include prohibitions on SEC regulation of the swaps market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbanker.com/article.html?id=20000927OGPWSDSH&amp;queryid=1975542614&amp;hitnum=15 Rob Garver, "Armey Pushes for Compromise on Swaps"], American Banker, September 27, 2000, ("Sen. Gramm said that he would prefer a bill in which the SEC and CFTC have no jurisdiction at all over swaps, but he has suggested a compromise under which the SEC would have the authority to intervene to protect customers from price manipulation or fraud.") According to internal Enron emails, Sen. Gramm had been blocking Senate action.

Democratic members of Congress later described a period in late September through early October during which they were excluded from negotiations over reconciling the three committee versions of H.R. 4541, followed by involvement in reaching an acceptable compromise that left some Republicans unhappy with the final version of the bill and some Democrats upset over the "process", particularly the involvement of Sen. Gramm and House Republican leadership in the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;The October 19, 2000, House consideration of H.R. 4541 is found at [http://www.gpo.gov:80/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-19/pdf/CREC-2000-10-19-pt1-PgH10416.pdf Congressional Record, H10416-10449, December 19, 2000].

Representative Charles Stenholm (D-TX) complained (at H10440) about the "bizarre twist" in which after the "bipartisan" development of draft bills in Committees, "the leadership intervened and decided to substitute partisan negotiations in place of the bipartisan discussions that were already under way and that were under way and that were yielding productive results." He went on to complement the leaders of the House Committees involved, particularly citing Rep. Ewing as "a true consensus builder." Rep. Edward Markey (D-MA) complained (at H10445) about "the process that has brought this bill to the floor and some of its provisions." Rep. John Dingell (D-MI) elaborated (at H10445-6) that following "one bipartisan meeting, which from all counts was constructive, Democratic staff were booted out of the negotiations on this bill, at the direction of the Republican leadership." Only when "2 weeks ago, the Committee on Agriculture majority staff started circulating drafts of legislation for Democratic review and comment" did a bill develop "which is worth moving to the next stage", although he concluded it would "not be possible to support this bill if it is not significantly improved at the next stage of the process."

Markey expanded on his Floor statements and noted the presence of Sen.

As so passed by the House, H.R. 4541 contained, in Title I, the language concerning OTC derivatives that became the source for Title I of the CFMA and, in Title II, the language regulating "security futures" that became the source for Title II of the CFMA. Titles III and IV would be added when the CFMA was enacted into law two months later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2000_record&amp;page=E2181&amp;position=all Extended Remarks of Representative [[Thomas Ewing]] (R-IL), Congressional Record, E2181-2182 (December 14, 2000)] introducing H.R. 5660 (the bill "contains the major provisions of the House passed H.R. 4541. These provisions are in Titles I and II of the legislation... ").  [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h4541eh.txt.pdf H.R. 4541 as passed by the House].

The first change led to the colloquy between Reps. Bliley and Combest described in note 69 below, in which they confirmed nothing in the CFMA granted a bank any additional power to own equity securities (which was previously covered by Section 128 of H.R. 4541). The second change lead to an overall "re-lettering" of language in Title I, because the swaps "exclusion" became Section 2(g) rather than 2(h) of the CEA. This meant the CFMA's exclusions were consecutively "lettered" as 2(c)-(g) with Section 2(h) the "exemptions." Under H.R. 4541, Section 2(g) would have been the new "exemptions" and Section 2(h) would have been the final "exclusion." The new Section 2(g) was also modified from H.R. 4541 in its definition of "swap agreement" to require "individual negotiation" but not "individual negotiation" of "each material term" (other than price and quantity) and in adding a Section 105(c) requirement for a PWG study of "retail swaps." The last change addressed an issue raised by Republican Representatives in the House Floor debate of H.R. 4541 (as described in note 58 below). The PWG issued its [http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/docs/rss-final.pdf "Joint Report on Retail Swaps"] in December 2001 and found (at page 9) it was not "necessary at this time to recommend legislative action for swap agreements offered to persons other than ECPs." Aside from these two changes and various typographical or stylistic corrections, the changes to Title I were: (1) the definition of "hybrid instrument" was expanded to permit delivery of a commodity and the H.R. 4541 definition of "deposit instrument" was replaced by the new Title IV's definition of "identified banking product" contained in Section 402(b) of H.R. 5660, which did not include the limitations for foreign and other deposits listed in H.R. 4541's exclusions for [http://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/1000-400.html#fdic1000sec.3l subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of Section 3(l) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act] (compare pages 21 and 252-253 of H.R. 5660 with pages 20-21 of H.R. 4541); (2) the new Title IV exclusions from the CEA were added to the list of excluded transactions in several parts of Title I (compare the definition of "security future" at 28 of each bill, the description of the application of the CEA in Section 107 (at 50) of H.R. 5660 and in Section 108 (at 48) of H.R. 4541, the description of transactions permitted to be cleared by a Derivatives Clearing Organization ("DCO") in Section 112 (at 88-9) of H.R. 5660 and in Section 113 (at 86) of H.R. 4541, the preemption of state law in Section 117 (at 105) in H.R. 5660 and in Section 118 (at 101-2) of H.R. 4541, and the contract enforcement provision in Section 120 (at 108) of H.R. 5660 and in Section 121 (at 105-6) in H.R. 4541); (3) the definition of "trading facility" was revised to clarify the listed "exclusions" did not require CFTC confirmation of that status (compare pages 29-31 of H.R. 5660 with pages 28-30 of H.R. 4541); (4) the definition of "excluded electronic trading facility" was expanded to expressly permit submission of transactions to a DCO for clearance without thereby becoming a "trading facility" (compare pages 37-38 of H.R. 5660 with pages 36-37 of H.R. 4541); and (5) a "Derivatives Transaction Execution Facility ("DTEF") that delegated any duties was given an explicit obligation to address non-compliance with the delegated function (compare Section 113 (at 97) of H.R. 5660 with Section 114 (at 94-5) of H.R. 4541.&lt;/ref&gt;

===From H.R. 4541 to the CFMA===

[[Image:PhilGramm.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Senator [[Phil Gramm]]]]
After the House passed H.R. 4541, press reports indicated Sen. Gramm was blocking Senate action based on his continued insistence that the bill be expanded to prevent the SEC from regulating swaps, and the desire to broaden the protections against CFTC regulation for "bank products."&lt;ref&gt;Even before House passage of H.R. 4541, press reports and statements by Republicans in the Congressional Record indicated Republican unhappiness with the "compromise" reached on H.R. 4541.

While the October 2000 Congressional Record statements of Democrats referenced in note 54 above showed unhappiness with the "process" by which they were excluded from negotiations, with late input leading to an acceptable bill, October 19, 2000, Congressional Record statements by Republican Representatives (in the discussion at H10416-10449 cited and linked in note 54 above) expressed unhappiness the bill did not contain broader "protections." Rep. Jim Leach (at H10444 and again in "extended remarks" at [http://www.gpo.gov:80/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-23/pdf/CREC-2000-10-23-pt1-PgE1877-2.pdf Congressional Record E1877-8, October 23, 2000] expressed the wish "more could have been done" but said "progressive strides had been made." Representative Richard A. Baker (R-LA) (at H10448) bemoaned the "compromise" that had stripped the bill of "protections for swaps" He went on to announce he expected to work with Sen. Gramm "because it is evident these problems will not be solved on the House side." Although Representative Patrick J. Toomey (R-PA) stated that it was "a good bill" he said it was not a "perfect bill" and that he hoped "the other body will eliminate the remaining legal uncertainty that will still shadow the use of these transactions by retail customers. I hope that they will allow greater flexibility in the electronic trading of the over-the-counter derivatives." In the "rule suspension" discussion at H10411-15 (cited and linked in note 54 above) a "bipartisan" discontent was expressed by Representatives Sue Wilkins Myrick (R-NC) (at H10411) and Melvin Watt (D-NC) (at H10414-15) who criticized the removal of provisions in the House Banking Committee version of the bill that they thought better "protected" electronic trading platforms. This had special significance for the North Carolina based D&amp;I Holdings (as explained by Rep. Watt at H10414). At this time, Enron emails continued to report Sen. Gramm was the obstacle to H.R. 4541 being enacted into law. Lipton Enron Article (quoting an October 25, 2000, email from Kenneth M. Raisler to Tom Briggs of Enron, "explaining how Senator Gramm is holding up the legislation" and an October 27, 2000, email also from Mr. Raisler to Enron executives describing how "Senator Gramm is activiely engaged and his issues are being aggressively negotiated" after Gramm had "been contacted by a number of people including members of our Energy Group and Alan Greenspan urging passage of the bill.")

Gramm, followed by a report those negotiations had reached an impasse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbanker.com/article.html?id=20001211NMP3IJQM&amp;queryid=1314405268&amp;hitnum=7 Rob Garver, "Legislators Racing to Get Pro-Bank Swaps Bill Passed"], ''American Banker'', December 11, 2000; [http://www.americanbanker.com/article.html?id=200012120MHXM3VY&amp;queryid=1518318285&amp;hitnum=6 Miriam Eljas, "In Brief: Treasury Engaged in Talks on Swaps Bill"], ''American Banker'', December 12, 2000; [http://www.americanbanker.com/article.html?id=200012146PGBM5T3&amp;queryid=155358122&amp;hitnum=5 "Legislative Update"], ''American Banker'', December 14, 2000, ("Attempts to jump-start negotiations between the administration and congressional Republicans on the Commodity Futures Modernization Act appear to be failing...Democrats charge that under that plan [i.e. the Republican Senate plan to bar the CFTC from regulating "bank products"] futures exchanges could escape Futures Commission oversight by merging with a bank.

Gramm). Lipton Enron Article (which describes December 12, 2000, emails from Stacy Cary of ISDA showing "Mr. Gramm is being pressured to give in and sign off on the legislation, but he is still pushing for certain changes" and from Chris Long showing "Mr. Gramm was able to persuade the players to accept some modest amendments to the legislation, including a change that will further protect swaps from regulation, as he had long sought-a change that would benefit Enron." It is unclear what Mr. Long means in his email when he describes his "understanding from Treasury that the swap exemption is expanded slightly to say that if you are trading on a facility (MTF) and you are trading on principle-to-principle [sic] basis among eligible contract participants you are no longer subject anti-fraud and anti-manipulation as contained in Sec. 107 of the House passed legislation." As described in note 57 above and note 74 below, Section 107 of H.R. 4541 contained the same Section 2(h)(1) "bilateral swaps" exemption as Section 106 of H.R. 5660. Both applied the CEA's anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions to "eligible contract participants", but not the anti-fraud provisions to "principal to principal" transactions between "eligible commercial entities." Perhaps (1) an intervening draft of the legislation would have changed the Section 2(h)(1) provision from that in H.R. 4541, (2) the provision was further changed back to that in H.R. 4541 after Mr. Long's conversation, or (3) Mr. Long misunderstood what the Treasury Department told him.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 14, however, the Treasury Department announced agreement had been reached the night before and urged Congress to enact into law the agreed upon language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/ls1074.htm "Statement by Treasury Secretary Lawrence H.

Sen. Harkin noted (at S11896) he had worked to eliminate "an outright exclusion" for energy, preferring to continue "the substantial exemption" already provided by the CFTC, but that "further negotiations" brought "the provisions on this subject that are in this bill." He recognized "the need for compromise" given "the overall importance and positive features of this legislation." He also noted (at S11896) he had worked with Senator Lugar on the legislation and that Senators Gramm and Sarbanes had cooperated "in completing this bill." At S11897 he concluded by complementing Sen. Lugar, Rep. Ewing and "all staff involved for their outstanding work in making this important legislation a reality." Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-MD) did not speak on December 15, but when Congress returned on January 2, he noted the PWG's strong support for H.R. 5660 and introduced the version of the PWG letter addressed to him.

It describes (1) S. 2697 as a bill that "languished in the Senate, too controversial to get a committee hearing" (compare the hearing transcript and Senate Agriculture Committee Report in note 50 above); (2) H.R. 4541 as a bill passed in the evening in a House where "minority members" have less authority to alter legislation (compare the House proceedings described in notes 54 and 58 above, the lead up to those proceedings described throughout notes 54-58 above, and Rep. Maloney's call to not provide the 2/3 vote needed to consider H.R. 4541 under a "rule suspension" as described in note 74 below); (3) H.R. 4541 as held up in "the more deliberative Senate" until Sen. Gramm "ensured the bill would not be subject to floor debate" (compare the descriptions of Sen. Gramm activities in notes 53, 54, 58, and 60-63 above); and (4) the CFMA as the "same bill" re-introduced by Sen. Gramm on December 15 in "coordinated trickery" with Rep. Ewing "to get the entire bill attached to the appropriations bill" (compare with the lead up to the CFMA detailed in notes 58-63 above and the PWG letters and Congressional statements in note 69 above). While Sean Gonsalves and James Ridgeway relied on Blind Faith for the factual background they provided, the later cited references do not cite source materials other than David Corn citing a "congressional aide" in the quoted language from his article (compare that with the Congressional statements and other sources in notes 58-69 above) and Professor Greenberger citing Mr. Gonsalves in both of his referenced testimonies. Professor Greenberger also cites a 2002 Supplement to the predecessor edition of Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation. That citation supports the description of the CFMA as 262 page legislation. The 2002 Supplement at 3 (as cited by Greenberger) states "The Commodity Futures Modernization Act (CFMA) is a large document spanning 262 pages in bill form." The 2002 Supplement is out of print. Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation incorporates into its description of the CFMA most of the language of the 38 pages of description of the CFMA contained in the 2002 Supplement (which description begins on page 3 and ends on page 41 of the 2002 Supplement. Pages 43 through 155 contain the text of the CFMA, and pages 157 through 228 contain proposed CFTC rules to implement the trading facility provisions of the CFMA, as published at 66 Federal Register 14262 (March 9, 2001)). Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation at 314 states "The Commodity Futures Modernization Act (CFMA) is a large document consuming 262 pages." Sen. Gramm is not mentioned in either the 2002 Supplement or the description of the CFMA in Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation.

Similarly, in ''Infectious Greed'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=g2UsDJfHUocC&amp;pg=PA295 at 295] Professor Partnoy gives a broader depiction of the CFMA's origins than in the Partnoy Fresh Air Interview, as he mentions former SEC Chair Levitt's role in "overseeing" enactment of the CFMA. In Antonia Juhasz, ''The Tyranny of Oil'', (HarperCollins 2008) at 147-8, Antonia Juhasz states "Without any congressional hearings or debate, or any public notice, on December 12, 2000, Phil Gramm slipped what would forever be referred to as the "Enron Loophole" into the 262-page Commodity Futures Modernization Act, of which he was a sponsor. The act was then belatedly but quite suddenly attached to the 11,000-page omnibus appropriations bill that was passed into law by Congress and signed by President Clinton.") Although she provides no source for this information, other than the added detail that the "Enron Loophole" was added to the CFMA by Sen. Gramm on December 12, 2000, this account by Antonia Juhasz is consistent with the Juhasz Fresh Air Interview, the Blind Faith account, and the accounts that relied on Blind Faith.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Credit default swaps==

With the 2008 emergence of widespread concerns about [[credit default swap]]s, the CFMA's treatment of those instruments has become controversial. Title I of the CFMA broadly excludes from the CEA financial derivatives, including specifically any index or measure tied to a "credit risk or measure." In 2000, Title I's exclusion of financial derivatives from the CEA was not controversial in Congress. Instead, it was widely hailed for bringing "legal certainty" to this "important market" permitting "the United States to retain its leadership in the financial markets", as recommended by the PWG Report.&lt;ref&gt;June 19, 2000, House Agriculture Subcommittee Hearing. July 12, 2000, House Commerce Subcommittee Hearing. July 19, 2000, House Banking Committee Hearing. June 21, 2000, Joint Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees Hearing. Although the exclusions for financial OTC derivatives were not controversial at these hearings, at earlier 2000 hearings considering the PWG Report the issue was discussed, particularly whether a regulatory exemption would be better than a statutory exclusion. Senate Agriculture PWG Report Hearing at 9 (in describing what might happen if "you have a problem that crops up", Sen. Harkin states "if you have an exclusion, then it would take an act of Congress to do something about it.…if you have an exemption, then the CFTC could respond more readily to something like that." Treasury Secretary Summers responds: "you are clearly correct that an exemption provides more flexibility than an exclusion, but it is precisely the presence of that flexibility and the recognition that it might be used that undercuts legal certainty and creates a greater possibility that these transactions will take place and be booked abroad where they will not be subject to American law.") At the [http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/ag/hag10618.000/hag10618_0f.htm May 18, 1999, Hearing before the House Subcommittee on Risk Management, Research, and Specialty Crops concerning Reauthorization of the CFTC] in anticipation of the recommendations of the PWG Report, Patrick M. Parkinson, Associate Director, Division of Research and Statistics, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, spoke (at 130) about [[credit derivative]]s but dismissed price manipulation and "price discovery" concerns that have become central to critiques of credit default swaps: "some types of OTC contracts that have a limited deliverable supply, such as equity swaps and some credit derivatives, are growing in importance. However, unlike agricultural futures, for which failure to deliver has additional significant penalties, costs of failure to deliver in OTC derivatives are almost always limited to actual damages. Thus, manipulators attempting to corner a market, even if successful, would have great difficulty inducing sellers in privately negotiated transactions to pay significantly higher prices to offset their contracts or to purchase the underlying assets. Finally, the prices established in privately negotiated transactions are not used directly or indiscriminately as the basis for pricing other transactions. Counterparties in the OTC markets can be expected to recognize the risks to which they would be exposed by failing to make their own independent valuations of their transactions, whose economic and credit terms may differ in significant respects. Moreover, they usually have access to other, often more reliable or more relevant, sources of information on valuations. Hence, any price distortions in particular transactions would not affect other buyers or sellers of the underlying asset.")&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurance law issue===
The CFMA's treatment of credit default swaps has received the most attention for two issues. First, former New York Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo has argued credit default swaps should have been regulated as insurance and that the CFMA removed a valuable legal tool by preempting state "bucket shop" and gaming laws that could have been used to attack credit default swaps as illegal. In 1992, the FTPA had preempted those state laws for financial derivatives covered by the CFTC's "swaps exemption." As described in Section 1.1.2 above, however, a "gap" in the CFTC's powers prohibited it from exempting futures on "non-exempt securities." This "loophole" (which was intended to preserve the Shad-Johnson Accord's prohibition on single stock futures) meant that, before the CFMA, the CEA's preemption of state gaming and "bucket shop" laws would not have protected a credit default swap on a "non-exempt security" (i.e. an equity security or a "non-exempt" debt obligation that qualified as a "security"). As before 1992, the application of such state laws to a credit default swap (or any other swap) would depend upon a court finding the swap was a gambling, "bucket shop", or otherwise illegal transaction. As described in Section 1.2.1 above, legal uncertainty for security-based swaps was an important issue in the events that led to the PWG Report. The PWG Report recommended eliminating that uncertainty by excluding credit default swaps and all security-based swaps from the CEA and by adding to the "hybrid instrument" exemption an exclusion from the Shad-Johnson Accord.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Dinallo, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3b94938c-1d59-11de-9eb3-00144feabdc0.html?nclick_check=1 "We Modernized Ourselves into the Ice Age"], Financial Times, March 30, 2009 ("Dinallo FT Opinion") (stating "unregulated speculation" was a major cause of the bank panic of 1907, in reaction states passed "anti-bucket shop and gambling laws, outlawing the activity that helped to ruin the economy", and the CFMA "exempted credit default swaps from these laws" which meant "we might have avoided the worst of the current troubles if we had not overturned laws adopted in response to earlier crises.") For the PWG's recommendations to exclude from the CEA (and include in the CEA's preemption of state laws) OTC derivatives in "non-exempt securities" see PWG Report at 17 (for swaps) and at 29 (for hybrid instruments).&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Superintendent Dinallo has written that the CFMA was enacted in part to avoid having OTC derivatives transactions move offshore. He has not, however, addressed whether that could have been avoided if the CFMA had not been enacted. AIG (the insurance company addressed by Mr. Dinallo's commentary) located its controversial derivatives dealer (AIG Financial Products) in London and conducted its "regulatory CDS" transactions through a French bank (Banque AIG) because of the bank regulatory capital provision that banks (not AAA rated parties) received a reduced credit risk "weighting" for their obligations, including CDS, owed to other banks. General Re, the other insurance company with a very active derivatives dealer affiliate, similarly established that dealer in London.&lt;ref&gt;In the Dinallo FT Opinion former Insurance Superintendent Dinallo argues (1) "the fear in 2000 was that if we regulated credit default swaps and required holding sufficient capital, the market would go where unregulated sellers could make more money" and (2) banks bought credit default swaps from AIG covering "investments" held by the banks "to avoid regulation" because it allowed them to claim "they no longer had the risk of a default of the bond." It is difficult to understand how this applies to AIG (which is the company mentioned in the Dinallo FT Opinion) or what the "regulatory arbitrage" credit default swaps ("CDS") of AIG had to do with the CFMA. AIG Financial Products ("AIGFP"), before 2000 and after the CFMA became law, was located in London.

If US-based CDS counterparties of AIGFP were also internationally active (as the Morgenson Article suggests in noting the "'global swath' of top-notch entities" that" were counterparties to AIGFP CDS), they likely would have been able to book their CDS transactions with AIGFP through their own non-US offices to avoid the application of the CEA if the CFMA had not been enacted. See notes 23, 37, and 79 (Summers response to Harkin question at Senate Agriculture PWG Report Hearing) above for the issue of "offshore" booking of OTC derivatives. More clearly, the seller of AIG's "regulatory arbitrage" credit default swaps was Banque AIG, not an insurance company. See pages 133-134 of [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/5272/000095012309003734/y74794e10vk.htm AIG's 2008 Form 10-K Report] ("AIG 2008 10-K"). This is noted in the Morgenson Article. ("the London-based units…trades were routed through Banque A.I.G., a French institution"). As explained on page 133 of the AIG 2008 10-K, Banque AIG is a French bank regulated under French banking law. As also explained on page 133 of the AIG 2008 10-K, the "regulatory arbitrage" from those CDS was not because they were credit default swaps, but because they operated as guarantees from a bank in an OECD country (i.e. France). See also Daniel K. Tarullo, ''Banking on Basel: the future of international financial regulation'' (Peterson Institute 2008) for an explanation ([https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5nFJXzfsZ4C&amp;pg=PA57 at 57&amp;ndash;60)] of how the Basel I Accord (as described in the AIG 2008 10-K) established "generic" risk categories so "all loans to nonbanking corporations were risk-weighted at 100 percent" but all "claims on, or guaranteed by, banks incorporated in the OECD" were risk-weighted at 20%. In 1999 U.S. banking regulators reviewed multiple transaction structures similar to the AIGFP "regulatory arbitrage" CDS transactions and concluded a "super senior" exposure held by a bank that was guaranteed by the Banque AIG CDS (as depicted on page 133 of the AIG 2008 10-K) could receive a 20% "risk weighting" without being supported by a bank issued CDS or other form of bank guarantee if certain "stringent" conditions were met. [http://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/srletters/1999/sr9932a1.pdf Federal Reserve Board and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, "Capital Interpretations, Synthetic Collateralized Loan Obligations, November 15, 1999", Federal Reserve Board Supervisory Release 99-32]. ("US Synthetic CLO Interpretation"). To the extent the "stringent minimum requirements" described at pages 6-7 of the US Synthetic CLO Interpretation were met, this would eliminate the need to acquire such CDS. Under the US Synthetic CLO Interpretation, one important element was that an outside investor acquire an interest in the relevant loan pool that would be subordinate to the "super senior" exposure but still be rated AAA. This requirement is why the bank retained exposure is considered "super senior." As depicted on page 133 of the AIG 2008 10-K, this is the type of "super senior" exposure covered by the AIG "regulatory arbitrage" CDS. As the AIG 2008 10-K also explains at page 133 the implementation of Basel II eliminates the need for the Banque AIG "regulatory" CDS, because Basel II recognizes the low risk nature of the "super senior" exposure and requires corresponding capital, not a flat 8% requirement based on a "generic" capital requirement. U.S. banking regulators described in 1996 when CDS or other credit derivatives would operate as bank guarantees for purposes of capital rules and how the bank providing such a guarantee would be required to hold regulatory capital equal to that required if it directly held the guaranteed bond or other obligation.

Nevertheless, similar to the Dinallo FT Opinion, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/28/business/28nocera.html Joe Nocera, "Propping Up a House of Cards"], ''The New York Times'', February 28, 2009, describes AIG's "regulatory arbitrage" CDS by stating (1) it allowed "banks to make their balance sheet look safer than they really were" because of AIG's AAA rating (when the European banks acquiring the CDS protection received reduced regulatory capital requirements because the CDS represented an OECD country bank guarantee, regardless of the rating of that bank); (2) because the CDS "were not even categorized as a traditional insurance product, A.I.G. didn't have to put anything aside for losses" (when the regulatory capital requirement for the CDS would be determined by French banking law, not any insurance regulator, and the US banking regulators would have required regulatory capital equal to that required for the underlying exposure); (3) that this was only possible because a "misguided set of international rules that took hold toward the end of the 1990s" permitted banks "to use their own internal risk measurements to set their capital requirements" (when those "misguided" rules, known as Basel II, are what is ending the need for the "regulatory arbitrage" provided by the Banque AIG CDS, as described on page 133 of the 2008 AIG 10-K, and only the earlier Basel I standards provided the "generic" 20% risk-weighting for bank obligations, including bank guarantees.) For the location of General Re's derivatives dealer in London and the difficulties incurred by Berkshire Hathaway in winding down that dealer after it acquired General Re, see [http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=6097073 "General Re Securities Limited"], Business Week, Snapshot (click on Detailed Description for the 1991 UK incorporation) and [https://www.forbes.com/2003/05/09/cx_aw_0509derivatives.html Ari Weinberg, "The Great Derivatives Smackdown"], [[Forbes]], May 9, 2003, which contrasts the Alan Greenspan and Warren Buffett views of derivatives, mentions the shuttering of General Re Securities with a remaining derivatives book, and curiously refers to AIG's "extensive disclosures" and lists AIG FP's credit derivative disclosures.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Securities law issue===
Second, Title II of the CFMA treated credit default swaps tied to "securities" as "security-related swaps" for which the SEC was granted limited authority to enforce "insider trading", fraud, and anti-manipulation provisions of the securities laws. Before the CFMA, it was generally agreed most swaps were not securities, but the SEC had always maintained that swaps tied to securities were securities, particularly when such swaps could reproduce the attributes of owning the underlying security. In granting the SEC authority over "security-related swaps", the CFMA specifically prohibited applying any "prophylactic" anti-fraud or anti-manipulation measures. The SEC has complained this has prevented it from collecting information, and requiring disclosures, regarding credit default positions of investors. The SEC has argued this handicaps its ability to monitor possible manipulations of security markets through credit default swaps.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/2008/ts112008ers.htm Erik Sirri, Director, Division of Trading and Markets, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("Sirri"), Testimony Concerning Credit Default Swaps Before the House Committee on Agriculture], November 20, 2008; [https://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/2008/ts101508ers.htm Sirri, Testimony Concerning Credit Default Swaps Before the House Committee on Agriculture], October 15, 2008; [http://www.dechert.com/library/FS_39_12-08_Derivatives_Developments.pdf Dechert LLP, "Derivatives Developments: Tackling the $50 Trillion Credit Default Swap Market and Beyond"], December 2008; [http://www.pillsburylaw.com/siteFiles/Publications/7BB4BB854D928CE3F1C3705FD6D13CC8.pdf Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, "SEC Seeks to Regulate Credit Default Swaps"], November 10, 2008. The pre-CFMA status of swaps as "securities" under the securities laws is discussed in Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation at 12 to 13 ("Most commodities, and hence futures contracts, do not fall within the definition of ''security.''…In contrast to the typical raw material or bullion contract, if the underlying commodity is itself a security, such as with government bonds, the securities laws, on their face, would seem to apply."); Markham CF Law Treatise at 28-27 to 28-28 (describing a federal district court ruling finding an "equity swap" not to be a "security", which was overruled by a federal circuit court finding it was); James Hamilton, J.D., L.L.M., Kenneth R. Benson, J.D., Matthew W. Lisle, J.D., ''A Guide To Federal Regulation of Derivatives'', (Commerce Clearing House 1998) at 49 to 50 (describing how the "risk shifting" function of derivatives has been viewed as not meeting the "common enterprise and expectation of profits from the efforts of others" requirements established for defining "securities" given their "capital raising" function). ISDA CFMA Memo at 9-10 and 40-43 (describing at 41 how the CFMA provisions "effectively end any confusion about the status of swaps under the U.S. securities laws" and at 9-10 how the security law description of swaps adopted the new definition that the "material terms (other than price and quantity) are subject to individual negotiation" rather than the less stringent Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act definition that the swap be subject to individual negotiation, as described in notes 57 and 76 above). For the post-CFMA view of then SEC Commissioner Annette Nazareth, who was SEC Director. Division of Trading and Markets, at the time the CFMA was debated and passed by Congress, see [http://www.sechistorical.org/collection/oral-histories/nazareth110405Transcript.pdf "SEC Historical Society Interview with Annette Nazareth Conducted on November 4, 2005, by Kenneth Durr"] (at 19 to 22 describing the SEC's involvement with the CFMA and at 19 stating "while the whole package was quite deregulatory, there was some additional certainty that we were able to achieve with respect to derivatives that were securities-based swaps—securities-based swaps were subject to anti-fraud provisions. We thought it was clear but it was awfully good to get it in the legislation.")&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centralized clearing===
The SEC, the PWG, and others have also expressed concern about the "systemic risk" created by a lack of centralized clearing of credit default swaps. Although (as noted in Section 2 above) the CFMA created the possibility of centralized clearing by removing the pre-CFMA requirements that OTC derivatives not be subject to centralized clearing, the CFMA did not require such clearing, even for "standardized" transactions.&lt;ref&gt;See the two Sirri testimonies cited in note 82 above.

===Bankruptcy law issue===

==2009 Treasury Department proposed OTC derivatives legislation==

On August 11, 2009, the Treasury Department sent to Congress proposed legislation titled the "Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets Act of 2009." The Treasury Department stated that under this proposed legislation "the OTC derivative markets will be comprehensively regulated for the first time."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/tg261.htm Treasury Department News Release, "Administration's Regulatory Reform Agenda Reaches New Milestone: Final Piece of Legislative Language Delivered to Capitol Hill"], TG-261, August 11, 2009. The [http://www.financialstability.gov/docs/regulatoryreform/titleVII.pdf draft legislation titled "Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets Act of 2009"] (the "OCDMA").&lt;/ref&gt;
 
To accomplish this "comprehensive regulation", the proposed legislation would repeal many of the provisions of the CFMA, including all of the exclusions and exemptions discussed in Sections 4 above that have been identified as the "Enron Loophole." While the proposed legislation would generally retain the "legal certainty" provisions of the CFMA, it would establish new requirements for parties dealing in non-"standardized" OTC derivatives and would require that "standardized" OTC derivatives be traded through a regulated trading facility and cleared through regulated central clearing. The proposed legislation would also repeal the CFMA's limits on SEC authority over "security-based swaps."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sullcrom.com/files/Publication/44efa8dd-8bfd-4db7-a38f-3425e59fdf4f/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/85d1ad2b-d5b7-49c4-937f-3469a86a9d77/SC_Publication_Treasury_OTC_Derivatives_Legislative_Proposal.pdf Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP, "Treasury OTC Derivatives Legislative Proposal"], August 17, 2009; [http://www.ropesgray.com/files/Publication/3177a2d8-ef00-482c-b243-09d9214b0940/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/c8d36b74-1481-4ec8-940f-e74c3bffdfb7/RopesGray_Alert_US-Treasury-Increased-Federal-Regulation-of-OTC-Derivatives.pdf Ropes &amp; Gray LLP, "U.S. Treasury Proposes Bill for Increased Federal Regulation of OTC Derivatives"], August 14, 2009; [http://www.alston.com/financialmarketscrisisblog/blog.aspx?entry=2433 Alston+Bird LLP, "U.S. Treasury Delivers Proposed Legislation on OTC Derivatives to Congress"] August 12, 2009; [http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/financialsvcs_dem/otc_principles_final_7-30.pdf Representative Collin Peterson, Chairman House Agriculture Committee, Representative Barney Frank, House Financial Service Committee, Concept Paper, "Description of Principles for OTC Derivatives Legislation"], July 30, 2009. The proposed repeals of Sections 2(d), (e), (g) and (h) of the CEA can be found at 15 in Section 713(a) of the OCDMA. The proposed repeal of limits on SEC regulation of security-based swaps is at 72 in Section 752 of the OCDMA.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, 2009, the House passed H.R. 4173, the so-called Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009, which included a revised version of the Treasury Department's proposed legislation that would repeal the same provisions of the CFMA noted above. At that time, similar legislation was pending in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=a4qgYsRD8IVY&amp;pos=1# Alison Veshkin, "House Passes Rules for Wall Street Over Objections"], Bloomberg, December 11, 2009.

== Controversies ==

==="Enron Loophole"===

====Section 2(h) "loophole"====
The first provision of the CFMA to receive widespread popular attention was the "Enron Loophole".&lt;ref name="The Enron Loophole"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Enron Loophole|url=http://opencrs.com/document/RS22912/2008-07-07/|publisher=Open CRS}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most accounts, this "loophole" was the CEA's new section 2(h). Section 2(h) created two exemptions from the CEA for "exempt commodities" such as oil and other "energy" products.&lt;ref name="digital.library.unt.edu"&gt;[https://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs/permalink/meta-crs-10766:1 Mark Jickling, "The Enron Loophole", CRS Report for Congress RS22912], July 7, 2008 ("CRS Enron Loophole Report")&lt;/ref&gt;

First, any transaction in exempt commodities not executed on a "trading facility" between "eligible contract participants" (acting as principals) was exempted from most CEA provisions (other than fraud and anti-manipulation provisions). This exemption in Section 2(h)(1) of the CEA covered the "bilateral swaps market" for exempt "trading facilities."&lt;ref name="abanet.org"&gt;CRS Enron Loophole Report at CRS-2 to 3. Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation at 331 to 332. ISDA CFMA Memo at 29 to 30.  [http://www.abanet.org/buslaw/corporateresponsibility/clearinghouse/02annual/37/ervin.pdf Susan Ervin, "CFTC Regulation of Energy Derivatives: An Overview"] ("Ervin CFTC Energy Regulation") at 10. As explained in the referenced pages of the ISDA CFMA Memo and in Ervin CFTC Energy Regulation at 9, an "eligible commercial entity" ("ECE") was defined as an ECP that was not an individual or State or local government entity that, depending on the nature of the entity, had a specified "exposure" to the underlying commodity.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, any transaction in exempt commodities executed on an "electronic trading facility" between "eligible commercial entities" (acting as principals) was also exempted from most CEA provisions (other than those dealing with fraud and manipulation). The "trading facility", however, was required to file with the CFTC certain information and certifications and to provide trading and other information to the CFTC upon any "special call." This exemption in Section 2(h)(2) of the CEA covered the "commercial entities" for exempt "electronic trading facilities."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Johnson/Hazen Derivatives Regulation at 332. ISDA CFMA Memo at 30 to 31. Ervin CFTC Energy Regulation at 10&lt;/ref&gt;

While the language of Section 2(h) was in H.R. 4541 as passed by the House, the portion of Section 2(h) dealing with the exempt commercial market had been deleted from S. 2697 when the Senate Agriculture Committee reported out an amended version of that bill. H.R. 4541 served as the basis for Titles I and II of the CFMA.  The Senate Agriculture Committee's removal of the Section 2(h) language from S. 2697, however, served as the basis for later Senate concern over the origins of Section 2(h).&lt;ref&gt;For the removal of the exempt commercial market language from the Senate bill, see the Senate Agriculture S. 2697 Report at 9 ("although this exemption is limited to transactions between eligible contract participants that occur off a trading facility, the CFTC is encouraged to use its current exemptive authority, as appropriate and consistent with the public interest, under Section 4(c) of the CEA to exempt transactions between eligible contract participants that occur on an electronic trading facility.") The revised Senate Agriculture Committee Section 2(h)(1) language, which provided a broader exemption than the CFMA in not requiring that eligible contract participants ("ECPs") act as "principals", is at page 42 of the Senate Agriculture S. 2697 Report and at pages 159 to 161 of the [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:s2697rs.txt.pdf reported version of S. 2697], as Section 9. Section 5 of [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:s2697is.txt.pdf S. 2697 as introduced in the Senate] would have excluded from most CEA provisions electronic trading of all energy commodities (which, along with financial commodities, were defined as "Exclusion Eligible Commodities") by ECPs acting as principals . See pages 23 to 25 of the Senate Agriculture S. 2697 Report or pages 23 to 25 of S. 2697 as introduced in the Senate. For the later Senate Agriculture Committee recriminations concerning the "source" for Section 2(h)(3), see [http://www.access.gpo.gov/congress/senate/pdf/107hrg/86213.pdf Hearing before the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, "CFTC Regulation and Oversight of Derivatives", July 10, 2002] ("July 10, 2002, Senate Agriculture Hearing") at 2 (Senator Tom Harkin: "The final version of the legislation included in the omnibus appropriations bill differed from our committee bill regarding energy and metals derivatives markets. I supported the CFMA, although I had some concerns about its treatment of energy and metals. There is a statement I gave on the floor to which I would refer you that is in the Congressional Record regarding that, because I thought at the time it had a number of very positive features. On the whole, I thought it was a good bill, and I still think it is." As described in note 69 above, Sen. Harkin had entered a statement in the December 15, 2000, Congressional Record in support of H.R. 5660. He had noted his misgivings about its treatment of energy derivatives, but had recognized "the need to compromise." Although, as described in note 69 above, they had entered in the Congressional Record statements in support of H.R. 5660, Senators Fitzgerald and Lugar had not stated any misgivings about the bill's treatment of energy derivatives. At the July 10, 2002, hearing they joined Sen. Harkin in expressing dismay over the energy provisions of the CFMA (Sen. Fitzgerald at 9: "somehow, somewhere in the process, somebody slipped in this mysterious exemption for energy and metals trading" and at 58: "As we had it in Committee, it did not have that special carve-out and somehow… special carve-out came and it does not seem to have a father. No one can figure out who did it." Sen. Lugar at 11: "Somebody in the process of that conference talked about exemption of bilateral trade on electronic platforms, precisely the sort of thing that Enron was to be involved in…We all should have been brighter, perhaps, in reading the type, but nevertheless, that is the one that already occurred and that is why it is here.") None of Senators Harkin, Fitzgerald, or Lugar discussed at the hearing whether they thought S. 2697, which had never been voted on in the Senate and which was organized differently from H.R. 4541 and H.R. 5660, was the source for H.R. 5660, rather than H.R. 4541, which had passed the House and contained the same Section 2(h)(3) trading facility exemption as the CFMA. As described in note 78 below, CFTC Commissioner Thomas Erickson, who had been a critic of the CFMA back in 2000, explained Section 2(h) was not the "Enron Loophole" used by EnronOnline. At the [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=107_senate_hearings&amp;docid=f:79753.pdf January 29, 2002, Hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to Receive Testimony Concerning the Impact of the Enron Collapse on Energy Markets]("January 29, 2002, Senate Energy Hearing") the prepared testimony of [[Vincent Viola]], Chairman of NYMEX, which had "lobbied" against Section 2(h)(3) for exempting from the CEA energy and metals "futures contracts traded on electronic trading platforms from nearly all federal regulatory oversight", recounted (at 37) that lobbying effort and explained "Thankfully, Mr. Chairman [i.e. Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM)], you, Senator Charles Schumer, and Senators Richard Lugar and Tom Harkin (Attachment 3) with the Senate Agriculture Committee, as well as number of members of congress including Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, Congressmen Peter King, John Dingell, and others recognized the serious policy flaws with this extreme deregulatory measure, and quite courageously challenged Enron and others, preventing it from becoming law in its most draconian form." In his prepared testimony for the same hearing (at 63), Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) recalled that effort and stated "During the debate regarding the CFMA, I was greatly concerned about the similar effects that granting electronic trading facilities an exclusion from CFTC oversight would have had on the market, and fought hard against such an exclusion…There would have been no anti-market manipulation rules, among others, to protect the markets. Those of us who were concerned about the ramifications of an ETF exemption fought that provision and won." In Sen. Schumer's questioning (at 63-4) he elicited from NYMEX Chairman Viola (at 64) the statement "I think clearly the last minute efforts at sort of not having complete deregulation and exemption occur in the CFMA helped greatly in keeping markets stable…" As described above, at the July 10, 2002 Senate Agriculture Hearing, this Congressional involvement with Section 2(h)(3) was forgotten. Instead, in Sen. Fitzgerald's words, the "loophole' had "no father." In the House considerations of H.R. 4541, the Section 2(h) exemptions for "exempt commodities" was criticized by the CFTC at all three hearings on the bill and by House Floor statements of Representative Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) and, at E1879 of his "extended remarks" cited and linked in note 41 above, by Rep. Markey ("I also have some concerns with the breadth of the exemption in section 106 of this bill, and its potential anticompetitive and anticonsumer effects. There may be less anticompetitive ways to address an energy swaps exemption in a way that provides for fair competition and adequate consumer protections in this market. Such a result would be in the public interest. What is currently in the bill is not, and I would hope that it could be fixed as this bill moves forward.") On September 28, 2000, at [http://www.gpo.gov:80/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-09-28/html/CREC-2000-09-28-pt1-PgH8436.htm H8436, Congressional Record, September 28, 2000], Rep. Maloney called upon the House to block consideration of H.R. 4541 by refusing the necessary 2/3 vote for a rule "suspension" if the "energy provisions" were not given a "full hearing." She entered into the record on the same page a letter she had received from CFTC Chair William Rainer describing CFTC opposition to the provision expressed at all four Congressional hearings on H.R. 4541 and S. 2697.  On October 19, 2000, in supporting the required "rule suspension", Rep. Maloney stated (at [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2000_record&amp;page=H10412&amp;position=all Congressional Record, H10412, October 19, 2000]) that her concerns "had been addressed at least in part" but that "the provision could be further improved by deleting language that favors electronic trading facilities over traditional exchanges." Rep. Maloney's statements came after Rep. Leach entered (at [http://www.gpo.gov:80/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-19/pdf/CREC-2000-10-19-pt1-PgH10365.pdf Congressional Record, H10365, October 19, 2000]) a "Supplemental Report" from the House Banking Committee that showed as an "errata" to the Committee's earlier report a Committee vote of 20-12 defeating an amendment proposed by Rep. Maloney "to delete the provision providing a partial exclusion from the CEA for exempt commodities entered into solely between eligible contract participants and executed on an electronic trading facility." For the supplemental report see [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_reports&amp;docid=f:hr711p4.106.pdf House of Representative Report 106-711, Part 4].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Congress enacted into law over President Bush's veto an Omnibus Farm Bill that contained the "Close the Enron Loophole Act." This added to CEA Section 2(h)(2) a new definition of "electronic trading facility" and imposed on such facilities requirements applicable to fully regulated exchanges (i.e. "designated contract markets") such as the NYMEX. The legislation did not change Section 2(h)(1) exemption for the "bilateral swaps market" in exempt commodities.&lt;ref name="dechert.com"&gt;CRS Enron Loophole Report at CRS-4 to 6.

====Section 2(g) "loophole"====

Section 2(g) of the CEA is also sometimes called the "[[Enron Loophole]]". It is a broader exclusion from the CEA than the Section 2(h)(1) exemption for the "bilateral swaps market" in exempt commodities. It excludes from even the fraud and manipulation provisions of the CEA any "individually negotiated" transaction in a non-agricultural commodity between "eligible contract participants" not executed on a "trading facility." Thus, the exclusion from provisions of the CEA for "eligible contract participants" is broader than the Section 2(h)(1) exemption for "bilateral swaps" of energy commodities. The criteria for this exclusion, however, are narrower in requiring "individual negotiation."&lt;ref name="H.R. 4541, as passed by the House"&gt;Greenberger June 3, 2008, Senate Testimony at 7, fn. 28. [http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=show_mesg&amp;forum=389&amp;topic_id=3483029&amp;mesg_id=3483029 "The Enron Loophole has Closed and Goes Into Effect on September 30, 2009"], citing the Wikipedia article [[Enron Loophole]]. Ervin CFTC Energy Regulation at 11 (describing the 2002 "Feinstein Bill" that would repeal the Section 2(g) swaps exclusion, along with making other CFMA amendments.) The language of Section 2(g) was contained in Section 107 of [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h4541eh.txt.pdf H.R. 4541, as passed by the House], at page 47, as creating a new Section 2(h) of the CEA.  In the CFMA it was Section 105(b) of [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h5660ih.txt.pdf H.R. 5660] at page 40, as described in note 57 above. During House consideration of H.R. 4541 (as cited and linked in note 54 above), Rep. Dingell (at H10446) objected to this "redundant exclusion" but accepted its "strict' requirements, including the requirement that "each of the material economic terms of the swap must be individually negotiated." Although this was changed in Section 105(b) of H.R. 5660 to require only that the swap be "subject to individual negotiation by the parties", Rep. Dingell did not criticize this provision in his Floor statements on H.R. 5660 (as cited and linked in note 69 above). For the significance of Section 2(g) for energy contracts, see also ISDA CFMA Memo at 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

This exclusion was not contained in either H.R. 4541 or S. 2697 as introduced in Congress. The House Banking and Financial Services Committee added this provision to the amended H.R. 4541 it reported to the House. That language was included in H.R. 4541 as passed by the House. Its final version was modified to conform to the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] definition of "swap agreement." That definition requires that the swap be "individually negotiated." H.R. 4541 had required that each "material economic term" be individually negotiated.&lt;ref name="House Banking Committee Report"&gt;See [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_reports&amp;docid=f:hr711p2.106.pdf House Banking Committee Report] at 13 for Section 110, which would have added a new Section 2(i) to the CEA as the exclusion for "Swap Transactions" (defined to require that "the material economic terms" be "subject to individual negotiation.") See [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h4541eh.txt.pdf H.R. 4541 as passed by the House] at 47 for Section 107, which would have added a new Section 2(h) to the CEA as the exclusion for "Swap Transactions." See [http://www.cftc.gov/stellent/groups/public/@lrrulesandstatutoryauthority/documents/file/ogchr5660.pdf the CFMA] at 40 for Section 105(b), which created Section 2(g) of the CEA. See the [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ102.106.pdf Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act] at 58 for Section 206(b), which defines "swap agreement" to be "individually negotiated." For CEA Section 2(g)'s use of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley definition, see ISDA CFMA Memo at 27 to 28 and 39. Kloner CFMA at 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

2002 Senate hearings indicated CEA Section 2(h)(2) was not the"Enron Loophole" used by EnronOnline. That facility was not required to qualify as an "electronic trading facility" under Section 2(h)(2) of the CEA because Enron Online was only used to enter into transactions with Enron affiliates. There were not "multiple participants" on both the buy and sell sides of the trades. Whether such Enron-only trades were covered by the Section 2(h)(1) "bilateral swaps market" exemption for energy products or the broader Section 2(g) exclusion for swaps generally depended whether there was "individual negotiation."&lt;ref name="enronexplorer.com"&gt;At the July 10, 2002, Senate Agriculture Hearing, CFTC Commissioner Thomas Erickson, who had been a critic of the CFMA in 2000, explained Section 2(h)(3) was not the "Enron Loophole" used by EnronOnline. He suggested (at 17 to 18, 22 to 23, 25, 26, and 30 to 31) that the bulk of the OTC derivatives market used the 2(g) exclusion for "swaps" and that this was available to EnronOnline. See also Sen. Fitzgerald at 25 ("Enron Online and Intercontinental Exchange are just exempt by statute here with Section 2(g)") and page 48 for Professor Coffee's view. While the differences between Commissioner Erickson and CFTC Chair Newsome at the hearing (at 17 and at 30-31) were characterized as a "disagreement" over whether Section 2(g) "trumped" Section 2(h), Chairman Newsome states (at 17-18) that "swap transactions were excluded from our jurisdiction prior to the CFMA by administrative action of the CFTC and they were excluded after the CFMA by codification of Congress." He goes on to state Section 2(h) is not "trumped by the swap's exclusion for transactions in energy products that are not deemed to be swaps transactions." Thus, Chairman Newsome acknowledged Section 2(g) did "trump" Section 2(h) for swap transactions. While the 1993 swaps exemption exempted swaps from the CEA, as described in note 19 above, it did not exempt such transactions from the fraud and anti-manipulation provisions of the CEA to the extent the transactions were "futures" under the CEA. The CFMA granted an exclusion from such provisions. Further testimony at the July 10, 2002, Senate Agriculture Hearing (at 57) explained the Section 2(g) exclusion would apply to "online" transactions in which after agreeing to price the parties would "go offline" and "negotiate the credit terms." This type of transaction would be eligible for the Section 2(g) exclusion if it dealt with either an excluded or an exempt commodity. The Section 2(h)(1) exemption for "bilateral swaps" would be available if the two parties completed their "private" transaction online without "individual negotiation" but without both the offer and acceptance being available to multiple parties. This is the way Enron OnLine is usually described as having operated, because Enron was always a party to each transaction. ''Infectious Greed'' at 320 (‘its trades were judged to be ‘bilateral contracts' between the two parties trading on Enron's website"). At the January 29, 2002 Senate Energy Hearing, Chairman Bingaman explained (at 1 to 2) "EnronOnline did not match buyers and sellers. It contracted with each separately, so that Enron was on the other side of every deal." See also the prepared statement of Patrick Woods, III, Chairman, Fedederal Energy Regulatory Commission, at 14 ("EnronOnline uses a one-to-many trading format, where an Enron affiliate is always on one side of each energy transaction, either as a seller or a buyer. The price of a commodity or derivative on EnronOnline is determined when a buyer or a seller accepts an offer or bid price posted by an Enron trader." In contrast, Chairman Woods describes the Intercontinental Exchange ("ICE") as a "many-to-many platform." A [http://www.enronexplorer.com/focus/19185#focus=/focus/338694/page/6&amp;lightbox=/show_email/89443&amp; December 16, 2000, email from Chris Long of Enron] indicated Enron was aware it would need to change EnronOnline to have Section 2(h)(3) apply to it. (in describing Section 2(f) the email states "This exemption could facilitate expansion of EnronOnline to allow for multi-party transactions, however certain legal requirements will have to be met.").&lt;/ref&gt;

===Food prices===

Institutions such as [[hedge fund]]s, [[pension fund]]s and [[investment bank]]s&lt;ref name="Ind"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-real-hunger-games-how-banks-gamble-on-food-prices--and-the-poor-lose-out-7606263.html | title=The real hunger games: How banks gamble on food prices – and the poor lose out | publisher=The Independent | accessdate=April 1, 2012 | first=Grace | last=Livingstone | date=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been instrumental in pushing up world food prices in the last five years, with investment in food solely as a commodity rising from $65bn to $126bn (£41bn to £79bn) between 2007 and 2012, contributing to 30-year highs. Financial institutions now make up 61% of all investment in [[wheat]] futures. According to [[Olivier De Schutter]], the UN special rapporteur on food, there was a rush by institutions to enter the food market following the Commodity Futures Modernization Act.&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt;

De Schutter told the ''Independent'' in March 2012: &lt;blockquote&gt;What we are seeing now is that these financial markets have developed massively with the arrival of these new financial investors, who are purely interested in the short-term monetary gain and are not really interested in the physical thing – they never actually buy the ton of wheat or [[maize]]; they only buy a promise to buy or to sell. The result of this financialisation of the commodities market is that the prices of the products respond increasingly to a purely speculative logic. This explains why in very short periods of time we see prices spiking or bubbles exploding, because prices are less and less determined by the real match between supply and demand.&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In 2011, 450 economists from around the world called on the [[G20]] to regulate the commodities market more.&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt; Rising food prices over recent years have been linked with social unrest around the world, including rioting in Bangladesh and Mexico,&lt;ref name="Ind"/&gt; and the [[Arab Spring]].

===Bill Clinton===
In June 2013, film producer [[Charles Ferguson (filmmaker)|Charles Ferguson]] interviewed Bill Clinton who said he and Larry Summers couldn't change Alan Greenspan's mind and Congress then passed the Act with a veto-proof supermajority. Ferguson revealed that this was inaccurate and, he said, a lie, while commenting that he thought Clinton was "a really good actor". In fact, Ferguson wrote, the Clinton Administration and Larry Summers lobbied for the Act and joined Robert Rubin in both privately and publicly attacking advocates of regulation.&lt;ref name="ClintonHufPo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charles-ferguson/hillary-clinton-documentary_b_4014792.html | title=Why I Am Cancelling My Documentary on Hillary Clinton | publisher=Huffington Post | date=30 September 2013 | accessdate=1 March 2015 | author=Ferguson, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Common Penny''' ({{lang-de|Gemeiner Pfennig}} or ''Reichspfennig'') was an [[imperial tax]] (''Reichssteuer'') that was agreed at the instigation of [[Maximilian I (HRR)|Maximilian I]] in 1495 at the [[Diet of Worms (1495)|Diet of Worms]], in order to give the [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]] the means to wage [[Italian Wars|war against France]] and [[Turkish Wars|against the Osman regime]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. 

The tax was to be paid by all subjects of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation]] aged 15 years or more. It was designed as a [[Tax per head|poll tax]], [[income tax]] and [[property tax]] that depended on personal status and wealth. Its recovery ran into so many difficulties everywhere that it was explicitly abandoned in 1505. After the Hussite Penny (''Hussitenpfennig'') in 1427, it was another attempt to introduce an imperial tax and was part of the comprehensive, but ultimately unsuccessful [[Imperial Reform]] under Emperor Maximilian. The successor of the Common Penny as an imperial tax was the [[Kammerzieler]].

The '''Connecticut River''' is the longest river in the [[New England]] region of the [[United States]], flowing roughly southward for {{convert|406|mi}} through four states. It rises at the U.S. border with [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], and discharges at [[Long Island Sound]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/essex/features/essex_around_world/essex_connecticut.shtml| author=Linda Brughelli| title=Essex - Connecticut| work=BBC Local: Essex| date=October 28, 2014| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its watershed encompasses five U.S. states and one Canadian province, {{convert|11260|sqmi}} via 148 tributaries, 38 of which are major rivers.&lt;ref name="ctriver.org"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ctriver.org/river-resources/about-our-rivers/watershed-facts/| title=Watershed Facts| publisher=Connecticut River Watershed Council| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It produces 70% of Long Island Sound's fresh water, discharging at {{convert|19600|cuft|m3}} per second.&lt;ref name="ctriver.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environmentalheadlines.com/ct/2009/09/28/event-annual-source-to-sea-cleanup-on-ct-river-courant-com/|title=Event: Source To Sea Cleanup To Benefit 410 Miles of Connecticut River — Courant.com – CT Environmental Headlines|publisher=Environmentalheadlines.com|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Connecticut River Valley is home to some of the northeastern United States' most productive farmland, as well as a metropolitan region of approximately two million people surrounding [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] and [[Hartford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="connecticutriver.us"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://connecticutriver.us/site/content/about-river| title=About the River| website=Connecticutriver.us| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word "Connecticut" is a French corruption of the [[Mohegan]] word ''quinetucket'', which means "beside the long, tidal river".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/Connecticut/name_origin_CT.html|title=Connecticut State Name Origin|publisher=Statesymbolsusa.org|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word came into English during the early 1600s to name the river, which was also called simply "The Great River".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/30/nyregion/theater-the-industrialization-of-the-great-river-new-england-s-longest.html| author=Alberta Eiseman| title=THEATER; The Industrialization of the Great River, New England's Longest| date=August 30, 1998| newspaper=The New York Times| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-1614–1637: American Indian populations===
Prior to [[Netherlands|Dutch]] exploration beginning in 1614, numerous indigenous tribes lived throughout the fertile Connecticut River valley. Information concerning how these tribes lived and interacted stems mostly from English accounts written during the 1630s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dickshovel.com/peq.html| title=Pequot History| date=July 15, 1997| publisher=Dickshovel.com| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pequots]] dominated a territory in the southernmost region of the Connecticut River valley, stretching roughly from the river's mouth at [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut]] northward to just below the Big Bend at [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]]. They warred with and attempted to subjugate neighboring agricultural tribes such as the [[Niantic people|Western Niantics]], while maintaining an uneasy stand-off with their rivals the [[Mohegans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.colonialwarsct.org/1637.htm| title=1637 – The Pequot War| publisher=The Society of Colonial Wars in the State of Connecticut| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mattabesset]] (Tunxis) tribe takes its name from the place where its [[sachem]]s ruled at the Connecticut River's Big Bend at Middletown, in a village sandwiched between the territories of the aggressive Pequots to the south and the more peaceable Mohegans to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dickshovel.com/matta.html| title=Mattabesic History| date=November 15, 1997| publisher=Dickshovel.com| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mohegans dominated the region due north, where Hartford and its suburbs sit, particularly after allying themselves with the Colonists against the Pequots during the [[Pequot War]] of 1637.&lt;ref name="http://www.dickshovel.com/moh.html"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dickshovel.com/moh.html| title=Mohegan History| publisher=Dickshovel.com| date=July 14, 1997| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their culture was similar to that of the Pequots, as they had split off from them and become their rivals some time prior to European exploration of the area.&lt;ref name="http://www.dickshovel.com/moh.html"/&gt; The agricultural [[Pocomtuc]] tribe lived in unfortified villages alongside the Connecticut River north of the [[Enfield Falls]] on the fertile stretch of hills and meadows surrounding [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. The Pocomtuc village of Agawam&lt;ref&gt;Meaning "landing place" or "place for unloading canoes."&lt;/ref&gt; eventually became Springfield, situated on the Bay Path where the Connecticut River meets the western [[Westfield River]] and eastern [[Chicopee River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://archive.org/stream/indianplacenames00hude/indianplacenames00hude_djvu.txt| title=Full text of "Indian place names of New England"| publisher=Archive.org| accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pocomtuc villagers at Agawam helped [[Puritan]] explorers settle this site and remained friendly with them for decades, unlike tribes farther north and south along the Connecticut River.&lt;ref name="greattrailsbsa.typepad.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://greattrailsbsa.typepad.com/pocumtuc/2008/10/we-have-a-new-l.html| title=We Have A New Lodge!!!!!| date=October 9, 2008| publisher=Pocumtuc Lodge – Western Massachusetts Council, Boy Scouts of America| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dickshovel.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dickshovel.com/pocu.html| title=Pocumtuc History| publisher=Dickshovel.com| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region stretching from Springfield north to the [[New Hampshire]] and [[Vermont]] state borders fostered many agricultural Pocomtuc and [[Nipmuc]] settlements, with its soil enhanced by sedimentary deposits. Occasionally, these villages endured invasions from more aggressive confederated tribes living in [[New York (state)|New York]], such as the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], [[Mahican]], and [[Iroquois]] tribes.&lt;ref name="greattrailsbsa.typepad.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dickshovel.com"/&gt;

The [[Pennacook]] tribe mediated many early disagreements between colonists and other Indian tribes, with a territory stretching roughly from the [[Massachusetts]] border with Vermont and New Hampshire, northward to the rise of the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] in New Hampshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dickshovel.com/penna.html| title=Pennacook History| publisher=Dickshovel.com| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Western [[Abenaki]] ([[Sokoki]]) tribe lived in the [[Green Mountains]] region of Vermont but wintered as far south as the [[Northfield, Massachusetts]] area. They later merged with members of other [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] tribes displaced by wars and famines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dickshovel.com/aben.html| title=Abenaki| publisher=Dickshovel.com| accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1614–1636: Dutch and Puritan settlement===
In 1614, [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]] explorer [[Adriaen Block]] became the first European to chart the Connecticut River, sailing as far north as [[Enfield Falls Canal|Enfield Rapids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jIKKZck2ywoC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;dq=adrien+block+enfield+rapids&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xPdozfBBGA&amp;sig=Qjm0HHKWO1NhzejOoFxxpAFQnOI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=d9VkUseeKpaw4APo54GoAQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=adrien%20block%20enfield%20rapids&amp;f=false| author=Al Braden| title=The Connecticut River: A Photographic Journey Into the Heart of New England| publisher=Wesleyan University Press| date=March 1, 2010| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called it the "Fresh River" and claimed it for the Netherlands as the northeastern border of the [[New Netherland]] colony. In 1623, Dutch traders constructed a fortified trading post at the site of [[Hartford, Connecticut]] called the ''Fort Huys de Hoop'' ("Fort House of Hope").&lt;ref name="newnetherlandinstitute.org"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/digital-exhibitions/a-tour-of-new-netherland/connecticut/house-of-hope/| title=House of Hope| publisher=New Netherland Institute| work=A Tour of New England: Connecticut| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four separate [[Puritans|Puritan]]-led groups also settled the fertile Connecticut River Valley, and they founded the two large cities that continue to dominate the Valley today: Hartford (est. 1635) and Springfield (est. 1636). The first group of pioneers left the [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1632 and ultimately founded the village of Matianuck (which became [[Windsor, Connecticut]]) several miles north of the Dutch fort. A group left the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] from [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]], seeking a site where they could practice their religion more freely. With this in mind, they founded [[Wethersfield, Connecticut]] in 1633, several miles south of the Dutch fort at Hartford.
[[Image:Cole Thomas The Oxbow (The Connecticut River near Northampton 1836).jpg|left|thumb|225px|''View from Mount Holyoke, Northampton, Massachusetts, after a Thunderstorm—The Oxbow'' (1836) by [[Thomas Cole]]]]
In 1635, Reverend [[Thomas Hooker]] led settlers from [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], where he had feuded with Reverend [[John Cotton (minister)|John Cotton]], to the site in Connecticut of the Dutch Fort House of Hope, where he founded Newtowne.&lt;ref name="newnetherlandinstitute.org"/&gt; Shortly after Hooker's arrival, Newtowne annexed Matianuck based on laws articulated in Connecticut's settlement charter, the Warwick Patent of 1631. The patent, however, had been physically lost, and the annexation was almost certainly illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://libguides.ctstatelibrary.org/c.php?g=228022&amp;p=1595653| title=The Warwick Patent| work=Colonial Records &amp; Topics| publisher=CT State Library| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth English settlement along the Connecticut River came out of a 1635 scouting party commissioned by [[William Pynchon]] to find the most advantageous site for commerce and agriculture, hoping to found a city there. His scouts located the Pocumtuc village of Agawam, where the Bay Path trade route crossed the Connecticut River at two of its major tributaries—the Chicopee River to the east and Westfield River to the west—and located just north of Enfield Falls, the river's first unnavigable waterfall. Pynchon surmised that traders using any of these routes would have to dock and change ships at his site, thereby granting the settlement a commercial advantage.&lt;ref name="Barrows 1911"&gt;{{cite book|last = Barrows|first = Charles Henry|title=The history of Springfield in Massachusetts for the young: being also in some part the history of other towns and cities in the county of Hampden | publisher = The Connecticut Valley Historical Society | year = 1911 | pages=46–48 | id= US 13459.5.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially named Agawam Plantation and was allied with the settlements to the south that became the state of Connecticut, but it switched allegiances in 1641 and was renamed Springfield in honor of Pynchon's native town in England.&lt;ref name="Barrows 1911"/&gt;

Of these settlements, Hartford and Springfield quickly emerged as powers. In 1641, Springfield splintered off from the Hartford-based Connecticut Colony, allying itself with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. For decades, Springfield remained the Massachusetts Bay Colony's westernmost settlement, on the northern border of the Connecticut Colony. By 1654, however, the success of these English settlements rendered the Dutch position untenable on the Connecticut River. A treaty moved the boundary westward between the Connecticut Colony and New Netherland Colony to a point near [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. The treaty allowed the Dutch to maintain their trading post at Foot Huys de Hoop, which they did until the 1664 British takeover of New Netherland.

===Border disputes===
The Connecticut River Valley's central location, fertile soil, and abundant natural resources made it the target of centuries of border disputes, beginning with Springfield's defection from the Connecticut Colony in 1641, which brought the Massachusetts Bay Colony to the river.  Conflicting royal treaties of 1764 sparked the river's east-siders to unite with [[Ethan Allen]] and the west-siders against [[New York (state)|New York]] and the British. The [[1783 Treaty of Paris]] created a disputed border with Canada from the Connecticut's "northernmost headwaters". A 1933 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision settled a contentious boundary dispute&lt;ref&gt;State of Vermont v. State of New Hampshire https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/289/593&lt;/ref&gt; between Vermont and New Hampshire. The Connecticut River's history is characterized by both political intrigue and technological innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://bigstory.ap.org/content/no-border-dispute-here-vt-nh-reaffirm-boundary| title=No border dispute here: Vt., NH reaffirm boundary| date=March 14, 2012| work=The Big Story| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1640 and 1641, two controversies took place that altered the political boundaries of the Lower Connecticut River region, preventing it from administration by a single political body. The Connecticut Colony administered Springfield during the 1630s, in addition to Hartford, Wethersfield, and Windsor; however, by 1640, Springfield's advantageous geography enabled it to become the Connecticut Colony's most commercially prosperous settlement. The Colony endured a crippling grain shortage during the spring of 1640 which caused many cattle to die of starvation. The grain shortage became a matter of survival for the Colony but not for Springfield, due to its prosperity.&lt;ref name="Barrows 1911" /&gt;
[[File:Memorial Bridge, Springfield MA.jpg|225px|thumb|left|The [[Memorial Bridge (Massachusetts)|Memorial Bridge]] across the Connecticut River at [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], the river's largest city]]

In response to the shortage, leading citizens of Wethersfield and Hartford gave power to Pynchon, Springfield's founder, to purchase corn for all of the Connecticut Colony's settlements from the Pocumtuc. Colony leaders authorized him to offer large sums of money to the Indians, far above market prices; however, the Indians refused to sell at even "reasonable" prices, and thus he refused to buy the corn altogether. Pynchon argued that it was best not to broadcast the Connecticut Colonists' weaknesses to the Indians, who he believed might capitalize on it; likewise, he aimed to keep market values and trade with the Indians steady in the future.&lt;ref name="Barrows 1911" /&gt;

Hartford's leading citizens were furious with Pynchon's willingness to further imperil the starving settlements. With Windsor's and Wethersfield's consent, they commissioned [[John Mason (c. 1600–1672)|Captain John Mason]] who had fought in the Pequot War to travel to Springfield with "money in one hand and a sword in the other" to make a deal with the Indians, and also to rebuke Pynchon.&lt;ref name="Barrows 1911"/&gt; On reaching Springfield, Mason threatened the Indians with war if they did not sell their corn at reasonable prices. The Indians capitulated and ultimately sold the corn to the Colonists. However, Mason's violent approach aroused distrust among the [[Pocumtuc]] tribe. Mason also upbraided Pynchon in public.&lt;ref name="Barrows 1911"/&gt; This incident arose partly from differences of opinion regarding how to interact with the Indian tribes. Pynchon had achieved mutual benefits by trading with the Pocumtucs, whereas Mason had used force. Nevertheless, it caused Springfield's settlers to rally around the humiliated Pynchon, and led to the settlement severing ties with the Connecticut Colony.&lt;ref name="Barrows 1911" /&gt;

As this controversy was heating up, the Massachusetts Bay Colony saw an opportunity to gain a foothold along the fertile Connecticut River Valley. In 1640, Boston asserted a claim to jurisdiction over lands surrounding the river; however, Springfield remained politically independent until tensions with the Connecticut Colony were exacerbated by a final confrontation later that year.&lt;ref name="Barrows 1911" /&gt;

Hartford kept a fort at the mouth of the Connecticut River at [[Saybrook Colony|Old Saybrook]] for protection against the Pequots, [[Wampanoags]], Mohegans, and the New Netherland Colony. After Springfield broke ties with the Colony, the remaining Connecticut settlements demanded that Springfield's ships pay tolls when passing the mouth of the river. The ships refused to pay this tax without representation at Connecticut's fort, but Hartford refused to grant it. In response, the Massachusetts Bay Colony solidified its friendship with Springfield by levying a toll on Connecticut Colony ships entering [[Boston Harbor]]. Connecticut was largely dependent on sea trade with Boston and therefore permanently dropped its tax on Springfield, but Springfield allied with Boston nonetheless, drawing the first state border across the Connecticut River.&lt;ref name="Barrows 1911" /&gt;

The [[Fort at Number 4]] in [[Charlestown, New Hampshire]] was the northernmost English settlement on the Connecticut River until the end of the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763. Abenaki Indians resisted British attempts at colonization, but Colonists began settling north of [[Brattleboro, Vermont]] following the war.&lt;ref name="flowofhistory.org"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.flowofhistory.org/es_toolkit/essays/2why.html| title=Why did settlers come to New Hampshire and Vermont, and where did they come from?| work=Teaching Early Settlement| publisher=Flowofhistory.org (Southeast Vermont Community Learning Collaborative)| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Settlement of the Upper Connecticut River Valley increased quickly, with population assessments of 36,000 by 1790.&lt;ref name="flowofhistory.org"/&gt;

The area that is now Vermont was claimed by both New Hampshire and [[Province of New York|New York]], and was settled primarily through the [[New Hampshire Grants|issuance of land grants]] by New Hampshire Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] beginning in the 1740s.&lt;ref&gt;Wardner, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; New York protested these grants, and King [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] decided in 1764 that the border between the provinces should be the western bank of the Connecticut River.&lt;ref&gt;Wardner, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Ethan Allen, the [[Green Mountain Boys]], and other residents of the disputed area resisted attempts by New York to exercise authority over the area, which resulted in the establishment of the independent [[Vermont Republic]] in 1777&lt;ref&gt;Wardner, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; and its eventual accession to the United States in 1791 as the fourteenth state.&lt;ref&gt;Van de Water, Frederic. ''The Reluctant Republic'', New York: John Day, 1941. p. 337&lt;/ref&gt; Boundary disputes between Vermont and New Hampshire lasted for nearly 150 years and were finally settled in 1933, when the U.S. Supreme Court [[Vermont v. New Hampshire|reaffirmed King George's boundary]] as the ordinary low-water mark on the Vermont shore. In some places, the state line is now inundated by the impoundments of dams built after this time.&lt;ref name="crjc.org" /&gt;

===The Treaty of Paris and the 19th century===
The [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] that ended the [[American Revolutionary War]] created a new international border between New Hampshire and the [[Province of Canada]] at "northwesternmost headwaters of the Connecticut". Several streams fit this description, and thus a boundary dispute led to the short-lived [[Indian Stream Republic]], which existed from 1832 to 1835.

The broad, fertile Connecticut River Valley attracted agricultural settlers and colonial traders to Hartford, Springfield, and the surrounding region. The high volume and numerous falls of the river led to the rise of industry along its banks during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The cities of Springfield and Hartford in particular became centers of innovation and "intense and concentrated prosperity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.info/springfield.ma/description.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203182336/http://www.mass.info/springfield.ma/description.htm|date=December 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Enfield Falls Canal was opened in 1829 to circumvent shallows around Enfield Falls, and the locks built for this canal gave their name to the town of [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.our-oxford.info/other-history/W-locks.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926100919/http://www.our-oxford.info/other-history/W-locks.htm|date=September 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Connecticut River Valley functioned as America's hub of technical innovation into the 20th century, particularly the cities of Springfield and Hartford, and thus attracted numerous railroad lines. The proliferation of the railroads in Springfield and Hartford greatly decreased the economic importance of the Connecticut River. From the late 1800s until today, it has functioned largely as a center of wildlife and recreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://ctriverbyways.org/environment-and-geography| title=Environment &amp; Geography: Written in the Rocks and Sand| publisher=Connecticut River Byway Council|accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Log drives and the early 20th century===
[[File:The Oxbow, Connecticut River c 1910.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[The Oxbow (Connecticut River)|The Oxbow]], Connecticut River, circa 1910]]
Starting about 1865,&lt;ref name=vnj1304/&gt; the river was used for massive [[Log driving|logging drives]] from [[Third Connecticut Lake]] to initially [[water power]]ed [[sawmill]]s near Enfield Falls. Trees cut adjacent to tributary streams including [[Perry Stream]] and [[Indian Stream]] in [[Pittsburg, New Hampshire]], [[Halls Stream]] on the [[Quebec]]–New Hampshire border, [[Simms Stream]], the [[Mohawk River (New Hampshire)|Mohawk River]], and the [[Nulhegan River]] basin in [[Essex County, Vermont]], would be flushed into the main river by the release of water impounded behind [[splash dam]]s. Several log drivers died trying to move logs through Perry Falls in Pittsburg. Teams of men would wait at [[Canaan, Vermont]], to protect the bridges from log jams. Men guided logs through a {{convert|400|ft|adj=on}} drop along the length of Fifteen-Mile Falls&lt;ref name=vnj1304&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Helen |last=Pike |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=April 2013 |title=Spring Log Drives Through Fifteen-Mile Falls |journal=Vermont's Northland Journal |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=20–21 |id= |url= |accessdate=|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (now submerged under [[Moore Reservoir|Moore]] and [[Comerford Reservoir|Comerford]] reservoirs), and through Logan's Rips at Fitzdale, Mulligan's Lower Pitch, and Seven Islands. The [[White River (Vermont)|White River]] from Vermont and [[Ammonoosuc River]] from New Hampshire brought more logs into the Connecticut. A [[log boom]] was built between [[Wells River, Vermont]], and [[Woodsville, New Hampshire]], to hold the logs briefly and release them gradually to avoid jams in the Ox Bow. Men detailed to this work utilized Woodsville's saloons and [[red-light district]].&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the logs were destined for mills in [[Wilder, Vermont|Wilder]] and [[Bellows Falls, Vermont]], while others were sluiced over the Bellows Falls dam. [[North Walpole, New Hampshire]], contained twelve to eighteen saloons, patronized by the log drivers.&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook p.70&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mount Tom (Massachusetts)|Mount Tom]] was the landmark the log drivers used to gauge the distance to the final mills near [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Yankee Loggers |author=[[Stewart Holbrook|Holbrook, Stewart H.]] |publisher=International Paper Company |year=1961 |pages=63–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; These spring drives were stopped after 1915, when pleasure boat owners complained about the hazards to navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Wheeler, Scott |title = The History of Logging in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom | publisher = The Kingdom Historical |date=September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final drive included 500 workers controlling 65 million feet of logs.&lt;ref name=vnj1304/&gt; A final pulp drive consisted of 100,000 cords of four-foot logs in 1918. This was to take advantage of the wartime demand.&lt;ref name=vnj1304/&gt;

===The flood of 1936===
In March 1936, due to a winter with heavy snowfall, an early spring thaw and torrential rains, the Connecticut River flooded, overflowing its banks, destroying numerous bridges and isolating hundreds of people who had to be rescued by boat.

The dam at [[Vernon, Vermont]], was topped by {{convert|19|ft|m}}. Sandbagging by the National Guard and local volunteers helped prevent the dam's powerhouse from being overwhelmed, despite blocks of ice breaking through the upstream walls.&lt;ref name="wgby"&gt;{{cite video | first = Ed | last = Klekowski | first2 = Elizabeth | last2 = ilda | first3 = Libby | last3 = Klekowski | year = 2003 | title = The Great Flood of 1936: The Connecticut River Story | url = http://www.wgby.org/localprograms/flood/ | medium = DVD | language =  | trans_title =  | publisher = WGBY | location = [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] | rchiveurl =  | archivedate = 2011-09-30 | accessdate = 16 November 2011 | time = 02:10 | id =  | isbn =  | oclc = 58055715 | quote =  | ref =  | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110930222247/http://wgby.org/localprograms/flood/ | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], looting during the flood became a problem, causing the mayor of the city to deputize citizen patrols to protect flooded areas. Over 3,000 refugees from the area were housed in [[Amherst College]] and the [[Massachusetts State Agricultural College]] (now [[UMass Amherst]]).

Unprecedented accumulated ice jams compounded the problems created by the flood, diverting water into unusual channels and damming the river, raising water levels even further. When the jam at [[Hadley, Massachusetts]], gave way, the water crest overflowed the dam at Holyoke, overwhelming the sandbagging there. The village of [[South Hadley Falls, Massachusetts|South Hadley Falls]] was essentially destroyed, and the southern parts of Holyoke were severely damaged, with 500 refugees.

In Springfield, Massachusetts, {{convert|5|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, and {{convert|18|mi|km}} of streets, were flooded, and 20,000 people lost their homes. The city lost power, and nighttime looting caused the police to issue a "shoot on sight" edict; 800 National Guard troops were brought in to help maintain order. Rescue efforts using a flotilla of boats saved people trapped in upper stories of buildings, bringing them to local fraternal lodges, schools, churches and monasteries for lodging, medical care, and food. The [[American Red Cross]] and local, state and Federal agencies, including the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] and the [[Civilian Conservation Corps|CCC]], contributed aid and manpower to the effort. Flooding of roads isolated the city for a time. When the water receded, it left behind silt-caused mud which in places was {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} thick; the recovery effort in Springfield, at the height of the American [[Great Depression]], took approximately a decade.

Overall, the flood caused 171 deaths and [[United States dollar|US$]]500 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500000000|1936|r=-8}}}} with inflation{{Inflation-fn|US}}) in damages. Across the northeast, over 430,000 people were made homeless or destitute by flooding that year.&lt;ref&gt;Klelowski, Ed. ''The Great Flood of 1936: The Connecticut River Valley Story'' [[WGBY]] (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Connecticut River Flood Control [[interstate compact|Compact]] between the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont was established in 1953 to help prevent serious flooding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-67/pdf/STATUTE-67-Pg45.pdf| format=PDF| title=Connecticut River Flood Control Compact| date=June 6, 1953| publisher=US Government Printing Office| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1936–present: Water supply===
The creation of the [[Quabbin Reservoir]] in the 1930s diverted the [[Quabbin Valley|Swift River]], which feeds the Chicopee River, a tributary of the Connecticut. This resulted in an unsuccessful lawsuit by the state of Connecticut against the diversion of its riparian waters.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Supreme Court, ''Connecticut v. Massachusetts'', {{Ussc|282|660|1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demand for drinking water in eastern Massachusetts passed the sustainable supply from the existing system in 1969. Diverting water from the Connecticut River was considered several times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ctriver.org/about-us/crwc-history/| title=CRWC History| publisher=Connecticut River Watershed Council| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1986 the [[Massachusetts Water Resources Authority]] instead undertook a campaign of water conservation. Demand was reduced to sustainable levels by 1989, reaching approximately a 25% margin of safety by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mwra.state.ma.us/monthly/wsupdat/demand-1985-2010-640.jpg| title=MWRA Water System Demand, 1985–2009| publisher=Massachusetts Water Resources Authority| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By far the largest river ecosystem in New England, the Connecticut River watershed spans five of the six New England states – New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, [[Connecticut]], as well as small portions of [[Maine]] and the Canadian province of Quebec.&lt;ref name="ctriver.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="crjc.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="des.nh.gov"/&gt;

The region along the river upstream and downstream from [[Lebanon, New Hampshire]], and [[White River Junction, Vermont]], is known as the "Upper Valley". The exact definition of the region varies, but it generally is considered to extend south to [[Windsor, Vermont]] and [[Cornish, New Hampshire]], and north to [[Bradford, Vermont]] and [[Piermont, New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://uppervalleychamber.com/| publisher=Upper Valley Chamber of Commerce| title=Upper Valley Bi-State Regional Chamber of Commerce| accessdate=July 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[The Trust for Public Land]] purchased {{convert|171000|acre|sqkm}} of land in New Hampshire from [[International Paper]], allowing the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters Partnership Task Force to plan the future protection of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/our-work/connecticut-lakes-headwaters|title=Connecticut Lakes Headwaters|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The property spans the towns of [[Pittsburg, New Hampshire|Pittsburg]], [[Clarksville, New Hampshire|Clarksville]], and [[Stewartstown, New Hampshire]], nearly 3 percent of the land in the state of New Hampshire.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/media-room/171000-acre-ct-headwaters-now-protected-nh#sm.000001tw1n9rvrfo8u6y3v8zmk5xa|title=171,000-Acre CT Headwaters Now Protected (NH)|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust for Public Land worked in partnership with the [[Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests]], [[The Nature Conservancy]] of New Hampshire, and others to raise around $42 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/our-work/connecticut-lakes-headwaters|title=Connecticut Lakes Headwaters|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[conservation easement]] over {{convert|146000|acre|sqkm}} of the property prohibits development of the land while allowing public access.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The forest is managed by the Lyme Timber Company, and the conservation easement over the land ensures sustainable forest management of the property.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===The Middle Connecticut River: Massachusetts through central Connecticut===
Following the most recent [[ice age]], the Middle Connecticut River Valley sat at the bottom of Lake Hitchcock. Its lush greenery and rich, almost rockless soil comes from the ancient lake's sedimentary deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.earthview.pair.com/ctriver.html| title=Geological History of the Connecticut River Valley| author=Richard D. Little| publisher=Earth View LLC| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Middle Connecticut region, the river reaches its maximum depth – {{convert|130|ft}} – at [[Gill, Massachusetts]], around the [[French King Bridge]], and its maximum width – {{convert|2100|ft}} – at [[Longmeadow, Massachusetts|Longmeadow]], directly across from the [[Six Flags New England]] amusement park.&lt;ref name="crjc.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name=abyss&gt;{{cite web| last=Klekowski| first=Ed| title=Stop 1-7B: Abyssal Depths in Turner's Falls Area, French King Bridge| url=http://climatechange.umaine.edu/friends/pdf/2000LakeHitchcock4.pdf| work=North Eastern Friends of the Pleistocene Field Conference| date=June 2–4, 2000| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Connecticut's largest falls – South Hadley Falls – features a vertical drop of {{convert|58|ft}}.&lt;ref name="ctriver.org"/&gt; Lush green forests and agricultural hamlets dot this middle portion of the Connecticut River; however, the region is best known for its numerous [[college town]]s, such as Northampton, [[South Hadley, Massachusetts|South Hadley]], and [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]], as well as the river's most populous city, Springfield. The city sits atop bluffs beside the Connecticut's confluence with two major tributaries, the Chicopee River to the east and Westfield River to the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.americancenturies.mass.edu/classroom/curriculum_6th/lesson3/bkgdessay.html| author=Susan McGowan| title=The Landscape in the Colonial Period| publisher=Americancenturies.mass.edu| accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Connecticut River is influenced by the tides as far north as Enfield Rapids in [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut]], approximately {{convert|58|mi}} north of the river's mouth. Two million residents live in the densely populated Hartford-Springfield region, which stretches roughly between the college towns of Amherst, Massachusetts, and Middletown, Connecticut. Hartford, the Connecticut River's second largest city and only state capital, is located at the southern end of this region on an ancient floodplain that stretches to Middletown.

===The Lower Connecticut River: Southern Connecticut to Long Island Sound===
{{convert|15|mi|0}} south of Hartford, at Middletown, the Lower Connecticut River section begins with a narrowing of the river, and then a sharp turn southeast. Throughout southern Connecticut, the Connecticut passes through a thinly populated, hilly, wooded region before again widening and discharging into [[Long Island Sound]] between Old Saybrook and [[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]]. Due to the presence of large, shifting sandbars at its mouth, the Connecticut is the only major river in the Northeastern United States without a port at its mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oldsaybrookct.org/Pages/OldSaybrookCT_CC/NHT_PDFs/StopNo2.pdf|format=PDF|title=Type 6 Conservation Site – Connecticut River Estuary |publisher=Oldsaybrookct.org| accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mouth and tidelands====
The Connecticut River carries a heavy amount of [[silt]], especially during the spring snow melt, from as far north as Quebec. This heavy silt concentration manifests in a large [[sandbar]] near the Connecticut's mouth, which has, historically, provided a formidable obstacle to navigation. Due to the difficulty it presents to ships, the Connecticut is one of the few major rivers in the United States without a major city at its mouth. The Connecticut's major cities – Hartford and Springfield – lie {{convert|45|and|69|mi|-1}} upriver, respectively.[[Image:Sediment Spews from Connecticut River.jpg|thumb|left|Satellite image of the Connecticut River depositing silt into [[Long Island Sound]]]]

[[The Nature Conservancy]] named the Connecticut River's tidelands one of the Western Hemisphere's "40 Last Great Places", while the [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar Convention on Wetlands]] listed its [[estuary]] and tidal [[wetlands]] complex as one of 1,759 wetlands of international importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.yankeemagazine.com/article/features/connecticutriver| title=Connecticut River Tidelands| work=''Yankee'' Magazine| accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the Connecticut River was designated one of only 14 [[American Heritage Rivers]], which recognized its "distinctive natural, economic, agricultural, scenic, historic, cultural and recreational qualities." In May 2012, the Connecticut River was designated America's first National [[Blueway]], in recognition of the restoration and preservation efforts on the river.&lt;ref name="connecticutriver.us" /&gt;

===Dams===
The Connecticut River's flow is slowed by main stem dams, which create a series of slow-flowing basins from Lake Francis Dam in Pittsburg, New Hampshire, to the Holyoke Dam at [[South Hadley]] Falls in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name="ctriver.org"/&gt; Among the most extensively dammed rivers in the United States, the Connecticut may soon flow at a more natural pace, according to scientists at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who have devised a computer that – "in an effort to balance human and natural needs" – coordinates the holding and releasing of water between the river's 54 largest dams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://scopeweb.mit.edu/articles/connecticut-river-may-soon-flow-freely-again/| title=Connecticut River May Soon Flow Freely Again| author=Sam Wotipka| date=October 10, 2013| work=Scope| publisher=MIT Graduate Program in Science Writing| accessdate=August 9, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220080510/http://scopeweb.mit.edu/articles/connecticut-river-may-soon-flow-freely-again/| archive-date=2016-02-20| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tributaries===
The Connecticut River watershed encompasses {{convert|11260|sqmi}}, connecting 148 tributaries, including 38 major rivers and numerous lakes and ponds.&lt;ref name="connecticutriver.us"/&gt; Major tributaries include (from north to south) the [[Passumpsic River|Passumpsic]], [[Ammonoosuc River|Ammonoosuc]], [[White River (Vermont)|White]], [[Black River (Connecticut River)|Black]], [[West River (Vermont)|West]], [[Ashuelot River|Ashuelot]], [[Millers River|Millers]], [[Deerfield River|Deerfield]], [[Chicopee River|Chicopee]], [[Westfield River|Westfield]], and [[Farmington River|Farmington]] rivers. The [[Swift River (Ware River)|Swift River]], a tributary of the Chicopee, has been dammed and largely replaced by the Quabbin Reservoir which [[water supply network|provides water]] to the [[Massachusetts Water Resources Authority]] district in eastern Massachusetts, including Boston and its [[Boston metropolitan area|metropolitan area]].

===Fish===
[[Image:BillDoingGuideWork.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Drift boat fishing guide working the river near [[Colebrook, New Hampshire]]]]
There are several species of [[anadromous]] and catadromous fish, including [[brook trout]], [[winter flounder]], [[blueback herring]], [[alewife]], [[rainbow trout]], large [[brown trout]], [[American shad]] (''Alosa sapidissima''), [[hickory shad]], [[smallmouth bass]], [[Atlantic sturgeon]], [[striped bass]] (''Morone saxatilis''), [[American eel]], [[sea lamprey]], and endangered shortnose sturgeon and dwarf wedgemussels.&lt;ref name="fws.gov"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/fisheries/resource/habitat.html| title=Fisheries Program - Northeast Region – U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service| author=Northeast Region Web Development Group| publisher=Fws.gov| accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] has repopulated the river with another species of migratory fish, the [[Atlantic salmon]], which for more than 200 years had been [[extinct]] from the river due to [[dam]]ming.&lt;ref name="fws.gov"/&gt; Several [[fish ladder]]s and fish elevators have been built to allow fish to resume their natural migration upriver each spring.

Fresh and brackish water residents of the main branch and tributaries include [[common carp]], [[White bullhead|white catfish]], [[brown bullhead]], [[fallfish]], [[yellow perch]], [[smallmouth bass]], [[largemouth bass]], [[northern pike]], [[chain pickerel]], [[bluegill]], [[pumpkinseed sunfish]], [[golden shiner]], and [[rock bass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Species Conservation |url=https://www.fws.gov/r5crc/species.html |website=US Fish and Wildlife Service |publisher=US Fish and Wildlife Service |accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the beginning of the river's course in the town of Pittsburg is occupied by the Connecticut Lakes, which contain [[lake trout]] and [[landlocked salmon]]. Landlocked salmon make their way into the river during spring spawning runs of [[bait fish]] and during their fall spawn. The river has fly-fishing-only regulations on {{convert|5|mi|0}} of river. Most of the river from Lake Francis south is open to lure and bait as well. Two tail-water dams provide cold river water for miles downstream, making for bountiful summer fishing on the Connecticut.

After the first major dam was built near [[Turners Falls, Massachusetts]], thirteen additional dams have ended the Connecticut River's great anadromous fish runs. Fish ladders constructed since the first fish passage in 1980 at Turners Falls, have enabled migrating fish to return to some of their former spawning grounds. In addition to dams, warm water discharges between 1978 and 1992 from [[Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant]] in Vernon, Vermont released water up to {{convert|105|F|C}} degrees and the thermal plume reached {{convert|55|mi|km}} downstream to Holyoke. This thermal pollution appears to be associated with an 80% decline in American shad fish numbers from 1992 to 2005 at Holyoke dam. This decline may have been exacerbated by over-fishing in the mid-Atlantic and predation from resurging striped bass populations. The nuclear plant was closed at the end of 2014 but the 2015 shad run at Vernon numbered only 42,000 shad.&lt;ref name=Caduto/&gt;

There are 12 species of [[Freshwater bivalve|freshwater mussels]].&lt;ref name="biodrawversity.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.biodrawversity.com/pubs/Front_Matter.pdf| author=Nedeau, Ethan Jay| date=2008| title=Freshwater Mussels and the Connecticut River Watershed| publisher=Connecticut River Watershed Council, Greenfield, MA| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those, 11 occur in the mainstem of the Connecticut, all but the [[brook floater]], which is found only in small streams and rivers. Species diversity is higher in the southern part of the watershed (Connecticut and Massachusetts) than in the northern part (Vermont and New Hampshire), largely due to differences in stream gradient and substrate. Eight of the 12 species in the watershed are listed as endangered, threatened, or of Special Concern in one or more of the states in the watershed.&lt;ref name="biodrawversity.com"/&gt;

==Economy==
&lt;!---
A countless number of rivers have been used as means to transport people, goods, etc., and are still used so today. All such information should be described here. Stylistically, this can be a good segue from history, connecting past uses of the river to present-day uses.
---&gt;

===Boating===
The mouth of the river up to [[Essex, Connecticut|Essex]] is thought to be one of the busiest stretches of waterway in Connecticut. Some local police departments and the state Environmental Conservation Police patrol the area a few times a week. Some towns keep boats available if needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kaplan, Thomas|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/30/nyregion/30saybrook.html?ref=nyregion&amp;pagewanted=print|title=River Watchers, Tackling Speeders and Thin Budgets.|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 30, 2007|accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Massachusetts, the most active stretch of the Connecticut River is centered on [[The Oxbow (Connecticut River)|the Oxbow]], {{convert|14|mi}} north of Springfield in the college town of Northampton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oxbow-marina.com/| title=Welcome| publisher=Oxbow Marina| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camping is available along much of the river, for non-motorized boats, via the Connecticut River Paddlers' Trail. The Paddlers' Trail currently includes campsites on over {{convert|300|mi|-1}} of the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://connecticutriverpaddlerstrail.org/| title=Connecticut River Paddlers' Trail| website=connecticutriverpaddlerstrail.org| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution and cleanup===
[[Image:Connecticut River restoration Farilee VT1.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Stream restoration|Riverbank restoration]] project in [[Fairlee, Vermont]]]]
The [[Water Quality Act]] of 1965 had a major impact on controlling [[water pollution]] in the Connecticut River and its tributaries.

Since then, the river has&lt;!--really need to link or describe what classes d and b are. Couldn't find template to flat there---&gt; been restored from Class D to Class B (fishable and swimmable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/water/wmb/tmdl/documents/appx-i-upper-connecticut.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/pip/factsheets/rl/documents/rl-14.pdf|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many towns along the Lower Connecticut River have enacted a cap on further [[land development|development]] along the banks, so that no buildings may be constructed except on existing foundations. Currently, a website provides [[water quality]] reports twice a week, indicating whether various portions of the river are safe for swimming, boating and fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettenet.com/2008/09/15/connecticut-river-sewer-runs-through-it|title=News and Information from Northampton, MA by the Daily Hampshire Gazette – GazetteNet.com|publisher=Gazettenet.com|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="testing"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cesd.umass.edu/twi/TWI_Projects/Water_Quality_Monitoring/| title=Water Quality Monitoring| work=Tri-State Connecticut River Targeted Watershed Initiative |publisher=Center for Educational Software Development – University of Massachusetts Amherst| accessdate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crossings===
{{Main article|List of crossings of the Connecticut River}}
The Connecticut River is a barrier to travel between western and eastern New England. Several major transportation corridors cross the river including [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]], [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|Interstate 95]] ([[Connecticut Turnpike]]), [[Interstate 90]] ([[Massachusetts Turnpike]]), [[Interstate 89]], [[Interstate 93]], and [[Interstate 84 (east)|Interstate 84]]. In addition, [[Interstate 91]], whose route largely follows the river north-south, crosses it twice – once in Connecticut and once in Massachusetts.

Mutually beneficial connections among industry, natural systems, energy, material and local communities become central factors in designing industrial production processes.&lt;ref name=HandBook&gt;{{cite web|title=Handbook on Codes, Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions for Eco-Industrial Parks |url=http://www.cfe.cornell.edu/wei/papers/codes_files/codes.htm |publisher=Cornell Center for the Environment |accessdate=23 April 2014 |author=Cohen-Rosenthal, E |year=1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011225060140/http://www.cfe.cornell.edu/wei/papers/codes_files/codes.htm |archivedate=December 25, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach itself is largely voluntary and market-driven but often pressed ahead by favorable government treatment or efforts of development co-operation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== History ==
Since the early 1990s the idea of EID evolved from [[Symbiosis|biological symbiosis]].  This concept was adapted by industrial ecologists in the search for innovative approaches to solve problems of waste, energy shortage and degradation of the environment.  A continuous approach towards improving both environmental and economic outcomes is used.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, B. (2007): The Limit and Merit of Taking Sustainable Buildings as a Catalyst for Eco-Industrial Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[international community]] officially connected development co-operation to sustainable environmental protection for the first time. At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ([[UNCED]]) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil nearly 180 states signed the conference’s Rio Declaration. Although non-binding, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development laid out 27 principles that shall guide the increasing inter-connectedness of development cooperation and sustainability.&lt;ref name=UN1992&gt;{{cite web|title=REPORT OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/conf151/aconf15126-1annex1.htm|publisher=United nations|accessdate=23 April 2014|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the documents drafting was accompanied by a presentation describing the idea of eco-industrial development for the first time.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In the following years, EID became popular throughout the United States. The recently elected [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration installed a summit of business, labor, government and environmental protection representatives to further develop the approach. This summit established the idea of [[eco-industrial park]]s but soon realized that at first a more efficient management of raw materials, energy and waste has to be achieved.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Since then, the broad goals and application principles of EID have hardly changed and only became adapted to the rapid technological progress.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In 2012 the IGEP Foundation, for the promotion of trade,&lt;ref name=IGEP&gt;{{cite web|title=IGEP Foundation homepage|url=http://www.igep.org/|publisher=IGEP Foundation|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; published a report called ''Pathway to Eco Industrial Development in India – Concepts and Cases''.&lt;ref name=Pathway&gt;{{cite web|title=Pathway to Eco Industrial Development in India – Concepts and Cases|url=http://www.igep.in/live/hrdpmp/hrdpmaster/igep/content/e48745/e50194/e50195/121004_Pathway_EID_ISOX3uncoated-1.pdf|publisher=IGEP Foundation|accessdate=23 April 2014|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field is researched by the Nation Centre for Eco-Industrial Development, a joint project by the [[University of Southern California]] and [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name=usc&gt;{{cite web|title=National Center for Eco-Industrial Development|url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/price/research/NCEID/|publisher=usc.edu|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals and concepts ==
The primary goal of eco-industrial development is a significant and continuous improvement in both business and environmental performance. Herein, the notion of industry not only relates to private-sector manufacturing but also covers state-owned enterprise, the service sector as well as transportation. EID’s twin guideline is reflected specifically in the “eco” of eco-industrial as it resembles ecology (decrease in pollution and waste) and economy (increase in commercial success) at the same time.&lt;ref name="WhatIs" /&gt; In order to build a framework of defining an enterprise’s sustainable performance at the micro level, resource use optimization, minimization of waste, cleaner technologies and pollution limits are used in achieving a broad range of goals in EID: 
	
* '''[[Resource efficiency]]''' minimizes the use of energy, materials, water and transportation. This, in turn, lowers production costs due to savings in virtually all areas of business.&lt;ref name="Pathway"/&gt;
* '''Cleaner production''' is a predominantly environmental measure, which aims at the reduction or even substitution of toxics, emissions-control or the re-use of residual material.
* '''[[Renewables]]''' in both energy and material use shall eliminate all pollution through fossil fuels.
* '''Greening of buildings or production sites''' installs high energy and environmental standards by relying on innovation in green architecture or engineering. Moreover, new facility and infrastructure design may also enhance the quality of life in neighboring communities significantly.
* '''Environmental management systems''' such as the [[ISO 14000]] ensure a continuous improvement through regular audits and the progressing establishment of environmental targets.
* '''Ecological site planning''' can then combine each of these aspects by developing a clear understanding of air, water and ground system capacities throughout the surrounding eco-system.
  
Eco-industrial development hence explores the possibility of improvement at the local level.&lt;ref name="WhatIs" /&gt; In unique case-to-case analyses, particular geography, human potential or business climate are investigated. In contrast to the widespread race for top-down governmental support such as tax cuts, EID emphasizes locally achievable success and rooms for improvement. As a result, purposeful enforcements of action plans can make a large difference by optimizing the interaction of business, community and ecological systems.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

== Instruments ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
Eco-industrial development includes and employs four major conceptual instruments. Each of the approaches intends to combine the seemingly antithetic processes of industrial development and bolstering sustainability.

* '''[[Industrial Ecology]]''' focuses on both industrial as well as consumer behavior. By assessing flows of energy and material, the approach determines the flows influences on the environment. In turn, it explores ways and means of optimizing the whole production chain from flow and use of resources to their final transformation. During these analyses, influences of economic, political, regulatory and social factors are key.
* The concept of '''[[Industrial Symbiosis]]''' is based on mainly voluntary cooperation of different industries. By conglomerating complementary enterprises and by then adapting their respective production chains, the presence of each may increase viability and profitability of the others. Therefore, symbioses consider resource scarcity and environmental protection as crucial factors in developing sustainable industries and profits. Industrial Symbiosis often becomes manifest in [[Eco-industrial park]]s.
* '''Environmental Management Systems''' include a wide range of different environmental management approaches in order to ensure continual improvement in sustainability. In early stages, monitoring companies facilitates the identification of hazardous environmental aspects. Further on, objectives and targets are set under consideration of legal requirements. Finally, the establishment of regular audits and other reporting systems combined with continuous follow-up targets shall ensure a constant improvement towards greener industrial production.
* The '''Design for the Environment''' concept originated in engineering disciplines as well as from the product life-cycle analysis. It is a simple but all-encompassing assessment of a product’s potential environmental impact – ranging from energy and materials used for packaging, transportation, consumer use and disposal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="60502">[[Employment discrimination law]] in the [[United States]] derives from the [[common law]], and is codified in numerous state and federal laws, particularly the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], as well as in the ordinances of counties and municipalities. These laws prohibit discrimination based on certain characteristics or protected categories. The [[United States Constitution]] also prohibits discrimination by federal and state governments against their public employees. Discrimination in the [[private sector]] is not directly constrained by the Constitution, but has become subject to a growing body of federal and state law. Federal law prohibits discrimination in a number of areas, including recruiting, hiring, job evaluations, promotion policies, training, compensation and disciplinary action. State laws often extend protection to additional categories or employers.

Under Federal law, employers generally cannot discriminate against employees on the basis of:
* [[Race (classification of human beings)|Race]]&lt;ref name="Title VII"/&gt;
* [[Sex]]&lt;ref name="Title VII"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Equal Pay Act"/&gt;
* [[Pregnancy]]&lt;ref name="Pregnancy Discrimination Act"/&gt;

* [[Citizenship]] status (for citizens, permanent residents, temporary residents, refugees, and asylees)&lt;ref name="INA"&gt;{{usc|8|1324b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have found declining gaps in earnings by race as access to high quality education has improved and anti-discrimination and affirmative action policies have been implemented.&lt;ref name="Race"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McIntyre|first1=Frank|last2=Simkovic|first2=Michael|title=Are law degrees as valuable to minorities?|journal=International Review of Law &amp; Economics|volume=53|pages=23–37|doi=10.1016/j.irle.2017.09.004 |ssrn=3037749|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional basis==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2009}}
The [[United States Constitution]] does not directly address employment discrimination, but its prohibitions on discrimination by the federal government have been held to protect federal government employees.

The [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution]] limit the power of the federal and state governments to discriminate. The Fifth Amendment has an explicit requirement that the federal government does not deprive individuals of "life, liberty, or property", without due process of the law. It also contains an implicit guarantee that the Fourteenth Amendment explicitly prohibits states from violating an individual's rights of [[due process]] and [[equal protection]]. In the employment context, these Constitutional provisions would limit the right of the state and federal governments to discriminate in their employment practices by treating employees, former employees, or job applicants unequally because of membership in a group (such as a race or sex). Due process protection requires that government employees have a fair procedural process before they are terminated if the termination is related to a "liberty" (such as the right to [[free speech]]) or property interest. As both Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses are passive, the clause that empowers Congress to pass anti-discrimination bills (so they are not unconstitutional under Tenth Amendment) is [[Congressional power of enforcement|Section 5 of Fourteenth Amendment]].

Employment discrimination or harassment in the private sector is not unconstitutional because Federal and most State Constitutions do not expressly give their respective government the power to enact civil rights laws that apply to the private sector.  The Federal government's authority to regulate a private business, including civil rights laws, stems from their power to regulate all commerce between the States.  Some State Constitutions do expressly afford some protection from public and private employment discrimination, such as Article I of the [[California Constitution]].  However, most State Constitutions only address discriminatory treatment by the government, including a public employer.

Absent of a provision in a State Constitution, State civil rights laws that regulate the private sector are generally Constitutional under the "[[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police powers]]" doctrine or the power of a State to enact laws designed to protect public health, safety and morals.   All States must adhere to the Federal Civil Rights laws, but States may enact civil rights laws that offer additional employment protection.

For example, some State civil rights laws offer protection from employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or political affiliation, even though such forms of discrimination are not yet covered in federal civil rights laws.

==History of federal laws==
Federal law governing employment discrimination has developed over time.

The [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|Equal Pay Act]] amended the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] in 1963. It is enforced by the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor. '''&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=189578|title=Bringing Gender and Race in: U.S. Employment Discrimination Policy|journal=Gender and Society|volume=7|issue=2|pages=204–226|last1=Blankenship|first1=Kim M|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' The Equal Pay Act prohibits employers and unions from paying different wages based on sex. It does not prohibit other discriminatory practices in hiring. It provides that where workers perform equal work in the corner requiring "equal skill, effort, and responsibility and performed under similar working conditions," they should be provided equal pay.&lt;ref name="Equal Pay Act"&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/epa.html The Equal Pay Act of 1963]&lt;/ref&gt; The Fair Labor Standards Act applies to employers engaged in some aspect of [[interstate commerce]], or all of an employer's workers if the enterprise is engaged as a whole in a significant amount of interstate commerce.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

[[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VII|Title VII]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits discrimination in many more aspects of the employment relationship. "Title VII created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to administer the act"'''.''' &lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; It applies to most employers engaged in interstate commerce with more than 15 employees, labor organizations, and employment agencies. Title VII prohibits discrimination based on race, color, [[religion]], [[sex]] or national origin. It makes it illegal for employers to discriminate based upon protected characteristics regarding terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.  Employment agencies may not discriminate when hiring or referring applicants, and [[labor organizations]] are also prohibited from basing membership or union classifications on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.&lt;ref name="Title VII"&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/vii.html Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Pregnancy Discrimination Act]] amended [[Title VII]] in 1978, specifying that unlawful sex discrimination includes discrimination based on [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], and related medical conditions.&lt;ref name="Pregnancy Discrimination Act"&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/abouteeoc/35th/thelaw/pregnancy_discrimination-1978.html Pregnancy Discrimination Act]&lt;/ref&gt;
A related statute, the [[Family and Medical Leave Act]], sets requirements governing leave for [[pregnancy]] and
pregnancy-related conditions.&lt;ref name="FMLA"&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/fmla/ Family and Medical Leave Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive Order 11246 in 1965 "prohibits discrimination by federal contractors and subcontractors on account of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin [and] requires affirmative action by federal contractors".&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=44066330|title=Employment Discrimination Laws and Their Application|journal=Law Notes for the General Practitioner|volume=16|issue=1|pages=25–29|last1=Rozmarin|first1=George C|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]] (ADEA), enacted in 1968 and amended in 1978 and 1986, prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of age. The prohibited practices are nearly identical to those outlined in Title VII, except that the ADEA protects workers in firms with 20 or more workers rather than 15 or more. An employee is protected from discrimination based on age if he or she is over 40.  Since 1978, the ADEA has phased out and prohibited mandatory retirement, except for high-powered decision-making positions (that also provide large pensions). The ADEA contains explicit guidelines for benefit, pension and retirement plans.&lt;ref name="ADEA"&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/adea.html The Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967]&lt;/ref&gt; Though ADEA is the center of most discussion of age discrimination legislation, there is a longer history starting with the abolishment of "maximum ages of entry into employment in 1956" by the United States Civil Service Commission. Then in 1964, Executive Order 11141 "established a policy against age discrimination among federal contractors".&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Neumark, D. 2003.

The [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of disability by the federal government, federal contractors with contracts of more than $10,000, and programs receiving federal financial assistance.&lt;ref name="Disability laws"&gt;[http://www.ada.gov/cguide.htm#anchor65610 A Guide to Disability Rights Laws]&lt;/ref&gt;  It requires [[affirmative action]] as well as non-discrimination.&lt;ref name="Disability laws"/&gt;  [[Section 504]] requires reasonable accommodation, and [[Section 508]] requires that electronic and information technology be accessible to disabled employees.&lt;ref name="Disability laws"/&gt;

The [[Black Lung Benefits Act of 1973]] prohibits discrimination by mine operators against miners who suffer from "black lung disease" ([[pneumoconiosis]]).&lt;ref name="USC Black Lung"&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t29t32+1359+39++%28black%20l 30 USC Sec. 938]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnam Era Readjustment Act of 1974 "requires affirmative action for disabled and Vietnam era veterans by federal contractors".&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

The [[Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978]] prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of bankruptcy or bad debts.&lt;ref name="Bankruptcy Act"/&gt;

The [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]] prohibits employers with more than three employees from discriminating against anyone (except an unauthorized immigrant) on the basis of national origin or citizenship status.&lt;ref name="THOMAS IRCA"&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d099:SN01200:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;|TOM:/bss/d099query.html Summary of Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA) was enacted to eliminate discriminatory barriers against qualified individuals with disabilities, individuals with a record of a disability, or individuals who are regarded as having a disability. It prohibits discrimination based on real or perceived physical or mental disabilities. It also requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to employees who need them because of a disability to apply for a job, perform the essential functions of a job, or enjoy the benefits and privileges of employment, unless the employer can show that [[undue hardship]] will result. There are strict limitations on when an employer can ask disability-related questions or require medical examinations, and all medical information must be treated as confidential. A disability is defined under the ADA as a mental or physical health condition that "substantially limits one or more major life activities."&lt;ref name="ADA"&gt;[http://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.htm AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990, AS AMENDED]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nineteenth Century Civil Rights Acts, amended in 1993, ensure all persons equal rights under the law and outline the damages available to complainants in actions brought under Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]], and the [[1973 Rehabilitation Act]].&lt;ref name="42 USC 1982"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1981- § 1981.

The [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] of 2008 bars employers from using individuals' genetic information when making hiring, firing, job placement, or promotion decisions.&lt;ref name="GINA"/&gt;

The proposed US [[Equality Act of 2015]] would ban discrimination on the basis of [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]].&lt;ref name="NGLTF ENDA"&gt;[http://www.thetaskforce.org/issues/nondiscrimination/ENDA_main_page Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA)]&lt;/ref&gt; {{asof|2018|6}}, 28 US states do not explicitly include [[sexual orientation]] and 29 US states do not explicitly include [[gender identity]] within anti-discrimination statutes.

==LGBT employment discrimination==
The regulation of [[LGBT employment discrimination in the United States]] varies by jurisdiction. Many states and localities prohibit bias in hiring, promotion, job assignment, termination, and compensation, as well as harassment on the basis of one's [[sexual orientation]]. Fewer extend those protections to cover [[sexual identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=10.1086/661653|doi=10.1086/661653|title=Pride and Prejudice: Employment Discrimination against Openly Gay Men in the United States|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=117|issue=2|pages=586–626|year=2011|last1=Tilcsik|first1=András|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/34998/1/TilcsikAJS.pdf|format=Full text}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cover government employees but do not extend their protections to the private sector. Protections at the national level are limited.

There is no federal statute addressing employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or [[gender identity]]. During President Obama's tenure Congress came close to enactment of the Employment-Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), a federal statute explicitly prohibiting discrimination against LGBT workers. The ''[[Washington Blade]]'' noted that the [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act]] (ENDA) has had strong bipartisan support, and even Democratic leadership has signed on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonblade.com/2014/03/18/xxx-lawmakers-call-obama-action-lgbt-workplace-rights/ Nearly 200 lawmakers seek action from Obama for LGBT workers]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Senate passed ENDA it did not survive the House. In March 2014, 195 lawmakers, 148 House members, and 47 Senators, all Democrats, signed an appeal to President Obama, encouraging him to enact protections for LGBT workers in an [[executive order]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.towleroad.com/2014/03/195-lawmakers-all-dems-sign-letter-urging-obama-to-protect-lgbt-workers-in-executive-order.html 195 LAWMAKERS, ALL DEMS, SIGN LETTER URGING OBAMA TO PROTECT LGBT WORKERS IN EXECUTIVE ORDER]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/213181098/LGBT-Executive-Order-Letter-3-18-14 LGBT Executive Order Letter 3/18/14]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Executive Order 13672]].)

Federal courts have generally agreed that [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which prohibits [[Sex discrimination in the United States|sex discrimination]] in the workplace, does not prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation although some courts following [[Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins|Pricewaterhouse v. Hopkins]] support protecting transgender employees from discrimination as a form of sex stereotyping. In early 2018 two federal appellate courts ([[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh Circuit]]) reversed circuit precedent on sexual orientation discrimination to hold Title VII prohibits sexual orientation discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://denverlaborlaw.com/2018/03/05/are-tides-changes-in-favor-of-prohibiting-sexual-orientation-discrimination-under-title-vii/|title=Are tides changes in favor of prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination under Title VII?|date=2018-03-05|work=Denver Labor Law|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit]] also reversed precedent finding Title VII prohibits transgender discrimination in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://denverlaborlaw.com/2018/03/10/title-vii-lgbt-sex-discrimination/|title=Another appellate court holds Title VII bars LGBT discrimination as a form of sex discrimination|date=2018-03-10|work=Denver Labor Law|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Crosby Burns and Jeff Krehely: "Studies show that anywhere from 15 percent to 43 percent of gay people have experienced some form of discrimination and harassment at the workplace. Moreover, a staggering 90 percent of transgender workers report some form of harassment or mistreatment on the job." Many people in the LGBT community have lost their job, including Vandy Beth Glenn, a transgender woman who claims that her boss told her that her presence may make other people feel uncomfortable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burns|first1=Crosby|last2=Krehely|first2=Jeff|title=Gay and Transgender People Face High Rates of Workplace Discrimination and Harassment|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2011/06/02/9872/gay-and-transgender-people-face-high-rates-of-workplace-discrimination-and-harassment/|website=Center for American Progress|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost half of the United States has laws banning the discrimination of gender non-conforming and transgender people in both public and private workplaces. A few more states ban LGBT discrimination in only public workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Orientation Discrimination in the Workplace|url=http://employment.findlaw.com/employment-discrimination/sexual-orientation-discrimination-in-the-workplace.html|website=FindLaw|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some opponents of these laws believe that it would intrude on religious liberty, even though these laws are focused more on discriminatory actions, not beliefs. Courts have also identified that these laws do not infringe free speech or religious liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowndes|first1=Coleman|last2=Maza|first2=Carlos|title=The Top Five Myths About LGBT Non-Discrimination Laws Debunked|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/09/23/the-top-five-myths-about-lgbt-non-discriminatio/200832|website=Media Matters for America|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State law==
State statutes also provide extensive protection from employment discrimination. Some laws extend similar protection as provided by the federal acts to employers who are not covered by those statutes.  Other statutes provide protection to groups not covered by the federal acts.  Some state laws provide greater protection to employees of the state or of state contractors.

The following table lists protected categories not included in federal law.  Age is included as well, since federal law only covers workers over 40.

==Government employees==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}

Employees of federal and state governments have additional protections against employment discrimination.

The [[Civil Service Reform Act of 1978]] prohibits discrimination in federal employment on the basis of conduct that does not affect [[job performance]].  The [[Office of Personnel Management]] has interpreted this as prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="OPM Sexual Orientation"&gt;[http://www.opm.gov/er/address2/Guide04.asp Addressing Sexual Orientation Discrimination In Federal Civilian Employment: A Guide to Employee's Rights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114092004/http://www.opm.gov/er/address2/Guide04.asp |date=2007-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2009, it was announced that the interpretation would be expanded to include gender identity.&lt;ref name="NYT federal transgender"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/us/24transgender.html New Protections for Transgender Federal Workers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exceptions==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2009}}

===Bona fide occupational qualifications===
{{Main|Bona fide occupational qualifications}}

Employers are generally allowed to consider characteristics that would otherwise be discriminatory if they are bona fide occupational qualifications (BFOQ).  For example, a manufacturer of men's clothing may lawfully advertise for male models.

{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}

===Religious Employment Discrimination===
“[[Religious discrimination]] is treating individuals differently in their employment because of their [[religion]], their religious beliefs and practices, and/or their request for accommodation (a change in a workplace rule or policy) of their religious beliefs and practices. It also includes treating individuals differently in their employment because of their lack of religious belief or practice” ([[Workplace Fairness]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.workplacefairness.org/religion&lt;/ref&gt; According to The U.S. [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]], employers are prohibited from refusing to hire an individual based on their religion- alike race, sex, age, and disability. If an employee believes that they have experienced religious discrimination, they should address this to the alleged offender. On the other hand, employees are protected by the law for reporting job discrimination and are able to file charges with the EEOC.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/qanda_religion.html&lt;/ref&gt; Some locations in the U.S. now have clauses that ban discrimination against atheists. The courts and laws of the United States give certain exemptions in these laws to businesses or institutions that are religious or religiously-affiliated, however, to varying degrees in different locations, depending on the setting and the context; some of these have been upheld and others reversed over time.

===Members of the Communist Party===

Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] explicitly permits discrimination against members of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]].

===Military===

The military has faced criticism for prohibiting women from serving in combat roles. In 2016, however, the law was amended to allow them to serve.

&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2016/11/10/us/women-combat-us-military/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/what-was-black-americas-double-war/

http://www.militaryaerospace.com/blogs/mil-aero-blog/2012/12/conspicuous-gallantry-doris-miller-at-pearl-harbor-was-one-of-world-war-ii-s-first-heroes.html

http://www.nationalgeographic.com/pearlharbor/ngbeyond/people/
&lt;/ref&gt;
In the article posted on the PBS website, Henry Louis Gates Jr. writes about the way in which black men were treated in the military during the 1940s. According to Gates, during that time the whites gave the African Americans a chance to prove themselves as Americans by having them participate in the war. The National Geographic website states, however, that when black soldiers joined the Navy, they were only allowed to work as servants; their participation was limited to the roles of mess attendants, stewards, and cooks. Even when African Americans wanted to defend the country they lived in, they were denied the power to do so.

==Unintentional discrimination==
{{Main|Adverse impact}}

Employment practices that do not directly discriminate against a protected category may still be illegal if they produce a disparate impact on members of a protected group.  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment practices that have a discriminatory impact, unless they are related to job performance.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Act requires the elimination of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment that operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of race, and, if, as here, an employment practice that operates to exclude Negroes cannot be shown to be related to job performance, it is prohibited, notwithstanding the employer's lack of discriminatory intent.&lt;ref name="Griggs"&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=401&amp;invol=424 GRIGGS v. DUKE POWER CO., 401 U.S. 424 (1971)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Height and weight requirements have been identified by the EEOC as having a disparate impact on national origin minorities.&lt;ref name="EEOC Shaping"&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/abouteeoc/35th/1965-71/shaping.html Shaping Employment Discrimination Law]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when defending against a disparate impact claim that alleges [[age discrimination]], an employer does not need to demonstrate necessity; rather, it must simply show that its practice is reasonable.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Enforcing entities==
The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) interprets and enforces the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963|Equal Pay Act]], [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]], Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title I and V of the Americans With Disabilities Act, Sections 501 and 505 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991.&lt;ref name="EEOC Laws"&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/abouteeo/overview_laws.html Federal Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Laws]&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission was established by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.&lt;ref name="EEOC History to 1965"&gt;[http://www.eeoc.gov/abouteeoc/35th/pre1965/index.html Pre 1965: Events Leading to the Creation of EEOC]&lt;/ref&gt; Its enforcement provisions are contained in section 2000e-5 of Title 42,&lt;ref name="LII 42 2000e-5"&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e-5 § 2000e–5.

Under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, each agency has and enforces its own regulations that apply to its own programs and to any entities that receive financial assistance.&lt;ref name="Disability laws"/&gt;

The [[Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices]] (OSC) enforces the anti-discrimination provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1324b, which prohibits discrimination based on citizenship status or national origin.&lt;ref name="OSC Overview"&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/osc/htm/WebOverview2005.htm An Overview of the Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Enrique Bolín Pérez-Argemí''' (27 February 1940 – 17 October 2018) was a Spanish industrialist and [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] politician who served as Mayor of [[Benalmádena]] and [[Senate of Spain|Senator]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senado.es/web/composicionorganizacion/senadores/composicionsenado/fichasenador/index.html?legis=3&amp;id1=10763 BOLÍN PÉREZ-ARGEMI, ENRIQUE] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1989 he was sentenced to prison for the crime of possession of cocaine, for which he was expelled from the party despite reducing the penalty to a fine, and in 2008 he was sentenced to eight years of disqualification for a crime of urban trespass.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-23-11-2008/abc/Nacional/condenan-a-enrique-bolin-a-ocho-a%C3%B1os-de-inabilitacion-por-delito-urbanistico_911445944735.html Condenan a Enrique Bolín a ocho años de inhabilitación por delito urbanístico] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the son of Enrique Bolín Bidwell, promoter of tourism and hospitality on the Costa del Sol, and nephew of [[Luis Bolín]], correspondent in London of the newspaper ABC, who rented the Dragon Rapide plane that took [[Francisco Franco]] from the Canaries to Tetouan so he could join to the coup d'état in Spain in July 1936 that led to the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the fall of the Second Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.diariosur.es/costadelsol/fallece-enrique-bolin-20181018094253-nt.html Fallece a los 78 años Enrique Bolín, histórico alcalde de Benalmádena] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.diariodesevilla.es/entrevistas/cometi-delito-quiere-vuelva-alcalde_0_465853449.html "No cometí ningún delito, la gente quiere que vuelva a ser alcalde"] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7241">The '''''Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act''''' was enacted in 1988 in response to a long-standing and widespread concern that [[Canada]]’s heritage railway stations were not being protected. Bill C-205, An Act to protect heritage railway stations, was proposed by MP [[Gordon Taylor (politician)|Gordon Taylor]] in a [[private member's bill#Canada|private member's bill]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parlinfo/Compilations/HouseOfCommons/Legislation/privatememberspublicbills.aspx |title=Private Members' Public Bills Passed by Parliament |publisher=[[Parliament of Canada]] |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which received support of all parties in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]].

==Background==
The railway was once the backbone of Canada. This changed with widespread adoption of the automobile. The [[Trans-Canada Highway]] opened in 1962; [[Ontario Highway 2|Highway 2]], the congested [[Main Street]] in every town in the busy [[Quebec City–Windsor Corridor]], was bypassed by the [[Ontario Highway 401|401]]/[[Quebec Autoroute 20|20]] freeway in 1968. Passenger train ridership dropped from a [[World War II]] peak of 60 million to less than 5 million in 1977. Federally owned [[Via Rail]] provided [[Canadian National Railway|CN]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]] an exit from the long-unprofitable passenger rail business in 1978. The railways retained ownership of tracks, railway stations and freight operations. A long series of Via Rail budget cuts from 1981 onward eventually left countless small villages stranded in the wilderness with no passenger rail service.

The railways had little incentive to preserve or re-purpose abandoned passenger stations. Municipalities found provincial heritage preservation laws inadequate to protect railway history as interprovincial rail is within federal jurisdiction. 
[[West Toronto Diamond|CP's West Toronto station]], closed when its last passenger train was rerouted in 1978,&lt;ref&gt;Via Rail "Western Transcontinental Services" timetables (with and without service), June 1 and October 29, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; was unlawfully demolished&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==About the Act==
[[Image:Grand Trunk outer station ruins - Kingston.jpg|thumb|A protected heritage railway station in Kingston, Ontario]]
Designation of heritage railway stations and specific heritage features is made on the recommendation of the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada by the minister responsible for [[Parks Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/H-3.5/FullText.html |title=Heritage Railway Stations Protection Act |publisher=Canadian Ministry of Justice |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Requests to the Board, in turn, typically originate from local entities such as municipalities and historic preservation groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnr-in-ontario.com/Reports/RSR-005.html |title=RSR-5—CNR—Brantford, Ontario |publisher=Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada |date= |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protection of heritage railway stations applies to all railway companies under the ''Canada Transportation Act''. No railway company may in any way alter, demolish, or transfer ownership of a designated heritage railway station without the authorization of the [[Government of Canada]]. There is a process in place through which any proposed changes can be reviewed and approved; public notice must be given to allow objections to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc.gc.ca/clmhc-hsmbc/heritage.aspx Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada summary of the Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

Violations of the ''Act'' are punishable by fines of not less than fifty thousand dollars and not more than one million dollars.

==Limitations==
Eligibility is limited to stations owned by federally licensed railway companies. A municipally owned station on an active rail line of federal importance (such as the 1856 [[Napanee railway station]]) therefore would not qualify regardless of historic notability or age. The protection ends when a historic station is sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/business/story.html?id=2e53e652-4b97-4735-aa8a-bb6584d21d34 |title=Windsor station to obtain Quebec heritage protection |publisher=[[Montreal Gazette]] |date=2008-10-11 |accessdate=2013-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024191502/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/business/story.html?id=2e53e652-4b97-4735-aa8a-bb6584d21d34 |archivedate=2013-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Act'' only protects railway stations; it does not extend to other historic railway structures, such as roundhouses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/local/story.html?id=d6f1a699-3e13-4e7d-83c9-82a8af7f1314 |title=Community works to save historic roundhouse |publisher=The StarPhoenix (Saskatoon) |date=2008-07-12 |accessdate=2013-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026125716/http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/local/story.html?id=d6f1a699-3e13-4e7d-83c9-82a8af7f1314 |archivedate=2013-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation also does nothing to require a railway to maintain a property to Heritage Canada guidelines or repair any damage, even as the structure declines to the point of violating municipal standards. By inaction, a railway can leave a historic structure in ruins. [[Kingston, Ontario]] mayor Mark Gerretsen has denounced this situation as a "loophole" as an 1856 [[Grand Trunk Railway]] station in that city is designated as being historic but "when [[Canadian National Railway|CN]] lost its [[Crown corporation]] status they put in legislation that says if the building is ever sold [[Ontario Heritage Act|the normal heritage act]] kicks in. Until it is sold, CN is not required to maintain it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2011/07/04/outer-stations-future-focus-of-meeting |title=Outer Station's future focus of meeting |publisher=The Kingston Whig-Standard |date=2011-07-04 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IT-Pol is primarily concerned with issues that restricts citizens and innovation.
[[File:ITPOLBrusselFlag.jpg|thumb|Members of IT-Pol in the European Parliament]]

=== Censorship ===
Denmark is one of the countries in which most ISPs filters DNS traffic by default. IT-Pol regards this policy as [[censorship]], as the filter filters content that is legal to view in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itpol.polcast.dk/politik/omraade/4 Censur] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Privacy ===
The Danish surveillance law, [[:da:Overvågningsloven|Overvågningsloven]] {{da icon}} was actively fought by IT-Pol.&lt;ref&gt;http://itpoliti.dk/ {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; IT-Pol developed a CD called [[Polippix]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://itpol.polcast.dk/politik/omraade/20 Polippix] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can mitigate most of the Internet related surveillance included in the surveillance law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itpol.polcast.dk/politik/omraade/11 Privatliv og overvågning] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software patents ===
IT-Pol believes [[software patents]] are not beneficial for innovation and therefore fights Software Patents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itpol.polcast.dk/politik/omraade/5 Softwarepatenter] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Copyright ===
IT-Pol believes the balance between society and rights holder should be pushed more towards the society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itpol.polcast.dk/politik/omraade/7 Ophavsret] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital Rights Management ===
IT-Pol believes [[Digital Rights Management]] causes problems for normal citizens and therefore is not in the interest of the citizens. IT-Pol therefore fights DRM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itpol.polcast.dk/politik/omraade/9 Digital Rights Management] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Open Standards ===
IT-Pol believes [[open standards]] will foster innovation and remove lock-in. IT-Pol therefore promotes Open Standards and fights proprietary standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itpol.polcast.dk/politik/omraade/10 Åbne standarder] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== E-voting ===
IT-Pol believes [[E-voting]] should only be allowed if the election has an analog [[audit trail]] (paper trail).&lt;ref&gt;[http://itpol.polcast.dk/politik/omraade/6 E-valg] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use of IT in the public sector ===
IT-Pol believes the [[public sector]] should use IT that makes interoperation with the citizens easier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itpol.polcast.dk/politik/omraade/12 Offentlig IT] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spam ===

'''I Am Equal''' is a photo documentary created by Jason Beckett and fashion photographer Matt Spencer in late 2009. The project has the stated intention of collecting more than 100,000 individual photos from 175 cities around the world and using them to build one of the largest photo mosaics in history.&lt;ref name="Fox13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://downtown.fox13now.com/content/i-am-equal-project-utah|title=I AM EQUAL Project in Utah|last=Green-Miner|first=Brittany|date=2011-02-05|work=|access-date=2018-01-01|archive-url=https://archive.fo/p95gX|archive-date=2013-01-23|dead-url=yes|publisher=FOX 13 Now Downtown SLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the project launched the official world tour in [[Sacramento, California]].&lt;ref name=CapRadio1 /&gt; The project is estimated to take more than 7 years to complete and has the ultimate goal of unveiling an 8,000sq/ft mosaic in Washington DC containing all the photos collected during the world tour.&lt;ref name=SLTribune1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox401 /&gt;

==History==
The  documentary was created by Jason Beckett and fashion photographer Matt Spencer who said the campaign was meant to encourage individuals to get more active in educating, inspiring, and empowering their friends and family to make a positive difference in their communities and the world.&lt;ref name=thatssogay /&gt;

===The Project===
Created in [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]] in late 2009, the campaign was developed in response to the founder's perceptions of a general social apathy prevailing in the world.&lt;ref name=CapRadio1&gt;Jeffery Callison (January 4, 2011) [http://www.capradio.org/156913 "Insight Radio Interview"], Capital Public Radio&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SLTribune1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox401 /&gt; They built the documentary with the intention of giving participants a reason to talk about the unique issues or causes they support, and to encourage those participants to take an active roll in improving their community.&lt;ref name=thatssogay /&gt;

In December 2009  Beckett and   Spencer  conceptualized the documentary project as a world tour campaign that would visit approximately 25 cities a year for 7 years and capture as many as 100,000&lt;ref name=SLTribune1&gt;Rosemary Winters (2011). [http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=13427146&amp;itype=storyID "SLC-based photo project spreads message of equality"], Salt Lake Tribune&lt;/ref&gt; individual photos of people from all walks of life.&lt;ref name=Jasper2 /&gt;

Beginning in January 2010,  Spencer started taking photos and testing the concept at his studio in Salt Lake City, Utah with only a few dozen photos at a time while  Beckett started to build the associated websites and social media pages .&lt;ref name=thatssogay /&gt;

In January 2011, after 8 small events in Utah, the project launched its official world tour in [[Sacramento, California]] at The Citizen Hotel.&lt;ref name=SLTribune1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox401 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Outword1&gt;Andrew Windchanz (January 2011) [http://anax8a.pressmart.com/Outword/index.aspx?issue=issue28&amp;page=11 "I Am Equal: The Picture of Equality Launches in Sacramento"], Outword Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Photos====
To participate in the campaign, individuals are encouraged to wear a solid brightly colored shirt and go to a public photo event&lt;ref&gt;Tony Hobday (February 2011) [http://qsaltlake.com/2011/02/03/we-are-equal/ "We Are Equal"], QSalt Lake Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; in their area where a temporary tattoo with the logo "I AM =" is applied to the palm of their hand.&lt;ref name=Fox13 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jasper2 /&gt; They stand in front of the camera with the instructions to have the palm of their hand facing the camera as close to the face as possible, and they may be as creative as they want.&lt;ref name=CapRadio1 /&gt; The photographer snaps the photo and the entire process takes less than 5 minutes.&lt;ref name=Fox13 /&gt; Two weeks after the photo event, each participant receives an email with instructions on how to find their photo in the online gallery and social networks along with ideas on how to share it with friends and family. Each individual is also invited to share a "PhotoStory" as part of the photo essay project, where participants discuss the unique issues and causes they support.&lt;ref name=CapRadio1 /&gt;

====Broad inclusion====
The project creators said it is their first priority to ensure that it represents all people, issues, and causes rather than just the popular equality topic of the day.&lt;ref name=SLCTribune2&gt;Rosemary Winters (2011). [http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/blogslgbt/51191161-61/project-rights-equality-lake.html.csp "Equality photo project coming to SLC"], Salt Lake City Tribune&lt;/ref&gt; The expressed intention of the campaign is to get participants to speak up and discuss, with friends and family, the humanitarian, civil rights, conservation, and equality issues they support.&lt;ref name=thatssogay /&gt; They   point out that through history the conversation of "equality" has had many causal champions such as the Women's [[Women's suffrage in the United States|Suffragette Movement]], the [[Abolitionism|Abolitionist movement]], the [[Women's rights|Women's Rights movement]], the [[Civil Rights]], and the [[Gay rights in the United States|Gay &amp; Lesbian movement]], so the I Am Equal Photo Documentary was built to connect all of the issues of equality, human rights, civil liberties, and conservation into one massive conversation of mutual respect for all people while uniting individual participants in a common initiative to break a world record.&lt;ref name=CapRadio1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SLTribune1 /&gt;

Some of the issues and causes already represented by individuals participating in the I AM EQUAL Photo Documentary include autism, marriage equality, drug addiction, immigration reform, atheism, religious freedom, teen suicide, Downs Syndrome, gender equality, racism, poverty, incest rape, gay adoption, deaf/hearing impaired, bigotry, pansexuality, obesity, free speech, senior rights.&lt;ref name=Outword1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SLCTribune2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=QVegas1 /&gt;

====Photo activism====
The campaign leverages the popularity of   [[social networks]] to fuel the viral expansion of the project;   participants are encouraged to use their photo on  social media networks&lt;ref name=SLTribune1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=thatssogay /&gt; as a way to initiate conversations about the issue or cause represented by the individual.&lt;ref name=CapRadio1 /&gt; Some participants have taken their photo beyond the social networks by printing it on business cards or framing it in their house as a way to open a casual dialogue about their participation in the campaign.&lt;ref name=Fox401 /&gt;

The project founders assert that the simple act of sharing the photo or putting it on display may be all that is needed to open new conversations with co-workers, friends, family, and even perfect strangers about the big and small issues that these participants feel are facing the world today.&lt;ref name=CapRadio1 /&gt; Some participants have suggested that their I AM EQUAL photo has been an effective way to begin a dialogue on weightier human rights issues such as [[female genital mutilation]], [[sex trafficking]], [[Incest|rape incest]], [[polygamy]], and many other topics they feel would not normally be discussed in casual conversations.&lt;ref name=Fox401 /&gt;

===Milestones===

====World Tour 2011 (Year 1)====
In conjunction with Mayor Kevin Johnson's office and coordinating with the local Pride! Center, [[NAACP]], [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of America|Big Brothers Big Sisters]], and the [[United Way of America|United Way]], the photo documentary launched its first official tour stop on January 6, 2011, at The Citizen Hotel in Sacramento, California, the city TIME Magazine voted it to be the most diverse city in America.&lt;ref name=CapRadio1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox401 /&gt;

The project returned to Salt Lake City and held a general public photo event on February 5, 2011, at The Sheraton Downtown Hotel&lt;ref name=Fox13 /&gt; where an additional 650 photos were added to the documentary collection. The project made its way to Las Vegas, Nevada, in partnership with [[MGM Resorts International]]&lt;ref name=QVegas1&gt;Staff Writer (February 2011) [http://issuu.com/qvegas/docs/qvegas_february_2011/13 "I AM EQUAL Project comes to Las Vegas"], Q Vegas Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; for an event at [[New York-New York Hotel and Casino|The New York New York Hotel &amp; Casino]] on February 19, 2011, where more than 500 resort employees participated in the documentary project along with the then Mayor [[Oscar Goodman]], County Commissioner [[Chris Giunchigliani]], the dance troop The [[JabbaWockeeZ|Jabbawockeez]], as well as [[Terry Fator]], and the Las Vegas cast of [[The Lion King]] at Mandalay Bay. While in Las Vegas, project founder Jason Beckett was invited to discuss the photo documentary project as a speaker at the annual [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day|Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] celebrations, Jazzitudes at UNLV.&lt;ref name="rebel"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lister|first=Nolan|title=Black history celebration channels ‘dream’|publisher=UNLV Rebel Yell|date=2011-02-24|url=http://unlvrebelyell.com/2011/02/24/black-history-celebration-channels-%E2%80%98dream%E2%80%99/|accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project made its first stop outside the United States in Calgary, Alberta, Canada   on May 28, 2011. During this stop, hundreds participated in the project including United States Olympic Gold Medalist, [[Steve Mesler]] on behalf of his non-profit organization Classroom Champions. Local service groups and organizations including the [[United Way of Canada]], Child Find Alberta, AIDS Calgary, and the Calgary Scope Society all participated in the documentary project.&lt;ref name="thatssogay"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kassa|first=Hanna|title=I AM EQUAL project in Calgary |publisher=That's So Gay|date=2011-05-19|url=http://cjsw.com/program/thats-so-gay/i-am-equal-project-calgary/|accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with the North Texas chapter of Get Equal, the I Am Equal Photo Documentary set up at the Aloft Dallas Hotel and took photos of more than 300 people. Project founder   Beckett was invited to address the assembled crowd at the annual North Texas March for Equality on the steps of City Hall as the keynote speaker for the event.&lt;ref name="NTDaily"&gt;{{cite news|last=Macon|first=Alex|title=March in downtown Dallas promotes rights for LGBT community|publisher=NT Daily|date=2011-05-29|url=http://www.ntdaily.com/?p=55481|accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====World Tour 2012 (Year 2)====
The   project was invited to the University of North Florida   as part of their first annual 'Week of One' diversity celebration, created in part as a vehicle to showcase the   project and allow students the opportunity to take part in the record-breaking campaign.&lt;ref name="arbus1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wagner |first=Madeleine|title=Beauty In Diversity = I AMEQUAL At UNF |publisher=ARBUS Magazine|date=December 2011 – January 2012|url=http://vpub.boyd-printing.com/display_article.php?id=913642|accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, the campaign made stops in Raleigh, North Carolina, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Columbus, Ohio. While in Tennessee, the project founders made a detour to stop in the small town of Whitwell&lt;ref name="Jasper2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Doss|first=Nicholas|title=Whitwell participates in record breaking photo documentary |publisher=Jasper Journal|date=March 6, 2012|url=http://marioncountynews.net/whitwell-participates-in-record-breaking-photo-documentary-p2628-98.htm|accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; to include this community of 1,600 people in the project. The founders wanted to include the people responsible for creating the Children's Holocaust Memorial ([[Paper Clips Project]]), created by students at the local middle school who collected more than 11 million paperclips from around the world and placed them into a rail car used to transport Jews, blacks, homosexuals, Jehova's Witnesses, and other people to concentration camps. The original teacher from the project, David Alan Smith, as well as the local elected and school officials took part in the campaign by getting their photo taken at the City Hall Court Room.&lt;ref name="Jasper1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Doss|first=Nicholas|title=Whitwell to host record breaking photo shoot for documentary |publisher=Jasper Journal|date=February 21, 2012|url=http://marioncountynews.net/whitwell-to-host-record-breaking-photo-shoot-for-documentary-p2610-98.htm|accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 }}The '''Internet Gambling Regulation, Consumer Protection, and Enforcement Act''' was a proposed 2009 bill in the [[United States House of Representatives]] that is intended "to provide for the licensing of Internet gambling activities by the Secretary of the Treasury, to provide for consumer protections on the Internet, to enforce the tax code, and for other purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR02267:@@@T|title=HR2267|publisher=Library of Congress|date=2009-06-12|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bill was originally introduced by [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Barney Frank]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Massachusetts|MA]]) on June 12, 2009 and as of July 20, 2009 had bipartisan support from 47 co-sponsors.  The bill was held in the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Financial Services Committee]].

==Description of the bill==
The bill would have found the following:
#"Since the development of the Internet, millions of people have chosen to gamble online, and today Internet gambling is offered by operators located in many different countries under a variety of licensing and regulatory regimes."
#"Despite the increasing use of the Internet for gambling by persons in the United States, there is no Federal or State regulatory regime in place to protect United States citizens who choose to engage in this interstate activity, or to oversee operators to establish and enforce standards of integrity and fairness."
#"In the United States, gambling activities, equipment, and operations have been subject to various forms of Federal and State control, regulation, and enforcement, with some form of gambling being permitted in nearly every State and by many Indian tribes."
#"Internet gambling in the United States should be controlled by a strict Federal licensing and regulatory framework to protect underage and otherwise vulnerable individuals, to ensure the games are fair, to address the concerns of law enforcement, and to enforce any limitations on the activity established by the States and Indian tribes."
#That entities licensed to provide internet gambling in the United States would have to be heavily regulated and monitored.
#"There is a need to extend the regulatory provisions of this Act to all persons, locations, equipment, practices, and associations related to Internet gambling, with each State and Indian tribe having the ability to limit Internet gambling operators from offering Internet gambling to persons located within its territory by opting out of the provisions of this Act."&lt;ref name = "hr2267"&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.2267:|title=H.R.2267|publisher=Library of Congress|date=2009-06-12|accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill then discussed the qualifications an organization would need to possess in order to operate an online poker site, legal requirements, fees and taxes, penalties, and regulations.

Had H.R. 2267 passed, it would have automatically created an exception for poker to the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]] (UIGEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.onlinecasinobluebook.com/poker-rooms/legal-status-of-online-poker-in-the-united-states/ | title=Legal Status of Online Poker in the United States | publisher=OCBB | accessdate=28 April 2014 | author=Vaughn, Jake}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the meantime, Frank also proposed another bill, the '''Internet Gambling Regulation, Consumer Protection, and Enforcement Act''' (H.R. 2266) which would have delayed the full implementation of the UIGEA until 2010.

==Reaction==
On July 5, 2009, Frank addressed the players at the [[2009 World Series of Poker]] Main Event (day 1-c) concerning the status of this bill.  During his address, he accused the Republican Party of being behind the [[Southern District of New York Action Against Online Poker Players|Department of Justice's seizure of poker players' bank accounts]] in early June.&lt;ref name = "FRT"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.flopturnriver.com/blogs/barney-frank-addresses-wsop-attendees-on-anti-uigea-bills-1570|title= Barney Frank Addresses WSOP Attendees On Anti-UIGEA Bills|publisher= Flop River Turn |date= 2009-07-08 |accessdate= 2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After his address, Frank initiated the third day of the tournament with the words, "Shuffle up and deal."&lt;ref name = "FRT" /&gt;

[[Goldman Sachs]] issued a notice to its investors that online gambling would be legal in the U.S., and that the only question is when.  They believe that the tax ramifications alone make the passage of regulated poker a foregone conclusion.  "Were the market to be legalized," the Sachs report stated, "we believe that the size of the revenue opportunity could increase materially... Based on an assumption of 30% penetration of offline poker players and $300 gross gaming revenue (GGR) per player, we estimate that a legal poker market could be worth $3bn."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.onlinecasinoreports.com/news/theheadlines/2009/7/9/goldman-sachs-us-to-legalize-online-gambling.php|title=Goldman Sachs: US to Legalize Online Gambling|publisher=Online Casino Reports|last=S|first = Nadav|date = 2009-07-09|accessdate= 2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jural Relationship''' is a type of legal relationship existing between the '''[[landlord]]''' and tenant as long as the valid tenancy shall continue between them with regard to the '''[[Building|demised premises]]'''.
==Introduction==
Before going to analyse the term '''Jural Relationship''' we have to discuss the terminologies about the '''[[Landlord]]''' and '''Tenant''' with reference to the Rent Control Act.&lt;ref&gt;http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Landlord+and+Tenant&lt;/ref&gt; So it is better to take into assistance of two enactments from the State of '''[[Tamil Nadu]]''' and the Union Territory of '''[[Puducherry|Pondicherry]]'''. The phraseology of the said Acts are: (1) '''''The [[Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1960]] [Tamil Nadu Act No. XVIII of 1960]'''''. and (2) '''''The Puducherry Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1969 [Puducherry Act No. V of 1969]'''''.&lt;br /&gt;

==Definitions==
The term '''[[Landlord]]'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/628271/&lt;/ref&gt; with reference to the '''[[Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1960]]''' under Section 2(6) which runs as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;''Sec.2(6) landlord includes the person who is receiving or is entitled to receive the rent of a building, whether on his own account or on behalf of another or on behalf of himself and others or as an agent, trustee, executor, administrator, receiver or guardian or who would so receive the rent to be entitled to receive the rent, if the building were let to a tenant:''&lt;br /&gt;
''Explanation: A tenant who sub-let shall be deemed to be a landlord within the meaning of this Act in relation to the sub-tenant.''&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;Likewise the term '''Tenant'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/1502174/&lt;/ref&gt; with reference to the Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act, 1960 under Section 2(8) which runs as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;''(8) "tenant" means any person by whom or on whose account rent is payable for a building and includes the surviving spouse, or any son, or daughter, or the legal representative of a deceased tenant who-''&lt;br /&gt;
''(i) in the case of a residential building, had been living with the tenant in the building as a member of the tenant's family upto the death of the tenant, and''&lt;br /&gt;
''(ii) in the case of a non-residential building, had been in continuous association with the tenant for the purpose of carrying on business of the, tenant upto the death of the tenant and continues to carry on such business thereafter, and ''&lt;br /&gt;
''a person continuing in possession after the termination of the tenancy in his favour, but does not include a person placed in occupation of a building by its tenant or a person to whom the collection of rents or fees in a public market, cart stand or slaughter-house or of rents for shops, has been framed out or leased by a Municipal Council or a Panchayat Union Council or the Municipal Corporation of Madras or the Municipal Corporation of Madurai.''&lt;br /&gt;

==Discussions==
As stated above as long as the existence of valid tenancy between the parties then they are implied to be discharging their part of statutory obligations of '''"give and take"''' policy of '''"payments of rent"''' and '''"receipt of rent"''' towards the '''[[Building|demised premises]]''' and that of '''amenities''' attached with the demised premises.&lt;br /&gt;

So as long as the parties are "paying and receiving" the '''rents''' then they are comes under a single roof of '''landlord and tenant''' for which it is pertinent point to go through the landmark decision dated 7 August 2009 as rendered by the Hon'ble '''[[Madras High Court]]''' in its Judgment in '''''M.S.Venkatesh Kumar and another Vs. M/s.Prasath Associates''''' which is reported in '''2001(4) CTC 371''' in para 9 has held as follows: '''''"the term "Rent" would include all payments agreed to be paid by the tenant to his landlord for the use and occupation, not only of the building and furniture, but also for electricity, water and other amenities and that in other words, any sum of money which the tenant agrees to pay as consideration for the tenancy would be rent. So, in the aforesaid judgments rendered by this Court and the Honourable Apex Court it has been categorically mentioned that the rent means any sum of money as agreed as rent and other amenities payable for the occupation of the tenant in the demised premises."'''''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/213034/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Similarly in yet another decision the Hon'ble '''[[Madras High Court]]''' further held that, '''''"the term "amenity" shall means and includes as follows: “Any facility afforded for the pleasurable enjoyment by the tenants of the premises would constitute an amenity"''''' which is reported in '''1972 TLNJ 186'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4490">The '''Law Commission of Canada''' was an independent [[law commission]] that gave advice to the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] on matters of [[law]]. The body was created in 1971 as the '''Law Reform Commission of Canada''' and was disbanded in 1992. The body was reestablished as the Law Commission of Canada in 1996.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Retooling the Humanities: The Culture of Research in Canadian Universities|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2zx6MYbtGmcC|publisher = University of Alberta|date = 2011-01-01|isbn = 9780888645418|language = en|first = Daniel|last = Coleman|first2 = Smaro|last2 = Kamboureli}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 26, 2006, the [[Premiership of Stephen Harper|Conservative government]] announced it was cutting the LCC's funding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==

=== Law Reform Commission of Canada ===
Decades before it was established, since at least 1955, there were calls for the creation of a federal law reform commission.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/abt-apd/icg-gci/lr-rd/lr-rd.pdf|title = Law Reform Agencies|last = Murphy|first = Gavin|date = 2004|journal = Department of Justice Canada|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal law commission was preceded by the Ontario Law Reform Commission, which was created in 1964.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1966, the [[Canadian Bar Association]] passed a resolution at its annual meeting calling for the creation of a federal law reform commission.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On February 16, 1970, the then [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Minister of Justice]] [[John Turner]] introduced Bill C-186, which called for the establishment of a national law reform agency. The bill successfully passed and the Law Reform Commission of Canada was created.

The LRCC was meant to provide expert advice on reformations of legislation. It was to study and review on an ongoing basis the laws of Canada, and to make recommendations for their improvement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

No legislation based on the LRCC's recommendations were enacted during the first ten years of the Commission's existence. The Commission did not issue a final report until its fifth year. Finally, in 1983, legislation was enacted that implemented one of its reports.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In February 1992, the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative government]] announced that it was to close the LRCC, along with five other organisations, as a cost savings measure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Law Commission of Canada ===
In 1996, [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] Minister of Justice [[Allan Rock]] reintroduced Bill C-9 to create the Law Commission of Canada.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On May 29, 1996, Bill C-9 received royal assent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The LCC commenced operations during 1997. Its mandate was different than under the former LRCC. The LCC was meant to be inclusive to Canadians, and to adopt a multidisciplinary approach. It was made up of five commissioners appointed by the [[Cabinet of Canada]] on the recommendations of the Minister of Justice. The president was a full-time commissioner, while the other four commissioners served on a part-time basis.

In 2002, it released a report recommending Parliament remove restrictions on same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tories chop two legal programs|url = http://www.lawtimesnews.com/200610021298/headline-news/tories-chop-two-legal-programs|website = Law Times News|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, it released a report on electoral reform that suggested introducing mixed member proportional representation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Demise ====
On September 26, 2006, the Federal Government announced it would be cutting funding for the LCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CBC News In Depth: Budget cuts|url = http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/parliament39/budgetcuts-list.html|website = CBC News|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It said that the cuts would save $4.19 million for the government over the next two years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Legal tender''' is a medium of [[payment]] recognized by a legal system to be valid for meeting a financial obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}} Legal tender refers to that form of money which has been approved by the government as a legal form of exchange and has been guaranteed by the government to have a legal status to repay debts or exchange against some good or commodity.&lt;/ref&gt; Paper [[currency]] and [[coin]]s are common forms of legal tender in many countries.  Legal tender is variously defined in different [[jurisdiction]]s. Formally, it is anything which when offered in payment extinguishes the debt. Thus, personal [[cheque]]s, [[credit card]]s, and similar non-cash methods of payment are not usually legal tender. The law does not relieve the debt obligation until payment is tendered. [[Coin]]s and [[banknote]]s are usually defined as legal tender. Some jurisdictions may forbid or restrict payment made other than by legal tender. For example, such a law might outlaw the use of foreign coins and bank notes or require a [[license]] to perform [[financial transaction]]s in a foreign currency.

Generally, designation of a particular form of money as legal tender means "that the designated money is valid payment for all debts unless there is a specific agreement to the contrary".&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. Horvitz, ''Monetary Policy and the Financial System'', p. 14, Prentice-Hall, 3rd ed. (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions legal tender can be refused as payment if no debt exists prior to the time of payment (where the obligation to pay may arise at the same time as the offer of payment). For example, [[vending machine]]s and transport staff do not have to accept the largest denomination of banknote. Shopkeepers may reject large banknotes: this is covered by the legal concept known as [[invitation to treat]].{{clarify|date=August 2018}} Under the law, United States money as identified above is a valid and legal offer of payment for antecedent debts when tendered to a creditor. By contrast, federal statutes do not require that someone who is not a pre-existing creditor must accept currency or coins as payment for goods or services. Private businesses may formulate their own policies on whether to accept cash unless state law requires otherwise.&lt;ref name=LTSFAQ/&gt;&lt;ref name="FRBFAQ"/&gt;

The right, in many jurisdictions, of a trader to refuse to do business with any person, means a purchaser may not insist on making a purchase and so declaring a legal tender in law, as anything other than an offered payment for debts already incurred would not be effective.

==Etymology==
The term "legal tender" is from Middle English ''tendren'', French ''tendre'' (verb form), meaning ''to offer''. The ''Latin'' root is ''tendere'' (to stretch out), and the sense of ''tender'' as an ''offer'' is related to the etymology of the English word "extend" (to hold outward).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tender Definition of '''tender''' as verb, in Merriam-Webster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424175942/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tender |date=24 April 2009 }}. Retrieved 13 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Withdrawal and replacement of legal tender==

===Demonetisation===
{{See also|Monetisation|Remonetisation|Withdrawal of low-denomination coins}}
Demonetization is the act of stripping a currency unit of its status as legal tender. It occurs whenever there is a change of national currency: The current form or forms of money is pulled from circulation and retired, often to be replaced with new notes or coins. Sometimes, a country completely replaces the old currency with new currency.

The opposite of demonetization is remonetization, in which a form of payment is restored as legal tender.



Coins and banknotes may cease to be legal tender if new notes of the same [[currency]] replace them or if a new currency is introduced replacing the former one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cross|first=Bill|title=Dollar Default: How the Federal Reserve and the Government Betrayed Your Trust|year=2012|isbn=9781475261080|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this are:

*The United Kingdom, adopting [[decimalisation|decimal]] currency in place of pounds, shillings, and pence in 1971, Banknotes remained unchanged (except for the replacement of the 10 shilling note by the 50 pence coin). In 1968 and 1969 decimal coins which had precise equivalent values in the old currency (5p, 10p, 50p – 1, 2, and 10 shillings respectively) were introduced, while decimal coins with no precise equivalent (½p, 1p, 2p – equal to 1.2d (old pence), 2.4d, and 4.8d respectively) were introduced on 15 February 1971. The smallest and largest non-decimal circulating coins, the half penny and half crown, were withdrawn in 1969, and the other non-decimal coins with no precise equivalent in the new currency (1d, 3d) were withdrawn later in 1971. Non-decimal coins with precise decimal equivalents (6d&lt;!-- Precise here means an amount which could be made up by coins; there was no way of making 1¼p or 5/12p in coins which 3d and 1d would have been.--&gt; ( = 2½p), 1, and 2 shillings) remained legal tender either until the coins no longer circulated (1980 in the case of the 6d), or the equivalent decimal coins were reduced in size in the early 1990s. The 6d coin was permitted to remain in large circulation throughout the United Kingdom due to the London Underground committee's large investment in coin-operated ticketing machines that used it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Old coins returned to the Royal Mint through the UK banking system will be redeemed by exchanging them for legal tender currency with no time limits; but coins issued before 1947 have a higher value for their silver content than for their monetary value.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
*The [[successor state]]s of the [[Soviet Union]] replacing the [[Soviet ruble]] in the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
*Currencies used in the [[Eurozone]] before being replaced by the [[euro]] are not legal tender, but all banknotes are redeemable for euros for a minimum of 10 years (for certain notes, there is no time limit).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}
*[[2016 Indian banknote demonetisation|India demonetised its 500 and 1000 rupee notes on 8 November 2016.]] This action affected 86 percent of all cash in circulation. The demonetisation action was intended to curb [[Indian black money|black money]], the hoarding of unaccounted cash, and sponsorship of terrorism, but also led to long queues from [[bank run]]s, leaving more than 30 people dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/demonetisation-suicides-heart-attacks-and-even-a-murder-among-33-deaths-since-decision-4378135/|title=Demonetisation: 33 deaths since government scrapped Rs 500, Rs 1000 notes|author=|date=16 November 2016|website=indianexpress.com|accessdate=27 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230194940/http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/demonetisation-suicides-heart-attacks-and-even-a-murder-among-33-deaths-since-decision-4378135/|archivedate=30 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The old notes are now being replaced by new 500 and 2000 rupee notes.
*The Philippines has ceased 2 peso and 50 centavo coins of Flora and Fauna Series in 2000, due to overminting of the coins of BSP Series that has not included the 2 peso and 50 centavo coins of that series.

Individual coins or banknotes can be demonetised and cease to be legal tender (for example, the pre-decimal United Kingdom [[History of the farthing|farthing]] or the Bank of England 1 pound note), but the [[Bank of England]] does redeem all Bank of England banknotes by exchanging them for legal tender currency at its counters in London (or by post) regardless of how old they are. Banknotes issued by retail banks in the UK (Scotland and Northern Ireland) are not legal tender, but one of the criteria for legal protection under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act is that banknotes must be payable on demand, therefore withdrawn notes remain a liability of the issuing bank without any time limits.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

In the case of the euro, coins and banknotes of former national currencies were in some cases considered legal tender from 1 January 1999 until 28 February 2002. Legally, those coins and banknotes were considered non-decimal sub-divisions of the euro.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

When the [[Iraqi Swiss dinar]] ceased to be legal tender in Iraq, it still circulated in the northern Kurdish regions, and despite lacking government backing, it had a stable market value for more than a decade. This example is often cited to demonstrate that the value of a currency is not derived purely from its legal status{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} (but this currency would not be legal tender).

This is also true of the paper money issued by the [[Confederate States of America]] during the [[American Civil War]]. The [[Confederate States of America dollar|Confederate currency]] became worthless by its own terms after the war, since it could only be redeemed a stated number of years after a peace treaty was signed between the Confederacy and the United States (which never happened, as [[Conclusion of the American Civil War|the Confederacy was defeated and dissolved]]).

Demonetisation is currently prohibited in the United States, and the [[Coinage Act of 1965]] applies to all US coins and currency regardless of age. The closest historical equivalent in the US, other than Confederate money, was from 1933 to 1974, when the government banned most private ownership of gold bullion, including gold coins held for non-[[numismatics|numismatic]] purposes. Now, however, even surviving pre-1933 gold coins are legal tender under the 1964 act.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Withdrawal from circulation===
Banknotes and coins may be withdrawn from circulation, but remain legal tender. United States banknotes issued at any date remain legal tender even after they are withdrawn from circulation. Canadian 1- and 2-dollar bills remain legal tender even if they have been withdrawn and replaced by coins, but Canadian $1,000 bills remain legal tender even if they are removed from circulation as they arrive at a bank. However, Bank of England notes that are withdrawn from circulation generally cease to be legal tender but remain redeemable for current currency at the Bank of England itself or by post. All paper and polymer issues of [[New Zealand]] banknotes issued from 1967 onwards (and 1- and 2-dollar notes until 1993) are still legal tender; however, 1-, 2- and 5-cent coins are no longer used in [[New Zealand]].

===Cashless society===
{{Main|Cashless society}}
A cashless society describes an economic state whereby [[financial transaction]]s are not conducted with money in the form of physical [[banknote]]s or coins, but rather through the transfer of digital information (usually an electronic representation of money) between the transacting parties.&lt;ref name="THE COST OF CASH IN THE UNITED STATES"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fletcher.tufts.edu/CostofCash/~/media/Fletcher/Microsites/Cost%20of%20Cash/CostofCashStudyFinal.pdf|publisher=The Fletcher School Tufts University|title=THE COST OF CASH IN THE UNITED STATES|page=9|accessdate=17 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201110118/http://fletcher.tufts.edu/CostofCash/%7E/media/Fletcher/Microsites/Cost%20of%20Cash/CostofCashStudyFinal.pdf|archivedate=1 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cashless societies have existed, based on [[barter]] and other methods of exchange, and cashless transactions have also become possible using [[digital currencies]] such as [[bitcoin]]. However this article discusses{{fix|text=self-reference?|link=Wp:selfref|cat=[[category:articles containing self-references]]|date=August 2018}}and focuses on the term "cashless society" in the sense of a move towards, and implications of, a society where cash is replaced by its [[digital currency|digital equivalent]] – in other words, legal tender (money) exists, is recorded, and is exchanged only in electronic digital form.

==Commemorative issues==
Sometimes currency issues such as commemorative coins or transfer bills may be issued that are not intended for public circulation but are nonetheless legal tender. An example of such currency is [[Maundy money]]. Some currency issuers, particularly the Scottish banks, issue special commemorative banknotes which are intended for ordinary circulation (though no Scottish banknotes nor notes from Northern Ireland are legal tender in the United Kingdom). As well, some standard coins are minted on higher-quality dies as 'uncirculated' versions of the coin, for collectors to purchase at a premium; these coins are nevertheless legal tender. Some countries issue precious-metal coins which have a currency value indicated on them which is far below the value of the metal the coin contains: these coins are known as "[[non-circulating legal tender]]" or "NCLT".

==Status by country==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the creation of legal tender, in the form of notes and [[base metal]] coins, is the exclusive right of the Commonwealth (Federal) Government. According to section 115 of the [[Australian Constitution]], "A State shall not coin money, nor make anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of debts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s115.html |title=COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA CONSTITUTION ACT – SECT 115 States not to coin money |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111115818/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s115.html |archivedate=11 November 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this provision the [[Perth Mint]], owned by the [[Western Australia]]n Government, still produces gold and silver coins with legal tender status, the [[Australian Gold Nugget]] and [[Australian Silver Kookaburra]]. These, however, although having the status of legal tender, are almost never circulated or used in payment of debts, and are mostly considered [[bullion coin]]s.

Australian notes are legal tender for all amounts, as established by the ''Reserve Bank Act 1959''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A07384 Reserve Bank Act 1959] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310015152/http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A07384 |date=10 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the provisions of the ''Currency Act 1965'' Australian coins intended for general circulation, which are now produced at the [[Royal Australian Mint]] in [[Canberra]], are also legal tender, but only for the following amounts:
*not exceeding 20¢ if 1¢ and/or 2¢ coins are offered;
*not exceeding $5 if any of 5¢, 10¢, 20¢ and 50¢ coins are offered;
*not exceeding 10 times the face value if the coins offered are greater than 50¢ up to and including $10;

The one cent and two cent coins have been [[Withdrawal of low-denomination coins|withdrawn from circulation]] since February 1992 but remain legal tender.&lt;ref name=rbalegaltender /&gt;

Although the Reserve Bank Act 1959 and the Currency Act 1965 establishes that Australian banknotes and coins have legal tender status, Australian banknotes and coins do not necessarily have to be used in transactions and refusal to accept payment in legal tender is not unlawful. It appears that a provider of goods or services is at liberty to set the commercial terms upon which payment will take place before the "contract" for supply of the goods or services is entered into.  If a provider of goods or services specifies other means of payment prior to the contract, then there is usually no obligation for legal tender to be accepted as payment. This is the case even when an existing debt is involved. However, refusal to accept legal tender in payment of an existing debt, where no other means of payment/settlement has been specified in advance, conceivably could have consequences in legal proceedings.&lt;ref name=rbalegaltender&gt;{{cite web |url=http://banknotes.rba.gov.au/legal/legal-tender/ |title=RBA Banknotes: Legal Tender |publisher=Rba.gov.au |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213015111/http://banknotes.rba.gov.au/legal/legal-tender/ |archivedate=13 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rba.gov.au/ |title=Reserve Bank of Australia – Home Page |publisher=Rba.gov.au |date= |accessdate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502014757/http://www.rba.gov.au/ |archivedate=2 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
In 1901, notes in circulation in [[Australia]] consisted of bank notes payable in gold coin and issued by the trading banks, and Queensland Treasury notes. Bank notes circulated in all States except [[Queensland]], but were not legal tender except for a brief period in 1893 in [[New South Wales]]. There were, however, some restrictions on their issue and other provisions for the protection of the public. Queensland Treasury notes were issued by the Queensland Government and were legal tender in that state. Notes of both categories continued in circulation until 1910, when the [[Commonwealth Parliament]] passed the ''Australian Notes Act 1910'' and the ''Bank Notes Tax Act 1910''. The ''Australian Notes Act 1910'' prohibited the circulation of state notes as money, and the ''Bank Notes Tax Act 1910'' imposed a tax of ten per cent, per annum, on "all bank notes issued or re-issued by any bank in the Commonwealth after the commencement of this Act, and not redeemed".{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} These Acts effectively put an end to the issue of notes by the trading banks and the Queensland Treasury. ''The Reserve Bank Act 1959'' expressly prohibits persons and states from issuing "a bill or note for the payment of money payable to bearer on demand and intended for circulation".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Canada===
In general, [[Canadian dollar]] banknotes issued by the [[Bank of Canada]] and coins issued under the authority of the [[Royal Canadian Mint Act]] are legal tender in [[Canada]].  However, commercial transactions may legally be settled in any manner agreed by the parties involved with the transactions. For example, convenience stores may refuse $100 bank notes if they feel that would put them at risk of being [[counterfeit]] victims; however, official policy suggests that the retailers should evaluate the impact of that approach. In the case that no mutually acceptable form of payment can be found for the tender, the parties involved should seek legal advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/count-contre/faq-eng.htm |title=Currency Counterfeiting – Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Rcmp-grc.gc.ca |date=10 July 2006 |accessdate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322213713/http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/count-contre/faq-eng.htm |archivedate=22 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As outlined in the Currency Act, there is a limit to the value of a transaction for which one may use only coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-52/index.html |title=Canada's currency act |accessdate=8 July 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616023437/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-52/index.html |archivedate=16 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A payment in coins is a legal tender for no more than the following amounts for the following denominations of coins:

#forty dollars if the denomination is two dollars or greater but does not exceed ten dollars;
#twenty-five dollars if the denomination is one dollar;
#ten dollars if the denomination is ten cents or greater but less than one dollar;
#five dollars if the denomination is five cents; and
#twenty-five cents if the denomination is one cent.

In the case of coins of a denomination greater than ten dollars, a payment is a legal tender for no more than the value of a single coin of that denomination. Where more than one amount is payable by one person to another on the same day under one or more obligations, the total of those amounts is deemed to be one amount due and payable on that day.

===China===
In the People's Republic of China, the official currency [[renminbi]] serves as the unlimited legal tender for all transactions. It is by law that any public institution or individual must not refuse using the currency to settle public or private domestic owing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 中华人民共和国人民币管理条例|url = http://www.pbc.gov.cn/rhwg/000101f.htm|website = www.pbc.gov.cn|access-date = 13 February 2016|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151223142417/http://www.pbc.gov.cn/rhwg/000101f.htm|archivedate = 23 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eurozone===
[[Euro]] [[euro coins|coins]] and [[euro banknotes|banknotes]] became legal tender in most countries of the [[Eurozone]] on 1 January 2002. Although one side of the coins is used for different national marks for each country, all coins and all banknotes are legal tender throughout the [[eurozone]]. Therefore, it is possible to find [[Irish euro coins]] in [[Greece]] and [[Finnish euro coins]] in [[Portugal]], for instance. Although some eurozone countries do not put 1 cent and 2 cent coins into general circulation (prices in those countries are by general understanding always [[cash rounding|rounded to whole multiples of 5 cent]]), 1 cent and 2 cent coins from other eurozone countries remain legal tender in those countries.

Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 limits the number of coins that can be offered for payment to fifty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=11 May 1998|title=Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro|journal=Official Journal of the European Communities|volume=41|issue=L 139|pages=1–5|issn=0378-6978|oclc=104948742|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1998:139:0001:0005:EN:PDF|format=PDF|accessdate=3 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments that issue the coins must establish the euro as the only legal tender. Due to variations on the legislative meaning of legal tender in various member states and the ability of contract law to overrule the status of legal tender, it is possible for merchants to choose to refuse to accept euro banknotes and coins within specific countries within the Eurozone (the Netherlands, Germany, Finland and Ireland).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; National laws may also impose restrictions as to maximal amounts that can be settled by coins or notes.

===France===
Legal tender was enacted the first time for gold and silver coins in the [[French Penal Code]] of 1807 (art. 475, 11°). In 1870, legal tender was extended to all notes of the [[Banque de France]]. Anyone refusing such monies for their whole value would be prosecuted ([[French Penal Code]] art. R. 642-3).

===Republic of Ireland===
{{See also|Coinage of the Republic of Ireland}}
According to the ''Economic and Monetary Union Act, 1998'' of the [[Republic of Ireland]] which replaced the legal tender provisions that had been re-enacted in Irish legislation from previous British enactments, "No person, other than the [[Central Bank of Ireland]] and such persons as may be designated by the Minister by order, shall be obliged to accept more than 50 coins denominated in euro or in cent in any single transaction."

====Irish history====
The ''Decimal Currency Act, 1970'' governed legal tender prior to the adoption of the euro and laid down the analogous provisions as in United Kingdom legislation (all inherited from previous [[Law of the United Kingdom|British law]]), namely: coins denominated above 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding 10 pounds, coins denominated not more than 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding 5 pounds, and bronze coins became legal tender for payment not exceeding 20 pence.

===India===
The [[Indian rupee]] is the ''de facto'' legal tender currency in [[India]]. The Indian rupee is also legal tender in [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]], but the [[Nepalese rupee]] and [[Bhutanese ngultrum]] are not legal tender in India. Both the Nepalese rupee and Bhutanese ngultrum are pegged with the Indian rupee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.country-data.com/frd/cs/bhutan/bt_glos.html |title=Area handbook Series/ Bhutan (Nepal and Bhutan) / Glossary |publisher=Country-data.com |date= |accessdate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909072407/http://www.country-data.com/frd/cs/bhutan/bt_glos.html |archivedate=9 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian rupee used to be an official currency of other countries, including the [[Straits Settlements]] (now [[Singapore]] and parts of [[Malaysia]]), [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]], and the [[Trucial States]] (now the [[UAE]]).

In 1837, the Indian rupee was made the sole official currency of the Straits Settlements, as it was administered as a part of India. In 1845, the British replaced the Indian rupee with the [[Straits dollar]] after administration of the Straits Settlements separated from India earlier in that same year.

[[File:RBI 5-rupee note, overprinted Government of Pakistan, 1947.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Indian rupees were stamped with Government of Pakistan to be used as legal tenders in the new state of Pakistan in 1947.]]
After [[Partition of India|partition of India and Pakistan in 1947]], the [[Pakistani rupee]] came into existence, initially using Indian coins and Indian currency notes simply overstamped with the word "Pakistan". New coins and banknotes were issued in 1948.

The Gulf rupee, also known as the [[Gulf rupee|Persian Gulf rupee]] (XPGR), was introduced by the [[Government of India]] as a replacement for the Indian rupee for circulation exclusively outside the country with the [[Reserve Bank of India]] Amendment Act of 1 May 1959. This creation of a separate currency was an attempt to reduce the strain put on India's foreign reserves by gold smuggling.

Two states, Kuwait and Bahrain eventually replaced the Gulf rupee with their own currencies (the [[Kuwaiti dinar]] and the [[Bahraini dinar]]) after gaining independence from Britain in 1961 and 1965, respectively.

On 6 June 1966, India devalued the rupee. To avoid following this devaluation, several of the states using the rupee adopted their own currencies. Qatar and most of the Trucial States adopted the [[Qatari riyal|Qatar and Dubai riyal]], whilst Abu Dhabi adopted the [[Bahraini dinar]]. Only Oman continued to use the Gulf rupee until 1970, with the government backing the currency at its old peg to the pound. Oman later replaced the Gulf rupee with its own [[Omani rial|rial]] in 1970.

On 8 November 2016, [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Narendra Modi]] announced that existing [[Indian 500 and 1000 rupee currency demonetisation|INR 500 and INR 1000 banknotes would no longer be accepted as legal tender]] with a view to curb counterfeiting, tax evasion and the [[black money|parallel economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/the-reputation-of-india-as-a-soft-state-is-over/|title=The reputation of India as a soft state is over|work=The Indian Express|first=Sudhanshu|last=Trivedi|date=6 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623083911/http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/the-reputation-of-india-as-a-soft-state-is-over/|archivedate=23 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reserve Bank of India outlined a scheme for holders of such banknotes to either deposit them into their bank accounts for full, unlimited value, or to exchange the banknotes for new, subject to a cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://finmin.nic.in/172521.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109223029/http://finmin.nic.in/172521.pdf |archivedate=9 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand]] has a complex history of legal tender. English law applied, as applicable to local circumstances, from either 6 January 1840, when the Governor of New South Wales by proclamation annexed New Zealand, or from 14 January 1840 when Captain Hobson Royal Navy was sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor. The English Laws Act 1858 subsequently confirmed that English legislation passed prior to 14 January 1840 was and had been the law of New Zealand, as applicable to local circumstances. 
The (UK) Coinage Act 1816 therefore applied and British coins were confirmed as legal tender in [[New Zealand]]. Unusually, until 1989, the Reserve Bank did not have the right to issue coins as legal tender. Coins had to be issued by the [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]].

The history of bank notes was considerably more complex. In 1840, the [[Union Bank of Australia]] started issuing bank notes under provisions of British law, but these were not automatically legal tender.

In 1844, ordinances were passed making the [[ANZ Bank New Zealand#History|Union Bank]] banknotes legal tender and authorising the government to issue debentures in small denominations, thus creating two sets of legal tender. These debentures were circulated but were traded at a discount to their face value because of distrust of the colonial government by the settler population. In 1845, the Ordinance was disallowed by the British Colonial office and they were recalled, not without first causing a panic among holders of the debentures.

In 1847, the [[Colonial Bank of Issue]] became the only issuer of legal tender. In 1856, however the [[Colonial Bank of Issue]] was disbanded and through the Paper Currency Act 1856, the Union Bank was confirmed once again as an issuer of legal tender. The Act also authorised the [[Oriental Bank]] to issue legal tender but this bank ceased operations in 1861.

Between 1861 and 1874, a number of other banks including the [[Bank of New Zealand]], [[Bank of New South Wales]], [[National Bank of New Zealand]] and [[Colonial Bank of New Zealand]] were created by Acts of Parliament and authorised to issue bank notes backed by gold, however these notes were not legal tender.

The 1893 Bank Note Issue Act allowed the government to declare a bank's right to issue legal tender. This enabled the government to make such a declaration to assist the [[Bank of New Zealand]] when in 1895 the bank encountered financial difficulties that could have led to its failure.

In 1914, the Banking Amendment Act gave legal tender status to bank notes from any issuer and removed the requirement that banks authorised to issue bank notes must redeem them on demand for gold (the [[gold standard]]).

In 1933, the Coinage Act created a specific New Zealand coinage and removed legal tender status from British coins. In the same year the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]] was established. The bank was given a monopoly on the issue of legal tender. The Reserve Bank also provided a mechanism through which the other issuers of legal tender could phase out their bank notes. These banknotes were convertible into British legal tender on demand at the Reserve Bank and remained so until the 1938 Sterling Exchange Suspension Notice that suspended provisions of a 1936 amendment of the 1933 Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act.

In 1964, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act restated that only notes issued by the Reserve Bank were legal tender. The Act also ended the right of individuals to redeem their bank notes for coin, effectively ending the distinction between coin and notes in New Zealand. The Act came into force in 1967 establishing as legal tender all [[New Zealand dollar]] five dollars banknotes and greater, all decimal coins, the pre-decimal sixpence, the [[shilling]], and the [[florin (New Zealand coin)|florin]]. Also passed in 1964 was the Decimal Currency Act, which created the basis for a decimal currency, introduced in 1967.

As of 2005, banknotes were legal tender for all payments, and $1 and $2 coins were legal tender for payments up to $100, and 10c, 20c, and 50c silver coins were legal tender for payments up to $5. These older style silver coins were legal tender until October 2006, after which only the new 10c, 20c and 50c coins, introduced in August 2006, are legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/research/bulletin/2002_2006/2003mar66_1matthews.pdf |title=Reserve Bank of New Zealand: Bulletin Vol. 66 No. 1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=3 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515010654/http://rbnz.govt.nz/research/bulletin/2002_2006/2003mar66_1matthews.pdf |archivedate=15 May 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore and Brunei===
[[Singapore]] and [[Brunei]] have a Currency Interchangeability Agreement since 12 June 1967. Under the agreement, [[Singapore dollar]] and [[Brunei dollar]] are exchangeable at par without charge in both countries. As such, the currency of one country is accepted in the other country as "customary tender".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mas.gov.sg/currency/currency-interchangeability-agreement-with-brunei.aspx |title=Currency Interchangeability Agreement – Brunei Notes and Coins |publisher=[[Monetary Authority of Singapore]] |date= |accessdate=24 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Qr3u1Feb?url=http://www.mas.gov.sg/currency/currency-interchangeability-agreement-with-brunei.aspx |archivedate=6 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth series of Swiss [[bank notes]] from 1976, recalled by the National Bank in 2000, is no longer legal tender, but can be exchanged in banks for current notes until April 2020.

The Swiss franc is also the legal tender of the Principality of [[Liechtenstein]], which is joined to Switzerland in a [[customs union]].

The Swiss franc is also the currency used for administrative and accounting purposes by most of the numerous international organisations that are headquartered in Switzerland.

Legal tender is solely for the guaranteed settlement of debts and does not affect any party's right of refusal of service in any transaction.&lt;ref name="Royal Mint"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalmint.com/aboutus/policies-and-guidelines/legal-tender-guidelines/|title=Legal Tender Guidelines|accessdate=9 March 2009|publisher=Royal Mint|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302223933/http://www.royalmint.com/aboutus/policies-and-guidelines/legal-tender-guidelines|archivedate=2 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, gold coins were legal tender to any amount, but silver coins were not legal tender for sums over 2 pounds nor bronze for sums over 1 [[shilling]]. This provision was retained in revised form at the introduction of [[decimal day|decimal currency]], and the [[decimal day|Coinage Act 1971]] laid down that coins denominated above 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding 10 pounds, non-bronze coins denominated not more than 10 pence became legal tender for payment not exceeding 5 pounds, and bronze coins became legal tender for payment not exceeding 20 pence.

Throughout the [[United Kingdom]], coins valued [[British one pound coin|1 pound]], [[British two pound coin|2 pounds]], and [[British five pound coin|5 pounds]] [[pound Sterling|Sterling]] are legal tender in unlimited amounts. [[twenty pence (British decimal coin)|Twenty pence pieces]] and [[Fifty pence (British decimal coin)|fifty pence pieces]] are legal tender in amounts up to 10 pounds; [[Five pence (British decimal coin)|five pence pieces]] and [[Ten pence (British decimal coin)|ten pence pieces]] are legal tender in amounts up to 5 pounds; and [[Penny (British decimal coin)|pennies]] and [[Two pence (British decimal coin)|two pence coins]] are legal tender in amounts up to 20 pence.&lt;ref name="Royal Mint"/&gt; In accordance with the Coinage Act 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|title=Coinage Act 1971|path=ukpga/1971/24/contents|access-date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[gold sovereign]]s are also legal tender for any amount. Although it is not specifically mentioned on them, the face values of gold coins are 50p; £1; £2; and £5, a mere fraction of their worth as bullion. Five pound coins, although legal tender, are intended as souvenirs and are almost never seen in circulation.

[[Royal Maundy#Maundy coinage|Maundy money]] is legal tender but may not be accepted by retailers and is worth much more than face value due to its rarity value and silver content.

[[Bank of England note issues|Bank of England notes]] are legal tender in [[England and Wales]] and are issued in the denominations of £5, £10, £20 and £50. They can always be redeemed at the Bank of England even if discontinued. Banknotes issued by Scottish and Northern Irish banks are not legal tender anywhere but are widely accepted with agreement between parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes|title=Bank of England Bank Notes|publisher=Bank of England|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102231606/https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes|archivedate=2 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus legal tender in Scotland is limited to coin.

In a 1976 case, [[Miliangos v George Frank Ltd]], the [[House of Lords]] established that the [[Courts of England and Wales|English courts]] could order debts to be paid in currencies other than the pound sterling under certain circumstances, overturning two centuries of precedent.

===United States===
Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861 to 1865), silver coins were legal tender only up to the sum of $5. Before 1853, when U.S. silver coins were reduced in weight 7%, coins had exactly their value in metal (from 1830 to 1852). Two silver 50 cent coins had exactly $1 worth of silver. A gold U.S. dollar of 1849 had $1 worth of gold. With the flood of gold coming out of the California mines in the early 1850s, the price of silver rose (gold went down). Thus, 50 cent coins of 1840 to 1852 were worth 53 cents if melted down. The government could increase the value of the gold coins (expensive) or reduce the size of all U.S. silver coins. With the reduction of 1853, a 50-cent coin now had only 48 cents of silver. This is the reason for the $5 limit of silver coins as legal tender; paying somebody $100 in the new silver coins would be giving them $96 worth of silver. Most people preferred bank check or gold coins for large purchases.

During the early [[American Civil War]], the federal government first issued United States Notes (the first [[greenback (money)|greenback]] notes), which were not redeemable in gold and silver coins but could be used to pay "all dues" to the federal government. Since land purchases and duties on imports were payable only in gold or the new [[Demand Note]]s, the Demand Notes were bought by importers and land speculators for about 97 cents on the gold dollar and never lost value. 1862 greenbacks ([[United States Note|Legal Tender Notes]]) at first traded for 97 cents on the dollar but gained/lost value depending on fortunes of the Union army. The value of Legal Tender Greenbacks swung wildly but trading was from 85 to 33 cents on the gold dollar.

This resulted in a situation in which the greenback "Legal Tender" notes of 1862 were [[fiat money|fiat]], and so gold and silver were held and paper circulated at a discount because of [[Gresham's Law]]. The 1861 Demand Notes were a huge success but robbed the customs house of much needed gold coin (interest on most bonds back then was paid in gold). A money-strapped Congress, which had to pay for the war, eventually adopted the [[Legal Tender Cases#Legal Tender Act of 1862|Legal Tender Act of 1862]], issuing [[United States Notes]] backed only by treasury securities, and compelled the people to accept the new notes at a discount; prices rose except for those who had gold and/or silver coins.

Following the Civil War, paper currency was disputed as to if it must be accepted as payment. In 1869, Hepburn v. Griswold found that Henry Griswold would not have to accept paper currency because it could not truly be "legal tender" and was unconstitutional as a legally enforceable means to pay debts. This led to the Legal Tender Cases in 1870, which overturned the previous ruling and established the paper currency as constitutional and proper legal tender that must be accepted in all situations.&lt;ref&gt;Hammond, Bray. ''Banks and Politics in America''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991. pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

With the 1884 Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Juilliard v. Greenman]]'', the "Supreme Court ruled that Congress had the right to issue notes to be legal tender for the payment of public and private debt. Legal-tender notes are treasury notes or banknotes that, in the eyes of the law, must be accepted in the payment of debts."&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Larry. ''The Encyclopedia of Money''. Santa Barbara: ABC CLIO, 2009. pp. 250–251&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling in the [[Legal Tender Cases]] (which include ''Juilliard v. Greenman'') led later courts to "support the federal government's invalidation of gold clauses in private contracts in the 1930s."&lt;ref&gt;Zywicki, Todd. "Article I, Section 8" in ''The Heritage Guide to the Constitution''. Regnery Publishing, 2014. p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, coins made of gold or silver may not necessarily be legal tender, if they are not fiat money in the jurisdiction where they are proffered as payment. The [[Coinage Act of 1965]] states (in part):

{{quote|United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes and dues. Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts.|{{usc|31|5103}}}}

Contrary to common misconception,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanlewis/2017/04/18/what-is-a-legal-tender-law-and-is-it-a-problem |title=What Is A 'Legal Tender Law'?

Private businesses are free to create their own policies on whether or not they accept cash, unless there is a specific state law which says otherwise. For example, a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in cents or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, convenience stores, and gas stations may refuse to accept large denomination currency as a matter of policy or safety.&lt;ref name=LTSFAQ&gt;

The principal purpose of that statute is to ensure the nationwide acceptance of U.S. currency, consistent with constitutional language that reserves to Congress the power to create a uniform currency that holds the same value throughout the United States. While the statute provides that U.S. money is legal tender that may be accepted for the payment of debts, it does not require ''acceptance'' of cash payments, nor does it provide that restrictions cannot be imposed upon the acceptance of cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Larson |first1=Aaron |title=Is it Legal to Refuse Cash Payment |url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/consumer-protection/it-legal-refuse-cash-payment |website=Expert Law |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venezuela===

On 11 December 2016, the Venezuelan Government announced demonetisation following almost 500% inflation in the country. People of the country were given 3 days to get rid of the 100 Bolivar notes (most widely used currency) post the introduction of new note of higher denominations. As of 15 June 2017, there has been 7 extensions (one per month) of the legal use of the 100 bolivares bill notes. The 100 Bolivar notes are still legal tender up today 30 December 2017.

Энциклопедический словарь-справочник руководителя предприятия. — М.: Книжный мир, 2004. — 1504 с.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[leasehold estate]], the [[landlord]] is the lessor and the tenant is the lessee. The lessor may be the owner of the property or an agent authorized on the owner's behalf. Commercial [[bank]]s, credit non-bank organizations, leasing companies often act as lessors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfin.ru/management/finance/capital/leasing_deal.shtml?printversion&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

A lessor can be both [[legal entity]] and individual.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfin.ru/management/finance/capital/leasing_deal.shtml?printversion&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://taxpravo.ru/novosti/statya-151554-lizingodatel_vprave_primenyat_spetsialnyiy_koeffitsient_no_ne_vyishe_3&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the term “leasing company” sometimes is used as a synonym to the term “lessor”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.credits.ru/glossary/term/175/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923211056/http://www.credits.ru/glossary/term/175/ |archivedate=2015-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Seller of the property and the lessor can be one and the same person.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aup.ru/books/m191/6_1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of lessor==

The process of interaction of the lessor with other participants of the Leasing Contract is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Боровская М.А., Налесная Я.А. БАНКОВСКИЕ УСЛУГИ ПРЕДПРИЯТИЯМ. Учебно-методическое пособие. Таганрог: ТРТУ, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
#The Lessee chooses the seller who possesses the required property
#The lessor acquires this property. He acquires the property not for his own use, but specifically for assignment for temporary use.
#The lessor transfers the property to the Lessee for temporary use for an agreed payment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allpravo.ru/library/doc99p0/instrum3881/item3888.html&lt;/ref&gt;
#On completion the contract, depending on its conditions the property shall be returned to the lessor or passed into the ownership of the Lessee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.garant.ru/consult/account/519026/&lt;/ref&gt;

For the whole time period of the Leasing Contract the property is in the ownership of the lessor.&lt;ref&gt;http://bibliotekar.ru/vneshneeconomicheskaya-deyatelnost-2/231.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Боровская М.А., Налесная Я.А. БАНКОВСКИЕ УСЛУГИ ПРЕДПРИЯТИЯМ. Учебно-методическое пособие. Таганрог: ТРТУ, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfin.ru/management/finance/capital/leasing_deal.shtml?printversion&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In case of failure of reimbursements of lease payments under the schedule specified in the contract the lessor has the right to exempt the property from the Lessee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfin.ru/management/finance/capital/leasing_deal.shtml?printversion&lt;/ref&gt; In case of bankruptcy of the Lessee the lessor has the priority right for payments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfin.ru/management/finance/capital/leasing_deal.shtml?printversion&lt;/ref&gt;

If the lessor contrary to the contract has interfered with the choice of the seller or leasing subject, he bears the responsibility for non-delivery of the equipment, personal injury of citizens while using the leasing subject, damage which is caused to the property of the Lessee and the third Parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pravorggu.ru/2007_10/nseleznev_21.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140227163837/http://pravorggu.ru/2007_10/nseleznev_21.shtml |archivedate=2014-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are however exceptions from this norm.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buh.ru/document-2056&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of implementation of a high-priced project the lessor may involve into the transaction additional sources of financial assets (through banks, [[insurance company|insurance companies]], [[investment fund]]s, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Боровская М.А., Налесная Я.А.

==Official leasing operator==

Official leasing provider (dealer) is a special type of lessor. This is the official supplier of specialized machinery, transport and equipment directly to the final consumer or through a leasing company. Official leasing operator cooperates with manufacturers (subsidiary offices) of prime machinery under the operator (dealer) agreement.

For the leasing company the official leasing operator acts as:
* official certified supplier;
* agent (provides leasing consumers – clients); 
* insurance agent and liquidator (liquidation of machinery which is free from the financial lease).

For consumers, the official leasing operator acts as:      
* official certified supplier;     
* leasing [[broker]] (selects a leasing company, which is the most relevant to the requirements of the client, based on the needs and capabilities of the client);
* advisor on optimization of vehicle park for completing of customer's project;
* advisor on improvement of the effectiveness of the company’s processes associated with the use of machinery.

==Legislation==

Rights and obligations of the lessor in the [[Russian Federation]] are regulated by the contract, under the Federal Law “On financial rent (leasing)”,&lt;ref&gt;http://base.garant.ru/12113492/2/&lt;/ref&gt; the Tax Code of the Russian Federation,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pmp.admoblkaluga.ru/content/news/federal/events/m,29,14613/&lt;/ref&gt; the Civil Code, and others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pravorggu.ru/2007_10/nseleznev_21.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140227163837/http://pravorggu.ru/2007_10/nseleznev_21.shtml |archivedate=2014-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ukraine]] – by the Law “On Financial Leasing” and many others,&lt;ref&gt;http://jurliga.ligazakon.ua/news/2010/3/23/21722.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Uzbekistan]] – by Chapter 34 of the Civil Code of Uzbekistan and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://fmc.uz/legisl.php?id=k_grajd_34_6&lt;/ref&gt; International leasing contracts are regulated under the UNIDROIT Convention on International Financial Leasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://platezhnye-karty.com/lizingodatel-nerezident-nado-li-platit-dvojnoj-nds/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228211010/http://platezhnye-karty.com/lizingodatel-nerezident-nado-li-platit-dvojnoj-nds/ |archivedate=2014-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Aspects}}
'''Libertarian theories of law''' build upon [[Classical liberalism|classical liberal]] and [[Individualism|individualist]] doctrines.

The defining characteristics of libertarian legal theory are its insistence that the amount of governmental intervention should be kept to a minimum and the primary functions of law should be enforcement of contracts and social order, though "social order" is often seen as a desirable side effect of a [[free market]] rather than a philosophical necessity.

Historically, the Austrian economist [[Friedrich Hayek]] is the most important libertarian legal theorist.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Another important predecessor was [[Lysander Spooner]], a 19th-century American [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]] and lawyer. [[John Locke]] was also an influence on libertarian legal theory (see ''[[Two Treatises of Government]])''.

Ideas range from [[anarcho-capitalism]] to a [[Minarchism|minimal state]] providing physical protection and enforcement of contracts. Some advocate regulation, including the existence of a police force, military, public land, and public infrastructure. [[Geolibertarianism|Geolibertarians]] oppose absolute ownership of land on [[Georgism|Georgist]] grounds.

The '''Limitation Act 1939''' (2 &amp; 3 Geo.6 c.21) was an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that simplified the law relating to [[Statute of limitations|limitation periods]] in England &amp; Wales. The Act was based on the fifth report of the [[Law Commission (England and Wales)|Law Revision Committee]] and is divided into 3 parts, with Part I dealing with limitation periods, Part II dealing with exceptions and Part III dealing with general matters.&lt;ref&gt;Unger (1940) p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 2 of Part I introduces a new limitation period; six years for all cases in [[English tort law|tort]] and [[English contract law|contract]]. The period runs from the point where the injury or problem was created, not from when it was discovered; thus, the Act replicates problems later solved by the [[Limitation Act 1963]]. Part II allows for a "resetting" of the limitation period in situations where the party is insane, not a legal adult or imprisoned for either the death penalty or for penal servitude.&lt;ref&gt;Unger (1940) p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8658">The '''Malian Family Code''' ({{lang-fr|'''Code de Famille'''}}) is the [[family law]] in [[Mali]], passed in 1962.&lt;ref name="allafrica"/&gt; 

In 2009, an amendment was proposed (which has not yet been enacted) as widespread protests forced the president to send the bill back to parliament for review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201010061024.html |publisher=AllAfrica.com |title= Mali: Parliament Continues Family Law Debate |date=6 October 2010 |accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill sought to increase [[women's rights]] in the country, but was still opposed by some women. The bill was condemned by most religious scholars. It was passed in 2009, but withdrawn later the same year.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8223736.stm |publisher=[[BBC]] |title=Mali women's rights bill blocked |accessdate=25 November 2010 |last=Vogl |first=Martin|date=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law== 
{{expand section|date=November 2010}}   
In 1962, Mali passed its first Family Code.&lt;ref name="allafrica"/&gt; 

==Proposed amendment==
The proposed amendment would have recognised only civil marriages, while defining marriage as a secular institution, thus entitling a divorcee to a share of inheritance. Women would have also been allowed greater inheritance rights than what was stipulated by [[Shariah law]], as they would not be required to obey their husbands.&lt;ref name="lawblock"/&gt; The "paternal power" would be replaced with "parental authority," and also said "no marriage can be renounced." Furthermore, the bill raised the legal age for marriage to 18 and allowed divorce if a couple had lived apart for at least three years. A child born outside of marriage would also be entitled to a share of any inheritance.&lt;ref name="orange"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orange.ug/news/?p=26613 |title=Mali Parliament Asked To Review Law On Women’s Rights |author=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |accessdate=25 November 2010 |publisher=orange.ug}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Amadou Toumani Touré|Toumani Touré]] supported the bill, which was seen as a move toward [[secularism]]. The law was initially adopted by the [[National Assembly of Mali|National Assembly]] on August 3, 2009.&lt;ref name="ngo"/&gt;

===Advocacy===
During the ''NGO Forum of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights'' in [[Banjul]], an African women's rights groups called for the adoption of the bill, saying it "provides some crucial guarantees for Malian women's universal rights, [and] would constitute a fundamental first step towards bringing Malian laws into compliance with international and regional standards." The group cited Mali's ratification of the [[United Nations]] [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] in 1985, the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa in 2005, and the UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] in 1990. It further said: "We are thus deeply concerned that the enactment of this legislation...is in suspense. Violations of Malian women's human rights are favored by this legislative gap. We stress the urgent need to adopt such a code...by ensuring that the second reading takes place without further delay and that the Family Code is enacted in its present form, without weakening of any of its provisions."&lt;ref name="ngo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.africa4womensrights.org/post/2010/06/15/Mali%3A-Call-for-urgent-adoption-of-the-new-Family-Code-without-weakening-any-of-its-provisions |title=Mali: Call for urgent adoption of the new Family Code without weakening of its provisions |date=15 June 2010 |accessdate=25 November 2010 |publisher=Africa for Women's Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
Mamadou Diamouténé, the head of a task group from the council, said that without the recommended changes, the bill would be "open road to debauchery. It is not that anyone can go wherever she wishes without her husband’s approval, because we cannot forget that the man is the head of the family."&lt;ref name="amendments"/&gt;

Muslim leaders and other youth groups vowed to block the law and even threatened a campaign of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=85676 |publisher=IRIN News |title=Mali: Threats of violence greet new family code |date=11 August 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Threats against legislators, angry sermons, organised protest meetings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2010|url=http://www.camsao.com/news/breaking-news/mali-radicals-block-new-family-law |title=Mali: Radicals Block New Family Law |publisher=Camsao |accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and radio and television campaigns all attempted to rally opposition to the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.camsao.com/news/breaking-news/mali-muslim-conservatives-blocking-new-family-law |date=2010|title=Mali: Muslim Conservatives Blocking New Family Law |publisher=Camsao}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslim leaders went so far as to call the law the work of the devil and against [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Tens of thousands marched in the streets to protest the law.&lt;ref name="lawblock"/&gt; In one such demonstration, 50,000 people rallied amidst calls that the bill was "an insult to the Koran."&lt;ref name="orange"/&gt;

Some women's groups were also opposed to the law. The president of the National Union of Muslim Women said that "only a tiny minority of woman here who want this new law. The poor and illiterate women of this country, the real Muslims, are against it".&lt;ref name="lawblock"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

One [[imam]] who spoke in support of the code went into hiding.&lt;ref name="aljaz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/witness/2010/09/201095141841631119.html |title=The Family Code (video)|date=12 November 2010 |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions===
President Touré reasserted that the struggle to pursue "the dual objective of promoting a wave of modernization while preserving the foundations of our society" would continue. He also said that failures to update and enforce the law "proves that societal change is not ordered by decree. [The] door of debate is still open."

[[Mountaga Tall]], an MP, said: "We demonstrated intellectual laziness in adopting the last code so quickly. This time, the assembly will start from zero."&lt;ref name="allafrica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200909010808.html |publisher=AllAfrica.com |title= Mali: Back to the Drawing Board for New Family Code |date=1 September 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Further amendments====
As a result of public outcry, President Touré sent the bill back to parliament on August 27, 2009.&lt;ref name="allafrica"/&gt; "I have taken this decision to send the family code for a second reading to ensure calm and a peaceful society, and to obtain the support and understanding of our fellow citizens."&lt;ref name="lawblock"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?c=Article_C&amp;pagename=Zone-English-News/NWELayout&amp;cid=1251021233325 |title=Muslim Protests Block Mali Family Code |publisher=Islam Online |date=27 August 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An amended version, endorsed by the [[High Islamic Council]], the highest authority on Islam in the country, was tabled.&lt;ref name="aljaz"/&gt; This new bill included the reintroduction of religious marriage, altered the previous version's enhancement of women's [[inheritance]] rights, and changed the recognition of an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate child]].&lt;ref name="newbill"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english.rfi.fr/africa/20101006-malis-parliament-continues-family-law-debate |title=Mali's parliament continues family law debate |publisher=RFI |date=6 October 2010 |accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other amendments being proposed, despite being blocked in the initial version, include:
*A husband and wife can keep separate homes only if the husband approves;
*A divorcée may keep her ex-husband’s name if he agrees;
*A girl would be allowed to get married at 15.&lt;ref name="amendments"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsite.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportID=88251 |publisher=IRIN News |title=Mali: 'Reality check' needed in proposed changes to family code |date=26 February 2010 |accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However these three proposals have not been made a part of law, whereas religious marriage is still going to be maintained 

The debate over the bill  included "[[civil society]]" groups in the first phase, and religious groups in the amendment phase.&lt;ref name="newbill"/&gt;

The [http://www.tax.mpg.de/en/pub/home.cfm Max Planck Institute for Tax Law and Public Finance] is an interdisciplinary research center in [[Munich]]. The Institute is part of the [[Max Planck Society]], Germany’s foremost provider of basic research in science and humanities, funded largely from public resources.

== History ==
The Senate of the [[Max Planck Society]] has founded the '''Max Planck Institute for Tax Law and Public Finance''' in Munich as of 
1 January 2011. It consists of the [http://www.tax.mpg.de/en/pub/public_economics.cfm Department of Public Economics], headed by [[Kai A. Konrad]], and the [http://www.tax.mpg.de/en/pub/business_and_tax_law.cfm Department of Business and Tax Law], headed by Wolfgang Schön.

The Institute was founded by spinning-off the tax departments of the former [[Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property, Competition and Tax Law]], which was located at the same place. Together with the [[Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law]] and the [[Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Social Law]], the Institute founded the Munich Max Planck Campus for Legal and Economic Research.

About 50 lawyers and economists, from Germany and abroad, work at the Institute. They do basic research on taxation but also in associated fields of research. The Institute’s work breeds scientific journals, articles and monographs, the Institute is involved in academic conferences, lectures and cooperation with other academic institutions and it also publishes comments on matters of fiscal policy and advises legislatures on the national as well as on the international level. The Institute’s mission is not limited to producing internationally visible research output in the respective disciplines but it also encompasses the advancement of interdisciplinary exchange. The Institute hosts visiting scholars and visiting researchers from all over the world and supports the research of PhD-students and post-docs by granting generous scholarships.

During [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] created [[Military occupation|military-led regimes]] in occupied territories which were known as a '''Military administration''' or '''Military administration authority''' ([[German language|de:]] ''Militärverwaltung''). These differed from ''[[Reichskommissariat]]e'' which were led by [[Nazi Party]] officials. A ''Military administration'' was normally led by a "[[Commander|military commander]]" (''Militärbefehlshaber'', official acronym ''MilBfh.'').

==Ranks==
{{See also|Corps colours of the German Army (1935–1945)#Corps colours of the Heeresverwaltung}}

Officials of the ''Military administration'', regardless serving in the Wehrmacht, war economy, military education facilities, or in the [[Military occupation|military-led regimes]] in occupied territories, etc., wore military rank insignias similar to these of the Wehrmacht, characterised by the main [[Waffenfarbe|corps colour]] &lt;small&gt;(de: Hauptfarbe)&lt;/small&gt; dark-green, and various secondary colours &lt;small&gt;(de: Nebenfarben)&lt;/small&gt; as well.

The ranks and rank insignias of the ''Military administration'' were as follows.

The '''Selective Service Act of 1948''', also known as the '''Elston Act''', was a major revision of the [[Articles of War of the United States]] enacted June 24, 1948 that established the current implementation of the [[Selective Service System]].

==History==
The previous iteration of the Selective Service System was established by the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940]]. After two extensions, the Selective Training and Service Act was allowed to expire on March 31, 1947. In 1948, it was replaced by a new and distinct Selective Service System established by this Act. The Selective Service Act of 1948 was originally intended to remain in effect for two years (i.e., until June 24, 1950), but was extended multiple times, usually immediately before its two-year period of effectiveness was due to expire.

The '''Mine Safety and Health Administration''' ('''MSHA''') ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|m|ʃ|ə}}) is an agency of the [[United States Department of Labor]] which administers the provisions of the [[Federal Mine Safety and Health Act]] of 1977 (Mine Act) to enforce compliance with mandatory [[Occupational safety and health|safety and health]] standards as a means to eliminate fatal [[Mining accident|accidents]], to reduce the frequency and severity of nonfatal accidents, to minimize health hazards, and to promote improved safety and health conditions in the nation's mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) |location=Washington, DC |url=http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/MISSION.HTM |title=MSHA's Mission |accessdate= 2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSHA carries out the mandates of the Mine Act at all [[mining]] and [[mineral processing]] operations in the United States, regardless of size, number of employees, commodity mined, or method of extraction. [[David Zatezalo]] is Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health, and the head of MSHA.

MSHA is organized into several divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msha.gov/programs/programs.htm |title=MSHA Program Areas |publisher=msha.gov |accessdate= 2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coal Mine Safety and Health division is divided into 12 districts covering [[coal mining]] in different portions of the United States. The Metal-Nonmetal Mine Safety and Health division covers six regions of the United States.

== History ==

=== Early legislation ===
In 1891, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the first federal statute governing mine safety. The 1891 law was relatively modest legislation that applied only to mines in [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]], and, among other things, established minimum [[Underground mine ventilation|ventilation]] requirements at underground coal mines and prohibited operators from employing children under 12 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Mine Safety and Health Administration. {{cite web |url=http://www.msha.gov/mshainfo/mshainf2.htm | title=History of Mine Safety and Health Legislation |accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, Congress established the [[United States Bureau of Mines|Bureau of Mines]] as a new agency in the [[Department of the Interior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Page |first=Arthur W. |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=March 1912  |title=Safety First Underground: The New Bureau Of Mines And Its Life Saving Campaign In The Coal Fields |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=XXIII |issue= |pages=549–563 |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Vv--PfedzLAC&amp;pg=PA549|accessdate=2009-07-10 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau was charged with the responsibility to conduct research and to reduce accidents in the coal mining industry, but was given no inspection authority until 1941, when Congress empowered federal inspectors to enter mines.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 77-49, 55 Stat. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, Congress authorized the formulation of the first [[code of federal regulations]] for mine safety.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 80-328, 61 Stat. 725.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Coal Mine Safety Act of 1952]] provided for annual inspections in certain underground coal mines, and gave the Bureau limited enforcement authority, including power to issue violation notices and imminent danger withdrawal orders.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 82-552, 66 Stat. 692, July 16, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1952 Act also authorized the assessment of [[Civil penalty|civil penalties]] against mine operators for noncompliance with withdrawal orders or for refusing to give inspectors access to mine property, although no provision was made for monetary penalties for noncompliance with the safety provisions. In 1966, Congress extended coverage of the 1952 Coal Act to all underground coal mines.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 89-376, Mar. 26, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first federal statute directly regulating non-coal mines did not appear until the passage of the Federal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety Act of 1966.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 89-577, Sept. 16, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1966 Act provided for the promulgation of standards, many of which were advisory, and for inspections and investigations; however, its enforcement authority was minimal.

=== Coal Act ===
The [[Coal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1969]], generally referred to as the Coal Act, was more comprehensive and more stringent than any previous federal legislation governing the mining industry.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 91-173, Dec. 30, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; The Coal Act included [[Surface mining|surface]] as well as underground coal mines within its scope, required two annual inspections of every surface coal mine and four at every underground coal mine, and dramatically increased federal enforcement powers in coal mines. The Coal Act also required monetary penalties for all violations, and established criminal penalties for knowing and willful violations. The safety standards for all coal mines were strengthened, and health standards were adopted. The Coal Act included specific procedures for the development of improved mandatory [[Occupational safety and health|health and safety]] standards, and provided compensation for miners who were totally and permanently disabled by the progressive respiratory disease caused by the inhalation of fine [[coal dust]] [[pneumoconiosis]] or "black lung."

In 1973, the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], through administrative action, created the [[Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration]] (MESA) as a new departmental agency separate from the Bureau of Mines. MESA assumed the safety and health enforcement functions formerly carried out by the Bureau to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest between the enforcement of mine safety and health standards and the Bureau's responsibilities for mineral resource development. (MESA was the predecessor organization to MSHA, prior to March 9, 1978.)

=== Mine Act and creation of MSHA ===
More recently, Congress passed the [[Federal Mine Safety and Health Act]] of 1977, the legislation which currently governs MSHA's activities.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 95-164, Nov. 9, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mine Act amended the 1969 Coal Act in a number of significant ways, and consolidated all federal health and safety regulations of the mining industry, coal as well as non-coal mining, under a single statutory scheme. The Mine Act strengthened and expanded the rights of miners, and enhanced the protection of miners from retaliation for exercising such rights. Mining fatalities dropped sharply under the Mine Act from 272 in 1977 to 45 in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Mine Fatalities – 100 Years of Progress (1915-2015)|url = http://www.minesafetycenter.com/mine-fatalities-progress/|website = Mine Safety Center MSHA Blog|accessdate = 15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mine Act also transferred responsibility for carrying out its mandates from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Labor, and created MSHA. Additionally, the Mine Act established the independent [[Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission]] to provide for independent review of the majority of MSHA's enforcement actions.

Congress passed the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act (MINER Act) in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 109-236, 120 Stat. 493, June 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The MINER Act amended the Mine Act to require mine-specific emergency response plans in underground coal mines; added new regulations regarding mine rescue teams and sealing of abandoned areas; required prompt notification of mine accidents; and enhanced civil penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/MSHAINF2.HTM |title=History of Mine Safety and Health Legislation |publisher=Msha.gov |accessdate= 2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msha.gov/MinerAct/MinerActSingleSource.asp |title=The MINER Act: Single Source Page |publisher=Msha.gov |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern regulations ==
Modern mining regulation in the [[United States]] is carried out by MSHA and governed by The [[Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977]] and [http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/ppm/pmvol3b.htm MSHA's Program Policy Manual Volume III].  

On January 27, 2012 as required under the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] adopted final rules which require covered SEC-reporting issuers that are “operator(s)” (or that has a subsidiary that is an “operator”) of a “coal or other mine” to disclose certain mine safety violations, citations and orders and related matters for each coal or other mine that they operate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SEC Adopts Mine Safety Disclosure Rules |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/sec-adopts-mine-safety-disclosure-rules |publisher= Andrews Kurth LLP|work=The [[National Law Review]]|date=2012-01-11|accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Covered mine “operator(s)” are also required to file a current report on Form 8-K to disclose the receipt of certain orders and notices from the U.S. Labor Department’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) related to a coal or other mine that they operate.{{Relevance-inline|date=March 2012}}

=== Hearing Conservation ===
MSHA regulations state an action level (AL) and a permissible exposure level (PEL) which set standards for when a hearing conservation program need to be put into place. The action level is an 8-hour time-weighted average sound level (TWA&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) of 85 dBA, or  a dose of 50%, integrating all sound levels from 80 dBA to at least 130 dBA. A permissible exposure level (PEL) is a TWA&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; of 90 dBA, or equivalently, a dose of 100% , integrating all sound levels from 90 dBA to at least 140 dBA. In the hearing conservation program the company must try all feasible engineering and administrative controls before they provide hearing protective devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Royster|first=Larry H.|title=Appendix I: Department Of Labor Occupational Noise Exposure Standard|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3320/978-1-931504-14-0.a1|work=Noise Vibration Problem-Solution Workbook|pages=A1–A8|publisher=American Industrial Hygiene Association|isbn=9781931504140|access-date=2018-12-02|last2=Royster|first2=Julia Doswell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a miner's noise exposure exceeds the PEL despite the use of all feasible engineering and administrative controls, Section 62.130 requires the company to:

·        continue to use the controls to maintain the miner's exposure as low as feasible;

·        provide and require the use of hearing protectors;

·        enroll the miner in a hearing conservation program; and

·        post procedures for administrative controls on the mine bulletin board and provide a copy to the affected miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arlweb.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm|title=MSHA - Noise Regulations - Compliance Guide to MSHA's Occupational Noise Exposure Standard - Appendix B|website=arlweb.msha.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although hearing protectors must be provided and used if the engineering and administrative controls fail to reduce the miner's noise exposure to the PEL, they are not accepted in lieu of such controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arlweb.msha.gov/regs/30cfr/|title=Title 30 Code of Federal Regulations|website=arlweb.msha.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in regards to hearing protectors OSHA requires the company to provide hearing protectors to any miner whose noise exposure equals or exceeds the action level. The miner must also be trained on the "types of hearing protectors, the value of wearing hearing protection and of audiometric tests"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arlweb.msha.gov/regs/30cfr/|title=Title 30 Code of Federal Regulations|website=arlweb.msha.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The company must also provide the miner a choice of hearing protectors, including at least two muff type and two plug type hearing protectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arlweb.msha.gov/regs/30cfr/|title=Title 30 Code of Federal Regulations|website=arlweb.msha.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hearing protectors that you provide must be "in good condition, fitted, and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arlweb.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/guide303.htm|title=MSHA - Noise Regulations - Compliance Guide to MSHA's Occupational Noise Exposure Standard - Main Document|website=arlweb.msha.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. If a miner's noise exposure exceeds the dual hearing protector level, the company must provide both a muff type and plug type protector&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://arlweb.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/guide303.htm|title=MSHA - Noise Regulations - Compliance Guide to MSHA's Occupational Noise Exposure Standard - Main Document|website=arlweb.msha.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Accidents and Accident Reporting ===

Mine operators are required by law to report all mining accidents within 15 minutes of when the operator knew or should have known about the accident. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.msha.gov/about/contact/emergencies&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately reportable accidents and injuries are:
# A death of an individual at a mine;
# An injury to an individual at a mine which has a reasonable potential to cause death;
# An entrapment of an individual for more than thirty minutes;
# An unplanned inundation of a mine by a liquid or gas;
# An unplanned ignition or explosion of gas or dust;
# An unplanned [[mine fire]] not extinguished within 30 minutes of discovery;
# An unplanned ignition or explosion of a [[Explosive material|blasting agent or explosive]];
# An unplanned [[Cave-in|roof fall]] at or above the anchorage zone in active workings where roof bolts are in use; or, an unplanned roof or rib fall in active workings that impairs ventilation or impedes passage;
# A [[Outburst (mining)|coal]] or [[rock outburst]] that causes withdrawal of miners or which disrupts regular mining activity for more than one hour;
# An unstable condition at an [[Coal slurry|impoundment]], [[Waste|refuse]] pile, or [[Spoil tip|culm bank]] which requires emergency action in order to prevent failure, or which causes individuals to evacuate an area; or, failure of an impoundment, refuse pile or [[culm bank]];
# Damage to [[Hoist (mining)|hoisting equipment]] in a shaft or slope which endangers an individual or which interferes with use of the equipment for more than thirty minutes; and
# An event at a mine which causes death or bodily injury to an individual not at the mine at the time the event occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msha.gov/codeaphone/ReportableInjury.asp |title=Immediately Reportable Accidents and Injuries |publisher=Msha.gov |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistical analyses performed by MSHA show that between 1990 and 2004, the industry cut the rate of injuries (a measure comparing the rate of incidents to overall number of employees or hours worked) by more than half and fatalities by two-thirds following three prior decades of steady improvement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_cfJCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=between%201990%20and%202004%2C%20the%20industry%20cut%20the%20rate%20of%20injuries&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Us Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Administration Handbook]: Strategic Information and Regulations (World Business and Investment Library) &lt;/ref&gt;

=== MSHA Inspections ===

MSHA employs nearly one safety inspector for every four coal mines. Underground coal mines are thoroughly inspected at least four times annually by MSHA inspectors. In addition, miners can report violations, and request additional inspections. Miners with such concerns for their work safety cannot be penalized with any threat to the loss of employment.

Additionally, the Mine Safety and Health Act authorizes the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), part of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] under the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] to develop recommendations for mine health standards for the Mine Safety and Health Administration; administer a medical surveillance program for miners, including [[Chest radiograph|chest X-rays]] to detect [[pneumoconiosis]] (black lung disease) in coal miners; conduct on-site investigations in mines; and test and certify [[personal protective equipment]] and hazard-measurement instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/about.html|title=About NIOSH|accessdate=2007-10-28|publisher=United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025061315/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/about.html|archive-date=2007-10-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minimum wage legislation emerged at the [[Gilded Age|end of the nineteenth century]] from the desire to end [[Sweatshop#History|sweated labor]] which had developed in the [[Second Industrial Revolution|wake of industrialization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/4055|title=Minimum Wage Legislation in Various Countries: Bulletin of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, No. 467|last=Broda|first=Rudolf|last2=United States.

The first successful attempts at using minimum wage laws to ameliorate the problem of nonliving wages occurred in the [[Victoria (Australia)|Australian state of Victoria]] in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webb|first=Sidney|date=1912|title=The Economic Theory of a Legal Minimum Wage|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=20|issue=10|pages=973|via=|doi=10.1086/252125|jstor=1820545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gzurqlZpyfcC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=the+history+of+%22minimum+wage%22+law#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20history%20of%20%22minimum%20wage%22%20law&amp;f=false|title=Minimum wage fixing : an international review of practices and problems|last=Starr|first=Gerald|publisher=International Labour Office|year=1993|isbn=9789221025115|edition=2nd impression (with corrections)|location=Geneva|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factory inspector reports and newspaper reporting on the conditions of sweated labor in [[Melbourne]], Victoria led in 1895 to the formation of the [[National Anti-Sweating League]] which pushed the government aggressively to deal legislatively with the problem of substandard wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammond|first=Matthew B.|date=1913|title=The Minimum Wage in Great Britain and Australia|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=48|pages=27|via=|jstor=1012009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government, following the recommendation of the Victorian [[Chief Secretary (British Empire)|Chief Secretary]] [[Alexander Peacock]], established wage boards which were tasked with establishing minimum wages in the labor trades which suffered from nonlivable wages. During the same time period, campaigns against sweated labor were occurring in the United States and England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/4055|title=Minimum Wage Legislation in Various Countries: Bulletin of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, No. 467|last=Broda|first=Rudolf|last2=United States.

=== Progressive Era ===
In the United States in 1890, a group of concerned female reformers who wanted to improve the harsh conditions of sweated workers formed the Consumer's League of the City of New York. The consumer group sought to improve working conditions by boycotting products which were made under sweated conditions and did not conform to a code of "fair house" standards drawn up by them. Similar, consumer leagues formed throughout the United States, and in 1899, they united under the [[National Consumers League|National Consumer League]] (NCL) parent organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42072067|title=The politics of the minimum wage|last=Jerold L.,|first=Waltman|date=2000|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=|isbn=9780252025457|location=Urbana|pages=11|oclc=42072067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer advocacy, however, was extremely slow at changing conditions in the sweated industries. When NCL leaders in 1908 went to an international [[anti-sweatshop movement|anti-sweatshop]] conference in [[Geneva]], Switzerland and were introduced to [[Australian labour movement|Australian minimum wage legislation]], which had successfully dealt with sweated labor, they came home believers and made minimum wage legislation part of their national platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Bound by Our Constitution : Women, Workers, and the Minimum Wage|last=Vivien|first=Hart|date=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=|isbn=9781400821563|location=Princeton|pages=63|oclc=700688619}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:1912 Lawrence Textile Strike 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Massachusetts militiamen with fixed bayonets surround a group of peaceful strikers during the [[Lawrence textile strike]] which proved pivotal in the passage of the first U.S. minimum wage legislation (1912)]]
In 1910, in conjunction with advocacy work led by [[Florence Kelley]] of the National Consumer League, the [[Women's Trade Union League]] (WTLU) of Massachusetts under the leadership of Elizabeth Evans took up the cause of minimum wage legislation in [[Massachusetts]]. Over the next two years, a coalition of social reform groups and labor advocates in Boston pushed for minimum wage legislation in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Bound by Our Constitution : Women, Workers, and the Minimum Wage|last=Vivien|first=Hart|date=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=|isbn=9781400821563|location=Princeton|pages=68|oclc=700688619}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, 1912, Massachusetts passed the first minimum wage legislation in the United States, which established a state commission for recommending non-compulsory minimum wages for women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kelley|first=Florence|date=1912|title=Minimum-Wage Laws|jstor=1820546|journal=Journal of Political Economy|volume=20|issue=10|pages=999–1010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/actsResolves/1912/1912acts0706.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The passage of the bill was significantly assisted by the [[1912 Lawrence textile strike|Lawrence textile strike]] which had raged for ten weeks at the beginning of 1912. The strike brought national attention to the plight of the low wage textile workers, and pushed the state legislatures, who feared the magnitude of the strike, to enact progressive labor legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Bound by Our Constitution : Women, Workers, and the Minimum Wage|last=Vivien|first=Hart|date=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=|isbn=9781400821563|location=Princeton|pages=70–71|oclc=700688619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1923, fifteen [[U.S. state]]s and the [[District of Columbia]] had passed [[minimum wage law]]s, with pressure being placed on state legislatures by the National Consumers League in a coalition with other women's voluntary associations and organized labor.&lt;ref name="quigley"&gt;William P. Quigley, "'A Fair Day's Pay For A Fair Day's Work': Time to Raise and Index the Minimum Wage", 27 ''St. Mary's L.

Advocates for state minimum wage laws hoped that they would be upheld under the precedent of ''[[Muller v. Oregon]]'' (1908), which upheld maximum working hours laws for women on the grounds that women required special protection that men did not.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Supreme Court, however, did not extend this principle to minimum wage laws.&lt;ref name="quigley" /&gt;{{rp|518}} The court ruled in ''[[Adkins v. Children's Hospital]]'' (1923) that the District of Columbia's minimum wage law was unconstitutional, because the law interfered with the ability of employers to [[Freedom of contract|freely negotiate wage contracts]] with employees. The court also noted that women did not require anymore special protection by the law, following the passage in 1920 of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]], which gave women the right to vote and equal legal status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25409018|title=Protecting soldiers and mothers : the political origins of social policy in the United States|last=Theda|first=Skocpol|date=1992|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=0674717651|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=423|oclc=25409018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Deal ===
In 1933, the [[Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt administration]] during the [[New Deal]] made the first attempt at establishing a national minimum wage regiment with the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]], which set minimum wage and maximum hours on an industry and regional basis. The Supreme Court, however, in ''[[Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States]]'' (1935) ruled the act unconstitutional, and the minimum wage regulations were abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DF_lCgAAQBAJ|title=The Minimum Wage: A Reference Handbook|last=Levin-Waldman|first=Oren M.|date=2015-12-01|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=9781440833953|location=|pages=12–13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later after President Roosevelt's overwhelming [[Presidential election of 1936|reelection in 1936]] and [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|discussion of judicial reform]], the Supreme Court took up the issue of labor legislation again in ''[[West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish]]'' (1937) and upheld the constitutionality of minimum wage legislation enacted by [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state and overturned the ''Adkins'' decision which marked the end of the ''Lochner'' era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mQBkiNPupvsC|title=The Case for the Living Wage|last=Waltman|first=Jerold L.|date=2004|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=|isbn=9780875863023|location=|pages=184|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, the minimum wage was re-established pursuant to the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]], this time at a uniform rate of $0.25 per hour ($4.78 in 2017 dollars&lt;ref name="calc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm|title=CPI Inflation Calculator|last=|first=|date=|work=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The Supreme Court upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act in ''[[United States v. Darby Lumber Co.]]'' (1941), holding that Congress had the power under the [[Commerce Clause]] to regulate employment conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source |case=''U.S. v.

The 1938 minimum wage law only applied to "employees engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce," but in amendments in 1961 and 1966, the federal minimum wage was extended (with slightly different rates) to employees in large retail and service enterprises, local transportation and construction, state and local government employees, as well as other smaller expansions; a grandfather clause in 1990 drew most employees into the purview of federal minimum wage policy, which now set the wage at $3.80.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm#fn2|title=Minimum Wage – Wage and Hour Division (WHD) – U.S. Department of Labor|website=Dol.gov|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal minimum wage in the United States was reset to its current rate of $7.25 per hour in July 2009.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Some U.S. territories (such as [[American Samoa]]) are exempt. Some types of labor are also exempt: Employers may pay [[tip (gratuity)|tipped labor]] a minimum of $2.13 per hour, as long as the hour wage plus tip income equals at least the minimum wage. Persons under the age of 20 may be paid $4.25 an hour for the first 90 calendar days of employment (sometimes known as a youth, teen, or training wage) unless a higher state minimum exists.&lt;ref name="YouthWage"&gt;{{cite web | title = Fact Sheet #32: Youth Minimum Wage – Fair Labor Standards Act | publisher = U.S. Department of Labor – Wage and Hour Division | url = http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs32.pdf | accessdate = 2013-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 increase was the last of three steps of the [[Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007]], which was signed into law as a [[Rider (legislation)|rider]] to the [[U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007]], a bill that also contained almost $5 billion in tax cuts for small businesses.

=== Inflation indexing ===
Some politicians in the United States advocate linking the minimum wage to the [[consumer price index]], thereby increasing the wage automatically each year based on increases to the consumer price index. Linking the minimum wage to the consumer price index avoids the erosion of the [[purchasing power]] of the minimum wage with time because of [[inflation]]. In 1998 [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state became the first state to approve consumer price indexing for its minimum wage.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.epi.org/publication/webfeatures_snapshots_20051221/|title=Indexing the minimum wage for inflation|work=Economic Policy Institute|access-date=2018-03-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] were the first cities to approve consumer price indexing for their minimum wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sfgov.org/olse/san-francisco-historical-minimum-wage-rates|title=San Francisco Historical Minimum Wage Rates {{!}} Office of Labor Standards Enforcement|website=sfgov.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.epi.org/minimum-wage-tracker/#/min_wage/New%20Mexico/Santa%20Fe%20City|title=Minimum Wage Tracker|work=Economic Policy Institute|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; [[Oregon]] and [[Florida]] were the next states to link their minimum wages to the consumer price index.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; Later in 2006, voters in six states ([[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[Missouri]], [[Montana]], [[Nevada]], and [[Ohio]])  approved statewide increases in the state minimum wage. The amounts of these increases ranged from $1 to $1.70 per hour, and all increases were designed to annually index to inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views06/1111-24.htm|title=ACORN and Unions Increase Working Wages Across the Country|last=|first=|date=2006-11-11|work=|publisher=Common Dreams|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618163414/http://www.commondreams.org/views06/1111-24.htm|archivedate=2013-06-18|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the minimum wage is indexed to inflation in 17 states.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;

Since 2012, a growing protest and advocacy movement called "[[Fight for $15]]", initially growing out of [[fast food worker strikes]], has advocated for an increase in the minimum wage to a [[living wage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/14/fight-for-15-protests-fair-minimum-wage|title=Fight for $15 protesters across US demand living wage in day of action|last=Oakland|first=Jana Kasperkevic Ronnie Cohen in|date=2016-04-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the start of these protests, a number of states and cities have increased their minimum wage. In 2014 [[Connecticut]] for instance passed legislation to raise the minimum wage from $8.70 to $10.10 per hour by 2017, making it one of about six states at the time to aim at or above $10.00 per hour.&lt;ref name="ncsl.org"&gt;{{cite web |title= 2016 Minimum Wage by State |url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-minimum-wage-chart.aspx |work=ncsl.org |publisher=NCSL|  accessdate=October 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 and 2015, several cities, including San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C. passed ordinances that gradually increase the minimum wage to $15.00 per hour.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150519"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Medina |first1=Jennifer |last2=Scheiber |first2=Noam |title=Los Angeles Lifts Its Minimum Wage to $15 Per Hour |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/us/los-angeles-expected-to-raise-minimum-wage-to-15-an-hour.html |date=May 19, 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=May 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150520"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title=A $15 Minimum Wage Bombshell in Los Angeles |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/21/opinion/a-15-minimum-wage-bombshell-in-los-angeles.html |date=May 20, 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=May 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 New York and California became the first states to pass legislation that would gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour in each state,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ny.gov/new-york-states-minimum-wage/new-york-states-minimum-wage|title=New York State's Minimum Wage|date=2016-09-20|work=Welcome to the State of New York|access-date=2017-04-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_minimumwage.htm|title=Minimum wage|last=Enforcement|first=Division of Labor Standards|website=Dir.ca.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Massachusetts in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbur.org/news/2018/06/28/baker-to-sign-bill-hiking-minimum-wage-requiring-paid-leave $15 Minimum Wage, Required Paid Leave Are Coming To Mass., After Gov.

In April 2014, the U.S. Senate debated the minimum wage on the federal level by way of the [[Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 1737; 113th Congress)|Minimum Wage Fairness Act]]. The bill would have amended the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938]] (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour over the course of a two-year period.&lt;ref name="1737sum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1737|title=S. 1737 – Summary|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was strongly supported by President [[Barack Obama]] and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House.&lt;ref name="ObamaClearChoice"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/202475-obama-congress-has-clear-choice-on-minimum-wage|title=Obama: Congress has 'clear choice' on minimum wage|last=Sink|first=Justin|date=2 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reidpunts"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/202964-reid-punts-on-minimum-wage-hike|title=Reid punts on minimum-wage hike|last=Bolton|first=Alexander|date=8 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CentristRepubs"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/202641-centrist-republicans-cool-to-wage-compromise|title=Centrist Republicans cool to minimum wage hike compromise|last=Bolton|first=Alexander|date=4 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|accessdate=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2014, voters in the Republican-controlled states of Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota considered ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage above the national rate of $7.25 per hour, which were successful in all four states. The results provided evidence that raising minimum wage has support across party lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/15/us-usa-politics-wage-idUSKBN0HA09E20140915|title=A minimum-wage hike finds hope in U.S. heartland|last1=Sullivan|first1=Andy|date=September 15, 2014|accessdate=15 September 2014|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] and Senator [[Patty Murray]], backed by 28 of the Senate's Democrats, introduced new federal legislation which would raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2024 and index it to inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/04/26/sanders-and-21-democrats-introduce-bill-to-raise-minimum-wage-to-15-an-hour/|title=Sanders and 21 Democrats introduce bill to raise minimum wage to $15 an hour|last=Weigel|first=David|date=2017-04-26|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Raise the Wage Act of 2017, which was simultaneously introduced in the House of Representatives with 166 Democratic cosponsors, would raise the minimum wage to $9.25 per hour immediately, and then gradually increase it to $15 per hour by 2024, while simultaneously raising the minimum wage for tipped workers and phasing it out.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/15&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation was introduced according to Senator Bernie Sanders to make sure that every worker has at least a modest and decent standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/335227-sanders-democrats-introduce-15-minimum-wage-bill|title=Sanders, Democrats introduce $15 minimum wage bill|last=Carney|first=Jordain|date=2017-05-25|work=TheHill|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State laws ===
[[File:State minimum wage.png|thumbnail|upright=1.0|right|Minimum wage by state]]
In the United States, different states are able to set their own minimum wages independent of the federal government. When the state and federal minimum wage differ the higher wage prevails. As of January 2018, there were 29 states with a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; [[Washington (state)|Washington]] has the highest state minimum wage at $11.50 per hour.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/america.htm|title=Minimum Wage Laws in the States – Wage and Hour Division (WHD) – U.S. Department of Labor|website=www.dol.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of states have also in recent years enacted state preemption laws, which restrict local community rights, and bar local governments from setting their own minimum wage amounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.epi.org/publication/city-governments-are-raising-standards-for-working-people-and-state-legislators-are-lowering-them-back-down/|title=City governments are raising standards for working people—and state legislators are lowering them back down|work=Economic Policy Institute|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, state preemption laws for local minimum wages have passed in 25 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.epi.org/preemption-map/|title=Worker rights preemption in the US: A map of the campaign to suppress worker rights in the states|work=Economic Policy Institute|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legislation has passed recently in multiple states that significantly raises the minimum wage. California is set to raise its minimum wage to $15.00 per hour by January 1, 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_minimumwage.htm|title=Minimum wage|last=Enforcement|first=Division of Labor Standards|website=Dir.ca.gov|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colorado is set to raise its minimum wage from $9.30 per hour to $12 per hour by January 1, 2020, rising $0.90 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/cdle/minimumwage|title=Minimum Wage - Colorado Department of Labor and Employment|website=Colorado.gov|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York has also passed legislation to increase its minimum wage to $15.00 per hour over time, certain counties and larger companies are set on faster schedules than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-cuomo-signs-15-minimum-wage-plan-and-12-week-paid-family-leave-policy-law|title=Governor Cuomo Signs $15 Minimum Wage Plan and 12 Week Paid Family Leave Policy into Law|date=4 April 2016|website=Governor.ny.gov|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other cities and states across the country are also debating and enacting legislation to increase the minimum wage for low wage workers to a livable wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm|title=Minimum Wage - Wage and Hour Division (WHD) - U.S. Department of Labor|website=Dol.gov|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Local ordinances ===
Some government entities, such as counties and cities, observe minimum wages that are higher than the state as a whole. In 2003 [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] were the first two cities to introduce [[Local ordinance|local minimum wage ordinances]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;http://www.nelp.org/content/uploads/City-Minimum-Wage-Laws-Recent-Trends-Economic-Evidence.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Another device to increase wages locally are [[living wage]] ordinances, which generally apply only to businesses that are under contract to the local government itself. In 1994 [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]] was the first city in the United States to pass such a living wage ordinance. These targeted living wage ordinances for city contract workers have led in subsequent years to citywide local minimum wage laws which apply to all workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.epi.org/publication/webfeatures_viewpoints_lw_movement/|title=The Living Wage Movement—Viewpoints {{!}} EPI|work=Economic Policy Institute|access-date=2018-03-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the current wave of minimum wage legislative action, [[Seattle, Washington]] was the first city to pass on June 2, 2014 a local ordinance to increase the minimum wage for all workers to $15.00 per hour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sheridan|first1=Robert|title=Minimum Wage Groundswell?

===Union exemptions===
Some minimum wage ordinances have an exemption for unionized workers. For instance, the [[Los Angeles City Council]] approved a minimum salary in 2014 for hotel workers of $15.37 per hour which has such an exemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/r-los-angeles-mayor-signs-15/hour-minimum-wage-hike-into-law-2015-6|title=The mayor of Los Angeles just signed a $15/hr minimum wage bill into law|date=13 June 2015|work=Business Insider|accessdate=11 April 2016|agency=Reuters|quote=The city council in September approved a pay increase for hotel workers to $15.37 an hour.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led in some cases to longtime workers at unionized hotels such as the Sheraton Universal making $10.00 per hour, whereas non-union employees at a non-union Hilton less than 500 feet away making at least $15.37 as mandated by law for non-unionized employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/cityhall/la-me-union-minimum-wage-20160410-story.html|title=Outrage after big labor crafts law paying their members less than non-union workers|last1=Peter|first1=Jamison|date=9 April 2016|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=11 April 2016|quote=At the Sheraton Universal Hotel, a longtime union property, bellhops, waiters and banquet servers make California's current minimum wage: $10 an hour. (When the hotel ordinance first went into effect, the state minimum was $9.)  Those doing the same jobs at a non-union Hilton less than 500 feet away make at least $15.37 under the city's hotel wage law. Neither amount includes tips.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar exemptions have been adopted in other cities. As of December 2014, unions were exempt from minimum wage ordinances in [[Chicago, Illinois]], [[SeaTac, Washington]], and [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin]], as well as the California cities of [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Richmond, California|Richmond]], and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]].&lt;ref name="Wash Exam Dec 24, 2014"/&gt; In 2016, the [[Council of the District of Columbia|Washington, D.C. Council]] passed a minimum wage ordinance that included a union waiver, but Mayor Vincent Gray vetoed it. Later that year, the council approved an increase without the union waiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/minimum-wage-loophole-written-to-help-unions/article/2557806|title=Minimum wage loophole written to help labor unions|last=Higgins|first=Sean|work=Washington Examiner|access-date=2017-05-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From September 1, 1997 through July 23, 2007, the federal minimum wage remained constant at $5.15 per hour, breaking the old record.

The [[purchasing power]] of the federal minimum wage has fluctuated. Since 1984, the purchasing power of the federal minimum wage has decreased. Measured in real terms (adjusted for inflation) using 1984 dollars, the real minimum wage was $3.35 in 1984, $2.33 in 1994, $1.84 in 2004, and $1.46 in 2014.&lt;ref name="calc" /&gt; If the minimum wage had been raised to $10.10 in 2014, that would have equated to $4.40 in 1984 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CPIAUCSL|title=Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: All Items|date=13 October 2017|website=Research.stlouisfed.org|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm|title=Minimum Wage – Wage and Hour Division (WHD) – U.S. Department of Labor|website=Dol.gov|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have been equal to a 31% increase in purchasing power, despite the nominal value of the minimum wage increasing by 216% in the same time period.

The economic effects of raising the minimum wage are controversial. Adjusting the minimum wage may affect current and future levels of employment, prices of goods and services, economic growth, income inequality, and poverty. The interconnection of price levels, central bank policy, wage agreements, and total aggregate demand creates a situation in which conclusions drawn from macroeconomic analysis are highly influenced by the underlying assumptions of the interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;For a review article that analyzes the classical, Keynesian, and underconsumptionist approaches to wages, see {{cite journal|last=Weintraub|first=Sidney|title=A Macroeconomic Approach to the Theory of Wages|journal=The American Economic Review|date=December 1956|volume=46|issue=5|pages=835–56|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1811907?uid=3739840&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102726542297|accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Employment ===

In [[neoclassical economics]], the [[law of demand]] states that—all else being equal—raising the price of any particular good or service reduces the quantity demanded.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Microeconomic Theory: Basic Principles and Extensions|last=Nicholson|first=Walter|last2=Snyder|first2=Christopher|publisher=South-Western|year=2012|isbn=978-111-1-52553-8|edition=11|location=Mason, OH|pages=27,154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, neoclassical economists argue that—all else being equal—raising the minimum wage will have adverse effects on employment. Conceptually, if an employer does not believe a worker generates value equal to or in excess of the minimum wage, they do not hire or retain that worker.&lt;ref name="Hazlitt 1979"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hazlitt | first = Henry | authorlink = Henry Hazlitt | year = 1979 | title = [[Economics in One Lesson]] | publisher = Three Rivers Press | isbn = 0-517-54823-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other economists of different schools of thought argue that a limited increase in the minimum wage does not affect or increases the number of jobs available. Economist David Cooper for instance estimates that a higher minimum wage would support the creation of at least 85,000 new jobs in the United States.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/score-does-minimum-wage-kill-jobs/|title=The Score: Does the Minimum Wage Kill Jobs?|last=Konczal|first=Mike|date=2014-10-08|work=The Nation|access-date=2017-12-12|last2=Covert|first2=Bryce|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt; This divergence of thought began with empirical work on fast food workers in the 1990s which challenged the neoclassical model. In 1994, economists [[David Card]] and [[Alan Krueger]] studied employment trends among 410 restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania following New Jersey's minimum wage hike (from $4.25 to $5.05) in April 1992. They found "no indication that the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/njmin-aer.pdf|title=Alan Krueger and David Card. "Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania"|website=Davidcard.berkeley.edu|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a 1995 analysis of the evidence by [[David Neumark]] found that the increase in New Jersey's minimum wage resulted in a 4.6% decrease in employment. Neumark's study relied on payroll records from a sample of large fast-food restaurant chains, whereas the Card-Krueger study relied on business surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Neumark |first2=William |last2=Wascher |title=Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania: Comment |journal=American Economic Review |year=2000 |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=1362–1396 |doi=10.1257/aer.90.5.1362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CBO Projected Effects of Minimum Wage Increases v1.png|thumb|upright=1.1|right|CBO table with projections of the effects of minimum wage increases on employment and income, under two scenarios]]
A [[literature review]] conducted by David Neumark and William Wascher in 2007 (which surveyed 101 studies related to the employment effects of minimum wages) found that about two-thirds of peer-reviewed economic research showed a positive correlation between minimum wage hikes and increased unemployment—especially for young and unskilled workers. Neumark's review further found that, when looking at only the most credible research, 85% of studies showed a positive correlation between minimum wage hikes and increased unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;Neumark, Wascher (2007). [http://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/MIC-015 Minimum Wages and Employment.] ''Foundations and Trends® in Microeconomics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meta-analysis|Statistical meta-analysis]] conducted by Tom Stanley in 2005 in contrast found that there is evidence of [[publication bias]] in minimum wage literature, and that correction of this bias shows no relationship between the minimum wage and unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stanley|first1=T. D.|year=2005|title=Beyond Publication Bias|journal=Journal of Economic Surveys|volume=19|issue=3|page=309|doi=10.1111/j.0950-0804.2005.00250.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Hristos Doucouliagos and Tom Stanley conducted a similar meta-analysis of 64 U.S. studies on disemployment effects and concluded that Card and Krueger's initial claim of publication bias was correct. Moreover, they concluded, "Once this publication selection is corrected, little or no evidence of a negative association between minimum wages and employment remains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doucouliagos|first1=Hristos|last2=Stanley|first2=T.

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) in 2014 estimated the theoretical effects of a federal minimum wage increase under two scenarios: an increase to $9.00 and an increase to $10.10. According to the report, approximately 100,000 jobs would be lost under the $9.00 option, whereas 500,000 jobs would be lost under the $10.10 option (with a wide range of possible outcomes).&lt;ref name="CBOMinWage1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cbo.gov/publication/44995|title= The Effects of a Minimum Wage Increase on Employment and Family Income | author = CBO|date=February 2014| accessdate = November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]] (CEPR) in contrast in 2013 found in a review of multiple studies since 2000 that there was "little or no employment response to modest increases in the minimum wage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/min-wage-2013-02.pdf|title=Center for Economic and Policy Research.

A 2012 study led by Joseph Sabia estimated that the 2004-6 New York State minimum wage increase (from $5.15 to $6.75) resulted in a 20.2% to 21.8% reduction in employment for less-skilled, less-educated workers.&lt;ref&gt;Sabia, Burkhauser, Hansen (2012).

''Industrial and Labor Relations Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a study led by Richard Burkhauser in 2000 concluded that minimum wage increases "significantly reduce the employment of the most vulnerable groups in the working-age population—young adults without a high school degree (aged 20-24), young black adults and teenagers (aged 16-24), and teenagers (aged 16-19)."&lt;ref&gt;Burkhauser, Couch, Wittenburg (2000).

''[[The Economist]]'' wrote in December 2013 in sum that: "A minimum wage, providing it is not set too high, could thus boost pay with no ill effects on jobs...Some studies find no harm to employment from federal or state minimum wages, others see a small one, but none finds any serious damage...High minimum wages, however, particularly in rigid labour markets, do appear to hit employment. France has the rich world's highest wage floor, at more than 60% of the median for adults and a far bigger fraction of the typical wage for the young. This helps explain why France also has shockingly high rates of youth unemployment: 26% for 15- to 24-year-olds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21591593-moderate-minimum-wages-do-more-good-harm-they-should-be-set-technocrats-not|title=The Logical Floor|work=The Economist | date=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prices===
Conceptually, raising the minimum wage increases the cost of labor, [[ceteris paribus]]. Thus, employers may accept lower profits, raise their prices, or both. If prices increase, consumers may demand a lesser quantity of the product, [[Substitute good|substitute other products]], or switch to imported products, due to the effects of [[price elasticity of demand]]. Marginal producers (those who are barely profitable enough to survive) may be forced out of business if they cannot raise their prices sufficiently to offset the higher cost of labor. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago research from 2007 has shown that restaurant prices rise in response to minimum wage increases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2004/wp2004_21.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''The Minimum Wage, Restaurant Prices, and Labor Market Structure'', August 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are studies that show that higher prices for products due to increased labor cost are usually only by about 0.4% of the original price.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Effects on crime===
A 2016 White House report based on "back of envelope calculations and literature review" argued that higher hourly wages led to less crime.&lt;ref name="theatlantic_2017"&gt;{{citation |url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/page/files/20160423_cea_incarceration_criminal_justice.pdf |work=COEA |date=March 3, 2017 |accessdate=March 3, 2017 |title=Raise the Minimum Wage, Reduce Crime? A new White House report links higher hourly incomes to lower rates of law-breaking.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study by the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] calculated that "raising the minimum wage reduces crime by 3 to 5 percent." To get those numbers, the study assumed that "such a minimum wage increase would have no employment impacts, with an employment elasticity of 0.1 the benefits would be somewhat lower."&lt;ref name="theatlantic_2017" /&gt;

In contrast in a 1987 journal article, Masanori Hashimoto noted that minimum wage hikes lead to increased levels of property crime in areas affected by the minimum wage after its increase.&lt;ref name="Hashimoto_1987"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Minimum Wage Law and Youth Crimes: Time-Series Evidence|first=Masanori|last=Hashimoto|date=18 October 1987|journal=The Journal of Law &amp; Economics|volume=30|issue=2|pages=443–64|doi=10.2307/725504|jstor=725504}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the article, by decreasing employment in poor communities, total legal trade and production are curtailed. The report also argued that to compensate for the decrease in legal avenues for production and consumption, poor communities increasingly turn to illegal trade and activity.&lt;ref name="Hashimoto_1987" /&gt;

===Economic growth===
Whether growth (GDP, a measure of both income and production) increases or decreases depends significantly on whether the income shifted from owners to workers results in an overall higher level of spending. The tendency of a consumer to spend their next dollar is referred to as the [[marginal propensity to consume]] or MPC. The transfer of income from higher income owners (who tend to save more, meaning a lower MPC) to lower income workers (who tend to save less, with a higher MPC) can actually lead to an increase in total consumption and higher demand for goods, leading to increased employment.&lt;ref name="CBOMinWage1"/&gt; Recent research has shown that higher wages lead to greater productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/higher-wages-low-income-workers-lead-higher-productivity|title=Higher Wages for Low-Income Workers Lead to Higher Productivity|date=13 January 2015|website=Piie.com|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBO reported in February 2014 that income (GDP) overall would be marginally higher after raising the minimum wage, indicating a small net positive increase in growth. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 and indexing it to inflation would result in a net $2 billion increase in income during the second half of 2016, while raising it to $9.00 and not indexing it would result in a net $1 billion increase in income.&lt;ref name="CBOMinWage1"/&gt;

===Income inequality===
{{Further|Income inequality in the United States}}
[[File:Minimum to Median Wage OECD 2016.png|upright=1.0|thumb|Minimum wage levels in developed economies as a share of median full-time wage. The relative minimum wage ratio in the U.S. is shown in red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MIN2AVE#|title=OECD Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Stats.oecd.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611034108/http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MIN2AVE|archive-date=2009-06-11|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An increase in the minimum wage is a form of redistribution from higher-income persons (business owners or "capital") to lower income persons (workers or "labor") and therefore should reduce income inequality. The CBO estimated in February 2014 that raising the minimum wage under either scenario described above would improve income inequality. Families with income more than 6 times the poverty threshold would see their incomes fall (due in part to their business profits declining with higher employee costs), while families with incomes below that threshold would rise.&lt;ref name="CBOMinWage1"/&gt;

===Poverty===
Among hourly-paid workers In 2016, 701,000 earned the federal minimum wage and about 1.5 million earned wages below the minimum.Together, these 2.2 million workers represented 2.7% of all hourly-paid workers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/minimum-wage/2016/home.htm Characteristics of Minimum Wage Workers, 2016]. US Department of Labor.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBO estimated in February 2014 that raising the minimum wage would reduce the number of persons below the poverty income threshold by 900,000 under the $10.10 option versus 300,000 under the $9.00 option.&lt;ref name="CBOMinWage1"/&gt; Similarly, Arindrajit Dube, professor of economics at University of Massachusetts Amherst, found in a 2017 study "robust evidence that higher minimum wages lead to increases in incomes among families at the bottom of the income distribution and that these wages reduce the poverty rate." According to the study "a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduces the nonelderly poverty rate by about 5 percent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dube|first=Arindrajit|date=February 2017|title=Minimum Wages and the Distribution of Family Incomes|ssrn=2923658|journal=IZA Discussion Paper No. 10572|language=en|location=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://equitablegrowth.org/research-analysis/minimum-wages-and-the-distribution-of-family-incomes-in-the-us/|title=Minimum wages and the distribution of family incomes in the United States {{!}} Equitable Growth|date=2017-04-26|work=Equitable Growth|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, research conducted by [[David Neumark]] and colleagues in 2004 found that minimum wages are associated with reductions in the hours and employment of low-wage workers.&lt;ref&gt;Neumark, Shweitzer, Wascher (2004). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3559021?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents The Effects of Minimum Wages Throughout the Wage Distribution.] ''Journal of Human Resources.''&lt;/ref&gt; A separate study by the same researchers found that minimum wages tend to increase the proportion of families with incomes below or near the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;Neumark, Shweitzer, Wascher (2005). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4129543?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents The Effects of Minimum Wages on the Distribution of Family Incomes: A Non-Parametric Analysis.] ''Journal of Human Resources.''&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 2002 study led by [[Richard Vedder]], professor of economics at [[Ohio University]], concluded that "The empirical evidence is strong that minimum wages have had little or no effect on poverty in the U.S. Indeed, the evidence is stronger that minimum wages occasionally increase poverty…"&lt;ref&gt;Vedder, Gallaway (2002). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12122-002-1016-4 The minimum wage and poverty among full-time workers]. ''Journal of Labor Research''.&lt;/ref&gt;

When minimum wage increases; workers who have a lower income might lose their job. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/report/15-minimum-wages-will-substantially-raise-prices|title=$15 Minimum Wages Will Substantially Raise Prices|last=Sherk|first=James|website=The Heritage Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal budget deficit===
The CBO reported in February 2014 that "[T]he net effect on the federal budget of raising the minimum wage would probably be a small decrease in budget deficits for several years but a small increase in budget deficits thereafter. It is unclear whether the effect for the coming decade as a whole would be a small increase or a small decrease in budget deficits." On the cost side, the report cited higher wages paid by the government to some of its employees along with higher costs for certain procured goods and services. This might be offset by fewer government benefits paid, as some workers with higher incomes would receive fewer government transfer payments. On the revenue side, some would pay higher taxes and others less.&lt;ref name="CBOMinWage1"/&gt;

According to a survey conducted by economist [[Greg Mankiw]], 79% of economists agreed that "a minimum wage increases unemployment among young and unskilled workers."&lt;ref&gt;Mankiw, N.G. [https://books.google.com/books?id=SNe5DQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=essentials+of+economics+mankiw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA0bKZxPnUAhUQ5WMKHeDiCEQQ6wEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=essentials%20of%20economics%20mankiw&amp;f=false Essentials of Economics, 8th Edition.] Cengage Learning, pp. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 survey conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center found that a majority of economists believes raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would have negative effects on youth employment levels (83%), adult employment levels (52%), and the number of jobs available (76%). Additionally, 67% of economists surveyed believed that a $15 minimum wage would make it harder for small businesses with less than 50 employees to stay in business.&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, Smith (2015).

In 2014, over 600 economists signed a letter in support of increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 with research suggesting that a minimum wage increase could have a small stimulative effect on the economy as low-wage workers spend their additional earnings, raising demand and job growth.&lt;ref name="epi.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epi.org/minimum-wage-statement/|title=Over 600 Economists Sign Letter In Support of $10.10 Minimum Wage: Economist Statement on the Federal Minimum Wage|website=Epi.org|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/27/economists-minimum-wage_n_4675290.html | work=Huffington Post | title=600 Economists Now Back A $10.10 Minimum Wage | date=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/14/opinion/economists-hit-back-in-the-minimum-wage-wars.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | title=Economists Hit Back in the Minimum-Wage Wars | date=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalmemo.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmemo.com/over-600-economists-agree-its-time-to-raise-the-minimum-wage/|title=Over 600 Economists Agree: It's Time To Raise The Minimum Wage - The National Memo - Smart.

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] advocated raising the minimum wage moderately in 2013, citing several reasons, including:
* The minimum wage was below its 1960s purchasing power, despite a near doubling of productivity;
* The great preponderance of the evidence indicates there is no negative impact on employment from moderate increases; and
* A high level of public support, specifically Democrats and Republican women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/opinion/krugman-raise-that-wage.html|title=Opinion - Raise That Wage|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=17 February 2013|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Support crosses party lines, with support from 91% of Democrats, 74% of Independents, and 50% of Republicans; and

== List by jurisdiction ==
This is a list of the [[minimum wage]]s (per hour) in each state and territory of the United States, for jobs covered by federal minimum wage laws. If the job is not subject to the federal [[Fair Labor Standards Act]], then state, city, or other local laws may determine the minimum wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minimum-wage.org/wage-by-state.asp |title=United States Minimum Wage By State 2013 |publisher=Minimum-Wage.org |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A common exemption to the federal minimum wage is a company having revenue of less than $500,000 per year while not engaging in any interstate commerce.

Under the federal law, workers who receive a portion of their salary from tips, such as waitstaff, are required only to have their total compensation, including tips, meet the minimum wage. Therefore, often, their hourly wage, before tips, is less than the minimum wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/minwage.pdf | work=US Department of Labor – Wage and Hour Division | title=Employee Rights Under the Fair Labor Standards Act | accessdate=September 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven states, and Guam, do not allow for a tip credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minimum Wages for Tipped Employees|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/state/tipped.htm|work=U.S. Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional exemptions to the minimum wage include many seasonal employees, student employees, and certain disabled employees as specified by the FLSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.minimum-wage.org/minimum-wage-exemptions.asp | work=Minimum-Wage.org | title=Exemptions to the Minimum Wage and the FLSA | date=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, some counties and cities within states may implement a higher minimum wage than the rest of their state. Sometimes this higher wage applies only to businesses that contract with the local government, while in other cases the higher minimum applies to all work.

Employers not covered by the FLSA will be subject to a minimum wage that is at least 70 percent of the federal minimum wage or the applicable mandatory decree rate, whichever is higher. The Secretary of Labor and Human Resources may authorize a rate based on a lower percentage for any employer who can show that implementation of the 70 percent rate would substantially curtail employment in that business. Puerto Rico also has minimum wage rates that vary according to the industry. These rates range from a minimum of $5.08 to $7.25 per hour.

== Low-paying occupations, 2006 and 2009 ==
Jobs that a minimum wage is most likely to directly affect are those that pay close to the minimum.

According to the May 2006 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates, the four lowest-paid occupational sectors in May 2006 (when the federal minimum wage was $5.15 per hour) were the following:&lt;ref name=OES2006&gt;{{cite web | title = National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates United States | work =  | publisher = US Bureau of Labor Statistics | date = May 2006 | url = http://www.bls.gov/oes/2006/may/oes_nat.htm | accessdate = 2013-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, in May 2008, when the federal minimum wage was $5.85 per hour and was about to increase to $6.55 per hour in July 2008, these same sectors were still the lowest-paying, but their situation (according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data)&lt;ref name=OES2008&gt;{{cite web | title = National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates United States | work =  | publisher = US Bureau of Labor Statistics | date = May 2008 | url = http://www.bls.gov/oes/2008/may/oes_nat.htm | accessdate = 2013-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3546">The '''New Hire Registry''' is a program established in the United States pursuant to the ''Personal Responsibility and Work        Opportunity Reconciliation Act'' (PRWORA) of 1996, 42 U.S.C. 653a, which required each state, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government for its own employees, to establish - or contract with a provider to operate - a system where all new hires by any employer must be reported to a state-established New Hire Registry for that state.&lt;ref&gt;http://newhire-reporting.com/va-newhire/FAQ.aspx Virginia New-Hire Reporting Center Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), retrieved 4 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  All employers of employees for wages have been required since 1997 to register with their state for reporting, and to report new hires within 20 days of employment, except employers who file new hire reports electronically, who must file a report every 12 to 16 days. The ostensible purpose of the program is to check for "[[deadbeat parent]]s", e.g. persons not paying required child support orders, but may also be used for abuse of other payment-related programs such as [[unemployment insurance]].

==Who is required to comply==
All employers of employees for wages must register with their state's New Hire Registry, and are required to report to the registry all new hires or all rehires of former employees who have been separated from the employer for more than 60 days. All employees must be reported, including employees who were hired or worked for less than one day,  domestic employees such as a maid, gardener, cook, etc., and seasonal employees.&lt;ref&gt;http://newhire-reporting.com/md-newhire/FAQ.aspx Maryland State Directory of New Hires, Frequently Asked Questions, #4, Retrieved 4 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The law's reporting requirements strictly include all employees for wages. An employer must report all persons who would be considered employees under federal rules for withholding of employment taxes to the state's New Hire Registry. Reporting of [[independent contractor]]s is not required, but is encouraged.

While reporting of employees who are no longer working for the employer may not seem to be helpful, since the report includes the address of the employee, it may be useful in tracking down an employee who has unpaid child support payments or might be committing unemployment insurance fraud.

==Exemptions==
No employer is exempt from reporting new hires, with the exception of Federal intelligence agencies where the director of the agency has determined that reporting may jeopardize the safety of certain employees or may compromise National Security.

==Report Format==
The report which is required to be filed includes the name, address and social security number of every new hire, as well as the name, address, and [[Federal Employer Identification Number]] of the employer, for each new hire made within the last 20 days or within the last two weeks for employers filing electronically.

==Single State vs. Multistate Employers==
An employer within a single state files with the New Hire Registry of the state where they operate; multistate employers may choose to either file new hire reports with each state where the employee works, or instead may file a single combined report for all employees for all states where it operates with one state's New Hire Registry, but must not make both reports.

==Requirement of States operating the Registry==

The '''''Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property''''' is a [[law review]] published by an independent student organization at [[Northwestern University School of Law]]. The current [[editor-in-chief]] is Heath Ingram.

==Overview==
The ''Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property'' covers academic, business, and legal issues concerning [[intellectual property]] and [[technology law]]. It publishes articles on a variety of topics including: [[copyright]], [[trademark]], [[patent]]s, the Internet, media, telecommunications, health care, antitrust, e‑discovery, and trial and litigation technology.

The ''Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property'' publishes three full issues each year and five "perspectives" issues. Perspectives issues contain shorter articles detailing a new development in the law of intellectual property or offering a new perspective on more developed issues within the law.

==Symposia==
Every Spring, the journal hosts a symposium on emerging areas of technology and intellectual property law. Recent symposia have included: "New Rules for a New Day: Examining Recent Trends in IP Law" (2010) and "Riding the Wave: Understanding Recent Developments in IP Law" (2009).

'''''Paris v Stepney Borough Council''''' [1950] UKHL 3&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1950/3.html Full text of the decision]&lt;/ref&gt; was a decision of the [[House of Lords]] that significantly affected the concept of [[Standard of care]] in [[common law]]. The plaintiff Paris was employed by the then [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney|Stepney Borough Council]] as a general garage-hand. He had sight in only one eye, and his employer was aware of this.  The council only issued eye protection goggles to its employees who were welders or tool-grinders.  In the course of his usual work, Paris received an injury to his sighted eye.  He sued the council for damages in the [[tort]] of [[negligence]].  On appeal it was decided that Stepney Borough Council was aware of his special circumstances and failed in their [[duty of care]] to give him protective goggles.

The '''power of the purse''' is the ability of one group to [[psychological manipulation|manipulate]] and control the actions of another group by withholding funding, or putting stipulations on the use of funds. The power of the purse can be used [[positive reinforcement|positively]] (e.g. awarding extra funding to programs that reach certain benchmarks) or [[negative punishment|negatively]] (e.g. removing funding for a department or program, effectively eliminating it). The power of the purse is most often utilized by forces within a government that do not have direct [[executive power]], but have control over [[budget]]s and [[taxation]].

== Canada ==
{{further|fiscal federalism}}
In colonial Canada, the fight for "[[responsible government]]" in the 1840s centered on question of whether elected parliaments or appointed governors would have control over the purse strings, mirroring earlier fights between [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] and [[the Crown]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].

After confederation, the phrase "power of the purse" took on a particular meaning.  It now primarily refers to the federal government's superior tax-raising abilities compared to the provinces, and the consequent ability of the federal government to compel provincial governments to adopt certain policies in exchange for [[Canadian transfer payments|transfer payments]].  Most famously, the [[Canada Health Act]] sets rules that provinces adhere to receive health transfers (the largest such transfers). Opponents of this arrangement refer to this situation as the "[[fiscal imbalance in Canada|fiscal imbalance]]", while others argue for the federal government's role in setting minimum standards for [[social programs in Canada]].

==United Kingdom==
The power of the purse's earliest examples in a modern sense occurred in the [[English Parliament]], which gained the exclusive power to authorise taxes and thus could control the nation's cash flow. Through this power, Parliament slowly subverted the executive strength of the crown; [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] was limited in his powers to engage in various war efforts by a refusal by Parliament to authorise further taxes and by his inability to secure loans from foreign nations, making him much less powerful.

In recent years as a result of [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]], funding for devolved issues to the [[Scottish Parliament]] as well as the [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly|Northern Irish]] assemblies has been determined through the [[Barnett formula|Barnett Formula]]. This formula determines the overall budget of the devolved parliaments for devolved issues proportionally relative to spending on those issues in England. As a result, while responsibility for funding of devolved matters rests with the devolved bodies themselves, they in effect must enact policies of a broadly similar cost to those decided by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliament]] for England and maintain that broad proportionality in order to ensure the long term financial viability of such policies.

==United States==
In the federal government of the United States, the power of the purse is vested in the [[United States Congress|Congress]] as laid down in the [[Constitution of the United States]], Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 (the [[Appropriations bill (United States)|Appropriations]] Clause) and Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 (the Taxing and Spending Clause).

The power of the purse plays a critical role in the [[separation of powers|relationship]] of the [[United States Congress]] and the [[President of the United States]], and has been the main historic tool by which Congress has limited executive power. One of the most prominent examples is the [[Foreign Assistance Act of 1974]], which eliminated all military funding for the government of [[South Vietnam]] and thereby ended the [[Vietnam War]]. Other recent examples include limitations on military funding placed on [[Ronald Reagan]] by Congress, which led to the withdrawal of [[United States Marines]] from [[Lebanon]].

The power of the purse in military affairs was famously subverted during the [[Iran-Contra scandal]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cutting Off Nicaragua's Contras|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,950076,00.html|date=Jul 9, 1984|author=Barrett Seaman;Alessandra Stanley |publisher=TIME|accessdate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Congress denied further aid to the [[Contras]] in [[Nicaragua]]. Unwilling to accept the will of Congress, members of the [[Reagan administration]] solicited private [[donation]]s, set up elaborate corporate schemes and brokered illegal arms deals with Iran in order to generate unofficial funds that could not be regulated by Congress.

More recently, budget limitations and using the power of the purse formed a controversial part of discussion regarding Congressional opposition to the [[Iraq War]]. On March 23, 2007, the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] passed a supplemental war budget that imposed a timeline on the presence of American combat troops in Iraq, but the legislation was not passed.

The power of the purse has also been used to compel the [[U.S. state]]s to pass laws, in cases where Congress does not have the desire or [[U.S. constitution|constitutional]] power to make it a federal matter.  The most well-known example of this is regarding the [[drinking age]], where Congress passed a law to withhold 10% of federal funds for highways in any state that did not raise the age to 21.  The law was upheld by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in the ''[[South Dakota v. Dole]]'' case.  Congress was not allowed to change the drinking age directly because the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]] (which ended [[Prohibition]] in the U.S.) gave control of alcohol to the states.  In 2009, Congress considered similar legislation regarding [[texting while driving]].

This power was curtailed somewhat in a case regarding the [[Affordable Care Act]], in which the Supreme Court ruled in June 2012 that the law's withholding of all existing [[Medicaid]] funding for states that failed or refused to expand their Medicaid programs to cover the uninsured [[poverty|poor]] was "unduly [[coercive]]", despite the fact that the federal government would pay the entirety of the states' expansion for the first years, and 90% thereafter.  It was left unclear what percentage would be considered acceptable.

==Other uses==
In the US Congress or Senate, the chairperson of a [[legislative committee]] may refuse to give funding to a senator or other delegate or representative, or deny his or her appropriations bill or amendment a vote, because he or she refused to support a bill which the chairperson wanted (a [[tit-for-tat]] retaliation).  While typically applied to "[[pork barrel]]" spending for [[special interest]]s, it may also block funding for genuine needs of a [[constituency]] or the general [[public]].

The administration or [[student government]] at a college or [[university]] may revoke some or even all funding for a [[student newspaper]] or [[student radio]] station, because it has printed or aired an [[editorial]] or a [[news]] article or [[segment (broadcasting)|segment]] critical of it.  This is also an example of [[censorship]].

The “3rd antimonopoly package”, which entered into force in January 2012, is indicative of a general trend of [[liberalization]] of antimonopoly regulation.&lt;ref name=ppt /&gt; Indeed, its stated aim was to bring Russia more in line with [[European Union competition law|European competition]] regulations.

==History==
Russian competition law was ratified by the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the [[USSR]] in March 1991. In the final stages of [[glasnost]] and the deteriorating tethering of the [[USSR]], the various member soviet republics saw the need for regulation and stabilisation of trade. The representatives to the [[Supreme Soviet]] of the [[USSR]] ratified the Law on Competition and Limitation of Monopolistic Activity in Goods Market in March 1991 which became anti-monopoly policies within Russia after secession from the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| title =  Legislating Competition in the Russian Federation: A New Challenge for Antitrust Policy
| publisher = Antitrust Bulletin| volume = December 22, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Law on the Protection of Competition of 2006 is legislation pursued to translate those policies back into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| url = http://www.conseco.ru/eng/abc/anti-monopoly.html| title =  Anti-Monopoly Regulation| publisher = Conseco Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| url = http://www.usrccne.org/news2.phtml?m=278| title =  Russia's New Anti-Monopoly Law: A Brief Review| year = 2006| publisher = Russia/Eurasia Executive Guide| author = Brian L. Zimbler and Kirill Okorochenkov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal Law No. 135-FZ==
Federal Law No. 135-FZ, “On the Protection of Competition", was legislated on July 26, 2006, and entered into force on October 26, 2006.

===Federal Antimonopoly Service ===
The law was "initiated and developed" by the [[Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia]] (FAS) ({{lang-ru|Федеральная антимонопольная служба России, ФАС России}}), the federal-level [[executive (government)|executive]] governmental organ that controls the execution of antitrust and competition. Headed by [[Igor Artemyev]], it had been established by the [[Ukase|Decree]] of [[President of Russia]] №314 on March 9, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.fas.gov.ru/ Federal Antimonopoly Service website (English)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The law also gives the FAS authority over approval of company mergers stipulating various combinations of thresholds of assets of merging companies, an excess of which would require prior approval from the FAS. The scope of regulation of the FAS is focused on the commodity market and financial services with mandates over operations and transactions not just within the Russian Federation but also those taking place outside the boundaries of Russia which would have anti-competitive effects on the Russian market place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| url = http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=32690
| title =  Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service is at Law with Microsoft| year = 2009| publisher = PanARMENIAN}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the trend in the [[United States v. Microsoft|United States]] and the [[European Union Microsoft competition case|European Union]], the FAS has also taken [[Microsoft litigation|Microsoft]] to task for anti-competitive behaviour by bringing Microsoft to court on 4 June 2009.

===Dominance===
Beyond western European competition laws against dominance, the Competition Law in Russia expressly presumes the existence of dominance by defining thresholds.
* A company is "presumed dominant" if it has more than 50% of [[market share]]
* Dominance must be established by FAS if a company has more than 35% of market share&lt;ref name=ppt /&gt;
* A company with less than 35% of market share is generally not considered dominant unless FAS establishes a case for dominance based on factors like analyses of competition on the market and stability of market share
* '''Collective dominance''' exists if the market share of each entity exceeds 8% ''and'' the aggregate market share:&lt;ref name=ppt /&gt;
**Exceeds 50% for not more than 3 entities
**Exceeds 75% for not more than 5 entities
* A safe harbour [[Margin (finance)|margin]] of up to 20% market share per company for agreements between companies of different segments of a [[supply chain]]

===Other provisions===
The law also places restrictions on aids from, and [[public procurement]] policies of, federal, provincial, or municipal governments that otherwise would encourage anti-competition.

In addition to a distinct competition law, the Code of Administrative Offences has also been amended to increase liability of anti-competitive practices. Punitive measures against anti-competitive practices are meted out in terms of percentages of revenues of a company. Company directors can be criminally liable in cases of a repeated abuse—e.g.,&amp;nbsp;establishing high monopoly or low monopoly prices, unjustified evasion from the execution of contracts with individual customers, creation of obstacles for other entities entering the market—and can be sentenced to up to 7 years in prison.&lt;ref name=ppt /&gt;

In [[finance]], '''seniority''' refers to the order of repayment in the event of a sale or [[bankruptcy]] of the issuer. Seniority can refer to either [[debt]] or [[preferred stock]]. Senior debt must be repaid before subordinated (or junior) debt is repaid.&lt;ref&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of Businessurt Publishing Company, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Each security, either debt or equity, that a company issues has a specific seniority or ranking. Bonds that have the same seniority in a company's [[capital structure]] are described as being [[pari passu]]. Preferred stock is '''senior''' to common stock in a sale when preferred shareholders must receive back their '''preference''', typically their original investment amount, before the common shareholders receive anything.

==FpML==
The seniority of bonds recognised in [[FpML]] (Financial products Markup Language) are as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! FpML value
! Description
|-
| Senior
| Top precedence
|-
| SubTier3
| Subordinate, Tier 3
|-
| SubUpperTier2
| Subordinate, Upper Tier 2
|-
| SubLowerTier2
| Subordinate, Lower Tier 2
|-
| SubTier1
| Subordinate, Tier 1

[[File:GIL-sharism.jpg|thumb|Get It Louder Sharism exhibition in Shanghai]]

'''Sharism''' is a philosophy on [[sharing]] content and ideas, developed by [[Isaac Mao]]. Inspired by [[user-generated content]], sharism states that the act of sharing something within a community produces a proper value for each of its participants: "the more you share, the more you receive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Philips|first=Jon|title=Sharism: The more you share, the more you receive|url=http://www.slideshare.net/rejon/sharism-the-more-you-share-the-more-you-receive|accessdate=May 28, 2012|location=Slideshare}}&lt;/ref&gt; As knowledge is produced through [[crowdsourcing]], this new kind of shared ownership leads to the production of goods and services where value is distributed through the contributions of everyone involved.

== History ==
''Sharism'' was coined by [[Isaac Mao]] in the essay "Sharism: A Mind Revolution" which was originally published in the book ''[[Freesouls]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://freesouls.cc/essays/07-isaac-mao-sharism.html&lt;/ref&gt; Mao draws a comparison between the open distribution model of online information sharing and the neurological networks of the human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ito |first1=Joi |last2=Mao |first2=Isaac |first3=Christopher (ed.) |last3=Adams |title=Freesouls Captured and Released by Joi Ito|publisher=Freesouls.cc |date=December 12, 2008 |origyear=1st. Pub. 2008 |pages=115–118 |chapter=Chapter 8: Sharism: A Mind Revolution |chapterurl=http://freesouls.cc/essays/07-isaac-mao-sharism.html |isbn=978-0982029114 |lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the analogy of an emerging Social Brain, Mao argues that the process of empowering people through sharing leads to collective ways of rethinking social relationships.

Sharism has been particularly focused in [[China]] in order to promote the [[Open Web]] and combat Internet censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=We Share. We Do Not Censor|url=http://www.we-magazine.net/we-volume-03/we-share-we-do-not-censor/| accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable proponents of sharism as both a term and practice have included [[Larry Lessig]] and [[Ou Ning]]. In 2010 during a [[Creative Commons]] lecture in [[Beijing]], Lessig mentioned sharism in the context of openness and innovation in creative industries and intellectual property law in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |title=Openness and Innovation - 开放与创新 |first=Larry |last=Lessig |work=Renmin University of China Law School, Intellectual Property Institute |location=Renmin University of China, Beijing |date=November 14, 2010 |url=http://creativecommons.net.cn/2010/10/30/1-8/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222185120/http://creativecommons.net.cn/2010/10/30/1-8/ |archivedate=February 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }} See also {{cite web |url=http://creativecommons.net.cn/2010/11/17/1-10/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222185552/http://creativecommons.net.cn/2010/11/17/1-10/ |archivedate=February 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}, {{cite web |url=http://creativecommons.net.cn/2011/05/20/4-4/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209111848/http://creativecommons.net.cn/2011/05/20/4-4/ |archivedate=February 9, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2010, Ou in his role as a curator choose sharism as the unifying theme for the [[Shanghai]] biennale exhibition "Get It Louder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Get It Louder: Sharism Forum Introduction| url=http://2010.getitlouder.com/enChair.aspx?ID=84| accessdate=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= "Get It Louder" Exhibition Blasts Beijing and Shanghai with Contemporary Art |url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/35868/get-it-louder-exhibition-blasts-beijing-and-shanghai-with-contemporary-art| accessdate=September 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Get It Louder: China's Most Influential and {{sic|hide=y|Closely|-}}Watched Exhibition of Emerging, Young Talent|url=http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=41009| accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview about the exhibition, Ou discussed sharism at length and described it as an "Internet concept" that explores the increasingly convoluted relationship between public and private realms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Ou Ning on Get it Louder – new voice in China’s visual arts scene| url=http://artradarjournal.com/2010/12/22/ou-ning-on-get-it-louder-new-voice-in-chinas-visual-arts-scene/| accessdate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharism Lab was created in 2012 with the purpose of providing experimental and theoretical background for a [[reality|real-world]] implementation of sharism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sharismlab.com/ Sharism Lab] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529221341/http://sharismlab.com/ |date=May 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events and by-products ==
{{verify source|date=April 2014}}

Several types of sharism events have been created for people to meet and share things they like or things they make. Sharism Forum was held in October 2010 at the Get It Louder festival in Shanghai, and gathered international speakers, practitioners and activists to discuss the idea of sharism. 

Another event called "Sharism Presents" offers an informal setup for people to share whatever they want with the attending audience. Since 2010, Sharism Presents have been hosted in many cities throughout the world, included: Amsterdam, Shanghai, Beijing, Madrid, Barcelona, Brussels, Berlin, Montreal, Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul.

Sharism Workshops provide a framework for collective production through the act of sharing. Workshops have been held in Beijing, Doha and Warsaw and have included musicians, digital artists, and designers.

In order to offer an easy way to share any kind of work online, the Sharing Agreement has been created in order to work around the increasing complexity of [[licenses]].

== Criticism ==
Many academics point to the downsides of such uncritical belief in the transformative power of technology. User generated content has been reframed as "Loser Generated Content", as the value of this sharing often ends up with companies, and not in the [[public domain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2141/1948 Loser Generated Content: from participation to exploitation]&lt;/ref&gt;
Within the art world, it has been suggested that there are "dangers of 'sharism", which "lead people to believe that whatever is contemporary must also be avantgarde."&lt;ref&gt;[http://leapleapleap.com/2012/05/interpreting-theory-two-models-for-importation/ Interpreting Theory: Two Models For Importation]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soil''' is a [[mixture]] of [[organic matter]], [[minerals]], [[gas]]es, [[liquid]]s, and [[organism]]s that together support [[life]]. [[Earth]]'s body of soil is the [[pedosphere]], which has four important functions: it is a medium for plant growth; it is a means of [[water storage]], supply and purification; it is a modifier of [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]; it is a habitat for organisms; all of which, in turn, modify the soil.

The pedosphere interfaces with the [[lithosphere]], the [[hydrosphere]], the [[atmosphere]], and the [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chesworth |first=Ward |date=2008 |title=Encyclopedia of soil science |isbn=978-1402039942 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |location=Dordrecht, The Netherlands |nopp=true |url=http://data.lib.hutech.edu.vn/mucluc/f2e0a00788a82be82718e64d734d1a50.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''pedolith'', used commonly to refer to the soil, translates to ''ground stone''. Soil consists of a solid phase of minerals and organic matter (the soil matrix), as well as a [[Porosity|porous]] phase that holds gases (the soil atmosphere) and water (the soil solution).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Voroney |first1=R.

Soil is a major component of the [[Earth]]'s [[ecosystem]]. The world's ecosystems are impacted in far-reaching ways by the processes carried out in the soil, from [[ozone depletion]] and [[global warming]] to [[rainforest destruction]] and [[water pollution]]. With respect to Earth's [[carbon cycle]], soil is an important [[carbon sink|carbon reservoir]], and it is potentially one of the most reactive to human disturbance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pouyat |first1=Richard |last2=Groffman |first2=Peter |last3=Yesilonis |first3=Ian |last4=Hernandez |first4=Luis |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Environmental Pollution (journal)|Environmental Pollution]] |volume=116 |issue=Supplement 1 |title=Soil carbon pools and fluxes in urban ecosystems |url=https://www.ncrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/jrnl/2002/ne_2002_Pouyat_001.pdf |year=2002 |pages=S107–S118 |doi=10.1016/S0269-7491(01)00263-9 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and climate change.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davidson |first1=Eric A. |last2=Janssens |first2=Ivan A. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=440 |title=Temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition and feedbacks to climate change |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7253750 |year=2006 |issue=9 March 2006 |pages=165‒73 |doi=10.1038/nature04514 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |pmid=16525463|bibcode=2006Natur.440..165D }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the planet warms, it has been predicted that soils will add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere due to increased [[Soil biology|biological]] activity at higher temperatures, a [[positive feedback]] (amplification).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Powlson |first=David |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=433 |title=Climatology: will soil amplify climate change? |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/433204a.pdf |year=2005 |issue=20 January 2005 |pages=204‒05 |doi=10.1038/433204a |pmid=15662396 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2005Natur.433..204P }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prediction has, however, been questioned on consideration of more recent knowledge on soil carbon turnover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bradford |first1=Mark A. |last2=Wieder |first2=William R. |last3=Bonan |first3=Gordon B. |last4=Fierer |first4=Noah |last5=Raymond |first5=Peter A. |last6=Crowther |first6=Thomas W. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Nature Climate Change]] |volume=6 |title=Managing uncertainty in soil carbon feedbacks to climate change |url=http://fiererlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Bradford_etal_2016_NCC.pdf |year=2016 |issue=27 July 2016 |pages=751–58 |doi=10.1038/nclimate3071 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2016NatCC...6..751B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical soil is about 50% solids (45% mineral and 5% organic matter), and 50% voids (or pores) of which half is occupied by water and half by gas.&lt;ref name="McClellan2017"&gt;{{cite web |last=McClellan |first=Tai |title=Soil composition |url=https://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/mauisoil/a_comp.aspx |publisher=University of Hawai‘i – College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources |accessdate=29 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The percent soil mineral and organic content can be treated as a constant (in the short term), while the percent soil water and gas content is considered highly variable whereby a rise in one is simultaneously balanced by a reduction in the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Arizona Master Gardener Manual |url=http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/garden/mg/soils/soils.html |publisher=Cooperative Extension, College of Agriculture, University of Arizona |accessdate=17 December 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529015259/http://ag.arizona.edu/pubs/garden/mg/soils/soils.html |archivedate=29 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pore space allows for the infiltration and movement of air and water, both of which are critical for life existing in soil.&lt;ref name="Vannier1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vannier |first=Guy |journal=Biology and Fertility of Soils |volume=3 |issue=1 |title=The porosphere as an ecological medium emphasized in Professor Ghilarov's work on soil animal adaptations |year=1987 |url=https://eurekamag.com/pdf/001/001713676.pdf |pages=39–44 |doi=10.1007/BF00260577 |accessdate=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compaction, a common problem with soils, reduces this space, preventing air and water from reaching plant roots and soil organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Torbert |first1=H.

Given sufficient time, an undifferentiated soil will evolve a [[soil horizon|soil profile]] which consists of two or more layers, referred to as [[soil horizon]]s, that differ in one or more properties such as in their texture, structure, density, porosity, consistency, temperature, color, and reactivity.&lt;ref name="Buol"/&gt; The horizons differ greatly in thickness and generally lack sharp boundaries; their development is dependent on the type of [[parent material]], the processes that modify those parent materials, and the [[Soil#soil-forming factors|soil-forming factors]] that influence those processes. The biological influences on soil properties are strongest near the surface, while the geochemical influences on soil properties increase with depth. Mature soil profiles typically include three basic master horizons: A, B, and C. The [[solum]] normally includes the A and B horizons. The living component of the soil is largely confined to the solum, and is generally more prominent in the A horizon.{{sfn|Simonson|1957|p=17}}

The [[soil texture]] is determined by the relative proportions of the individual particles of sand, silt, and clay that make up the soil. The interaction of the individual mineral particles with organic matter, water, gases via [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] processes causes those particles to [[flocculate]] (stick together) to form [[soil structure|aggregates]] or [[ped]]s.&lt;ref name="Bronick2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bronick |first1=Carol J. |last2=Lal |first2=Ratan |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Soil structure and management: a review |journal=Geoderma |date=January 2005 |volume=124 |issue=1/2 |pages=3–22 |doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2004.03.005 |url=http://tinread.usarb.md:8888/tinread/fulltext/lal/soil_structure.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2005Geode.124....3B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Where these aggregates can be identified, a soil can be said to be developed, and can be described further in terms of color, [[porosity]], [[consistency]], reaction ([[acidity]]), etc.

Water is a critical agent in soil development due to its involvement in the dissolution, precipitation, erosion, transport, and deposition of the materials of which a soil is composed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/r4082e/r4082e03.htm |title=Soil and water |website=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixture of water and dissolved or suspended materials that occupy the soil [[pore space]] is called the soil solution. Since [[soil water]] is never pure water, but contains hundreds of dissolved organic and mineral substances, it may be more accurately called the soil solution. Water is central to the [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]], [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] and [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] of minerals from the [[soil profile]]. Finally, water affects the type of vegetation that grows in a soil, which in turn affects the development of the soil, a complex feedback which is exemplified in the dynamics of banded vegetation patterns in semi-arid regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Valentin |first1=Christian |last2=d'Herbès |first2=Jean-Marc |last3=Poesen |first3=Jean |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Catena |volume=37 |issue=1 |title=Soil and water components of banded vegetation patterns |year=1999 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248379223 |pages=1‒24 |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(99)00053-3 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soils supply plants with nutrients, most of which are held in place by particles of [[Soil texture#Soil separates|clay]] and [[Soil organic matter|organic matter]] ([[colloid]]s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barber |first=Stanley A. |date=1995 |chapter=Chemistry of soil-nutrient associations |title=Soil nutrient bioavailability: a mechanistic approach |pages=9–48 |edition=2nd |editor-last=Barber |editor-first=Stanley A. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0471587477}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nutrients may be [[Adsorption|adsorbed]] on clay mineral surfaces, bound within clay minerals ([[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]]), or bound within organic compounds as part of the living [[Soil organism|organisms]] or dead [[soil organic matter]]. These bound nutrients interact with soil water to buffer the soil solution composition (attenuate changes in the soil solution) as soils wet up or dry out, as plants take up nutrients, as salts are leached, or as acids or alkalis are added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eagri.org/eagri50/SSAC121/lec14.pdf |title=Soil colloids: properties, nature, types and significance |website=[[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CEC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soilminerals.com/Cation_Exchange_Simplified.htm |title=Cation exchange capacity in soils, simplified |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant nutrient availability is affected by [[soil pH]], which is a measure of the hydrogen ion activity in the soil solution. Soil pH is a function of many soil forming factors, and is generally lower (more acid) where weathering is more advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/18519/FS-1054%20Soil%20pH%20and%20Nutrient%20Availbility.pdf |last=Miller |first=Jarrod O. |title=Soil pH affects nutrient availability |website=[[University of Maryland]] |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most plant nutrients, with the exception of nitrogen, originate from the [[mineral]]s that make up the soil parent material. Some nitrogen originates from rain as dilute [[nitric acid]] and [[ammonia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goulding |first1=Keith W.T. |last2=Bailey |first2=Neal J. |last3=Bradbury |first3=Nicola J. |last4=Hargreaves |first4=Patrick |last5=Howe |first5=MT |last6=Murphy |first6=Daniel V. |last7=Poulton |first7=Paul R. |last8=Willison |first8=Toby W. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=139 |issue=1 |title=Nitrogen deposition and its contribution to nitrogen cycling and associated soil processes |year=1998 |pages=49‒58 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00182.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; but most of the nitrogen is available in soils as a result of [[nitrogen fixation]] by bacteria. Once in the soil-plant system, most nutrients are recycled through living organisms, plant and microbial residues ([[soil organic matter]]), mineral-bound forms, and the soil solution. Both living [[Soil microbe|microorganisms]] and [[soil organic matter]] are of critical importance to this recycling, and thereby to soil formation and soil fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kononova |first=M.

==History of studies==

===Fertility===
The history of the study of soil is intimately tied to humans' urgent need to provide food for themselves and forage for our animals.

The Greek historian [[Xenophon]] (450–355 BCE) is credited with being the first to expound upon the merits of green-manuring crops: "But then whatever weeds are upon the ground, being turned into earth, enrich the soil as much as dung."{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=4}}

[[Columella]]'s "Husbandry," circa 60 CE, advocated the use of lime and that [[clover]] and [[alfalfa]] ([[green manure]]) should be turned under, and was used by 15 generations (450 years) under the [[Roman Empire]] until its collapse.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=4}}{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=1}} From the [[fall of Rome]] to the [[French Revolution]], knowledge of soil and agriculture was passed on from parent to child and as a result, crop yields were low.

Experiments into what made plants grow first led to the idea that the ash left behind when plant matter was burned was the essential element but overlooked the role of nitrogen, which is not left on the ground after combustion, a belief which prevailed until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van der Ploeg |first1=Rienk R. |last2=Schweigert |first2=Peter |last3=Bachmann |first3=Joerg |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Scientific World Journal]] |volume=1 |issue=S2 |title=Use and misuse of nitrogen in agriculture: the German story |url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2001/683180/abs/ |year=2001 |pages=737–44 |doi=10.1100/tsw.2001.263 |pmid=12805882 |pmc=6084271 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In about 1635, the Flemish chemist [[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] thought he had proved water to be the essential element from his famous five years' experiment with a willow tree grown with only the addition of rainwater. His conclusion came from the fact that the increase in the plant's weight had apparently been produced only by the addition of water, with no reduction in the soil's weight.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=3}} [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]] (d. 1728) experimented with various types of water ranging from clean to muddy and found muddy water the best, and so he concluded that earthy matter was the essential element. Others concluded it was humus in the soil that passed some essence to the growing plant. Still others held that the vital growth principal was something passed from dead plants or animals to the new plants. At the start of the 18th century, [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]] demonstrated that it was beneficial to cultivate (stir) the soil, but his opinion that the stirring made the fine parts of soil available for plant absorption was erroneous.&lt;ref name="Brady"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brady |first=Nyle C. |title=The nature and properties of soils |edition=9th |year=1984 |publisher=[[Collier Macmillan]] |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0023133404}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=2}}

As chemistry developed, it was applied to the investigation of [[soil fertility]]. The French chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] showed in about 1778 that plants and animals must [combust] oxygen internally to live and was able to deduce that most of the 165-pound weight of [[Jan Baptist van Helmont|van Helmont]]'s willow tree derived from air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |language=fr |last=de Lavoisier |first=Antoine-Laurent |journal=Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences |title=Mémoire sur la combustion en général |year=1777 |url=http://www.academie-sciences.fr/pdf/dossiers/Franklin/Franklin_pdf/Mem1777_p592.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the French agriculturalist [[Jean-Baptiste Boussingault]] who by means of experimentation obtained evidence showing that the main sources of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen for plants were air and water, while nitrogen was taken from soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=fr |last=Boussingault |first=Jean-Baptiste |title=Agronomie, chimie agricole et physiologie, volumes 1-5 |year=1860–1874 |publisher=Mallet-Bachelier |location=Paris, France |url=https://archive.org/details/8TSUP364_1 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Justus von Liebig]] in his book ''Organic chemistry in its applications to agriculture and physiology'' (published 1840), asserted that the chemicals in plants must have come from the soil and air and that to maintain soil fertility, the used minerals must be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=von Liebig |first=Justus |title=Organic chemistry in its applications to agriculture and physiology |year=1840 |publisher=Taylor and Walton |location=London, United Kingdom |url=https://archive.org/details/organicchemistry00liebrich |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liebig nevertheless believed the nitrogen was supplied from the air. The enrichment of soil with guano by the Incas was rediscovered in 1802, by [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. This led to its mining and that of Chilean nitrate and to its application to soil in the United States and Europe after 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Way |first=J. Thomas |journal=Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England |title=On the composition and money value of the different varieties of guano |year=1849 |volume=10 |pages=196–230 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/37078#page/220/mode/1up |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Liebig was a revolution for agriculture, and so other investigators started experimentation based on it. In England [[John Bennet Lawes]] and [[Joseph Henry Gilbert]] worked in the [[Rothamsted Research|Rothamsted Experimental Station]], founded by the former, and (re)discovered that plants took nitrogen from the soil, and that salts needed to be in an available state to be absorbed by plants. Their investigations also produced the "[[superphosphate]]", consisting in the acid treatment of phosphate rock.{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=4}} This led to the invention and use of salts of potassium (K) and nitrogen (N) as fertilizers. Ammonia generated by the production of [[coke (fuel)|coke]] was recovered and used as fertiliser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tandon |first=Hari L.S. |url=http://www.tandontech.net/fertilisers.html |title=A short history of fertilisers |website=Fertiliser Development and Consultation Organisation |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the chemical basis of nutrients delivered to the soil in manure was understood and in the mid-19th century chemical fertilisers were applied. However, the dynamic interaction of soil and its life forms still awaited discovery.

In 1856 J. Thomas Way discovered that ammonia contained in fertilisers was transformed into nitrates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Way |first=J.

It was known that certain [[legume]]s could take up nitrogen from the air and fix it to the soil but it took the development of bacteriology towards the end of the 19th century to lead to an understanding of the role played in [[nitrogen fixation]] by bacteria. The symbiosis of bacteria and leguminous roots, and the fixation of nitrogen by the bacteria, were simultaneously discovered by the German agronomist [[Hermann Hellriegel]] and the Dutch microbiologist [[Martinus Beijerinck]].{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|p=4}}

[[Crop rotation]], mechanisation, chemical and natural fertilisers led to a doubling of wheat yields in western Europe between 1800 and 1900.{{sfn|Kellogg|1957|pp=1–4}}

===Formation===
The scientists who studied the soil in connection with agricultural practices had considered it mainly as a static substrate. However, soil is the result of evolution from more ancient geological materials, under the action of [[Life|biotic]] and abiotic (not associated with life) processes. After studies of the improvement of the soil commenced, others began to study soil genesis and as a result also soil types and classifications.

In 1860, in Mississippi, [[Eugene W. Hilgard]] studied the relationship among rock material, climate, and vegetation, and the type of soils that were developed. He realised that the soils were dynamic, and considered soil types classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hilgard |first=Eugene W. |title=Soils: their formation, properties, composition, and relations to climate and plant growth in the humid and arid regions |year=1921 |publisher=[[The Macmillan Company]] |location=London, United Kingdom |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/65783 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately his work was not continued. At the same time [[Vasily Dokuchaev]] (about 1870) was leading a team of soil scientists in Russia who conducted an extensive survey of soils, finding that similar basic rocks, climate and vegetation types lead to similar soil layering and types, and established the concepts for soil classifications. Due to language barriers, the work of this team was not communicated to western Europe until 1914 through a publication in German by [[Konstantin Glinka|Konstantin Dmitrievich Glinka]], a member of the Russian team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |language=ge |last=Glinka |first=Konstantin Dmitrievich |title=Die Typen der Bodenbildung: ihre Klassifikation und geographische Verbreitung |year=1914 |publisher=[[Borntraeger]] |location=Berlin, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Curtis F. Marbut]] was influenced by the work of the Russian team, translated Glinka's publication into English,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glinka |first=Konstantin Dmitrievich |title=The great soil groups of the world and their development |year=1927 |publisher=Edwards Brothers |location=Ann Arbor, Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as he was placed in charge of the U. S. [[National Cooperative Soil Survey]], applied it to a national soil classification system.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;

==Formation==
Soil formation, or [[pedogenesis]], is the combined effect of physical, chemical, biological and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] processes working on soil parent material. Soil is said to be formed when organic matter has accumulated and [[colloid]]s are washed downward, leaving deposits of clay, humus, iron oxide, carbonate, and gypsum, producing a distinct layer called the B horizon. This is a somewhat arbitrary definition as mixtures of sand, silt, clay and humus will support biological and agricultural activity before that time. These constituents are moved from one level to another by water and animal activity. As a result, layers (horizons) form in the soil profile. The alteration and movement of materials within a soil causes the formation of distinctive [[soil horizons]]. However, more recent definitions of soil embrace soils without any organic matter, such as those [[regolith]]s that formed on Mars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bishop |first1=Janice L. |last2=Murchie |first2=Scott L. |last3=Pieters |first3=Carlé L. |last4=Zent |first4=Aaron P. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2002 |title=A model for formation of dust, soil, and rock coatings on Mars: physical and chemical processes on the Martian surface |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]] |volume=107 |issue=E11 |pages=1–17 |doi=10.1029/2001JE001581 |bibcode=2002JGRE..107.5097B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and analogous conditions in planet Earth deserts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Navarro-González |first1=Rafael |last2=Rainey |first2=Fred A. |last3=Molina |first3=Paola |last4=Bagaley |first4=Danielle R. |last5=Hollen |first5=Becky J. |last6=de la Rosa |first6=José |last7=Small |first7=Alanna M. |last8=Quinn |first8=Richard C. |last9=Grunthaner |first9=Frank J. |last10=Cáceres |first10=Luis |last11=Gomez-Silva |first11=Benito |last12=McKay |first12=Christopher P. |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2003 |title=Mars-like soils in the Atacama desert, Chile, and the dry limit of microbial life |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=302 |issue=5647 |pages=1018–21 |doi=10.1126/science.1089143 |pmid=14605363 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9020258 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2003Sci...302.1018N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the development of a soil would begin with the weathering of lava flow bedrock, which would produce the purely mineral-based parent material from which the soil texture forms. Soil development would proceed most rapidly from bare rock of recent flows in a warm climate, under heavy and frequent rainfall. Under such conditions, plants (in a first stage [[nitrogen-fixing]] [[lichens]] and [[cyanobacteria]] then [[epilithic]] [[higher plants]]) become established very quickly on [[basalt]]ic lava, even though there is very little organic material. The plants are supported by the porous rock as it is filled with [[nutrient]]-bearing water that carries minerals dissolved from the rocks. Crevasses and pockets, local topography of the rocks, would hold fine materials and harbour plant roots. The developing plant roots are associated with mineral-[[weathering]] [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizal fungi]]&lt;ref name="Van Schöll2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van Schöll |first1=Laura |last2=Smits |first2=Mark M. |last3=Hoffland |first3=Ellis  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2006 |title=Ectomycorrhizal weathering of the soil minerals muscovite and hornblende |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=171 |issue=4 |pages=805–14 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01790.x |pmid=16918551 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that assist in breaking up the porous lava, and by these means organic matter and a finer mineral soil accumulate with time.

===Factors===

How soil formation proceeds is influenced by at least five classic factors that are intertwined in the evolution of a soil. They are: parent material, climate, topography (relief), organisms, and time.&lt;ref name="Jenny1941"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenny |first=Hans |title=Factors of soil formation: a system of qunatitative pedology |year=1941 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York, New York |url=http://netedu.xauat.edu.cn/sykc/hjx/content/ckzl/6/2.pdf |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When reordered to climate, relief, organisms, parent material, and time, they form the acronym CROPT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthonlinemedia.com/ebooks/tpe_3e/title_page.html |title=The physical environment: an introduction to physical geography |first=Michael E. |last=Ritter |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parent material====
The mineral material from which a soil forms is called [[parent material]]. Rock, whether its origin is igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic, is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon. As the parent material is chemically and physically weathered, transported, deposited and precipitated, it is transformed into a soil.

Typical soil parent mineral materials are:{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=20–21}}
* [[Quartz]]: SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Calcite]]: CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Feldspar]]: KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;
* [[Mica]] (biotite): K(Mg,Fe)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

[[File:Lössacker.jpg|thumb|Soil, on an agricultural field in Germany, which has formed on [[loess]] parent material.]]
Parent materials are classified according to how they came to be deposited. Residual materials are mineral materials that have weathered in place from primary [[bedrock]]. Transported materials are those that have been deposited by water, wind, ice or gravity. Cumulose material is organic matter that has grown and accumulates in place.

Residual soils are soils that develop from their underlying parent rocks and have the same general chemistry as those rocks. The soils found on mesas, plateaux, and plains are residual soils. In the United States as little as three percent of the soils are residual.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=21}}

Most soils derive from transported materials that have been moved many miles by wind, water, ice and gravity.
* [[Aeolian processes]] (movement by wind) are capable of moving silt and fine sand many hundreds of miles, forming [[loess]] soils (60–90 percent silt),{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=24}} common in the Midwest of North America, north-western Europe, Argentina and Central Asia. Clay is seldom moved by wind as it forms stable aggregates.
* Water-transported materials are classed as either alluvial, lacustrine, or marine. [[Alluvium|Alluvial materials]] are those moved and deposited by flowing water. [[Sediment|Sedimentary deposits]] settled in lakes are called [[Lacustrine plain|lacustrine]]. [[Lake Bonneville]] and many soils around the Great Lakes of the United States are examples. Marine deposits, such as soils along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and in the [[Imperial Valley]] of California of the United States, are the beds of ancient seas that have been revealed as the land uplifted.
* Ice moves parent material and makes deposits in the form of terminal and lateral [[moraine]]s in the case of stationary glaciers. Retreating glaciers leave smoother ground moraines and in all cases, outwash plains are left as alluvial deposits are moved downstream from the glacier.
* Parent material moved by gravity is obvious at the base of steep slopes as [[Scree|talus cones]] and is called [[colluvial material]].

Cumulose parent material is not moved but originates from deposited organic material. This includes [[peat]] and [[Muck (soil)|muck soils]] and results from preservation of plant residues by the low oxygen content of a high water table. While peat may form sterile soils, muck soils may be very fertile.

=====Weathering=====
The [[weathering]] of parent material takes the form of physical weathering (disintegration), chemical weathering (decomposition) and chemical transformation. Generally, minerals that are formed under high temperatures and pressures at great depths within the [[Earth's mantle]] are less resistant to weathering, while minerals formed at low temperature and pressure environment of the surface are more resistant to weathering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} Weathering is usually confined to the top few meters of geologic material, because physical, chemical, and biological stresses and fluctuations generally decrease with depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uregina.ca/~sauchyn/geog323/weather.html |title=Weathering |website=University of Regina |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical disintegration begins as rocks that have solidified deep in the Earth are exposed to lower pressure near the surface and swell and become mechanically unstable. Chemical decomposition is a function of mineral solubility, the rate of which doubles with each 10&amp;nbsp;°C rise in temperature, but is strongly dependent on water to effect chemical changes. Rocks that will decompose in a few years in tropical climates will remain unaltered for millennia in deserts.&lt;ref name="Gilluly1975"/&gt; Structural changes are the result of hydration, oxidation, and reduction. Chemical weathering mainly results from the excretion of [[organic acids]] and [[chelating]] compounds by bacteria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Uroz |first1=Stéphane |last2=Calvaruso |first2=Christophe |last3=Turpault |first3=Marie-Pierre |last4=Frey-Klett |first4=Pascale |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2009 |title=Mineral weathering by bacteria: ecology, actors and mechanisms |journal=[[Trends in Microbiology]] |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=378–87 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X09001279 |subscription=yes |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2009.05.004 |pmid=19660952 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fungi,&lt;ref name="Landeweert2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Landeweert |first1=Renske |last2=Hoffland |first2=Ellis |last3=Finlay |first3=Roger D. |last4=Kuyper |first4=Thom W. |last5=Van Breemen |first5=Nico |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001 |title=Linking plants to rocks: ectomycorrhizal fungi mobilize nutrients from minerals |journal=[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=248–54 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016953470102122X |subscription=yes |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02122-X |pmid=11301154 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; thought to increase under present-day [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andrews |first1=Jeffrey A. |last2=Schlesinger |first2=William H. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001 |title=Soil CO2 dynamics, acidification, and chemical weathering in a temperate forest with experimental CO2 enrichment |journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=149–62 |doi=10.1029/2000GB001278 |bibcode=2001GBioC..15..149A }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Physical disintegration''' is the first stage in the transformation of parent material into soil. Temperature fluctuations cause expansion and contraction of the rock, splitting it along lines of weakness. Water may then enter the cracks and freeze and cause the physical splitting of material along a path toward the center of the rock, while temperature gradients within the rock can cause exfoliation of "shells". Cycles of wetting and drying cause soil particles to be abraded to a finer size, as does the physical rubbing of material as it is moved by wind, water, and gravity. Water can deposit within rocks minerals that expand upon drying, thereby stressing the rock. Finally, organisms reduce parent material in size and create crevices and pores through the mechanical action of plant roots and the digging activity of animals.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=28–31}} Grinding of parent material by rock-eating animals also contributes to incipient soil formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jones |first1=Clive G. |last2=Shachak |first2=Moshe |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1990 |title=Fertilization of the desert soil by rock-eating snails |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=346 |issue=6287 |pages=839–41 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242874418 |doi=10.1038/346839a0 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=1990Natur.346..839J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saprolite]] is a particular example of a residual soil formed from the transformation of granite, metamorphic and other types of bedrock into clay minerals. Often called [weathered granite], saprolite is the result of weathering processes that include: [[hydrolysis]], [[chelation]] from organic compounds, [[hydration reaction|hydration]] (the solution of minerals in water with resulting cation and anion pairs) and physical processes that include [[freezing]] and [[thawing]]. The mineralogical and chemical composition of the primary [[bedrock]] material, its physical features, including grain size and degree of consolidation, and the rate and type of weathering transforms the parent material into a different mineral. The texture, pH and mineral constituents of saprolite are inherited from its parent material. This process is also called ''arenization'', resulting in the formation of sandy soils (granitic arenas), thanks to the much higher resistance of quartz compared to other mineral components of granite ([[micas]],  [[amphiboles]], [[feldspars]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sequeira Braga |first1=Maria Amália |last2=Paquet |first2=Hélène |last3=Begonha |first3=Arlindo |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002 |title=Weathering of granites in a temperate climate (NW Portugal): granitic saprolites and arenization |journal=Catena |volume=49 |issue=1/2 |pages=41–56 |url=http://home.uevora.pt/~lopes/Artigos/23.PDF |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(02)00017-6 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Climate====
The principal climatic variables influencing soil formation are effective [[precipitation]] (i.e., precipitation minus [[evapotranspiration]]) and temperature, both of which affect the rates of chemical, physical, and biological processes. Temperature and moisture both influence the organic matter content of soil through their effects on the balance between [[primary production]] and [[decomposition]]: the colder or drier the climate the lesser atmospheric carbon is fixed as organic matter while the lesser organic matter is decomposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Epstein |first1=Howard E. |last2=Burke |first2=Ingrid C. |last3=Lauenroth |first3=William K. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002 |title=Regional patterns of decomposition and primary production rates in the U.S. Great Plains |journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=320–27 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233379719 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2002)083[0320:RPODAP]2.0.CO;2 |accessdate=17 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate is the dominant factor in [[soil formation]], and soils show the distinctive characteristics of the [[climate zone]]s in which they form, with a feedback to climate through transfer of carbon stocked in soil horizons back to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Davidson"/&gt; If warm temperatures and abundant water are present in the profile at the same time, the processes of [[weathering]], [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], and plant growth will be maximized. According to the climatic determination of [[biomes]], humid climates favor the growth of trees. In contrast, grasses are the dominant native vegetation in subhumid and [[semiarid]] regions, while shrubs and brush of various kinds dominate in arid areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Woodward |first1=F.

Water is essential for all the major chemical weathering reactions. To be effective in soil formation, water must penetrate the [[regolith]]. The seasonal rainfall distribution, evaporative losses, site [[topography]], and [[soil permeability]] interact to determine how effectively precipitation can influence soil formation. The greater the depth of water penetration, the greater the depth of weathering of the soil and its development.

====Topography====
The [[topography]], or [[relief]], is characterized by the inclination ([[slope]]), [[elevation]], and orientation of the terrain. Topography determines the rate of precipitation or [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and rate of formation or erosion of the surface [[soil profile]]. The topographical setting may either hasten or retard the work of climatic forces.

Steep slopes encourage rapid soil loss by [[erosion]] and allow less rainfall to enter the soil before running off and hence, little mineral deposition in lower profiles. In semiarid regions, the lower effective rainfall on steeper slopes also results in less complete vegetative cover, so there is less plant contribution to soil formation. For all of these reasons, steep slopes prevent the formation of soil from getting very far ahead of soil destruction. Therefore, soils on steep terrain tend to have rather shallow, poorly developed profiles in comparison to soils on nearby, more level sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Baoyuan |last2=Nearing |first2=Mark A. |last3=Risse |first3=L.

In [[swales]] and depressions where runoff water tends to concentrate, the regolith is usually more deeply weathered and soil profile development is more advanced. However, in the lowest landscape positions, water may saturate the regolith to such a degree that drainage and aeration are restricted. Here, the weathering of some minerals and the decomposition of organic matter are retarded, while the loss of iron and manganese is accelerated. In such low-lying topography, special profile features characteristic of [[wetland]] soils may develop. Depressions allow the accumulation of water, minerals and organic matter and in the extreme, the resulting soils will be [[saline marsh]]es or [[peat bog]]s.

Sand is the most stable of the mineral components of soil; it consists of rock fragments, primarily [[quartz]] particles, ranging in size from {{convert|2.0|to|0.05|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. Silt ranges in size from {{convert|0.05|to|0.002|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Clay cannot be resolved by optical microscopes as its particles are {{convert|0.002|mm|in|abbr=on}} or less in diameter and a thickness of only 10 [[angstroms]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; m).{{sfn|Russell|1957|pp=32–33}}{{sfn|Flemming|1957|p=331}} In medium-textured soils, clay is often washed downward through the soil profile (a process called [[eluviation]]) and accumulates in the subsoil (a process called [[illuviation]]). There is no clear relationship between the size of soil mineral components and their mineralogical nature: sand and silt particles can be [[calcareous]] as well as [[siliceous]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/coast/sand/calcsand.html |title=Calcareous Sand |website=[[U.S. Geological Survey]] |accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while textural clay ({{convert|0.002|mm|in|abbr=on}}) can be made of very fine quartz particles as well as of multi-layered secondary minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grim |first=Ralph E. |date=1953 |title=Clay mineralogy |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York, NY |url=http://krishikosh.egranth.ac.in/bitstream/1/2037422/1/1334.pdf |accessdate=24 December 2017 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil mineral components belonging to a given textural class may thus share properties linked to their [[specific surface area]] (e.g. [[moisture retention]]) but not those linked to their chemical composition (e.g. [[cation exchange capacity]]).

Soil components larger than {{convert|2.0|mm|in|abbr=on}} are classed as rock and gravel and are removed before determining the percentages of the remaining components and the textural class of the soil, but are included in the name. For example, a sandy [[loam]] soil with 20% gravel would be called gravelly sandy loam.

When the organic component of a soil is substantial, the soil is called organic soil rather than mineral soil. A soil is called organic if:

# Mineral fraction is 0% clay and organic matter is 20% or more
# Mineral fraction is 0% to 50% clay and organic matter is between 20% and 30%
# Mineral fraction is 50% or more clay and organic matter 30% or more.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=53}}

The clumping of the soil textural components of sand, silt and clay causes [[Aggregate (geology)|aggregates]] to form and the further association of those aggregates into larger units creates [[soil structure]]s called peds (a contraction of the word [[pedolith]]).

Soil structure often gives clues to its texture, organic matter content, biological activity, past soil evolution, human use, and the chemical and mineralogical conditions under which the soil formed. While texture is defined by the mineral component of a soil and is an innate property of the soil that does not change with agricultural activities, soil structure can be improved or destroyed by the choice and timing of farming practices.&lt;ref name="Bronick2005"/&gt;

Soil structural classes:{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=55–56}}

# Types: '''Shape''' and arrangement of peds
## Platy: Peds are flattened one atop the other 1–10&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Found in the A-horizon of forest soils and lake sedimentation.
## Prismatic and Columnar: Prismlike peds are long in the vertical dimension, 10–100&amp;nbsp;mm wide. Prismatic peds have flat tops, columnar peds have rounded tops. Tend to form in the B-horizon in high sodium soil where clay has accumulated.
## Angular and subangular: Blocky peds are imperfect cubes, 5–50&amp;nbsp;mm, angular have sharp edges, subangular have rounded edges. Tend to form in the B-horizon where clay has accumulated and indicate poor water penetration.
## Granular and Crumb: Spheroid peds of polyhedrons, 1–10&amp;nbsp;mm, often found in the A-horizon in the presence of organic material. Crumb peds are more porous and are considered ideal.
# Classes: '''Size''' of peds whose ranges depend upon the above type
## Very fine or very thin: &lt;1&amp;nbsp;mm platy and spherical; &lt;5&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; &lt;10&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
## Fine or thin: 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm platy, and spherical; 5–10&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
## Medium: 2–5&amp;nbsp;mm platy, granular; 10–20&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; 20–50 prismlike.
## Coarse or thick: 5–10&amp;nbsp;mm platy, granular; 20–50&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; 50–100&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
## Very coarse or very thick: &gt;10&amp;nbsp;mm platy, granular; &gt;50&amp;nbsp;mm blocky; &gt;100&amp;nbsp;mm prismlike.
# Grades: Is a measure of the degree of '''development''' or cementation within the peds that results in their strength and stability.
## Weak: Weak cementation allows peds to fall apart into the three textural constituents, sand, silt and clay.
## Moderate: Peds are not distinct in undisturbed soil but when removed they break into aggregates, some broken aggregates and little unaggregated material. This is considered ideal.
## Strong:Peds are distinct before removed from the profile and do not break apart easily.
## Structureless: Soil is entirely cemented together in one great mass such as slabs of clay or no cementation at all such as with sand.

At the largest scale, the forces that shape a soil's structure result from [[Shrink–swell capacity|swelling and shrinkage]] that initially tend to act horizontally, causing vertically oriented prismatic peds. This mechanical process is mainly exemplified in the development of [[vertisols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dinka |first1=Takele M. |last2=Morgan |first2=Cristine L.S. |last3=McInnes |first3=Kevin J. |last4=Kishné |first4= Andrea Sz. |last5=Harmel |first5=R.

===Consistency===
Consistency is the ability of soil to stick to itself or to other objects ([[Cohesion (geology)|cohesion]] and [[adhesion]], respectively) and its ability to resist deformation and rupture. It is of approximate use in predicting cultivation problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boekel |first1=P. |last2=Peerlkamp |first2=Petrus K. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Netherlands Journal of Agricultural Science |volume=4 |issue=1 |title=Soil consistency as a factor determining the soil structure of clay soils |url=http://edepot.wur.nl/211680 |year=1956 |pages=122–25 |accessdate=7 January 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the engineering of foundations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Day |first=Robert W. |date=2000 |chapter=Soil mechanics and foundations |title=Building design and construction handbook |edition=6th |editor1-first=Frederick S. |editor1-last=Merritt |editor2-first=Jonathan T. |editor2-last=Rickett |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Professional]] |location=New York, New York, USA |isbn=978-0070419995 |url=http://my.fit.edu/~locurcio/14-Civil%20&amp;%20Const%20handbooks/McGraw%20Hill%20-%20Design%20&amp;%20Const%20Handbook/06-Soils%20&amp;%20Foundations.pdf |accessdate=7 January 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistency is measured at three moisture conditions: air-dry, moist, and wet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/docs/CDrom/FAO_Training/FAO_Training/General/x6706e/x6706e08.htm |title=Soil consistency |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |location=Rome, Italy |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those conditions the consistency quality depends upon the clay content. In the wet state, the two qualities of stickiness and plasticity are assessed. A soil's resistance to fragmentation and crumbling is assessed in the dry state by rubbing the sample. Its resistance to shearing forces is assessed in the moist state by thumb and finger pressure. Additionally, the cemented consistency depends on cementation by substances other than clay, such as calcium carbonate, silica, oxides and salts; moisture content has little effect on its assessment. The measures of consistency border on subjective compared to other measures such as pH, since they employ the apparent feel of the soil in those states.

The terms used to describe the soil consistency in three moisture states and a last not affected by the amount of moisture are as follows:

# Consistency of Dry Soil: loose, soft, slightly hard, hard, very hard, extremely hard
# Consistency of Moist Soil: loose, very friable, friable, firm, very firm, extremely firm
# Consistency of Wet Soil: nonsticky, slightly sticky, sticky, very sticky; nonplastic, slightly plastic, plastic, very plastic
# Consistency of Cemented Soil: weakly cemented, strongly cemented, indurated (requires hammer blows to break up){{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=62–63, 565–67}}

Soil consistency is useful in estimating the ability of soil to support buildings and roads. More precise measures of soil strength are often made prior to construction.

Soil [[heat flux]] refers to the rate at which [[heat energy]] moves through the soil in response to a temperature difference between two points in the soil. The heat [[flux density]] is the amount of energy that flows through soil per unit area per unit time and has both magnitude and direction. For the simple case of conduction into or out of the soil in the vertical direction, which is most often applicable the heat flux density is:

: &lt;math&gt;q_x  = - k \frac{\delta T}{\delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

In [[SI]] units
: &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is the heat flux density, in SI the units are [[Watt|W]]·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the soils' [[thermal conductivity|conductivity]], [[Watt|W]]·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·[[Kelvin|K]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The thermal conductivity is sometimes a constant, otherwise an average value of conductivity for the soil condition between the surface and the point at depth is used.
: &lt;math&gt;\delta T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature difference ([[temperature gradient]]) between the two points in the soil between which the heat flux density is to be calculated. In SI the units are kelvin, [[Kelvin|K]].
: &lt;math&gt;\delta x&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the two points within the soil, at which the temperatures are measured and between which the heat flux density is being calculated. In SI the units are meters [[meter|m]], and where x is measured positive downward.

Heat flux is in the direction opposite the temperature gradient, hence the minus sign. That is to say, if the temperature of the surface is higher than at depth x the negative sign will result in a positive value for the heat flux q, and which is interpreted as the heat being conducted into the soil.

===Color===
{{Main|Soil color}}
Soil colour is often the first impression one has when viewing soil. Striking colours and contrasting patterns are especially noticeable. The [[Red River of the South]] carries sediment eroded from extensive reddish soils like [[Port Silt Loam]] in Oklahoma. The [[Yellow River]] in China carries yellow sediment from eroding loess soils. [[Mollisols]] in the [[Great Plains]] of North America are darkened and enriched by organic matter. [[Podsol]]s in [[Taiga|boreal forests]] have highly contrasting layers due to acidity and leaching.

In general, color is determined by the organic matter content, drainage conditions, and degree of oxidation. Soil color, while easily discerned, has little use in predicting soil characteristics.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=71}} It is of use in distinguishing boundaries of [[Soil horizon|horizons]] within a soil profile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/sss/2014/03/30/soil-color-never-lies/ |publisher=[[European Geosciences Union]] |title=Soil color never lies |accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; determining the origin of a soil's [[parent material]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Viscarra Rossel |first1=Raphael A. |last2=Cattle |first2=Stephen R. |last3=Ortega |first3=A. |last4=Fouad |first4=Youssef |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Geoderma |volume=150 |title=In situ measurements of soil colour, mineral composition and clay content by vis–NIR spectroscopy |year=2009 |pages=253–66 |df=dmy-all |citeseerx=10.1.1.462.5659 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as an indication of wetness and [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogged]] conditions,&lt;ref name="Blavet"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blavet |first1=Didier |last2=Mathe |first2=E. |last3=Leprun |first3=Jean-Claude |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Catena |volume=39 |issue=3 |title=Relations between soil colour and waterlogging duration in a representative hillside of the West African granito-gneissic bedrock |url=http://horizon.documentation.ird.fr/exl-doc/pleins_textes/pleins_textes_7/b_fdi_55-56/010021572.pdf |year=2000 |pages=187–210 |doi=10.1016/S0341-8162(99)00087-9 |accessdate=13 January 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a qualitative means of measuring organic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shields |first1=J.

The rate at which a soil can absorb water depends on the soil and its other conditions. As a plant grows, its roots remove water from the largest pores ([[macropores]]) first. Soon the larger pores hold only air, and the remaining water is found only in the intermediate- and smallest-sized pores ([[micropores]]). The water in the smallest pores is so strongly held to particle surfaces that plant roots cannot pull it away. Consequently, not all soil water is available to plants, with a strong dependence on [[Soil texture|texture]].&lt;ref name="Easton"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/75545/BSE-194.pdf |last1=Easton |first1=Zachary M. |last2=Bock |first2=Emily |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Soil and soil water relationships |website=[[Virginia Tech]] |accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When saturated, the soil may lose nutrients as the water drains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sims |first1=J.

===Water retention forces===
{{Further|Soil water (retention)|Water retention curve}}
Water is retained in a soil when the [[adhesive force]] of attraction that water's [[hydrogen]] atoms have for the [[oxygen]] of soil particles is stronger than the cohesive forces that water's hydrogen feels for other water oxygen atoms.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=72–74}} When a field is flooded, the soil [[pore space]] is completely filled by water. The field will drain under the force of gravity until it reaches what is called [[field capacity]], at which point the smallest pores are filled with water and the largest with water and gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/r4082e/r4082e03.htm |title=Soil and water |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] |accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total amount of water held when field capacity is reached is a function of the [[specific surface area]] of the soil particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Petersen |first1=Lis Wollesen |last2=Møldrup |first2=Per |last3=Jacobsen |first3=Ole H. |last4=Rolston |first4=Dennis E. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Soil Science |volume=161 |issue=1 |title=Relations between specific surface area and soil physical and chemical properties |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232162864 |year=1996 |pages=9–21 |doi=10.1097/00010694-199601000-00003 |accessdate=10 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, high clay and high organic soils have higher field capacities.&lt;ref name="Gupta1979"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gupta |first1=Satish C. |last2=Larson |first2=William E. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Water Resources Research]] |volume=15 |issue=6 |title=Estimating soil water retention characteristics from particle size distribution, organic matter percent, and bulk density |year=1979 |pages=1633–5 |doi=10.1029/WR015i006p01633 |bibcode=1979WRR....15.1633G |citeseerx=10.1.1.475.497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total force required to pull or push water out of soil is termed [[suction]] and usually expressed in units of bars (10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; pascal) which is just a little less than one-atmosphere pressure. Alternatively, the terms "soil moisture tension" or [[water potential]] may be used.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=72–75}}

===Moisture classification===
The forces with which water is held in soils determine its availability to plants. Forces of [[adhesion]] hold water strongly to mineral and humus surfaces and less strongly to itself by cohesive forces. A plant's root may penetrate a very small volume of water that is adhering to soil and be initially able to draw in water that is only lightly held by the cohesive forces. But as the droplet is drawn down, the forces of adhesion of the water for the soil particles produce increasingly higher [[suction]], finally up to 15&amp;nbsp;bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Savage |first1=Michael J. |last2=Ritchie |first2=Joe T. |last3=Bland |first3=William L. |last4=Dugas |first4=William A. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Agronomy Journal]] |volume=88 |issue=4 |title=Lower limit of soil water availability |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309079210 |year=1996 |pages=644–51 |doi=10.2134/agronj1996.00021962008800040024x |accessdate=12 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 15&amp;nbsp;bar suction, the soil water amount is called [[wilting point]]. At that suction the plant cannot sustain its water needs as water is still being lost from the plant by transpiration, the plant's turgidity is lost, and it wilts, although [[stoma]]tal closure may decrease transpiration and thus may retard wilting below the [[wilting point]], in particular under [[adaptation]] or [[acclimatization]] to drought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Al-Ani |first1=Tariq |last2=Bierhuizen |first2=Johan Frederik |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Acta Botanica Neerlandica |volume=20 |issue=3 |title=Stomatal resistance, transpiration, and relative water content as influenced by soil moisture stress |url=http://natuurtijdschriften.nl/download?type=document&amp;docid=539770 |year=1971 |pages=318–26 |doi=10.1111/j.1438-8677.1971.tb00715.x |accessdate=12 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next level, called air-dry, occurs at 1000&amp;nbsp;bar suction. Finally the oven dry condition is reached at 10,000&amp;nbsp;bar suction. All water below wilting percentage is called unavailable water.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=75–76}}

===Soil moisture content===
{{see also|Soil moisture sensor|Moisture content}}
When the soil moisture content is optimal for plant growth, the water in the large and intermediate size pores can move about in the soil and be easily used by plants.&lt;ref name="Easton"/&gt; The amount of water remaining in a soil drained to field capacity and the amount that is available are functions of the soil type. Sandy soil will retain very little water, while clay will hold the maximum amount.&lt;ref name="Gupta1979"/&gt; The time required to drain a field from flooded condition for a clay [[loam]] that begins at 43% water by weight to a field capacity of 22% is six days, whereas a sand loam that is flooded to its maximum of 22% water will take two days to reach field capacity of 11% water. The available water for the clay loam might be 11% whereas for the sand loam it might be only 8% by weight.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=76–77}}

The above are average values for the soil textures as the percentages of sand, silt and clay vary.

===Water flow===
Water moves through soil due to the force of [[gravity]], [[osmosis]] and [[capillarity]]. At zero to one-third bar [[suction]], water is pushed through soil from the point of its application under the force of gravity and the pressure gradient created by the pressure of the water; this is called saturated flow. At higher suction, water movement is pulled by capillarity from wetter toward drier soil. This is caused by water's [[adhesion]] to soil solids, and is called unsaturated flow.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=85}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eagri.org/eagri50/AGRO103/lec03.pdf |title=Soil water movement: saturated and unsaturated flow and vapour movement, soil moisture constants and their importance in irrigation |website=[[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] |accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water infiltration and movement in soil is controlled by six factors:

# Soil texture
# Soil structure. Fine-textured soils with granular structure are most favourable to infiltration of water.
# The amount of organic matter. Coarse matter is best and if on the surface helps prevent the destruction of soil structure and the creation of crusts.
# Depth of soil to impervious layers such as hardpans or bedrock
# The amount of water already in the soil
# Soil temperature. Warm soils take in water faster while frozen soils may not be able to absorb depending on the type of freezing.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=86}}

Water infiltration rates range from {{convert|0.25|cm|in|abbr=on}} per hour for high clay soils to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} per hour for sand and well stabilised and aggregated soil structures.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=88}} Water flows through the ground unevenly, in the form of so-called "gravity fingers", because of the [[surface tension]] between water particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cueto-Felgueroso |first1=Luis |last2=Juanes |first2=Ruben |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=101 |issue=24 |title=Nonlocal interface dynamics and pattern formation in gravity-driven unsaturated flow through porous media |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bcee/6f04cc7a8bc8df98d0cb48410ccb1efb6a33.pdf |year=2008 |pages=244504 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.244504 |pmid=19113626 |accessdate=21 May 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2008PhRvL.101x4504C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soilandwater.bee.cornell.edu/research/pfweb/educators/intro/fingerflow.htm |title=Finger flow in coarse soils |website=[[Cornell University]] |accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water uptake by plants===
Of equal importance to the storage and movement of water in soil is the means by which plants acquire it and their nutrients. Most soil water is taken up by plants as passive [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] caused by the pulling force of water evaporating ([[transpiration|transpiring]]) from the long column of water ([[xylem sap]] flow) that leads from the plant's roots to its leaves, according to the [[cohesion-tension theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aston |first1=M.

Root extension is vital for plant survival. A study of a single winter rye plant grown for four months in one cubic foot of loam soil showed that the plant developed 13,800,000 roots, a total of 385&amp;nbsp;miles in length with 2,550&amp;nbsp;square feet in surface area; and 14&amp;nbsp;billion hair roots of 6,600&amp;nbsp;miles total length and 4,320&amp;nbsp;square feet total area; for a total surface area of 6,870&amp;nbsp;square feet (83&amp;nbsp;ft squared). The total surface area of the loam soil was estimated to be 560,000&amp;nbsp;square feet.{{sfn|Wadleigh|1957|p=46}} In other words, the roots were in contact with only 1.2% of the soil. However, root extension should be viewed as a dynamic process, allowing new roots to explore a new volume of soil each day, increasing dramatically the total volume of soil explored over a given growth period, and thus the volume of water taken up by the root system over this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kramer |first1=Paul J. |last2=Coile |first2=Theodore S. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Plant Physiology (journal)|Plant Physiology]] |volume=15 |issue=4 |title=An estimation of the volume of water made available by root extension |year=1940 |pages=743–7 |doi=10.1104/pp.15.4.743 |pmid=16653671 |pmc=437871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Root architecture, i.e. the spatial configuration of the root system, plays a prominent role in the adaptation of plants to soil water and nutrient availabiity, and thus in plant productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lynch |first=Jonathan |journal=[[Plant Physiology (journal)|Plant Physiology]] |volume=109 |issue=1 |title=Root architecture and plant productivity |year=1995 |pages=7–13 |doi=10.1104/pp.109.1.7 |pmid=12228579 |pmc=157559 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roots must seek out water as the unsaturated flow of water in soil can move only at a rate of up to 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm (one inch) per day; as a result they are constantly dying and growing as they seek out high concentrations of soil moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Comas |first1=Louise H. |last2=Eissenstat |first2=David M. |last3=Lakso |first3=Alan N. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=147 |issue=1 |title=Assessing root death and root system dynamics in a study of grape canopy pruning |year=2000 |pages=171–8 |doi=10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00679.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Insufficient soil moisture, to the point of causing [[wilting]], will cause permanent damage and [[crop yield]]s will suffer.

===Consumptive use and water use efficiency===
Only a small fraction (0.1% to 1%) of the water used by a plant is held within the plant. The majority is ultimately lost via [[transpiration]], while [[evaporation]] from the soil surface is also substantial, the transpiration:evaporation ratio varying according to vegetation type and climate, peaking in [[tropical rainforests]] and dipping in [[steppes]] and [[deserts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schlesinger |first1=William H. |last2=Jasechko |first2=Scott |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Agricultural and Forest Meteorology]] |volume=189/190 |title=Transpiration in the global water cycle |url=http://www.isohydro.ca/uploads/1/4/1/9/14194300/2014-schlesinger-jasechko-agformet.pdf |year=2014 |pages=115–7 |doi=10.1016/j.agrformet.2014.01.011 |accessdate=22 July 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|bibcode=2014AgFM..189..115S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transpiration plus evaporative soil moisture loss is called [[evapotranspiration]].

The total water used in an agricultural field includes [[surface runoff]], [[drainage]] and consumptive use. The use of loose [[mulch]]es will reduce evaporative losses for a period after a field is irrigated, but in the end the total evaporative loss (plant plus soil) will approach that of an uncovered soil, while more water is immediately available for plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tolk |first1=Judy A. |last2=Howell |first2=Terry A. |last3=Evett |first3=Steve R. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Soil and Tillage Research |volume=50 |issue=2 |title=Effect of mulch, irrigation, and soil type on water use and yield of maize |url=https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/pubag/downloadPDF.xhtml?id=1896&amp;content=PDF |year=1999 |pages=137–47 |doi=10.1016/S0167-1987(99)00011-2 |accessdate=15 July 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water use efficiency]] is measured by the [[transpiration ratio]], which is the ratio of the total water transpired by a plant to the dry weight of the harvested plant. Transpiration ratios for crops range from 300 to 700. For example, alfalfa may have a transpiration ratio of 500 and as a result 500&amp;nbsp;kilograms of water will produce one&amp;nbsp;kilogram of dry alfalfa.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=97–99}}

==Atmosphere==
The atmosphere of soil, or [[soil gas]], is radically different from the atmosphere above. The consumption of [[oxygen]] by microbes and plant roots, and their release of [[carbon dioxide]], decrease oxygen and increase carbon dioxide concentration. Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration is 0.04%, but in the soil [[pore space]] it may range from 10 to 100 times that level, thus potentially contributing to the inhibition of root respiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Qi |first1=Jingen |last2=Marshall |first2=John D. |last3=Mattson |first3=Kim G. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[New Phytologist]] |volume=128 |issue=3 |title=High soil carbon dioxide concentrations inhibit root respiration of Douglas fir |year=1994 |pages=435–42 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.1994.tb02989.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcareous soils regulate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration thanks to [[carbonate]] [[Buffering agent|buffering]], contrary to acid soils in which all CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respired accumulates in the soil pore system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karberg |first1=Noah J. |last2=Pregitzer |first2=Kurt S. |last3=King |first3=John S. |last4=Friend |first4=Aaron L. |last5=Wood |first5=James R. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=[[Oecologia]] |volume=142 |issue=2 |title=Soil carbon dioxide partial pressure and dissolved inorganic carbonate chemistry under elevated carbon dioxide and ozone |url=https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/jrnl/2004/nc_2004_Karberg_001.pdf |year=2005 |pages=296–306 |doi=10.1007/s00442-004-1665-5 |pmid=15378342 |accessdate=26 August 2018 |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; At extreme levels CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chang |first1=H.

* '''Illite''' is a 2:1 clay similar in structure to montmorillonite but has potassium bridges between the faces of the clay crystals and the degree of swelling depends on the degree of weathering of the potassium. The active surface area is reduced due to the potassium bonds. Illite originates from the modification of mica, a primary mineral. It is often found together with montmorillonite and its primary minerals. It has moderate CEC.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=108–10}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|pp=33–34}}{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=82}}{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=90}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|p=103}}
* '''Vermiculite''' is a mica-based clay similar to illite, but the crystals of clay are held together more loosely by hydrated magnesium and it will swell, but not as much as does montmorillonite. It has very high CEC.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=110}}{{sfn|Coleman|Mehlich|1957|p=73}}{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=90}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|p=103}}
* '''Chlorite''' is similar to vermiculite, but the loose bonding by occasional hydrated magnesium, as in vermiculite, is replaced by a hydrated magnesium sheet, that firmly bonds the planes above and below it. It has two planes of silicon, one of aluminium and one of magnesium; hence it is a 2:2 clay. Chlorite does not swell and it has low CEC.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=110}}{{sfn|Holmes|Brown|1957|p=112}}
* '''Kaolinite''' is very common, highly weathered clay, and more common than montmorillonite in acid soils. It has one silica and one alumina plane per crystal; hence it is a 1:1 type clay. One plane of silica of montmorillonite is dissolved and is replaced with hydroxyls, which produces strong hydrogen bonds to the oxygen in the next crystal of clay. As a result, kaolinite does not swell in water and has a low specific surface area, and as almost no isomorphous substitution has occurred it has a low CEC. Where rainfall is high, acid soils selectively leach more silica than alumina from the original clays, leaving kaolinite. Even heavier weathering results in sesquioxide clays.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=111}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|p=33}}{{sfn|Coleman|Mehlich|1957|p=74}}{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=82}}{{sfn|Olsen|Fried|1957|p=96}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|p=101}}

====Crystalline chain clays====
The carbonate and sulfate minerals are much more soluble and hence are found primarily in desert soils where leaching is less active.

====Amorphous clays====
'''Amorphous clays''' are young, and commonly found in volcanic ash. They are mixtures of alumina and silica which have not formed the ordered crystal shape of alumino-silica clays which time would provide. The majority of their negative charges originates from hydroxyl ions, which can gain or lose a hydrogen ion (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in response to soil pH, in such way was as to buffer the soil pH. They may have either a negative charge provided by the attached hydroxyl ion (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), which can attract a cation, or lose the hydrogen of the hydroxyl to solution and display a positive charge which can attract anions. As a result, they may display either high CEC in an acid soil solution, or high anion exchange capacity in a basic soil solution.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=111}}

====Sesquioxide clays====
'''[[Sesquioxide]] clays''' are a product of heavy rainfall that has leached most of the silica from alumino-silica clay, leaving the less soluble oxides iron hematite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), aluminium hydroxide gibbsite (Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrated manganese birnessite (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). It takes hundreds of thousands of years of leaching to create sesquioxide clays. ''Sesqui'' is Latin for "one and one-half": there are three parts oxygen to two parts iron or aluminium; hence the ratio is one and one-half (not true for all). They are hydrated and act as either amorphous or crystalline. They are not sticky and do not swell, and soils high in them behave much like sand and can rapidly pass water. They are able to hold large quantities of phosphates. Sesquioxides have low CEC but are able to hold anions as well as cations. Such soils range from yellow to red in colour. Such clays tend to hold phosphorus so tightly that it is unavailable for absorption by plants.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=103–12}}{{sfn|Simonson|1957|pp=18, 21–24, 29}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|pp=32, 35}}

===Organic colloids===
[[Humus]] is the final state of decomposition of organic matter. While it may linger for a thousand years, on the larger scale of the age of the mineral soil components, it is temporary. It is composed of the very stable [[lignin]]s (30%) and complex sugars ([[polyuronide]]s, 30%), proteins (30%), waxes, and fats that are resistant to breakdown by microbes. Its chemical assay is 60% carbon, 5% nitrogen, some oxygen and the remainder hydrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. On a dry weight basis, the CEC of humus is many times greater than that of clay.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=112}}{{sfn|Russell|1957|p=35}}{{sfn|Allaway|1957|p=69}}

===Carbon and terra preta===
In the extreme environment of high temperatures and the leaching caused by the heavy rain of tropical rain forests, the clay and organic colloids are largely destroyed. The heavy rains wash the alumino-silicate clays from the soil leaving only sesquioxide clays of low CEC. The high temperatures and humidity allow bacteria and fungi to virtually dissolve any organic matter on the rain-forest floor overnight and much of the nutrients are volatilized or leached from the soil and lost. However, carbon in the form of charcoal is far more stable than soil colloids and is capable of performing many of the functions of the soil colloids of sub-tropical soils. Soil containing substantial quantities of charcoal, of an anthropogenic origin, is called [[terra preta]]. Research into terra preta is still young but is promising. Fallow periods "on the Amazonian Dark Earths can be as short as 6 months, whereas fallow periods on [[oxisol]]s are usually 8 to 10 years long"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lehmann|first=J.|title=Terra Preta de Indio|url=http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/research/terra%20preta/terrapretamain.html|publisher=University of Cornell, Dept. of Crop and Soil Sciences|accessdate=30 March 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424061552/http://www.css.cornell.edu/faculty/lehmann/research/terra%20preta/terrapretamain.html|archivedate=24 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==
{{for|the [[academic discipline]]|Soil chemistry}}

The chemistry of a soil determines its ability to supply available [[Plant nutrition|plant nutrients]] and affects its physical properties and the health of its microbial population. In addition, a soil's chemistry also determines its corrosivity, stability, and ability to absorb pollutants and to filter water. It is the surface chemistry of mineral and organic [[colloids]] that determines soil's chemical properties. "A colloid is a small, insoluble, nondiffusible particle larger than a molecule but small enough to remain suspended in a fluid medium without settling. Most soils contain organic colloidal particles called humus as well as the inorganic colloidal particles of clays." The very high [[specific surface area]] of colloids and their net charges, gives soil its ability to hold and release ions. Negatively charged sites on colloids attract and release cations in what is referred to as cation exchange. [[Cation-exchange capacity]] (CEC) is the amount of exchangeable cations per unit weight of dry soil and is expressed in terms of milliequivalents of positively charged ions per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of soil (or centimoles of positive charge per kilogram of soil; cmol&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;/kg). Similarly, positively charged sites on colloids can attract and release anions in the soil giving the soil [[cation-exchange capacity|anion exchange capacity]] (AEC).

===Cation and anion exchange===
{{Further|Cation-exchange capacity}}
The cation exchange, that takes place between colloids and soil water, buffers (moderates) soil pH, alters soil structure, and purifies percolating water by adsorbing cations of all types, both useful and harmful.

The negative or positive charges on colloid particles make them able to hold cations or anions, respectively, to their surfaces. The charges result from four sources.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=103–06}}

# Isomorphous substitution occurs in clay during its formation, when lower-valence cations substitute for higher-valence cations in the crystal structure. Substitutions in the outermost layers are more effective than for the innermost layers, as the charge strength drops off as the square of the distance. The net result is oxygen atoms with net negative charge and the ability to attract cations.
# Edge-of-clay oxygen atoms are not in balance ionically as the tetrahedral and octahedral structures are incomplete.
# Hydroxyls may substitute for oxygens of the silica layers. When the hydrogens of the clay hydroxyls are ionised into solution, they leave the oxygen with a negative charge.
# Hydrogens of humus hydroxyl groups may be ionised into solution, leaving an oxygen with a negative charge.

Cations held to the negatively charged colloids resist being washed downward by water and out of reach of plants' roots, thereby preserving the fertility of soils in areas of moderate rainfall and low temperatures.

There is a hierarchy in the process of cation exchange on colloids, as they differ in the strength of adsorption by the colloid and hence their ability to replace one another. If present in equal amounts in the soil water solution:

Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; same as NH&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; replaces Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

If one cation is added in large amounts, it may replace the others by the sheer force of its numbers. This is called mass action. This is largely what occurs with the addition of fertiliser.

As the soil solution becomes more acidic (low pH, and an abundance of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the other cations more weakly bound to colloids are pushed into solution as hydrogen ions occupy those sites. A low pH may cause hydrogen of hydroxyl groups to be pulled into solution, leaving charged sites on the colloid available to be occupied by other cations. This ionisation of hydroxyl groups on the surface of soil colloids creates what is described as pH-dependent charges. Unlike permanent charges developed by isomorphous substitution, pH-dependent charges are variable and increase with increasing pH.&lt;ref name="CEC"/&gt; Freed cations can be made available to plants but are also prone to be leached from the soil, possibly making the soil less fertile. Plants are able to excrete H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into the soil and by that means, change the pH of the soil near the root and push cations off the colloids, thus making those available to the plant.

====Cation exchange capacity (CEC)====
Cation exchange capacity should be thought of as the soil's ability to remove cations from the soil water solution and sequester those to be exchanged later as the plant roots release hydrogen ions to the solution. CEC is the amount of exchangeable hydrogen cation (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) that will combine with 100&amp;nbsp;grams dry weight of soil and whose measure is one milliequivalents per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of soil (1&amp;nbsp;meq/100&amp;nbsp;g). Hydrogen ions have a single charge and one-thousandth of a gram of hydrogen ions per 100&amp;nbsp;grams dry soil gives a measure of one milliequivalent of hydrogen ion. Calcium, with an atomic weight 40 times that of hydrogen and with a valence of two, converts to (40/2) x 1 milliequivalent = 20 milliequivalents of hydrogen ion per 100&amp;nbsp;grams of dry soil or 20&amp;nbsp;meq/100&amp;nbsp;g.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=114}} The modern measure of CEC is expressed as centimoles of positive charge per kilogram (cmol/kg) of oven-dry soil.

Most of the soil's CEC occurs on clay and humus colloids, and the lack of those in hot, humid, wet climates, due to leaching and decomposition respectively, explains the relative sterility of tropical soils. Live plant roots also have some CEC.

====Anion exchange capacity (AEC)====
Anion exchange capacity should be thought of as the soil's ability to remove anions from the soil water solution and sequester those for later exchange as the plant roots release carbonate anions to the soil water solution. Those colloids which have low CEC tend to have some AEC. Amorphous and sesquioxide clays have the highest AEC, followed by the iron oxides. Levels of AEC are much lower than for CEC. Phosphates tend to be held at anion exchange sites.

Iron and aluminum hydroxide clays are able to exchange their hydroxide anions (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) for other anions. The order reflecting the strength of anion adhesion is as follows:

:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  replaces SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;  replaces NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;  replaces Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

The amount of exchangeable anions is of a magnitude of tenths to a few milliequivalents per 100&amp;nbsp;g dry soil.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=115–16}} As pH rises, there are relatively more hydroxyls, which will displace anions from the colloids and force them into solution and out of storage; hence AEC decreases with increasing pH (alkalinity).

===Reactivity (pH)===
{{Main|Soil pH|Soil pH#Effect of soil pH on plant growth}}
Soil reactivity is expressed in terms of pH and is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of the soil. More precisely, it is a measure of hydrogen ion concentration in an aqueous solution and ranges in values from 0 to 14 (acidic to basic) but practically speaking for soils, pH ranges from 3.5 to 9.5, as pH values beyond those extremes are toxic to life forms.

At 25&amp;nbsp;°C an aqueous solution that has a pH of 3.5 has 10&lt;sup&gt;−3.5&lt;/sup&gt; [[mole (unit)|moles]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (hydrogen ions) per litre of solution (and also 10&lt;sup&gt;−10.5&lt;/sup&gt; mole/litre OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). A pH of 7, defined as neutral, has 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; moles hydrogen ions per litre of solution and also 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; moles of OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; per litre; since the two concentrations are equal, they are said to neutralise each other. A pH of 9.5 has 10&lt;sup&gt;−9.5&lt;/sup&gt; moles hydrogen ions per litre of solution (and also 10&lt;sup&gt;−2.5&lt;/sup&gt; mole per litre OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). A pH of 3.5 has one million times more hydrogen ions per litre than a solution with pH of 9.5 (9.5 - 3.5  = 6 or 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) and is more acidic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chang|first=Raymond|title=Chemistry|year=1984|publisher=Random House, Inc.|isbn=978-0394329833|page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of pH on a soil is to remove from the soil or to make available certain ions. Soils with high acidity tend to have toxic amounts of aluminium and manganese. Plants which need calcium need moderate alkalinity, but most minerals are more soluble in acid soils. Soil organisms are hindered by high acidity, and most agricultural crops do best with mineral soils of pH&amp;nbsp;6.5 and organic soils of pH&amp;nbsp;5.5.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=116–17}}

In high rainfall areas, soils tend to acidity as the basic cations are forced off the soil colloids by the mass action of hydrogen ions from the rain as those attach to the colloids. High rainfall rates can then wash the nutrients out, leaving the soil sterile. Once the colloids are saturated with H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the addition of any more hydrogen ions or aluminum hydroxyl cations drives the pH even lower (more acidic) as the soil has been left with no buffering capacity. In areas of extreme rainfall and high temperatures, the clay and humus may be washed out, further reducing the buffering capacity of the soil. In low rainfall areas, unleached calcium pushes pH to 8.5 and with the addition of exchangeable sodium, soils may reach pH&amp;nbsp;10. Beyond a pH of 9, plant growth is reduced. High pH results in low micro-nutrient mobility, but water-soluble chelates of those nutrients can correct the deficit. Sodium can be reduced by the addition of [[gypsum]] (calcium sulphate) as calcium adheres to clay more tightly than does sodium causing sodium to be pushed into the soil water solution where it can be washed out by an abundance of water.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=116–19}}

====Base saturation percentage====
There are acid-forming cations (hydrogen and aluminium) and there are base-forming cations. The fraction of the base-forming cations that occupy positions on the soil colloids is called the base saturation percentage. If a soil has a CEC of 20 meq and 5 meq are aluminium and hydrogen cations (acid-forming), the remainder of positions on the colloids (20-5 = 15 meq) are assumed occupied by base-forming cations, so that the percentage base saturation is 15/20 x 100% = 75% (the compliment 25% is assumed acid-forming cations). When the soil pH is 7 (neutral), base saturation is 100&amp;nbsp;percent and there are no hydrogen ions stored on the colloids. Base saturation is almost in direct proportion to pH (increases with increasing pH). It is of use in calculating the amount of lime needed to neutralise an acid soil. The amount of lime needed to neutralize a soil must take account of the amount of acid forming ions on the colloids not just those in the soil water solution. The addition of enough lime to neutralize the soil water solution will be insufficient to change the pH, as the acid forming cations stored on the soil colloids will tend to restore the original pH condition as they are pushed off those colloids by the calcium of the added lime.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=119–20}}

===Buffering===
{{Further|Soil conditioner}}
The resistance of soil to change in pH, as a result of the addition of acid or basic material, is a measure of the buffering capacity of a soil and (for a particular soil type) increases as the CEC increases. Hence, pure sand has almost no buffering ability, while soils high in colloids have high buffering capacity. Buffering occurs by cation exchange and neutralisation.

The addition of a small amount highly basic aqueous ammonia to a soil will cause the ammonium to displace hydrogen ions from the colloids, and the end product is water and colloidally fixed ammonium, but little permanent change overall in soil pH.

The addition of a small amount of [[liming (soil)|lime]], Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, will displace hydrogen ions from the soil colloids, causing the fixation of calcium to colloids and the evolution of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and water, with little permanent change in soil pH.

The above are examples of the buffering of soil pH. The general principal is that an increase in a particular cation in the soil water solution will cause that cation to be fixed to colloids (buffered) and a decrease in solution of that cation will cause it to be withdrawn from the colloid and moved into solution (buffered). The degree of buffering is often related to the CEC of the soil; the greater the CEC, the greater the buffering capacity of the soil.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=120–21}}

==Nutrients==
{{Main|Plant nutrition|Soil pH#Effect of soil pH on plant growth}}
Sixteen elements or nutrients are essential for plant growth and reproduction. They are [[carbon]] '''C''', [[hydrogen]] '''H''', [[oxygen]] '''O''', [[nitrogen]] '''N''', [[phosphorus]] '''P''', [[potassium]] '''K''', [[sulfur]] '''S''', [[calcium]] '''Ca''', [[magnesium]] '''Mg''', [[iron]] '''Fe''', [[boron]] '''B''', [[manganese]] '''Mn''', [[copper]] '''Cu''', [[zinc]] '''Zn''', [[molybdenum]] '''Mo''', [[nickel]] '''Ni''' and [[chlorine]] '''Cl'''.{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=80}}{{sfn|Russel|1957|pp=123–25}}&lt;ref name = BradyWeil&gt;{{cite book | title = The nature and properties of soils | year = 2008 | edition = 14th | last1 = Brady | first1 = Nyle C. | last2 = Weil | first2 = Ray R. | publisher = Pearson | location = Upper Saddle River, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrients required for plants to complete their life cycle are considered '''essential nutrients'''. Nutrients that enhance the growth of plants but are not necessary to complete the plant's life cycle are considered '''non-essential'''. With the exception of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, which are supplied by carbon dioxide and water, and nitrogen, provided through [[nitrogen fixation]],&lt;ref name = BradyWeil/&gt; the nutrients derive originally from the mineral component of the soil.

Plant uptake of nutrients can only proceed when they are present in a plant-available form. In most situations, nutrients are absorbed in an ionic form from (or together with) soil water. Although minerals are the origin of most nutrients, and the bulk of most nutrient elements in the soil is held in crystalline form within primary and secondary minerals, they [[weathering|weather]] too slowly to support rapid plant growth. For example, The application of finely ground minerals, [[feldspar]] and [[apatite]], to soil seldom provides the necessary amounts of potassium and phosphorus at a rate sufficient for good plant growth, as most of the nutrients remain bound in the crystals of those minerals.{{sfn|Dean|1957|pp=80–81}}

The nutrients adsorbed onto the surfaces of clay colloids and [[soil organic matter]] provide a more accessible reservoir of many plant nutrients (e.g. K, Ca, Mg, P, Zn). As plants absorb the nutrients from the soil water, the soluble pool is replenished from the surface-bound pool. The decomposition of [[soil organic matter]] by microorganisms is another mechanism whereby the soluble pool of nutrients is replenished – this is important for the supply of plant-available N, S, P, and B from soil.&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/soilbiodiversity/Downloadable_files/fpnb16.pdf|title=Plant nutrition for food security: a guide for integrated nutrient management|last1=Roy|first1=R.N.|last2=Finck|first2=A.|last3=Blair|first3=G.J.|last4=Tandon|first4=H.L.S.|date=2006|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|year=|isbn=978-9251054901|location=Rome|pages=43–90|chapter=Chapter 4: Soil fertility and crop production|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gram for gram, the capacity of humus to hold nutrients and water is far greater than that of clay minerals. All in all, small amounts of humus may remarkably increase the soil's capacity to promote plant growth.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=123–31}}&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4" /&gt;

===Uptake processes===
Nutrients in the soil are taken up by the plant through its roots. To be taken up by a plant, a nutrient element must be located near the root surface; however, the supply of nutrients in contact with the root is rapidly depleted. There are three basic mechanisms whereby nutrient ions dissolved in the soil solution are brought into contact with plant roots:

# Mass flow of water
# Diffusion within water
# Interception by root growth

All three mechanisms operate simultaneously, but one mechanism or another may be most important for a particular nutrient. For example, in the case of calcium, which is generally plentiful in the soil solution, mass flow alone can usually bring sufficient amounts to the root surface. However, in the case of phosphorus, diffusion is needed to supplement mass flow. For the most part, nutrient ions must travel some distance in the soil solution to reach the root surface. This movement can take place by mass flow, as when dissolved nutrients are carried along with the soil water flowing toward a root that is actively drawing water from the soil. In this type of movement, the nutrient ions are somewhat analogous to leaves floating down a stream. In addition, nutrient ions continually move by diffusion from areas of greater concentration toward the nutrient-depleted areas of lower concentration around the root surface. That process is due to random motion of molecules. By this means, plants can continue to take up nutrients even at night, when water is only slowly absorbed into the roots as transpiration has almost stopped. Finally, root interception comes into play as roots continually grow into new, undepleted soil.

In the above table, phosphorus and potassium nutrients move more by diffusion than they do by mass flow in the soil water solution, as they are rapidly taken up by the roots creating a concentration of almost zero near the roots (the plants cannot transpire enough water to draw more of those nutrients near the roots). The very steep concentration gradient is of greater influence in the movement of those ions than is the movement of those by mass flow.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement by mass flow requires the transpiration of water from the plant causing water and solution ions to also move toward the roots. Movement by root interception is slowest as the plants must extend their roots.

Plants move ions out of their roots in an effort to move nutrients in from the soil. Hydrogen H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is exchanged for other cations, and carbonate (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and hydroxide (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) anions are exchanged for nutrient anions. As plant roots remove nutrients from the soil water solution, they are replenished as other ions move off of clay and humus (by [[ion exchange]] or [[desorption]]), are added from the [[weathering]] of soil minerals, and are released by the [[Soil organic matter#Decomposition|decomposition of soil organic matter]]. Plants derive a large proportion of their anion nutrients from decomposing organic matter, which typically holds about 95&amp;nbsp;percent of the soil nitrogen, 5 to 60&amp;nbsp;percent of the soil phosphorus and about 80&amp;nbsp;percent of the soil sulfur. Where crops are produced, the replenishment of nutrients in the soil must usually be augmented by the addition of fertilizer or organic matter.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=126}}

Because nutrient uptake is an active metabolic process, conditions that inhibit root metabolism may also inhibit nutrient uptake. Examples of such conditions include [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] or [[soil compaction]] resulting in poor soil aeration, excessively high or low soil temperatures, and above-ground conditions that result in low translocation of sugars to plant roots.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=123–28}}

===Carbon===
[[File:SRS2000 soil respiration system.jpg|thumb|Measuring soil respiration in the field using an SRS2000 system.]]
Plants obtain their carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide. About 45% of a plant's dry mass is carbon; plant residues typically have a carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) of between 13:1 and 100:1. As the soil organic material is digested by arthropods and micro-organisms, the C/N decreases as the carbonaceous material is metabolized and carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is released as a byproduct which then finds its way out of the soil and into the atmosphere. The nitrogen is sequestered in the bodies of the living matter of those decomposing organisms and so it builds up in the soil. Normal CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration in the atmosphere is 0.03%, this can be the factor limiting plant growth. In a field of maize on a still day during high light conditions in the growing season, the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration drops very low, but under such conditions the crop could use up to 20 times the normal concentration. The respiration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by soil micro-organisms decomposing soil organic matter contributes an important amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the photosynthesising plants. Within the soil, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration is 10 to 100 times that of atmospheric levels but may rise to toxic levels if the soil porosity is low or if diffusion is impeded by flooding.{{sfn|Wadleigh|1957|p=41}}{{sfn|Dean|1957|p=80}}{{sfn|Broadbent|1957|p=153}}

===Nitrogen===
{{Further|Nitrogen cycle}}
[[File:SoilNitrogen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|{{center|Generalization of percent soil nitrogen by soil order}}]]
Nitrogen is the most critical element obtained by plants from the soil and [[nitrogen deficiency]] often limits plant growth.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=128}} Plants can use the nitrogen as either the ammonium cation (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) or the anion nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Usually, most of the nitrogen in soil is bound within organic compounds that make up the soil organic matter, and must be [[Mineralization (soil science)|mineralized]] to the ammonium or nitrate form before it can be taken up by most plants. The total nitrogen content depends largely on the soil organic matter content, which in turn depends on the climate, vegetation, topography, age and soil management. Soil nitrogen typically decreases by 0.2 to 0.3% for every temperature increase by 10&amp;nbsp;°C. Usually, grassland soils contain more soil nitrogen than forest soils. Cultivation decreases soil nitrogen by exposing soil organic matter to decomposition by microorganisms, and soils under no-tillage maintain more soil nitrogen than tilled soils.

Some micro-organisms are able to metabolise organic matter and release ammonium in a process called ''mineralisation''. Others take free ammonium and oxidise it to nitrate. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria are capable of metabolising N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the form of ammonia in a process called [[nitrogen fixation]]. Both ammonium and nitrate can be ''immobilized'' by their incorporation into the microbes' living cells, where it is temporarily sequestered in the form of amino acids and protein. Nitrate may also be lost from the soil when bacteria metabolise it to the gases N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The loss of gaseous forms of nitrogen to the atmosphere due to microbial action is called ''denitrification''. Nitrogen may also be ''leached'' from the soil if it is in the form of nitrate or lost to the atmosphere as ammonia due to a chemical reaction of ammonium with alkaline soil by way of a process called ''volatilisation''. Ammonium may also be sequestered in clay by ''fixation''. A small amount of nitrogen is added to soil by rainfall.&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4" /&gt;{{sfn|Allison|1957|pp=85–94}}{{sfn|Broadbent|1957|pp=152–55}}{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=128–31}}

====Gains====
In the process of [[mineralization (soil)|mineralisation]], microbes feed on organic matter, releasing ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), ammonium (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and other nutrients. As long as the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) of fresh residues in the soil is above 30:1, nitrogen will be in short supply and other bacteria will feed on the ammonium and incorporate its nitrogen into their cells in the [[immobilization (soil science)|immobilization]] process. In that form the nitrogen is said to be ''immobilised''. Later, when such bacteria die, they too are ''mineralised'' and some of the nitrogen is released as ammonium and nitrate. If the C/N is less than 15, ammonia is freed to the soil, where it may be used by bacteria which [[redox|oxidise]] it to nitrate ([[nitrification]]). Bacteria may on average add {{convert|25|lb}} nitrogen per acre, and in an unfertilised field, this is the most important source of usable nitrogen. In a soil with 5% organic matter perhaps 2 to 5% of that is released to the soil by such decomposition. It occurs fastest in warm, moist, well aerated soil. The mineralisation of 3% of the organic material of a soil that is 4% organic matter overall, would release {{convert|120|lb}} of nitrogen as ammonium per acre.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=129–30}}

In [[nitrogen fixation]], [[rhizobium]] bacteria convert N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Rhizobia]] share a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] with host plants, since rhizobia supply the host with nitrogen and the host provides rhizobia with nutrients and a safe environment. It is estimated that such symbiotic bacteria in the [[root nodule]]s of [[legume]]s add 45 to 250&amp;nbsp;pounds of nitrogen per acre per year, which may be sufficient for the crop. Other, free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria and [[blue-green algae]] live independently in the soil and release nitrate when their dead bodies are converted by way of mineralisation.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=128–29}}

Some amount of usable nitrogen is fixed by [[lightning]] as nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Nitrogen dioxide is soluble in water to form [[nitric acid]] (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) solution of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. Ammonia, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, previously released from the soil or from combustion, may fall with precipitation as nitric acid at a rate of about five pounds nitrogen per acre per year.{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=87}}

====Sequestration====
When bacteria feed on soluble forms of nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate), they temporarily sequester that nitrogen in their bodies in a process called ''immobilisation''. At a later time when those bacteria die, their nitrogen may be released as ammonium by the processes of mineralisation.

Protein material is easily broken down, but the rate of its decomposition is slowed by its attachment to the crystalline structure of clay and when trapped between the clay layers. The layers are small enough that bacteria cannot enter. Some organisms can exude extracellular enzymes that can act on the sequestered proteins. However, those enzymes too may be trapped on the clay crystals.

Ammonium fixation occurs when ammonium pushes [[potassium]] ions from between the layers of clay such as [[illite]] or [[montmorillonite]]. Only a small fraction of soil nitrogen is held this way.{{sfn|Allison|1957|p=90}}

====Losses====
Usable nitrogen may be lost from soils when it is in the form of nitrate, as it is easily [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]]. Further losses of nitrogen occur by denitrification, the process whereby soil bacteria convert nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) to nitrogen gas, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This occurs when poor [[soil aeration]] limits free oxygen, forcing bacteria to use the oxygen in nitrate for their respiratory process. Denitrification increases when oxidisable organic material is available and when soils are warm and slightly acidic. Denitrification may vary throughout a soil as the aeration varies from place to place. Denitrification may cause the loss of 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;percent of the available nitrates within a day and when conditions are favourable to that process, losses of up to 60&amp;nbsp;percent of nitrate applied as fertiliser may occur.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=130}}

''Ammonium volatilisation'' occurs when ammonium reacts chemically with an alkaline soil, converting NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The application of ammonium fertiliser to such a field can result in volatilisation losses of as much as 30 percent.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=131}}

===Phosphorus===
After nitrogen, phosphorus is probably the element most likely to be deficient in soils. The soil mineral [[apatite]] is the most common mineral source of phosphorus. While there is on average 1000&amp;nbsp;lb of phosphorus per acre in the soil, it is generally in the form of phosphates with low solubility. Total phosphorus is about 0.1&amp;nbsp;percent by weight of the soil, but only one percent of that is available. Of the part available, more than half comes from the mineralisation of organic matter. Agricultural fields may need to be fertilised to make up for the phosphorus that has been removed in the crop.{{sfn|Olsen|Fried|1957|p=96}}

When phosphorus does form solubilised ions of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, they rapidly form insoluble phosphates of calcium or hydrous oxides of iron and aluminum. Phosphorus is largely immobile in the soil and is not leached but actually builds up in the surface layer if not cropped. The application of soluble fertilisers to soils may result in zinc deficiencies as zinc phosphates form. Conversely, the application of zinc to soils may immobilise phosphorus again as zinc phosphate. Lack of phosphorus may interfere with the normal opening of the plant leaf stomata, resulting in plant temperatures 10 percent higher than normal. Phosphorus is most available when soil pH is 6.5 in mineral soils and 5.5 in organic soils.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=131}}

===Potassium===
The amount of potassium in a soil may be as much as 80,000&amp;nbsp;lb per acre-foot, of which only 150&amp;nbsp;lb is available for plant growth. Common mineral sources of potassium are the mica [[biotite]] and potassium feldspar, KAlSi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. When solubilised, half will be held as exchangeable cations on clay while the other half is in the soil water solution. Potassium fixation often occurs when soils dry and the potassium is bonded between layers of illite clay. Under certain conditions, dependent on the soil texture, intensity of drying, and initial amount of exchangeable potassium, the fixed percentage may be as much as 90&amp;nbsp;percent within ten minutes. Potassium may be leached from soils low in clay.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=134–35}}{{sfn|Reitemeier|1957|pp=101–04}}

===Calcium===
Calcium is one percent by weight of soils and is generally available but may be low as it is soluble and can be leached. It is thus low in sandy and heavily leached soil or strongly acidic mineral soil. Calcium is supplied to the plant in the form of exchangeable ions and moderately soluble minerals. Calcium is more available on the soil colloids than is potassium because the common mineral calcite, CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is more soluble than potassium-bearing minerals.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=135–36}}

===Magnesium===
Magnesium is one of the dominant exchangeable cations in most soils (as are calcium and potassium). Primary minerals that weather to release magnesium include [[hornblende]], [[biotite]] and [[vermiculite]]. Soil magnesium concentrations are generally sufficient for optimal plant growth, but highly weathered and sandy soils may be magnesium deficient due to leaching by heavy precipitation.&lt;ref name="Roy2006Chapter4" /&gt;{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=136}}

===Sulfur===
Most sulfur is made available to plants, like phosphorus, by its release from decomposing organic matter.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=136}} Deficiencies may exist in some soils (especially sandy soils) and if cropped, sulfur needs to be added. The application of large quantities of nitrogen to fields that have marginal amounts of sulfur may cause sulfur deficiency in the rapidly growing plants by the plant's growth outpacing the supply of sulfur. A 15-ton crop of onions uses up to 19&amp;nbsp;lb of sulfur and 4&amp;nbsp;tons of alfalfa uses 15&amp;nbsp;lb per acre. Sulfur abundance varies with depth. In a sample of soils in Ohio, United States, the sulfur abundance varied with depths, 0-6&amp;nbsp;inches, 6-12&amp;nbsp;inches, 12-18&amp;nbsp;inches, 18-24&amp;nbsp;inches in the amounts: 1056, 830, 686, 528&amp;nbsp;lb per acre respectively.{{sfn|Jordan|Reisenauer|1957|p=107}}

===Micronutrients===
The micronutrients essential in plant life, in their order of importance, include  [[iron]],{{sfn|Holmes|Brown|1957|pp=111}} [[manganese]],{{sfn|Sherman|1957|p=135}} [[zinc]],{{sfn|Seatz|Jurinak|1957|p=115}} [[copper]],{{sfn|Reuther|1957|p=128}} [[boron]],{{sfn|Russel|1957|p=121}} [[chlorine]]{{sfn|Stout|Johnson|1957|p=146}} and [[molybdenum]].{{sfn|Stout|Johnson|1957|p=141}} The term refers to plants' needs, not to their abundance in soil. They are required in very small amounts but are essential to plant health in that most are required parts of some enzyme system which speeds up plants' metabolisms. They are generally available in the mineral component of the soil, but the heavy application of phosphates can cause a deficiency in zinc and iron by the formation of insoluble zinc and iron phosphates. Iron deficiency may also result from excessive amounts of heavy metals or calcium minerals (lime) in the soil. Excess amounts of soluble boron, molybdenum and chloride are toxic.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=136–37}}{{sfn|Stout|Johnson|1957|p=107}}

===Non-essential nutrients===
Nutrients which enhance the health but whose deficiency does not stop the life cycle of plants include: [[cobalt]], [[strontium]], [[vanadium]], [[silicon]] and [[nickel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Faria Pereira|first1=B.F.|title=Nutrients and Nonessential Elements in Soil after 11 Years of Wastewater Irrigation|url=https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/41/3/920|website=ACSESS Digital Library|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As their importance are evaluated they may be added to the list of essential plant nutrients.

==Soil organic matter==
{{main|Soil organic matter}}
Soil organic matter is made up of [[organic compounds]] and includes plant, animal and microbial material, both living and dead. A typical soil has a biomass composition of 70% microorganisms, 22% macrofauna, and 8% roots. The living component of an acre of soil may include 900&amp;nbsp;lb of earthworms, 2400&amp;nbsp;lb of fungi, 1500&amp;nbsp;lb of bacteria, 133&amp;nbsp;lb of protozoa and 890&amp;nbsp;lb of arthropods and algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pimentel, D.|display-authors=etal|year=1995|title=Environmental and economic costs of soil erosion and conservation benefits|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=267|pages=1117–22|bibcode = 1995Sci...267.1117P |doi = 10.1126/science.267.5201.1117|issue=24|pmid=17789193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small part of the organic matter consists of the living cells such as bacteria, molds, and actinomycetes that work to break down the dead organic matter. Were it not for the action of these micro-organisms, the entire carbon dioxide part of the atmosphere would be sequestered as organic matter in the soil.

Chemically, organic matter is classed as follows:

# Polysaccharides
## cellulose
## hemicellulose
## starch
## pectin
# Lignins
# Proteins

Most living things in soils, including plants, insects, bacteria, and fungi, are dependent on organic matter for nutrients and/or energy. Soils have organic compounds in varying degrees of decomposition which rate is dependent on the temperature, soil moisture, and aeration. Bacteria and fungi feed on the raw organic matter, which are fed upon by amoebas, which in turn are fed upon by nematodes and arthropods. Organic matter holds soils open, allowing the infiltration of air and water, and may hold as much as twice its weight in water. Many soils, including desert and rocky-gravel soils, have little or no organic matter. Soils that are all organic matter, such as [[peat]] ([[histosols]]), are infertile.&lt;ref name=Foth1984&gt;{{Cite book | last = Foth | first = Henry D. | year = 1984 | title = Fundamentals of soil science | page = 151 | isbn = 978-0471889267 | publisher = Wiley | location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its earliest stage of decomposition, the original organic material is often called raw organic matter. The final stage of decomposition is called humus.

In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

===Humus===
[[Humus]] refers to organic matter that has been decomposed by soil flora and fauna to the point where it is resistant to further breakdown. Humus usually constitutes only five percent of the soil or less by volume, but it is an essential source of nutrients and adds important textural qualities crucial to [[soil health]] and plant growth. Humus also hold bits of undecomposed organic matter which feed arthropods and worms which further improve the soil. The end product, humus, is soluble in water and forms a weak acid that can attack silicate minerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilluly, Waters, Woodford|title=Principles of Geology|year=1975|edition=4th|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=USA|isbn=978-0716702696|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humus is a colloid with a high cation and anion exchange capacity that on a dry weight basis is many times greater than that of clay colloids. It also acts as a buffer, like clay, against changes in pH and soil moisture.

[[Humic acid]]s and [[fulvic acid]]s, which begin as raw organic matter, are important constituents of humus. After the death of plants and animals, microbes begin to feed on the residues, resulting finally in the formation of humus. With decomposition, there is a reduction of water-soluble constituents, [[cellulose]] and [[hemicellulose]], and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. As the residues break down, only stable molecules made of aromatic carbon rings, oxygen and hydrogen remain in the form of [[humin]], [[lignin]] and lignin complexes collectively called humus. While the structure of humus has few nutrients, it is able to attract and hold cation and anion nutrients by weak bonds that can be released into the soil solution in response to changes in soil pH.

Lignin is resistant to breakdown and accumulates within the soil. It also reacts with amino acids, which further increases its resistance to decomposition, including enzymatic decomposition by microbes. [[Fat]]s and [[wax]]es from plant matter have some resistance to decomposition and persist in soils for a while. Clay soils often have higher organic contents that persist longer than soils without clay as the organic molecules adhere to and are stabilised by the clay. Proteins normally decompose readily, but when bound to clay particles, they become more resistant to decomposition. Clay particles also absorb the enzymes exuded by microbes which would normally break down proteins. The addition of organic matter to clay soils can render that organic matter and any added nutrients inaccessible to plants and microbes for many years. High soil [[tannin]] ([[polyphenol]]) content can cause nitrogen to be sequestered in proteins or cause nitrogen immobilisation.&lt;ref name=Verkaik2006&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verkaik |first=Eric |last2=Jongkind |first2=Anne G. |last3=Berendse |first3=Frank |date=2006 |title=Short-term and long-term effects of tannins on nitrogen mineralization and litter decomposition in kauri (Agathis australis (D. Don) Lindl.) forests |journal=Plant and Soil |volume=287 |pages=337–45 |doi=10.1007/s11104-006-9081-8 |url=http://edepot.wur.nl/25615 |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fierer2001&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fierer |first=N. |last2=Schimel |first2=Joshua P. |last3=Cates |first3=Rex G. |last4=Zou |first4=Jiping |title=Influence of balsam poplar tannin fractions on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in Alaskan taiga floodplain soils |journal=Soil Biology and Biochemistry |date=2001 |volume=33 |pages=1827–39 |doi=10.1016/S0038-0717(01)00111-0 |issue=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Humus formation is a process dependent on the amount of plant material added each year and the type of base soil. Both are affected by climate and the type of organisms present. Soils with humus can vary in nitrogen content but typically have 3 to 6&amp;nbsp;percent nitrogen. Raw organic matter, as a reserve of nitrogen and phosphorus, is a vital component affecting [[Fertile soil|soil fertility]].&lt;ref name="Foth1984"/&gt; Humus also absorbs water, and expands and shrinks between dry and wet states, increasing soil [[porosity]]. Humus is less stable than the soil's mineral constituents, as it is reduced by microbial decomposition, and over time its concentration diminshes without the addition of new organic matter. However, humus may persist over centuries if not millennia.

===Climatological influence===

==Horizons==
{{Main|Soil horizon}}

A horizontal layer of the soil, whose physical features, composition and age are distinct from those above and beneath, is referred to as a [[soil horizon]]. The naming of a horizon is based on the type of material of which it is composed. Those materials reflect the duration of specific processes of soil formation. They are labelled using a shorthand notation of letters and numbers&lt;ref name=Retallack1990&gt;{{Cite book| last = Retallack | first = G.

Some may have only one horizon.

The exposure of parent material to favourable conditions produces mineral soils that are marginally suitable for plant growth. That growth often results in the accumulation of organic residues. The accumulated organic layer called the [[forest floor|O horizon]] produces a more active soil due to the effect of the organisms that live within it. Organisms colonise and break down organic materials, making available nutrients upon which other plants and animals can live. After sufficient time, humus moves downward and is deposited in a distinctive organic surface layer called the A horizon.

==Classification==
{{main|Soil classification}}

Soil is classified into categories in order to understand relationships between different soils and to determine the suitability of a soil for a particular use. One of the first classification systems was developed by Russian scientist [[Dokuchaev]] around 1880. It was modified a number of times by American and European researchers, and developed into the system commonly used until the 1960s. It was based on the idea that soils have a particular morphology based on the materials and factors that form them. In the 1960s, a different classification system began to emerge which focused on [[soil morphology]] instead of parental materials and soil-forming factors. Since then it has undergone further modifications. The [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources]] (WRB)&lt;ref name=IUSS2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=IUSS Working Group WRB|title=World Reference Base for Soil Resources 2014.

====United States====
{{Main|USDA soil taxonomy#Orders}}

A taxonomy is an arrangement in a systematic manner; the  [[USDA soil taxonomy]] has six levels of classification. They are, from most general to specific: order, suborder, great group, subgroup, family and series. Soil properties that can be measured quantitatively are used in this classification system – they include: depth, moisture, temperature, texture, structure, cation exchange capacity, base saturation, clay mineralogy, organic matter content and salt content. There are 12 soil orders (the top hierarchical level) in soil taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evsc.virginia.edu/~alm7d/soils/soilordr.html The Soil Orders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112143347/http://www.evsc.virginia.edu/~alm7d/soils/soilordr.html |date=12 January 2010 }}, Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Virginia, retrieved 23 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=411–32}}  The names of the orders end with the suffix ''-sol''. The criteria for the different soil orders include properties that reflect major differences in the genesis of soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Soil Survey Staff|title=Soil taxonomy: A Basic System of Soil Classification for Making and Interpreting Soil Surveys. 2nd edition.

* [[Alfisol]] – soils with [[aluminium]] and [[iron]]. They have horizons of clay accumulation, and form where there is enough moisture and warmth for at least three months of plant growth. They constitute 10% of soils worldwide.
* [[Andisol]] – volcanic ash soils. They are young and very fertile. They cover 1% of the world's ice-free surface.
* [[Aridisol]] – dry soils forming under [[desert]] conditions which have fewer than 90 consecutive days of moisture during the growing season and are nonleached. They include nearly 12% of soils on Earth. Soil formation is slow, and accumulated organic matter is scarce. They may have subsurface zones of [[caliche]] or [[duripan]]. Many aridisols have well-developed Bt horizons showing clay movement from past periods of greater moisture.
* [[Entisol]] – recently formed soils that lack well-developed horizons. Commonly found on unconsolidated river and beach sediments of sand and clay or volcanic ash, some have an A horizon on top of bedrock. They are 18% of soils worldwide.
* [[Gelisol]] – permafrost soils with permafrost within two metres of the surface or gelic materials and permafrost within one metre. They constitute 9% of soils worldwide.
* [[Histosol]] – organic soils, formerly called bog soils, are 1% of soils worldwide.
* [[Inceptisol]] – young soils. They have subsurface horizon formation but show little eluviation and illuviation. They constitute 15% of soils worldwide.
* [[Mollisol]] – soft, deep, dark fertile soil formed in grasslands and some hardwood forests with very thick A horizons. They are 7% of soils worldwide.
* [[Oxisol]] – are heavily [[weathered]], are rich in iron and aluminum oxides ([[sesquioxides]]) or [[kaolin]] but low in [[silica]]. They have only trace nutrients due to heavy tropical rainfall and high temperatures and low [[Cation-exchange capacity|CEC]] of the remaining clays. They are 8% of soils worldwide.
* [[Spodosol]] – acid soils with organic colloid layer complexed with iron and aluminium leached from a layer above. They are typical soils of [[coniferous]] and [[deciduous forest]]s in cooler climates. They constitute 4% of soils worldwide.
* [[Ultisol]] – acid soils in the humid tropics and subtropics, which are depleted in [[calcium]], [[magnesium]] and [[potassium]] (important [[Plant nutrition|plant nutrients]]). They are highly [[weathered]], but not as weathered as Oxisols. They make up 8% of the soil worldwide.
* [[Vertisol]] – inverted soils. They are clay-rich and tend to swell when wet and shrink upon drying, often forming deep cracks into which surface layers can fall. They are difficult to farm or to construct roads and buildings due to their high expansion rate. They constitute 2% of soils worldwide.

"Soils of Mountains", which constitute the balance (11.6%), have a mixture of those listed above, or are classified as "Rugged Mountains" which have no soil.

The above soil orders in sequence of increasing degree of development are Entisols, Inceptisols, Aridisols, Mollisols, Alfisols, Spodosols, Ultisols, and Oxisols. Histosols and Vertisols may appear in any of the above at any time during their development.

The '''soil suborders''' within an order are differentiated on the basis of soil properties and horizons which depend on soil moisture and temperature. Forty-seven suborders are recognized in the United States.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=409}}

The '''soil great group''' category is a subdivision of a suborder in which the kind and sequence of soil horizons distinguish one soil from another. About 185 great groups are recognized in the United States. Horizons marked by clay, iron, humus and hard pans and soil features such as the expansion-contraction of clays (that produce self-mixing provided by clay), temperature, and marked quantities of various salts are used as distinguishing features.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=409}}

The great group categories are divided into three kinds of '''soil subgroups''': typic, intergrade and extragrade. A typic subgroup represents the basic or 'typical' concept of the great group to which the described subgroup belongs. An intergrade subgroup describes the properties that suggest how it grades towards (is similar to) soils of other soil great groups, suborders or orders. These properties are not developed or expressed well enough to cause the soil to be included within the great group towards which they grade, but suggest similarities. Extragrade features are aberrant properties which prevent that soil from being included in another soil classification. About 1,000 soil subgroups are defined in the United States.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=409}}

A '''soil family''' category is a group of soils within a subgroup and describes the physical and chemical properties which affect the response of soil to agricultural management and engineering applications. The principal characteristics used to differentiate soil families include texture, mineralogy, pH, permeability, structure, consistency, the locale's precipitation pattern, and soil temperature. For some soils the criteria also specify the percentage of silt, sand and coarse fragments such as gravel, cobbles and rocks. About 4,500 soil families are recognised in the United States.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|pp=409–10}}

A family may contain several '''soil series''' which describe the physical location using the name of a prominent physical feature such as a river or town near where the soil sample was taken. An example would be Merrimac for the [[Merrimack River]] in New Hampshire. More than 14,000 soil series are recognised in the United States. This permits very specific descriptions of soils.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=410}}

A '''soil phase of series''', originally called 'soil type' describes the soil surface texture, slope, stoniness, saltiness, erosion, and other conditions.{{sfn|Donahue|Miller|Shickluna|1977|p=410}}

==Uses==
Soil is used in agriculture, where it serves as the anchor and primary nutrient base for plants; however, as demonstrated by [[hydroponics]], it is not essential to plant growth if the soil-contained nutrients can be dissolved in a solution. The types of soil and available moisture determine the species of plants that can be cultivated.

Soil material is also a critical component in the mining, construction and landscape development industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Soils for Landscape Development |author1=Leake, Simon|author2=Haege, Elke|publisher=CSIRO Publishing|year=2014|isbn=978-0643109643}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soil serves as a foundation for most construction projects. The movement of massive volumes of soil can be involved in [[surface mining]], road building and dam construction. [[Earth sheltering]] is the architectural practice of using soil for external [[thermal mass]] against building walls. Many [[building material]]s are soil based.

Soil resources are critical to the environment, as well as to food and fibre production. Soil provides minerals and water to plants. Soil absorbs rainwater and releases it later, thus preventing floods and drought. Soil cleans water as it percolates through it. Soil is the habitat for many organisms: the major part of known and unknown [[biodiversity]] is in the soil, in the form of [[invertebrates]] ([[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]], [[millipede]]s, [[centipede]]s, [[snail]]s, [[slug]]s, [[mite]]s, [[springtail]]s, [[Enchytraeidae|enchytraeids]], [[nematode]]s, [[protist]]s), [[bacteria]], [[archaea]], fungi and [[algae]]; and most organisms living above ground have part of them ([[plants]]) or spend part of their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] ([[insects]]) below-ground. Above-ground and below-ground biodiversities are tightly interconnected,&lt;ref name="Ponge2003"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ponge| first = Jean-François| year = 2003| title = Humus forms in terrestrial ecosystems: a framework to biodiversity| journal = Soil Biology and Biochemistry| volume = 35| issue = 7| pages = 935–45| doi = 10.1016/S0038-0717(03)00149-4| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222567430| format = PDF| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160129153903/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222567430| archivedate = 29 January 2016| df = dmy-all| citeseerx = 10.1.1.467.4937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="De Deyn2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last=De Deyn |first=Gerlinde B. |last2=Van der Putten |first2=Wim H. |date=2005 |title=Linking aboveground and belowground diversity |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=20 |pages=625–33 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.08.009 |pmid=16701446 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; making soil protection of paramount importance for any restoration or conservation plan.

The biological component of soil is an extremely important carbon sink since about 57% of the biotic content is carbon. Even on desert crusts, cyanobacteria, lichens and mosses capture and sequester a significant amount of carbon by photosynthesis. Poor farming and grazing methods have degraded soils and released much of this sequestered carbon to the atmosphere. Restoring the world's soils could offset the effect of increases in [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and slow global warming, while improving crop yields and reducing water needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Hansen, J. |display-authors = etal |journal=Open Atmospheric Science Journal|year=2008|volume= 2|issue = 1 |pages= 217–31 | title=Target atmospheric CO2: Where should humanity aim?|arxiv = 0804.1126 |bibcode = 2008OASJ....2..217H |doi = 10.2174/1874282300802010217|postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[Waste management]] often has a soil component. [[Septic drain field]]s treat [[septic tank]] effluent using aerobic soil processes. [[Landfill]]s use soil for [[daily cover]]. Land application of waste water relies on soil biology to aerobically treat [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]].

Organic soils, especially [[peat]], serve as a significant fuel resource; but wide areas of peat production, such as [[sphagnum]] [[bog]]s, are now protected because of patrimonial interest.

[[Geophagy]] is the practice of eating soil-like substances. Both animals and human cultures occasionally consume soil for medicinal, recreational, or religious purposes.

Soils are often initially acid because their [[parent material]]s were acid and initially low in the [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] [[cation]]s ([[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[potassium]] and [[sodium]]). Acidification occurs when these elements are leached from the soil profile by rainfall or by the harvesting of forest or agricultural crops. Soil acidification is accelerated by the use of acid-forming [[nitrogenous fertilizer]]s and by the effects of [[acid precipitation]].

[[Soil contamination]] at low levels is often within a soil's capacity to treat and assimilate waste material. Soil biota can treat waste by transforming it; soil colloids can adsorb the waste material. Many waste treatment processes rely on this treatment capacity. Exceeding treatment capacity can damage soil biota and limit soil function. Derelict soils occur where industrial contamination or other development activity damages the soil to such a degree that the land cannot be used safely or productively. [[Environmental remediation|Remediation]] of derelict soil uses principles of geology, physics, chemistry and biology to degrade, attenuate, isolate or remove soil contaminants to restore [[soil functions]] and values. Techniques include leaching, air sparging, chemical amendments, [[phytoremediation]], [[bioremediation]] and natural degradation.

[[Desertification]] is an environmental process of ecosystem degradation in arid and semi-arid regions, often caused by human activity. It is a common misconception that [[drought]]s cause desertification. Droughts are common in arid and semiarid lands. Well-managed lands can recover from drought when the rains return. Soil management tools include maintaining soil nutrient and organic matter levels, reduced tillage and increased cover. These practices help to control erosion and maintain productivity during periods when moisture is available. Continued land abuse during droughts, however, increases land degradation. Increased population and livestock pressure on marginal lands accelerates desertification.

[[Erosion]] of soil is caused by [[Water erosion#Rainfall|water]], [[Water erosion#Wind erosion|wind]], [[Water erosion#Glaciers|ice]], and [[Water erosion#Mass movement|movement in response to gravity]]. More than one kind of erosion can occur simultaneously. Erosion is distinguished from [[weathering]], since erosion also transports eroded soil away from its place of origin (soil in transit may be described as [[sediment]]). Erosion is an intrinsic natural process, but in many places it is greatly increased by human activity, especially poor [[land use]] practices. These include [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities which leave the soil bare during times of heavy rain or strong winds, [[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], and improper [[construction]] activity. Improved management can limit erosion. [[Soil conservation#Erosion prevention|Soil conservation techniques]] which are employed include changes of land use (such as replacing erosion-prone [[crop]]s with [[grass]] or other soil-binding plants), changes to the timing or type of agricultural operations, [[Terrace (agriculture)|terrace]] building, use of erosion-suppressing cover materials (including [[Cover crop#Water management|cover crops]] and [[Soil bioengineering#Technical functions|other plants]]), limiting disturbance during construction, and avoiding construction during erosion-prone periods.

A serious and long-running water erosion problem occurs in [[China]], on the middle reaches of the [[Yellow River]] and the upper reaches of the [[Yangtze River]]. From the Yellow River, over 1.6&amp;nbsp;billion tons of sediment flow each year into the ocean. The [[sediment]] originates primarily from water erosion (gully erosion) in the [[Loess Plateau]] region of northwest China.

Soil piping is a particular form of soil erosion that occurs below the soil surface. It causes levee and dam failure, as well as [[Sinkhole|sink hole]] formation. Turbulent flow removes soil starting at the mouth of the seep flow and the subsoil erosion advances up-gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jones | first = j. a. a. | title = Soil piping and stream channel initiation | journal = Water Resources Research | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 602–10 | year = 1976 | doi = 10.1029/WR007i003p00602 | postscript = . | bibcode=1971WRR.....7..602J}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term sand boil is used to describe the appearance of the discharging end of an active soil pipe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Soil salination]] is the accumulation of free [[salt]]s to such an extent that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. [[Surface irrigation|Irrigation]] of arid lands is especially problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = ILRI | title = Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review | series = In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) | year = 1989 | pages = 18–34 | location = Wageningen, The Netherlands | url = http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf | format = pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090219070320/http://waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf | archivedate = 19 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and overirrigation in the field, often raises the underlying [[water table]]. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the [[capillary fringe]] of saline groundwater. [[Soil salinity control]] involves [[watertable control]] and [[leaching model|flushing]] with higher levels of applied water in combination with [[tile drainage]] or another form of [[Drainage system (agriculture)|subsurface drainage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Drainage Manual: A Guide to Integrating Plant, Soil, and Water Relationships for Drainage of Irrigated Lands | year = 1993 | publisher = Interior Dept., Bureau of Reclamation | isbn = 978-0160616235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waterlog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlog.info |title=Free articles and software on drainage of waterlogged land and soil salinity control |accessdate=28 July 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816225219/http://www.waterlog.info/ |archivedate=16 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reclamation==
Soils which contain high levels of particular clays, such as [[smectite]]s, are often very fertile. For example, the smectite-rich clays of Thailand's [[Central Thailand|Central Plains]] are among the most productive in the world.

Many farmers in tropical areas, however, struggle to retain organic matter in the soils they work. In recent years, for example, productivity has declined in the low-clay soils of northern Thailand. Farmers initially responded by adding organic matter from termite mounds, but this was unsustainable in the long-term. Scientists experimented with adding [[bentonite]], one of the smectite family of clays, to the soil. In field trials, conducted by scientists from the [[International Water Management Institute]] in cooperation with [[Khon Kaen University]] and local farmers, this had the effect of helping retain water and nutrients. Supplementing the farmer's usual practice with a single application of 200&amp;nbsp;kg bentonite per rai (6.26 rai = 1 hectare) resulted in an average yield increase of 73%. More work showed that applying bentonite to degraded sandy soils reduced the risk of crop failure during drought years.

In 2008, three years after the initial trials, [[International Water Management Institute|IWMI]] scientists conducted a survey among 250 farmers in northeast Thailand, half of whom had applied bentonite to their fields. The average improvement for those using the clay addition was 18% higher than for non-clay users. Using the clay had enabled some farmers to switch to growing vegetables, which need more fertile soil. This helped to increase their income. The researchers estimated that 200 farmers in northeast Thailand and 400 in Cambodia had adopted the use of clays, and that a further 20,000 farmers were introduced to the new technique.&lt;ref name="Water Management Institute2010"&gt;{{cite journal |year=2010 |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |title=Improving soils and boosting yields in Thailand |doi=10.5337/2011.0031 |journal=Success Stories |issue=2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607030912/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Success_Stories/PDF/2010/Issue%202%20-%20Improving_soils_and_boosting_yields_in_Thailand.pdf |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df=dmy-all |author=International Water Management Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the soil is too high in clay, adding gypsum, washed river sand and organic matter will balance the composition. Adding organic matter (like [[ramial chipped wood]] for instance) to soil which is depleted in nutrients and too high in sand will boost its quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Provide for your garden's basic needs ... and the plants will take it from there|date=10 March 2011|journal=USA Weekend|url=http://www.usaweekend.com/article/20110311/HOME04/103130305|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130209012951/http://www.usaweekend.com/article/20110311/HOME04/103130305|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stringer v Peat Marwick Mitchell &amp; Co''' [2000] 1 NZLR 450 is a cited case in New Zealand regarding liability for negligent misstatements &lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Stringer was a partner at a law firm where it was discovered that a fellow partner had embezzled 1 million dollars from the firm, which had gone unnoticed by the auditors [[Peat Marwick]]

Stringer sued the auditors for negligence for the loss.

Peat Marwick argued that they were hired by the [[New Zealand Law Society]] and not by the law firm itself, although the law firm did pay for their audit fees.

==Held==
The court held that despite the primary purpose of the auditing was to protect the firms clients, they were also protecting the partnership's interests as well, meaning that they were liable for the partners losses from the fraud. The court did say however, that they could possibly mitigate the amount of damages through contributory negligence, if the partners were negligent as well.

'''''The Caine Mutiny''''' is the 1951 [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction|Pulitzer Prize]]–winning novel by [[Herman Wouk]]. The novel grew out of Wouk's personal experiences aboard a [[Destroyer minesweeper|destroyer-minesweeper]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theater]] in [[World War II]]. Among its themes, it deals with the moral and ethical decisions made at [[sea]] by ship captains. The mutiny of the title is legalistic, not violent, and takes place during [[Typhoon Cobra]], in December 1944. The [[court-martial]] that results provides the dramatic climax to the plot.

==Plot summary==

[[File:USS Billingsley (DD-293).jpg|thumb|A {{sclass-|Clemson|destroyer|1}}. ''Caine'' would have looked like this, but with the rearmost funnel removed.]]
The story is told through the eyes of Willis Seward "Willie" Keith, an affluent, callow young man who signs up for [[Midshipman#United States Navy and Marine Corps|midshipman school]] with the [[United States Navy]] to avoid being drafted into the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. The novel describes the tribulations he endures because of inner conflicts over his relationship with his domineering mother and with May Wynn, a beautiful red-haired [[nightclub singer]], the daughter of Italian immigrants. After barely surviving a series of misadventures that earn him the highest number of demerits in his midshipman's class, he is commissioned as an ensign and assigned to the [[destroyer minesweeper]] USS ''Caine'', an obsolete warship converted from a [[World War I]]-era destroyer.

Willie, with a low opinion of the ways of the Navy, misses his ship when it leaves on a combat assignment, and rather than catch up with it, ducks his duties to play piano for an [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] who has taken a shine to him. He has second thoughts after reading a last letter from his father, who has died of [[melanoma]], but soon forgets his guilt in the round of parties at the admiral's house. Eventually, he reports aboard ''Caine''. Although the ship has successfully carried out its combat missions in Willie's absence, the [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] immediately disapproves of its decaying condition and slovenly crew, which he attributes to a slackness of discipline by the ship's longtime captain, [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] William De Vriess.

Willie's lackadaisical attitude toward what he considers menial duties brings about a humiliating clash with De Vriess when Willie forgets to decode a communications message which serves notice that De Vriess will soon be relieved. While Willie is still pouting over his punishment, De Vriess is relieved by Lieutenant Commander Philip Francis Queeg, a strong, by-the-book figure, whom Willie at first believes to be just what the rusty ''Caine'' and its rough-necked crew needs. But Queeg has never handled a ship like this before, and he soon makes errors, to which he is unwilling to admit. ''Caine'' is sent to [[San Francisco]] for an overhaul, in an admiral's hope that the captain will make further mistakes someplace else. Before the ship departs, Queeg browbeats his officers into selling their liquor rations to him. In a breach of regulations, Queeg smuggles the liquor off the ship, and when it is lost, [[blackmail]]s Willie into paying for it. Willie sees May on leave, and after sleeping with her, decides he has no future with a woman of a lower social class. He resolves to let the relationship die by not replying to her letters.

As ''Caine'' begins its missions under his command, Queeg loses the respect of the crew and loyalty of the wardroom through a series of incidents. Tensions aboard the ship cause Queeg to isolate himself from the other officers, who snub him as unworthy, believing him an oppressive coward. Queeg is dubbed "Old Yellowstain" by the officers following the [[Battle of Kwajalein|invasion of Kwajalein]]. Ordered to escort low-lying [[landing craft]] to their line of departure, '' Caine'' instead drops a yellow dye marker to mark the spot, and hastily leaves the battle area.

Communications officer [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Thomas Keefer, an intellectual and initially a sympathetic character, plants the suggestion that Queeg might be mentally ill in the mind of ''Caine''{{'}}s executive officer, Lieutenant Stephen Maryk. He steers Maryk to "Section 184" of the [[United States Navy Regulations|Navy Regulations]], according to which a subordinate can relieve a commanding officer in extraordinary circumstances.

Maryk keeps a secret log of Queeg's eccentric behavior and decides to bring it to the attention of Admiral [[William F. Halsey|Halsey]], commanding the [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]]. Keefer reluctantly supports Maryk, then gets cold feet and backs out, warning Maryk that his actions will be seen as [[mutiny]]. Soon after, ''Caine'' is caught in the path of a [[Typhoon Cobra (1944)|typhoon]], an ordeal that sinks three destroyers. At the height of the storm, Queeg's paralysis of action convinces Maryk that he must relieve the captain of command to prevent the loss of the ship. Willie Keith, as [[Officer of the Deck]], supports the decision. Maryk turns ''Caine'' into the wind and rides out the storm.

Maryk is tried by [[court-martial]] for "[[general article (military law)|conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline]]" instead of "making a mutiny". Willie and Stilwell, the enlisted [[helmsman]] during the typhoon, are to be tried depending on the outcome of Maryk's trial. In the courtroom, Keefer distances himself from any responsibility for the relief. Lieutenant Barney Greenwald, a [[naval aviator]] who was an attorney in civilian life, is appointed to represent Maryk. His opinion, after the captain was found to be sane by three Navy [[Psychiatry|psychiatrists]], is that Maryk was legally unjustified in relieving Queeg. Despite his own disgust with Maryk's and Willie's actions, Greenwald decides to take the case after deducing Keefer's role.

During the trial, Greenwald unrelentingly cross-examines Queeg until he is overcome by the stress. Greenwald's tactic of attacking Queeg results in Maryk's acquittal and the dropping of charges against Willie. Maryk, who had aspired to a career in the [[Unrestricted Line Officer|regular navy]], is later sent to command a [[Landing Craft Infantry]], a humiliation which ends his naval career ambitions, while Queeg is transferred to a naval supply depot in Iowa.

At a party celebrating both the acquittal and Keefer's success at selling his novel to a publisher, an intoxicated Greenwald calls Keefer a coward. He tells the gathering that he feels ashamed of having destroyed Queeg on the stand because Queeg did the necessary duty of guarding America in the peacetime Navy, which people like Keefer saw as beneath them. Greenwald asserts that men like Queeg kept Greenwald's Jewish mother from being "[[Soap made from human corpses|melted down into a bar of soap]]" by the Nazis. Greenwald had to "[[Wiktionary:torpedo#Verb|torpedo]] Queeg" because "the wrong man was on trial"—that it was Keefer, not Maryk, who was "the true author of 'The ''Caine'' Mutiny'". Greenwald throws a glass of "the [[Champagne|yellow wine]]" in Keefer's face, thereby bringing the term "Old Yellowstain" full circle back to the novelist.

Willie returns to ''Caine'' in the last days of the [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa campaign]] as its executive officer. Keefer is now the captain, and his behavior as captain is similar to Queeg's. ''Caine'' is struck by a [[kamikaze]], an event in which Willie discovers that he has matured into a naval officer. Keefer panics and orders the ship abandoned, but Willie remains aboard and rescues the situation.

Keefer is sent home after the war ends, ashamed of his cowardly behavior during the kamikaze attack. Keefer's brother Roland had died saving his ship from a kamikaze fire. Willie becomes the last captain of ''Caine''. He receives a [[Bronze Star Medal]]  for his actions following the kamikaze—and a [[letter of reprimand]] for his part in unlawfully relieving Queeg. The findings of the court-martial have been overturned after a review by higher authority. Willie agrees in retrospect that the relief was unjustified and probably unnecessary.

Willie keeps ''Caine'' afloat during another typhoon and brings it back to [[Bayonne, New Jersey]], for decommissioning after the end of the war. On reflection, he decides to ask May (now a blonde and using her real name of Marie Minotti) to marry him. However, this will not be as easy as he once thought, as she is now the girlfriend of a popular bandleader.

==Historical background==

Wouk himself served during World War II aboard two destroyer-minesweepers converted from World War I-era {{sclass-|Clemson|destroyer|2}}s, {{USS|Zane|DD-337|6}} being the first and {{USS|Southard|DD-207|6}} being the second. (Wouk uses the latter name for one of his characters in the novel, Captain Randolph Patterson Southard. In an allusion to history professor [[Jacques Barzun]] of his alma mater, [[Columbia University]], Wouk also has Queeg refer to a previous assignment he had on a ship named ''Barzun''.)

USS ''Caine'' is a fictional depiction of a DMS (destroyer-minesweeper) conversion. The ''Clemson'' class was named for Midshipman [[Henry A. Clemson]], lost at sea on 8 December 1846 during the Mexican war, when the brig {{USS|Somers|1842|6}} [[capsize]]d off [[Veracruz (city)|Vera Cruz]] in a sudden squall while chasing a [[blockade runner]]. In November 1842 ''Somers'' was the scene of the only recorded conspiracy to mutiny in U.S. Naval history when three members of the crew—a midshipman, a [[Boatswain's mate (United States Navy)|boatswain's mate]], and a [[seaman]]—were clapped in irons and subsequently hanged for planning a takeover of the vessel.

Many of the incidents and plot details are autobiographical. Like both Keefer and Willie, Wouk rose through the ship's [[wardroom]] of ''Zane'' from assistant communications officer to [[first lieutenant#U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard|first lieutenant]], and then was [[executive officer]] of ''Southard,'' recommended to captain the ship home to the United States at the end of the war before it was beached at Okinawa in a typhoon.

==Reception==

''The Caine Mutiny'' reached the top of the [[New York Times Best Seller List|''New York Times'' best seller list]] on August 12, 1951, after 17 weeks on the list, replacing ''[[From Here to Eternity (novel)|From Here to Eternity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawes.com/1951/1951-08-12.pdf ''New York Times'' best seller list of August 12, 1951]&lt;/ref&gt;  It remained atop the list for 33 weeks until March 30, 1952, when it was replaced by ''[[My Cousin Rachel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawes.com/1952/1952-03-30.pdf ''New York Times'' best seller list of March 30, 1952]&lt;/ref&gt; It moved back to first place on May 25, 1952, and remained another 15 weeks, before being supplanted by ''[[The Silver Chalice]]'', and last appeared on August 23, 1953, after 122 weeks on the list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawes.com/1953/1953-08-23.pdf ''New York Times'' best seller list of August 23, 1953]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
In 1954 [[Columbia Pictures]] released the film ''[[The Caine Mutiny (film)|The Caine Mutiny]]'' starring [[Humphrey Bogart]] as Queeg in a widely acclaimed performance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/cain.html |title=Filmsite Movie Review: The Caine Mutiny |work=Filmsite |publisher=Tim Dirks |accessdate=March 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that earned him the third and final [[Best Actor in a Leading Role|Academy Award nomination]] of his career.

After the novel's success, Wouk adapted the court-martial sequence into a full-length, two-act [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play, ''[[The Caine Mutiny Court Martial]]''. Directed by [[Charles Laughton]], it was a success on the stage in 1954, opening five months before the release of the film and starring [[Lloyd Nolan]] as Queeg, [[John Hodiak]] as Maryk, and [[Henry Fonda]] as Greenwald. It has been revived twice on Broadway, and was presented on television live in 1955, and in 1988 as a [[made-for-television]] film.

The stage script was translated into Chinese in 1988 by [[Ying Ruocheng]], a famous Chinese actor, director, playwright and Vice Minister of Culture. At Ying's invitation, [[Charlton Heston]] directed the translated play in a successful run at the [[Beijing People's Art Theatre]], opening on October 18, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.douban.com/location/drama/10863576/ | title = The Caine Mutiny Court Martial (Chinese Version) }}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was revived in 2006, again under Heston, and has been revived there twice more (2009, 2012) since his death.

'''The Final Rule''' is a national policy in the [[United States]] that dictates the protocol for all cadaveric [[organ donation]]. The Final Rule replaced a variety of local and regional protocol with a unified policy for the first time. It also increased [[Department of Health and Human Services]]' control of organ donation.

The Final Rule was issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and dictates the process to be taken by organ procurement organizations in conjunction with [[United Network for Organ Sharing]] to match donors with potential recipients.The Final Rule dramatically changed the way organ donations were allocated in the United States, moving away from a system that favored geographic areas with large donor banks towards a system that prioritized a patient's need for organ transplant over their proximity to the donor. This move reflects increased ability to successfully preserve and transfer organs for [[Organ transplantation]] farther than was previously possible. This move was controversial among areas with larger donor banks because there were concerns that the rule would disincentivize organ donation. Donor banks believed donors would be less likely to donate if the organs were being transferred out of state.&lt;ref&gt;Grantham D. Transforming transplantation: the effect of the health and human services final rule on the organ allocation system. 35 U.S.F. L. Rev. 2001; 751: 752.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally proposed in 1998, the Final Rule was not implemented until March 2000. Implementation was delayed in order to collect public input and due to lawsuits including two brought by the State of Wisconsin and State of New Jersey seeking injunctive relief from the ruling. The Final Rule as it stands today allows for local recipients to be considered first but directs organ procurement organizations to offer organs nationally if a local match cannot be made, taking urgency of need into account. 
The current ruling also gives DHHS veto power over any policies created by the [[Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network]], administered by the [[United Network for Organ Sharing]], increasing the direct role of DHHS in organ donation.&lt;ref&gt;National Organ Allocation Policy: The Final Rule: Virtual Mentor: American Medical Association Journal of Ethics: http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2005/09/hlaw1-0509.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tort law}}
[[File:Auction-storage-no-trespassing-sign-tn1.jpg|thumbnail|"Trespassers will be shot" sign]]
{{wiktionary}}

In the [[law]] of [[tort]], [[property]], and [[criminal law]] a '''trespasser''' is a person who commits the act of [[trespassing]] on a property, that is, without the permission of the owner. Being present on land as a trespasser thereto creates liability in the trespasser, so long as the trespass is intentional. At the same time, the status of a visitor as a trespasser (as opposed to an [[invitee]] or a [[licensee]]) defines the legal rights of the visitor if they are injured due to the [[negligence]] of the property owner.

==Trespassing as a tort==
The tort of trespass to land requires an intentional physical invasion of the [[plaintiff]]'s [[real property]] by the defendant or a refusal to leave when ordered to leave.

===Intent required===
For example, a person walking in a public park who trips and rolls down a hill will not be liable for trespass just because the bottom of the hill is on private land.

===Physical invasion===
The trespasser need not enter the land in person. Indeed, if A and B are standing next to C's land, and A pushes B onto the land without entering it himself, it is A (and not B, who did not intend to enter that space) who is liable for the trespass to C's land. There must be some physical entry, however. Causing noise, light, odors, or smoke to enter the land of another is not a trespass, but is instead a different tort, [[nuisance]].

For purposes of determining liability, the landowner's property rights extend above and below the land to as much distance as the landowner can beneficially use. Even a low-flying plane can trespass if it enters this usable space.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

===Constructive trespass===
A constructive trespass occurs when a person who has permission to be on the land overstays their welcome. A person who stays in a business after its closing time, or who goes to a dinner party but refuses to leave long after the other guests have gone home, is a trespasser despite his initially proper presence. Furthermore, a guest's status as a trespasser arises as soon as he resists when the property owner tells him to leave the property. This is not a constructive trespass if the guest is unconscious.

==Duties owed to trespassers==
As a broad general rule, property owners owe few duties to trespassers to safeguard them from injuries that may occur on their property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Premises Liability Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/premises_liability/premises_liability.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With respect to the duties owed to trespassers, there are two types of trespassers to consider:
* The ''undiscovered'' trespasser, to whom the property owner owes only a duty not to "trap" or wilfully harm the trespasser.
* The ''anticipated'' or ''discovered'' trespasser. To those parties, the landowner owes a ''duty of common humanity'' (See ''[[British Railways Board v. Herrington]]'')—a [[duty to warn]] them of deadly conditions on the land which would be hidden to them, but of which the property owner is aware.

For injury claims by trespassers, the concept of traps was narrowly defined. More recently, courts in some jurisdictions have engaged in some creativity, adopting a broader interpretation of a trap.

A warning sign at the entrance to the land is generally sufficient to warn trespassers of possible hazards on a property or land. However, a property owner is under no duty to ascertain hazards on his property for the benefit of trespassers, and cannot be held liable for failing to discover a previously unknown hazard that injures a trespasser.

In some jurisdictions an adult trespasser who is injured while on a defendant's property cannot sue under a theory of [[strict liability]], even if the landowner was engaged in [[ultrahazardous activities]], such as the keeping of [[wildlife|wild animals]], or the use of [[explosives]]. Instead, the trespasser must prove that the property owner intentionally or wantonly injured the plaintiff to recover.

Some jurisdictions extend additional protections to children who trespass on the properly of others. For example, if there is a potentially hazardous object or condition on the land that might be attractive to young children, the trespass may be deemed "anticipated" under the doctrine of [[attractive nuisance]] such that the child may be able to succeed with an injury claim.

In some regions of the world, a property owner may use reasonable (typically meaning non-deadly) force to prevent a person from trespassing on their land, or to expel a trespasser.&lt;ref&gt;Toyota Finance Australia LTD v Dennis [2002] NSWCA 369 at 65 [http://www.lexisnexis.com/au/legal/results/enhdocview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;ersKey=23_T20331177512&amp;format=GNBFULL&amp;startDocNo=0&amp;resultsUrlKey=0_T20331177535&amp;backKey=20_T20331177536&amp;csi=267706&amp;docNo=3&amp;scrollToPosition=23]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a property owner may by restricted from expelling a trespasser if doing so would expose the trespasser to a risk of serious injury. For example, a trespasser who takes shelter in a stranger's barn during a powerful storm cannot be expelled until the storm is over.

==United States==
Many jurisdictions within the United States have passed statutes to modify or clarify the [[common law]] duties owed by a property owner to a trespasser (for example, by explicitly permitting the property owner to use deadly force to expel trespassers).{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The '''United States nationality law''' is a uniform rule of [[naturalization]] of the United States set out in the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]], enacted under the power of [[Article I of the US Constitution#Enumerated powers|Article I, section 8, clause 4]] of the [[United States Constitution]] (also referred to as the '''Nationality Clause'''), which reads: Congress shall have Power - "To establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization..." The 1952 Act sets forth the legal requirements for the acquisition of, and divestiture from, American [[nationality]]. The requirements have become more explicit since the ratification of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the Constitution, with the most recent changes to the law having been made by Congress in 2001.

U.S. taxes payable may be alternatively reduced by [[foreign tax credit|credits for foreign income taxes]] regardless of the length of stay abroad.

Male U.S. citizens (including those living permanently abroad and those with multiple citizenships) from 18–25 years of age are required to register with the [[Selective Service System]] at age 18 for possible [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] into the [[Military of the United States|armed forces]].  Although no one has been drafted in the U.S. since 1973, draft registration continues in the case of a possible reinstatement on some future date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sss.gov/FSwho.htm WHO MUST REGISTER]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507213840/http://www.sss.gov/FSwho.htm |date=May 7, 2009 }}, [http://www.sss.gov/ U.S. Selective Service System website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713031436/https://www.sss.gov/ |date=2015-07-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Oath of citizenship (United States)|Oath of Citizenship]], immigrants becoming naturalized U.S. citizens swear that when required by law they will bear arms on behalf of the United States, will perform noncombatant service in the U.S. Armed Forces, and will perform work of national importance under civilian direction.

==Acquisition of citizenship==
There are various ways a person can acquire United States citizenship, either at birth or later on in life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gansallo|first1=Ayodele|last2=Bernstein-Baker|first2=Judith|title=Understanding Immigration Law and Practice|date=2016|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Law &amp; Business|isbn=9781454850380|page=570|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u90uDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA570|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth within the United States===
{{Main article|Birthright citizenship in the United States|Jus soli}}
Section 1 of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] provides that "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CDOC-110hdoc50/pdf/CDOC-110hdoc50.pdf|title=THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA As Amended|date=July 25, 2007|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|version=110th Congress, First Session, House of Representatives, Document No. 110-50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Native American tribes within the geographical boundaries of the U.S. held a special sovereignty status, the tribes were not "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" and thus Native Americans who were born into tribes were not considered citizens, even if they left the tribe and settled in white society, which the Supreme Court upheld in ''[[Elk v. Wilkins]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Elk v.

Wong Kim Ark|journal=United States Reports|date=1898|volume=169|pages=649–732}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court ruled that a person becomes a citizen of the United States at the time of birth, by virtue of the first clause of the 14th Amendment, if at a minimum that person:
* Is born in the United States&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* Has parents that have permanent domicile and residence in the United States&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Through birth abroad to United States citizens===
{{See also|jus sanguinis}}

====Birth abroad to two United States citizens====
A child is automatically granted citizenship if:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
#Both parents were U.S. citizens at the time of the child's birth;
#The parents are married; and
#At least one parent lived in the United States prior to the child's birth. INA 301(c) and INA 301(a)(3) state, "and one of whom has had a residence."
The FAM (Foreign Affairs Manual) states "no amount of time specified."

A person's record of birth abroad, if registered with a U.S. consulate or embassy, is proof of citizenship. They may also apply for a passport or a Certificate of Citizenship as proof of citizenship.

====Birth abroad to one United States citizen====
A person born on or after November 14, 1986, is a U.S. citizen if all of the following are true:&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State"&gt;{{Cite journal

#One of the person's parents was a U.S. citizen when the person in question was born
#The citizen parent lived at least five years in the United States before the child's birth
#A minimum of two of these five years in the United States were after the citizen parent's 14th birthday.

INA 301(g) makes additional provisions to satisfy the physical-presence requirements for periods citizens spent abroad in "[[Military discharge#Honorable|honorable service]] in the Armed Forces of the United States, or periods of employment with the United States Government or with an international organization." Additionally citizens, who spent time living abroad as the "[[Dependent (law)|dependent]] unmarried son or daughter and a member of the household of a person" in any of the previously mentioned organizations can also be counted.

A person's record of birth abroad, if registered with a U.S. consulate or embassy, is proof of citizenship. Such a person may also apply for a passport or a Certificate of Citizenship to have a record of citizenship.  Such documentation is often useful to prove citizenship in lieu of the availability of an American birth certificate.

Different rules apply for persons born abroad to one U.S. citizen before November 14, 1986.  United States law on this subject changed multiple times throughout the twentieth century, and the law is applicable as it existed at the time of the individual's birth.

For persons born between December 24, 1952 and November 14, 1986, a person is a U.S. citizen if all of the following are true:&lt;ref name="U.S. Department of State"/&gt;

#The person's parents were married at the time of birth
#One of the person's parents was a U.S. citizen when the person was born
#The citizen parent lived at least ten years in the United States before the child's birth;
#A minimum of 5 of these 10 years in the United States were after the citizen parent's 14th birthday.

For persons born to two people who are not married to each other, the person is a U.S. citizen if all the following apply:

===Naturalization===
[[File:Usnaturalization.jpg|A judge swears in a new citizen. New York, 1910|thumb]]
A person who was not born a U.S. citizen may acquire U.S. citizenship through a process known as naturalization.

====Eligibility for naturalization====
{{see also|Ideological restrictions on naturalization in U.S. law}}
To become a naturalized United States citizen, one must be at least eighteen years of age at the time of filing, a legal [[Permanent residence (United States)|permanent resident]] (or non-citizen national) of the United States, and have had a status of a legal permanent resident in the United States for five years before they apply. (This 5-year requirement is reduced to three years if they (a) acquired legal permanent resident status, (b) have been married to and living with a citizen for the past three years and (c) the spouse has been a U.S. citizen for at least three years prior to the applicant applying for naturalization.) They must have been physically present for at least 30 months of 60 months prior to the date of filing their application. Also during those 60 months if the legal permanent resident was outside of the U.S. for a continuous period of 6 months or more they are disqualified from naturalizing (certain exceptions apply for those continuous periods of six months to 1 year).&lt;ref name=uscisNaturalization/&gt;

The territory of the United States, for the purposes of determining one's period of residence, includes the fifty states, District Columbia, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-101/0-0-0-195.html|title=Act 101(a)15P - USCIS|author=|date=|website=www.uscis.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423182342/https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/0-0-0-1/0-0-0-29/0-0-0-101/0-0-0-195.html|archivedate=23 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]] has been added to this list effective November 28, 2009.

Some exemptions from permanent residency exist for certain qualifying naturalization applicants. For example, an undocumented immigrant who served in the US military during a designated period of hostility may naturalize without having first been a permanent resident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/policymanual/HTML/PolicyManual-Volume12-PartI-Chapter3.html|title=Military Service during Hostilities (INA 329) - Chapter 3, Part I, Volume 12 - Policy Manual - USCIS|author=|date=|website=www.uscis.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221220641/https://www.uscis.gov/policymanual/HTML/PolicyManual-Volume12-PartI-Chapter3.html|archivedate=21 February 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An immigrant who successfully completes the [[Military accessions vital to national interest|MAVNI]] program may naturalize in 10 weeks without first having been a permanent resident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscis.gov/military|title=Military|author=|date=|website=uscis.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319141729/https://www.uscis.gov/military|archivedate=19 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, an immigrant who has made extraordinary contributions can be exempted from residency as well as the physical presence requirement and prohibitions for support of totalitarianism and or communism.&lt;ref&gt;INA §208(b)(2)(A)&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-citizen U.S. national (see [[#Nationals|below]]) is also eligible for naturalization after becoming a resident of any state. For such persons (unlike most other applicants for naturalization), time spent in [[American Samoa]] counts as time spent in the United States for the purposes of determining residence and physical presence.&lt;ref name="uscis-nationals-exception"&gt;{{cite web

====Citizenship test====
The entire citizenship test is in the form of a one-on-one interview. The citizenship test has four components: a speaking/comprehension test, a reading test, a writing test and a civics test.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uscitizenshipsupport.com/us-citizenship-test-tips/us-citizenship-test-what-about/|title=Article "U.S. Citizenship Test – What is it all about?"|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223140141/http://uscitizenshipsupport.com/us-citizenship-test-tips/us-citizenship-test-what-about/|archivedate=2016-12-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the civics test, applicants for citizenship are asked ten questions, and must answer at least six with the expected answers. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has published a list of 100 sample questions (with the answers that should be given when taking the test), from which the questions asked are always drawn. The full list of questions is in the document "A Guide to Naturalization", available for free from the USCIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Besides passing the citizenship test, citizenship applicants must also satisfy other specific requirements of naturalization to successfully obtain U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Eligibility for public office====
A person who becomes a U.S. citizen through naturalization is not considered a [[natural born citizen]]. Consequently, naturalized U.S. citizens are not eligible to become [[President of the United States]] or [[Vice President of the United States]], which would ordinarily be the case as established by the [[Presidential Succession Act]]. For example, though the [[U.S. Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]] and the [[U.S. Secretary of Labor|Secretary of Labor]] are tenth and eleventh in the presidential line of succession,  [[Elaine Chao]] and [[Carlos Gutierrez]] (respectively former U.S. Secretaries of Labor and Commerce under President [[George W. Bush]]) would have been unable to succeed to the presidency because they became U.S. citizens through naturalization. The highest-ranking naturalized citizens to have been excluded from the Presidential Line of Succession were [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Madeleine Albright]], each of whom would have been fourth in line as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] had they been natural born citizens.

Whether this restriction applies to children born to non-U.S. citizens but adopted as minors by U.S. citizens is a matter of some debate, since the [[#Child Citizenship Act of 2000|Child Citizenship Act of 2000]] is ambiguous as to whether acquisition of citizenship by that route is to be regarded as naturalized or natural-born. Those who argue that the restriction does not apply point out that the child automatically becomes a citizen even though violating every single requirement of [[#Eligibility for naturalization|eligibility for naturalization]], and thus the case falls closer to the situation of birth abroad to U.S. citizens than to naturalization.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Some argue that the phrase "natural born citizen" describes a category of citizenship distinct from that described by the phrase "U.S. Citizen" in [[Article Two of the United States Constitution]], and this was discussed during the constitutional convention of 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John R. Vile|title=The Constitutional Convention of 1787: a comprehensive encyclopedia of America's founding|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oyFpDS8p33sC|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-669-5|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oyFpDS8p33sC&amp;pg=PA605 605–606]|chapter=President, Qualifications}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is true that "natural born citizen" is not defined anywhere within the text of the Constitution and that the Constitution makes use of the phrase "citizen" and "natural born citizen", Supreme Court Decisions from [[United States v. Wong Kim Ark]] to the present have considered the distinction to be between natural-born and naturalized citizenship.

In her 1988 article in the Yale Law Journal, Jill Pryor wrote, "It is well settled that 'native-born' citizens, those born in the United States, qualify as natural born.  It is also clear that persons born abroad of alien parents, who later become citizens by naturalization, do not.  But whether a person born abroad of American parents, or of one American and one alien parent, qualifies as natural born has never been resolved."&lt;ref&gt;Jill Pryor, [http://yalelawjournal.org/images/pdfs/pryor_note.pdf The Natural-Born Citizen Clause and Presidential Eligibility: An Approach for Resolving Two Hundred Years of Uncertainty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603065432/http://yalelawjournal.org/images/pdfs/pryor_note.pdf |date=2011-06-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An April 2000 CRS [[Congressional Research Service Report|report]] by the [[Congressional Research Service]], asserts that most constitutional scholars interpret the phrase "natural born citizen" as including citizens born outside the United States to parents who are U.S. citizens under the "natural born" requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Chester Arthur]], born in the U.S. state of [[Vermont]] of an American mother and Irish father, was sworn in as president, but his status as a "natural-born citizen" was challenged on the grounds that he was allegedly born in Canada or Ireland.  Presidential candidates [[George W. Romney]] (born in Mexico), [[Ted Cruz]] (born in Canada), [[Barry Goldwater]] and [[John McCain]] (born in [[U.S. territories]]), were never seriously challenged on the basis of their "natural born" citizenship, but no candidate falling under this classification has been elected president.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} [[Charles Curtis]] falls under this classification by birth in Kansas Territory, was elected and served as vice president, proving constitutional eligibility for president. Similarly, Al Gore was born in Washington, D.C., and yet was elected and served as vice president, provides additional evidence of Constitutional eligibility even though he too was born outside a US state.

===Expeditious naturalization of children===
Effective April 1, 1995, a child born outside the U.S. to a U.S. citizen parent, if not already a citizen by birth because the parent does not meet the residency requirement (see above), may qualify for expeditious naturalization based on the physical presence of the child's grandparent in the U.S.  In general the grandparent should have spent five years in the U.S., at least two of which were after the age of 14.

The process of naturalization, including the [[Oath of citizenship (United States)|oath of allegiance]], must be completed before the child's 18th birthday.   It is not necessary for the child to be admitted to the U.S. as a lawful permanent resident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Child Citizenship Act of 2000===
Effective February 27, 2001, the [[Child Citizenship Act of 2000]] provided that a non-U.S. citizen child (aged under 18) with a U.S. citizen parent, and in the custody of that parent while resident in the United States, automatically acquired U.S. citizenship.
To be eligible, a child must meet the definition of "child" for naturalization purposes under immigration law, and must also meet the following requirements:
* The child has at least one United States citizen parent (by birth or naturalization)
* The child is under 18 years of age
* The child is currently residing permanently in the United States in the legal and physical custody of the United States citizen parent
* The child has been admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident or has been adjusted to this status
* An adopted child must also meet the requirements applicable to the particular provision under which they qualified for admission as an adopted child under immigration law

==Dual citizenship==
&lt;!-- this section is the target of an internal link from [[Nationality Law of the Republic of China]] --&gt;

Based on the U.S. Department of State regulation on [[dual citizenship]] (7 FAM 082), the Supreme Court of the United States has stated that dual citizenship is a "status long recognized in the law" and that "a person may have and exercise rights of nationality in two countries and be subject to the responsibilities of both. The mere fact he asserts the rights of one citizenship does not, without more, mean that he renounces the other", ''[[Kawakita v. U.S.]]'', 343 U.S. 717 (1952). In ''[[Schneider v. Rusk]]'', 377 U.S. 163 (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a naturalized U.S. citizen has the right to return to his native country and to resume his former citizenship, and also to remain a U.S. citizen even if he never returns to the United States.

The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) neither defines dual citizenship nor takes a position for it or against it. There has been no prohibition against dual citizenship, but some provisions of the INA and earlier U.S. [[nationality law]]s were designed to reduce situations in which dual citizenship exists. Although naturalizing citizens are required to undertake an [[Oath of citizenship (United States)|oath]] renouncing previous allegiances, the oath has never been enforced to require the actual termination of original citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newcitizen.us/dual.html |title=Dual Citizenship |accessdate=2009-03-18 |work= |publisher= |date= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201180006/http://newcitizen.us/dual.html |archivedate=2009-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the U.S. government does not endorse dual citizenship as a matter of policy, it recognizes the existence of dual citizenship and completely tolerates the maintenance of multiple citizenship by U.S. citizens. In the past, claims of other countries on dual-national U.S. citizens sometimes placed them in situations where their obligations to one country were in conflict with the laws of the other. However, as fewer countries require military service and most base other obligations (such as the payment of taxes) on residence and not citizenship, these conflicts have become less frequent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1753.html |title=US State Department Services Dual Nationality |publisher=U.S. Department of State |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014040015/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1753.html |archivedate=October 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A U.S. citizen may lose his or her dual citizenship by obtaining naturalization in a foreign state, by taking an oath or making an affirmation or other formal declaration of allegiance to a foreign state or political subdivision thereof, by serving in the armed forces of a foreign state, or by performing certain other acts, but only if the act was performed "voluntarily and with the intention to relinquish U.S. nationality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/Advice-about-Possible-Loss-of-US-Nationality-Dual-Nationality.html|title=Advice about Possible Loss of U.S. Nationality and Dual Nationality|author=|date=|website=travel.state.gov|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414071500/https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/Advice-about-Possible-Loss-of-US-Nationality-Dual-Nationality.html|archivedate=14 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One circumstance where dual citizenship may run counter to expectations of government agencies is in matters of [[security clearance]]. For example, any person granted a [[Yankee White]] vetting must be absolutely free of foreign influence, and for other security clearances one of the grounds that may result in a rejected application is an actual or potential conflict of national allegiances.

Visa requirements for the United States citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of United States. According to the 2017 [[Visa (document)#Visa Restrictions Index|Visa Restrictions Index]], holders of a United States passport can visit 174 countries and territories visa-free or with visa on arrival. The United States passport is currently ranked joint 3rd alongside in terms of travel freedom in the world.

In 2017, the United States nationality is ranked twenty-seventh in the [[The Quality of Nationality Index|Nationality Index]] (QNI). This index differs from the [[Visa (document)#Visa restrictions|Visa Restrictions Index]], which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition to travel freedom, on internal factors such as peace &amp; stability, economic strength, and human development as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.businessinsider.de/nationalities-with-the-best-quality-of-life-2016-6?r=UK&amp;IR=T |title= The 41 nationalities with the best quality of life |date= 2016-02-06 |website=  www.businessinsider.de |access-date= 2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-citizen U.S. nationals may reside and work in the United States without restrictions, and may apply for citizenship under similar rules as foreign nationals or citizens, except that they do not need to hold U.S. permanent resident status when they apply or to have held it for any length of time before applying.&lt;ref name="uscis-nationals-exception"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ecfr-nationals-exception"/&gt; Like permanent residents, they are [[Right of foreigners to vote in the United States|not currently allowed by any U.S. state to vote in federal or state elections]], although, as with permanent residents, there is no constitutional prohibition against their doing so.

For example, for Puerto Rico, all persons born in Puerto Rico between April 11, 1899, and January 12, 1941, were automatically conferred U.S. citizenship as of the date the law was signed by the President [[Harry S. Truman]] on June 27, 1952.  Additionally, all persons born in Puerto Rico on or after January 13, 1941, are citizens at birth of the United States.  Note that because of when the law was passed, for some, the citizenship status was retroactive.

The law contains one other section of historical note, concerning the [[Panama Canal Zone]] and the nation of Panama. In {{usc|8|1403}}, the law states that anyone born in the Canal Zone or in Panama itself, on or after February 26, 1904, to a mother or father who is a United States citizen, was "declared" to be a United States citizen at birth.

All persons born in the U.S. Virgin Islands on or after February 25, 1927, are native-born citizens of the United States.  The {{usc|8|1406}} also indicate that all the persons and their children born in the U.S. Virgin Islands subsequent to January 17, 1917, and prior to February 25, 1927, are declared to be citizens of the United States as of February 25, 1927 if complied with the U.S. law dispositions.

All persons born in Alaska on or after June 2, 1924, are native-born citizens of the United States.  Alaska was declared a [[U.S. state]] on January 3, 1959.

All persons born in Hawaii on or after April 30, 1900, are native-born citizens of the United States.  Hawaii was declared a U.S. state on August 21, 1959.

All persons born in the island of Guam on or after April 11, 1899 (whether before or after August 1, 1950) subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, are declared to be citizens of the United States.

Currently under the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]] (INA) effective from December 24, 1952 to present the definition of the "United States" for nationality purposes, was expanded to add [[Guam]]; and, effective November 3, 1986, the [[Northern Mariana Islands#Political status|Northern Mariana Islands]] (in addition to [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Virgin Islands of the United States]]).&lt;ref&gt;See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(36) and 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(38) Providing the term "State" and "United States" definitions on the U.S. Federal Code, Immigration and Nationality Act {{USC|8|1101a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons born in these territories on or after December 24, 1952 acquire U.S. citizenship at birth on the same terms as persons born in other parts of the United States; and "Outlying possessions of the United States" was restricted to [[American Samoa]] and [[Swains Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Loss of citizenship==
{{See also|List of former United States citizens who relinquished their nationality|List of denaturalized former citizens of the United States}}

As a historical matter, U.S. citizenship could be forfeited upon the undertaking of various acts, including naturalization in a foreign state (with a willful intent to renounce U.S. citizenship) or [[Nishikawa v. Dulles|service in foreign armed forces]]. In addition, before 1967 it was possible to lose the citizenship due to voting in foreign elections. However, the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional the provisions of Section 349(a) which provided for loss of nationality by voting in a foreign election in the case ''[[Afroyim v.

{{USC|8|1481}} specifically outlines how loss of nationality may occur, which predominantly involves willful acts over the age of 18 with the intention of relinquishing United States nationality.  U.S. Supreme Court decisions beginning with ''[[Afroyim v. Rusk]]'' constitutionally limited the government's capacity to terminate citizenship to those cases in which an individual engaged in conduct with an intention of abandoning their citizenship.

In 1990, the U.S. State Department adopted new regulations which presume that an individual does not intend to give up citizenship when performing one of the above potentially expatriating acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://attach3.bdwm.net/attach/boards/PKUdevelopment/M.1323515948.A/96%2d13402.pdf|author=Carmen A.

After a U.S. citizen satisfies the Department of State procedures, the Department of State issues a [[Certificate of Loss of Nationality]] (CLN) signifying that the Department of State has accepted the U.S. Embassy/Consulate's recommendation to allow the renunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renunciation of citizenship includes renunciation of all rights and privileges of citizenship. A person who wants to renounce U.S. citizenship cannot decide to retain some of the privileges of citizenship, as the State Department regards this as logically inconsistent with the concept of renunciation. Thus, such a person can be said to lack a full understanding of renouncing citizenship or lack the necessary intent to renounce citizenship, and the Department of State will not approve a loss of citizenship in such instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

People giving up U.S. citizenship may be subject to an [[expatriation tax]]. Originally, under the Foreign Investors Tax Act of 1966, people determined to be giving up citizenship for the purpose of avoiding [[Taxation in the United States|U.S. taxation]] were subject to 10 years of continued taxation on their U.S.-source income, to prevent ex-citizens from taking advantage of special tax incentives offered to foreigners investing in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.senate.gov/library/reports/committee/download/?id=4ee7ee42-2874-4976-8161-00919c85e474|title=Foreign Investors Tax Act of 1966; Presidential Election Fund Act; and other amendments|publisher=[[United States Senate Committee on Finance]]|date=1966-10-11|accessdate=2014-06-04|page=28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413184200/http://www.finance.senate.gov/library/reports/committee/download/?id=4ee7ee42-2874-4976-8161-00919c85e474|archivedate=2013-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2008, these provisions no longer apply; instead, ex-citizens who meet certain asset or tax liability thresholds pay a one-time capital gains tax on a deemed sale of their U.S. and non-U.S. assets, regardless of their reasons for giving up citizenship.&lt;ref name="Pfiefer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/article.asp?articleid=86260|first=Michael G.|last=Pfeifer|title=United States: The Final State of Expatriation?

The moot involves a written round after which teams are selected for the oral round. Teams argue a hypothetical case on issues of [[international human rights law]] in either English or French as if it will be adjudicated by a hypothetical International Human Rights Court, on the basis of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and other applicable (such as regional) human rights instruments.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.up.ac.za/sitefiles/file/47/About_eng_nnn.doc WORLD HUMAN RIGHTS MOOT COURT COMPETITION.

'''''ZeniMax v. Oculus''''' is a civil lawsuit filed by [[ZeniMax Media]] against [[Oculus VR]] on charges of theft of [[intellectual property]] relating to Oculus' [[virtual reality]] device, the [[Oculus Rift]].

==Background==
The [[Oculus Rift]] is a [[virtual reality]] headset that was developed by [[Oculus VR]]. The company was founded by [[Palmer Luckey]], who had a keen interest in [[head-mounted display]]s and had developed a prototype of the Oculus Rift by 2012. Concurrently, [[John Carmack]], at the time of [[id Software]], a subsidiary under [[ZeniMax Media]], also was interested in head-mounted displays, saw Luckey's prototype for the Rift and modified it, showcasing the updated prototype at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012]] (E3) that June using a modified version of id's ''[[Doom 3]]''.

Following E3 2012, Oculus VR launched a [[Kickstarter]] to fund further development of the Rift, ultimately raising more than $2.4 million through it, one of the largest crowdfunding ventures at that time. The attention led to additional [[venture funding]], with more than $91 million invested by 2013. During this, Carmack left id Software to become the Chief Technology Officer for Oculus VR. In March 2014, [[Mark Zuckerberg]] announced that [[Facebook]] had acquired Oculus VR for $2 billion.

[[File:Oculus_Rift_-_Developer_Version_-_Back_and_Control_Box.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Oculus Rift]] "Development Kit 1" headset, developed from the 2013 Kickstarter funding]]
Around May 2014, shortly after Facebook made its deal to acquire Oculus VR, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that ZeniMax had sent two letters to Facebook and Oculus VR, asserting that any technology contributions Carmack had made towards VR while he was still an employee of id Software, including the "VR testbed" that Carmack had frequently demonstrated, were within the [[intellectual property]] (IP) of id and ZeniMax.&lt;ref name="wsj letters"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303948104579534013624548846 |title=Oculus, Facebook Face Challenge to Rights Over 'Rift'|first1=Liz|last1=Hoffman|first2=Reed|last2=Albergotti|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=May 1, 2014|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement, ZeniMax said that they "provided necessary VR technology and other valuable assistance to Palmer Luckey and other Oculus employees in 2012 and 2013 to make the Oculus Rift a viable VR product, superior to other VR market offerings."&lt;ref name="verge-zeniconflict"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/1/5671620/oculus-and-facebook-face-legal-challenge|title=Oculus and Facebook face legal challenge from John Carmack's former employer|first=Sean|last=Hollister|date=May 1, 2014|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZeniMax stated that a 2012 [[non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA) and a non-ownership agreement that covered VR technology and signed by Luckey, prior to Oculus VR's formation, would cover any of Carmack's contributions to VR.&lt;ref name=verge-onedocument&gt;{{cite web|title=One document could decide whether Oculus owes ZeniMax millions|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/1/5672928/this-document-could-decide-whether-oculus-owes-zenimax-millions|first=Sean|last=Hollister|work=[[The Verge]]|date=May 1, 2014|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZeniMax contends that they had attempted to resolve these issues with Oculus prior to their acquisition by Facebook "whereby ZeniMax would be compensated for its intellectual property through equity ownership in Oculus but were unable to reach a satisfactory resolution".&lt;ref name="verge-zeniconflict"/&gt; Oculus denied the claims, stating that "It's unfortunate, but when there's this type of transaction, people come out of the woodwork with ridiculous and absurd claims".&lt;ref name="wsj letters"/&gt;

ZeniMax formally filed a lawsuit against Luckey and Oculus VR on May 21, 2014 in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas]] and seeking a jury trial. The lawsuit contended that Luckey and Oculus used ZeniMax's "trade secrets, copyrighted computer code, and technical know-how relating to virtual reality technology", as provided by Carmack, to develop the Oculus Rift product, and sought for financial damages for contract breach, copyright infringement, and unfair competition. ZeniMax also charged that Oculus, through Carmack, were able to hire several former ZeniMax/id Software employees who also had technical knowledge of its VR technology, which would allow them to rapidly fine-tune the VR testbed system to create the Rift.&lt;ref name="engadget suit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/05/21/oculus-vr-lawsuit|title=Oculus VR and Palmer Luckey being sued by CTO's former employer|first=Ben|last=Gilbert|date=May 21, 2014|accessdate=February 1, 2017|work=[[Engadget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/21/5739086/oculus-vr-and-its-founder-sued-by-zenimax-and-id-software|title=Oculus VR and its founder sued by ZeniMax and id Software|first=Josh|last=Lowensohn|date=May 21, 2014|accessdate=February 1, 2017|work=[[The Verge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its files, ZeniMax revealed it has "invested tens of millions of dollars in research and development" into VR technology, and that because they felt "Oculus and Luckey lacked the necessary expertise and technical know-how to create a viable virtual reality headset", they "sought expertise and know-how from Zenimax".&lt;ref name="engadget suit"/&gt;

Oculus initially responded to the charges as "The lawsuit filed by ZeniMax has no merit whatsoever. As we have previously said, ZeniMax did not contribute to any Oculus technology. Oculus will defend these claims vigorously."&lt;ref name="engadget suit"/&gt; The company filed its formal response on June 25, 2014, stating that ZeniMax "falsely claims ownership in Oculus VR technology in a transparent attempt to take advantage of the Oculus VR sale to Facebook".&lt;ref name="polygon reply"/&gt; Oculus stated that prior to the acquisition by Facebook, "ZeniMax never raised any claim of infringement against Oculus VR, undoubtedly because ZeniMax never has contributed any intellectual property or technology to Oculus VR".&lt;ref name="polygon reply"/&gt;

The response stated that ZeniMax's filing "deliberately misstating some facts and omitting others" and that "there is not a line of ZeniMax code or any of its technology in any Oculus VR product".&lt;ref name="polygon reply"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sarkar|first1=Samit|title=Oculus: ZeniMax suit is a 'transparent attempt to take advantage' of Facebook acquisition|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/25/5841764/oculus-zenimax-lawsuit-response}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oculus' response included photographs and documents that demonstrated they had been working on their own VR technology as early as August 2010. The response further contended that the key document of ZeniMax's suit, the NDA signed by Luckey, was "never finalized", and thus is not a "valid and enforceable agreement".&lt;ref name="polygon reply"/&gt;

ZeniMax amended the case to include Facebook among the defendants on August 29, 2014. ZeniMax charged that Facebook intended to "leverage and commercially exploit Oculus’s virtual reality technology — which is built upon ZeniMax’s unlawfully misappropriated intellectual property — for the financial benefit of Facebook’s core business of online social networking and advertising."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/blog/techflash/2014/08/zenimax-adds-facebook-to-its-suit-against-oculus.html|title=Zenimax adds Facebook to its suit against Oculus, expands allegations against social network|first=Bill|last=Flook|date=August 29, 2014|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[Washington Business Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oculus and Facebook attempted to have the case dismissed, but the presiding judge disagreed, and, in August 2015, allowed the case to proceed to a jury trial expected to start in August 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/10/game-publishers-lawsuit-against-oculus-moves-forward/?_r=0|title=Game Publisher's Lawsuit Against Oculus Moves Forward|first=Nick|last=Winfield|date=August 10, 2015|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==District Court trial==
During the [[discovery (law)|discovery phase]], ZeniMax had sought a [[deposition (law)|deposition]] from Zuckerberg, believing he had "unique knowledge" of the Facebook-Oculus deal. At request from Facebook, the judge ruled that Zuckerberg must provide a deposition, but only after lesser-ranking employees had been deposed as to have a "less intrusive discovery" process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3013144/legal/facebooks-zuckerberg-ordered-to-testify-over-oculus-purchase.html|title=Facebook's Zuckerberg ordered to testify over Oculus purchase|first=John|last=Ribeiro|date=December 9, 2015|accessdate=February 1, 2017|work=[[PC World]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, it was discovered that ZeniMax had further modified their complaint, specifically adding by name Carmack as Oculus's CTO, and [[Brendan Iribe]] as Oculus' CEO. The updated complaint alleged that during his last days at id Software, Carmack "copied thousands of documents from a computer at ZeniMax to a USB storage device", and later after his employment was terminated he "returned to ZeniMax's premises to take a customized tool for developing VR Technology belonging to ZeniMax that itself is part of ZeniMax's VR technology".&lt;ref name="gamespot amended 2016"/&gt; ZeniMax's complaint charged that Iribe had directed Oculus to "[disseminate] to the press the false and fanciful story that Luckey was the brilliant inventor of VR technology who had developed that technology in his parents' garage", when "Luckey lacked the training, expertise, resources, or know-how to create commercially viable VR technology", thus aiding in the IP theft from ZeniMax.&lt;ref name="gamespot amended 2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/zenimax-bashes-palmer-luckey-claims-oculus-lied-ab/1100-6442895|title=ZeniMax Bashes Palmer Luckey, Claims Oculus Lied About His Accomplishments|first=Alex|last=Newhouse|date=August 22, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2017|work= [[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, the updated complaint asserts Facebook had more involvement as it knew or had reason to know that Oculus' claims on the VR IP was false. Oculus responded, "This complaint filed by ZeniMax is one-sided and conveys only ZeniMax's interpretation of the story.&lt;ref name="gamespot amended 2016"/&gt; The court had a computer forensic expert evaluate the contents of Carmack's computer, and on October 28, 2016, the expert reported that from their findings "statements and representations that have been sworn to and are before the court are factually inaccurate".&lt;ref name="polygon oct2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/10/28/13462260/oculus-zenimax-lawsuit-expert|title=Carmack hard drive contains proof of factual inaccuracies in Oculus lawsuit, expert says|first=Brian|last=Crecente|date=October 28, 2016|accessdate=February 1, 2017|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ordered Oculus to comply with providing previously-redacted communications it had with Carmack as a result, as well as requesting [[Samsung]] to provide information on its [[Samsung Gear VR]] which was co-created with Oculus.&lt;ref name="polygon oct2016"/&gt;

The jury trial started on January 9, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-09/facebook-s-virtual-reality-foray-challenged-as-fanciful-story|title=Facebook's VR Foray Derided as 'Fanciful Story'|first=Tom|last=Korosec|date=January 9, 2017|accessdate=February 1, 2017|work=[[Bloomberg News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, Zuckerberg testified in court that he believed the allegations from ZeniMax Media were false.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/technology/mark-zuckerberg-oculus-trial-virtual-reality-facebook.html|title=Mark Zuckerberg, in Suit, Testifies in Oculus Intellectual Property Trial|last=Wingfield|first=Nick|date=2017-01-17|last2=Isaac|first2=Mike|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the plaintiff's closing arguments, ZeniMax's lawyers believed that they should receive $2 billion in compensation for Oculus' actions, and an additional $4 billion in punitive damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2017/1/26/14403302/oculus-vr-case-jury|title=Oculus VR case goes to jury with a $6B request|first1=Timothy|last1=Poon|first2=Brain|last2=Crecente|date=January 26, 2017|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision===
The jury trial completed on February 2, 2017, with the jury finding that Luckey had violated the NDA he had with ZeniMax, and awarding $500 million to ZeniMax.&lt;ref name='jury_result'&gt;{{cite news|last1=Orland|first1=Kyle|title=Oculus, execs liable for $500 million in ZeniMax VR trial|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/02/oculus-execs-liable-for-500-million-in-zenimax-vr-trial/|accessdate=1 February 2017|publisher=Ars Technica|date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='jury_form'&gt;https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/occverdict-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, the jury found that Oculus, Facebook, Luckey, Iribe, and Carmack did not misappropriate or steal trade secrets,&lt;ref name='jury_result'/&gt;&lt;ref name='jury_form'/&gt;&lt;ref name="polygon 500m"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/1/14474198/oculus-lawsuit-verdict|title=Oculus lawsuit ends with half billion dollar judgment awarded to ZeniMax|first1=Timothy|last1=Poon|first2=Brain|last2=Crecente|date=February 1, 2017|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; though ZeniMax continued to publicly assert otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2017/02/02/zenimax-may-seek-an-injunction-to-halt-oculus-rift-sales-in-wake-of-broken-nda-verdict-details-evidence-of-oculuss-alleged-theft|title=ZeniMax may seek an injunction to halt Oculus Rift sales in wake of broken NDA verdict, details evidence of Oculus's alleged theft|first=Brenna|last=Hillier|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[VG247]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oculus will have to pay $200 million for breaking the non-disclosure agreement, and additional $50 million for copyright infringement; for [[false designation of origin]] charges, Oculus and Luckey will have to pay $50 million each, while Iribe will be responsible for $150 million.&lt;ref name="polygon 500m" /&gt;

==Appeals and additional actions==
While Oculus said "the jury found decisively in our favor" over the issue of trade secrets,&lt;ref name="polygon 500m"/&gt; the company plans to file an appeal on the other charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/01/technology/zenimax-oculus-lawsuit-500-million|title=Facebook loses $500 million Oculus lawsuit|first=Selena|last=Larson|date=February 1, 2017|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carmack stated that he disagreed with the decision, particularly on ZeniMax's "characterization, misdirection, and selective omissions" regarding his behavior, adding that he had accounted for all the data in his possession.&lt;ref name="carmack response"/&gt; Carmack took issue with one of ZeniMax's expert witnesses who testified that non-literal copying, the act of creating a program with similar functions but using different computer code, constitutes a copyright violation.&lt;ref name="carmack response"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/290678/Zenimax_vs_Oculus_Carmack_denies_allegations_slams_expert_analysis.php|title=Zenimax vs. Oculus: Carmack denies allegations, slams expert analysis|first=Chris|last=Kerr|date=February 1, 2017|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[Gamasutra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ZeniMax stated that it is considering a court-ordered halt to all Oculus Rift units in light of the jury decision;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/1/14478258/zenimax-oculus-injunction|title=ZeniMax may seek court order to halt sale of current Oculus Rift headsets|first=Brian|last=Crecente|accessdate=February 2, 2017|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on February 24, 2017, filed an injunction to have the court halt sales of the Oculus Rift and development kits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/zenimax-files-injunction-against-oculus-over-use-o/1100-6448175|title=ZeniMax Files Injunction Against Oculus Over Use Of 'Stolen Tech'|first=Oscar|last=Dayus|date=February 24, 2017|accessdate=March 10, 2017|work=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral arguments for these injunctions were held on June 19, 2017. ZeniMax argued that either Oculus should halt sales of the Rift, or otherwise receive 20% of all Rift sales over the next ten years. Oculus, in addition to its own filings towards a new trial, requested the judge throw out the jury verdict, or reduced the penalty to $50 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/300362/After_winning_500M_in_lawsuit_against_Oculus_ZeniMax_pushes_for_more.php | title = After winning $500M in lawsuit against Oculus, ZeniMax pushes for more | first = Alex | last = Wawro | date = June 21, 2017 | accessdate = June 22, 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018, the judge overseeing the case agreed to cut the damages owed by Oculus in half to {{USD|250 million}} (with an additional {{USD|54 million}} in interest), while denying Zenimax their request to halt Oculus sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-27/facebook-oculus-virtual-reality-stolen-tech-damages-are-halved | title = Facebook Payout in Oculus Copyright Spat Cut to $250 Million | first=  Tom  |last = Korosec | date = June 27, 2018 | accessdate = June 28, 2018 | work = [[Bloomberg L.P.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other lawsuits==
In a separate lawsuit filed in March 2017, Carmack asserted that ZeniMax did not complete its payment to him of the acquisition of id Software, and asked the court to find for him for the remaining $22 million he states the company owes him. ZeniMax's lawyers asserted that from the Oculus case, they had not been found in violation of Carmack's employment after ZeniMax acquired id Software and that this new suit was "without merit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/business/technology/2017/03/09/legal-feud-over-facebook-owned-oculus-has-another-dallas-chapter|title=Legal feud over Facebook-owned Oculus has another Dallas chapter|first=Melissa|last=Repco|date=March 9, 2017|accessdate=March 10, 2017|work=[[Dallas News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October 2018, Carmack stated that he and ZeniMax reached an agreement and that "Zenimax has fully satisfied their obligations to me", and this lawsuit was subsequently dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/12/john-carmack-zenimax-lawsuits/ | title = 'Doom' co-creator John Carmack ends legal fight with ZeniMax | first = Daniel | last = Cooper | date = October 12, 2018 | accessdate = October 12, 2018 | work = [[Engadget]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, ZeniMax filed a new lawsuit towards Samsung over the Gear VR. In addition to the previous legal decision over IP issues related to the Oculus technology used in the Gear VR, ZeniMax also contends in the new suit that Carmack had allowed Matt Hooper, who had been recently fired as a creative director from id, into id's facilities after hours without permission to work out an "attack plan" for developing mobile VR, which would ultimately lead to the Gear VR device. ZeniMax seeks punitive damages as well as a share of profits from Gear VR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/15/15643252/zenimax-samsung-lawsuit | title = ZeniMax: Samsung’s Gear VR tech conceived at id | first = Brian | last=  Crecente | date = May 15, 2017 | accessdate =  May 16, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
