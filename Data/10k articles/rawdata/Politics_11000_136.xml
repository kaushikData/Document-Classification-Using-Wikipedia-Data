The '''51st government of Turkey''' (5 October 1995 – 30 October 1995) was a minority government led by [[Tansu Çiller]].

==Background==
Both the [[49th government of Turkey|49th]] and [[50th government of Turkey|50th governments]] were [[True Path Party]] and [[Social Democratic Populist Party (Turkey)|Social Democratic Populist Party (SHP)]] coalition governments, but after SHP merged with [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party(CHP)]] and [[Deniz Baykal]] was elected as the new leader of CHP, CHP stipulated an earlier date for the scheduled elections, and the coalition came to end.

Expelled Poles await transport at a railway crossing (in this photo, some members of the 129 families deported from the village of [[Sól, Silesian Voivodeship|Dolna Sól]]).{{sfn|Machcewicz|2010}}]]
'''Action Saybusch''' ({{lang-de|Aktion Saybusch}}, {{lang-pl|Akcja Żywiec}}) was the mass expulsion of some 18,000–20,000 ethnic [[Poles]] from the territory of [[Żywiec County]] in Polish [[Silesia]], conducted by the [[Wehrmacht]] and [[Ordnungspolizei#Police Battalions|German police]] during the German [[occupation of Poland]] in World War II. The main purpose of the [[Ethnic cleansing|forcible displacement]] of [[Poles|Polish nationals]] was to create space for ethnically German colonists from across Eastern Europe, after the annexation of western [[Poland]] into the [[Third Reich]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="fronda.pl"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fronda.pl/news/czytaj/tytul/saybusch_aktion_-_jak_hitler_budowal_raj_dla_swoich_chlopow_15558 | title=Saybusch Aktion - jak Hitler budował raj dla swoich chłopów | publisher=Redakcja  ''Fronda.pl'' | work=OBEP [[Institute of National Remembrance]], Katowice | date=20 September 2011 | accessdate=May 5, 2012 | author=Mirosław Sikora | language=Polish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Action was part of the Adolf Hitler's plan known as [[Lebensraum]] which involved Germanization of all [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|Polish areas]] west of the territory allocated to the [[General Government]]. The name of the Action came from the [[German language|German]] name of the city of [[Żywiec]] &amp;ndash; Saybusch.&lt;ref name="fronda.pl" /&gt; Displacements of the Poles from [[Żywiec]] and surrounding villages and towns was led by the occupation authorities under ''{{nobreak|SS-Obersturmbannführer}}'' [[Fritz Arlt]], who replaced [[Bruno Müller (Nazi)|Bruno Müller]] from RKF.&lt;ref name="Toppe"&gt;{{cite book | title=Militär und Kriegsvölkerrecht: Rechtsnorm, Fachdiskurs und Kriegspraxis in Deutschland 1899-1940 | publisher=Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag | author=Andreas Toppe | year=2008 | pages=398&amp;ndash; | isbn=978-3-486-58206-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sikora" /&gt;

''Aktion Saybusch'' lasted from September to December 1940, with some 3,200 [[Volksdeutsche]] brought in ''[[Heim ins Reich]]'' (Home into the Empire) from Romanian [[Bukovina]]. The process of expulsions continued thereafter. In total, between 1940 and 1944, around 50,000 Poles were forcibly removed from the region and replaced with about 4,000 settlers from Eastern Galicia and Volhynia who were given new [[Latifundium|latifundia]]. Before the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]], their transfer was agreed upon by both invaders at the [[Gestapo–NKVD Conferences]]. The expulsions from eastern [[Silesia]] were the direct responsibility of the ''{{nobreak|[[SS]]-[[Obergruppenführer]]}}'' [[Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski]], who was also responsible for instigating them.{{sfn|Machcewicz|2010}}&lt;ref name="Sikora" /&gt;

==Course of the expulsions==
[[File:Aktion Saybusch (Akcja Zywiec) 1940.jpg|thumb|right|Women awaiting transport during Action Saybusch, 24 September 1940]]
{{main|Heim ins Reich}}
In December 1939, the German police conducted a population census in the region. Over 99 percent of the locals declared Polish nationality. Analysis of the census figures set the stage for the mass deportations across [[Upper Silesia]], which was decided in July 1940. Some believe that Polish Jews were not a part of this ''Aktion''.{{sfn|Machcewicz|2010|loc=''Wśród wysiedlonych nie mogło być osób narodowości żydowskiej.'' There could have been no people of Jewish nationality among the deportees.}} On the other hand, the Holocaust historian [[Christopher R. Browning]] wrote that Jews had to have been an integral part of it. The local Germans "had not diligently carried out the identification and seizure of Polish activists and intelligentsia and thus were not eager to report the actual number of Jews deported."{{sfn|Browning|2007}} For example, the Jewish families from the [[:pl:Zabłocie (Żywiec)|Zabłocie district]] of Żywiec were transported to a [[Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland|transit ghetto and labour camp]] in [[Sucha Beskidzka]] in the spring of 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Jewish history of Zabłocie district of Żywiec |author=Andrzej Tepper |publisher=Kirkuty - cmentarze żydowskie w Polsce - Jewish cemeteries in Poland |url=http://www.kirkuty.xip.pl/zywiec.htm |language=pl |year=2015 |quote=''Liczba Żydów zamieszkujących Zabłocie, Isep i Sporysz - obecnie dzielnice Żywca - w 1938 roku doszła do dziewięciuset.'' The number of Jews living in Zabłocie, Isep and Sporysz neighborhoods of Żywiec reached 900 by 1938.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1942 sent aboard [[Holocaust trains]] to [[Auschwitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Jewish history of Sucha Beskidzka |author=[[Virtual Shtetl]] |publisher=[[POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews]] |url=http://www.sztetl.org.pl:80/en/article/sucha-beskidzka/5,history/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106044005/http://www.sztetl.org.pl:80/en/article/sucha-beskidzka/5,history/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-11-06 |chapter=Deportations to Auschwitz-Birkenau |chapter-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106044015/http://www.sztetl.org.pl:80/en/article/sucha-beskidzka/5,history/?action=view&amp;page=5 |via=Internet Archive |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everything was carefully prepared by the German occupation authorities, with schedules for the Polish train transports, food rations, and a group of Gestapo functionaries who spoke Polish. The cost of the operation estimated at about 300,000 [[German Reichsmark|Marks]] was to be paid by the captives themselves. The Action began simultaneously at different locations on September 22, 1940 at 5 in the morning. The police and army units surrounded Polish settlements and entered individual homes ordering farmers to get out within 20 minutes. Eye-witness Helena Szatanikowa remarked that all instructions came from a warrant printed in Polish.{{sfn|Machcewicz|2010}} Residents were requested to turn in all money and valuables. They were allowed to take with them only clothing and food, leaving behind everything else including livestock. They were marched and trucked to the so-called transit points in nearby towns of Żywiec, [[Rajcza]], [[Sucha Beskidzka]], [[Końskie]] and others. Meanwhile, the new Germanic settlers were already waiting at the distribution centers set up in [[Bogumin]] and [[Cieszyn]]. The Poles were subjected to selection, and separated into those "racially valuable" (for preferential treatment) and the rest, including women and children. Groups of young men were gathered for slave labor in Germany. According to German law all captives were to be supplied with necessities for 14 days; however, in practice they were stripped of the remnants of their own belongings in the process of luggage and body searches.{{sfn|Machcewicz|2010}}&lt;ref name="nsik.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nsik.com.pl/archiwum/95/a17.html | title=Pokrzywdzeni... | publisher=''Nad Sołą i Koszarawą'' No. 16 (95), year 5 | work=Trybuna, C/D/N | date=15 August 2002 | accessdate=May 5, 2012 | author=Malwina Palińska | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073923/http://www.nsik.com.pl/archiwum/95/a17.html | archive-date=2016-03-04 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assembly points at railway stations held each time about 1,000 Polish people; who were split into groups of 40 in line with already numbered rail cars. Each transport was usually sent separately, first to a railway junction in [[Łódź]] (for further selection), and from there, to previously chosen locations across the [[General Government]] (''Generalgouvernement''). Poles were delivered to towns and villages in the vicinity of [[Biłgoraj]], [[Wadowice]], [[Radzymin]], [[Łuków]], and to the [[Lublin]] and [[Kielce]] [[governorate]]s (see, the [[Lublin Reservation]] organized since October 1939), where they were dropped off alone without any help. Moreover, the Germans had warned the local population that the arriving deportees were criminals, thus further worsening their plight. They were met with fear and only reluctant acceptance at their destinations. Many died during transport. Others were forced to beg. The whole displacement action was conducted by the ''Polizei-Battalion No. 82'' (under Kegel) and ''Battalion No. 83'' (under [[Eugen Seim]], stationed in [[Jeleśnia]]) with approximately 500 soldiers as well as numerous SS, RKF and NSDAP functionaries including ''Katowice'' Gestapo officers.{{sfn|Machcewicz|2010}}&lt;ref name="Sikora"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.radiomaryja.pl/artykuly.php?id=100635 | title="Aktion Saybusch" na Żywiecczyźnie | publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance]], [[Katowice]] | work=Reprinted by Nasz Dziennik | date=16 September 2009 | accessdate=May 5, 2012 | author=Mirosław Sikora}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The settlers==
Abandoned Polish houses were cleaned and washed by forced laborers, mostly Jewish captives and some remaining Poles, who were later employed by the new farm-owners. Sheds deemed unsanitary were torn down. The department prepared swastika flags and portraits of Hitler to be placed at farms declared ready for occupation by the new Germans. Despite the Nazi propaganda campaign painting a rosy picture of their opulent future, the new hosts were not given the best of lands, which were reserved for the ''[[Reichsdeutsche]]'' who had served in the Wehrmacht. Many settlers were disappointed with the simple wooden cottages they were told to move into, and poor quality farmland.&lt;ref name="fronda.pl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nsik.com" /&gt; The ''[[Wartheland]]'' [[Nazi Party#Nazi Party Gaue|''Gaue'' officials]] on their part, lamented the newcomers' cultural backwardness in comparison with most Poles, and their inability to speak proper German. The new settlers were put under permanent police surveillance.&lt;ref name="projectinposterum"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.projectinposterum.org/docs/lucas2.htm |title=Chapter IV.

Preserving the Past for the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Expulsion of Poles from Żywiec County 02.jpg|thumb|Expulsion of the Polish women with children from the Żywiec County]]

''Aktion Saybusch'' officially ended on December 12, 1940, although the last transport (out of the total number of 19) was dispatched as late as January 31, 1941. On top of the 18,000&amp;ndash;20,000 deportees sent across [[General Government|the border]], some 8,000 Poles employed in local industries were moved away from their homes. It was a pilot project meant to be followed by similar actions, but in March 1941 ''SS-Obergruppenführer'' [[Hans Frank]], Governor of General Government, objected to further overcrowding of his district.{{sfn|Machcewicz|2010}} As a result, from 1942 on, Polish deportees were placed with other farmers in the poorest villages within the same territory of Silesia (''Interne Umsiedlung''), or sent to one of the new 23 camps called ''[[Polenlager]]'', created especially for that purpose. By the end of war, about 50,000 Polish nationals were displaced from Żywiec and the surrounding area, nearly one-third of its population. In ''Polenlagers'', further selections were carried out, including racial abductions of children from their parents, who after verification were sent to ''[[Lebensborn]]'' centers for Germanization. The displaced Polish farmers who returned to their homes in 1945 often found buildings razed or destroyed and everything else stolen by the settlers escaping the Soviet advance.{{sfn|Machcewicz|2010}}&lt;ref name="Sikora" /&gt;

==IPN investigation==
In the early 1990s, Action Saybusch was investigated by the Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes Against the Polish Nation at the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] in [[Katowice]] followed by a formal inquiry initiated in 1998 by Senator Władysław Bułka.&lt;ref name="nsik.com" /&gt; After a series of announcements in the press, some 1,000 persons contacted IPN with personally collected data and supplementary materials, revealing the identities of many displaced families. According to Ewa Koj from IPN most living victims had already been interviewed. The investigation was limited by their advancing age and had to be discontinued on legal grounds.&lt;ref name="nsik.com" /&gt; However, it was followed by a broad exhibit of documents and photographs collected in the process, and presented in many regional cities and towns including Katowice, Żywiec, [[Bielsko-Biała]] and others. The Nazi perpetrators of ethnic cleansing had already been sentenced during the [[Nuremberg trials]]. The IPN announced that discussing matters of war compensation was not within their mandate, which some living victims found disappointing.&lt;ref name="ipn.gov.pl-2"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/portal/pl/2/16349/Konferencja_naukowa_i_wystawa_Aktion_Saybusch_Wysiedlenia_mieszkancow_Zywiecczyz.html |title=Aktion Saybusch.

'''Black theology''', or '''Black liberation theology''', refers to a theological perspective which originated among African American seminarians and scholars, and in some [[black church]]es in the [[United States]] and later in other parts of the world. It  contextualizes [[Christianity]] in an attempt to help those of African descent overcome oppression. It especially focuses on the [[injustice]]s committed against [[African American]]s and black [[South African]]s during [[Jim Crow laws|American segregation]] and [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]], respectively.

Black theology seeks to liberate non-white people from multiple forms of political, social, economic, and religious subjugation and views [[Christian theology]] as a theology of liberation—"a rational study of the being of God in the world in light of the existential situation of an oppressed community, relating the forces of liberation to the essence of the Gospel, which is [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]," writes [[James H. Cone]], one of the original advocates of the perspective. Black theology mixes [[Christianity]] with questions of [[civil rights]], particularly raised by the [[Black Power movement]] and the [[Black Consciousness Movement]]. Further, Black theology has led the way and contributed to the discussion, and conclusion, that all theology is contextual - even what is known as [[systematic theology]].

== Development ==
Modern American origins of contemporary Black theology can be traced to July 31, 1966, when an ad hoc group of 51 concerned clergy, calling themselves the National Committee of Negro Churchmen (NCNC), bought a full page ad in ''[[The New York Times]]'' to publish their "Black Power Statement," which proposed a more aggressive approach to combating racism using the [[Bible]] for inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88552254&amp;ft=1&amp;f=1001|title=A Closer Look at Black Liberation Theology|last=Hagerty|first=Barbara Bradley|date=March 18, 2008|publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American history, ideas of [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race]] and [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] were supported by many Christians from particular readings of the Bible.&lt;ref name="Matthews"&gt;{{cite web|first=Terry|last=Matthews|url=http://www.wfu.edu/~matthetl/perspectives/twentyseven.html|title=A Black Theology of Liberation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430193355/http://www.wfu.edu/~matthetl/perspectives/twentyseven.html |archive-date=April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] supported slavery and slaveholders; it was not until June 20, 1995 that the formal [[Southern Baptist Convention#Recent history|Declaration of Repentance]] was adopted. This non-binding resolution declared that racism, in all its forms, is deplorable" and "lamented on a national scale and is also repudiated in history as an act of evil from which a continued bitter harvest unfortunately is reaped." The convention offered an apology for "condoning and/or perpetuating individual and systemic racism in our lifetime" and repentance for "racism of which many have been guilty, whether consciously or unconsciously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=SBC renounces racist past|journal=Christian Century|date=July 5, 1995|volume=112|issue=21|pages=671–672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christianity is associated with racism. Yet Christ; the forerunner of christian behavior professed individuality and in living testimony is demonized for the pursuit of individually targeted sanctuary. Therefore, there must then be a dialogue regarding the implications of racism in today's society and to what extent historical, intellectual, social factors affect the plight of the Black community. Cone relates that, once upon a time it was acceptable to lynch a Black man by hanging him from the tree; but today's economics destroy him by crowding many into a ghetto and letting filth and despair (created by themselves) put final touch on a coveted death."

Black theology deals primarily with the African-American community to make Christianity real for Blacks. It explains Christianity as a matter of liberation here and now, rather than in an afterlife. The goal of Black theology is not for special treatment. Instead, "All Black theologians are asking for is for freedom and justice. No more, and no less. In asking for this, the Black theologians, turn to scripture as the sanction for their demand. The Psalmist writes for instance, "If God is going to see righteousness established in the land, he himself must be particularly active as "the helper of the fatherless" (Psalm 10:14) to "deliver the needy when he crieth; and the poor that hath no helper" (Psalm 72:12).&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt;

Black theology would eventually develop outside of the United States to the United Kingdom and parts of Africa, especially addressing apartheid in South Africa.

== Black theology in the United States ==

{{main|James Hal Cone}}
[[James Hal Cone|James Cone]] first addressed this theology after [[Malcolm X]]'s proclamation in the 1950s against Christianity being taught as "a white man's religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/thisfarbyfaith/people/james_cone.html|title=James Cone|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Black religion expert Jonathan Walton:
&lt;blockquote&gt;James Cone believed that the New Testament revealed Jesus as one who identified with those suffering under oppression, the socially marginalized and the cultural outcasts. And since the socially constructed categories of race in America (i.e., whiteness and blackness) had come to culturally signify dominance (whiteness) and oppression (blackness), from a theological perspective, Cone argued that Jesus reveals himself as black in order to disrupt and dismantle white oppression.&lt;ref name="posner"&gt;{{cite web|last=Posner|first=Sarah|url=http://www.salon.com/2008/05/03/black_church/ |title=Wright's theology not 'new or radical'|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=May 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Black theology contends that dominant cultures have corrupted Christianity, and the result is a mainstream faith-based empire that serves its own interests, not God's. Black theology asks whose side should God be on—the side of the oppressed or the side of the oppressors. If God values justice over victimization, then God desires that all oppressed people should be liberated. According to Cone, if God is not just, if God does not desire justice, then God needs to be done away with. Liberation from a false god who privileges whites, and the realization of an alternative and true God who desires the empowerment of the oppressed through self-definition, self-affirmation, and self-determination is the core of Black theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cone|first=James H. |title=A Black Theology of Liberation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mqfsPwxuLrEC|year=2010|publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|isbn=978-1-60833-036-2|page=64-67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== On God and Jesus Christ ===
Intricate and largely philosophical views of God are largely ignored in preference for the concerns of the oppressed. The Old Testament God of Moses freeing the ancient Hebrews from Egyptian rulers was the central theme of African American popular religion, as well as abolitionists like [[Harriet Tubman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feiler|first=Bruce|year=2009|title=America's prophet: how the story of Moses shaped America|location=New York|publisher=Harper Perennial|pages=134–9|isbn=978-0-06-057488-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; White Christian concepts taught to black persons that they are to be disregarded or ignored.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The aspects of [[Trinity|God's person]], his power and authority, as well as "subtle indications of God's white maleness" are said{{by whom|date=March 2018}} not to relate to the black experience, to the extent of sometimes being [[antagonism (philosophy)|antagonistic]]. While trinitarian theology is a big concern, Jesus is still considered to be God. The focus is given to God's actions and his delivering of the oppressed because of his righteousness. [[Immanence]] is stressed over [[transcendence (religion)|transcendence]], and as a result God is seen to be "in flux" or "always changing".&lt;ref name=House&gt;Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine by H. Wayne House&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, Cone based much of his liberationist theology on God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt in the [[Book of Exodus]]. He compared the United States to Egypt, predicting that oppressed people will soon be led to a [[promised land]]. For Cone, the theme of Yahweh's concern was for "the lack of social, economic, and political justice for those who are poor and unwanted in society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cone|first=James H. |title=A Black Theology of Liberation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mqfsPwxuLrEC|year=2010|publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|isbn=978-1-60833-036-2|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cone also says that the same God is working for the oppressed Blacks of the 20th century, and that "God is helping oppressed Blacks and has identified with them, God Himself is spoken of as 'Black'."&lt;ref name="rhodes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~ronrhodes/BlackTheology.html|title= Black Theology, Black Power, and the Black Experience |first=Ron |last=Rhodes |date=Spring 1991|publisher=Christian Research Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cone saw Christ from the aspect of oppression and liberation. Cone uses the Gospel of Luke to illustrate this point: "the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the good news preached to them" (Luke 7:22). "'In Christ,' Cone argues, 'God enters human affairs and takes sides with the oppressed. Their suffering becomes his; their despair, divine despair.'"&lt;ref name="rhodes"/&gt; Cone also argues that, "We cannot solve ethical questions of the twentieth century by looking at what Jesus did in the first. Our choices are not the same as his. Being Christians does not mean following 'in his steps.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cone|first=James H. |title=Black Theology and Black Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FOgAs4hcbn8C|year=2008|publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|isbn=978-1-60833-037-9|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cone objected to the persistent portrayal of Jesus as White. "It's very important because you've got a lot of white images of Christ. In reality, Christ was not white, not European. That's important to the psychic and to the spiritual consciousness of Black people who live in a ghetto and in a white society in which their lord and savior looks just like people who victimize them. God is whatever color God needs to be in order to let people know they're not nobodies, they're somebodies." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=James H. Cone|last=Reynolds|first=Barbara|publisher=''USA Today''|date=November 8, 1989|page=11A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stylistic differences in the Black religious community ===
Because of the differences in thought between the Black and White community, most Black religious leaders attempt to make their services more accessible to other African-Americans, who must identify with the faith in order to accept it. Another notable difference is Cone's suggestion as to what must occur if there is not reconciliation among the White community. He states, "Whether the American system is beyond redemption we will have to wait and see. But we can be certain that Black patience has run out, and unless White America responds positively to the theory and activity of Black Power, then a bloody, protracted civil war is inevitable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cone|first=James H. |title=Black Theology and Black Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FOgAs4hcbn8C|year=2008|publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, NY|isbn=978-1-60833-037-9|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black theology is considered by some to be a form of racism{{by who|date=August 2018}}, as some followers associate liberation with retribution and anger[[weasel words]]. Some suggest that this is a response to the discomfort some White Americans feel with the ideas of Black empowerment and threat of being dealt with unapologetically as equals. It should also be noted that Christ forgave his oppressors and there is no focus on retribution for past wrong in the writings of Cone and other leaders.

=== Criticisms ===
Anthony Bradley of the ''[[Christian Post]]'' interprets that the language of "economic parity" and references to "mal-distribution" as nothing more than channeling the views of Karl Marx. He believes James Cone and [[Cornel West]] have worked to incorporate Marxist thought into the Black church, forming an ethical framework predicated on a system of oppressor class versus a victim much like Marxism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.acton.org/commentary/443_marxist_roots_of_black_liberation_theology|title=The Marxist roots of Black Liberation Theology|first=Anthony B.|last=Bradley|date= April 2, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405004249/http://www.acton.org:80/commentary/443_marxist_roots_of_black_liberation_theology.php|archive-date=April 5, 2008|publisher=Acton Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trinity United Church of Christ, Chicago]] has been cited in the press and by Cone as the best example of a church formally founded on the vision of Black theology. The 2008 [[Jeremiah Wright controversy]], over alleged racism and anti-Americanism in Wright's sermons and statements, caused then-Senator [[Barack Obama]] to distance himself from his former pastor.&lt;ref name="posner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/05/01/opinion/edderber.php|title=The 'Wright problem'|last1=Derber|first1=Charles|last2=Magrass|first2=Yale|date=May 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley Kurtz]] of the [[National Review]] wrote about the perceived differences with 'conventional American Christianity'. He quoted Black theologian Obery M. Hendricks Jr.: "According to Hendricks, 'many good church-going folk have been deluded into behaving like modern-day Pharisees and Sadducees when they think they're really being good Christians.' Unwittingly, Hendricks says, these apparent Christians have actually become 'like the false prophets of Ba'al.'" Kurtz also quotes the Rev. Jeremiah Wright: "How do I tell my children about the African Jesus who is not the guy they see in the picture of the blond-haired, blue-eyed guy in their Bible or the figment of white supremacists {{sic}} imagination that they see in Mel Gibson's movies?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/224530/left-church/stanley-kurtz?|title=Left in Church|author=Kurtz, Stanley|date=May 20, 2008|publisher=''[[National Review]]''|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Black theology in South Africa ==
Black theology was popularized in southern Africa in the early 1970s by [[Basil Moore (theologian)|Basil Moore]], a [[Methodist]] theologian in [[South Africa]]. It helped to give rise to, and developed in parallel with, the [[Black Consciousness Movement]]. Black theology was particularly influential in [[South Africa]] and [[Namibia]] for motivating resistance to [[apartheid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://universitypublishingonline.org/ref/id/companions/CBO9781139025560A023|title=The Cambridge Companion to Black Theology|last=Motlhabi|first=Mokgethi|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=9781139025560|editor-last=Hopkins|editor-first=Dwight N.|location=Cambridge|pages=221–233|chapter=The History of Black Theology in South Africa|doi=10.1017/ccol9780521879866.017|quote=|editor-last2=Antonio|editor-first2=Edward P.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement would also see be closely related to the South African [[Kairos Document]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vellem|first=Vuyani S.|date=2010|title=Prophetic Theology in Black Theology, with special reference to the ''Kairos document''|url=http://www.hts.org.za/index.php/HTS/article/view/800/1179|journal=HTS Teologiese Studies / Theological Studies|language=en|volume=66|issue=1|doi=10.4102/hts.v66i1.800|issn=2072-8050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Southern African black theologians include [[Barney Pityana]], [[Allan Boesak]], [[Itumeleng Mosala]] and [[Zephania Kameeta]].

In the African continent, black theology is often distinguished from [[African theology]].

== Black theology in Britain ==
In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Robert Beckford]] is a prominent black theology practitioner. He was the first in the UK to develop and teach a course on Black theology at an academic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://universitypublishingonline.org/ref/id/companions/CBO9781139025560A023|title=The Cambridge Companion to Black Theology|last=Reddie|first=Anthony|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=|editor-last=Hopkins|editor-first=Dwight N.|location=Cambridge|pages=234–244|chapter=The History of Black Theology in Britain|doi=10.1017/CCOL9780521879866.018|quote=|editor-last2=Antonio|editor-first2=Edward P.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is not limited to the British context, an [[academic journal]] which has been a key outlet for the discourse around Black theology in Britain has been ''Black Theology'', edited by [[Anthony G. Reddie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?journalCode=yblt20|title=Black Theology: An International Journal|last=|first=|date=|website=www.tandfonline.com|publisher=|access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5sDsCwAAQBAJ|title=Black Theology in Britain: A Reader|last=|first=|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781134964550|editor-last=Jagessar|editor-first=Michael N.|location=New York|pages=1–20|language=en|editor-last2=Reddie|editor-first2=Anthony G.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Canadian Civil Liberties Education Trust''' ('''CCLET''') is a [[charitable organization]] focused on the promotion and dissemination of knowledge and understanding amongst the general public of the [[rights]], [[liberties]] and duties of all citizens in [[democracies]].  CCLET was established in 1967 as the research and educational arm of the [[Canadian Civil Liberties Association]]. Its headquarters are in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].

CCLET provides free ''Civil Liberties in the Schools'' and ''Teaching Civil Liberties'' programmes across Ontario. Supported by a grant from the Law Foundation of Ontario, their programs present engaging and interactive civil liberties workshops and seminars in schools and faculties of education throughout Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Education Association Profile of CCLET {{cite web |url=http://www.cea-ace.ca/foo.cfm?subsection=edu&amp;page=pra&amp;subpage=ccl |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921182851/http://cea-ace.ca/foo.cfm?subsection=edu&amp;page=pra&amp;subpage=ccl |archivedate=2010-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the Socratic Paedogogical method, students are engaged in discussions about [[rights]], [[civil liberties]], duties of citizens, the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', and issues and controversies related to democratic societies. These projects help to develop the habits of democracy in young people through critical thinking, balancing of conflicting rights and freedoms, and the support of diverse opinions and views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= McLaughlin|first1= Danielle|year= 2005|title= Cultivating Habits of Democracy: Asking the Hard Questions|journal= Education Canada|volume= 45|issue= 1|pages= 33–35|publisher= Canadian Education Association|url= http://www.cea-ace.ca/sites/cea-ace.ca/files/EdCan-2005-v45-n1-McLaughlin.pdf|accessdate= 6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Compass was originally founded as Urban Compass in late 2012.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/12/16/urban-compass/ |title=With $8M in Seed Funding From Founders Fund, Goldman Sachs; Urban Compass Wants To Build A Hyper-Local, Human-Powered Database |first=Ingrid |last=Lunden |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company raised $8mm of seed fundraising from Founder's Fund, Thrive Capital, Goldman Sachs as well as several individual investors including [[American Express]] CEO [[Kenneth Chenault]], and [[ZocDoc]] CEO [[Cyrus Massoumi]].&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="theverge.com" /&gt; The initial business model employed full-time, salaried brokers, who users of the platform could schedule appointments online with after searching for listings on the company's desktop or mobile app.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/7/4304374/urban-compass |title=Urban Compass: can a startup finally fix the nightmare of renting an apartment in NYC? |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company publicly debuted at an event in May 2013, where then-New York City Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] helped celebrate the launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/07/urban-compass-debuts-a-hyperlocal-social-network-and-a-rental-portal-to-serve-as-its-magnet/ |title=Urban Compass Comes Out Of Stealth with a Hyperlocal Social Network, And A Disruptive Rental Portal That Will Serve As A Magnet |first=Ingrid |last=Lunden |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/real-estate/nyc-tech-start-up-urban-compass-launches-real-estate-focused-site-article-1.1337613 |title=NYC tech start-up Urban Compass launches real estate focused site |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company initially focused only on rentals.&lt;ref name="nydailynews.com" /&gt;

In September 2013, the company raised a Series A financing round of $20M, at a reported valuation of $150M.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/25/urban-compass-series-a/ |title=Hyperlocal Power: Urban Compass Raises $20M at A$150M Valuation; Adds Advance Publications And Marc Benioff As Investors |first=Ingrid |last=Lunden |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Investors including [[Advance Publications]], the CEO of [[Salesforce.com]], [[Marc Benioff]], and .406 Ventures all invested in Compass at this stage.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pehub.com/2013/09/new-york-city-startup-urban-compass-raises-20-mln-series-a-funds/ |title=-  New York City startup Urban Compass raises $20 mln in Series A funds |website=www.pehub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 2014, Compass announced they would enter the real estate sales business and a change in their overall business model, contracting independent real estate agents and taking a cut of the commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.inman.com/2014/01/15/the-big-pivot-why-urban-compass-has-gone-traditional/ |title=The big pivot: why Urban Compass has gone traditional |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, Compass raised a Series B financing round of $40M, this time at a valuation of $360M according to Bloomberg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/21/urban-compass-raises-40m-series-b/ |title=Urban Compass Raises $40M To Expand Its Apartment Marketplace Beyond NYC |first=Colleen |last=Taylor |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. Shortly following, Compass signed a lease on 25,000 square feet at 90 5th Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://commercialobserver.com/2014/07/urban-compass-signs-lease-at-rfrs-90-fifth-avenue/ |title=Urban Compass Signs Lease at RFR's 90 Fifth Avenue |date=22 July 2014 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The firm also hired Leonard Steinberg, a top-ranked real estate broker, from [[Douglas Elliman]] to serve as its president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://therealdeal.com/2014/06/02/leonard-steinberg-exiting-douglas-elliman-for-urban-compass/ |title=Leonard Steinberg exits Douglas Elliman for Urban Compass |date=2 June 2014 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rew-online.com/2014/06/20/whos-news-17/ |title=WHO'S NEWS – Real Estate Weekly |date=20 June 2014 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard Steinberg was named the agent with the highest sales volume in 2016 by Real Trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.inman.com/2016/06/24/real-trendswsj-thousand-list-2016-unveiled/ |title=The Real Trends/WSJ Thousand list for 2016 has been unveiled |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company reported having 125 agents and 70 staff at this time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.inman.com/2014/11/15/urban-compass-launches-nationwide-expansion-push-with-washington-d-c-acquisition/&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2015, Compass raised a Series C financing round of $50M at a reported valuation of $800M. The investment was led by [[Institutional Venture Partners]].&lt;ref name="therealdeal.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://therealdeal.com/2015/09/15/compass-raises-50m-in-series-c-now-valued-at-800m/ |title=Compass raises $50M in Series C; now valued at $800M |date=15 September 2015 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also opened offices in Brooklyn, South Florida, Boston and The Hamptons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://therealdeal.com/miami/2015/08/21/compass-opens-first-sofla-office-on-lincoln-road/ |title=Compass opens first SoFla office on Lincoln Road |date=21 August 2015 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://therealdeal.com/2014/09/10/urban-compass-picks-up-top-team-from-citi-habitats/ |title=Urban Compass picks up top team from Citi Habitats |date=10 September 2014 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.inman.com/2015/09/30/compass-riding-50m-funding-round-into-boston/ |title=Compass riding $50M funding round into Boston |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://therealdeal.com/2015/09/04/compass-turns-to-the-hamptons-where-rivals-roam/ |title=Compass turns to the Hamptons, where rivals roam |date=4 September 2015 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="therealdeal.com" /&gt;

In August 2016, Compass raised a Series D financing round of $75M, led by [[Wellington Management]], which brought its valuation to north of $1B.&lt;ref name="businessinsider.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/compass-raises-funding-worth-over-1-billion-2016-8 |title=This startup that wants to blow up the real-estate market is now worth more than $1&amp;nbsp;billion |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-31/compass-said-to-win-1-billion-valuation-as-new-unicorns-become-rarer |title=Compass Earns $1 Billion Valuation As New Unicorns Become Rarer |date=31 August 2016 |publisher= |via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also launched a new mobile app that offers real-time data on the real estate market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/compass-real-estate-startup-launches-new-app-2016-7 |title=This $800&amp;nbsp;million startup just launched an app to make buying a home easier |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the year, the company expanded into Aspen with the acquisition of Shane Aspen Real Estate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aspentimes.com/news/tech-company-compass-acquires-shane-aspen-real-estate/ |title=Tech company Compass acquires Shane Aspen Real Estate |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://therealdeal.com/la/2016/07/18/compass-to-launch-la-new-dev-division-on-heels-of-hana-cha-hire/ |title=Compass to launch LA new dev division on heels of Hana Cha hire |date=18 July 2016 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports also cited Compass’ expansion into Santa Barbara&lt;ref name="businessinsider.com" /&gt; and San Francisco&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://therealdeal.com/2016/09/02/compass-now-claims-its-agents-account-for-8b-in-sales-but-whats-that-number-made-of/ |title=Compass now claims its agents account for $8B in sales -- but what's that number made of? |date=2 September 2016 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as several other smaller sub-markets of their other major metro areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/compass-raises-funding-worth-over-1-billion-2016-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 2017, Compass hired several new executives to its leadership team, including Madan Nagaldinne, a former [[Facebook]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] executive as Chief People Officer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rew-online.com/2017/08/23/compass-hires-facebook-alumnus-to-steer-recruitment-strategy/ |title=Compass hires Facebook alumnus to steer recruitment strategy – Real Estate Weekly |date=23 August 2017 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Craig Anderson, a former Flywheel executive as chief financial officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20170830/REAL_ESTATE/170839997/real-estate-tech-firm-compass-replaces-chief-financial-officer |title=Compass replaces chief financial officer |first=Peter |last=D'Amato |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Compass announced $100M Series E Investment by [[Fidelity Investments]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; followed by Dec 7th, 2017 announcement of $450M investment by [[SoftBank Group|Softbank]] Vision Fund, later bringing the company valuation to $2.2B.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Compass also expanded into Chicago in late November, signing the city's number one real estate team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/realestate/20171128/CRED0701/171129920/citys-top-selling-residential-broker-team-jumps-to-new-in-town-firm |title=City's top-selling residential broker team jumps to new-in-town firm |work=Crain's Chicago Business |access-date=2017-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Compass announced aggressive expansion plans to 9 more cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.inman.com/2017/11/07/compass-reveals-plans-for-massive-expansion-futuristic-signage/ |title=Compass reveals plans for massive expansion |work=Inman |access-date=2017-12-25 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than a year later in September 2018, Compass announced a $400M Series F at a valuation to $4.4B.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/27/safe-as-houses-compass-400m-real-estate-unicorn/ |title=Compass nabs $400M, valuing the real estate technology startup at $4.4B |work=TechCrunch |access-date=2018-09-28 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series was led by [[SoftBank Group|Softbank]] Vision Fund and [[Qatar Investment Authority]], other investors included, [[Wellington Management Company|Wellington Management]], [[Institutional Venture Partners]] and [[Fidelity Investments]].

The '''Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls''' ('''CoCom''') was established by [[Western bloc]] powers in the first five years&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal|url=http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/jaas/periodicals/JJAS/PDF/1991/No.04-127.pdf |author=Yasuhara, Y. |title=The Myth of Free Trade: The Origins of COCOM 1945–1950 |journal=The Japanese Journal of American Studies |year=1991 |volume=4 |pages=127–148 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040730220532/http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/jaas/periodicals/JJAS/PDF/1991/No.04-127.pdf |archivedate=2004-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  after the end of [[World War II]], during the [[Cold War]], to put an [[arms embargo]] on [[Comecon]] countries. CoCom ceased to function on March 31, 1994, and the then-current control list of embargoed goods was retained by the member nations until the successor, the [[Wassenaar Arrangement]], was established.

== Membership ==
CoCom had 17 member states:

=== Laws and regulations ===
In the United States, CoCom compliance was implemented in the 1960s via the [[Arms Export Control Act]] (AECA) and the State Department's regulatory supervision on AECA via [[International Traffic in Arms Regulations]] (ITAR), which are still in effect.

==Violations==
{{main|Toshiba-Kongsberg scandal}}
[[Toshiba|Toshiba Machine Company]] of [[Japan]] and [[Kongsberg Group]] of [[Norway]] supplied eight computer-guided propeller milling machines to the [[Soviet Union]] between 1982 and 1984, an action that violated the CoCom regulations.  The [[United States]]' position is that this greatly improved the ability of Soviet submarines to evade detection. Congress moved to sanction Toshiba, and ban imports of its products into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Roderick|last=Seeman|title=Toshiba Case—CoCom - Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Revision|date=April 1987|publisher=The Japan Lawletter|url=http://japanlaw.info/lawletter/april87/fdf.htm|accessdate=18 September 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927102631/http://japanlaw.info/lawletter/april87/fdf.htm|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In GPS technology, the term "COCOM Limits"  also refers to a limit placed on GPS tracking devices that disables tracking when the device calculates that it is moving faster than {{convert|1000|kn}} at an altitude higher than {{convert|18000|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ravtrack.com/GPStracking/cocom-gps-tracking-limits/469/ | title=COCOM GPS Tracking Limits |publisher=RAVTrack.com| date=October 6, 2010| author=js |accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was intended to prevent the use of GPS in [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]-like applications.

Some manufacturers apply this limit only when both speed and altitude limits are reached, while other manufacturers disable tracking when either limit is reached. In the latter case, this causes some devices to refuse to operate in very high altitude balloons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.jgc.org/2010/11/gaga-1-cocom-limit-for-gps.html | title=GAGA-1: CoCom limit for GPS | publisher=jgc.org |first=John |last= Graham-Cumming |accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Crusader Kings II''''' is a [[Grand strategy wargame|grand strategy game]] set in the [[Middle Ages]], [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Paradox Development Studio]] and [[video game publisher|published]] by [[Paradox Interactive]] as a sequel to ''[[Crusader Kings (video game)|Crusader Kings]]''. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on February 14, 2012. An [[OS X]] version, Paradox Interactive's first in-house development for the [[operating system]], was released on May 24, 2012. A [[Linux]] version was also released on January 14, 2013.

It has sold over 1 million copies, which made it Paradox's most successful release before [[Europa Universalis IV]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/crusader-kings-ii/how-crusader-kings-2-caught-paradox-by-surprise|title=How Crusader Kings 2 caught Paradox by surprise|last=Zacny|first=Rob|date=September 20, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922004213/http://www.pcgamesn.com/crusader-kings-ii/how-crusader-kings-2-caught-paradox-by-surprise|archivedate=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The game is a [[dynasty]] [[simulator]] where the player controls a [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] dynasty from 1066 to 1453, though the [[downloadable content|DLC]] ''The Old Gods'' and ''Charlemagne'' allow for earlier start dates of 867 and 769, respectively. Through the strategic use of war, marriages and assassinations among many other things, the player works to achieve success for their dynasty. The game contains numerous historical figures such as [[William the Conqueror]], [[Charlemagne]], [[Genghis Khan]], [[Harold Godwinson]], [[Robert Guiscard]], [[Robert the Bruce]], [[Harald Hardrada]], [[El Cid]], [[Constantine X Doukas]], [[Harun al-Rashid]], [[Alexios I Komnenos]], [[Richard the Lionheart]], [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Alfred the Great]], [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]], and [[Saladin]], but allows for the player to choose less significant figures such as minor dukes and counts, and creation of entirely new characters with the use of the "Ruler Designer" DLC.

Success is defined solely by the player. The only in-game objective is to obtain as many prestige and piety points as possible in order to surpass the various historically relevant European dynasties in a fictional prestige ranking (the three most prestigious ones being the [[House of Capet|Capetian]], the [[Rurikid|Rurikovich]] and the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] dynasties). The game ends when the player's current character dies without an heir of the same dynasty to succeed him/her, when all landed titles of the count rank or above are stripped from all members of the player's dynasty (including themselves), or when the game reaches its end in 1453.

The game employs a genetics and education system where children will inherit many traits, culture, religion and skills from their parents and guardian. This adds an additional layer of strategy to marriages, such that a player will attempt not only to form beneficial alliances, but also to select marriage partners with strong heritable traits to maximise the quality of offspring and thus strengthen the dynasty. This requires balancing sometimes conflicting interests. For example, while one possible marriage might allow some [[Marriage alliances|desirable alliance]] to be formed with another ruler, it may also require marrying a spouse with some undesirable traits. Such a trade-off can occur in the reverse as well: one possible spouse could possess highly desirable traits but yield no new alliances for the player's dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/pc/2011/02/09/crusader-kings-2-preview/2 |title=Crusader Kings 2 PC Preview |author=Joe Martin |publisher=bit-tech |date=February 9, 2012 |accessdate=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the player can choose any noble with at least a county in their possession to play as, there are some government types that are unplayable without [[Mod (video gaming)|modding]] the game. These include theocracies (such as [[Pope|The Papacy]]), holy orders, mercenaries, and republics. The [[Maritime republics|merchant republic]] government type, however, is playable with ''The Republic'' expansion. In addition, all non-[[Christianity|Christian]] characters are unplayable without the purchase of the DLC that unlocks them, including [[Muslim]]s, [[Jews]], [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Taoism|Taoists]], [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], [[Jainism|Jains]], [[Zunism|Zunists]] and various [[Paganism|Pagans]].

==Modding==
When a Crusader Kings II (CK2) game is launched, Paradox servers collect information about the game setup such as game version, single player or multiplayer, and what mods are in use.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/ck2-dev-diary-49-mods-and-mod-telemetry.1016606/|title=CK2 Dev Diary #49: Mods and mod telemetry|last=|first= |date=2018-01-18|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data collected on 23 April 2017 showed that at least 42% of users on that day had activated at least one mod.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Data also reveals that multiplayer "[[Cheating in video games|cheat mods]]" are popular too, as are graphics or [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] mods.

It was established in 1955. The committee has three main objectives:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=84745 Statute 320 of 14/5-1997]&lt;/ref&gt;

* to follow the development of the language
* to answer inquiries about the Danish language and its use
* to update the official Danish dictionary, ''[[Retskrivningsordbogen]]''

The working members of the committee follow written and broadcast media, read books to keep track of new words and record their usage. New words which have appeared enough in print and speech to be considered notable are added to ''Retskrivningsordbogen'', which all government institutions and schools are obliged by law to follow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=84769 Statute 322 of 14/5-1997]&lt;/ref&gt; The committee receives some 14,000 inquiries by phone or mail each year about the [[Danish language]], half of them from private companies, but also by private citizens.

Dansk Sprognævn cooperates on a daily basis with its equivalents in the other [[Scandinavia]]n countries, the [[Swedish Language Council|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian Language Council]]s, to make sure that the three [[North Germanic languages|Mainland Scandinavian languages]], which are more or less mutually intelligible, do not diverge more than necessary from one another.

A '''diplomatic mission''' or '''foreign mission'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/ofm/property/fmc/c53113.htm|title=What is a Foreign Mission /Chancery?|website=www.state.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a group of people from one [[Sovereign state|state]] or an organisation present in another state to represent the sending state/organisation officially in the receiving state. In practice, a [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] mission usually denotes the resident mission, namely the '''embassy''', which is the main office of a country's diplomatic representatives to another country, usually but not necessarily the receiving state's [[Capital (political)|capital]] city. [[Consulates]], on the other hand, are smaller diplomatic missions which are normally located outside the capital of the receiving state (but can be located in the capital, usually when the sending country has no embassy in the receiving state). As well as being a diplomatic mission to the country in which it is situated, it may also be a non-resident permanent mission to one or more other countries. There are thus resident and non-resident embassies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TdSOAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22diplomatic+mission%22+-wikipedia+%22non-resident%22&amp;dq=%22diplomatic+mission%22+-wikipedia+%22non-resident%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BIlvTbTLGIeZhQeHgIlQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAjgo Tom Nierop, ''Systems and Regions in Global Politics''] (Wiley, John and Sons 1994 {{ISBN|978-0-471-94942-8}}), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Russian Federation has diplomatic relations with a total of 187 countries, but some of them – mainly for financial reasons – maintain non-resident embassies in other countries", [https://books.google.com/books?id=87e5AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22diplomatic+mission%22+-wikipedia+%22non-resident%22&amp;dq=%22diplomatic+mission%22+-wikipedia+%22non-resident%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zrNuTaCUKMiHhQe6kOk-&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBTge ''International Affairs''], issues 4–6 (Znanye Pub.

==Naming==
A permanent diplomatic mission is typically known as an embassy, and the head of the mission is known as an [[ambassador]] or [[high commissioner (Commonwealth)|high commissioner]]. The term "embassy" is commonly used also as a section of a building in which the work of the diplomatic mission is carried out, but, strictly speaking, it is the diplomatic delegation itself that is the embassy, while the office space and the diplomatic work done is called the [[chancery (diplomacy)|chancery]]. Therefore, the embassy operates in the chancery.

The members of a diplomatic mission can reside within or outside the building that holds the mission's chancery, and their private residences enjoy the same rights as the premises of the mission as regards inviolability and protection. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf|title=1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, article 30|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All missions to the [[United Nations]] are known simply as permanent missions, while [[EU member states]]' missions to the [[European Union]] are known as permanent representations, and the head of such a mission is typically both a permanent representative and an ambassador. European Union missions abroad are known as EU delegations. Some countries have more particular naming for their missions and staff: a [[Holy See|Vatican]] mission is headed by a [[nuncio]] ([[Latin]] for "envoy") and consequently known as an [[apostolic nunciature]]. Under the rule of [[Muammar Gaddafi]], [[Foreign relations of Libya|Libya's missions]] used the name "people's bureau", headed by a secretary.

Missions between [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries are known as high commissions, and their heads are high commissioners.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrRdc5SI_R4C&amp;pg=PT50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=33|title=Introduction To Tourism And Hospitality Industry|author=Sidhur Andrews|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|date= 1 Jun 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, ambassadors and high commissioners are regarded as equivalent in status and function and embassies and high commissions are both deemed to be diplomatic missions. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/diplomatic-and-consular-representations/|title=Diplomatic and Consular Representations|first=Jim S.|last=Nutt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpahq.org/cpahq/cpadocs/cpa%20address%20140311.pdf|title=Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, "What does the work of a High Commissioner involve?"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the past a diplomatic mission headed by a lower-ranking official (an ''envoy'' or ''minister resident'') was known as a ''[[legation]]''. Since the ranks of envoy and minister resident are effectively obsolete, the designation of ''legation'' is no longer used today. (See [[diplomatic rank]].)

A [[Consul (representative)|consulate]] is similar to, but not the same as a diplomatic office, but with focus on dealing with individual persons and businesses, as defined by the [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]]. A consulate or consulate general is generally a representative of the embassy in locales outside of the capital city.&lt;ref name=name/&gt; For instance, the United Kingdom has its [[Embassy of the United Kingdom in Washington, D.C.]], but also maintains seven consulates-general and four consulates elsewhere in the US. The person in charge of a consulate or consulate-general is known as a consul or consul-general, respectively. Similar services may also be provided at the embassy (to serve the region of the capital) in what is normally called a consular section.

In cases of dispute, it is common for a country to [[Letter of credence|recall]] its head of mission as a sign of its displeasure.  This is less drastic than cutting diplomatic relations completely, and the mission will still continue operating more or less normally, but it will now be headed by a [[chargé d'affaires]] (usually the [[deputy chief of mission]]) who may have limited powers. A chargé d'affaires ad interim also heads the mission during the interim between the end of one chief of mission's term and the beginning of another.

==Extraterritoriality==
[[File:Diplomatic Corps seal - Corps Diplomatique emblem logo.png|thumb|upright=0.45|right|Seal of a [[diplomatic corps]]]]
Contrary to popular belief, most diplomatic missions do not enjoy full [[extraterritorial status]] and – in those cases – are not sovereign territory of the represented state.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://integrity-legal.com/legal-blog/miscellaneous/laws-and-rules-regarding-extraterritoriality/ Laws and Rules Regarding Extraterritoriality]' on integrity-legal.com: "There is a common misconception that Embassies and Consulates have extraterritoriality. As anecdotal evidence of this misconception, people will often say things like, 'the US Embassy sits upon United States soil.' For the most part, this is not the case as extraterritoriality is not conferred upon an Embassy or Consulate, but in some situations extraterritoriality may be created by Treaty".&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather, the premises of diplomatic missions usually remain under the jurisdiction of the host state while being afforded special privileges (such as immunity from most local laws) by the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]].  Diplomats themselves still retain full [[diplomatic immunity]], and (as an adherent to the Vienna Convention) the host country may not enter the premises of the mission without permission of the represented country, even to put out a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diplomacy.state.gov/discoverdiplomacy/diplomacy101/places/170537.htm|title=What is a U.S. Embassy?|website=diplomacy.state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  International rules designate an attack on an embassy as an attack on the country it represents.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  The term "extraterritoriality" is often applied to diplomatic missions, but normally only in this broader sense.

As the host country may not enter the representing country's embassy without permission, embassies are sometimes used by [[refugee]]s escaping from either the host country or a third country.  For example, [[North Korea]]n nationals, who would be arrested and deported from China upon discovery, have sought sanctuary at various third-country embassies in China. Once inside the embassy, diplomatic channels can be used to solve the issue and send the refugees to another country. See the [[list of people who took refuge in a diplomatic mission]] for a list of some notable cases.

Notable violations of embassy extraterritoriality include repeated invasions of the British Embassy, Beijing (1967),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first= |date=15 August 2012 |title=Sir Ray Whitney |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/9478296/Sir-Ray-Whitney.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |access-date=17 August 2015 |quote=Red Guards scaled the British mission's wall as diplomats watched the Ealing comedy ''Two-Way Stretch''.

Whitney and his colleagues retreated again to the embassy's secure zone, with heavily barred windows. The Chinese set fire to the mission, then used a battering ram on the steel emergency door.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Iran hostage crisis]] (1979–1981), and the [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis]] at the ambassador's residence in [[Lima]], [[Peru]] (1996-1997).

==Role==
[[File:Embassy of Nicaragua.JPG|thumb|Embassy of Nicaragua in Washington, D.C.|[[Embassy of Nicaragua in Washington, D.C.]].]]The Vienna Convention states:&lt;blockquote&gt;The functions of a diplomatic mission consist, inter alia, in representing the sending State in the receiving State; protecting in the receiving State the interests of the sending State and of its nationals, within the limits permitted by international law; negotiating with the Government of the receiving State; ascertaining by all lawful means conditions and developments in the receiving State, and reporting thereon to the Government of the sending State; promoting friendly relations between the sending State and the receiving State, and developing their economic, cultural and scientific relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf|title=Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relationships, article 3|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Diplomatic missions between members of the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]] are not called embassies, but [[high commission (Commonwealth)|high commission]]s, as Commonwealth nations share a special diplomatic relationship. It is generally expected that an embassy of a Commonwealth country in a non-Commonwealth country will do its best to provide diplomatic services to citizens from other Commonwealth countries if the citizen's country does not have an embassy in that country. Canadian and Australian nationals enjoy even greater cooperation between their respective consular services, as outlined in [[Canada-Australia Consular Services Sharing Agreement]]. The same kind of procedure is also followed multilaterally by the member states of the [[European Union]] (EU). European citizens in need of consular help in a country without diplomatic or consular representation of their own country may turn to any consular or diplomatic mission of another EU member state.

The rights and immunities (such as [[diplomatic immunity]]) of diplomatic missions are codified in the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]].

==Multiple missions in a city==
Some cities may host more than one mission from the same country.  An example is Rome, where many states maintain missions to [[Foreign relations of Italy|Italy]] and another to the [[Holy See]].  It is not customary for these missions to share premises nor diplomatic personnel. At present, only the [[Iraq]]i missions to Italy and the [[Holy See]] share premises; however, two ambassadors are appointed, one to each country. In the case of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|UN's Food Agencies]], the Head of Mission to the Italian Republic is usually accredited as [[permanent representative]]. The United States maintains a separate [[United States Mission to the UN Agencies in Rome]], whose head is the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture]]. Kolkata, India hosts two Bangladeshi Deputy High Commissions, one at [[Park Circus]] and another at Mirza Galib Street. This was done to reduce overcrowding inside the Deputy High Commission. At first the Park Circus was opened and later, the one at Mirza Galib Street. Now both the Deputy High Commissions issue Bangladeshi visa.

==Non-diplomatic offices==
{{main|De facto embassy}}

Governments of [[List of states with limited recognition|states not recognized by the receiving state]] and of territories that make no claim to be sovereign states may set up offices abroad that do not have official diplomatic status as defined by the Vienna Convention. Examples are the [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office]]s that represent the government of the [[Republic of China]]; [[Somaliland]]'s Representative Offices in London, [[Addis Ababa]], Rome, and [[Washington, D.C.]]; the [[Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office]]s that represent the government of that territory. Such offices assume some of the non-diplomatic functions of diplomatic posts, such as promoting trade interests and providing assistance to its citizens and residents. They are nevertheless not diplomatic missions, their personnel are not diplomats and do not have diplomatic visas, although there may be legislation providing for personal immunities and tax privileges, as in the case of the Hong Kong offices in London and Toronto, for example.

{{Notability|date=November 2018}}
The '''F*ck Tea''' campaign, launched in August 2010 by [[The Agenda Project]], was aimed to dismiss the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] and promote the [[Progressivism|progressive]] cause. It involved a website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fucktea.com/|title=Fuck Tea|website=fucktea.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; merchandise such as [[mug]]s and [[T-Shirt]]s, polling statistics demonstrating the ignorance of the Tea Party, and a mocking video.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA7yluQDfpY  Fuck Tea Video]&lt;/ref&gt;
The name of the campaign was chosen in order to be provocative, to market the counter-movement, and to better engage typical Americans in the campaign.

According to founder [[Erica Payne]], the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] began in response to the bank bailouts to push against the bought-and-paid-for politicians, which she appreciated. However, they quickly turned to attacking healthcare and spouting rhetoric. They abandoned [[financial regulation]]. She felt it was irresponsible to begin a party based on an issue and then ignore it, so she created this initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Agenda Project, The.

{{Politics of the Netherlands}}
The '''Farmers' Party''' (in Dutch: ''Boerenpartij'', BP) was a [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch]] [[agrarianism|agrarian]] [[political party]], with a strong [[conservatism|conservative]] outlook and a [[populism|populist]] appeal. The BP was the first anti-establishment party elected into the Dutch [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] after the [[Second World War]].

==History==

===Foundation===
The precise foundation date of the BP is not known. In 1958 in several [[Gelderland]] [[municipalities]] "Free Farmers" lists contested in municipal elections. In 1959 the Farmers' Party officially applied at the Kiesraad to participate in the [[Dutch general election, 1959|1959 elections]], although the party was unable to win a seat. The founder of the party was [[Hendrik Koekoek]], the chair and founder of the Association for Freedom for Agricultural Business, also known as the "Free Farmers". The organization resisted increasing government intervention and the [[Publiekrechtelijke Bedrijfsorganisatie|institutionalization]] of farming. These also became important issues for the Farmers' Party.

===1963-1981===
In the [[Dutch general election, 1963|elections of 1963]] the Farmers' Party won three seats in the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]]. The party had gained considerable attention when the police had forcibly seized farms whose owners had not paid their taxes. Koekoek, the party's leader, came from the same region and acted as spokesperson for these farmers. With its populist appeal the party had been able to get the support from farmers and non-farmers, even from urban areas. He headed the party's list and became the chairperson of the parliamentary party. In 1966 the party won two seats in the [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]].

In parliament the Boerenpartij was troubled by internal struggles and splits. In 1966 it was revealed that one of the party's senators, Adams, had a [[Nazism|national socialist]] background, and had been a member of the [[Nationaal Socialistische Beweging|National Socialist Movement]] and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. Koekoek protected Adams against the allegations. In reaction to that Voogd, one of the party's MPs, left the party. Also a group of members from the party founded their own party, Emergency Council (''Noodraad'').

Both Emergency Council and Farmers' Party participated in the [[Dutch general election, 1967|1967 elections]], as did Voogd with his own list. Only the Farmers' party managed to secure representation with a total of seven seats, whilst both the Emergency Council and the List-Voogd ended up with no seats. In the next years Koekoek was (again) unable to keep his parliamentary party together. His authoritarian leadership caused four of the seven MPs to leave the party and to organize their own party, Right Allegiance (''Binding Rechts''). They were led by Harmsen, one of the founders of the Farmers' Party. One of these four MPs left his new party soon to work as an independent. In 1971 one of Koekoek's MPs also left his party, leaving only two MPs.

[[Image:BP-1972.jpg|thumb|150px|1972 election poster showing Koekoek]]
In the [[Dutch general election, 1971|1971 elections]] Koekoek obtained only one seat, and  Right Allegiance none. In the [[Dutch general elections, 1972|1972 elections]] the party won two additional seats. In the [[Dutch general election, 1977|1977 elections]] the party lost those two seats again, leaving only Koekoek.

===Dissolution===
Before the [[Dutch general election, 1981|elections of 1981]] the BP was renamed to Rightwing People's Party (''Rechtse Volkspartij'', RVP) but they were unable to win a seat.

==Ideology==
The party's main issue was the increasing government interference in, and the [[Publiekrechtelijke Bedrijfsorganisatie|institutionalization]] of, farming. Yet it was more than [[single issue]] [[agrarianism|agrarian interest]] party. It saw itself as a conservative party which championed [[political freedom|political]] and [[economic freedom]] in general, on basis of [[Nationalism|national]] and [[Christian values]]. It had a strong [[populism|populist]], [[anti-establishment]] appeal. Although some members had been active with [[fascism|fascist]] or [[national socialism|national socialist]] organizations before 1945 the party rejected [[racism]] and fascism. Piero Ignazi has defined its ideology as " a curious mixture of authoritarianism and individualism, anti-tax protest, and anti-parliamentarism, somewhat reminiscent of French ''[[Poujadism]]''". However he stressed that the party was not part of the extreme right.&lt;ref&gt;Piero Ignazi, ''Extreme Right Parties in Western Europe'', Oxford University Press, 2006, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

The party had a strong nationalist message: it was in favour of the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch monarchy]], opposed [[European integration]], wanted a strong [[Defense (military)|defense]], and believed that law and order should be maintained.

On economic matters the party was very conservative. It wanted to protect [[private property]] and encourage [[Individualism|private initiative]]. It sought to reduce [[Limited government|government influence]] on the economy and [[taxation]]. It felt that the [[welfare state]] should be reduced to a minimum, [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] should be cut, and that the agricultural sector would be able to support itself if the government interfered less.

==Organisation==
===Leadership===
This table shows the BP's results in elections to the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|House of Representatives]] and [[Senate of the Netherlands|Senate]], as well as the party's political leadership: the fractievoorzitter is the chair of the parliamentary party and the lijsttrekker is the party's top candidate in the general election, and these posts are normally taken by the party's leader.

===Municipal and Provincial Government===
The party has been able to win several seats in [[Provinciale Staten|provincial legislatures]] and in municipal councils. In several rural municipalities such as [[Apeldoorn]] the party was rather strong - Harmsen, one of the party's MPs, was a longtime [[wethouder|alderman]] there. However especially in the period 1965-1970 the party also managed to win municipal council seats in urban municipalities such as Amsterdam, where they scored 9.4% (or 4 of 45 seats) in 1966.

==Electorate==
The party drew most of its support from farmers and small business owners in rural areas. With its populist appeal the party had also been able to get support from small business owners in urban areas. In the 1963 elections the party polled 6,000 votes from Amsterdam.

==International Comparison==
As a conservative farmers' party, the Farmers' Party is similar to Eastern European farmers' parties, such as the [[Polish Peasant Party]]. The best comparison however can be made with the party of [[Pierre Poujade]] which was successful in the 1956 elections, but faded away afterwards. Like Poujade's party the Farmers' Party had a strong populist message which appealed to both farmers and small business.

'''Foday Saybana Sankoh''' (17 October 1937 &amp;ndash; 29 July 2003) was the criminal founder of the genocidal [[Sierra Leone]] rebel group [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF), which was supported by [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]]-led [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia|NPFL]] in the 11-year-long [[Sierra Leone Civil War]]. Starting in 1991 and ending in 2002. An estimated 50,000 people were killed during the war, and over 500,000 people were displaced in neighbouring countries.

==Early life and career==
Foday Sankoh was born on 17 October 1937, in the remote [[village]] of [[Masang Mayoso]], [[Tonkolili District]] in the [[Northern Province, Sierra Leone|Northern part]] of [[Sierra Leone]] to an [[ethnic]] [[Temne people|Temne]] father and a [[Loko people|Loko]] mother. Sankoh was the son of a farmer.

Sankoh attended primary and secondary school in [[Magburaka]], [[Tonkolili District]] and took on a number of jobs in Magburaka before he joined the Sierra Leone army in 1956. He undertook training in [[Nigeria]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1971, then a corporal in the Sierra Leone army, he was cashiered from the army's signal corps and imprisoned for seven years at the Pademba Road Prison in [[Freetown]] for taking part in a mutiny.

On his release he worked as an itinerant photographer in the south and east of Sierra Leone, eventually coming in contact with young radicals.

Sankoh and confederates Rashid Mansaray and Abu Kanu solicited support for an armed uprising to oust the APC government. They then traveled to Liberia, where they reportedly continued recruiting and served with [[Charles G. Taylor]]'s [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] (NPFL).

==Civil war==
{{main|Sierra Leone Civil War}}
On 23 March 1991, the RUF, led by Foday Sankoh and backed by [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]], launched its first attack in villages in [[Kailahun District]] in the diamond-rich [[Eastern Province, Sierra Leone|Eastern Province]] of Sierra Leone.

The RUF became notorious for brutal practices such as [[mass rape]]s and [[amputation]]s during the civil war. Sankoh personally ordered many operations, including one called "Operation Pay Yourself" that encouraged troops to loot anything they could find. After complaining about such tactics, Kanu and Mansaray were [[Summary execution|summarily executed]].

In March 1997, Sankoh fled to [[Nigeria]], where he was put under [[house arrest]] and then imprisoned. From this time until Sankoh's release in 1999, [[Sam Bockarie]] performed the task of director of military operations of the RUF. During the ten-year war, Sankoh broke several promises to stop fighting, including the [[Abidjan Peace Accord]] and the [[Lomé Peace Accord]] signed in 1999. Eventually the [[United Kingdom]] and [[ECOMOG]] intervened with their own small, but professional, military forces, and the RUF was eventually crushed.

=== Arrest and charges ===
Sankoh was later arrested on 17 May 2000 after his soldiers gunned down a number of protesters, killing 19 people, including journalist Saoman Conteh, outside his [[Freetown]] home on 8 May 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cpj.org/2001/03/attacks-on-the-press-2000-sierra-leone.php|title=Attacks on the Press 2000: Sierra Leone|date=19 March 2001|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists}}&lt;/ref&gt; His arrest led to massive celebrations throughout Sierra Leone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Aehotqx6lAA%3d&amp;tabid=187 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719181554/http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Aehotqx6lAA%3D&amp;tabid=187 |archivedate=2012-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sankoh was handed to the British. Under the [[jurisdiction]] of a [[United Nations|UN]]-backed court,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1437579/Foday-Sankoh.html&lt;/ref&gt; he was indicted on 17 counts for various [[war crimes]], including use of [[child soldiers]] and [[crimes against humanity]], including [[genocide|extermination]], [[enslavement]], [[rape]] and [[sexual slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Aehotqx6lAA%3d&amp;tabid=187 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120719181554/http://www.sc-sl.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Aehotqx6lAA%3D&amp;tabid=187 |archivedate=2012-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Sankoh died in hospital of complications arising from a [[stroke]] whilst awaiting trial on the night of 29 July 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/sierra-leone-rebel-leader-sankoh-dies-98360.html|publisher=The Independent|date=30 July 2003|title=Sierra Leone rebel leader Sankoh dies}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement by the UN-backed war crimes court, chief prosecutor David Crane said that Sankoh's death granted him "a peaceful end that he denied to so many others".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3110629.stm Foday Sankoh: The Cruel Rebel]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Free Aceh Movement''' ({{lang-id|Gerakan Aceh Merdeka}} or simply '''''GAM''''', {{lang-ace|Geurakan Acèh Meurdèka}}, also: Gěrakan Aceh Měrdeka&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |page=364
 |title=History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1200
 |first=M.C. |last=Ricklefs
 |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[separatism|separatist]] group seeking [[independence]] for the [[Aceh]] region of [[Sumatra]] from [[Indonesia]].  GAM fought against Indonesian government forces in the [[Insurgency in Aceh|Aceh insurgency]] from 1976 to 2005, during which over 15,000 lives are believed to have been lost.&lt;ref name="BBC_4690293"&gt;{{cite web |date= 17 July 2005&lt;!--, 14:25 GMT 15:25 UK--&gt;|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4690293.stm|title = Indonesia agrees Aceh peace deal|publisher = [[BBC News]]| accessdate = 11 October 2008 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The organisation surrendered its separatist intentions and dissolved its armed wing following 2005 peace agreement with the [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian Government]], and subsequently changed its name into '''Aceh Transition Committee''' (''Komite Peralihan Aceh'', '''''KPA'''''). The Indonesian government called the group the ''Aceh Security Disturbance Movement''.

==Background==
[[File:Teuku Daud Beureueh.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Teuku Daud Beureueh]]
The conflict in Aceh stems from several major factors including historical mistreatment, disagreements over [[Islamic law]], discontent over the distribution of Aceh's natural resource wealth, and the increase in the numbers of [[Javanese people]] in Aceh.&lt;ref name="BBC_3039243"&gt;{{cite web |date= 24 January 2005&lt;!--, 14:46 GMT--&gt;|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3039243.stm|title = Aceh's Gam separatists|publisher = [[BBC News]]| accessdate = 11 October 2008 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the era of [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonisation]] in the 1800s Aceh was a centre of resistance against Dutch colonial rule. The Acehnese resisted Dutch forces. They were one of the last [[Native Indonesians|Indonesian people]] to succumb to colonial rule and only after a brutal 30-year campaign, the [[Aceh War]] of 1873-1903.&lt;ref name="Ross_PDF_Report"&gt;{{cite web|year = 2007|url = http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/ross/ResourcesRebellion.pdf|title = Resources and Rebellion in Aceh, Indonesia|format = PDF|publisher = [[The World Bank]]|accessdate = 11 October 2008|last = Michael L.

Motivated by discovery of large gas reserves in [[Lhokseumawe]] and driven by inherent ethnic-chauvinism widespread amongst the Acehnese, a former [[Darul Islam (Indonesia)|Darul Islam]] "foreign minister", [[Hasan di Tiro]] established the Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka) in December 1976. The small movement carried out its first attack on [[Mobil Oil]] engineers in 1977, killing one American engineer. Due to this incident, GAM came under the attention of central government who sent small units of [[counter-insurgency]] troops that successfully crushed the movement. Di Tiro was nearly killed and was forced to flee to [[Malaysia]] while all members of his "cabinet" were either killed or forced to flee abroad by 1979.

Since its inception GAM has gone through three stages or three rises and falls. The first was at its birth in 1976 to the year 1979 when it was almost wiped out. The second rise and fall was in 1989 to the early 90s when it received funding and training from foreign countries. The third rise was a result of finally gaining widespread support throughout Aceh as a result of donations and extortion and a large group of potential soldiers who had lost relatives in the previous uprising.

===GAM I===
At first the guerilla war of GAM was quite unsuccessful. By 1977 the central government appeared to have entirely neutralised the group.&lt;ref name="Schulze_Book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirsten E. Schulze |title=The Free Aceh Movement (GAM): Anatomy of a Separatist Organization|edition=September 2004|pages=76 |publisher=East-West Center Washington| isbn=1-932728-02-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early GAM efforts were mainly directed at the local [[Exxon Mobil]] gas plant. Di Tiro had connections with the petroleum industry and even bid, via a tender process, on a contract to build a gas pipeline which was beaten by the gas giant [[Bechtel]].&lt;ref name="Ross_PDF_Report"/&gt; The reason for this failure was a lack of popular support from both within Aceh and from international sources. President Suharto was favoured by countries such as America due to his anti communist policies during the Cold War period.&lt;ref name="Schulze_Book"/&gt;

===GAM II===
The group renewed its activities in the 1989, apparently with financial support from [[Libya]] and [[Iran]], fielding around 1,000 soldiers.&lt;ref name="Ross_PDF_Report"/&gt; This training from overseas meant that GAM soldiers were much more organised and better trained than the previous insurgency. To counter this new threat Aceh was declared an "area of [[1990-98 Indonesian military operations in Aceh|special military operations]]" (Daerah Operasi Militer) or DOM in 1989.{{citation needed|date=October 2008}} Special counter- insurgency troops were sent in and Aceh was locked down. Villages that were suspected of harbouring GAM operatives were burnt down and family members of suspected militants were kidnapped and tortured.{{citation needed|date=October 2008}} Amnesty International called the military response "shock therapy"&lt;ref name="AI_ASA210851998en"&gt;{{cite web |date=25 August 1998|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa21/085/1998/en/|title=Indonesia: Human rights atrocities in Aceh|publisher=Amnesty International| accessdate=11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is believed 7,000 human rights abuses took place during DOM.{{citation needed|date=October 2008}} GAM forces have also been suspected of Human Rights abuses. Extra judicial executions of suspected military informants and targeting of civilian infrastructure such as schools have both been attributed to GAM operations.{{citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In 1996 the Indonesian government announced the end of GAM.,&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"&gt;{{cite web |year=2008 |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/aceh.htm|title=Free Aceh Movement [Gerakin Aceh Merdeka (GAM)] |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org| accessdate=11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the counter-insurgency operations had effectively destroyed GAM as a guerilla force. Surviving GAM members were forced to hide in [[Malaysia]].

===GAM III===
[[File:Free Aceh Movement women soldiers.jpg|thumb|250px|Female soldiers of the Free Aceh Movement with GAM commander Abdullah Syafei'i, 1999]]
The fall of [[Suharto]] in 1998 and the decision of his successor President [[Jusuf Habibie]] to withdraw troops from Aceh as part of democratic reform gave space for GAM to re-establish itself, recruiting youths by exploiting brutality stories of [[Indonesian military]]. Increasing violence beginning in 1999 by GAM rebels against government officials and [[Java]]nese residents, buoyed by massive weapons smuggling from [[Thailand]] by the GAM, led to an increase in military presence. Troop numbers are believed to have risen during the rule of [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]]. In 2001–02 the combination of military and police forces in Aceh had grown to about 30,000. In one year this number jumped to 50,000 operating in what the International Crisis group called, "a virtual legal vacuum".&lt;ref name="Ross_PDF_Report"/&gt; The security crackdowns during this time resulted in several thousand civilian deaths.&lt;ref name="Five Key Dilemmas"&gt;Barakat, S Connolly, D &amp; Large, J. ''Winning and Losing in Aceh: Five Key Dilemmas in Third-Party Intervention''. Frank Crass London&lt;/ref&gt; The government launched a large [[2003–04 Indonesian offensive in Aceh]] against the GAM in 2003 with some success.

==Peace negotiations==
The leaders of GAM, [[Hasan di Tiro]], and his chief deputy, [[Zaini Abdullah]], and Malik Mahmud lived in exile in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] for most of the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="BBC_3039243"/&gt; The group's main Indonesian spokesman was Abdullah Syafei'i Dimatang.&lt;ref name="BBC_3039243"/&gt; In the late 1990s GAM began peace talks with Jakarta, brokered by the Swedish government.

In 1999 it was reported that the group had split into two factions, GAM (representing the original group) and the [[Free Aceh Movement Government Council]] [[(MP-GAM)]].&lt;ref&gt;Michelle A. Miller. (2008). Rebellion and Reform in Indonesia. Jakarta's Security and Autonomy Policies in Aceh, Routledge, London, pp.78-79. {{ISBN|978-0-415-45467-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was denied by GAM spokespersons but was widely reported in the Indonesian media.&lt;ref&gt;Details of the split and some activities of the MP-GAM in Malaysia are discussed in detail in Missbach, Antje (2012), ''Separatist Conflict in Indonesia: The long-distance politics of the Acehnese diaspora'', London and New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-66896-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2002, GAM and GoI signed a breakthrough [[Cessation of Hostilities Agreement]] (COHA) which only held for a few months before violations started occurring. The mediator in these negotiations, the [[Henry Dunant Centre]] for [[International Dialogue]] (HDC) did not have proper monitoring and enforcing mechanisms to enact sanctions for violations.&lt;ref&gt;Huber, K, 2004, The HDC in Aceh: Promises and pitfalls of NGO mediation and implementation, East-West Center, Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002-2004, the GAM was severely hit by a series of [[2003-2004 Indonesian offensive in Aceh|government offensives]] in which the organisation lost approximately 50% of its members including its commander, Abdullah Syafei'i Dimatang, who was killed in a military ambush on January 2002.

On Tuesday, 28 December 2004, in the aftermath of the devastation caused by a [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|massive tsunami]], GAM declared a ceasefire of hostilities to allow for aid to reach within the disputed area. In turn, the Indonesian government temporarily removed restrictions of northern Sumatra to allow for rescue efforts in that area.

Other Aceh [[separatism|separatist]] groups exist and there was some tension between them and GAM over tactics and GAM's monopoly of negotiations with the government.

On 27 February 2005, the Free Aceh Movement and the delegation of the Indonesian government started another round of peace talks in [[Vantaa]], [[Finland]], moderated by former [[President of Finland|Finnish president]] [[Martti Ahtisaari]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamid Awaludin, Minister for Law and Human Rights between October 2004 and May 2007, was leader of the Indonesian Government delegation for the negotiations. A detailed account is set out in Hamid Awaludin, ''Peace in Aceh: Notes on the peace process between the Republic of Indonesia and the Aceh Freedom Movement (GAM) in Helsinki'', [[Centre for Strategic and International Studies (Indonesia)|CSIS]], Jakarta, 2009, translated by Tim Scott, {{ISBN|978-979-1295-11-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 July 2005, the Indonesian Minister of Communication and GAM announced a peace deal to end the thirty-year [[insurgency]].

The peace agreement was officially signed on 15 August 2005 in the [[Finnish Government Banquet Hall]]  in [[Helsinki]]&lt;ref name=CMI&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Acehin rauhansopimuksesta 10 vuotta  | url = http://www.cmi.fi/fi/media-fi/uutiset/1059-acehin-rauhansopimuksesta-10-vuotta  | accessdate = 3  November 2015  | language = fi  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105210750/http://www.cmi.fi/fi/media-fi/uutiset/1059-acehin-rauhansopimuksesta-10-vuotta  | archivedate = 5 January 2016  | df = dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  by chief Indonesian negotiator [[Hamid Awaluddin]] and GAM leader [[Malik Mahmud]].&lt;ref name="BBC_4690293"&gt;{{cite web |date= 17 July 2005&lt;!--, 14:25 GMT 15:25 UK--&gt;|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4690293.stm|title = Indonesia agrees Aceh peace deal|publisher = [[BBC News]]| accessdate = 11 October 2008 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Ahtisaari was the witness of the peace treaty.

Under the terms of the agreement, both sides agreed to cease all hostilities immediately. GAM also agreed to disarm, while the Government pledged to withdraw all non-local military and police by the end of 2005. An Aceh Monitoring Mission was set up by the [[European Union|EU]] and [[ASEAN]] to oversee the process of disarmament and the reintegration into society of GAM members.&lt;ref name="Waizenegger"&gt;pp. 411-427 - {{cite web |volume=32 |issue=3 |date=July 2007|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/tran/2007/00000032/00000003/art00009|title = Peace in the wake of disaster? Secessionist conflicts and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami|publisher = Blackwell Publishing| accessdate = 11 October 2008 | last=Billon, P, Waizenegger |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A presidential decree granted amnesty to about five hundred former GAM members who were in [[exile]] in other countries, and unconditionally released about 1,400 members who had been jailed by the Government.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The Government agreed to facilitate the establishment of Aceh-based political parties; this had been one of the most contentious issues in previous negotiations.  A "truth and reconciliation commission" will be organised. On the question of the uneven distribution of income, it was settled that seventy percent of the income from local natural resources will stay within Aceh.

On 27 December 2005, the leaders of the Free Aceh Movement announced that they had disbanded their military wing.&lt;ref name="BBC_4561922"&gt;{{cite web |date= 27 December 2005&lt;!--, 11:10 GMT--&gt;|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4561922.stm|title = Aceh rebels disband armed units|publisher = [[BBC News]]| accessdate = 11 October 2008 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The action, which took effect immediately, follows from earlier peace talks and the destruction of 840 weapons by international observers, Free Aceh movement commander Sofyan Daud told reporters, "The Aceh national army is now part of civil society, and will work to make the peace deal a success."   As a sign of how the peace process was progressing the founder of Aceh's separatist rebel movement, Hasan di Tiro, returned to Indonesia on 11 October 2008 after nearly 30 years in exile.&lt;ref name="aljazeer_2008101144652814370"&gt;{{cite web |date= 11 October 2008|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2008/10/2008101144652814370.html|title = Exiled Aceh leader returns |publisher = [[aljazeera]]| accessdate = 11 October 2008 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006 elections==
{{main|Acehnese regional election, 2006}}
During the election of 11 December 2006, the Free Aceh Movement temporarily split into two factions each supporting its own candidate for governorship. One side supported [[Zaini Abdullah]]'s brother, and the other side supported [[Irwandi Yusuf]], a former GAM negotiator. Irwandi Yusuf got more support from the grass root level and won the election.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Hillman, 'Aceh's Rebels Turn to Ruling', Far Eastern Economic Review, Vol. 170, No. 1, January–February 2007, 49-53.&lt;/ref&gt; The losing faction proceeded to bide its time, aiming to make a comeback in the next gubernatorial election in Aceh due at the end of Irwandi's five-year term in 2011.  In the event, the gubernatorial election due to be held at the end of 2011 was delayed by procedural squabbling as different factions scrambled for advantage. The elections took place in April 2012.

==2012 elections==
{{main|Acehnese gubernatorial election, 2012}}
The 2012 election, held on 9 April, was largely a continuation of post-agreement rivalries between former GAM leaders, with [[Zaini Abdullah]] having returned from exile and entered into the contest for the governorship against Irwandi. Zaini Abdullah, with the strong support of the Aceh Party, won the election with a substantial majority.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38815">{{Politics of East Timor}}
[[East Timor]] is a multiparty parliamentary republic with a population of approximately 1.1 million,&lt;ref&gt;Government of Timor-Leste, [http://timor-leste.gov.tl/?p=4144&amp;lang=en&amp;lang=en], “2010 Census Results: Timor-Leste’s population grows slower than projected”, 22 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; sharing the island of [[Timor]] with Indonesia's Nusa Tenggara province. During the 24 years of Indonesian occupation (from 1975,) and after the 1999 independence referendum, pro Indonesian militias committed many human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA57/003/2011/en], “Timor-Leste; Justice Delayed, Justice Denied”, 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The country gained independence in 2002, and free and fair elections were held in 2007. The [[United Nations Integrated Mission in East Timor]] (UNMIT) and the International Stabilization Force remain in the country while it develops its own security forces, the National Police (PNTL) and Defence Forces (F-FDTL).&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor; U.S. Department of State, [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eap/154404.htm], “2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practice; Timor-Leste”, 8 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of issues concerning [[civil and political rights]] including breaches of the right to a fair trial and freedom from arbitrary arrest. The delivery of economic, social and cultural rights is also a concern, such as the right to education, and the right to family life; there is little respect for the rights of women and children and domestic violence and sexual abuse are major problems.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor; U.S. Department of State, [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eap/154404.htm], “2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practice; Timor-Leste”, 8 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International treaties==
East Timor joined the [[United Nations]] (UN) in 2002 and is a party to seven of the nine core human rights treaties: the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] (ICERD), [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR), [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR), [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]] (CEDAW), [[Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment]] (CAT)) and [[International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families]] (ICRMW)). It has not ratified the [[International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance]] (CED) or the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (CRPD)).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bayefsky.com/html/timorleste_t1_ratifications.php Timor-Leste Ratification History]&lt;/ref&gt; Its first [[Universal Periodic Review]] was held in October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Development Programme Timor-Leste, [http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/TLSession12.aspx], “Timor-Leste Prepares First Human Rights Assessment for UPR”, 10 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

East Timor has ratified optional protocols of international treaties, including the [[First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], the [[Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and the [[Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict]] and [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography]] of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].

==Constitutional protections==
The constitution enacted in 2002 is comprehensive, however more systems need to be put in place before the rights detailed in the constitution can be said to be guaranteed, for example the right to private property, health, and education is still not realised for many, and there is inefficient delivery of the right to a hearing and defence, free consent to marriage, and freedom to assemble,&lt;ref&gt;Government of Timor-Leste, [http://timor-leste.gov.tl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Constitution_RDTL_ENG.pdf], “Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste”.&lt;/ref&gt; as detailed below.

==Failures of justice==
The country's inefficient legal system has raised human rights concerns. In 2010, the country was reported to have issues with lack of fair trials, the use of excessive force by police, and a pervading sense of impunity for past human rights breaches.&lt;ref name="2010StateDepartmentReport"&gt;Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor; U.S. Department of State, [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eap/154404.htm], “2010 Country Reports on Human Rights Practice; Timor-Leste”, 8 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The judicial system suffers from a lack of staffing and resources, thus even though the law prohibits arbitrary arrest and detention, incarceration may occur because judges are unavailable, and there are long delays until people are heard at trial.&lt;ref name="2010StateDepartmentReport"/&gt; There are also significant comprehension difficulties as although Tetum and Portuguese are both official languages of East Timor, Portuguese is the main legal language, which most of the population does not speak.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA57/003/2011/en], “Timor-Leste; Justice Delayed, Justice Denied”, 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been reports of the police and defence force breaching the rights of civilians through cruel or degrading treatment such as beatings, excessive use of force, intimidation and threats made at gunpoint. Allegations of prison guards mistreating prisoners have also been made.&lt;ref name="2010StateDepartmentReport"/&gt;

Fighting between the police and defence force led to violent riots in 2006 resulting in civilian displacement and deaths.&lt;ref&gt;UN News Centre, [https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=36342&amp;Cr=timor&amp;Cr1],
“Timor-Leste has made strides in bolstering human rights, UN report finds”, 5 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, in 2008 the commander of the Military Police, Alfredo Reinado, led an armed attack on the Prime Minister and President, leading to a state of emergency being declared and necessitating the creation of a Joint Command in order to stem the violence and human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch, [https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2009/timor-leste], “Timor-Leste; Events of 2008”.&lt;/ref&gt; However, significantly, the President commuted the sentences of those responsible for the 2006 riots,&lt;ref&gt;UN News Centre, [https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=36342&amp;Cr=timor&amp;Cr1],
“Timor-Leste has made strides in bolstering human rights, UN report finds”, 5 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and pardons were given to those involved with the 2008 violence,&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA57/003/2011/en], “Timor-Leste; Justice Delayed, Justice Denied”, 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; creating a perception of impunity, and the subsequent vetting process has not resulted in any dismissals for past human rights violations.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA57/003/2011/en], “Timor-Leste; Justice Delayed, Justice Denied”, 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Training programmes have resulted in some improvements,&lt;ref&gt;UN News Centre, [https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=36342&amp;Cr=timor&amp;Cr1],
“Timor-Leste has made strides in bolstering human rights, UN report finds”, 5 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; although allegations of human rights violations by the police and military continue to be made.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA57/003/2011/en], “Timor-Leste; Justice Delayed, Justice Denied”, 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, reconciliation with Indonesia has been pursued rather than focusing on criminal prosecutions for crimes committed during the 1975-1999 occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/timor-leste-president-would-support-international-tribunal-0], “Timor-Leste President would support international tribunal”, 8 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor (''Comissão de Acolhimento, Verdade e Reconciliação''), and the Commission of Truth and Friendship merely brought the truth to the fore rather than seeking prosecution for crimes including unlawful killings, enforced disappearances, sexual violence, torture, and war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA57/003/2011/en], “Timor-Leste; Justice Delayed, Justice Denied”, 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However José Ramos-Horta has accused "the UN of "hypocrisy" for using his government's stance on justice as a pretext for not setting up the tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/press-releases/timor-leste-president-would-support-international-tribunal-0], “Timor-Leste President would support international tribunal”, 8 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Serious Crimes Investigation Team continues to investigate violations committed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, [https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ASA57/003/2011/en], “Timor-Leste; Justice Delayed, Justice Denied”, 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of expression==
In East Timor freedom of speech and freedom of the press are protected by law, and this is generally respected by the government. There is also an active independent media operating mainly through television and radio, although there is limited access to televisions and radios, and reception problems limit broadcasting outside of Dili and the district capitals.&lt;ref name="2010StateDepartmentReport"/&gt;

==Freedom of assembly==
East Timor law requires that four days' notice be given to the police before any demonstrations or strikes, and demonstrations are barred within 100 yards of government buildings or diplomatic facilities. However, in practice demonstrations are allowed without the advanced notifications, and the 100 yard regulation is rarely enforced.&lt;ref name="2010StateDepartmentReport"/&gt;

==Political participation==

===Constitutional context===

Rights to political participation are stated in article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which guarantees rights to take part in public affairs, free and universal suffrage, and generally equal access to public service roles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/ccpr.pdf International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] (opened for signature 16 December 1966, entered into force 23 March 1976), art 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

These rights are largely upheld in Timor-Leste. Section 46 of the Constitution of Timor-Leste states that "every citizen has the right to participate in the political life and in the public affairs of the country"; that every "citizen has the right to establish and to participate in political parties"; and that "the establishment and organisation of such parties shall be regulated by law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://timor-leste.gov.tl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Constitution_RDTL_ENG.pdf Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste 2002], s 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 47 guarantees that every citizen above the age of seventeen has the [[right to vote]] and be elected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timor-leste.gov.tl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Constitution_RDTL_ENG.pdf Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste 2002],  s 47.&lt;/ref&gt; and section 48 guarantees the right of citizens to submit "petitions, complaints and claims" to authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timor-leste.gov.tl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Constitution_RDTL_ENG.pdf Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste 2002],  s 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 election was contested by 21 parties. Voter turnout was high, with 77 percent of Timorese voting&lt;ref&gt;Khoo Ying Hooi "After Timore-Leste's election, a Young Democracy Looks Forward" The Diplomat (July 25 2017) [http://thediplomat.com/2017/07/after-timor-lestes-election-a-young-democracy-looks-forward/ &lt;www.thediplomat.com&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; compared to 74 percent in 2012, and 80 percent in 2007.&lt;ref name="2016StateDept"&gt;U.S. Department of State "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016" &lt;www.state.govt&gt; at 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Elections are held under a [[party-list proportional representation]] system, in which voters select parties rather than individual candidates, a system that gives substantial power to party leaders. The [[electoral threshold]] is 4%, meaning that political parties need at least 4 percent of the vote to enter parliament. This limits the power of some minor parties.&lt;ref name="Leach"&gt;Michael Leach "In Timor-Leste, more power-sharing likely but election hard to pick" Asia Pacific Report [https://asiapacificreport.nz/2017/07/20/in-timor-leste-more-power-sharing-likely-but-election-had-to-pick/ &lt;www.asiapacificreport.nz&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The system is supportive of female participation and there is a requirement for one third of a party's candidates to be women, resulting in Timor-Leste having one of the highest percentages of female MPs in the [[Asia Pacific]] region (38 percent prior to the 2017 election).&lt;ref name="Leach"/&gt; However, meaningful participation by women is sometimes constrained by traditional attitudes and stereotypes, particularly in local and regional roles.&lt;ref name="2016StateDept"/&gt;

There are no legal constraints on participation by the country's few ethnic minority groups and they appear to be well integrated into the political system, although the total number positions held by ethnic minorities is uncertain since self-identification of ethnicity is an uncommon practice.&lt;ref name="2016StateDept"/&gt;

The [[Economist Intelligence Unit]]'s [[Democracy Index]] rates East Timor consistently between 7.22-7.24 between 2008 and 2016, on a scale where 0 indicates a fully authoritarian regime and 10 indicates a perfect democracy. This rating is the highest in the South Pacific and is close to that of major democracies such as the United States (7.98) and France (7.92).&lt;ref&gt;The Economist "The Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy Index" [https://infographics.economist.com/2017/DemocracyIndex/ &lt;www.economist.com&gt;]. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===

Limitations on political participation in Timor-Leste are largely practical, as many areas of the country are hard to access due to geographical constraints and poor levels of roading infrastructure which can impact the ability of those in more remote areas to participate in elections.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Michael Leach "In Timor-Leste, more power-sharing likely but election hard to pick" Asia Pacific Report [https://asiapacificreport.nz/2017/07/20/in-timor-leste-more-power-sharing-likely-but-election-had-to-pick/ &lt;www.asiapacificreport.nz&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; This has limited the ability of smaller parties to compete in some areas, as the better funded CNRT and Fretilin are more able to transport their supporters to polling stations.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Michael Leach "In Timor-Leste, more power-sharing likely but election hard to pick" Asia Pacific Report [https://asiapacificreport.nz/2017/07/20/in-timor-leste-more-power-sharing-likely-but-election-had-to-pick/ &lt;www.asiapacificreport.nz&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a risk that political participation will decline due to the relative lack of progress in dealing with continuous domestic challenges and the lack of decentralisation to promote self-governance and self reliance, although so far this has not had a major impact.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Khoo Ying Hooi "The Importance of Timor-Leste's 2017 Elections" The Diplomat [http://thediplomat.com/2017/03/the-importance-of-timor-lestes-2017-elections/ &lt;www.thediplomat&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention of large political coalitions has also been identified as a potential risk to the health of Timor-Leste's democracy. Dr Michael Leach observes that since 2012, the two largest parties in government (the CNRT and Fretilin) have been in a 'grand coalition', a remarkable development since prior to the agreement, there were bitter tensions between the two parties.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Michael Leach "In Timor-Leste, more power-sharing likely but election hard to pick" Asia Pacific Report [https://asiapacificreport.nz/2017/07/20/in-timor-leste-more-power-sharing-likely-but-election-had-to-pick/ &lt;www.asiapacificreport.nz&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;   He notes that this recent trend towards coalitions is the result of a strong desire by Timorese politicians to facilitate stability after the instability and violence of previous years, although he also observes that such coalitions can risk undermining the accountability of the government due to the absence of a major opposition outside of government. In 2015 [[Francisco Guterres]] (the Fretilin candidate) was endorsed by prime minister [[Xanana Gusmão]], his erstwhile rival, and won with over 60 percent of the vote, showing that a large proportion of voters currently prefer the power sharing arrangement, despite its drawbacks.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Michael Leach "In Timor-Leste, more power-sharing likely but election hard to pick" Asia Pacific Report [https://asiapacificreport.nz/2017/07/20/in-timor-leste-more-power-sharing-likely-but-election-had-to-pick/ &lt;www.asiapacificreport.nz&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

The generational divide within government roles may pose a significant challenge in the next few years. While posts such as the prime minister and chief justice are held by the younger generation, it appears that the veterans of the "1975 generation" retain most of the power behind the scenes, limiting the effectiveness of later generations to influence political society. Leach predicts this will gradually change in future elections as a greater proportion of voters come from generations with no experience of the struggle for independence.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Michael Leach "In Timor-Leste, more power-sharing likely but election hard to pick" Asia Pacific Report [https://asiapacificreport.nz/2017/07/20/in-timor-leste-more-power-sharing-likely-but-election-had-to-pick/ &lt;www.asiapacificreport.nz&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The relative ineffectiveness of the Timorese judiciary in promoting and upholding rights has led to many citizens and civil society seeking other methods to realise their rights and political participation through lobbying has become more common due to its effectiveness in achieving results, although this depends on the priorities of the politicians involved.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Grenfell "Realising Rights in Timor Leste" (2015) 39:2 Asian Studies Review 266 at 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Land rights ==

===Constitutional context===
Land issues are currently the third largest source of complaints to the PDJH, Timor-Leste's national human rights institution.&lt;ref&gt;Khoo Ying Hooi "Silverio Pinto Baptista on Human Rights Challenges in Timor-Leste" The Diplomat [http://thediplomat.com/2017/03/silverio-pinto-baptista-on-human-rights-challenges-in-timor-leste/ &lt;www.thediplomat.com&gt;.] &lt;/ref&gt; Until 1 June 2017 there was no overarching land law to regulate such issues.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Timor-Leste "Enactment of Land Law major step for Development" [http://timor-leste.gov.tl/?p=18216&amp;lang=en &lt;www.timor-leste.gov.tl&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 54 of the Constitution of Timor-Leste guarantees the right to private property. It also states that private property should not be used to the detriment of its social purpose, that only national citizens have the right to ownership of land,
and that "requisitioning and expropriation of property for public purposes shall only take place
following fair compensation in accordance with the law".&lt;ref&gt;[http://timor-leste.gov.tl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Constitution_RDTL_ENG.pdf Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste 2002],  art 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, however, these protections have not always been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016" [https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/265590.pdf &lt;www.state.govt&gt;] at 8.&lt;/ref&gt; While a specific right to land is not codified in international law, the issues involved cut across many rights.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Wickeri and Anil Kalhan "Land Rights Issues in International Human Rights Law" Institute for Human Rights and Business [https://www.ihrb.org/pdf/Land_Rights_Issues_in_International_HRL.pdf &lt;www.ihrb.org&gt;.] at 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In Timor-Leste these include non-discrimination, women's rights, rights to housing, and the right to work (due to the heavy reliance on agriculture).&lt;ref&gt;Khoo Ying Hooi "Silverio Pinto Baptista on Human Rights Challenges in Timor-Leste" The Diplomat [http://thediplomat.com/2017/03/silverio-pinto-baptista-on-human-rights-challenges-in-timor-leste/ &lt;www.thediplomat.com&gt;.] &lt;/ref&gt;

===Current issues===
Land issues are complicated by the legacy of the Portuguese and Indonesian occupations in the years prior to independence. During both regimes, land was confiscated from its traditional owners by force and consolidated into the hands of loyalists, a policy that created substantial ethnic and regional divisions.&lt;ref&gt; Meabh Cryan "Empty land? The Politics of Land in Timor-Leste" in Sue Ingram and Lia Kent and Andrew McWilliam A New Era? Timor-Leste after the UN (ANU Press 2015) 141 at 143.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Indonesian military withdrew from the country in 1999, the military and affiliated militia groups destroyed an estimated 70 per cent of existing structures and took the country's land records with them, resulting in a situation where many are without title to the land they live on.&lt;ref&gt;Meabh Cryan "Empty land? The Politics of Land in Timor-Leste" in Sue Ingram and Lia Kent and Andrew McWilliam ''A New Era? Timor-Leste after the UN'' (ANU Press 2015)   141 at 143. &lt;/ref&gt; High levels of population displacement as a result of the violence have further complicated matters. While a 2016 survey found that 87 per cent of residents in [[Dili]] considered themselves the owners of the land where they lived, only just over half of respondents said they had legal title to it.&lt;ref&gt;Bernardo Almeida and Todd Wassel "Survey on Access to Land, Tenure Security and Land Conflicts in Timor-Leste" (December 2016) Asia Foundation [http://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Survey-on-Access-to-Land-Tenure-Security-and-Land-Conflicts-in-Timor-Leste-1.pdf &lt;www.asiafoundation.org&gt;] at 4. &lt;/ref&gt; The problem is even more severe in the countryside, where many hold land only through customary and informal systems, systems that have no legal recognition. Resource and staffing constraints have also resulted in a substantial backlog in the courts, making it difficult to seek a legal remedy and there have been reported cases of abuse from the security services in conducting evictions.&lt;ref&gt;Bernardo Almeida and Todd Wassel "Survey on Access to Land, Tenure Security and Land Conflicts in Timor-Leste" (December 2016) Asia Foundation [http://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Survey-on-Access-to-Land-Tenure-Security-and-Land-Conflicts-in-Timor-Leste-1.pdf &lt;www.asiafoundation.org&gt;] at 4. &lt;/ref&gt; According to this survey, despite high levels of perceived ownership, the majority of households in Dili fear to varying degrees that they will be evicted in five years.&lt;ref&gt;Bernardo Almeida and Todd Wassel "Survey on Access to Land, Tenure Security and Land Conflicts in Timor-Leste" (December 2016) Asia Foundation [http://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Survey-on-Access-to-Land-Tenure-Security-and-Land-Conflicts-in-Timor-Leste-1.pdf &lt;www.asiafoundation.org&gt;] at 5. &lt;/ref&gt;

Government land acquisitions for development projects, particularly in the [[Oecusse District|Oecusse]] and [[Cova Lima District|Suia]] districts, have been heavily criticised by NGOs, particularly for disregarding many private claims and evicting residents from land where the title is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016" [https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/265590.pdf &lt;www.state.govt&gt;] at 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 2017 law, government policy did not provide compensation for confiscated land that the occupier did not have title to. While this policy was not always maintained in practice, compensation in any case has been inconsistent and some Suai communities have complained that the alternative housing provided by the government did not meet their needs and the resulting relocations significantly changed their lives and cultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016" [https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/265590.pdf &lt;www.state.govt&gt;] at 8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

These practices risk breaching Timor Leste’s obligations under the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], both of which it has ratified. Article 11.1 of the ICESCR states that “everyone has the right to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including food, housing and water”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights] (opened for signature 16 December 1966, entered into force 3 January 1976), art 11.1&lt;/ref&gt;, whilst Article 17.1 of the ICCPR states that “everyone has the right not to be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home, or correspondence”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/ccpr.pdf International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights] (opened for signature 16 December 1966, entered into force 23 March 1976), art 17.1&lt;/ref&gt; However, the U.S. Department of State notes that the Timorese government typically prefers to prioritise matters of perceived national importance over those of human rights and while some action has been taken to prosecute those involved in abuses, public perceptions of impunity persist.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of State "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016" [https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/265590.pdf &lt;www.state.govt&gt;] at 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were four recommendations from other countries regarding land issues in Timor Leste's 2016 Universal Periodic Review.&lt;ref&gt;UPR Info "Database of Recommendations:
 Timor-Leste" [https://www.upr-info.org/database/index.php?limit=0&amp;f_SUR=174&amp;f_SMR=All&amp;order=&amp;orderDir=ASC&amp;orderP=true&amp;f_Issue=All&amp;searchReco=&amp;resultMax=300&amp;response=&amp;action_type=&amp;session=&amp;SuRRgrp=&amp;SuROrg=&amp;SMRRgrp=&amp;SMROrg=&amp;pledges=RecoOnly www.upr-info.org]&lt;/ref&gt; There were three recommendations to take measures to eliminate gender discrimination and women's rights to land ownership while Indonesia recommended the completion of statutes to protect human rights including land.&lt;ref&gt;UPR Info "Database of Recommendations:
 Timor-Leste" [https://www.upr-info.org/database/index.php?limit=0&amp;f_SUR=174&amp;f_SMR=All&amp;order=&amp;orderDir=ASC&amp;orderP=true&amp;f_Issue=All&amp;searchReco=&amp;resultMax=300&amp;response=&amp;action_type=&amp;session=&amp;SuRRgrp=&amp;SuROrg=&amp;SMRRgrp=&amp;SMROrg=&amp;pledges=RecoOnly www.upr-info.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Timor-Leste accepted three recommendations and noted Canada's recommendation to remove discriminatory provisions from legislation.&lt;ref&gt;UPR Info "Database of Recommendations:
 Timor-Leste" [https://www.upr-info.org/database/index.php?limit=0&amp;f_SUR=174&amp;f_SMR=All&amp;order=&amp;orderDir=ASC&amp;orderP=true&amp;f_Issue=All&amp;searchReco=&amp;resultMax=300&amp;response=&amp;action_type=&amp;session=&amp;SuRRgrp=&amp;SuROrg=&amp;SMRRgrp=&amp;SMROrg=&amp;pledges=RecoOnly www.upr-info.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reforms===
The Timorese government has acknowledged the need for reform. In its 2016 report as part of the [[Universal Periodic Review]], it acknowledged that the right to property is enshrined in Article 54.1 of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Timor-Leste "National Report" [https://www.upr-info.org/sites/default/files/document/timor-leste/session_26_-_november_2016/a_hrc_wg.6_33_tls_1_e.pdf &lt;www.upr-info.org&gt;] at 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Government affirmed its intentions to continue the development of a land law package to protect these rights and the creation of a real estate fund, in part to provide appropriate compensation for land acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Timor-Leste "National Report" [https://www.upr-info.org/sites/default/files/document/timor-leste/session_26_-_november_2016/a_hrc_wg.6_33_tls_1_e.pdf &lt;www.upr-info.org&gt;] at 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 February 2017 the National Parliament of Timor-Leste unanimously approved the ''Special Regime for the Ownership of Immovable Property'', more commonly known as the 'Land Law', and it was officially enacted on the 1 June 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Timor-Leste "Enactment of Land Law major step for Development" [http://timor-leste.gov.tl/?p=18216&amp;lang=en &lt;www.timor-leste.gov.tl&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the law is “to clarify the legal status of land ownership by bringing into effect the different dimensions of the right to private property provided for in the Constitution of Timor-Leste”.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Timor-Leste "Enactment of Land Law major step for Development" [http://timor-leste.gov.tl/?p=18216&amp;lang=en &lt;www.timor-leste.gov.tl&gt;.]&lt;/ref&gt; It also provides criteria for the resolution of ownership disputes and will create a National Land Registry to manage property titles. As of September 2017, there have been no major reports on the effectiveness of the law in achieving these objectives.

==Women's rights==
In East Timor, women are often deemed to have a lesser status than men,&lt;ref&gt;Asia Pacific Online Network of Women in Politics, Governance and Transformative Leadership, [http://www.onlinewomeninpolitics.org/womensit/et-women-sit.pdf], “Women’s Rights in East Timor (2001)”.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the constitution guaranteeing equality.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Timor-Leste, [http://timor-leste.gov.tl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Constitution_RDTL_ENG.pdf], “Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste”, ss 16 &amp; 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Portugal and Indonesia in their role as colonists created and maintained traditional patriarchal social structures, marginalising women.&lt;ref&gt;Asia Pacific Online Network of Women in Politics, Governance and Transformative Leadership, [http://www.onlinewomeninpolitics.org/womensit/et-women-sit.pdf], “Women’s Rights in East Timor (2001)”.&lt;/ref&gt; Girls are only sent to school for a few years,&lt;ref&gt;Asia Pacific Online Network of Women in Politics, Governance and Transformative Leadership, [http://www.onlinewomeninpolitics.org/womensit/et-women-sit.pdf], “Women’s Rights in East Timor (2001)”.&lt;/ref&gt; and young girls are sometimes forced into arranged marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/co/CRC-C-TLS-CO-1.pdf], “Concluding Observations: Timor Leste; CRC/C/TLS/CO/1”, 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in some regions tradition prevents women from inheriting or owning property,&lt;ref&gt;Asia Pacific Online Network of Women in Politics, Governance and Transformative Leadership, [http://www.onlinewomeninpolitics.org/womensit/et-women-sit.pdf], “Women’s Rights in East Timor (2001)”.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the right being guaranteed in the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Timor-Leste, [http://timor-leste.gov.tl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Constitution_RDTL_ENG.pdf], “Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste”, s 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual and domestic violence is also one of the major human rights concerns in the country.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste, [http://unmit.unmissions.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=pylFCrJl59g%3D&amp;tabid=826&amp;mid=884], “Report on Human Rights Developments in Timor-Leste; August 2006 – August 2007”.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vulnerable Person's Unit within the PNTL is responsible for receiving and investigating allegations of sexual violence, however investigations are often delayed due to a lack of resources and institutional support, and cases are often resolved through traditional dispute resolution mechanisms,&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, [http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Countries/UNMIT200808.pdf], “Report on human rights developments in Timor-Leste; September 2007 – 30 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; which do not provide full redress to victims.&lt;ref&gt;Asia Pacific Solidarity Network, [http://www.asia-pacific-solidarity.net/southeastasia/easttimor/reports/ai_humanrightsineasttimor2011.htm], 
“Human rights in Timor-Leste”, May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A continuing effort on behalf of the government, the UN, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs,) has resulted in some improvement,&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste, [http://unmit.unmissions.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=pylFCrJl59g%3D&amp;tabid=826&amp;mid=884], “Report on Human Rights Developments in Timor-Leste; August 2006 – August 2007”.&lt;/ref&gt; and the recently introduced Law Against Domestic Violence should assist by providing a framework for government, police and community responses to domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;Asia Pacific Solidarity Network, [http://www.asia-pacific-solidarity.net/southeastasia/easttimor/reports/ai_humanrightsineasttimor2011.htm], 
“Human rights in Timor-Leste”, May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's rights==
There are major issues regarding abuse of children, lack of education and high levels of malnourishment. Child abuse, including physical and psychological abuse and sexual violence is a serious problem in East Timor.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste, [http://unmit.unmissions.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=pylFCrJl59g%3D&amp;tabid=826&amp;mid=884], “Report on Human Rights Developments in Timor-Leste; August 2006 – August 2007”.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, corporal punishment is still used to discipline children at school and at home.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/co/CRC-C-TLS-CO-1.pdf], “Concluding Observations: Timor Leste; CRC/C/TLS/CO/1”, 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of incidents of violence against children are not formally reported and there are inadequate judicial remedies.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/co/CRC-C-TLS-CO-1.pdf], “Concluding Observations: Timor Leste; CRC/C/TLS/CO/1”, 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been reports of commercial sexual exploitation of minors,&lt;ref name="2010StateDepartmentReport"/&gt; and child labour is widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/co/CRC-C-TLS-CO-1.pdf], “Concluding Observations: Timor Leste; CRC/C/TLS/CO/1”, 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in some instances, parents have indentured their children in order to settle debts.&lt;ref name="2010StateDepartmentReport"/&gt;

Although the constitution states that primary education is compulsory,&lt;ref&gt;Government of Timor-Leste, [http://timor-leste.gov.tl/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Constitution_RDTL_ENG.pdf], “Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste”, s 59.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no legislation establishing a minimum level of education, nor a system to ensure free education is provided. Statistics from the UN in 2009 showed that approximately 20 percent of primary school-age children nationwide were not enrolled in school, with even higher levels of non-enrolment in rural areas.&lt;ref name="2010StateDepartmentReport"/&gt;
&lt;
There are also high levels of child malnutrition and infant and child mortality, which the government, in conjunction with [[UNICEF]], is working towards reducing through the “national nutrition strategy”.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/co/CRC-C-TLS-CO-1.pdf], “Concluding Observations: Timor Leste; CRC/C/TLS/CO/1”, 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped that the newly established East Timor National Commission on Child Rights, mandated to promote, defend, and monitor child rights will improve the situation.&lt;ref name="2010StateDepartmentReport"/&gt;

==National human rights institutions==
The national institution of human rights is the ''Provedor de Direitos Humanos e Justiça'' (The Provedor for Human Rights and Justice (PDHJ),)&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/co/CRC-C-TLS-CO-1.pdf], “Concluding Observations: Timor Leste; CRC/C/TLS/CO/1”, 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  which has played a key role in promoting and protecting rights since its establishment in June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;UN News Centre, [https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=36342&amp;Cr=timor&amp;Cr1],
“Timor-Leste has made strides in bolstering human rights, UN report finds”, 5 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste, [http://unmit.unmissions.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=pylFCrJl59g%3D&amp;tabid=826&amp;mid=884], “Report on Human Rights Developments in Timor-Leste; August 2006 – August 2007”.&lt;/ref&gt; Its mandate is to investigate complaints of human rights violations, maladministration and corruption, and to carry out monitoring, advocacy and promotional activities.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste, [http://unmit.unmissions.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=pylFCrJl59g%3D&amp;tabid=826&amp;mid=884], “Report on Human Rights Developments in Timor-Leste; August 2006 – August 2007”.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a need for a PDHJ presence in the regions, as at present complainants from the districts need to travel to Dili to lodge complaints, thus inhibiting the process.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste, [http://unmit.unmissions.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=pylFCrJl59g%3D&amp;tabid=826&amp;mid=884], “Report on Human Rights Developments in Timor-Leste; August 2006 – August 2007”.&lt;/ref&gt; In the districts where the ''Provedoria'' is not yet established, NGO members often fulfill the role of monitoring rights.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste, [http://unmit.unmissions.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=pylFCrJl59g%3D&amp;tabid=826&amp;mid=884], “Report on Human Rights Developments in Timor-Leste; August 2006 – August 2007”.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Parliament election, 2004|2004 European Parliament elections]] were reported as a good result for Eurosceptic parties.&lt;ref name="BBCN01"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3806503.stm Eurosceptics storm the citadel], [[BBC News Online]] report dated Monday, 14 June 2004, 18:01 GMT&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IHT20040615"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennhold |first=Katrin |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/06/15/union_ed3__2.php |title=Political divide is said to deepen further: Populist parties make big gains in EU vote, IHT, June 15, 2004 |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=15 June 2004 |accessdate=2010-06-17}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; 37 MEPs (33&lt;ref name="Europarl20040720EN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/calendar/calendar?APP=PDF&amp;TYPE=PV1&amp;FILE=20040720EN.pdf&amp;LANGUE=EN|title=20040720EN European Parliament website|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 20 July, with four&lt;ref name="Europarl20040721EN"/&gt; more the next day) from the [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP), [[June Movement]] (Denmark), [[Movement for France]] (France), [[Lega Nord|Northern League]] (Italy), [[ChristianUnion – Reformed Political Party]] (Netherlands), [[Popular Orthodox Rally]] (Greece), [[June List]] (Sweden), [[Independent Democrats (Czech Republic)|Independent Democrats]] (Czech Republic), the [[League of Polish Families]] (Poland) and an Independent MEP from the Republic of Ireland, joined together in the first week of the new Parliament to form the Eurosceptic group called "Independence/Democracy" (IND/DEM), succeeding the group called "[[Europe of Democracies and Diversities]]" (EDD) that had existed during the European Parliament's [[Fifth European Parliament|1999–2004 term]].

In the first week, IND/DEM assigned a UKIP MEP to the [[Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality]]. The MEP, [[Godfrey Bloom]], promptly made comments including "No self-respecting small businessman with a brain in the right place would ever employ a lady of child-bearing age" and "I am here to represent Yorkshire women who always have dinner on the table when you get home. I am going to promote men's rights." The remarks engendered outrage from a range of fellow politicians.&lt;ref name="BBC3912205"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/uk_politics/3912205.stm UKIP MEP in row over working women], [[BBC News Online]] report dated Wednesday, 21 July 2004, 11:22 GMT&lt;/ref&gt;

One UKIP MEP never made it to IND/DEM. MEP [[Ashley Mote]] was expelled from UKIP&lt;ref name="Times459309"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article459309.ece UKIP plans alliance to scupper constitution, Times, 20 July 2004] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to IND/DEM's formation&lt;ref name="BBC3899969"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3899969.stm UKIP suspends fraud trial Euro MP], [[BBC News Online]] report dated Friday, 16 July 2004, 11:47 GMT&lt;/ref&gt; when it became known that he faced charges for housing benefit fraud.&lt;ref name="Times459309"/&gt; Mote went on to join the far-right [[Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty]] group before being convicted in 2007.&lt;ref name="Times2279582"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2279582.ece British MEP convicted for benefit fraud, Times, 17 August 2007] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Northern League MEPs eventually all left the group after their expulsion from IND/DEM following an incident involving a T-shirt and the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]].&lt;ref name="EUO21153"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lucia Kubosova |url=http://euobserver.com/?aid=21153 |title=Eurosceptics kick out Italian Lega Nord party, EUO, 16 March 2006 |publisher=Euobserver.com |date=16 March 2006 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; MEPs from the League of Polish Families also left the group, although not all and not all at once.&lt;ref name="EUO21153"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EUO23095"&gt;{{cite web|author=Helena Spongenberg |url=http://euobserver.com/9/23095/?rk=1 |title=Parliament nations group gets a power boost, EUO, 13 December 2006 |publisher=Euobserver.com |date=13 December 2006 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 24 June 2008, IND/DEM had 22 MEPs.&lt;ref name="EPINDDEM"/&gt;

The great majority of these seats (thirteen) were from the [[UK Independence Party]], with others being two from the [[ChristianUnion – Reformed Political Party]] of the Netherlands, two from the [[Popular Orthodox Rally]] of Greece, and one from [[Libertas France]]. But that didn't meet the threshold laid down in the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure.&lt;ref name="Rule3020090701"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20090714+RULE-030+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;language=EN&amp;navigationBar=YES|title=Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament - July 2009 - Rule 30 - Formation of political groups|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rule2920090406"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+RULES-EP+20090309+RULE-029+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;navigationBar=YES|title=Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament - March 2009 - Rule 29 - Formation of political groups|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; So when the Seventh European Parliament started on 14 July 2009, IND/DEM would not qualify as a group.

On 30 June 2009, it was reported the remnants of IND/DEM were to unite with the remnants of another collapsing group, [[Union for a Europe of Nations]] (UEN), to create a new group whose official name was not yet determined.&lt;ref name="EUO28394"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/843/28394|title=Ukip, Lega Nord form hard-right bloc in EU Parliament|publisher=|accessdate=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

===Subgroups===
IND/DEM was a coalition of MEPs from two distinct wings of Euroscepticism: a reformist subgroup (sometimes referred to as ''Eurorealists'') made up of those MEPs who believed that the EU was essentially desirable if reformed and who supported greater transparency and control over the EU bureaucracy, and a secessionist subgroup consisting of those MEPs (notably UKIP&lt;ref name="PERSSON2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epubl.ltu.se/1402-1552/2007/079/LTU-DUPP-07079-SE.pdf|title=Simple search|website=epubl.ltu.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;) who believed that the EU was inherently wrong even if reformed and who advocated withdrawal from the EU.&lt;ref name="CWU01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CRSRS21998"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://italy.usembassy.gov/pdf/other/RS21998.pdf |title=Congressional Research Service Report RS21998, on the European Parliament, by Kristin Archick, Specialist in European Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division, Updated January 23, 2008 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527111942/http://italy.usembassy.gov/pdf/other/RS21998.pdf |archivedate=27 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organisation===
IND/DEM had a joint political leadership. The group's co-chairs were [[Nigel Farage]]&lt;ref name="ID8"&gt;[http://indemgroup.eu/8/ Independence/Democracy Group in the European Parliament: Our Members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704154645/http://indemgroup.eu/8/ |date=4 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (UKIP) and [[Hanne Dahl]],&lt;ref name="ID8"/&gt; the latter succeeding [[Kathy Sinnott]],&lt;ref name="ID8"/&gt; who in turn succeeded long-time MEP [[Jens-Peter Bonde]] (June Movement) on his retirement in May 2008. Farage represented the secessionist subgroup, and Sinnott the reformist subgroup. The leadership was loose, enabling the two subgroups to unite around the broad principles of democracy and transparency&lt;ref name="PERSSON2007"/&gt; which were embodied in its statute and to which IND/DEM MEPs were expected to adhere.&lt;ref name="ID16"&gt;[http://indemgroup.eu/16/ Independence/Democracy Group in the European Parliament: Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702151139/http://indemgroup.eu/16/ |date=2 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The day-to-day running of the group was performed by its secretariat, and its secretaries-general were Claudine Vangrunderbeeck and Herman Verheirstraeten.&lt;ref name="ID7"&gt;[http://indemgroup.eu/7/ Independence/Democracy Group in the European Parliament: Staff] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705053829/http://indemgroup.eu/7/ |date=5 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A December 2007 European Parliament document&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/welcome_brochures/faces/ep_faces_2007_09_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; considered the groups. Page 9 of that document had a table. That table gave the number of MEPs for each group and member state at December 2007. That table's data for IND/DEM is depicted as percentages in the diagram on the right.

Such support for IND/DEM as was expressed came from Northern European states, with especial reference to the member states of the North-West. Its strongholds were Sweden and Denmark, who sent "June list" MEPs from [[June List]] and [[June Movement]] to the Parliament, and the United Kingdom, with 13% of its MEPs at December 2007 coming from UKIP and sitting with IND/DEM. As of December 2007 no member state had more than 13% of its MEPs sitting with IND/DEM and eighteen member states (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain) had none.

==Academic analysis==
{{main|Academic studies of the political groups of the European Parliament}}

Along with the other political groups, IND/DEM was analysed by academics on its positions regarding various issues. Those positions are summarised in [[Academic studies of the political groups of the European Parliament|this article]]. That article characterised IND/DEM as right-wing and/or Eurosceptics who cooperated most closely with the [[Non-Inscrits]], were unanimously opposed to hypothetical EU taxes, over 90% male, and against Turkish accession to the European Union.

The '''Industrial Workers of the World''' ('''IWW'''), members of which are commonly termed "'''Wobblies'''", is an international labor union that was founded in 1905 in [[Chicago]], Illinois, in the United States. The union combines [[general union]]ism with [[industrial unionism]], as it is a general union whose members are further organized within the [[economic sector|industry]] of their employment. The [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics|philosophy and tactics of the IWW]] are described as "revolutionary industrial unionism", with ties to both [[History of the socialist movement in the United States|socialist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Caro-Morente |first=Jaime |title=The political culture of the IWW in its first 20 years |magazine=Industrial Worker |edition=Summer 2017 |number=1780/3 |volume=114 |url=https://libcom.org/library/industrial-worker-summer-2017 |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anarchism in the United States#American anarchism and the labor movement|anarchist]] labor movements.

In the 1910s and early 1920s, the IWW achieved many of their short-term goals, particularly in the American West, and cut across traditional guild and union lines to organize workers in a variety of trades and industries.  At their peak in August 1917, IWW membership was more than 150,000, with active wings in the U.S., Canada and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Eric Thomas |last=Chester |title=The Wobblies in Their Heyday: The Rise and Destruction of the Industrial Workers of the World during the World War I Era |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KBKJBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=9781440833021 |page=xii |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extremely high rate of IWW membership [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]] during this era (estimated at 133% per decade) makes it difficult for historians to state membership totals with any certainty, as workers tended to join the IWW in large numbers for relatively short periods (e.g., during [[labor strike]]s and periods of generalized economic distress).&lt;ref name="Brissenden"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://archive.org/details/iwwstudyofameri00bris/page/n5 |first=Paul Frederick |last=Brissenden, Ph.D. |title=The I.W.W.: A Study of American Syndicalism |volume=83 |number=193 |edition=2 |publisher=Columbia University |year=1920 |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to several factors, membership declined dramatically in the late 1910s and 1920s. There were conflicts with other labor groups, particularly the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL), which regarded the IWW as too radical, while the IWW regarded the AFL as too conservative and dividing workers by craft.&lt;ref name="Saros2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Saros |first=Daniel E. |year=2009 |title=Labor, Industry, and Regulation During the Progressive Era | publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781135842338 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BAuRAgAAQBAJ |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership also declined due to government crackdowns on radical, [[anarchism|anarchist]] and socialist groups during the [[First Red Scare]] after World War I. In Canada the IWW was outlawed by the federal government.

Probably the most decisive factor in the decline in IWW membership and influence, however, was a [[Industrial Workers of the World organizational evolution#1924 split|1924 schism]] in the organization, from which the IWW never fully recovered.&lt;ref name="Saros2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Renshaw1967"&gt;{{cite book |last=Renshaw |first=Patrick |title=The Wobblies: The Story of the IWW and Syndicalism in the United States |year=1967 |publisher=Ivan R.

==History 1905–1950==
{{main|Industrial Workers of the World organizational evolution}}

===Founding===
[[File:IWW-headquarters-1917.jpg|thumb|[[Big Bill Haywood]] and office workers in the IWW General Office, Chicago, summer 1917.]]

The [[Continental Congress of the working class|IWW was founded]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]] in the United States in June 1905. A convention was held of 200 [[socialism|socialists]], [[anarchism|anarchists]], [[Marxism|Marxists]] (primarily members of the [[Socialist Party of America]] and [[Socialist Labor Party]]) radical trade unionists from all over the United States (mainly the [[Western Federation of Miners]]) who strongly opposed the policies of the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL). The IWW opposed the American Federation of Labor's acceptance of capitalism and its refusal to include unskilled workers in craft unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Industrial-Workers-of-the-World |title=Industrial Workers of the World - Labour Organization |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention had taken place on June 24, 1905, and was referred to as the "Industrial Congress" or the "Industrial Union Convention". It would later be known as the First Annual Convention of the IWW.&lt;ref name="Brissenden" /&gt;{{rp|67}} It later became considered one of the most important events in the history of [[industrial unionism]].&lt;ref name="Brissenden" /&gt;{{rp|67}}

The IWW's founders included [[Bill Haywood|William D. ("Big Bill") Haywood]], [[James Connolly]], [[Daniel De Leon]], [[Eugene V. Debs]], [[Thomas Hagerty]], [[Lucy Parsons]], [[Mary Harris "Mother" Jones]], [[Frank Bohn (socialist)|Frank Bohn]], [[William Trautmann]], [[Vincent Saint John]], [[Ralph Chaplin]], and many others.

Regardless of gender roles, men and women came together to create IWW. Post-industrial theorists concentrated on hierarchies of class, rather than those of gender and, like their predecessors, the new theorists of technology also fail to consider whether this technological revolution might have a different impact on women and men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wajcman |first=Judy |year=2013 |title=TechnoFeminism |chapter=Male Designs on Technology |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9780745638058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IWW aimed to promote worker solidarity in the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the employing class; its [[Labor slogans|motto]] was "[[an injury to one is an injury to all]]", which improved upon the [[Knights of Labor]]'s creed, "an injury to one is the concern of all" which was at its most popular in the 1880s.  In particular, the IWW was organized because of the belief among many unionists, socialists, anarchists, Marxists, and radicals that the AFL not only had failed to effectively organize the U.S. [[working class]],  but it was causing separation rather than unity within groups of workers by organizing according to narrow craft principles. The Wobblies believed that all workers should organize as a class, a philosophy which is still reflected in the Preamble to the current IWW Constitution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life.

Between these two classes a [[class struggle|struggle]] must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth.

We find that the centering of the management of industries into fewer and fewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with the ever growing power of the employing class. The trade unions foster a state of affairs which allows one set of workers to be pitted against another set of workers in the same industry, thereby helping defeat one another in wage wars. Moreover, the trade unions aid the employing class to mislead the workers into the belief that the working class have interests in common with their employers.

These conditions can be changed and the interest of the [[working class]] upheld only by an organization formed in such a way that all its members in any one industry, or in all industries if necessary, cease work whenever a strike or lockout is on in any department thereof, thus making an injury to one an injury to all.

Instead of the conservative motto, "A fair day's wage for a fair day's work," we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword, "Abolition of the wage system."

It is the historic mission of the working class to do away with capitalism. The army of production must be organized, not only for everyday struggle with capitalists, but also to carry on production when capitalism shall have been overthrown. By organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the [[new society within the shell of the old]].&lt;ref name="preamble" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:IWW charter.jpg|thumb|alt=Framed, formal document featuring various IWW themes, cursive body text, hand-filled forms and a stamped seal.|The first IWW charter in Canada, Vancouver Industrial Mixed Union no.322, May 5, 1906.]]
The Wobblies, as they were informally known, differed from other union movements of the time by promotion of [[industrial unionism]], as opposed to the [[craft unionism]] of the [[American Federation of Labor]]. The IWW emphasized [[wikt:rank and file|rank-and-file]] organization, as opposed to empowering leaders who would bargain with employers on behalf of workers. The early IWW chapters' consistently refused to sign contracts, which they believed would restrict workers' abilities to aid each other when called upon. Though never developed in any detail, Wobblies envisioned the [[general strike]] as the means by which the wage system would be overthrown and a new economic system ushered in, one which emphasized people over profit, cooperation over competition.

One of the IWW's most important contributions to the labor movement and broader push towards social justice was that, when founded, it was the only American union to welcome all workers, including women, immigrants, African Americans and Asians, into the same organization. Many of its early members were immigrants, and some, such as [[Carlo Tresca]], [[Joe Haaglund Hill|Joe Hill]] and [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]], rose to prominence in the leadership. [[Finnish people|Finns]] formed a sizeable portion of the immigrant IWW membership. "Conceivably, the number of Finns belonging to the I.W.W. was somewhere between five and ten thousand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.genealogia.fi/emi/art/article257e.htm | title=Finnish-American Workmen's Associations |first=Auvo |last=Kostiainen | publisher=Genealogia.fi |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Finnish language|Finnish-language]] newspaper of the IWW, ''[[Industrialisti]]'', published in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]], [[Minnesota]], a center of the mining industry, was the union's only daily paper. At its peak, it ran 10,000 copies per issue. Another Finnish-language Wobbly publication was the monthly ''[[Tie Vapauteen]]'' ("Road to Freedom"). Also of note was the Finnish IWW educational institute, the [[Work People's College]] in Duluth, and the [[Finnish Labour Temple]] in [[Port Arthur, Ontario]], Canada, which served as the IWW Canadian administration for several years. One example of the union's commitment to equality was Local 8, a longshoremen's branch in Philadelphia, one of the largest ports in the nation in the WWI era. Led by [[Ben Fletcher]], an African American, Local 8 had more than 5,000 members, the majority of whom were African American, along with more than a thousand immigrants (primarily Lithuanians and Poles), Irish Americans, and numerous white ethnics.

The IWW was condemned by politicians and the press, who saw them as a threat to the market systems as well as an effort to monopolize labor at a time when efforts to monopolize industries were being fought as anti-market. Factory owners would employ means both non-violent (sending in [[Salvation Army]] bands to drown out speakers) and violent to disrupt their meetings. Members were often arrested and sometimes killed for making public speeches, but this persecution only inspired activism.{{Citation needed|reason=Militancy hasn't been established, much less 'further militancy'. The IWW has been notable for using non-violent tactics in opposition to factory owners over time.|date=February 2013}}

===Political action or direct action?===
{{Main|Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics}}
In 1908 a group led by [[Daniel DeLeon]] argued that [[politics|political action]] through DeLeon's [[Socialist Labor Party]] (SLP) was the best way to attain the IWW's goals. The other faction, led by Vincent Saint John, William Trautmann, and Big Bill Haywood, believed that [[direct action]] in the form of [[strike action|strikes]], [[propaganda]], and [[boycott]]s was more likely to accomplish sustainable gains for working people; they were opposed to arbitration and to political affiliation. Haywood's faction prevailed, and De Leon and his supporters left the organization, forming their own version of the IWW. The SLP's "[[Wobbly lingo#Yellow IWW|Yellow IWW]]" eventually took the name [[Workers' International Industrial Union]], which was disbanded in 1924.

The IWW first attracted attention in [[Goldfield, Nevada|Goldfield]], [[Nevada]] in 1906 and during the [[Pressed Steel Car Strike of 1909]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neiu.edu/~reseller/ehpg9repst.htm |title=Short history of Pressed Steel Car Company |publisher=NEIU.edu |access-date=14 October 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828072626/http://www.neiu.edu/~reseller/ehpg9repst.htm |archive-date=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania]]. Further fame was gained later that year, when they took their stand on free speech. The town of [[Spokane, Washington]] had outlawed street meetings, and arrested [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Arksey |first=Laura |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/7462 |title=Spokane — Thumbnail History |publisher=HistoryLink.org |date=4 September 2005 |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Wobbly organizer, for breaking this ordinance. The response was simple but effective: when a fellow member was arrested for speaking, large numbers of people descended on the location and invited the authorities to arrest all of them, until it became too expensive for the town. In Spokane, over 500 people went to jail and four people died. The tactic of [[Free speech fights|fighting for free speech]] to popularize the cause and preserve the right to organize openly was used effectively in [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], [[Aberdeen, Washington|Aberdeen]], and other locations. In [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], although there was no particular organizing campaign at stake, vigilantes supported by local officials and powerful businessmen [[San Diego free speech fight|mounted a particularly brutal]] counter-offensive.

The IWW was involved in over 150 strikes, including the [[Lawrence textile strike]] (1912), the [[Paterson silk strike of 1913|Paterson silk strike]] (1913) and [[the Mesabi range]] (1916). They were also involved in what came to be known as the [[Wheatland Hop Riot]] on August 3, 1913.

In its first decades, the IWW created more than 900 unions located in more than 350 cities and towns in 38 states and territories of the United States and 5 Canadian provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://depts.washington.edu/iww/map_locals.shtml |title=IWW Local Unions 1906-1917 (maps) |website=depts.washington.edu |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the country, there were 90 newspapers and periodicals affiliated with the IWW, published in 19 different languages.

===IWW versus AFL Carpenters, Goldfield, Nevada, 1907===
The IWW assumed a prominent role in 1906 and 1907, in the gold-mining boom town of [[Goldfield, Nevada]]. At that time, the Western Federation of Miners was still an affiliate of the IWW (the WFM withdrew from the IWW in the summer of 1907). In 1906, the IWW became so powerful in Goldfield that it could dictate wages and working conditions. 

Resisting IWW domination was the AFL-affiliated Carpenters Union. In March 1907, the IWW demanded that the mines deny employment to AFL Carpenters, which led mine owners to challenge the IWW. The mine owners banded together and pledged not to employ any IWW members. The mine and business owners of Goldfield staged a lockout, vowing to remain shut until they had broken the power of the IWW. The lockout prompted a split within the Goldfield workforce, between conservative and radical union members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Russell R. |last=Elliott |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HkeA6xD97QcC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=afl+iww+goldfield&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UN4jukpKx6&amp;sig=tbOTaIZRFSmZ_LPTbZ7ZoAje6Qk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCWoVChMIg9HDjeKHyQIVAfxjCh3jlwEP#v=onepage&amp;q=afl%20iww%20goldfield&amp;f=false |title=Nevada's Twentieth-Century Mining Boom: Tonopah, Goldfield, Ely |publisher=University of Nevada Press |year=1966 |isbn=9780874171334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mine owners persuaded the Nevada governor to ask for federal troops. Under the protection of federal troops, the mine owners reopened the mines with non-union labor, breaking the influence of the IWW in Goldfield.

===The Haywood trial and the exit of the Western Federation of Miners===
Leaders of the Western Federation of Miners such as Bill Haywood and Vincent St. John were instrumental in forming the IWW, and the WFM affiliated with the new union organization shortly after the IWW was formed. The WFM became the IWW's "mining section." However, many in the rank and file of the WFM were uncomfortable with the open radicalism of the IWW, and wanted the WFM to maintain its independence. Schisms between the WFM and IWW had emerged at the annual IWW convention in 1906, when a majority of WFM delegates walked out.&lt;ref name="Brissenden" /&gt;

When WFM executives Bill Haywood, [[George Pettibone]], and [[Charles Moyer]] were accused of complicity in the murder of former Idaho governor [[Frank Steunenberg]], the IWW used the case to raise funds and support, and paid for the legal defense. However, even the not guilty verdicts worked against the IWW, because the IWW was deprived of martyrs, and at the same time, a large portion of the public remained convinced of the guilt of the accused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=American Bar Association Journal |volume=54 |number=5 |date=May 1968 |jstor=25724408 |title=This fabric under which we have lived (editorial) |page=474 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25724408 |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trials caused a bitter split between Haywood and Moyer. The Haywood trial also provoked a reaction within the WFM against violence and radicalism. In the summer of 1907, the WFM withdrew from the IWW, Vincent St. John left the WFM to spend his time organizing the IWW.

Bill Haywood for a time remained a member of both organizations. His murder trial had made Haywood a celebrity, and he was in demand as a speaker for the WFM. However, his increasingly radical speeches became more at odds with the WFM, and in April 1908, the WFM announced that the union had ended Haywood's role as a union representative. Haywood left the WFM, and devoted all his time to organizing for the IWW.&lt;ref name="Brissenden" /&gt;{{rp|216-217}}

Historian Vernon H. Jensen has asserted that the IWW had a "rule or ruin" policy, under which it attempted to wreck local unions which it could not control.  From 1908 to 1921, Jensen and others have written, the IWW attempted to win power in WFM locals which had once formed the federation's backbone. When it could not do so, IWW agitators undermined WFM locals, which caused the national union to shed nearly half its membership.&lt;ref name="Fink"&gt;{{cite book |title=Biographical Dictionary of American Labor |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=9780313228650 |year=1984 |first=Gary M. |last=Fink}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dubofsky"&gt;{{cite book |title=We Shall Be All: A History of the Industrial Workers of the World |first=Melvin |last=Dubofsky |editor-first=Joseph A. |editor-last=McCartin |year=2000 |isbn=9780252069055 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DmAer6Nz75kC |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Butte Unions Back Rebels |work=Los Angeles Times |date=23 June 1914 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/search/#lnd=1&amp;query=Butte+Unions+Back+Rebels&amp;ymd=1914-06-23&amp;p_place=CA |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Disrupted by I.W.W. |work=Los Angeles Times |date=22 June 1914 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/search/#lnd=1&amp;query=disrupted+by+i.w.w&amp;ymd=1914-06-22&amp;t=4312 |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Paid Moyer's Gunmen |work=Los Angeles Times |date=21 February 1915 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/search/#lnd=1&amp;query=Paid+Moyer%27s&amp;ymd=1915-02-21&amp;p_place=CA |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mine Federation in West Doomed by Faction's War |work=Chicago Daily Tribune |date=27 June 1914 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/search/#lnd=1&amp;query=Mine+Federation+Doomed&amp;ymd=1914-06-27&amp;t=4351&amp;p_place=IL |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Armed Guards Posted in Stores of Butte |work=Los Angeles Times |date=28 June 1914 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/search/#lnd=1&amp;query=Armed+Guards+Posted+in+Stores+of+Butte&amp;ymd=1914-06-28&amp;p_place=CA |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IWW versus the Western Federation of Miners===
The Western Federation of Miners left the IWW in 1907, but the IWW wanted the WFM back. The WFM had made up about a third of the IWW membership, and the western miners were tough union men, and good allies in a labor dispute. In 1908, Vincent St. John tried to organize a stealth takeover of the WFM. He wrote to WFM organizer Albert Ryan, encouraging him to find reliable IWW sympathizers at each WFM local, and have them appointed delegates to the annual convention by pretending to share whatever opinions of that local needed to become a delegate. Once at the convention, they could vote in a pro-IWW slate. St. Vincent promised: “… once we can control the officers of the WFM for the IWW, the big bulk of the membership will go with them.” But the takeover did not succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Official Proceedings of the Twentieth Annual Convention, Western Federation of Miners, July 1912, p.283-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, Butte, Montana erupted into [[Butte, Montana labor riots of 1914|a series of riots]] as miners dissatisfied with the [[Western Federation of Miners]] local at Butte formed a new union, and demanded that all miners join the new union, or be subject to beatings or worse. Although the new rival union had no affiliation with the IWW, it was widely seen as IWW-inspired. The leadership of the new union contained many who were members of the IWW, or agreed with the IWW's methods and objectives. However, the new union failed to supplant the WFM, and the ongoing fight between the two factions had the result that the copper mines of Butte, which had long been a union stronghold for the WFM, became open shops, and the mine owners recognized no union from 1914 until 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c7FXL6R5MM0C |first=Nancy |last=Capace |title=Encyclopedia of Montana |isbn=9780403096046 |page=156 |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IWW versus United Mine Workers, Scranton, Pennsylvania, 1916===
The IWW clashed with the [[United Mine Workers]] union in April 1916, when the IWW picketed the anthracite mines around Scranton, Pennsylvania, intending, by persuasion or force, to keep UMWA members from going to work. The IWW considered the UMWA too reactionary, because the United Mine Workers negotiated contracts with the mine owners for fixed time periods; the IWW considered that contracts hindered their revolutionary goals. In what a contemporary writer pointed out was a complete reversal of their usual policy, UMWA officials called for police to protect United Mine Workers members who wished to cross the picket lines. The Pennsylvania State Police arrived in force, prevented picket line violence, and allowed the UMWA members to peacefully pass through the IWW picket lines.&lt;ref name="Brissenden" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Justice to All: the Story of the Pennsylvania State Police |first=Katherine |last=Mayo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XIBDAAAAIAAJ |year=1917 |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1915 and 1917, the IWW's [[Agricultural Workers Organization]] (AWO) organized more than a hundred thousand migratory farm workers throughout the Midwest and western United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Henry E. |last=McGuckin |title=Memoirs of a Wobbly |publisher=Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company |year=1987 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; often signing up and organizing members in the field, in rail yards and in hobo jungles. During this time, the IWW member became synonymous with the hobo riding the rails; migratory farmworkers could scarcely afford any other means of transportation to get to the next jobsite. Railroad boxcars, called "side door coaches" by the hobos, were frequently plastered with [[silent agitators]] from the IWW.

Building on the success of the AWO, the IWW's [[Lumber Workers Industrial Union]] (LWIU) used similar tactics to organize [[lumberjack]]s and other timber workers, both in the deep South and the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada, between 1917 and 1924. The IWW lumber strike of 1917 led to the [[eight-hour day]] and vastly improved working conditions in the Pacific Northwest. Even though mid-century historians would give credit to the US Government and "forward thinking lumber magnates" for agreeing to such reforms, an IWW strike forced these concessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=One Big Union | year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1913 through the mid-1930s, the IWW's Marine Transport Workers Industrial Union (MTWIU), proved a force to be reckoned with and competed with AFL unions for ascendance in the industry. Given the union's commitment to international solidarity, its efforts and success in the field come as no surprise. Local 8 of the Marine Transport Workers was led by Ben Fletcher, who organized predominantly African-American longshoremen on the Philadelphia and Baltimore waterfronts, but other leaders included the Swiss immigrant Walter Nef, Jack Walsh, E.F. Doree, and the Spanish sailor Manuel Rey. The IWW also had a presence among waterfront workers in [[Boston]], [[New York City]], [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[Eureka, California|Eureka]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]] as well as in ports in the Caribbean, Mexico, South America, Australia, New Zealand, Germany and other nations. IWW members played a role in the 1934 [[1934 West Coast Longshore Strike|San Francisco general strike]] and the other organizing efforts by rank-and-filers within the [[International Longshoremen's Association]] up and down the West Coast.

Wobblies also played a role in the sit-down strikes and other organizing efforts by the [[United Auto Workers]] in the 1930s, particularly in Detroit, though they never established a strong union presence there.

Where the IWW did win strikes, such as in Lawrence, they often found it hard to hold onto their gains. The IWW of 1912 disdained [[collective bargaining agreement]]s and preached instead the need for constant struggle against the boss on the shop floor. It proved difficult, however, to maintain that sort of revolutionary enthusiasm against employers. In Lawrence, the IWW lost nearly all of its membership in the years after the strike, as the employers wore down their employees' resistance and eliminated many of the strongest union supporters. In 1938, the IWW voted to allow contracts with employers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The I.W.W.: Its First Seventy Years, 1905–1975 |first1=Fred W. |last1=Thompson |first2=Patrick |last2=Murfin |year=1976 |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; so long as they would not undermine any strike.

The IWW's efforts were met with "unparalleled" resistance from Federal, state and local governments in America;&lt;ref name="Saros2009"/&gt;  from company management and [[labor spies]], and from groups of citizens functioning as vigilantes.

Many IWW members opposed United States participation in [[World War I]]. The organization passed a resolution against the war at its convention in November 1916.&lt;ref name=Carlson&gt;{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Peter |title=Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood |year=1984 |isbn=0393302083 |publisher=[[W. W. Norton and Company]] |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=AsedGwAACAAJ |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|241}} This echoed the view, expressed at the IWW's founding convention, that war represents struggles among capitalists in which the rich become richer, and the working poor all too often die at the hands of other workers.

An IWW newspaper, the ''[[Industrial Worker]]'', wrote just before the U.S. declaration of war: "Capitalists of America, we will fight against you, not for you! There is not a power in the world that can make the working class fight if they refuse." Yet when a declaration of war was passed by the U.S. Congress in April 1917, the IWW's general secretary-treasurer Bill Haywood became determined that the organization should adopt a low profile in order to avoid perceived threats to its existence. The printing of anti-war stickers was discontinued, stockpiles of existing anti-war documents were put into storage, and anti-war propagandizing ceased as official union policy. After much debate on the General Executive Board, with Haywood advocating a low profile and GEB member [[Frank Little (U.S. Trade Unionist)|Frank Little]] championing continued agitation, Ralph Chaplin brokered a compromise agreement. A statement was issued that denounced the war, but IWW members were advised to channel their opposition through the legal mechanisms of conscription. They were advised to register for the draft, marking their claims for exemption "IWW, opposed to war."&lt;ref name=Carlson /&gt;{{rp|242{{ndash}}244}}

In spite of the IWW moderating its vocal opposition, the IWW's antiwar stance made it highly unpopular. Frank Little, the IWW's most outspoken war opponent, was lynched in [[Butte, Montana]] in August 1917, just four months after war had been declared.

During World War I the U.S. government moved strongly against the IWW. On September 5, 1917, U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] agents made simultaneous raids on dozens of IWW meeting halls across the country.&lt;ref name="Dubofsky" /&gt;{{rp|406}} Minutes books, correspondence, mailing lists, and publications were seized, with the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] removing five tons of material from the IWW's General Office in Chicago alone.&lt;ref name="Dubofsky" /&gt;{{rp|406}} This seized material was scoured for possible violations of the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and other laws, with a view to future prosecution of the organization's leaders, organizers, and key activists.

Based in large measure on the documents seized September 5, one hundred and sixty-six IWW leaders were indicted by a Federal Grand Jury in Chicago for conspiring to hinder the draft, encourage desertion, and intimidate others in connection with labor disputes, under the new Espionage Act.&lt;ref name="Dubofsky" /&gt;{{rp|407}} One hundred and one went on trial en masse before Judge [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] in 1918. Their lawyer was [[George Vanderveer]] of Seattle.&lt;ref name=Schlossberg&gt;

Sentenced to prison by Judge Landis and released on bail, Haywood fled to the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] where he remained until his death.

In 1917, during an incident known as the [[Tulsa Outrage]], a group of black-robed Knights of Liberty, a short-lived faction of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], tarred and feathered seventeen members of the IWW in Oklahoma. The IWW members had been turned over to the Knights of Liberty by local authorities after they were convicted of the crime of not owning war bonds. Five other men who testified in defense of the Wobblies were also fined by the court and subjected to the same torture and humiliations at the hands of the Knights of Liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thislandpress.com/04/18/2012/tate-brady-battle-greenwood/|last= Chapman|first= Lee Roy|title=The Nightmare of Dreamland|publisher=''This Land Press|date=September 1, 2011|accessdate= July 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wikisource|Why the IWW Is Not Patriotic to the United States}}

In 1919, an [[Armistice Day]] parade by the [[American Legion]] in [[Centralia, Washington]] turned into a fight between legionnaires and IWW members in which four legionnaires and a Centralia deputy sheriff were shot dead. Which side initiated the violence of the [[Centralia massacre (Washington)|Centralia massacre]] is disputed. A number of IWWs were arrested, one of whom, [[Wesley Everest]], was lynched by a mob that night.&lt;ref&gt;See:"Wesley Everest, IWW Martyr" Pacific Northwest Quarterly, October 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the IWW were prosecuted under various State and federal laws and the 1920 [[Palmer Raids]] singled out the foreign-born members of the organization.

===Organizational schism and afterwards===

IWW quickly recovered from the setbacks of 1919 and 1920, with membership peaking in 1923 (58,300 estimated by dues paid per capita, though membership was likely much higher as the union tolerated delinquent members).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Fred|title=They didn't suppress the Wobblies|url=https://libcom.org/history/they-didnt-suppress-wobblies-fred-thompson|website=libcom.org|publisher=Radical America (September–October 1967)|accessdate=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1924, membership began declining due to government repression and a contentious organizational schism, when the organization split between the "Westerners" and the "Easterners" over a number of issues, including the role of the General Administration (often oversimplified as a struggle between "centralists" and "decentralists"), Stalinist atrocities in the Soviet Union{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} and attempts by the Communist Party to dominate the organization.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} By 1930 membership was down to around 10,000.

At the beginning of the 1949 [[Smith Act trials]], FBI director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] was disappointed when prosecutors indicted fewer CPUSA members than he had hoped, and – recalling the arrests and convictions of over one hundred IWW leaders in 1917 – complained to the Justice Department, stating, "the IWW was crushed and never revived, similar action at this time would have been as effective against the Communist Party."

==Activity after World War II==

====Taft-Hartley Act====
{{See also|Metal and Machinery Workers Industrial Union#Decline}}
[[File:An-injury-to-one.png|frame|right|alt=IWW globe logo encircled by an IWW slogan.|[[An injury to one is an injury to all]].]]
After the passage of the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] in 1946 by Congress, which called for the removal of Communist union leadership, the IWW experienced a loss of membership as differences of opinion occurred over how to respond to the challenge. In 1949, US Attorney General [[Tom C. Clark]]&lt;ref name="Tyler1967"&gt;{{cite book | last=Tyler | first=Robert L. | title=Rebels of the woods: the I.W.W. in the Pacific Northwest | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GI6xAAAAIAAJ | accessdate=20 October 2011 | date=January 1967 | publisher=University of Oregon Books | page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; placed the IWW on the [[Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations]]&lt;ref name="LeeBekken2009"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Lee | first1=Frederic S. | last2=Bekken | first2=Jon | title=Radical economics and labor: essays inspired by the IWW Centennial | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_F54Pi4lFIMC&amp;pg=PA3 | accessdate=20 October 2011 | year=2009 | publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis US]] | isbn=978-0-415-77723-0 | page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the category of "organizations seeking to change the government by unconstitutional means" under [[Executive Order 9835]], which offered no means of appeal, and which excluded all IWW members from Federal employment and federally subsidized housing programs (this order was revoked by [[Executive Order 10450]] in 1953).

At this time, the Cleveland local of the [[Metal and Machinery Workers Industrial Union]] (MMWIU) was the strongest IWW branch in the United States. Leading figures such as [[Frank Cedervall]], who had helped build the branch up for over ten years, were concerned about the possibility of raiding from AFL-CIO unions if the IWW had its legal status as a union revoked. In 1950, Cedervall led the 1500-member MMWIU national organization to split from the IWW, as the [[Lumber Workers Industrial Union]] had almost thirty years earlier. Unfortunately for the MMWIU, this act would not save it. Despite its brief affiliation with the Congress of Industrial Organizations, it would face serious raiding from AFL and CIO and would be defunct by the late 1950s, less than ten years after separating from the IWW.&lt;ref name=ECH_IWW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=IWOTW |title=INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF THE WORLD (IWW) |website=Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |publisher=[[Case Western Reserve University]] |location=[[Cleveland]] |access-date=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of the MMWIU, at the time the IWW's largest industrial union, was almost a deathblow to the IWW. The union's membership fell to its lowest level in the 1950s during the [[Red Scare|Second Red Scare]], and by 1955, the union's fiftieth anniversary, it was near extinction, though it still appeared on government lists of Communist-led groups.&lt;ref name=chronology4671&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iww.org/about/chronology/6 |title=IWW Chronology (1946–1971) |website=IWW.org |publisher=Industrial Workers of the World |access-date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1960s rejuvenation====

The 1960s [[civil rights movement]], anti-war protests, and various university student movements brought new life to the IWW, albeit with many fewer new members than the great organizing drives of the early part of the 20th century.

The first signs of new life for the IWW in the 1960s would be organizing efforts among students in San Francisco and Berkeley, which were hotbeds of student radicalism at the time. This targeting of students would result in a Bay Area branch of the union with over a hundred members in 1964, almost as many as the union's total membership in 1961. Wobblies old and new would unite for one more "free speech fight": Berkeley's [[Free Speech Movement]]. Riding on this high, the decision in 1967 to allow college and university students to join the [[Education Workers Industrial Union]] (IU 620) as full members spurred campaigns in 1968 at the [[University of Waterloo]] in Ontario, the [[University of Wisconsin]] in Milwaukee, and the [[University of Michigan]] in Ann Arbor.&lt;ref name=nothingincommon&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Silvano |editor-first=John |title=Nothing in Common: An Oral History of IWW Strikes 1971–1992 |date=1999 |isbn=1-892779-22-6 |lccn=99-65777 |publisher=[[Cedar Publishing]] |location=[[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]] |url=http://www.iww.org/PDF/history/library/misc/NothinginCommon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} The IWW would send representatives to [[Students for a Democratic Society]] conventions in 1967, 1968, and 1969, and as the SDS collapsed into infighting, the IWW would gain members who were fleeing this discord. These changes would have a profound effect on the union, which by 1972 would have sixty-seven percent of members under the age of thirty, with a total of nearly five hundred members.&lt;ref name=nothingincommon /&gt;{{rp|14}}

The IWW's links to the 60s counterculture led to organizing campaigns at counterculture businesses, as well as a wave of over two dozen co-ops affiliating with the IWW under its [[Wobbly Shop]] model in the 1960s to 1980s. These businesses were primarily in printing, publishing, and food distribution; from underground newspapers and radical print shops to community co-op grocery stores. Some of the printing and publishing industry co-ops and job shops included [[Fredy Perlman|Black &amp; Red]] (Detroit), Glad Day Press (New York),&lt;ref name=nothingincommon /&gt;{{rp|17}} RPM Press (Michigan),&lt;ref name=nothingincommon /&gt;{{rp|17}} New Media Graphics (Ohio),&lt;ref name=nothingincommon /&gt;{{rp|17}} Babylon Print (Wisconsin),&lt;ref name=nothingincommon /&gt;{{rp|17}} Hill Press (Illinois),&lt;ref name=nothingincommon /&gt;{{rp|17}} Lakeside ([[Madison, Wisconsin]]), Harbinger ([[Columbia, South Carolina]]), Eastown Printing in Grand Rapids, Michigan (where the IWW negotiated a contract in 1978),&lt;ref name=nothingincommon /&gt;{{rp|17}} and La Presse Populaire (Montréal). This close affiliation with radical publishers and printing houses sometimes led to legal difficulties for the union, such as when La Presse Populaire was shut down in 1970 by provincial police for publishing pro-[[FLQ]] materials, which were banned at the time under an official censorship law. Also in 1970, the [[San Diego, California]] "street journal" ''El Barrio'' became an official IWW shop. In 1971 its office was attacked by a fascist organization calling itself the [[Minutemen (anti-Communist organization)|Minutemen]], and IWW member Ricardo Gonzalves was indicted for criminal syndicalism along with two members of the [[Brown Berets]].&lt;ref name=chronology4671 /&gt;

These ties to anti-authoritarian and radical artistic and literary currents would link the IWW even more heavily to the 60s counterculture, exemplified by the publication in Chicago in the 1960s of ''Rebel Worker'' by the [[surrealism|surrealists]] [[Franklin Rosemont|Franklin]] and [[Penelope Rosemont]]. One edition was published in London with [[Charles Radcliffe]], who went on to become involved with the [[Situationist International]]. By the 1980s, the ''Rebel Worker'' was being published as an official organ again, from the IWW's headquarters in Chicago, and the New York area was publishing a newsletter as well.

====Return to workplace campaigns====

Invigorated by the arrival of enthusiastic new members, the IWW began a wave of organizing drives. These largely took a regional form and they, as well as the union's overall membership, concentrated in Portland, Chicago, Ann Arbor, and throughout the state of California, which when combined accounted for over half of union drives from 1970 to 1979. In Portland, Oregon, the IWW led campaigns at Winter Products (a brass plating plant) in 1972, at a local [[Winchell's Donuts]] (where a strike was waged and lost), at the Albina Day Care (where key union demands were won, including the firing of the director of the day care), of healthcare workers at [[West Side School]] and the [[Portland Medical Center]], and of agricultural workers in 1974. The latter effort led to the founding of an IWW union hall in Burnside, Oregon to compete with extortionate hiring halls and day labor agencies. Organizing efforts led to a growth in membership, but repeated loss of strikes and organizing campaigns would anticipate the decline of the Portland branch after the mid-1970s, a stagnancy period which would last until the 1990s.&lt;ref name=nothingincommon /&gt;{{rp|15}}

In California, union activities were based in [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], where in 1977 the IWW engaged in one of its most ambitious campaigns of the 1970s: an attempt in 1977 to organize 3,000 workers hired under the [[Comprehensive Employment and Training Act]] (CETA) in [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz County]]. The campaign led to pay raises, the implementation of a grievance procedure, and medical and dental coverage, but the union failed to maintain its foothold, and in 1982 the CETA program would be replaced by the [[Job Training Partnership Act of 1982|Job Training Partnership Act]].&lt;ref name=nothingincommon /&gt;{{rp|15{{ndash}}16}} The IWW would win some lasting victories in Santa Cruz, however, with successful campaigns at the Janus Alcohol Recovery Center, the Santa Cruz Law Center, Project Hope, and the Santa Cruz Community Switchboard.&lt;ref name=nothingincommon /&gt;{{rp|16}}

Above the table is a large banner with the text, "We never forget!" along with the IWW name and globe logo. A variety of United Auto Workers logos are visible on the wall in the background.|Memorial service]]

Elsewhere in California, the IWW was active in [[Long Beach]] in 1972, the where it organized workers at [[International Wood Products]] and [[Park International Corporation]] (a manufacturer of plastic swimming pool filters) and went on strike after the firing of one worker for union-related activities.&lt;ref name="Park Int'l poster"&gt;{{Citation |title=Strike Support |date=1972 |publisher=Portland General Membership Branch, IWW}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in San Francisco, the IWW ran campaigns for radio station and food service workers.&lt;ref name=nothingincommon /&gt;{{rp|15{{ndash}}16}}

In Chicago, the IWW was an early opponent of so-called [[urban renewal]] programs (now more often termed as [[gentrification]]), and supported the creation of the "Chicago People's Park" in 1969. The Chicago branch also ran citywide campaigns for healthcare, food service, entertainment, construction, and metal workers, and its success with the latter led to an attempt to revive the national [[Metal and Machinery Workers Industrial Union]], which twenty years earlier had been a major component of the union. Metalworker organizing would largely end in 1978 after a failed strike at Mid-American Metal in [[Virden, Illinois]]. The IWW also became one of the first unions to try to organize fast food workers, with an organizing campaign at a local [[McDonald's]] in 1973.&lt;ref name=nothingincommon /&gt;{{rp|16}}

The IWW also built on its existing presence in Ann Arbor, which had existed since student organizing began at the University of Michigan, to launch an organizing campaign at the University Cellar, a college bookstore. The union won [[National Labor Relations Board]] (NLRB) certification there in 1979 following a strike, and the store would become a strong job shop for the union until it was closed in 1986. The union launched a similar campaign at another local bookstore, Charing Cross Books, but was unable to maintain its foothold there despite reaching a settlement with management.&lt;ref name=nothingincommon /&gt;{{rp|17}}

In the late 1970s, the IWW came to regional prominence in entertainment industry organizing, with an Entertainment Workers Organizing Committee being founded in Chicago in 1976, followed by campaigns organizing musicians in Cleveland in 1977 and Ann Arbor in 1978. The Chicago committee published a model contract which was distributed to musicians in the hopes of raising industry standards, as well as maintaining an active phone line for booking information. IWW musicians such as [[Utah Phillips]], [[Faith Petric]], [[Bob Bovee]], and [[Jim Ringer]] also toured and promoted the union,&lt;ref name=nothingincommon /&gt;{{rp|17}} and in 1987 an anthology album, ''Rebel Voices'', was released.

Other IWW organizing campaigns of the 1970s included a [[ShopRite (United States)|ShopRite]] supermarket in Milwaukee, at Coronet Foods in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], chemical and fast food workers (including [[KFC]] and [[Roy Rogers]]) in [[State College, Pennsylvania]], and hospital workers in Boston, all in 1973;
shipyards in [[Houston, Texas]] and restaurant workers in Pittsburgh in 1974; unsuccessful campaigns at the Prospect Nursing Home in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and a [[Pizza Hut]] in [[Arkadelphia, Arkansas]] in 1975; and a construction workers organizing drive in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=nothingincommon /&gt;{{rp|18}}

====1990s====

In the 1990s, the IWW was involved in many labor struggles and [[free speech fights]], including [[Redwood Summer]], and the picketing of the Neptune Jade in the port of Oakland in late 1997.

In 1996, the IWW launched an organizing drive against [[Borders Books]] in Philadelphia. In March, the union lost an NLRB certification vote by a narrow margin but continued to organize. In June, IWW member Miriam Fried was fired on trumped-up charges and a national boycott of Borders was launched in response. IWW members picketed at Borders stores nationwide, including Ann Arbor; Washington, D.C.; San Francisco; Miami; Chicago; Palo Alto; Portland, OR; Portland, ME; Boston; Philadelphia; Albany; Richmond; St. Louis; Los Angeles; and other cities. This was followed up with a National Day of Action in 1997, where Borders stores were again picketed nationwide, and a second organizing campaign in London, England.&lt;ref name=chronology9697&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iww.org/about/chronology/11 |title=IWW Chronology (1996–1997) |website=IWW.org |publisher=Industrial Workers of the World |access-date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1996, the IWW began organizing at [[Wherehouse Music]] in [[El Cerrito, California]]. The campaign continued until 1997, when management fired two organizers and laid off over half the employees, as well as reducing the hours of known union members. This directly affected the NLRB certification vote which followed, where the IWW lost over 2:1.&lt;ref name=chronology9697 /&gt;

[[File:Remember 2.jpg|thumb|alt=A group of seven people stand near the entrance of a building.|Three IWW General Secretary-Treasurers: Mark Kaufman, Jeff Ditz, and Fred Chase, at a funeral for a friend.]]

In 1998, the IWW chartered a San Francisco branch of the [[Marine Transport Workers Industrial Union]] (MTWIU), which trained hundreds of waterfront workers in health and safety techniques and attempted to institutionalize these safety practices on the San Francisco waterfront.&lt;ref name=chronology9899&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iww.org/about/chronology/12 |title=IWW Chronology (1998–1999) |website=IWW.org |publisher=Industrial Workers of the World |access-date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the IWW chartered a local branch of the [[Education Workers Industrial Union]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], which started to organize workers at local colleges and universities.

Additionally, IWW organizing drives in the late 90s included a strike at the Lincoln Park Mini Mart in Seattle in 1996, Keystone Job Corps, the community organization [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now|ACORN]], various homeless and youth centers in [[Portland, Oregon]], sex industry workers, and recycling shops in [[Berkeley, California]]. IWW members were also active in the building trades, shipyards, high tech industries, hotels and restaurants, public interest organizations, railroads, bike messengers, and lumber yards.

The IWW stepped in several times to help the rank and file in mainstream unions, including saw mill workers in [[Fort Bragg, California|Fort Bragg]] in California in 1989, concession stand workers in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in the late 1990s, and shipyards along the [[Mississippi River]].

In the early 2000s, the IWW organized Stonemountain and Daughter Fabrics, a fabric shop in Berkeley, California. The shop continues to remain an IWW organized shop.

The city of Berkeley's recycling is picked up, sorted, processed and sent out all through two different IWW-organized enterprises.

In 2003, the IWW began organizing street people and other non-traditional occupations with the formation of the Ottawa Panhandlers Union. A year later, the Panhandlers Union led a strike by the homeless. Negotiations with the city resulted in the city government promising to fund a newspaper written and sold by the homeless.

Between 2003 and 2006, the IWW organized unions at food co-operatives in Seattle, Washington and [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania. The IWW represents administrative and maintenance workers under contract in Seattle, while the union in Pittsburgh lost 22–21 in an NLRB election, only to have the results invalidated in late 2006, based on management's behavior before the election.

In 2004, an IWW union was organized in a New York City [[Starbucks]]. In 2006, the IWW continued efforts at Starbucks by organizing several Chicago area shops.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Dawdy, [http://www.seattleweekly.com/2005-12-07/news/a-union-shop-on-every-block "A Union Shop on Every Block"], ''Seattle Weekly'', December 7, 2005.

In Chicago the IWW began an effort to organize [[bicycle messenger]]s with some success.

In September 2004, IWW-organized short haul truck drivers in [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], [[California]] walked off their jobs and went on a strike. Nearly all demands were met. Despite early victories in Stockton, the truck driver union ceased to exist in mid-2005.

In New York City, the IWW has been organizing immigrant foodstuffs workers since 2005. That summer, workers from Handyfat Trading joined the IWW, and were soon followed by workers from four more warehouses.&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Esch, [http://www.brooklynrail.org/2007/4/local/wobblies-organize-brooklyn-warehouses "Wobblies Organize Brooklyn Warehouses"], ''Brooklyn Rail'', April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Workers at these warehouses made gains such as receiving the [[minimum wage]] and being paid overtime.

In 2006, the IWW moved its headquarters to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], and in 2010, headquarters was moved back to Chicago, Illinois.

Also in 2006, the IWW Bay Area Branch organized the Landmark Shattuck Cinemas. The Union has been negotiating for a contract and hopes to gain one through workplace democracy and organizing directly and taking action when necessary.

In May 2007, the NYC warehouse workers came together with the [[Starbucks Workers Union]] to form The Food and Allied Workers Union IU 460/640. In the summer of 2007, the IWW organized workers at two new warehouses: Flaum Appetizing, a [[Kosher]] food distributor, and Wild Edibles, a seafood company. Over the course of 2007–08, workers at both shops were illegally terminated for their union activity. In 2008, the workers at Wild Edibles actively fought to get their jobs back and to secure overtime pay owed to them by the boss. In a workplace justice campaign called Focus on the Food Chain, carried out jointly with [[Brandworkers International]], the IWW workers won settlements against employers including Pur Pac, Flaum Appetizing and Wild Edibles.&lt;ref&gt;Krauthamer, Diane.

Besides IWW's traditional practice of organizing industrially, the Union has been open to new methods such as organizing geographically: for instance, seeking to organize retail workers in a certain business district, as in [[Philadelphia]].

The union has also participated in such worker-related issues as protesting involvement in the war in Iraq, opposing sweatshops and supporting a boycott of [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca Cola]] for that company's [[Criticism of Coca-Cola#Colombia|support of the suppression of workers rights]] in [[Colombia]].

On July 5, 2008, the [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], [[Starbucks Workers Union]] and [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT-AIT]] in [[Seville, Spain]], organized a global day of action against alleged Starbucks [[union busting]], in particular the firing of two union members in Grand Rapids and Seville.  According to the Grand Rapids Starbucks Workers Union website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Posted by Wobblybarista | url=http://grsbuxunion.blogspot.com/2008/07/list-of-cities-and-countries-that.html | title=List of cities and countries that participated in the July 5 actions | publisher=Grand Rapids Starbucks Workers Union (IWW) | date=2008-07-06 | accessdate=2009-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; pickets were held in several dozen cities in more than a dozen countries.

The Portland, Oregon General Membership Branch is one of the largest and most active branches of the IWW currently. The branch holds three contracts currently, two with Janus Youth Programs and one with Portland Women's Crisis Line.&lt;ref name=pdx&gt;{{cite web | title=PortlandIWW.org – About | url=http://portlandiww.org/about/ | accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some debate within the branch about whether or not union contracts such as this are desirable in the long run, with some members favoring solidarity unionism as opposed to contract unionism and some members believing there is room for both strategies for organizing.  The branch has successfully supported workers wrongfully fired from several different workplaces in the last two years.  Due to picketing by Wobblies, these workers have received significant compensation from their former employers.  Branch membership has been increasing, as has shop organizing.  As of 2005, the 100th anniversary of its founding, the IWW had around 5,000 members, compared to 13 million members in the AFL-CIO.&lt;ref name="MOB"&gt;Moberg, David, ''Culture: Power to the Pictures'', In These Times Magazine, 19 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Other IWW branches are located in Australia, Austria, Canada, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], Germany, Uganda and the United Kingdom.

====2011 Wisconsin General Strike====

In early 2011, [[Wisconsin]] Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] announced a budget bill which the IWW held would effectively outlaw unions for state or municipal workers. In response, there was an emergency meeting of the Midwestern IWW member organizations. The participants decided that organizing a [[general strike]] was an absolute priority. IWW members presented a proposal at a meeting of South-Central Federation of Labor (SCFL) which would endorse a general strike and create an ad-hoc Committee to instruct affiliated locals in preparations for the general strike. The IWW proposal passed nearly unanimously. The Madison branch made an international appeal translating various materials concerning the strike into Arabic, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. Additionally, an appeal was made to European unions (CNT – Spain, CGT – Spain and CGT – France) to send organizers to Madison who could present their experience of general strikes at union meetings and help organize the strike in other ways. The CNT (France) sent letters of solidarity to the IWW. This was considered the largest and most successful intervention in a working-class struggle that the IWW has undertaken since the 1930s.&lt;ref name=gstrike&gt;{{cite web | title=IWW General Strike 2011 – About | url=http://www.iww.org/history/library/iww/general-strike-didnt-happen-report-activity-iww-wisconsin | accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, the strike was said by some to be 'The General Strike that didn't happen' because eventually ongoing efforts at industrial action were "completely overwhelmed by the [[Wisconsin gubernatorial recall election|recall effort]]" against the governor during the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iww.org/history/library/iww/general-strike-didnt-happen-report-activity-iww-wisconsin|title=The general strike that didn't happen: a report on the activity of the IWW in Wisconsin – Industrial Workers of the World|website=www.iww.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Since 2012====

In 2012, the IWW moved its General Headquarters offices to 2036 West Montrose, [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name="IWW General Headquarters"/&gt;

The IWW waged an organizing campaign at Chicago-Lake Liquors in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] in 2013. The store, which advertises itself as the highest-volume liquor store in Minnesota, had a wage cap of $10.50 per hour, but in the face of IWW demands for the wage cap to be lifted, store management fired five organizers. On April 6, the Twin Cities branch of the union responded with a picket around the store informing customers of the situation. This was followed by a second picket on May 4, a day which customarily had heavy business at the store. The union claimed to have made "what should have been an extremely busy Saturday into a quiet afternoon inside the store".&lt;ref name=tcorganizer-cll&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tcorganizer.com/2013/05/16/the-struggle-continues-at-chicago-lake-liquors/ |title=The Struggle Continues at Chicago-Lake Liquors |last=O'Reilly |first=John |website=TCOrganizer.com |publisher=Twin Cities IWW |date=16 May 2013 |access-date=28 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230000417/https://tcorganizer.com/2013/05/16/the-struggle-continues-at-chicago-lake-liquors/ |archive-date=30 December 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After several months, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] announced that it found merit in the union's unfair dismissal complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iww.org/content/labor-board-sides-fired-workers-chicago-lake-liquors |title=Labor Board Sides With Fired Workers At Chicago-Lake Liquors |date=28 May 2013 |access-date=29 December 2016 |website=IWW.org |publisher=Industrial Workers of the World}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the union and store management agreed to a $32,000 settlement as a form of compensation to the fired workers and the campaign officially ended.

Workers at the Paulo Freire Social Justice Charter School in [[Holyoke, Massachusetts]] were organized with the IWW in 2015, hoping to address the "authoritarian leadership" of the school administration and perceived racial bias in hiring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://iww.org/content/paulo-freire-social-justice-charter-school-workers-organize-iww |title=Paulo Freire Social Justice Charter School workers organize into the IWW |date=16 May 2015 |access-date=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 September 2015, after a year long organizing campaign, workers at Sound Stage Production in North Haven Connecticut declared their membership in the IWW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iww.org/content/production-services-collective-workers-join-iww-iu630-0|title=Production Services Collective workers Join IWW iu630 {{!}} Industrial Workers of the World|website=www.iww.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a week they were threatened with legal action and fired. After several months of negotiation through the National Labor Relations Board, a settlement was reached and the workers agreed to back pay and severance compensation. As part of the campaign, the workers formed the Production Services Collective and continue as a workers cooperative and organizing with IWW-CT.

The IWW announced the [http://www.burgervilleworkersunion.org/ Burgerville Workers Union] (BVWU) in April 2016, which focuses on workers at the Oregon regional fast food chain, [[Burgerville]]. A subsidiary of the IWW, the BVWU went public on April 26 at a rally of workers and supporters outside a [[Portland, Oregon]] Burgerville location. Upon going public, the BVWU was endorsed by a number of local Oregon community organizations, including union locals, the Portland Solidarity Network, and food and racial justice organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://iww.org/content/burgerville-workers-unite |title=Burgerville Workers Unite! |website=IWW.org |publisher=Industrial Workers of the World |date=1 May 2016 |access-date=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also endorsed by then-[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] (I-Vt.).

==Outside the US==

===Australia===
Australia encountered the IWW tradition early. In part this was due to the local [[De Leonist]] [[Socialist Labor Party|SLP]] following the industrial turn of the US SLP. The SLP formed an IWW Club in Sydney in October 1907. Members of other socialist groups also joined it, and the special relationship with the SLP soon proved to be a problem. The 1908 split between the Chicago and Detroit factions in the United States was echoed by internal unrest in the Australian IWW from late 1908, resulting in the formation of a pro-Chicago local in [[Adelaide]] in May 1911 and another in Sydney six months later. By mid-1913 the "Chicago" IWW was flourishing and the SLP-associated pro-Detroit IWW Club in decline.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, ''Industrial Labour and Politics: The Dynamics of the Labour Movement in Eastern Australia 1900–1921'', p&amp;nbsp;56–58 p&amp;nbsp;64–66, Australian National University Press, Canberra, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916 the "Detroit" IWW in Australia followed the lead of the US body and renamed itself the Workers' International Industrial Union.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, ''Industrial Labour and Politics: The Dynamics of the Labour Movement in Eastern Australia 1900–1921'', p 150, Australian National University Press, Canberra, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

The early Australian IWW used a number of tactics from the US, including free speech fights. However, there early appeared significant differences of practice between the Australian IWW and its US parent; the Australian IWW tended to co-operate where possible with existing unions rather than forming its own, and in contrast with the US body took an extremely open and forthright stand against involvement in World War One. The IWW cooperated with many other unions, encouraging industrial unionism and militancy. In particular, the IWW's strategies had a large effect on the [[Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union#Early history: the AMIEU and the Australian IWW|Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union]]. The AMIEU established closed shops and workers councils and effectively regulated management behaviour toward the end of the 1910s.

[[File:IWW anti-conscription poster 1916.jpg|thumb|alt="To arms! Capitalists, parsons, politicians, landlords, newspaper editors and other stay-at-home patriots. Your country needs YOU in the trenches! Workers, follow your masters."|Australian anti-conscription poster, 1916]]
The IWW was well known for opposing the First World War from 1914 onwards, and in many ways was at the front of the [[Conscription in Australia#World War I|anti-conscription fight]]. A narrow majority of Australians voted against conscription in a very bitter hard-fought referendum in October 1916, and then again in December 1917, Australia being the only belligerent in World War One without conscription. In very significant part this was due to the agitation of the IWW, a group which probably never had as many as 500 members in Australia at its peak. The IWW founded the Anti-Conscription League (ACL) in which members worked with the broader labour and peace movement, and also carried on an aggressive propaganda campaign in its own name; leading to the imprisonment of [[Tom Barker (trade unionist)|Tom Barker]] (1887–1970) the editor of the IWW paper ''[[Direct Action (newspaper)|Direct Action]]'', sentenced to twelve months in March 1916. A series of arson attacks on commercial properties in Sydney was widely attributed to the IWW campaign to have Tom Barker released. He was indeed released in August 1916, but twelve mostly prominent IWW activists, the so-called [[Sydney Twelve]] were arrested in NSW in September 1916 for arson and other offences. (Their trial and eventual imprisonment would become a ''cause célèbre'' of the Australian labour movement on the basis that there was no convincing evidence that any of them had been involved in the arson attacks.) A number of other scandals were associated with the IWW, a five-pound note forgery scandal, the so-called [[Sydney Twelve|Tottenham tragedy]] in which the murder of a police officer was blamed on the IWW, and above all it was blamed for the defeat of the October 1916 conscription referendum. In December 1916 the Commonwealth government led by Labour Party renegade [[Billy Hughes]] declared the IWW an illegal organization under the [[Crimes Act 1914|Unlawful Associations Act]]. Eighty six members immediately defied the law and were sentenced to six months imprisonment.  ''Direct Action'' was suppressed, its circulation was at its peak of something over 12,000.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book | last=Turner | first=Ian | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=1965 | title=Industrial Labour and Politics: The Dynamics of the Labour Movement in Eastern Australia 1900–1921 | publisher=Australian National University Press | location=Canberra | id= | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war over 100 members Australia-wide were sentenced to imprisonment on political charges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Oliver | first=Bobbie | authorlink= | coauthors= | year=1995 | title=War and Peace in Western Australia: The Social and Political Impact of the Great War 1914–1926 | publisher=University of Western Australia Press | location=Western Australia | isbn=1-875560-57-2 | page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the veteran activist [[Monty Miller]].

The IWW continued illegally operating with the aim of freeing its class war prisoners and briefly fused with two other radical tendencies – from the old Socialist parties and Trades Halls – to form a larval communist party at the suggestion of the militant revolutionist and [[Council Communist]] [[Adela Pankhurst]]. The IWW, however, left the [[Communist Party of Australia|CPA]] shortly after its formation.

By the 1930s the organisation in Australia had declined significantly, and took part in unemployed workers movements which were led largely by the CPA. The poet [[Harry Hooton]] became involved with it around this time. In 1939 the Australian IWW had four members, according to surveillance by government authorities, and these members were consistently opposed to the Second World War.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} After the Second World War, the IWW would become one of the influences on the [[Sydney Push|Sydney Libertarians]] who were in turn a significant cultural and political influence

Today{{when|date=February 2018}} the IWW still exists in Australia, in larger numbers than the 1940s, but due to the nature of the Australian industrial relations system, it is unlikely to win union representation in any workplaces in the immediate future. More significant is its continuing place in the mythology of the militant end of the Australian labour movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130116134601/http://workers.labor.net.au/102/c_historicalfeature_wobbly.html "Flowers For the Rebels Faded"].

Released from prison in August 1920 he would soon break with the IWW over its anti-political stand, standing for the NSW Parliament for the [[Industrial Socialist Labour Party]] unsuccessfully in 1922 and then in 1925 for the mainstream [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) also unsuccessfully. However, this reconciliation with the ALP and the electoral system did not prevent him being imprisoned again in 1927 for street demonstrations supporting [[Sacco and Vanzetti]]. He would eventually represent the ALP in the NSW Legislative Council in 1931–1940 and the Australian Senate 1943–1956.&lt;ref&gt;Farrell, Frank.

Accessed November 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; No other member of the Australian IWW actually entered Parliament but Grant's career is emblematic in the sense that the ex-IWW militants by and large remained in the broader labour movement, bringing some greater or lesser part of their heritage with them.

It was written by ship's fireman William "Bill" Casey, later Secretary of the Seaman's Union in Queensland.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Canada===
The IWW was active in Canada from a very early point in the organization's history, especially in Western Canada, primarily in [[British Columbia]]. The union was active in organizing large swaths of the lumber and mining industry along the coast, in the Interior of BC, and [[Vancouver Island]]. Joe Hill wrote the song "Where the Fraser River Flows" during this period when the IWW was organizing in British Columbia.  Some members of the IWW had relatively close links with the Socialist Party of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socialisthistory.ca/Docs/Imposs/Impossibilists1.htm |title=Canadian Socialist History Project |publisher=Socialisthistory.ca | date=1919-06-11 |accessdate=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur "Slim" Evans]], organizer in the [[Relief Camp Workers' Union]] and the [[On-to-Ottawa Trek]] was once a Wobbly, although during the On-to-Ottawa Trek he was with the [[One Big Union (Canada)|One Big Union]]. He was also a friend of another well-known Canadian, [[Ginger Goodwin]], who was shot in [[Cumberland, British Columbia]] by a [[Dominion Police]] constable when he was resisting the [[First World War]].  The impact of Ginger Goodwin influenced various left and progressive groups in Canada, including a progressive group of MPs in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] called the [[Ginger Group]].

Despite the IWW being banned as a subversive organization in Canada during the First World War, the organization rebounded swiftly after being unbanned after the war, reaching a post-WWI high of 5600 Canadian members in 1923.&lt;ref name=ARLO1924&gt;{{cite report |date=1924 |title=Annual Report on Labour Organizations |url=https://archive.org/details/reportoflabour192325cana |publisher=[[Employment and Social Development Canada|Department of Labour (Canada)]] |accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The union entered a short "golden age" in Canada with an official Canadian Administration located at the [[Finnish Labour Temple]] in Port Arthur (now [[Thunder Bay, Ontario]]) and a strong base among immigrant labourers in [[Northern Ontario]] and [[Manitoba]], especially [[Finns]], which included harvest workers, lumberjacks, and miners. During this period, the IWW would compete for members with a number of other radical and socialist organizations such as the [[Finnish Organization of Canada]] (FOC), with the IWW's ''[[Industrialisti]]'' newspaper competing with the FOC's ''[[Vapaus]]'' for attention and readership. During this period. Membership slowly decreased during the 1920s and 30s despite continued organizing and strike activity as the IWW lost ground to the [[One Big Union (Canada)|One Big Union]] and Communist Party-controlled organizations such as the [[Workers' Unity League]] (WUL). Despite this competition, the IWW and WUL cooperated during strikes, such as at the [[Abitibi Pulp &amp; Paper Company]] near [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] in 1933, where the Finnish workers in the IWW and WUL faced discrimination and violence from the Anglo citizens of the town. The IWW also successfully unionized [[Ritchie's Dairy]] in [[Toronto]] and formed a fishery workers' branch in MacDiarmid (now [[Greenstone, Ontario]]).&lt;ref name=Jewell&gt;{{citation |last=Jewell |first=G. |year=1975 |title=The IWW in Canada |publisher=Industrial Workers of the World General Administration |publication-place=[[Chicago]] |url = https://libcom.org/library/iww-canada-g-jewell |accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, the IWW in Canada supported the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] and began to recruit for the militia of the anarcho-syndicalist [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT), in direct conflict with Communist Party recruiters for the [[Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion]], a conflict which resulted in a number of violent clashes at recruitment rallies in Northern Ontario. Several Canadian IWW members were killed in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the CNT's ensuing defeat at the hands of both Fascist and [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] forces.&lt;ref name=Jewell /&gt; By the middle of the [[Second World War]], IWW membership had dropped to 500, but had rebounded to 2000 by 1946. After this, the IWW entered a long period of decline, with the Canadian Administration slowly shrinking back to its traditional strongholds in Port Arthur and Vancouver, and becoming more of a social club and [[mutual aid society]] of mostly Finnish members in Port Arthur and the co-operative businesses they controlled. An [[Education Workers Industrial Union]] branch was established at the [[University of Waterloo]] in 1968, but failed to achieve success and dissolved. As well, in 1970 ''La Presse Populaire du Montréal'', an IWW-run print shop, was shut down under the [[War Measures Act]] due to its support for the [[FLQ]] during the [[October Crisis]]. As a sign of the times, the old Canadian Administration in Port Arthur was dissolved in 1973 and replaced by a Canadian Regional Organizing Committee, meaning that Canadian branches would be administrated by the General Administration in the United States. IWW activity in Canada began to shift largely toward strike support and labour activism, such as support for the Artistic Woodwork strike in Toronto in 1974. By the 80s, the Vancouver branch was supporting unemployed activism through the Vancouver Unemployed Action Centre by helping to shut down the scam operation Vancouver Job Mart and supporting the campaign for a fixed-income transit pass.

By the end of the 1990s, the IWW in Canada was following the general pattern of ascendancy, winning government recognition at Harvest Collective in Manitoba, the first shop certified in Canada since 1919. During the 2000s, branches were chartered in several new cities, and existing branches were revitalized. The dissolved Canadian Regional Organizing Committee was refounded in 2011.

Today the IWW remains active in the country with branches in [[Vancouver]], [[Vancouver Island]], [[Edmonton]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Ottawa|Ottawa/Outaouais]], [[Toronto]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Sherbrooke]], [[Québec City]] and [[Montréal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iww.ca|title=IWW Canada – a union for all workers – An independent union fighting for workers in Canada|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest branch is currently in Montréal. In August 2009, Canadian members voted to ratify the constitution of the Canadian Regional Organizing Committee (CanROC) to improve inter-branch coordination and communication. Affiliated branches are Winnipeg, Ottawa-Outaouais, Toronto, Windsor, Sherbrooke, Montréal and Québec City. Each branch elects a representative to make decisions on the Canadian board. There were originally three officers, the Secretary-Treasurer, Organizing Department Liaison, and Editor of the Canadian Organizing Bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;http://iww.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CANROC-Constitution-Final-January-1-2012.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, CanROC members voted to split the Secretary-Treasurer role into separate Regional Secretary and Regional Treasurer positions.

There are currently five job shops in Canada: Libra Knowledge and Information Services Co-op in Toronto, ParIT Workers Cooperative in Winnipeg, the Windsor Button Collective, the [[Ottawa Panhandlers' Union]] and the Street Labourers of Windsor (SLOW). The [[Ottawa Panhandlers' Union]] continues a tradition in the IWW of expanding the definition of worker. The union members include anyone who makes their living in the street, including [[buskers]], street vendors, the homeless, scrappers and panhandlers. In the summer of 2004, the Union led strike by the Homeless (the Homeless Action Strike) in Ottawa. The strike resulted in the city agreeing to fund a newspaper created and sold by the Homeless on the street. On May 1, 2006, the Union took over the Elgin Street Police Station for a day.

===Europe===

====Germany, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria====
The IWW started to organise in Germany following the First World War. [[Fritz Wolffheim]] played a significant role in establishing the IWW in Hamburg.
A German Language Membership Regional Organizing Committee (GLAMROC) was founded in December 2006 in [[Cologne]]. It encompasses the German-language area of Germany, Luxembourg, Austria, and Switzerland with branches or contacts in 16 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IWW IM DEUTSCHSPRACHIGEN RAUM (GLAMROC)|url = http://www.wobblies.de/iww/iww-im-deutschsprachigen-raum-glamroc|website = wobblies.de|accessdate = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the GLAMROC is reported as having 200 members in good standing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/DianeKrauthamer/iwwinter2016finalweb|title=Industrial Worker Winter 2016, Issue 1776, vol 113|last=Richter|first=Mark|date=2017-02-10|website=Industrial Worker|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wales, Ireland, Scotland, England ====

The regional body of the union in the United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland]] is the Wales, Ireland, Scotland, England Regional Administration (WISERA). Formerly known as the Britain and Ireland Regional Administration (BIRA), its name was changed as a result of a referendum vote by WISERA members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iww.org.uk/about/who-we-are/|title=Who We Are {{!}} IWW|website=iww.org.uk|access-date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Early history =====

The [[British Advocates of Industrial Unionism]], founded in 1906, supported the IWW.  This group split in 1908, with the majority supporting [[Daniel De Leon]] and a minority supporting [[E. J. B. Allen]] founding the Industrialist Union and developing links with the Chicago-based IWW.  Allen's group soon disappeared, but the first IWW group in Britain was founded by members of the [[Industrial Syndicalist Education League]] led by Guy Bowman in 1913.

The IWW was present to varying extents in many of the struggles in the early decades of the 20th century, including the [[UK General Strike of 1926]], and the dockers' strike of 1947. A Neath Wobbly who had been active in Mexico trained volunteers who went to the International Brigade to fight against Franco but did not return.

During the decade after [[World War II]], the IWW had two active branches in London and [[Glasgow]]. These soon died off, before a modest resurgence in northwest England during the 1970s.

===== Membership =====

Between 2001 and 2003, there was a marked increase in UK membership, with the creation of the Hull General Membership Branch. During this time the Hull branch had 27 members of good standing, being at that time the largest branch outside of the United States. By 2005, there were around 100 members in the United Kingdom. For the IWW's centenary, a stone was laid (51°41'598N 4°17.135W Geocacher), in a public access forest in Wales, commemorating the centenary of the union. As well, Sequoias were planted as a memorial to US IWW and [[Earth First!]] activist [[Judi Bari]]. 2006 saw the IWW formally registered by the UK government as a recognised [[trade union]].

The IWW currently has a presence in several major urban areas as well as regional centres, with chartered branches in [[London]], [[Glasgow]] (Clydeside GMB), Bradford, Bristol, Edinburgh, Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham, Reading, Sheffield, in the [[Tyne and Wear]] and [[West Midlands conurbation|West Midlands]] areas, and most recently in Wales.

Overall, membership has increased rapidly; in 2014, the union reported a total UK membership of 750,&lt;ref&gt;UK Government Certification Office 2014: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/452893/790T_2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which increased to 1000 by April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newsyndicalist.org/2015/05/30/step-up/ |title=Step Up |publisher=New Syndicalist |date=2015-05-30 |accessdate=2016-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the 1,500 member limit was passed

===== Campaigns =====

IWW members were involved in the [[Liverpool]] [[Stevedore|dockers]]' strike that took place between 1995 and 1998, and numerous other events and struggles throughout the 1990s and 2000s, including the successful unionising of several workplaces, such as support workers for the [[Scottish Socialist Party]].

Recently, the IWW has focused its efforts on health and education workers, publishing a national industrial newsletter for health workers and a specific bulletin for workers in the [[National Blood Service]]. In 2007 it launched a campaign alongside the anti-capitalist group [[No Sweat (organisation)|No Sweat]] which attempted to replicate some of the successes of the US IWW's organising drives amongst [[Starbucks]] workers. In the same year its health-workers' network launched a national campaign against cuts in the National Blood Service, which is ongoing.

Also in 2007, IWW branches in [[Glasgow]] and [[Dumfries]] were a key driving force in a successful campaign to prevent the closure of one of [[Glasgow University]]'s campuses, ([[The Crichton]]) in Dumfries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/glasgow_at_crichton/02.htm |title=Archive of Crichton Campaign |date=2007-08-29 |accessdate=2016-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign united IWW members, other unions, students and the local community to build a powerful coalition. Its success, coupled with the National Blood Service campaign, has raised the IWW's profile significantly since then.

In 2011, the IWW representing cleaners at the Guildhall won back-pay and the right to collective negotiation with their employers, Ocean. Also in 2011, branches of the IWW were set up in Lincoln, Manchester and Sheffield (notably workers employed by Pizza Hut).

The Edinburgh General Membership Branch of the IWW along with other branches of the IWW's Scottish section voted in 2014 to become a signatory to the "From Yes to Action Statement" produced by the [[Autonomous Centre of Edinburgh]]. In 2015, along with similar groups such as the [[Edinburgh Coalition Against Poverty]] and Edinburgh Anarchist Federation, they joined the Scottish [[Action Against Austerity]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://autonomous.org.uk/2014/11/21/yes-action-joint-statement-post-referendum-organising/|title=From Yes to Action – Joint statement on post-referendum organising |date=21 November 2014 |website=Autonomous.org.uk |publisher=[[Autonomous Centre of Edinburgh]] |access-date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, WISERA promoted a campaign targeting couriers working for companies such as [[Deliveroo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deliverunion.com/ |title=Deliver Union |website=DeliverUnion.com |publisher=Industrial Workers of the World |access-date=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IWW has been involved in organizing prisoners since 2012, with The Incarcerated Worker's Organizing Committee being formed in 2013. IWOC was pivotal in organizing The 2016 American Prisoners Strike against what it calls "slave labor conditions" in prison work programs. IWOC, allied with the Free State Movements (a collection of prisoner rights organizations aligned with The Free Alabama Movement).

In addition, the IWW has organized several high-profile restaurants and fast food chains including Burgerville, Ellen's Stardust Diner and Jimmy Johns. In many ways the IWW is responsible for the rise of larger movements like Fight for 15 and 15 Now that have sought to organize food service and retail workers into the larger unions.

An [http://iwwisland.org/ Iceland Regional Organizing Committee] (IceROC) was chartered in 2015. The union has become a trailblazer in supporting sex workers in Iceland, who lack access to services which do not automatically treat them as victims of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nswp.org/news/sex-worker-led-organisation-formed-iceland |title=Sex Worker-Led Organisation formed in Iceland |website=NSWP.org |publisher=[[Global Network of Sex Work Projects]] |date=31 August 2016 |access-date=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the IWW in Iceland has taken a strong position against the [[Prostitution in Sweden|Swedish model]] of policing sex work, where sex workers are not criminalized but their customers are, and instead has argued in favour of "organizing all workers without moral or legal judgement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/iwwisland/posts/653069678179845 |title=IWW: Organizing All Workers Without Moral or Legal Judgement |date=25 July 2016 |access-date=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2015, a Greek Regional Organizing Committee (GreROC) was chartered. In July of that year, it released a statement condemning the Greek government's response to the results of the [[Greek bailout referendum, 2015|2015 Greek bailout referendum]], saying that "despite the Left tone of dignity that the Left governmental administrators use, this is a one-way blackmail.

===Africa===
====South Africa====
{{Main|Industrial Workers of the World (South Africa)}}

The IWW has a rich and complex history in South Africa, with an original South African IWW organization being founded in 1910 and existing through most of the 1910s until disintegrating by around 1916.&lt;ref name=threefigures&gt;{{cite news |last=van der Walt |first=Lucien |date=November 2011 |title=A look at three figures from the IWW in South Africa |url=https://iww.org/PDF/IndustrialWorker/IWMay2011.pdf |newspaper=[[Industrial Worker]] |publisher=Industrial Workers of the World |location=[[Chicago]] |page=15 |access-date=28 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The union's insistence on multiracial unionism set it at odds with the white trade union movement and brought severe political repression from the [[apartheid]]-era South African government. The major South African port of [[Durban]] was an important link in the IWW's international network which was largely maintained by its [[Marine Transport Workers Industrial Union]], that connected the mainline North American IWW to ports in Africa, India, South America, and Australasia.

After the collapse of the formal IWW organization in South Africa, it would be succeeded by an [[Industrial Socialist League]], the [[Industrial Workers of Africa]], and finally the [[Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union]] (ICU), which would become the major black union in South Africa in the 1920s and 30s. Nevertheless, IWW and syndicalist influences would decline as the black workers' movement was brought into the trade union fold and came under the domination of the [[Communist Party of South Africa]], which opposed syndicalist tendencies in the unions.&lt;ref name=sawobblies&gt;{{cite news |last=Philips |first=John |url=https://libcom.org/history/south-african-wobblies-origins-industrial-unions-south-africa-john-philips |title=Digging into IWW History: South Africa |newspaper=Industrial Worker |publisher=Industrial Workers of the World |page=8 |date=October 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost a hundred years later, multiple attempts were made to rebuild the South African IWW, with a short-lived South African Regional Organising Committee being founded in the early 2000s in Durban and attempts made to build a branch in [[Cape Town]] in the early 2010s, with neither resulting in success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://saasha.net/2014/01/06/industrial-workers-of-world-pamphlet-durban-early-2000s/ |title=Industrial Workers of World pamphlet, Durban, early 2000s |last=van der Walt |first=Lucien |date=6 January 2014 |access-date=28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, IWW members in [[Uganda]] formed a Ugandan Regional Organizing Committee (ROC) and began to raise funds to establish a Ugandan office for the IWW. However, it was discovered that the union officers in Uganda had been violating the Constitution of the IWW in multiple ways, such as by permitting employers to join the union, and the ROC was dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anarkismo.net/article/22741|title=IWW Launches In Uganda|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folk music and protest songs==
[[File:Wobbly boy.jpg|thumb|alt=Booklet cover with large title, "IWW Songs", and illustration of a man climbing over a hill, reaching skyward, with factories in the background.|Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent: The "Little Red Songbook"]]

One Wobbly characteristic since their inception has been a penchant for song. To counteract management sending in the [[Salvation Army]] band to cover up the Wobbly speakers, [[Joe Hill]] wrote parodies of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[hymn]]s so that union members could sing along with the Salvation Army band, but with their own purposes. For example, "[[In the Sweet By and By]]" became "[[There'll Be Pie in the Sky When You Die (That's a Lie)]]". From that start in exigency, Wobbly song writing became common because they "articulated the frustrations, hostilities, and humor of the homeless and the dispossessed."&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluh, Joyce L., ''Rebel Voices: An I.W.W. Anthology'', University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, 1964 p.131&lt;/ref&gt; The IWW collected its official songs in the [[Little Red Songbook]] and continues to update this book to the present time. In the 1960s, the [[American folk music revival]] in the United States brought a renewed interest in the songs of Joe Hill and other Wobblies, and seminal folk revival figures such as [[Pete Seeger]] and [[Woody Guthrie]] had a pro-Wobbly tone, while some were members of the IWW. Among the [[protest song]]s in the book are "[[Hallelujah, I'm a Bum]]" (this song was never popular among members), "[[Union Maid]]", and "I Dreamed I Saw [[Joe Hill]] Last Night". Perhaps the best known IWW song is "[[Solidarity Forever]]". The songs have been performed by dozens of artists, and [[Utah Phillips]] performed the songs in concert and on recordings for decades. Other prominent IWW songwriters include [[Ralph Chaplin]] who authored "Solidarity Forever", and [[Leslie Fish]].

The Finnish IWW community produced several folk singers, poets and songwriters, the most famous being Matti Valentine Huhta (better known as [[T-Bone Slim]]), who penned "[[The Popular Wobbly]]" and "The Mysteries of a Hobo's Life". Slim's poem, "The Lumberjack's Prayer" was recorded by [[Studs Terkel]] on labor singer [[Bucky Halker]]'s ''Don't Want Your Millions''. [[Hiski Salomaa]], whose songs were composed entirely in Finnish (and [[Finglish]]), remains a widely recognized early folk musician in his native Finland as well as in sections of the Midwest United States, Northern Ontario, and other areas of North America with high concentrations of Finns. Salomaa, who was a tailor by trade, has been referred to as the Finnish [[Woody Guthrie]]. [[Arthur Kylander]], who worked as a lumberjack, is a lesser known, but important Finnish IWW folk musician. Kylander's lyrics range from the difficulties of the immigrant labourer's experience to more humorous themes. Arguably, the wanderer, a recurring theme in Finnish folklore dating back to pre-Christian oral tradition (as with [[Lemminkäinen]] in the [[Kalevala]]), translated quite easily to the music of Huhta, Salomaa, and Kylander; each of whom have songs about the trials and tribulations of the hobo.

==Lingo==
'''Wobbly lingo''' is a collection of [[technical language]], [[jargon]], and historic [[slang]] used by the Wobblies, for more than a century.  Many Wobbly terms derive from or are coextensive with [[Hobo#Expressions used through the 1940s|hobo expressions used through the 1940s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nelson|first=Eugene|title=Break Their Haughty Power: Joe Murphy in the Heyday of the Wobblies|pp=glossary pages 12i-15i|publisher=[[Ism Press]]|year=1993|isbn=9780910383318|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Break_Their_Haughty_Power.html?id=7xl-AAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iww.org/history/dictionary |title=IWW Union Dictionary and Glossary |publisher=Industrial Workers of the World |access-date=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the name "Wobbly" itself is uncertain.&lt;ref name="Wobbly-term-origin" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Mark|last=Leier|authorlink=Mark Leier|title=Where the Fraser River Flows: The Industrial Workers of the World in British Columbia|location=[[Vancouver]]|publisher=[[New Star Books]]|year=1990|pp=35, 54 ''n'' 8|isbn=978-0921586012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wobblies-film-1979"&gt;Stewart Bird and Deborah Shaffer (directors), ''The Wobblies'' (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; For several decades, many [[hobo]]s in the United States were members of, or were sympathetic to, the IWW. Because of this, some of the terms describe the life of a hobo such as "riding the rails", living in "jungles", dodging the "bulls". The IWW's efforts to organize all trades allowed the lingo to expand to include terms relating to [[mining camp]]s, [[lumberjack|timber work]], and farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OsGMuyFE_FQC|pp=110–111|title=Citizen Hobo: How a Century of Homelessness Shaped America|first=Todd|last=DePastino|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|year=2010|isbn=9780226143804}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G1I2AQAAMAAJ|pp=45–46|title=The Truth about the I.W.W.: Facts in Relation to the Trial at Chicago|author=[[American Civil Liberties Union]]|publisher=[[National Civil Liberties Bureau]]|year=1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some words and phrases believed to have originated within Wobbly lingo have gained cultural significance outside of the IWW. For example, from [[Joe Hill|Joe Hill's]] song "[[The Preacher and the Slave]]", the expression [[wikt:pie in the sky|pie in the sky]] has passed into common usage, referring to a "preposterously optimistic goal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Cultural Literacy |year=1988 |first=E.D. |last=Hirsch, Jr. |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Island Chain Strategy''' is a strategy first mentioned by American foreign policy commentator [[John Foster Dulles]] in 1951 during the [[Korean War]]. It suggests surrounding the [[Soviet Union]] and [[PRC|China]] by sea.&lt;ref&gt;Hiroyuki Umetsu,  "Communist China’s entry into the Korean hostilities and a US proposal for a collective security arrangement in the Pacific offshore island chain." ''Journal of Northeast Asian Studies'' (1996) 15#2 pp: 98–118.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The island chain concept did not become a major theme in American policy, however it has become a major fixation of Chinese analysts to this day. The concept heightens Chinese fears that they will be encircled by American forces, and emphasizes the geographical and strategic importance of [[Taiwan]]. It helps shape Chinese naval options and strategies, as well as playing a role in economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;Toshi Yoshihara, "China's Vision of Its Seascape: The First Island Chain and Chinese Seapower." ''Asian Politics &amp; Policy'' (2012) 4#3 pp. 293–314. DOI: 10.1111/j.1943-0787.2012.01349.x&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Chinese writings the Island Chain Strategy is divided into 3 parts, namely [[First island chain|First Island Chain]], the [[Second Island Chain]] and the [[Third Island Chain]].

== First Island Chain ==
{{Main|First island chain}}

The First Island Chain begins at the [[Kuril Islands]], and finishes towards [[Borneo]] and the northern portion of the [[Philippines]]. It is the first chain to block [[socialism|socialist]] countries aligned with the USSR, and after Soviet Russia is dealt with the chain would then turn its focus on China. The key part of the first chain would be [[Taiwan]].

Because the island chain is built up of a series of landmasses, it is also called the "[[unsinkable aircraft carrier]]", especially in reference to Taiwan.

== Second Island Chain ==
The Second Island Chain can refer to two different interpretations, but the version most commonly used refers to the island chain which is formed by the [[Ogasawara Islands]] and [[Volcano Islands]] of Japan, in addition to [[Mariana Islands]] which is United States territory.

As it is located within the middle portion of the Pacific Ocean, it acts as a second strategic defense line for the United States.

==Third Island Chain ==
The Third Island Chain is the final part of the strategy. Its island chain begins at the [[Aleutian Islands]], and finishes up in [[Oceania]]. The key part of the Third Island Chain would be the [[Hawaii]]an Islands of the United States.

== Target and events ==
The primary target of the doctrine was the USSR; however, additional targets also included the People's Republic of China and Vietnam. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|USSR collapsed]] in 1991, China soon became the major target of the doctrine.

'''MOVE''' is a [[Black theology|black liberation]] group founded in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] by [[John Africa]] (born Vincent Leaphart) in 1972. The name is not an acronym. The group lived in a [[commune|communal]] setting in [[West Philadelphia]], abiding by philosophies of [[anarcho-primitivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/move/|title=MOVE {{!}} Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|website=philadelphiaencyclopedia.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group combined revolutionary ideology, similar to that of the [[Black Panthers]], with work for animal rights. 

The group is particularly known for two major conflicts with the [[Philadelphia Police Department]]. In 1978, a standoff resulted in the death of one police officer, injuries to several other people, and [[life sentence]]s for nine members who were convicted of killing the officer. In 1985, another confrontation ended when a police helicopter dropped a bomb on the MOVE compound, a [[row house]] in the middle of the 6200 block of Osage Avenue. The resulting fire killed eleven MOVE members, including five children, and destroyed 65 houses in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Trippett"/&gt; The survivors later filed a civil suit against the city and the police department, and were awarded $1.5 million in a 1996 settlement.&lt;ref name="cnn96"/&gt;

== Origins ==

The group's name, MOVE, is not an acronym.&lt;ref name="USAaccount"&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-05-11-philadelphia-bombing_x.htm Account of 1985 incident from ''USA Today''].&lt;/ref&gt; Its name was chosen by John Africa to say what they intended to do. Members intend to be active because they say, "Everything that's alive moves. If it didn't, it would be stagnant, dead."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onamove.com/about/|title=About MOVE – On a Move|website=onamove.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; When members greet each other they say "On the MOVE"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

The group was originally called the Christian Movement for Life when it was founded in 1972. Its founder, [[John Africa]], was [[functionally illiterate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdrTAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR13&amp;lpg=PR13&amp;dq=john+africa+functionally+illiterate&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m0JA5zX81y&amp;sig=rJ0YLatpcxJiDHmNLLpbPH0vNEg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AAYxVbDRJMnvaOGIgagC&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=john%20africa%20functionally%20illiterate&amp;f=false|website=books.google.com|publisher=Google|accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had dictated his thoughts to  Donald Glassey, a [[social worker]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania]], and created what he called "The Guidelines" as the basis of the communal group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/move/|title=MOVE {{!}} Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|website=philadelphiaencyclopedia.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Africa and his contemporary, mostly [[African-American]] followers wore their hair in [[dreadlocks]], as popularized by the Caribbean [[Rastafari]] movement. MOVE advocated a radical form of [[green politics]] and a return to a [[hunter-gatherer]] society, while stating their opposition to science, medicine, and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An inauspicious beginning|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/special_packages/dailynews/20100506_An_inauspicious_beginning.html|website=philly.com|publisher=philly.com|accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

They identify as deeply religious and advocate for life. MOVE members believe that as all living beings are dependent, their lives should be treated in equal importance. They advocate for justice that is not always based within the institutions. MOVE believes in order for something to be just, it must be just for all living creatures.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As John Africa had done, his followers changed their surnames to Africa to show reverence to what they regarded as their mother continent.&lt;ref name = "Anderson &amp; Hevenor"&gt;John Anderson and Hilary Hevenor, ''Burning Down the House: MOVE and the tragedy of Philadelphia'', W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 1987, {{ISBN|0-393-02460-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn96"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9606/24/move.vertict/|title=CNN – Philadelphia, city officials ordered to pay $1.5 million in MOVE case |date= June 24, 1996|work=cnn.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DemocracyNow"/&gt;

In a 2018 article about the group, Ed Pilkington of ''[[The Guardian]]'' describes their political views as "a strange fusion of [[black power]] and [[flower power]]. The group that formed in the early 1970s melded the revolutionary ideology of the [[Black Panthers]] with the nature- and animal-loving communalism of 1960s [[hippies]]. You might characterise them as black liberationists-cum-eco warriors."&lt;ref name="siege"/&gt; He noted the group also functioned as an [[animal rights]] advocacy organization.

He quoted member Janine Africa, who wrote to him from prison: “We demonstrated against [[puppy mills]], [[zoos]], [[circuses]], any form of [[domestication|enslavement of animals]]. We demonstrated against [[Three Mile Island]] and industrial pollution. We demonstrated against [[police brutality]]. And we did so uncompromisingly. Slavery never ended, it was just disguised.”&lt;ref name="siege"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pilkington |first=Ed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/31/a-siege-a-bomb-48-dogs-and-the-black-commune-that-would-not-surrender|title=A siege. A bomb. 48 dogs. And the black commune that would not surrender|date=31 July 2018|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Africa and the MOVE members lived in a [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]] in a house owned by Glassey in the [[Powelton Village, Philadelphia|Powelton Village]] section of [[West Philadelphia]]. As activists, they staged [[bullhorn]]-amplified, [[profanity]]-laced [[demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] against institutions that they opposed, such as [[zoo]]s (MOVE had strong views on [[animal rights]]), and speakers whose views they opposed. MOVE activities were scrutinized by law enforcement authorities,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title='Let The Fire Burn': A Philadelphia Community Forever Changed|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/06/25/195533165/the-fire-that-transformed-a-philadelphia-community|website=npr.org|publisher=NPR|accessdate=2015-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survivor Remembers Bombing Of Philadelphia Headquarters|url=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2013/05/13/survivor-remembers-bombing-of-philadelphia-headquarters/|website=philadelphia.cbslocal.com|publisher=CBS Philly|accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly under the administration of Mayor [[Frank Rizzo]], a former police commissioner known for his hard line against activist groups.&lt;ref name="siege" /&gt;

== 1978 shoot-out ==
&lt;!-- This section heading is the target of the Rdrs "Move Nine", "MOVE 9", etc. They must be retargetted if this section's title stops being "1978 shoot-out" --&gt; 
 
In 1977, the police under Mayor [[Frank Rizzo]] obtained a [[court order]] requiring MOVE to vacate their Powelton Village house at 311 N 33rd Street. The group had begun to occupy the residence, and it was not long before MOVE's living style exhausted their neighbors' patience. &lt;!-- Give example of what is meant --&gt;MOVE members made a treaty with the police. They agreed to move out of the premises and surrender their weapons if the police released their members who were held in city jails. The police held up their end of the deal, but MOVE members failed to comply.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nearly a year later, police had come to a standoff with members of the community, who had not left.&lt;ref&gt;The video from all the documentaries was shot from 310 N 33rd Street facing East-Northeast&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=2007-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the police attempted to enter the house, shooting erupted. [[Philadelphia Police Department]] officer James J. Ramp was killed by a shot to the back of the neck. MOVE representatives claimed that he was facing the house at the time and they denied MOVE's responsibility for his death.They said shooting broke out and Ramp was killed by a single bullet. Prosecutors alleged that MOVE members fired the fatal shot and charged Sims Africa and the other eight with collective responsibility for his death.

According to a 2018 article in ''The Guardian'', "Eyewitnesses, however, gave accounts suggesting that the shot may have come from the opposite direction to the basement, raising the possibility that Ramp was accidentally felled, by police fire. Move members continue to insist that they had no workable guns in their house at the time of the siege. Several months earlier, in May 1978, several guns – most of them inoperative – had been handed over to police at the Move house; however, prosecutors at the trial of the Move Nine told the jury that at the time of the August siege there had been functioning firearms in the house."&lt;ref name="huge"/&gt; The standoff lasted about an hour before MOVE members began to surrender. 

===The MOVE 9===
"Prosecutors at the trial of the Move Nine told the jury that at the time of the August siege there had been functioning firearms in the house."&lt;ref name="huge"/&gt; MOVE spokesmen said they did not have working weapons.&lt;ref name="huge"/&gt; The MOVE 9 were convicted of [[third-degree murder]] for Ramp's death; each was sentenced to a maximum of 100 years in prison. They were Chuck, Delbert, Eddie, Janet, Janine, Merle, Michael, Phil, and Debbie Africa.

In 1998, at age 47, Merle Africa died in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.philly.com/1998-03-14/news/25744533_1_prison-job-move-press-conference-move-compound Move Death Merle Africa's Demise Labeled `Suspicious'], ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 14 March 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Seven of the surviving eight members first became eligible for [[parole]] in the spring of 2008, but they were denied. Parole hearings for each of these prisoner were to be held yearly from that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On June 16, 2018, Debbie Sims Africa, who was 22 when sentenced, was released on parole and reunited with her 39-year-old son, Michael Davis Africa, Jr. She gave birth to him a month after she was imprisoned, and he was taken from her a week later. The release of Sims Africa renewed attention on members of MOVE and the Black Panthers who remain imprisoned in the US from the period of the 1960s and 1970s; there are about twenty-five.&lt;ref name="huge"/&gt; 

As of June 2018, the remaining six in prison of the MOVE Nine convicted for the 1978 death were Chuck Sims Africa, Delbert Orr Africa, Eddie Goodman Africa, Janine Phillips Africa, Janet Hollaway Africa, and Michael Davis Africa, Sr.&lt;ref name="huge"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pilkington |first1=Ed |title='This is huge': black liberationist speaks out after her 40 years in prison |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/18/debbie-sims-africa-free-prison-move-nine-philadelphia-police |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=Jun 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 23, 2018, Michael Davis Africa, the husband of Debbie Sims Africa, was released on parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=D'Onofrio |first1=Michael |title=Another MOVE 9 member tied to 1978 case leaves prison |url=http://www.phillytrib.com/news/another-move-member-tied-to-case-leaves-prison/article_527cb30d-ca63-5a87-8af7-77a1ece0a337.html |accessdate=26 October 2018 |work=The Philadelphia Tribune |date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1985 bombing ==

In 1981 MOVE relocated to a [[terraced house|row house]] at 6221 Osage Avenue in the [[Cobbs Creek, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Cobbs Creek]] area of West Philadelphia. Neighbors complained to the city for years about trash around their building, confrontations with neighbors, and that MOVE members were broadcasting sometimes obscene political messages by [[bullhorn]].&lt;ref name=Trippett1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Still Black, Still Strong"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abu-Jamal|first1=Mumia|last2=Bin Wahad|first2=Dhoruba|last3=Shakur|first3=Assata|title=Still Black, Still Strong|date=1993|publisher=Semiotext(e)|location=South Pasadena, CA|isbn=9780936756745|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bullhorn was broken and inoperable for the three weeks prior to the police bombing of the row house.&lt;ref name="Still Black, Still Strong"/&gt;

The police obtained [[arrest warrant]]s in 1985 charging four MOVE occupants with crimes including [[parole]] violations, [[contempt of court]], [[illegal possession of firearms]], and making [[terrorist threat]]s.&lt;ref name="Trippett" &gt;{{cite web|last=Trippett |first=Frank |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,141842,00.html |title=It Looks Just Like a War Zone |publisher=TIME |date=1985-05-27 |accessdate=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor [[Wilson Goode]] and police commissioner [[Gregore J.

On Monday, May 13, 1985, nearly 500 police officers, along with city manager [[Leo A. Brooks, Sr.|Leo Brooks]], arrived in force and attempted to clear the building and execute the arrest warrants.&lt;ref name=Shapiro2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Water and electricity was shut off in order to force MOVE members out of the house. Commissioner Sambor read a long speech addressed to MOVE members that started with, "Attention MOVE... this is America". When the MOVE members did not respond, the police decided to forcefully remove the members from the house.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There was an armed [[wiktionary:Standoff|standoff]] with police,&lt;ref name="USAaccount"/&gt; who lobbed [[tear gas]] canisters at the building. The MOVE members fired at them and a gunfight with [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] and [[automatic firearm]]s ensued.&lt;ref name="Stevens 1985"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stevens|first=William K.|title=Police Drop Bomb on Radicals' Home in Philadelphia|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/MOVE-Phihladelphia-BombNYT14may85.htm|accessdate=31 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 May 1985|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612050152/http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/MOVE-Phihladelphia-BombNYT14may85.htm|archivedate=12 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police went through over ten thousand rounds of ammunition before Commissioner Sambor ordered that the compound be bombed.&lt;ref name="Stevens 1985"/&gt; From a Pennsylvania State Police helicopter, [[Philadelphia Police Department]] Lt. Frank Powell proceeded to drop two one-pound bombs (which the police referred to as "entry devices"&lt;ref name=Shapiro2010/&gt;) made of FBI-supplied [[water gel explosive]], a [[dynamite]] substitute, targeting a fortified, bunker-like cubicle on the roof of the house.&lt;ref name=Trippett1/&gt;

The resulting explosions ignited a fire from fuel for a gasoline-powered generator in the rooftop bunker; it spread and eventually destroyed approximately 65 nearby houses.  Despite the earlier drenching of the building by firefighters, officials said they feared that MOVE would shoot at the firefighters.&lt;ref name="DemocracyNow"&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2010/5/13/25_years_ago_philadelphia_police_bombs 25 Years Ago: Philadelphia Police Bombs MOVE Headquarters Killing 11, Destroying 65 Homes], democracynow.org.

=== Aftermath ===

Mayor Goode appointed an investigative commission called the Philadelphia Special Investigation Commission (PSIC,  aka MOVE Commission), chaired by [[William H. Brown, III]]. Police commissioner [[Gregore J. Sambor]] resigned in November 1985; in a speech the following year, he said that he was made a "surrogate" by Goode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.mcall.com/1986-02-27/news/2510505_1_gregore-j-sambor-move-confrontation-police-officers I Was Expendable, Sambor Learned After Move Fiasco]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The MOVE Commission issued its report on March 6, 1986. The report denounced the actions of the city government, stating that "Dropping a bomb on an occupied row house was unconscionable."&lt;ref name="titlePhiladelphia Special Investigation (MOVE) Commission Manuscript Collection"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.temple.edu/collections/urbana/psic-01.jsp |title=Philadelphia Special Investigation (MOVE) Commission Manuscript Collection |accessdate=2008-04-12 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the release of the report, Goode made a formal public apology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.mcall.com/1986-03-10/news/2508939_1_mayor-w-wilson-goode-move-affair-five-children Goode Offers His Apology For Move]&lt;/ref&gt;  No one from the city government was criminally charged in the attack. The only surviving adult MOVE member, Ramona Africa, was charged and convicted on charges of riot and conspiracy; she served seven years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Odom|first1=Maida|title=Ramona Africa Given Jail Term For Siege Role|url=http://articles.philly.com/1986-04-15/news/26077019_1_ramona-africa-birdie-africa-riot-charge|website=philly.com|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 a federal [[jury]] ordered the city to pay a [[US$]] 1.5 million [[civil suit]] judgement to survivor Ramona Africa and relatives of two people killed in the bombing. The jury had found that the city used [[excessive force]] and violated the members' [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Warrant|protections against unreasonable search and seizure]].&lt;ref name="NYT_1996-06-25"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DEFDE1239F936A15755C0A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Philadelphia Held Liable For Firebomb Fatal to 11 |website=[[The New York Times]] |date=1996-06-25 | first=Don | last=Terry | accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 Philadelphia was given the [[sobriquet]] "The City that Bombed Itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Compass American Guides Pennsylvania|author1=G.

== 2002 shooting of John Gilbride ==

After John Africa's death, his widow, Alberta, married John Gilbride, Jr. Together they had a child, Zackary Africa, circa 1996. The couple [[divorce]]d in 1999. Gilbride no longer supported MOVE and resettled in [[Maple Shade, New Jersey]]. Alberta Africa was living in [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey]] with their son John Zachary Gilbride, as he was legally known.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

On September 10, 2002, in the course of their bitter custody dispute, Gilbride testified in court that MOVE had threatened to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;October 23, 2003, Yanney, Monika Yant. "Talks of threats before slaying",  ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', posted in Religion News blog [http://www.religionnewsblog.com/4817/talks-of-threats-before-slaying]&lt;/ref&gt; The court granted Gilbride partial custody of Zackary, allowing him unsupervised visits.  

On September 27, 2002, shortly after midnight and prior to Gilbride's first visitation date with Zackary, an unknown assailant shot and killed Gilbride with an [[automatic weapon]] as he sat in his car parked outside his New Jersey home. &lt;ref name="AP"&gt;[https://www.theintelligencer.com/news/article/Man-in-Custody-Battle-Shot-to-Death-10572580.php Geoff Mulvihill (AP), "Man in Custody Battle Shot to Death"], ''Edwardsville Intelligencer'', 26 September 2002; accessed 15 Aug 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators did not name a suspect and the Burlington County Police did not release ballistics information.&lt;ref name="yanney2"&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/columnists/monica_yant_kinney/20120919_Monica_Yant_Kinney__Murder_of_ex-MOVE_member_remains_a_mystery.html Monica Yant Kinney, "Murder of ex-MOVE member remains a mystery", ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', 19 Sept 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

The case remains unsolved. A MOVE spokeswoman initially said that the U.S. government had [[assassination|assassinated]] Gilbride in order to frame MOVE.&lt;ref name="yanney2"/&gt; His ex-wife Alberta Africa denied that the murder had occurred. She said in 2009 that Gilbride "is out hiding somewhere."&lt;ref name="yanney2"/&gt; Tony Allen, an ex-MOVE member, says that MOVE murdered Gilbride.&lt;ref name="yanney2"/&gt;

In 2012 the ''Philadelphia Inquirer'' reported that Gilbride had told friends and family that he had recorded incriminating evidence in a notebook as security against a "hit" by MOVE. Gilbride said he had placed the notebook inside a locker for safekeeping. The [[Burlington County]] Prosecutor's Office declined to follow up on the report.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/inq-blinq/A-clue-hidden-in-a-lost-locker.html "A clue hidden in a lost locker?"], Blog, ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', 12 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current activities ==

Ramona Africa acts as a spokesperson for the group. She has given numerous speeches at events in the United States and other countries. [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]], a journalist and activist, was convicted and originally sentenced to death for the unrelated 1981 murder of police officer [[Daniel Faulkner]]. In 2011 his sentence was commuted to life. He had reported on MOVE and expressed his support for them. MOVE continues to advocate for Abu-Jamal's release as well as for that of imprisoned MOVE members. MOVE regards them all as [[political prisoner]]s.

Birdie Africa, also known as {{anchor|Michael Moses Ward}} Michael Moses Ward, was the only child to survive the 1985 MOVE bombing. As an adult, he accidentally drowned in 2013 in a hot tub on board the ship ''[[Carnival Dream]]'' while cruising in the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Birdie-Africa-MOVE-Ship-Hot-Tub-Death-262845331.html Davies, Dave.

'''Maria Gomori''',  [[Master of Social Work|M.S.W.]], [[Diploma of Counselling|Dip.C.]], Ph.D. (born May 25, 1920) is a pioneer in the field of systems [[family therapy]]. She has a long and disciplined background, and has made significant contributions to the fields of psychiatric and [[social work]] training, having designed numerous successful training programs. She is the foremost living proponent of the Satir Method for Family Therapy in the world. In 2004, she was named "Woman of Distinction" for the field of Health and Wellness  by the City of [[Winnipeg]].  In the same year Winnipeg's Saint Boniface Hospital Research Centre established a lectureship in her name to honour her long and varied contributions to the health system and the people who use it.&lt;ref name="Vesely2004"&gt;{{Harv |Vesely|2004|p=D8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
She earned a B.A. at the [[Sorbonne]], an Economics degree in her native [[Budapest]], an M.S.W. at the [[University of Manitoba]], Dip.C. from the [[Haven Institute]] and Ph.D. from the Open International University. Dr. Gomori developed the family therapy training program for the residents in psychiatry at St. Boniface Hospital in Winnipeg, MB, and was the Coordinator and Director of the Social Work Department at this hospital for 14 years.   Since her retirement, she has continued to lecture and offer seminars and workshops around the world, teaching annually in [[China]] and [[Taiwan]] and North America, even at the age of 88.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Marshall|2005|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has collaborated with [[Bennet Wong]] and [[Jock McKeen]] for over thirty years, and is an Emeritus Faculty of the [[Haven Institute]].

Her life story is one of courage.  After enduring the [[Nazi]] incursion into her native Budapest in the 1940s, she completed her education and rose quickly in the Hungarian government's department of Economics.  She fled Hungary in 1956 in the midst of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]], and emerged in the free world without money or possessions with her husband and young son.  They moved to [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada, where she studied social work.  Her life focus has been on freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Usher|2002|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Winnipeg Free Press|2002|p=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Marshall|2006|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has received numerous honours and citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Winnipeg Free Press|2003|p=B5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Binning|2003|p=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomori is a [[family therapist]] in private practice, and a retired Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at the [[University of Manitoba]]'s Faculty of Medicine. Gomori also is a Clinical Member and Approved Supervisor with AAMFT, the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy. She worked intensively with [[Virginia Satir]] for over 20 years and has been a faculty member and advanced trainer in Satir's ''Avanta International Training Organization'' since 1981. Dr. Gomori is also a certified practitioner and Master Programmer in [[Neuro-linguistic programming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Vesely|2003|p=B3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==
Maria Gomori has established an international reputation as a workshop leader, teaching, demonstrating and applying her interpretation of the Satir model. She has conducted workshops throughout Canada, the United States, Europe, South America, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China and Australia. She co-authored with Virginia Satir et al. ''The Satir Approach to Communication'' and ''The Satir Model: Family Therapy and Beyond''; the latter book was chosen by the AAMFT Foundation for the 1994 Satir Education and Research Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Family Therapy News|1994|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gomori has worked tirelessly in her international lectures and seminars; she been instrumental in establishing ''Satir Institutes'' in Winnipeg, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Australia, and is in great demand internationally for her workshops and training programs. She has a unique creative way of integrating [[Virginia Satir]]'s approach with her learnings from many other great teachers combined with her own experiences in living.&lt;ref name="Vesely2004" /&gt;

{{quote|''Maria's life is a testimony to the principles addressed by existential philosophies: freedom, authenticity, responsibility, and moral agency. With balance and courage, she also accepts the inevitable challenges of angst, loneliness, and paralysing uncertainties. Her mind is alive with ideas, concepts, and novel perspectives on human beings''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7186">A '''media prank''' is a type of [[media event]], perpetrated by staged speeches, activities, or press releases, designed to trick legitimate journalists into publishing erroneous or misleading articles.  The term may also refer to such stories if planted by fake journalists, as well as the false story thereby published.  A media prank is a form of [[culture jamming]] generally done as [[performance art]] or a [[practical joke]] for purposes of a humorous critique of [[mass media]].

==Notable instances==
In May 1927, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], who was known as one of the fiercest pranksters at the ''[[École Normale Superieure]]''&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Boulé [https://books.google.com/books?id=wlukeHj_TKEC&amp;pg=PA53 ''Sartre, self-formation, and masculinities''] p.53&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen-Solal1988p61"&gt;[[Annie Cohen-Solal|Cohen-Solal, Annie]] (1988) [https://books.google.com/books?id=vWbWlhHG-PEC ''Sartre: A Life''] pp.61-2 quote: {{quotation|During his first years at the Ecole, Sartre was the fearsome instigator of all the revues, all the jokes, all the scandals.}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized with his comrades Nizan, Larroutis, Baillou and Herland,&lt;ref&gt;Godo, Emmanuel (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=oT9lAAAAMAAJ ''Sartre en diable''] p.41&lt;/ref&gt; a media prank following [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s successful New York-Paris flight. Sartre &amp; Co. called newspapers telling them that Lindbergh would be awarded an honorary degree by the ''École''. Many newspapers including ''[[Le Petit Parisien]]'' announced the event on May 25 and thousands showed up, unaware that they were witnessing a stunt with a [[look-alike]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayman, Ronald (1987) [https://books.google.com/books?id=eCpBAQAAIAAJ ''Sartre: a life''] pp.69, 318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerassi89p76"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tameri.com/csw/exist/sartre.shtml Jean-Paul Sartre - philosopher, social advocate]&lt;/ref&gt; A scandal followed resulting in the resignation of the ''École'' director [[Gustave Lanson]].&lt;ref name="Gerassi89p76"&gt;John Gerassi (1989) [https://books.google.com/books?id=XStvJEokm7gC&amp;pg=PA76 ''Jean-Paul Sartre: Protestant or protester?''] pp.76-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yuL98MtZ5poC&amp;pg=PA26 Sartre By David Drake] p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

One well-known 1967 prank, orchestrated by [[Abbie Hoffman]] and [[Allen Ginsberg]] and chronicled in [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''[[Armies of the Night]]'', involved a mock gathering protesting the [[Vietnam War]] (that many media took as a serious but misguided effort) intended to [[levitate]] the [[the Pentagon|Pentagon]].&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

[[Joey Skaggs]] is one of the most prolific creators of media pranks in the United States, often using actors to stage outlandish public events that are then covered by news media as real stories.&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DF123EF930A15751C1A966958260|publisher=New York Times|title= The Merry Pranksters And the Art of the Hoax|date=1990-12-23|author=Mark Dery}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his many pranks, he convinced [[United Press International]] to report that cockroach hormones had been identified as a cure for arthritis,&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; and tricked [[WABC-TV]] in New York city to create a news segment (which was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] despite being untrue) about a supposed "[[Brothel|cathouse]] for dogs".&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt;

The band [[Negativland]] is (according to Time Magazine) "better known for media pranks than records".  The band, as an excuse for cancelling an upcoming tour, issued a press release claiming that a teenager who had committed a multiple [[ax murder]] did so after arguing with his parents over the meaning of its song, "[[Christianity Is Stupid]]".  The story was picked up and reprinted as true by mass media, and the band wrote later songs about having perpetrated the hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E3D8153BF93AA15751C1A962958260|author=Neil Strauss|date=1994-12-19|title=A Reluctant Success}}{{cite news|publisher=Boston Phoenix|url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/this_just_in/documents/04301666.asp|date=2004-12-03|title=Negativ energy:Hosler hits the road|author=Chris Dahlen|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006032023/http://bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/this_just_in/documents/04301666.asp|archivedate=2007-10-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003 the band issued a series of press releases accusing [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], Washington radio station [[KJR-FM]] of playing 1980s music despite claiming it only played "the best of the 60s and 70s" then, after the radio station changed its format, issued more press releases announcing that it had all been a prank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=02/09/13/5865550|title=Negativland Uses Mosquito Fleet To Bite Clear Channel and the NAB|date=2002-09-13|publisher=Infoshop news}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1999 with the fake campaign-oriented website gwbush.com, the [[Yes Men]] have impersonated famous celebrities, politicians, and business officials at appearances, interviews, websites, and other media to make political points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/chronicle/a/2004/10/03/PKGTP8VSB21.DTL|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|title=Pulling Pranks on Those in Power|author=John McMurtrie|date=2004-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December, 2009 an Argentina news station fell victim to a media prank. Acting on a Facebook link, an investigative reporter believed that the latest trend in underage drinking was tied to a new cocktail mix called Grog XD. Unbeknown to the reporter, the 
recipe was from the video game ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asylum.com/2009/12/02/reporter-uncovers-the-dangers-of-monkey-island-grog-xd/ |title=Reporter Uncovers the Dangers of Drinking Grog XD |publisher=Asylum.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8274Bk8-Bt8 |title=C5N - La irresponsabilidad de un noticiero |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
Although media pranks may serve as legitimate criticism of the press, and artistic creations in their own right, they are often criticized not only for the disruption they cause but as simple [[publicity stunt]]s that take advantage of the very failures of mass media that they ostensibly oppose.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt;  Skaggs has criticized the [[Flash mob]] movement, as being frivolous and lacking the [[counterculture|countercultural]] element of more serious protest art.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122119092302626987?mod=googlenews_wsj|date=2008-09-12|title=The New Pranksters|author=Ellen Gamerman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17251">'''Mildred Grossman''' (1916-1988) was a New York City public school teacher, civil rights activist, unionist, and an award-winning photographer associated with the [[Photo League]]. She led 32 other teachers in a civil case against the New York City Public Schools and the state's McCarthy-era Feinberg ‘loyalty’ Law.

==Education and membership of the Teachers Union==
Mildred Grossman was born in [[Brooklyn]], NY, in 1916 eldest daughter of Lewis J. and Maybella Grossman, and sister of Mitchell, Henrietta and Leonard.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ancestry.com/1940-census/usa/New-York/Mildred-M-Grossman_9jwpv Mildred M Grossman in the 1940 Census]&lt;/ref&gt; She studied Business Administration and in 1937 earned a bachelor's degree with a Teaching Certificate from the College of Business and Accounting of the [[Baruch College|City College of New York]]. There, as President of the Girls Club in 1935, she was notable for her campaign to secure readmission of women banned from studying at the College,&lt;ref&gt;[https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1016&amp;context=bb_arch_ticker 'Girls' Re-entry Form Called for Thursday: Addresses by Prominent Figures to Feature 5S Rally.

''The Ticker'', School of Business and Civic Administration, College of the City of New York, Monday, November 4, 1935.]&lt;/ref&gt; the formation of a student union and defence of academic freedom,&lt;ref&gt;[https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1026&amp;context=bb_arch_ticker 'College Delegates Voice Their Sentiments on Forming of American Student Union', ''The Ticker'', School of Business and Civic Administration, College of the City of New York, Monday, January 6, 1936]&lt;/ref&gt; and a youth allowance for needy students.&lt;ref&gt;[https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1035&amp;context=bb_arch_ticker 'AYA Passage Urged by 450 Delegates at Senate Hearing'. ''The Ticker'', School of Business and Civic Administration, College of the City of New York, Monday March 23, 1936]&lt;/ref&gt;  While studying she worked at [[Coty, Inc.|Coty Cosmetics]] in [[Manhattan]]. In 1939 she attended NYS Communist Party summer school before beginning teaching in business accounting at [[Norman Thomas High School|Central Commercial High School]] in Manhattan. She became active in the Teachers Union of NY and a member of the [[American Labor Party]].

== Photographer ==
In the late 1940s she joined the Photo League of NY, taking classes in [[Documentary photography|documentary]] and [[street photography]], subsequently being given work as staff photographer for ''Teacher News'', the publication of the Teachers' Union. She photographed the annual Teachers Union Educational Conferences at the [[Waldorf Astoria New York|Waldorf-Astoria]] and the Academic Freedom rallies. Her subjects included speakers playwright [[Arthur Miller]] and [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] screenwriter [[Dalton Trumbo]], and she recorded educator/activist, [[W. E. B. Du Bois|Dr. W.E.B. Du Bois]] and actor/activist [[Paul Robeson]] receiving the TU's Award for Distinguished Service in the Cause of Education for Peace and Freedom.

When teachers demonstrated in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] over poor salaries, Grossman was present, and she recorded rallies in Washington for allied unions, and protests in NYC against unfair labor practices that included the Timone Resolution, which threatened both the TU and individual teachers who expressed their personal political beliefs.

== Red Scare and activism ==
The union actions Grossman documented were a response to the 1940 'Little [[Red Scare]]', which saw twenty-one states impose ‘loyalty oaths’ on teachers before, by 1946, fifteen more states had joined them. The [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], supported at times by military authorities, inspected public school and college textbooks and curricula to ensure that the authors, even those long deceased, had 'disclaimed Communism'. New York's  State Senator [[Frederic René Coudert Jr.|Frederic Coudert]] in 1940 scoured schools for "subversives", leading to the dismissal of professors without regard for their value and record as teachers.

Post-war, the purge instituted in New York in the state's 1949 Feinberg Law (Named after its sponsor, state senator [[Benjamin F. Feinberg|Benjamin Feinberg]]) requiring school districts to report on the loyalty of every teacher, annually, targeted left-wing leaders of the city's Teachers Union.&lt;ref&gt;The Feinberg Law. (1949). The New Republic, 121(24), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heins, Marjorie. “The Board of Education and the Feinberg Law.” Priests of Our Democracy: The Supreme Court, Academic Freedom, and the Anti-Communist Purge, NYU Press, 2013, pp. 69–86. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qfmg6.7.&lt;/ref&gt; A teacher's membership in ‘subversive’ organisations, including “writing of articles, the distribution of pamphlets, endorsement of speeches made or articles written or acts performed by others”, would be designated ‘disloyal’  by the state commissioner of education. By 1950, leaders of the New York City Teachers Union were being dismissed through these proceedings, provoking fear of ramping job losses that affected membership; Teachers Union numbers fell from 7,000 in 1946 to 2,000 by the end of the 1950 school year, enabling the New York City Board of Education to withdraw recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, Bud; Schultz, Ruth (2001), The price of dissent : testimonies to political repression in America, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0-520-22402-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mildred Grossman was subject to investigation and in 1953 was named as a former Communist at HUAC assistant corporation counsel Saul Moskoff's  interrogation conducted in an old warehouse without legal representation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Mildred Grossman (2001)  Imposing Cold War Orthodoxy: A Teachers Union Under Attack. In {{Citation | author1=Schultz, Bud | author2=Schultz, Ruth | title=The price of dissent : testimonies to political repression in America | publication-date=2001 | publisher=University of California Press | isbn=978-0-520-22402-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grossman fought back by directing the Talmudic admonitions of the ‘moser’ (informer) as ammunition against  Saul Moskoff,  a practicing Jew and  first vice president of Congregation Agudas Israel,  sending a letter to the members of his congregation citing a resolution against the "Informer Resolution" adopted by the New York Board of Rabbis.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Dr. Jansen from Saul Moskoff and Memorandum Re: New York  Board of Rabbis, 26 April 1955; and Letter from Leonard Boudin (Mildred  Grossman's attorney) to Saul Moskoff, 28 April 1955, cited in Back, A. (2001). Blacks, Jews and the Struggle to Integrate Brooklyn's Junior High School 258: A Cold War Story. Journal of American Ethnic History, 20(2), 38-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Moskoff, however, recruited his own rabbis to offer their interpretation, though Rabbi Sharfman warned Moskoff his opponents could most certainly produce Talmudic interpretation from another rabbi to the contrary. &lt;ref&gt;Letter from Rabbi Benajmin Sharfman to Saul Moskoff, 17 August 1953 and Letter from Saul Moskoff to Rabbi Theodore Adams, President, Rabbinical 
Council of America, 22 October 1953, cited in Back, A. (2001). Blacks, Jews and the Struggle to Integrate Brooklyn's Junior High School 258: A Cold War Story. Journal of American Ethnic History, 20(2), 38-69.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, when she refused to answer part of the Superintendent's question concerning past and present membership in the CP, she was first suspended from her teaching position, and after twelve years as a teacher, was dismissed, with 38 other NYC teachers, in April 1954 for “insubordination and conduct unbecoming” and the Board of Education's determination, in accordance with New York State's Feinberg Law, that she had not satisfactorily severed her ties to the Communist Party. 283 others resigned or retired to escape the ordeal, with one elementary teacher, recently bereaved of her husband, committing suicide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Grossman's 1955 appeal against her dismissal was denied by the State Commissioner of Education.

==Recognition for photography==
In the same year, two of Grossman's photographs appeared in the world-touring [[Museum of Modern Art]] exhibition ''[[The Family of Man]]'' selected by Edward Steichen and seen by 9 million visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author1=Steichen, Edward | author2=Norman, Dorothy |editor=Mason, Jerry | others=Sandburg, Carl, (writer of foreword), Lionni, Leo, (book designer), Stoller, Ezra, (photographer) | location=New York, N.Y. | title=The family of man : the photographic exhibition | publication-date=1955 | publisher=Museum of Modern Art / Maco Magazine Corporation | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10809600 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One shows an elderly couple promenading on a city street, their identical poses representing habituation in a long-term marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Bernhardt, Debra E | author2=Bernstein, Rachel Amelia, 1953- | author3=Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives | title=Ordinary people, extraordinary lives : a pictorial history of working people in New York City | publication-date=2000 | publisher=New York University Press | isbn=978-0-8147-9866-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of her other photograph, taken in Germany, is a grandmother's gleefully reciprocated pride in her grandchild. Steichen also included Grossman's works in the 1957 MoMA show ''Seventy photographers look at New York''.&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Modern Art (New York, N.Y.), &amp; Steichen, E. (1957). Seventy photographers look at New York. New York: Museum of Modern Art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barred from teaching but buoyed by this recognition, Grossman switched careers to begin freelancing as a photographer, working for the New York Hotel Trades Council,  and for the Hotel Workers Local #5 in NYC,  photographing their members on the job, as they participated in union elections, on the strike line, and at the Union hall. Her now historic pictures appeared in Union publications and displayed in her art exhibit ''Portrait of a Union''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hotelworkers.org/about/history/mildred-grossman    Mildred Grossman, NYC Teachers' Union Member, Photographer for the New York Hotel Trades Council: Online exhibition at The New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council, AFL-CIO, (Hotel Trades Council) site]&lt;/ref&gt;

She met [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Dr Martin Luther King]] in the union offices in 1957 and in support of [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]] she produced reportage on the [[Little Rock Nine]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the first African-American students to attend an integrated school, [[Little Rock Central High School|Little Rock Central High]], in [[Arkansas]] in September, 1957, as part of the initiative to [[Desegregation|desegregate]] Southern schools. Subjected to discrimination, harassment, and violence by their white classmates, they became iconic of African-Americans’ struggle for equality. Grossman photographed them in the summer of 1958, when they met with union leaders, diplomats, and elected officials honouring their courage and achievements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contentdm.ad.umbc.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/p16629coll3 Mildred Grossman Collection online at the Albin O. Kuhn Library &amp; Gallery of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)]&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Hotel Workers’ Union flew the Little Rock Nine students to New York and presented them with the Better Race Relations Award.  

Grossman's photographs&lt;ref&gt;Grossman's photographs from this period are stamped, in red ink, "photograph by mildred grossman, 35-24 78th ST., Jackson Heights 72, N.Y. HA 6-0740, Circle 5-7000" and with a second stamp, also in red ink "[[American Society of Media Photographers|ASMP MEMBER, AMERICAN SOCIETY OF MAGAZINE PHOTOGRAPHERS]]". See: Mildred Grossman Collection online at the Albin O. Kuhn Library &amp; Gallery of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)&lt;/ref&gt;  show the students as they visit the Statue of Liberty, the United Nations Headquarters, City Hall, the Local 6 Civil Rights Award Ceremony, and the Coney Island theme parks.  One member of the group, Carlotta Walls LaNier recalls in interview with Lisa Frazier Page in ''A mighty long way: my journey to justice at Little Rock Central High School,'' that;

{{quote| We were even accompanied by the union's photographer, Mildred Grossman, a tiny lady who didn't seem at all weighed down by the ton of photo equipment she lugged around. She seemed different from the other professional photographers we had encountered. She tried not to be intrusive, though she snapped photos at every turn. In later years, when l learned her history, I would understand why she seemed so empathetic toward us. She knew what it was like to be singled out unjustly.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=LaNier, Carlotta Walls | author2=Page, Lisa Frazier | title=A mighty long way : my journey to justice at Little Rock Central High School | publication-date=2009 | publisher=One World Ballantine Books | edition=1st | isbn=978-0-345-51100-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

==Later career==
Grossman continued her work as a union activist, photographer, and teacher until her death from cancer in 1988. In 1958 Grossman married Motel "Mark" Berkowitz, a [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|Holocaust survivor]] with whom, in 1965, she traveled to [[Poland]], his homeland. The next year she won a Polish competition with her image ''Strike Rally''. She had previously, in 1960, won 'America's Many Faces', sponsored by the [[National Urban League]]. She photographed for the [[Poor People's Campaign]] in 1968 and contributed photos to ''The New Movement: Power for the Powerless''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Power for the Powerless, inc | author2=Kerpen, Karen, (ed.) | title=The new movement : power for the powerless | publication-date=1968 | publisher=New York | edition=[1st ed.] | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/21070246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 the Feinberg Law was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and Grossman led a group of teachers to seek reinstatement, but it was not until 1972 that they successfully sued to regain their jobs. In the meantime, during 1971 Grossman worked between [[Freelancer|freelance]] photography, social work and teaching photography, before finally, at age 58, returning after 21 years to her secondary teaching post at [[Norman Thomas High School|Central Commercial High School]] in 1974-75, her hard-won campaign against laws obstructing academic freedom vindicated. Even in her sixties, she fought for others as head of the [[Tenants' Union|tenant union]] in her building.&lt;ref&gt;[https://library.umbc.edu/speccoll/findingaids/coll006 Mildred Grossman papers at the Albin O. Kuhn Library &amp; Gallery of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development''' ('''MoFPED''') is a [[Cabinet of Uganda|cabinet]]-level government ministry of [[Uganda]]. Its mandate is to formulate sound economic and fiscal policies, mobilize resources for the implementation of government programmes, disburse public resources as appropriated by [[Parliament of Uganda|Parliament]], and account for their use in accordance with national laws and international best practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.finance.go.ug/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14&amp;Itemid=14 |date=6 October 2016 |accessdate=6 October 2016 | publisher=Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED) | author = Keith Muhakanizi | location=Kampala | title=Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development: Welcome Message}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cabinet minister of finance is [[Matia Kasaija]].&lt;ref name="New"&gt;{{cite web | newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]] | date=6 June 2016| location=Kampala | author=Uganda State House| url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/blob/view/-/3235304/data/1345443/-/3o16hn/-/Museveni%2527s+cabinet.pdf | title=Museveni's new cabinet list At 6 June 2016 | accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; MoFPED was created by the 1995 [[Constitution of Uganda]] and derives its power from the Constitution and related acts of [[Parliament of Uganda|parliament]], including the 2001 Budget Act and the 2003 Public Finance and Accountability Act.

== History ==

MoFPED was created by the 1995 [[Constitution of Uganda]], at the time, there were two departments: a Ministry of Finance (MoF) and a Ministry of Planning and Economic Development (MPED). By 1995, the government launched the Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) in order to prioritise poverty eradication. was formulated after a long consultative process with a wide range of stakeholders. The process was spearheaded by MPED.&lt;ref name="oecd"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Florence Kuteesa|author2=Ishmael Magona|author3=Maris Wanyera|author4=James Wokadala|title=Uganda: A Decade of Budget Reform and Poverty Reduction|journal=OECD Journal on Budgeting|date=2006|volume=6|issue=2|issn=1608-7143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the MoF and MPED were merged into the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development (MoFPED), which the [[World Bank]] noted was "critical in establishing fiscal discipline, while building links between policy formulation, planning, and budgeting".&lt;ref name="world bank"&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond the Annual Budget: Global Experience with Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-8213-9627-8|pages=231–241|date = 2013 | url= https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/11971/735140PUB0Annu00801200date010031012.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger led to an emphasis on coordinating the budget process and introducing output-oriented budgeting within a medium-term expenditure framework.&lt;ref name="imfblog"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kuteesa|first1=Florence|title=Budget Reforms in Uganda: From Vision to Reality - A Personal Account|url=http://blog-pfm.imf.org/pfmblog/2010/09/budget-reforms-in-uganda-from-vision-to-reality-a-personal-account.html|accessdate=11 February 2018|work=Public Financial Management Blog|publisher=IMF|date=1 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these early reforms had a "cutting-edge dimension"; Uganda was one of the first countries in Africa to adopt a semi-autonomous revenue agency (the [[Uganda Revenue Authority]]) as well as introduce medium-term budgeting. Implementation, however, had a lot of room for improvement.&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Matt Andrews|author2=Lawrence Bategeka|title=Overcoming the Limits of Institutional Reform in Uganda|date=October 2013|publisher=Harvard Center for International Development and UNU World Institute for Development Economics Research|isbn=978-92-9230-688-5|url=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/centers/cid/files/publications/faculty-working-papers/269_Andrews_Uganda.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, MoFPED started receiving detailed project-by-project reports on budget allocations and quarterly expenditures from local governments through a digital budget reporting tool. However, local stakeholders, including elected representatives whose mandate it is to monitor service provision, are largely unaware of this information. In order to solve this issue, MoFPED partnered with [[Innovations for Poverty Action]] (IPA), the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI), and [[Advocates Coalition for Development and Environment]] (ACODE) in 2014 to launch a Budget Transparency Initiative to make department, project-, and location-specific budget information available to politicians, opinion leaders, and the public as well as mobilize them to monitor and provide feedback on the spending and services provided by government institutions.&lt;ref name="ipastudy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raffler|first1=Pia|title=Budget Transparency and Political Oversight in Uganda|url=https://www.poverty-action.org/study/budget-transparency-and-political-oversight-uganda|website=Innovations for Poverty Action|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large purple peninsula in the southwest is the Morea, at the time the Empire's most important and prosperous territory]]
[[File:Peloponnese Middle Ages map-en.svg|thumb|right|280px|Map of the Morea in the Middle Ages]]

The '''Morea revolt of 1453–1454''' was a failed [[peasant]] rebellion carried out against the rule of the brothers [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos]], rulers of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Despotate of the Morea]] in the [[Peloponnese]] peninsula.

==Background==
{{see|Byzantium under the Palaiologoi}}
The Byzantine Empire had ruled over the Morea for centuries before the rebellion. During this time, several thousand [[Arvanites]] had settled in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrogorsky, p. 508&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Battle of Varna]] in 1444, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] had a free hand in dealing with the remnants of the Byzantine Empire, which had been in decline for over a century. In 1446, the Ottomans invaded the Byzantine Morea which was then jointly administrated by the two brothers, the [[Despot (court title)|Despots]] [[Constantine XI Palaiologos|Constantine]] and [[Thomas Palaiologos]]. The brothers successfully resisted the invasion, but at the cost of devastating the countryside of the Morea, and the Turks carrying off 60,000 Greek civilians back to their territory.&lt;ref&gt;Cheetham, pp. 215-216&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murad II]], the Ottoman [[Sultan]], concluded a peace treaty which resulted in the brothers paying a heavy [[tribute]] to the Turks, accepting [[vassalage]] to them and a promise not to oppose them in the future, for Murad had to deal with his own internal conflicts elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Ostrogorsky, p. 567&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the death of Byzantine Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]] in [[Constantinople]] in October 1448, the imperial throne fell to Constantine, who was crowned on 6 January 1449 in [[Mystras]] before departing for the capital. Two months later, he assumed his new role in Constantinople as Emperor Constantine XI. His younger brothers, Thomas and Demetrius remained in charge of the Morea as joint Despots in his place. Despite assurances to Constantine that they would pledge support to one another, both Thomas and Demetrius coveted the other's lands – in addition, they pressed claims against [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] port possessions in the Morea, alienating the only power capable of aiding them in resisting the Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Cheetham, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; The mutual hostility went to the point that both despots requested military aid from the Turks against the other. During the final [[Fall of Constantinople|siege of Constantinople]], the new Sultan, [[Mehmed II]] invaded the Morea again as a distraction to prevent the brothers sending any provisions to Constantinople.

==The revolt==
Shortly after the fall of Constantinople and the death of the last Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI, 30,000 Albanians under [[Peter Bua]] rose in revolt against the two brothers, Thomas and Demetrius II, due to the chronic insecurity and tribute payment to the Turks.&lt;ref name="C1"&gt;Cheetham, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; The Albanians were later joined by the local Greeks, who by then had a common leader in [[Manuel Kantakouzenos (Morea)|Manuel Kantakouzenos]]. Kantakouzenos was hailed as their common Despot, and the rebels asked for Venetian help, while the two brothers asked for Mehmed's help in putting down the rebellion. The situation was further confused by a second rebellion led by [[Giovanni Asen Zaccaria]], the son of the last [[Prince of Achaea]] [[Centurione II Zaccaria]], who claimed his father's title representing the remains of the [[Latinokratia|Latin]] element in the Morea. Before the rebellion, Zaccaria had been imprisoned by Thomas but managed to escape during the confusion.&lt;ref name="C1" /&gt;

As the Sultan's vassals, the despots called upon Turkish aid, and Omar, the son of the Ottoman governor of Thessaly [[Turakhan Beg]] arrived in December 1453. After scoring a victory against the rebels, he departed, having secured the release of his brother Ahmed, who had been captured by the Byzantines in 1446. The revolt did not subside however, and in October 1454 Turakhan himself was forced to intervene. After sacking a few fortresses, the rebellious populace capitulated. Turakhan advised the two Palaiologoi to settle their differences and rule well, and then departed the peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Nicol (1993), p. 3961&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Setton (1978), pp. 146, 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; Tribute was reinstated to the same levels and the Despots were to continue their vassalage as before. As for the rebel leaders, Boua was pardoned by Mehmet and later became a spokesperson for the Albanian people, Zaccaria fled and ended up as a pensioner in Venice and later the Papal Court, while Kantakouzenos escaped and disappeared from history.&lt;ref name="C1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8569">The National Security Strategy of the United Kingdom sets out the risks that UK faces and how the government of that day will address such risks.

==List of known National Security Strategy Papers presented==

===National Security Strategy 2008===

The [[UK government]]'s first '''National Security Strategy''', 'The National Security Strategy of the United Kingdom: Security in an interdependent world', was released by the [[Cabinet Office]] in March 2008 under the Labour Party-led Government. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228539/7291.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Security Strategy 2009===
The 2008 Paper was updated in 2009, under the heading 'Security for the Next Generation'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/229001/7590.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Security Strategy 2010===

The [[UK government]]'s second National Security Strategy was published in October 2010 under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Government. It is titled "A Strong Britain in an Age of Uncertainty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/news/topstorynews/2010/10/national-security-strategy-55815
|accessdate=2010-10-20
|title=National Security Strategy |publisher = Number10.gov.uk
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It outlines threats facing the [[United Kingdom]], and defences against these threats. It emphasises the risks posed by [[terrorism]], [[cyberwarfare]], international military crises, and natural disasters.

====2011 Update to the National Security Strategy 2010====

The National Security Strategy promised an "annual report of progress on implementation" of the National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review.&lt;ref&gt;NSS, paras 0.12, 4.12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual progress report was eventually published in December 2011 as ''The Strategic Defence and Security Review: First Annual Report''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/229499/111208_First_Annual_Report_SDSR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It focuses on the Government implementation of the SDSR, for example progress in reducing defence capabilities and bringing troops back from Germany.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; There is some coverage of recent events, for example the conflict Libya, work in Afghanistan and the deaths of Osama Bin Laden and Anwar Al Awlaki.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;	It also looks at domestic issues such as the new CONTEST and Prevent strategies, and security for the Olympics.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;	It reports on developments in the FCO network and the DFID aid programme and there is also an update on the UK’s alliances.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

However the Joint Committee criticised the document for being "almost unrelentingly positive".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy First review of the National Security Strategy 2010 First Report of Session 2010–12 p24&lt;/ref&gt;
It noted that it contains no details on areas where there have been delays or problems, even where those have been very high profile and that it contained no lessons learned, not even those already set out in other government papers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

====2012 Update to the National Security Strategy 2010====

In December 2012 the Government published the 2012 update titled Annual report on the National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review. The 2012 Update was over twice as long as the 2011 version and covered a much wider range of topics than the 2011 report, including details on the NSS, the SDSR and a range of security threats and challenges facing the UK.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/83775/121128-Annual-Report-to-Parliament-on-NSS-and-SDSR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy published a press release in which the Chair of the Committee said:

"We welcome this year's Annual report on the National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review which is much broader and more wide-ranging than last year's report. However we regret the fact that it is not yet as complete, transparent, and strategic as it could be. We hope the Government will take the opportunity in next year's report to focus more on the strategic aspects of events; for example this year's report ignores the strategic impact of the Eurozone crisis. It also glosses over other problems the Government has encountered this year. Omitting altogether difficulties such as the numerous problems there have been with Border Security in the last year fools no-one."{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015===

The UK presented its third NSS in November 2015 under the Conservative-led government. It combined it with its Strategic Defence and Security Review to form a single policy [[Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015|white paper]]. It is titled "A Secure and Prosperous United Kingdom".

==Response to the 2010 NSS: Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy ==
{{main|Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy}}

The '''Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy''' was formed to respond to the 2010 NSS. This committee "brings together 22 members of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords (including the chairs of the relevant Commons departmental select committees) to consider the  2010 National Security Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/role/&lt;/ref&gt; It has the terms of reference are "to consider the National Security Strategy".&lt;ref&gt;Standing Orders of the House of Commons Public Business 2011, SO No 152I and HL Deb, 6 December 2010, Col 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee comprises 12 members from the [[House of Commons (United Kingdom)|House of Commons]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmstords/539/539.pdf Standing Orders of the House of Commons for Public Business (April 2010) §152I]&lt;/ref&gt; and 10 members of the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-archive/jcnss/ Committee Home Page (archive)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee published its first report ''First review of the National Security Strategy 2010'' on 8 March 2012. The report addresses the National Security Strategy, the National Security Council (and the secretariat which supports it), and the National Security Adviser. It was agreed unanimously.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy First review of the National Security Strategy 2010 First Report of Session 2010–12 p43&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee welcomed the National Security Strategy but said that it was work in progress and needed to be improved.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy First review of the National Security Strategy 2010 First Report of Session 2010–12 p3&lt;/ref&gt; In a press release sent out with the report it said that:

*There is no evidence that the NSS has influenced decisions made since the Strategic Defence and Security Review. If the current strategy is not guiding choices then it needs to be revised.
*There should be an "overarching strategy", a document designed to guide government decision-making and crisis management both at home and on the international stage.
*The Government’s assertion that there will be no reduction in the UK's influence on the world stage is "wholly unrealistic in the medium to long term" and the UK needs to plan for a changing, and more partnership-dependent, role in the world.&lt;ref name="parliament.uk"&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/national-security-strategy/news/publication-of-report1/&lt;/ref&gt;

It also said that the Government's unwillingness to provide it with all the information it had asked for about the National Security Risk Assessment means that it was unable to give Parliament any assurances about its adequacy.&lt;ref name="parliament.uk"/&gt;

'''One Iowa''' is a statewide LGBTQ advocacy organization in [[Iowa]]. The organization works to preserve and advance equality for LGBTQ individuals in Iowa through advocacy, grassroots efforts, and education. It was instrumental in the [[Iowa Supreme Court|state's Supreme Court]] ruling to overturn the ban on [[same-sex marriage]].

==Background==
The organization was founded in November 2006 following the 2005 suit filed by [[Lambda Legal]] that led to the ''[[Varnum v. Brien]]'' suit.&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/04/15/iowa/ |first=Jodi |last=Mardesich |title=Gay marriage in the Heartland|publisher=Salon |date=2009-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, the emphasis of the group was marriage equality, but soon after formation, a board of directors was established and efforts were increased to include [[civil rights]], [[civil marriage]], LGBTQ families and aging.

The organization is a member of the [[Equality Federation]].&lt;ref name="eqfed-members"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://equalityfederation.org/members | title=Member Organizations | work=Equality Federation | accessdate=January 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efforts==
The organization has used the Internet and other grassroots methods to spread its message. It established a [[Facebook]] page, a [[Twitter]] page, and has a website at www.oneiowa.org. During ''Varnum'', the group contacted residents and urged them to contact their local officials. They also held forums in towns throughout Iowa that included LGBT community members, individuals from the religious establishment and legal scholars, where they emphasized the need for marriage equality.&lt;ref name="salon"/&gt;

Following ''Varnum'', the group was lauded for its grassroots efforts by the [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glaad.org/Page.aspx?pid=513
|first=Richard |last=Ferraro |title=GLAAD Applauds Iowa Supreme Court Ruling on Marriage |publisher=GLAAD |date=2009-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the group's efforts also faced criticism. Congressman [[Steve King]] (R-IA) remarked that the state would become "a gay-marriage mecca" following the court's decision. But a One Iowa spokesman maintained that the group's efforts concerned "Iowa couples" and that it was not his intention to turn the state into a "sideshow."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2009-04-22/news/iowa-or-bust-dozen-st-louis-gay-couples-soon-head-to-hawkeye-state-get-hitched-sort-of/
|first=Keegan |last=Hamilton |title=Iowa or Bust: Fourteen gay couples from St. Louis will soon head to the Hawkeye State to get hitched. Well, sort of.|publisher=St. Louis News |date=2009-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has since worked to educate court recorders on how to "make sure gays and lesbian couples feel welcomed" when applying for a [[marriage license]], and have allowed for participants to choose from "bride," "groom" or "spouse" on the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washblade.com/2009/4-24/news/national/14429.cfm |first=Chris |last=Johnson |title=Iowa’s same-sex couples prepare to get married |publisher=Washington Blade |date=2009-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In coalition with its ally groups, One Iowa's achievements following ''Varnum'' also include defeating anti-marriage policies, modernizing Iowa’s HIV transmission law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/tonymerevick/iowa-legislature-passes-bill-reforming-draconian-hiv-transmi |first=Tyler |last=Merevick |title=Iowa Legislature Passes Bill Reforming "Draconian" HIV Transmission Law |publisher=BuzzFeed |date=2014-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; urging Iowa Senators to stop blocking judicial nominees at the federal level, civil rights advocacy to protect the LGBT community against employment and housing discrimination, and establishing anti-bullying policies in Iowa’s schools.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

One Iowa's work also includes educating Iowans about why marriage matters to gay and lesbian couples, ensuring that communities are safe for LGBTQ youth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iowapridenetwork.org | title=Iowa Pride Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching out to communities of faith, addressing concerns about Iowa’s aging and elder LGBT populations, and improving access to resources for transgender Iowans.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28331">The '''Pigou Club''' is described by its creator, economist [[Greg Mankiw]], as "an elite group of [[economist]]s and [[pundit (politics)|pundits]] with the good sense to have publicly advocated higher [[Pigovian tax]]es, such as [[fuel tax|gasoline taxes]] or [[carbon tax]]es."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | last = Mankiw | first = Greg | title =  Al Gore in the Pigou Club | date = June 24, 2006
  | url = http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/06/al-gore-in-pigou-club.html}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

These pundits and economists often advocate lowering other taxes to keep the total amount of taxes collected the same, though many have also proposed dedicating the revenue to other worthwhile projects. A Pigovian tax (also spelled Pigouvian tax, named after economist [[Arthur Cecil Pigou]]) is a [[tax]] levied to correct the [[negative externalities]] (negative side-effects) of a [[Market (economics)|market]] activity. These ideas are also known as an [[Ecotax]] (or green [[tax shift]]).

'''''Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun''''' is a phrase which was coined by Chinese communist leader [[Mao Zedong]].  The phrase was originally used by Mao during an emergency meeting of the [[Communist Party of China]] on 7 August 1927, at the beginning of the [[Chinese Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A glossary of political terms of the People's Republic of China |url=https://books.google.com/?id=J5QbQpQTegwC&amp;pg=PA325#c_top |edition=illustrated |page=325 |editor-first=Gucheng |editor-last=Li |publisher=Chinese University Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-9622016156}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mao employed the phrase a second time on 6 November 1938, during his concluding speech at the sixth [[Plenary session|Plenary Session]] of the CPC's [[6th_Central_Committee_of_the_Communist_Party_of_China|sixth Central Committee]]; again, the speech was concerned with the Civil War, and now also with [[World War II]].  A portion of the 1938 speech was excerpted and included in Mao's ''Selected Works'', with the title "Problems of War and Strategy".  Finally in 1964, the central phrase was reproduced again and popularized as an early quotation in Mao's ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mao |first=Zedong |title=Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung |page=61 |publisher=[[Foreign Languages Press]] |location=Peking |date=1972 |isbn=9780835123884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sixth plenary session==

The 1938 paragraph containing the phrase is reproduced below; the central phrase (in bold), cited as deriving from the 1938 speech via the ''Selected Works'', is that given in Mao's ''Quotations''.

{{quotation|[[Communist]]s do not fight for personal [[military]] power (they must in no circumstances do that, and let no one ever again follow the example of [[Chang Kuo-tao]]), but they must fight for military power for the [[Communist Party|Party]], for military power for the people. As a national war of resistance is going on, we must also fight for military power for the nation. Where there is naivete on the question of military power, nothing whatsoever can be achieved. It is very difficult for the [[Working_class#Marxist_definition|labouring people]], who have been deceived and intimidated by the reactionary [[ruling class|ruling classes]] for thousands of years, to awaken to the importance of having guns in their own hands. Now that Japanese [[imperialist]] oppression and the nation-wide resistance to it have pushed our labouring people into the arena of war, Communists should prove themselves the most politically conscious leaders in this war. '''Every Communist must grasp the truth, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."''' Our principle is that the Party commands the gun, and the gun must never be allowed to command the Party. Yet, having guns, we can create Party organizations, as witness the powerful Party organizations which the [[Eighth Route Army]] has created in northern China. We can also create cadres, create schools, create culture, create mass movements. Everything in [[Yenan]] has been created by having guns. All things grow out of the barrel of a gun. According to the [[Marx's theory of the state|Marxist theory of the state]], the army is the chief component of [[State (polity)|state]] power. Whoever wants to seize and retain state power must have a strong [[army]]. Some people ridicule us as advocates of the "omnipotence of war". Yes, we are advocates of the omnipotence of revolutionary war; that is good, not bad, it is [[Marxism|Marxist]]. The guns of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Communist Party]] created [[socialism]]. We shall create a democratic republic. Experience in the [[class struggle]] in the era of [[imperialism]] teaches us that it is only by the power of the gun that the working class and the labouring masses can defeat the armed [[bourgeoisie]] and [[landlord|landlords]]; in this sense we may say that only with guns can the whole world be transformed. We are advocates of the abolition of war, we do not want war; but war can only be abolished through war, and in order to get rid of the gun it is necessary to take up the gun.| Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Vol. II, pp. 224-225&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung: Vol. II |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-2/ |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] (transcription by the Maoist Documentation Project) |accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Technique==
The sample ([[fruit]]s, [[vegetable]]s, [[tobacco]], etc.) is homogenized and centrifuged with a reagent and agitated for 1 minute. The reagents used depend on the type of sample to be analyzed. Following this, the sample is put through a dispersive solid phase extraction cleanup prior to analysis by [[gas-liquid chromatography]] or [[liquid-liquid chromatography]].

Samples prepared using the QuEChERS method can be processed more quickly using a homogenization instrument.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Such instruments can homogenize the food sample in a centrifuge tube, then agitate the sample with the reagent of choice, before moving the extracted sample for centrifuging. By using such an instrument, the samples can be moved through the QuEChERS method more quickly.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Some modifications to the original QuEChERS method had to be introduced to ensure efficient extraction of pH-dependent compounds (e.g., phenoxyalkanoic acids), to minimize degradation of susceptible compounds (e.g., base and acid labile pesticides) and to expand the spectrum of matrices covered.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Applications==
The QuEChERS method has been readily accepted by many pesticide residue analysts.&lt;ref name="pmid17909760"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Payá P, Anastassiades M, Mack D, etal |title=Analysis of pesticide residues using the Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) pesticide multiresidue method in combination with gas and liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometric detection |journal=[[Anal Bioanal Chem]] |volume=389 |issue=6 |pages=1697–714 |date=November 2007 |pmid=17909760 |doi=10.1007/s00216-007-1610-7 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chromatographyonline.com/novel-sample-preparation-approach-increase-throughput-pesticide-analysis-lc-ms-ms A Novel Sample Preparation Approach to Increase the Throughput of Pesticide Analysis by LC–MS-MS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807044526/http://chromatographyonline.findanalytichem.com/lcgc/Hyphenated/A-Novel-Sample-Preparation-Approach-to-Increase-th/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/613593 |date=August 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Queer anarchism''' (or '''anarcha-queer''') is an [[Anarchist schools of thought|anarchist school of thought]] that advocates [[anarchism]] and [[social revolution]] as a means of [[gay liberation|queer liberation]] and abolition of [[homophobia]], [[lesbophobia]], [[transmisogyny]], [[biphobia]], [[transphobia]], [[heteronormativity]], [[heterosexism]], [[patriarchy]] and the [[gender binary]].

== History ==
[[File:John Henry Mackay.gif|thumb|140px|[[John Henry Mackay]], German [[individualist anarchist]] advocate of [[LGBT rights]]]]
Anarchism's foregrounding of individual freedoms made for a natural defense of homosexuality in the eyes of many, both inside and outside of the anarchist movement. In ''{{lang|de|Das Kuriositäten-Kabinett}}'' (1923), Emil Szittya wrote about homosexuality that "very many anarchists have this tendency. Thus I found in Paris a Hungarian anarchist, Alexander Sommi, who founded a homosexual anarchist group on the basis of this idea". His view is confirmed by [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] in his 1914 book ''{{lang|de|Die Homosexualität des Mannes und des Weibes}}'': "In the ranks of a relatively small party, the anarchist, it seemed to me as if proportionately more homosexuals and effeminates are found than in others".&lt;ref&gt;[[Magnus Hirschfeld|Hirschfeld, Magnus]], 1914. ''Die Homosexualität des Mannes und des  Weibes'' (Berlin: Louis Marcus)&lt;/ref&gt; Italian anarchist [[Luigi Bertoni]] (who Szittya also believed to be homosexual) observed: "Anarchists demand freedom in everything, thus also in sexuality. Homosexuality leads to a healthy sense of [[Philosophy of Max Stirner|egoism]], for which every anarchist should strive".

In [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'', he passionately advocates for an [[egalitarian]] society where wealth is shared by all while warning of the dangers of [[authoritarian socialism]] that would crush individuality.&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary1"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Kristian_Williams__The_Soul_of_Man_Under..._Anarchism_.html Kristian Williams. "The Soul of Man Under... Anarchism?"]&lt;/ref&gt; He later commented: "I think I am rather more than a Socialist. I am something of an Anarchist, I believe".&lt;ref&gt;According to his biographer Neil McKenna, Wilde was part of a secret organization that aimed to legalize homosexuality, and was known among the group as a leader of "the Cause". (McKenna, Neil. 2003. ''The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde''.)&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1894, Wilde wrote to his lover Lord Alfred Douglas to tell of "a dangerous adventure". He had gone out sailing with two lovely boys—Stephen and Alphonso—and they were caught in a storm. "We took five hours in an awful gale to come back! [And we] did not reach pier till eleven o’clock at night, pitch dark all the way, and a fearful sea. [...] All the fishermen were waiting for us". Tired, cold and "wet to the skin", the three men immediately "flew to the hotel for hot brandy and water", but there was a problem as the law stood in the way: "As it was past ten o’clock on a Sunday night the proprietor could not sell us any brandy or spirits of any kind! So he had to give it to us. The result was not displeasing, but what laws!". Wilde finishes the story: "Both Alphonso and Stephen are now anarchists, I need hardly say".&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary1"/&gt;

[[File:Adolf Brand ca. 1930.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Adolf Brand]], early German anarchist activist for the rights of male homosexuals]]
[[Anarcho-syndicalism|Anarcho-syndicalist]] writer Ulrich Linse wrote about "a sharply outlined figure of the Berlin individualist anarchist cultural scene around 1900", the "precocious [[Johannes Holzmann]]" (known as [https://web.archive.org/web/20110604010355/http://libcom.org/history/articles/1882-1914-senna-hoy/index.php Senna Hoy]): "an adherent of free love, [Hoy] celebrated homosexuality as a 'champion of culture' and engaged in the struggle against [[Paragraph 175]]".&lt;ref&gt;Linse, Ulrich, ''Individualanarchisten, Syndikalisten, Bohémiens,'' in "Berlin um 1900", ed. Gelsine Asmus (Berlin: Berlinische Galerie, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; The young Hoy (born 1882) published these views in his weekly magazine {{lang|de|Kampf}} (''Struggle'') from 1904, which reached a circulation of 10,000 the following year. German anarchist [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapist]] [[Otto Gross]] also wrote extensively about same-sex sexuality in both men and women and argued against its discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Heuer. [http://www.ottogross.org/english/documents/BiographicalSurvey.html "Otto Gross (1877-1920) - Biographical Survey"].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heterosexual]] anarchist [[Robert Reitzel]] (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his German-language journal ''[[Der arme Teufel]]'' (Detroit).

[[John Henry Mackay]] was an individualist anarchist known in the anarchist movement as an important early follower and propagandizer of the philosophy of [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50614F7395A15738DDDA90A94DC405B878CF1D3 "IDEAS OF MAX STIRNER.; First English Translation of His Book, "The Ego and His Own" -- His Attack on Socialism -- The Most Revolutionary Book Ever Published." by JAMES HUNEKER]&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside this, Mackay was also an early signer of (Magnus) Hirschfeld's "Petition to the Legislative Bodies of the German Empire" for "a revision of the anti-homosexual paragraph 175 (his name appeared in the first list published in 1899)".&lt;ref name="williamapercy12"&gt;[http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/images/Hubert_kennedy.pdf Hubert Kennedy. ''Anarchist Of Love: The Secret Life Of John Henry Mackay.''pg. 12]&lt;/ref&gt; He also kept a special interest about Oscar Wilde and was outraged at his imprisonment for homosexual activity.&lt;ref name="williamapercy12"/&gt; Nevertheless, Mackay entered into conflict with Hirschfeld and his organization the Scientific Humanitarian Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/images/Hubert_kennedy.pdf Hubert Kennedy. ''Anarchist Of Love: The Secret Life Of John Henry Mackay.''pg. 8]&lt;/ref&gt;

The individualist anarchist [[Adolf Brand]] was originally a member of Hirschfeld's Scientific Humanitarian Committee, but formed a break-away group. Brand and his colleagues, known as the ''Gemeinschaft der Eigenen'' ("Community of [[Self-ownership|Self-owners]]"), were also heavily influenced by the writings of Stirner.&lt;ref name="williamapercy7"/&gt; [[File:Der Eigene - 1896.jpg|right|thumb|140px|''[[Der Eigene]]'' [[Max Stirner|stirnerist]] pioneer Gay activist publication]]They were opposed to Hirschfeld's medical characterization of homosexuality as the domain of an "intermediate sex".&lt;ref&gt;New York: Howard Fertig, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Ewald Tschek, another homosexual anarchist writer of the era, regularly contributed to Adolf Brand's journal ''{{lang|de|[[Der Eigene]]}}'' and wrote in 1925 that Hirschfeld's Scientific Humanitarian Committee was a danger to the German people, caricaturing Hirschfeld as "Dr. Feldhirsch". Although Mackay was closer in views to Brand and his "Community of Self-owners" in some respects as compared to Hirschfeld's Scientific Humanitarian Committee, nevertheless he did not agree with Brand's antifeminism and almost misogynistic views believing his "anarchist principle of equal freedom to all certainly applied to women as well as men".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.williamapercy.com/wiki/images/Hubert_kennedy.pdf Hubert Kennedy. ''Anarchist Of Love: The Secret Life Of John Henry Mackay.''pg. 35]&lt;/ref&gt;

''{{lang|de|[[Der Eigene]]}}'' was the first [[gay]] journal in the world, published from 1896 to 1932 by Brand in Berlin. Brand contributed many poems and articles himself. Other contributors included [[Benedict Friedlaender]], [[Hanns Heinz Ewers]], [[Erich Mühsam]], [[Kurt Hiller]], [[Ernst Burchard]], John Henry Mackay, [[Theodor Lessing]], [[Klaus Mann]] and [[Thomas Mann]] as well as artists [[Wilhelm von Gloeden]], [[Fidus]] and [[Sascha Schneider]]. After the rise to power by the Nazis, Brand became a victim of persecution and had his journal closed.

The prominent American anarchist [[Emma Goldman]] was also an outspoken critic of [[homophobia|prejudice against homosexuals]]. Her belief that social liberation should extend to gay men and lesbians was virtually unheard of at the time, even among anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Katz|first=Jonathan Ned|authorlink=Jonathan Ned Katz|title=[[Gay American History: Lesbians and Gay Men in the U.S.A.]]|year=1992|location=New York City|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=376–380}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] wrote, "she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public".&lt;ref name="hirschfeld"&gt;Goldman, Emma (1923). "Offener Brief an den Herausgeber der Jahrbücher über Louise Michel" with a preface by Magnus Hirschfeld. ''Jahrbuch für sexuelle Zwischenstufen'' 23: 70. Translated from German by James Steakley. Goldman's original letter in English is not known to be extant.&lt;/ref&gt; In numerous speeches and letters, she defended the right of gay men and lesbians to love as they pleased and condemned the fear and stigma associated with homosexuality. As Goldman wrote in a letter to Hirschfeld: "It is a tragedy, I feel, that people of a different sexual type are caught in a world which shows so little understanding for homosexuals and is so crassly indifferent to the various gradations and variations of gender and their great significance in life".&lt;ref name="hirschfeld"/&gt;

Despite these supportive stances, the anarchist movement of the time certainly was not free of homophobia and an editorial in an influential Spanish anarchist journal from 1935 argued that an anarchist should not even associate with homosexuals, let alone be one: "If you are an anarchist, that means that you are more morally upright and physically strong than the average man. And he who likes inverts is no real man, and is therefore no real anarchist".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Cleminson, Richard. 1995. ''Male inverts and homosexuals: Sex discourse in the Anarchist Revista Blanca'', Published in Gert Hekma et al. (eds.)"Gay men and the sexual history of the political left" by Harrington Park Press 1995, {{ISBN|978-1-56023-067-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]] was a main founder of the Spanish [[anarcha-feminist]] federation [[Mujeres Libres]] who was open about her [[lesbian]]ism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wzar.unizar.es/siem/articulos/Premios/MujeresLibres.pdf "basta pensar en el lesbianismo de Lucía Sánchez Saornil"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402065947/http://wzar.unizar.es/siem/articulos/Premios/MujeresLibres.pdf|date=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a young age, she began writing poetry and associated herself with the emerging [[Ultraist movement|Ultraist]] literary movement. By 1919, she had been published in a variety of journals, including ''Los Quijotes'', ''Tableros'', ''Plural'', ''Manantial'' and ''La Gaceta Literaria''. Working under a male [[pen name]], she was able to explore [[lesbian]] themes&lt;ref&gt;"R. Fue una época transgresora, emergió el feminismo y la libertad sexual estuvo en el candelero. Hay rastreos de muchas lesbianas escritoras: Carmen Conde[primera académica de número], Victorina Durán, Margarita Xirgu, Ana María Sagi, la periodista Irene Polo, Lucía Sánchez Saornil, fundadora de Mujeres Libres[sección feminista de CNT]... Incluso existía un círculo sáfico en Madrid como lugar de encuentro y tertulia.P. ¿Se declaraban lesbianas?R. Había quien no se escondía mucho, como Polo o Durán, pero lesbiana era un insulto, algo innombrable. Excepto los poemas homosexuales de Sánchez Saornil, sus textos no eran explícitos para poder publicarlos, así que hay que reinterpretarlos."[http://elpais.com/diario/2007/12/06/paisvasco/1196973608_850215.html "Tener referentes serios de lesbianas elimina estereotipos" by Juan Fernandez at ''El Pais'']&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to [[censorship]] and punishment. Dissatisfied with the chauvinistic prejudices of fellow [[Second Spanish Republic|Republicans]], Lucía Sánchez Saornil joined with two ''compañeras'', [[Mercedes Comaposada]] and [[Amparo Poch y Gascón]], to form [[Mujeres Libres]] in 1936. Mujeres Libres was an [[autonomous]] anarchist organization for women committed to a "double struggle" of [[women's liberation]] and social revolution. Lucía and other "Free Women" rejected the dominant view that gender equality would emerge naturally from a [[classless society]]. As the Spanish Civil War exploded, Mujeres Libres quickly grew to 30,000 members, organizing women's social spaces, schools, newspapers and daycare programs.

The writings of the French [[bisexual]] anarchist [[Daniel Guérin]] offer an insight into the tension sexual minorities among the left have often felt. He was a leading figure in the French left from the 1930s until his death in 1988. After [[coming out]] in 1965, he spoke about the extreme hostility toward homosexuality that permeated the left throughout much of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;*The [[Parti Communiste Français]] was "hysterically intransigent as far as ’moral behaviour’ was concerned" (''Aragon, victime et profiteur du tabou'', in ''Gai Pied Hebdo'', 4 June 1983, reproduced in ''Homosexualité et Révolution'', pp. 62-3, quote p. 63.);&lt;br&gt;* The trotskyist [[Pierre Lambert]]'s OCI was "completely hysterical with regard to homosexuality"; [[Workers' Struggle|Lutte ouvrire]] was theoretically opposed to homosexuality; as was the [[Communist League|Ligue communiste]], despite their belatedly paying lip service to gay lib. (''à confesse'', Interview with Gérard Ponthieu in Sexpol no. 1 (20 January 1975), pp.10-14.)&lt;br /&gt;* Together, Guérin argued, such groups bore a great deal of responsibility for fostering homophobic attitudes among the working class as late as the 1970s. Their attitude was "the most blinkered, the most reactionary, the most antiscientific". (''Etre homosexuel et révolutionnaire'', La Quinzaine littéraire, no. 215, no. spécial : ‘Les homosexualités’ (August 1975), pp. 9-10. Quote p. 10)&lt;/ref&gt; "Not so many years ago, to declare oneself a revolutionary and to confess to being homosexual were incompatible", Guérin wrote in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Guérin|Guérin, Daniel]]. 1975. ''Etre homosexuel et révolutionnaire'', La Quinzaine littéraire, no. 215, no. spécial : ‘Les homosexualités’ (August 1975), pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, Guérin was widely attacked for his study of the [[Kinsey Reports]] in which he also detailed the oppression of homosexuals in France: "The harshest [criticisms] came from marxists, who tend seriously to underestimate the form of oppression which is antisexual terrorism. I expected it, of course, and I knew that in publishing my book I was running the risk of being attacked by those to whom I feel closest on a political level".&lt;ref&gt;Letter of 27 May 1955, Fonds Guérin, BDIC, F° Δ 721/carton 12/4, quoted in Chaperon, ‘Le fonds Daniel Guérin et l’histoire de la sexualité’ in Journal de la BDIC, no.5 (June 2002), p.10&lt;/ref&gt; After coming out publicly in 1965, Guérin was abandoned by the left and his papers on sexual liberation were censored or refused publication in left-wing journals.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David. 2003. ''For a dialectic of homosexuality and revolution.'' Paper for "Conference on "Socialism and Sexuality. Past and present of radical sexual politics", Amsterdam, 3–4 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1950s, Guérin moved away from [[Marxism–Leninism]] and toward a synthesis of anarchism and [[Marxism]] close to [[platformism]], which allowed for individualism while rejecting capitalism. Guérin was involved in the uprising of May 1968 and was a part of the French gay liberation movement that emerged after the events. Decades later, Frédéric Martel described Guérin as the "grandfather of the French homosexual movement".&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Martel, ''Le rose et le noir. Les homosexuels en France depuis 1968'' (Paris: Seuil, 2000), pp.46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile in the United States, the influential anarchist thinker [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]] came out late in his career as bisexual. The freedom with which he revealed in print and in public his romantic and sexual relations with men (notably in a late essay, "Being [[Queer]]"),&lt;ref name="stoehr"&gt;{{citation |title=Crazy Hope and Finite Experience: Final Essays of Paul Goodman |editor-first=Taylor |editor-last=Stoehr |url=https://books.google.com/?id=g1ce-yTHuWMC |first=Paul |last=Goodman |chapter=Being Queer |year=1994 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-88163-266-X |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved to be one of the many important cultural springboards for the emerging [[gay liberation]] movement of the early 1970s.

Anarcha-queer originated during the second half 20th century among anarchists involved in the gay liberation movement, who viewed anarchism as the road to harmony between [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]]/cis people and [[LGBT]] people. Anarcha-queer has its roots deep in [[queercore]], a form of [[punk rock]] that portrays homosexuality in a positive manner. Like most forms of punk rock, queercore attracts a large anarchist crowd. Anarchists are prominent in [[Queercore#Zines|queercore zines]]. There are two main anarcha-queer groups: [[Queer Mutiny]], a British group with branches in most major cities; and [[Bash Back!]], an American network of queer anarchists. Queer Fist appeared in [[New York City]] and identifies itself as "an anti-assimilationist, [[anti-capitalist]], [[anti-authoritarian]] street action group, came together to provide [[direct action]] and a radical queer and trans-identified voice at the Republican National Convention (RNC) protests".&lt;ref&gt;[http://queerfist.blogspot.com/ Queer Fist blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarcha-feminist collectives such as the Spanish squat [[Eskalera Karakola]] and the Bolivian [[Mujeres Creando]] give high importance to lesbian and bisexual female issues.

The [[Fag Army]] is a left-wing queer anarchist group in [[Sweden]], which launched its first action on August 18, 2014 when it [[Pieing|pied]] the [[Minister for Health and Social Affairs (Sweden)|Minister for Health and Social Affairs]], [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Christian Democrat]] leader [[Göran Hägglund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.se/20140818/christian-democrat-leader-gets-cake-in-face|title=Christian Democrat leader attacked with cake|date=18 August 2014|work=[[The Local]]|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Regional Somali Language Academy''' ('''RSLA''') is an intergovernmental regulating body for the [[Somali language]] in the [[Horn of Africa|Horn]] region. As of February 2015, it is based in [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti City]].

==Overview==
On 28 June 2013, the [[Government of Djibouti]], the [[Federal Government of Somalia]] and the [[Government of Ethiopia]] launched the Regional Somali Language Academy at a ceremony in Djibouti City. The event was organized by [[Djibouti]]'s Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Culture and Waqf in conjunction with the Somali-Speaking PEN Centre of Djibouti, and was attended by around 50 prominent Somali-speaking intellectuals from the region and elsewhere. Among the guests were [[Somalia]]'s Minister of Information, Posts and Telecommunications [[Abdullahi Elmoge Hersi]], the [[Somaliland]] region in northwestern Somalia's Minister of Culture Abiib Diriye Nur, and the Vice President of the [[Somali Region]] of [[Ethiopia]] Abdihakim Igal Omar.&lt;ref name="Crslalid"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional Somali Language Academy Launched in Djibouti|url=http://www.comesaria.org/site/en/news_details.php?chaine=regional-somali-language-academy-launched-in-djibouti&amp;id_news=17578&amp;id_article=119|publisher=COMESA Regional Investment Agency|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, President of Somalia [[Hassan Sheikh Mohamud]] announced that the Regional Somali Language Academy was slated to be finalized in conjunction with the governments of Djibouti and Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="Gspouslod"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somali President Orders the Use of Somali Language in the Official Documents|url=http://goobjoog.com/english/?p=9105|accessdate=21 January 2015|agency=Goobjoog|date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the scheduled projects was the construction of a new headquarters for the Academy in [[Mogadishu]], in recognition of Somalia's traditional position as the center for the development and promotion of the Somali language.&lt;ref name="Spouosaoloc"&gt;{{cite news|title=Somalia: President orders use of Somali as official language of communication|url=http://raadgoob.com/?p=40872|accessdate=22 January 2015|agency=Goobjoog|date=21 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122231839/http://raadgoob.com/?p=40872|archivedate=22 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, the foundation stone for the new Regional Somali Language Academy was officially laid at an inauguration ceremony in Mogadishu attended by President Mohamud, President of Djibouti [[Ismaïl Omar Guelleh]], federal cabinet ministers, legislators and delegates.&lt;ref name="Gpsdlnrsla"&gt;{{cite news|title=Presidents Of Somalia And Djibouti Lay New Regional Somali Language Academy|url=http://goobjoog.com/english/?p=10696|accessdate=22 February 2015|agency=Goobjoog|date=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academy is the first such regional language regulator for Somali.&lt;ref name="Crslalid"/&gt; It is officially mandated with preserving the Somali language and culture in [[Greater Somalia]].&lt;ref name="Gpsdlnrsla"/&gt; {{As of|August 2017}}, there is no representation for the Somali-speaking community in Kenya.

[[File:Robert Jungk.jpg|thumb|right|Jungk circa 1978]]
'''Robert Jungk''' ({{IPA-de|jʊŋk|lang}}; born ''Robert Baum'', also known as ''Robert Baum-Jungk''; May 11, 1913 – July 14, 1994) was an Austrian writer and journalist who wrote mostly on issues relating to [[nuclear weapons]].

==Life==
Jungk was born into a [[Jew]]ish family in [[Berlin]]. His father was [[David Baum]] (pseudonym: [[Max Jungk]], 1872, [[Miskovice]] – 1937, [[Prague]]). When [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power, Jungk was arrested and released, moved to Paris, then back to [[Nazi Germany]] to work in a subversive press service. These activities forced him to move through various cities, such as Prague, Paris, and [[Zurich]], during [[World War II]]. He continued journalism after the war.&lt;ref name=CounterPunch-2014-05-28&gt;Janette D. Sherman, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/05/28/tomorrow-is-already-here-is-it-too-late/ The Legacy of Robert Jungk -- Tomorrow is Already Here: Is It Too Late?] (2014.05.28), ''[[CounterPunch]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also well known as the inventor of [[future workshop]] which are a method for social innovation, participation by the concerned and visionary future planning "from below". In chapter six of his book ''The Big Machine'', Jungk described [[CERN]] as the place to find the "first Planetarians, earth dwellers who no longer feel loyalty to a single nation, a single continent, or a single political creed, but to common knowledge that they advance together."&lt;ref name=CounterPunch-2014-05-28/&gt; There is an international library in [[Salzburg]] called [http://www.jungk-bibliothek.at Robert-Jungk-Bibliothek für Zukunftsfragen] (Robert Jungk Library for Questions about the Future).

His book ''[[Brighter than a Thousand Suns: A Personal History of the Atomic Scientists]]'' was the first published account of the [[Manhattan Project]] and the [[German nuclear energy project|German atomic bomb project]], and its first Danish edition included a passage which implied that the project had been purposely dissuaded from developing a weapon by [[Werner Heisenberg]] and his associates (a claim strongly contested by [[Niels Bohr]]), and lead to a series of questions over a 1941 meeting between Bohr and Heisenberg in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], which was later the basis for [[Michael Frayn]]'s 1998 play, ''[[Copenhagen (play)|Copenhagen]]''.

In 1986, he received the [[Right Livelihood Award]].

In 1992 he made an [[Austrian presidential election, 1992|unsuccessful bid for the Austrian presidency]] on behalf of the [[Austrian Green Party|Green Party]].

Jungk died in [[Salzburg]].

A '''sequestrant''' is a [[food additive]] which improves the quality and stability of foods. A sequestrant forms [[chelate]] complexes with [[valence (chemistry)|polyvalent]] metal ions, especially [[copper]], [[iron]] and [[nickel]], which can prevent the oxidation of the fats in the food. Sequestrants are a type of [[preservative]].

The name comes from Latin and means "to withdraw from use" {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}.

Common sequestrants are:
* [[Calcium chloride]] (E509)
* [[Calcium acetate]] (E263)
* [[Calcium disodium ethylene diamine tetra-acetate]] (E385)
* [[Glucono delta-lactone]] (E575)
* [[Sodium gluconate]] (E576)
* [[Potassium gluconate]] (E577)
* [[Sodium tripolyphosphate]] (E451)
* [[Sodium hexametaphosphate]] (E452i)

Sodium and calcium salts of [[EDTA]] are also commonly used in many foods and beverages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6658">A '''steward''' is an [[official]] who is appointed by the legal ruling [[monarch]] to represent them in a country, and may have a mandate to govern it in their name; in the latter case, synonymous with the position of [[regent]], [[vicegerent]], [[viceroy]] (for [[Romance languages]]), [[governor]], or deputy (the Roman ''[[Roman governor|rector]]'', ''[[prefect|praefectus]]'' or ''[[vicarius]]'').

==Etymology==
From [[Old English]] ''stíweard, stiȝweard'', from ''stiȝ'' "hall, household" + ''weard'' "[[wikt:warden|warden]], keeper"; corresponding to [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''stadhouder'', [[German language|German]] ''Statthalter'' "place holder", a Germanic parallel to French ''[[lieutenant]]''.

The Old English term ''stíweard'' is attested from the 11th century. Its first element is most probably ''stiȝ-'' "house, hall" (attested only in composition; its cognate ''stiȝu'' is the ancestor of Modern English ''[[sty]]''). Old French ''estuard'' and Old Norse ''stívarðr'' are adopted from the Old English.

The German and Dutch term ([[Middle High German]] ''stat-halter'') is a parallel but independent formation (a [[calque]] of ''lieutenant'') corresponding to obsolete English ''stead holder'' (''stede haldare'' 1456; also ''stedys beryng'' (1460), ''sted-haldande'' (1375)  ''steadward'', ''steadsman'').

In medieval times, the steward was initially a servant who supervised both the lord's [[Estate (land)|estate]] and his household. However over the course of the next century, other household posts arose and involved more responsibilities. This meant that in the 13th century, there were commonly two stewards in each house—one who managed the gang estate and the other, the ''[[majordomo]]'', to manage domestic routine. Stewards commonly earned up to 3 to 4 [[Pound sterling|pounds]] per year. Stewards took care of their lord's castles when they were away. Also, stewards checked on the taxes of the serfs on his lord's [[manor]].

==British Isles==
{{main|Lord Steward}}
The [[Lord High Steward]] of England held a position of power in the 12th to 14th centuries, and the [[Lord Steward]] is the first dignitary of the court. The [[Clan Stewart|Stewart family]] traces its appellation to the office of the [[High Steward of Scotland]]. [[Lord High Steward of Ireland]] is a hereditary office held since the 15th century.

==Low Countries==
{{main|Stadtholder}}
In the Netherlands, it developed into a rare type of ''de facto'' hereditary [[head of state]] of the thus crowned [[Dutch Republic]].

Stadtholders were appointed by [[feudal]] lords to govern parts of their territory. Stadtholders could be appointed for the whole or parts of their territory by the local rulers of the independent [[Seventeen Provinces|province]]s in the [[Low Countries]], e.g. the Duke of Gelre appointed a stadtholder to represent him in [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]]. In the [[Low Countries]] (which included present-day [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]]) from the Middle Ages to the 18th century, this was originally an essentially honorary title awarded by the Spanish Habsburg kings to major noblemen in each province. But its nature changed drastically.

==Northern Europe==
{{main|Drots}}

===Danish Statholder===
* In Denmark, a ministerial high office of royal governor in the capital, at [[Copenhagen Castle]]

===Norwegian Statholder===
In Norway the office of ''Statholder'' existed both during the [[Denmark-Norway|Dano-Norwegian personal union]] from 1536 to 1814 and during the [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Swedish-Norwegian personal union]] from 1814 until it was abolished in 1873, while the union lasted until 1905. During the latter, the office was also known as ''Rigsstatholder'', i.e. Lieutenant of the Realm. The ''Statholder'' governed Norway on behalf of the King. As Norway was a separate kingdom with its own laws and institutions, it was arguably the most influential office in both Denmark-Norway and in the Swedish-Norwegian realm second to that of the king. The office was sometimes held by the Crown Prince, who was styled as Viceroy.

The term ''Statholder'' (from German ''Statthalter'') means "place holder", i.e. the one governing on behalf of the king. The modern Norwegian spelling is ''stattholder''.

==Southern Europe==

===Ban of Croatia===
{{main|Ban of Croatia}}
The Croatian office of the [[Ban of Croatia|Ban]] was equivalent of a viceroy. Ban was appointed by the monarch (King of Croats until 1102, King of [[Hungary]] 1102–1526, Austrian ruler 1527–1918) with a mandate to govern a part of country, or whole country, in the name of the King of Dalmatia, Croatia and Slavonia.

===Ban of Bosnia===
{{main|List of rulers of Bosnia}}
[[Bosnia]] was a banate of the Kingdom of Hungary 1136–1377. During that period Bosnia was governed by an autonomous hereditary viceroy, called ban. The last of them, [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko]], became the first king of the Kingdom of Bosnia.

==Eastern Europe==
{{main|Posadnik}}
{{also|Namestnik}}
The Russian equivalent of "stadtholder" is [[posadnik]]; the term sometimes occurs as "stadtholder" in English-language literature. Although there were such legendary posadniks as [[Gostomysl]] (9th century), the term first appeared in the [[Primary Chronicle]] under the year of 997 to denote the most senior official of an Eastern Slavic town. The earliest posadniks of the city of [[Novgorod]] (''Holmgard'') include a dynasty composed of [[Dobrynya]], his son [[Konstantin Dobrynich]] and [[Ostromir]].

==Freemasonry==
[[File:Stewards jewel.jpg|thumb|Freemasonry Stewards Jewel]]
[[File:Grand Stewards apron.jpg|thumb|Masonic regalia: the Grand Stewards apron]]
The office of Steward or Grand Steward is an elected office of merit in [[Freemason]]ry. The main duty of the Steward is to attend on visitors and to assist other Officers in their duties. The Grand Stewards may provide special assistance at Lodge Installations. The Stewards Jewel consists of a [[cornucopia]] with compasses above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masons.org.au/index.php|title=Freemasons NSW &amp; ACT - Home|author=|date=|website=www.masons.org.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masonic-lodge-of-education.com/lodge-officer-duties.html|title=MASONIC LODGE OFFICER DUTIES|author=|date=|website=masonic-lodge-of-education.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Matsunaga Institute for Peace and Conflict Resolution''' is a multi-disciplinary community of scholars, students and practitioners who, through academic programs and outreach, promote cross-cultural understanding and collaborative problem-solving. The institute emphasizes [[critical thinking]] and collaboration to groom leaders to address contemporary and complex issues in [[Hawaii]], the [[Asia-Pacific]] region and the world.

==Namesake==
The institute is dedicated to honoring the memory of the former U.S. Senator [[Spark Matsunaga]] and implementing his hope that "every student enrolled in Hawai'i's public university system will be exposed to peace studies". [[Peace education]] and [[Conflict resolution]] are major components of the institute's academic programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4571">A '''time temperature indicator''' ('''TTI''') is a device or smart [[label]] that shows the accumulated time-temperature history of a product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Food Packaging: Principles and Practice|first=Gordon L|last=Robertson|page=375|publisher=Marcel Dekker|location=New York|year=1993|isbn=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cFzIphx7CUQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA375#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Time temperature indicators are commonly used on [[food]], [[pharmaceutical]], and [[medical products]] to indicate exposure to excessive temperature (and time at temperature).

In contrast, a [[Temperature data logger]] measures and records the temperatures for a specified time period.  The digital data can be downloaded and analyzed.

==Technology==
There are a large number of different time temperature indicators available in the market, based on different technologies.  Some devices are based migration of dye through a [[filter paper]], while others contain pouches with [[bacterial]] fluids that change color when certain time-temperature combinations have been reached.  To the degree that these physical changes in the indicator match the degradation rate of the food, the indicator can help indicate probable food degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital [[Temperature data logger]]s are available to indicate the full temperature history of a shipment to help identify the time period that out-of-[[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]] temperatures were encountered.  This temperature history can be used to calculate the loss of [[shelf life]] or the likelihood of spoilage.  These small recorders are also used to identify the time (and thus location) of a shipment when the problem occurred, which allows for corrective action.

==TTI's food industry==
Time-temperature indicators can be used on food products that are dependent on a controlled [[temperature]] environment.  Certain technologies can also be used for [[frozen food]] and the [[cold chain]].

===Benefits===
Surveys within the [[European Union|EU]] projects "Freshlabel" and "Chill-on" have shown a positive feedback by [[consumer]]s to the use of TTIs on food products.  As TTIs help assure the [[cool chain]] of food products, they are expected to reduce the amount of [[food waste]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/foodwewaste_fullreport08_05_08.pdf | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as reducing the number of [[foodborne illness]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs237/en/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
The [[World Health Organization]] regulates the use of TTIs for certain medical products.  There is extensive regulation by the FDA on the use of TTIs on US seafood products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/HazardAnalysisCriticalControlPointsHACCP/SeafoodHACCP/default.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trailblazer''' was a United States [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) program intended to develop a capability to analyze data carried on communications networks like the Internet. It was intended to track entities using communication methods such as cell phones and e-mail.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;&lt;ref name=physorg/&gt;

NSA employees [[J. Kirk Wiebe]], [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], Ed Loomis, and [[House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] staffer [[Diane Roark]] complained to the [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense's Inspector General]] (IG) about waste, fraud, and abuse in the program, and the fact that a successful operating prototype existed.  The complaint was accepted by the IG and an investigation began that lasted until mid-2005 when the final results were issued.  The results were largely hidden, as the report given to the public was heavily (90%) redacted, while the original report was heavily classified, thus restricting the ability of most people to see it.

The people who filed the IG complaint were later raided by armed [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) agents. While the Government threatened to prosecute all who signed the IG report, it ultimately chose to pursue an NSA Senior Executive [[Thomas Andrews Drake]] who helped with the report internally to NSA and who had spoken with a reporter about the project. Drake was later charged under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]]. His defenders claimed this was retaliation.&lt;ref name=NYer2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=bamford/&gt; The charges against him were later dropped, and he agreed to plead guilty to having committed a misdemeanor under the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]], something that [[Jesselyn Radack]] of the [[Government Accountability Project]] (which helped represent him) called an "act of [[civil disobedience]]".&lt;ref name=rad1/&gt;

== Background ==
Trailblazer was chosen over a similar program named [[ThinThread]], a less costly project which had been designed with built-in privacy protections for United States citizens.&lt;ref name=NYer2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=bamford/&gt; Trailblazer was later linked to the [[NSA electronic surveillance program]] and the [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy]].&lt;ref name=NYer2011/&gt;

In 2002 a consortium led by [[Science Applications International Corporation]] was chosen by the NSA to produce a technology demonstration platform in a contract worth $280 million. Project participants included [[Boeing]], [[Computer Sciences Corporation]], and [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The project was overseen by NSA Deputy Director [[William B. Black, Jr.]], an NSA worker who had gone to SAIC, and then been re-hired back to NSA by NSA director Michael Hayden in 2000.&lt;ref name="wired1007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BaltSun20060531"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun0601"/&gt; SAIC had also hired a former NSA director to its management: [[Bobby Inman]].&lt;ref name=bam201&gt;Bamford, Shadow Factory, Doubleday, 2008, p201&lt;/ref&gt; SAIC also participated in the concept definition phase of Trailblazer.&lt;ref name=wtech/&gt;&lt;ref name=flib/&gt;

[[File:Redacted-dod-oig-audit-requirements-for-the.pdf|page=1|thumb|250px|right|Redacted version of the DoD Inspector General audit, obtained through the [[Freedom of Information Act]] by the [[Project on Government Oversight]] and others.&lt;ref name=rad1/&gt;&lt;ref name=pogo/&gt;]]

The NSA Inspector General issued a report on Trailblazer that "discussed improperly based contract cost increases, non-conformance in the management of the Statement of Work, and excessive labor rates for contractor personnel."&lt;ref name=dodfoia1/&gt;

In 2004 the DoD IG report criticized the program (see the Whistleblowing section below). It said that the "NSA 'disregarded solutions to urgent national security needs'" and "that TRAILBLAZER was poorly executed and overly expensive&amp;nbsp;..." Several contractors for the project were worried about cooperating with DoD's audit for fear of "management reprisal." The Director of NSA  "nonconcurred" with several statements in the IG audit, and the report contains a discussion of those disagreements.&lt;ref&gt;See the IG report, linked in the article.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, NSA director [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael Hayden]] told a Senate hearing that the Trailblazer program was several hundred million dollars over budget and years behind schedule.&lt;ref name="spacew1"/&gt; In 2006 the program was shut down,&lt;ref name=NYer2011/&gt;  after having cost billions of US Dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Government Accountability Project website {{cite web |url=http://www.whistleblower.org/program-areas/homeland-security-a-human-rights/surveillance/nsa-whistleblowers-bill-binney-a-j-kirk-wiebe |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212065859/http://www.whistleblower.org/program-areas/homeland-security-a-human-rights/surveillance/nsa-whistleblowers-bill-binney-a-j-kirk-wiebe |archivedate=2013-12-12 |df= }}, accessed June 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Several anonymous NSA sources told ''Newsweek'' later on that the project was a "wasteful failure".&lt;ref name=hosenball/&gt;

The new project replacing Trailblazer is called [[Turbulence (NSA)|Turbulence]].&lt;ref name=NYer2011/&gt;

== Whistleblowing ==
According to a 2011 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article, in the early days of the project several NSA employees met with Diane S Roark, an NSA budget expert on the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Intelligence Committee]]. They aired their grievances about Trailblazer. In response, NSA director Michael Hayden sent out a memo saying that "individuals, in a session with our congressional overseers, took a position in direct opposition to one that we had corporately decided to follow&amp;nbsp;... Actions contrary to our decisions will have a serious adverse effect on our efforts to transform N.S.A., and I cannot tolerate them."&lt;ref name=NYer2011 /&gt;

In September 2002, several people filed a complaint with the Department of Defense IG's office regarding problems with Trailblazer: they included Roark (aforementioned), as well as ex-NSA senior analysts Bill Binney, Kirk Wiebe, and Senior Computer Systems Analyst Ed Loomis, who had all quit the agency over concerns about its mismanagement of acquisition and allegedly illegal domestic spying.&lt;ref name=NYer2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=harri1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WP20100714 /&gt; A major source for the report was NSA senior officer Thomas Andrews Drake. Drake had been complaining to his superiors for some time about problems at the agency, and about the superiority of ThinThread over Trailblazer, for example, at protecting privacy.&lt;ref name=WP20100714 /&gt; Drake gave info to DoD during its investigation of the matter.&lt;ref name=WP20100714 /&gt; Roark also went to her boss at the House committee, [[Porter Goss]], about problems, but was rebuffed.&lt;ref name=wapo /&gt; She also attempted to contact [[William Rehnquist]], the Supreme Court Chief Justice at the time.&lt;ref name=WP20100714 /&gt;

Drake's own boss, [[Maureen Baginski]], the third-highest officer at NSA, quit partly over concerns about the legality of its behavior.&lt;ref name=NYer2011 /&gt;

In 2003, the [[NSA IG]] (not the [[Office_of_the_Inspector_General,_U.S._Department_of_Defense|DoD IG]])&lt;ref name=WP20100714 /&gt; had declared Trailblazer an expensive failure.&lt;ref name=spacew1 /&gt;  It had cost more than $1 billion.&lt;ref name="BaltimoreSun0601" /&gt;&lt;ref name=econ1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=shane1 /&gt;

In 2005, the DoD IG produced a report on the result of its investigation of the complaint of Roark and the others in 2002. This report was not released to the public, but it has been described as very negative.&lt;ref name=harri1 /&gt; Mayer writes that it hastened the closure of Trailblazer, which was at the time in trouble from Congress for being over budget.&lt;ref name=NYer2011 /&gt;

In November 2005, Drake contacted Siobhan Gorman, a reporter of ''The Baltimore Sun''.&lt;ref name=hosenball /&gt;&lt;ref name=shane2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=wired1 /&gt; Gorman wrote several articles about problems at the NSA, including articles on Trailblazer. This series got her an award from the Society of Professional Journalists.&lt;ref name=hosenball /&gt;

In 2005, President [[George W. Bush]] ordered the FBI to find whoever had disclosed information about the [[NSA electronic surveillance program]] and its disclosure in the ''New York Times''. Eventually, this investigation led to the people who had filed the 2002 DoD IG request, even though they had nothing to do with the ''New York Times'' disclosure. In 2007, the houses of Roark, Binney, and Wiebe were raided by armed FBI agents. According to Mayer, Binney claims the FBI pointed guns at his head and that of his wife. Wiebe said it reminded him of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="NYer2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name=harri1 /&gt; None of these people were ever charged with any crime. Four months later, Drake was raided in November 2007 and his computers and documents were confiscated.

In 2010 Drake was indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges of obstructing justice, providing false information, and violating the [[Espionage Act of 1917]],&lt;ref name="hosenball" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whistleblowerorg1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="doj" /&gt; part of President [[Barack Obama]]'s crackdown on whistleblowers and "leakers".&lt;ref name=hosenball /&gt;&lt;ref name=harri1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=shane2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=naka2 /&gt; The government tried to get Roark to testify to a conspiracy, and made similar requests to Drake, offering him a plea bargain. They both refused.&lt;ref name="NYer2011" /&gt;

In June 2011, the ten original charges against Drake were dropped; instead he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor.&lt;ref name=rad1 /&gt;

|quote="Positive liberty... is a valid universal goal. I do not know why I should have been held to doubt this, or, for that matter, the further proposition, that democratic self-government is a fundamental human need, something valuable in itself, whether or not it clashes with the claims of negative liberty or of any other goal... What I am mainly concerned to establish is that, whatever may be the common ground between them, and whatever is liable to graver distortion, negative and positive liberty are not the same thing."
|source = Isaiah Berlin, ''Five Essays on Liberty: An Introduction''&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', p 1–54&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

"'''Two Concepts of Liberty'''" was the inaugural [[lecture]] delivered by the liberal philosopher [[Isaiah Berlin]] before the [[University of Oxford]] on 31 October 1958. It was subsequently published as a 57-page pamphlet by Oxford at the [[Clarendon Press]]. It also appears in the collection of Berlin's papers entitled ''Four Essays on Liberty'' (1969) and was more recently reissued in a collection entitled simply ''Liberty'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Four Essays on Liberty, Oxford University Press, 1969. Superseded by Liberty.&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay, with its analytical approach to the definition of political concepts, re-introduced the study of political philosophy to the methods of [[analytic philosophy]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} It is also one of Berlin's first expressions of his ethical ontology of [[value-pluralism]]. Berlin defined negative liberty (as the term "liberty" was used by [[Thomas Hobbes]] &lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', page 170&lt;/ref&gt;) as the absence of coercion or interference with agents' possible private actions, by an exterior social-body. He also defined it as a comparatively recent political ideal, which re-emerged in the late 17th century, after its slow and inarticulate birth in the Ancient doctrines of [[Antiphon (person)|Antiphon the Sophist]], the [[Cyrenaics|Cyrenaic discipleship]], and of [[Otanes]] after the death of [[Bardiya|pseudo-Smerdis]].&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', page 33&lt;/ref&gt; In an introduction to the essay, Berlin writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"As for Otanes, he wished neither to rule nor to be ruled—the exact opposite of Aristotle's notion of true civic liberty. ... [This ideal] remains isolated and, until Epicurus, undeveloped ... the notion had not explicitly emerged".&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', ''Five Essays on Liberty: An Introduction'', page 33-4&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Summary ==

=== Positive liberty ===
:"is involved in the answer to the question 'What, or who, is the source of control or interference that can determine someone to do, or be, this rather than that?' The two questions are clearly different, even though the answers to them may overlap."&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, I: "Two Concepts of Liberty",1958&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Positive liberty]] may be understood as self-mastery, and includes one's having a role in choosing who governs the society of which one is a part.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Berlin traced positive liberty from Aristotle's definition of citizenship, which is historically derived from the social role of the freemen of classical Athens: it was, Berlin argued, the liberty in choosing their government granted to citizens, and extolled, most famously, by [[Pericles]]. Berlin granted that both concepts of liberty represent valid human ideals, and that both forms of liberty are necessary in any free and civilised society.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== Negative liberty ===
:"liberty in the negative sense involves an answer to the question: 'What is the area within which the subject—a person or group of persons—is or should be left to do or be what he is able to do or be, without interference by other persons'."&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, I: "Two Concepts of Liberty",1958&lt;/ref&gt;

For Berlin, [[negative liberty]] represents a different, and sometimes contradictory, understanding of the concept of liberty, which needs to be carefully examined. Its later proponents (such as [[Tocqueville]], [[Benjamin Constant|Constant]], [[Montesquieu]], [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]] and [[John Stuart Mill]],{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} who accepted [[Chrysippus]]' understanding of [[self-determination]])&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', page 171 and 260&lt;/ref&gt; insisted that constraint and discipline were the antithesis of liberty and so were (and are) less prone to confusing liberty and constraint in the manner of rationalists and the philosophical harbingers of totalitarianism.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} This concept of negative liberty, Berlin argued, constitutes an alternative, and sometimes even opposed, concept to positive liberty, and one often closer to the intuitive modern usage of the word.  Berlin considered negative liberty one of the distinguishing concepts of modern liberalism and observed
:"The fathers of liberalism--Mill and Constant--want more than this minimum: they demand a maximum degree of non-interference compatible with the minimum demands of social life. It seems unlikely that this extreme demand for liberty has ever been made by any but a small minority of highly civilized and self-conscious human beings."&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, I: "Two Concepts of Liberty",1958&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abuse of positive liberty ===
Isaiah Berlin notes that historically positive liberty has proven particularly susceptible to rhetorical abuse; especially from the 18th century onwards, it has either been paternalistically re-drawn from the third-person, or conflated with the concept of negative liberty and thus disguised underlying value-conflicts.

Berlin contended that under the influence of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[G. W. F. Hegel]], modern political thinkers often conflated positive liberty with rational action, based upon a rational knowledge to which, it is argued, only a certain elite or social group has access.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Bern, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', page 257&lt;/ref&gt; This rationalist conflation was open to political abuses, which encroached on negative liberty, when such interpretations of positive liberty were, in the nineteenth century, used to defend nationalism, paternalism, social engineering, historicism, and collective rational control over human destiny. Berlin argued that, following this line of thought, demands for freedom paradoxically could become demands for forms of collective control and discipline—those deemed necessary for the "self-mastery" or "self-determination" of nations, classes, democratic communities, and even humanity as a whole. There is thus an elective affinity, for Berlin, between positive liberty, when it is rhetorically conflated with goals imposed from the third-person that the individual is told they "should" rationally desire, and the justifications for political [[totalitarianism]], which contrary to [[value-pluralism]], presupposed that values exist in [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] harmony. {{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Dialectic of positive and negative liberty ===
Berlin did not argue that the concept of positive liberty should be rejected—on the contrary, he recognised it as one human value among many, and one necessary to any free society.&lt;ref&gt;Four Essays on Liberty, Oxford University Press, 1969. Superseded by Liberty.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that positive liberty was a genuine and valuable version of liberty, so long as it was identified with the autonomy of individuals, and not with the achievement of goals that individuals 'ought to' 'rationally' desire.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', p 39&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin argued, rather, that these differing concepts showed the plurality, and incompatibility of human values, and the need to analytically distinguish and trade-off between, rather than conflate, them.&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, (Oxford 2004) ''Liberty'', page 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Berlin offers in his "Two Concepts of Liberty" essay, "Where it is to be drawn is a matter of argument, indeed of haggling. Men are largely interdependent, and no man's activity is so completely private as never to obstruct the lives of others in any way. 'Freedom for the pike is death for the minnows'; the liberty of some must depend on the restraint of others. Freedom for an Oxford don, others have been known to add, is a very different thing from freedom for an Egyptian peasant."

'''''Viața Românească'''''{{efn|Previously spelled '''''Viața Romînească''''', due to [[Romanian alphabet#Î versus Â|changes in the Romanian spelling system]].}} ({{IPA-ro|ˈvjat͡sa romɨˈne̯askə|lang}}, "The Romanian Life") is a monthly [[literary magazine]] published in [[Romania]]. Formerly the platform of the [[left-wing]] traditionalist trend known as [[poporanism]], it is now one of the [[Writers' Union of Romania]]'s main venues.

The magazine, dedicated to literary and scientific issues, was published from March 1906 to August 1916 and from September 1920 to September 1940, first in [[Iași]] and then, after 1930, in [[Bucharest]]. The magazine was under the leadership of [[Constantin Stere]] (in charge of political content), [[Paul Bujor]] and, later, [[Ioan Cantacuzino]] (for scientific matters), [[Garabet Ibrăileanu]] (until 1933), [[Mihai Ralea]] and [[George Călinescu]] (for literary matters).

[[File:1909 - Viaţa Românească.PNG|Cover of ''Viaţa Romînească'' from 1909.|thumb|right]]
Suppressed by the [[fascism|fascist]] [[National Legionary State]] in 1940, ''Viața Românească'' resumed publishing, first in a transitional form, from November 1944 to July 1946, when it was edited by Ralea. Finally, the present magazine was published from July 1948 as a monthly magazine of the [[Romanian Writers' Society]] and, from March 1949, of the Writers' Union of Romania.

'''William Haughey, Baron Haughey''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 1956 in [[Glasgow]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressteam.co.uk/index.php/news/tycoon-unveils-house-plans PressTeam Scotland Ltd - Tycoon unveils house plans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is a Scottish [[businessman]], [[philanthropist]]&lt;ref name="ET"/&gt; and [[chairperson|chairman]] of City Facilities Management Holdings Ltd.

==Career==
Haughey had attended [[Holyrood Secondary School]]&lt;ref name=early/&gt; followed by [[Langside College]],&lt;ref name=insiderprofile/&gt; and then worked in the [[refrigeration]] and [[air conditioning]] industry in [[Abu Dhabi]] before returning to Scotland to set up his own business with £70,000 of savings he had accrued. He founded City Refrigeration, a refrigeration equipment and maintenance supplier, with his wife Susan in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-22988889 | work=BBC News | title=Sir Willie Haughey's City Refrigeration sees profits up | date=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.cityfm.com/about-city/ | publisher=City Facilities Management | title=About City | accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caledonia House (geograph 3220465).jpg|left|thumb|City Facilities Management headquarters in [[Glasgow]]]]
After securing a service contract with the [[Wellpark Brewery|Tennent's]] company in the 1980s which led to agreements with further breweries, he sold a majority stake to the [[3i]] equity firm.&lt;ref name=insiderprofile/&gt; A downturn in the financial situation caused Haughey to sell two other small companies he had established back to City to increase turnover and broaden the range of services provided by the firm. In 1997 the firm signed a deal with [[Asda]] to maintain refrigeration equipment in stores throughout the United Kingdom. Due to the success of that venture, Haughey and his wife found themselves able to buy back almost full control of City from 3i in 1999,&lt;ref name=stroke/&gt; allowing them to have decisive input on its future strategic direction;&lt;ref name=insiderprofile/&gt; a gradual, continuous expansion of its operations followed over the subsequent decades.&lt;ref name=stroke&gt;{{cite web

Haughey backed the [[Entrepreneurial Spark]] start-up accelerator, hosting the Glasgow 'hatchery' in his City Refrigeration Headquarters.&lt;ref name=insiderprofile&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.insider.co.uk/special-reports/big-profile-blast-past-sir-10795465|title=The Big Profile Blast from the Past: Sir Willie Haughey, City Refrigerations Holdings|work=Scottish Business Insider|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=1 May 2013|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City corporate headquarters are at ''Caledonia House'' in [[Gorbals]], Glasgow, having relocated from nearby [[Shawfield]] in 2009 when those premises were demolished for construction of the [[A74(M) and M74 motorways#M74 northern extension to M8 (2008–2011)|M74 motorway completion]].&lt;ref name=insiderprofile/&gt; The new site was virtually on the site of Haughey's childhood home which had been demolished years earlier.&lt;ref name=early&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.williehaughey.com:80/city-refrigeration-early.aspx|title=The Early Years|publisher=Willie Haughey: An Inspirational Scottish Businessman|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614163553/http://www.williehaughey.com:80/city-refrigeration-early.aspx|archive-date=14 June 2012|date=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technical division is located in Clydesmill Industrial Estate near to [[Cambuslang]].

By 2017, the company had been rebranded as ''City Facilities Management'' and launched a European arm, headquartered in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.insider.co.uk/news/sir-willie-haugheys-city-refrigeration-10814391|title=Sir Willie Haughey's City Refrigeration Holdings launched new European venture|work=Scottish Business Insider|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=17 July 2017|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their international clients include [[Coles Supermarkets]] in Australia.&lt;ref name=insiderprofile/&gt;

==Personal life and awards==
Haughey married Susan in 1978. He has one son Kenny.&lt;ref name=insiderprofile/&gt; In his spare time he enjoys playing golf and tournament poker. He once revealed that he winds down every Friday night with a [[fish supper]].&lt;ref name="ET"&gt;{{cite web|title=I may be a millionaire but there's nothing I like better than a fish supper on a Friday night|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/12849417.I_may_be_a_millionaire_but_there_apos_s_nothing_I_like_better_than_a_fish_supper_on_a_Friday_night/|publisher=''[[Evening Times]]''|accessdate=16 January 2017|date=3 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2013, it was announced he was going to be a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] peer in the [[House of Lords]].

On 18 September 2013 he was created a [[life peer]] taking the title '''Baron Haughey''', of [[Hutchesontown]] in the City of [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=60635 |date=23 September 2013 |page=18709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Haughey was reported as having become involved in discussions between the [[Scottish Football Association]] and [[Queen's Park F.C.]] over the future use of [[Hampden Park]], the stadium used by the former but owned by the latter. With the SFA threatening to move their matches to [[Edinburgh]] and unwilling to pay more than £2 million to buy Hampden from Queen's Park while the club demanded £6 million, Haughey stepped in with an offer to 'split the difference' by adding a contribution to raise the purchase offer to £4 million, in order for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] matches and cup finals to remain in their traditional Glasgow home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/scotland/scottish-fa-close-to-4m-purchase-of-hampden-park-reports-1-4797517 |title=Scottish FA close to £4m purchase of Hampden Park - reports |date=10 September 2018 |accessdate=11 September 2018 |work=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17089">'''Youth unemployment in Italy''' discusses the statistics, trends, causes and consequences concerning the topic of unemployment among young Italians. 

According to the [[European Union]]’s standards, youth unemployment refers to people of age between 15 and 24. [[Italy]] displays one of the highest rates of youth unemployment among the 35 member countries of the [[OECD|Organization of Economic Co-Operation and Development]] (OECD).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/economia/miojob/lavoro/2017/10/10/news/ocse_l_italia_e_il_terzo_posto_peggiore_per_i_giovani_che_cercano_lavoro-177863595/?refresh_ce|title=Ocse, l'Italia è il terzo posto peggiore per i giovani che cercano lavoro|last=|first=|date=|website=La Repubblica.it|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian youth unemployment rate started raising dramatically since the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]] reaching its peak of 42.67% in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.oecd.org/unemp/youth-unemployment-rate.htm|title=Youth unemployment rate|last=|first=|date=|website=OECD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/economia/2015/04/29/news/il_lavoro_negli_anni_della_crisi_l_italia_paga_il_conto_la_disoccupazione_e_cresciuta_del_108_-112996138/|title=Il lavoro negli anni della crisi: l'Italia paga il conto, la disoccupazione è cresciuta del 108%|last=|first=|date=|website=Repubblica.it|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, among the EU member states, the youth unemployment rate of Italy (35.1%) was exceeded by only [[Spain]] and [[Greece]]. The Italian youth unemployment rate was more than the double of the total EU average rate of 16.7% in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/266228/youth-unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/|title=Youth unemployment rate in Europe (EU member states) as of August 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=Statista|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While youth unemployment is extremely high compared to EU standards, the Italian total unemployment rate (11.1%) is closer to EU average (7.4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Unemployment_rates,_seasonally_adjusted,_October_2017_(%25)_F2.png|title=Unemployment rates, seasonally adjusted, October 2017 (%)|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Statistics ==
[[Youth unemployment]] in Italy is quantified by many measures. According to EU statistics, 10.6% of all Italian 15–24 year-olds were unemployed in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tespm080&amp;plugin=1|title=Youth unemployment ratio (15-24)|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|publisher=European Commission|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparatively, in the [[European Union]] 28 the rate that year was 8.4%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These levels are deceptively low because they include both active and inactive youth, which counts students and those not looking for work. Leaving out the inactive population, 40.3% of 15–24 year-olds who were actively part of the [[labor force]] were unemployed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tipslm80&amp;plugin=1|title=Youth unemployment rate - % of active population aged 15-24|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|publisher=European Commission|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 22% of the same population had been unemployed for 12 or more months, meaning more than half of the unemployed active Italian youth had been so long-term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=yth_empl_120&amp;lang=en|title=Youth long-term unemployment rate (12 months or longer) by sex and age|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|publisher=European Commission|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another subset of the youth population is neither in employment nor in education and training (NEET), which in 2015 represented 21.4% of Italy's 15–24 year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tesem150&amp;plugin=1|title=Youth neither in employment nor in education and training (NEET) rate, age group 15-24|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|publisher=European Commission|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to complete unemployment, Italian youth also have high levels of [[underemployment]]. The number of 15–24 year-olds who worked full-time (30 hours per week) dropped from 1,597,000 in 2000 to 676,000 in 2015, while the number of [[part-time worker]]s increased from 172,000 to 237,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stats.oecd.org/|title=FTPT employment based on a common definition|last=|first=|date=|website=OECD.Stat|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, 83.7% of the young part-time workers in 2015 did so involuntarily because they could not find full-time employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=yth_empl_080&amp;lang=en|title=Involuntary part-time employment as percentage of the total part-time employment for young people by sex and age|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|publisher=European Commission|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Welfare system and labor market policy ===
From a structural perspective, Italy's problem of youth [[unemployment]] is caused by its [[protectionist]] welfare system and [[labor market]]. In 2015, 62.4% 15–24 year-olds who were registered unemployed for 6–11 months did not receive any benefits or assistance; the same rate measured in the population of 15–74 year-olds was 52.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitViewTableAction.do|title=Unemployment by sex, age, duration of unemployment and distinction registration/benefits (%)|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|publisher=European Commission|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this demonstrates that benefits are exclusive for people of all ages in Italy, the young unemployed are left out at a rate 10% higher than the general population. This can be attributed to the country's [[corporatist]] structure; similarly to Greece, Spain, and Portugal (grouped into the "Southern Model" of European welfare) benefits in Italy are distributed in a very fragmented manner according to occupation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferrera|first=Maurizio|date=1996-02-01|title=The 'Southern Model' of Welfare in Social Europe|url=http://esp.sagepub.com/content/6/1/17|journal=Journal of European Social Policy|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=17–37|doi=10.1177/095892879600600102|issn=0958-9287}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are separate benefit schemes, or "micro-schemes", for specific private and public sectors, types of self-employment, and the large group of industrial workers called INPS.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This system is split into the core group of labor market insiders receives generous benefits (such as pensions), while the irregular workers receive minimal benefits.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, upon retirement an institutional worker would receive a pension of 89% their average net earnings, but a non-institutional worker would receive only 19%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Paradoxically, this "economic protection" model makes it difficult for young people to get their first job because they have never been part of the labor market.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cinalli|first=Manlio|last2=Giugni|first2=Marco|date=2013-07-01|title=New challenges for the welfare state: The emergence of youth unemployment regimes in Europe?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ijsw.12016/abstract|journal=International Journal of Social Welfare|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=290–299|doi=10.1111/ijsw.12016|issn=1468-2397}}&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate, the unemployment benefits given to an Italian 18 year-old who has never had a job is 0% of average net earnings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to receiving nonexistent/minimal benefits, a study also found youth were excluded based on factors including: the prerequisites for coverage, the age coverage is extended to, and sanctions for incorrectly using the system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Italy's model has exclusive unemployment benefits coupled with inflexible labor market policy (which means workers have high employment protection and are unlikely to be fired), which creates inhospitable conditions for young people seeking jobs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/els/emp/oecdindicatorsofemploymentprotection.htm|title=OECD Indicators of Employment Protection - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tertiary education system ===
Italy's [[university]] system is another force driving youth unemployment. In 2005, the gap between finishing school and obtaining employment 51.3 months, much higher than the EU average of 30 months.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pastore|first=Francesco|year=2012|title=Youth Unemployment in Italy at the Time of the New Great Depression|url=http://www.youthpolicy.org/library/documents/youth-unemployment-in-italy-at-the-time-of-the-new-great-depression/|journal=Friedrerich Ebert Stiftung|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though 75% of Italian students earn a high school diploma that qualifies them to enter a university (one of the highest levels out of the OECD countries), only 70% of those students actually enroll in a university.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Of those who do attend a university, the educational system leaves them unprepared for the labor market. One reason is that students do not have contact with the labor market and do not gain work experience; 26.1% of unemployed youth have zero work experience, and until recently universities did not even have career services to connect students to job opportunities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-09/la-dolce-vita-eludes-italian-students-found-unemployable|title=La Dolce Vita Eludes Italian Students Found Unemployable|last=Staley|first=Oliver|date=2013-06-09|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courses generally do not involve practical application of the subject and there are not many educational internships.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Another characteristic of the Italian university system is that students take an extended amount of time to finish their degrees (for instance, students are allowed to retake their final exams up to six times).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Graduates are then overqualified for the labor market, meaning they have a higher skill level than what is in demand (called a vertical mismatch).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Employment_rates_of_recent_graduates|title=Employment rates of recent graduates - Statistics Explained|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This forces university graduates to take jobs usually reserved for people with lower skill levels, such as those with secondary education or other post-secondary training.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Young non-university graduates then experience higher rates of unemployment (45%) than their degree-holding counterparts (25.6%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=edat_lfse_25&amp;lang=en|title=Unemployment rates of young people not in education and training by sex, educational attainment level and years since completion of highest level of education|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|publisher=European Commission|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==

=== Emigration ===
In the last years, the media in Italy increasingly addresses the issue of the international migration flows of young people as a phenomenon of [[Human capital flight|brain drain.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bruegel.org/2014/03/the-global-race-for-talent-europes-migration-challenge/|title=The global race for talent: Europe’s migration challenge|last=Münz|first=Rainer|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/scuola/studiare-e-lavorare-all-estero/notizie/se-ne-vanno-giovani-laureati-nostra-vita-genitori-nell-italia-figli-lontani-3ab07376-9c5f-11e7-9e5e-7cf41a352984.shtml|title=Se ne vanno giovani e laureati: la nostra vita di genitori nell’Italia dei figli lontani|last=|first=|date=|website=Corriere.it|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/notizie/2017-07-06/oltre-250000-italiani-emigrano-all-estero-erano-300000-dopoguerra-094053.shtml?uuid=AEuX6nsB|title=Oltre 250mila italiani emigrano all’estero, quasi quanti nel Dopoguerra|last=Carli|first=Andrea|date=2017|website=Il Sole 24 ORE|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high rate of unemployment encourages young citizens to leave the country. In fact, the main reason of the high numbers of young people leaving the country is the prospect of job opportunities abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2015/09/12/lavoro-il-61-dei-giovani-italiani-pronto-a-emigrare-per-cercarlo-allestero/2029721/|title=Lavoro, “il 61% dei giovani italiani pronto a emigrare per cercarlo all’estero”|last=|first=|date=|website=Il Fatto Quotidiano|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Youth emigration as a consequence results in the Italian government losing its investments in education and a considerable amount of young labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Southern European Diaspora : Youth, Unemployment, and Migration|last=Ricucci|first=Roberta|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the majority of the cases, the young unemployed emigrate in either other countries of the EU (mainly the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]]) or in the [[United States]] and [[Australia]]. In 2016, more than 39% of Italian emigrants were of age between 18 and 34. Additionally, the percentage of young Italian emigrants is increasing every year at a steady rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2017/10/17/italiani-allestero-nel-2016-emigrati-in-124mila-il-39-ha-tra-i-18-e-i-34-anni-regno-unito-meta-preferita/3918408/|title=Italiani all’estero, nel 2016 emigrati in 124mila: il 39% ha tra i 18 e i 34 anni.

== North-South Division ==
It is often argued that Italy is made up of two different economies, one belonging to the North and one to the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21651261-north-limps-ahead-south-swoons-tale-two-economies|title=Italy’s regional divide: A tale of two economies|last=|first=|date=|website=The Economist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of youth unemployment, there is a regional divide between North and South within Italy. In 2016, Italy presented one of the most internally diverse regional unemployment rates among the EU member states (together with other Southern European countries such as [[Greece]] and [[Spain]]). More than half of the young population was unemployed in the southern regions of Italy ([[Calabria]], [[Campania]], [[Apulia|Puglia]] and [[Sicily|Sicilia]]). More precisely, the youth unemployment rates of Calabria reached an historical European peak of 58.7% in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/economia/2017/04/27/disoccupati-sud-italia-doppio-media-ue_bca1ebab-3952-4b15-8a02-334f1aaa5cdf.html|title=Calabria al top Ue per disoccupazione giovanile|last=|first=|date=|website=Ansa.it|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, unemployment rates in the northern regions (such as [[Lombardy|Lombardia]], [[Piedmont|Piemonte]] and [[Veneto]]) varied between 5% and 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Labour_market_statistics_at_regional_level|title=Labour market statistics at regional level|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3217494/5786257/KS-HA-14-001-04-EN.PDF/6e76839c-650e-43d9-80f8-ca12da933f07|title=Labour Market|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
