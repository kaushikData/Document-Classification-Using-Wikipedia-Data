The '''A6003''' is an A-class road in [[England]], linking [[Kettering]] in [[Northamptonshire]] with [[Corby]] and [[Oakham]], the latter in [[Rutland]]. The road briefly enters [[Leicestershire]] between the villages of [[Rockingham, Northamptonshire|Rockingham]] and [[Caldecott, Rutland|Caldecott]]. The road forms the principal link between Corby and the rest of Northamptonshire, as well as between Rutland and Northamptonshire. The entire length of the road is {{convert|21|mi|km}}.

==Route==
The road starts at junction 10 of the [[A14 road (England)|A14]], heading past [[Wicksteed Park]] and into Kettering. Through the town it is a single carriageway until crossing the [[A43 road|A43]] at a [[Traffic light|signal-]][[Roundabout#Controlled_roundabouts|controlled roundabout]]. From here it passes an industrial development and heads north towards Corby. The stretch between the A43 and the [[A6014 road]] in Corby is the only length of [[dual carriageway]] on the route. As at July 2012 a [[Bypass route|bypass]] is under construction from Barford Bridge on the A6003 to the A43 west of [[Stanion]] to relieve the traffic on the single carriageway passing through [[Geddington]] on the A43.&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/investment-in-local-major-transport-schemes-update/A43-Corby.pdf Department for transport A14 - A43 link road, accessed 18 September 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224055528/http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/investment-in-local-major-transport-schemes-update/A43-Corby.pdf |date=24 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theconstructionindex.co.uk/news/view/interserve-wins-24m-corby-link-road ''Interserve win £24m contract to build the new A43 Corby link road for Northamptonshire County Council'' Construction Index 25 June 2012 accessed 18 September 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Skirting the edge of Corby, the road passes the [[Eyebrook Reservoir]] before crossing the [[A47 road|A47]] at a roundabout at [[Uppingham]]. North of here it passes [[Rutland Water]] before arriving at [[Oakham]], where a new bypass has been constructed.

'''Beetham Estate Gardens''' is a neighbourhood in the twin island republic of Trinidad and Tobago. It is located south of [[Laventille]] and northeast of [[Sea Lots]]. It is bordered from west to east by the [[Beetham Highway]] and the [[Eastern Main Road]]and falls under the administration of Trinidad's capital city, Port- of- Spain. Formerly, a [[slum]] called "rat town", the community has evolved as a residential area but is still rife with systemic violence and is a clear example of environmental discrimination. In 2008–9 the government, under the leadership of the late Patrick Manning, built a 1.20 meter high wall around the area in preparation for the [[5th Summit of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/16/trinidad-tobago-americas-summit | title=Wall built for Americas summit seen as symbol of wealth disparity in Trinidad | publisher=TheGuardian.com | accessdate=2018-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Brunton.JPG|thumb|A standard Brunton Geo, used commonly by geologists]]
A '''Brunton compass''', properly known as the '''Brunton Pocket Transit''', is a precision [[compass]] made by [[Brunton, Inc.]] of [[Riverton, WY|Riverton]], [[Wyoming]]. The instrument was patented in 1894 by a Canadian-born geologist named David W. Brunton. Unlike most modern compasses, the Brunton Pocket Transit utilizes [[Magnetic damping|magnetic induction damping]] rather than fluid to damp needle oscillation.  Although Brunton, Inc. makes many other types of magnetic compasses, the Brunton Pocket Transit is a specialized instrument used widely by those needing to make accurate navigational and slope-angle measurements in the field. Users are primarily [[geologist]]s, but [[archaeologist]]s, [[environmental engineer]]s, [[mining engineer]]s and [[surveying|surveyor]]s also make use of the Brunton's capabilities. The [[United States Army]] has adopted the Pocket Transit as the M2 Compass for use by crew-served [[artillery]].

==Overview==
The Pocket Transit may be adjusted for [[Earth's magnetic field|declination angle]] according to one's location on the Earth. It is used to get directional degree measurements ([[azimuth]]) through use of the [[Earth's magnetic field]].  Holding the compass at waist-height, the user looks down into the mirror and lines up the target, needle, and guide line that is on the mirror.  Once all three are lined up and the compass is level, the reading for that azimuth can be made.  Arguably the most frequent use for the Brunton in the field is the calculation of the [[strike and dip]] of [[Geology|geological]] features ([[Fault (geology)|faults]], contacts, [[foliation]], [[Stratum|sedimentary strata]], etc.).  Strike is measured by leveling (with the [[bull's eye level]]) the compass along the plane being measured.  Dip is taken by laying the side of the compass perpendicular to the strike measurement and rotating horizontal level until the bubble is stable and the reading has been made.  If field conditions allow, additional features of the compass allow users to measure such geological attributes from a distance.

As with most traditional compasses, directional measurements are made in reference to the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. Thus, measurements are sensitive to magnetic intereference.  For example, if the user is near an outcrop that contains [[magnetite]] or some other [[iron]]-bearing material, compass readings can be affected anywhere from several inches from the [[outcrop]] to tens of yards away (depending on the strength of the magnetic field).  Since they are measured with a rotating [[Spirit level|level]], dip measurements are unaffected by magnetic interference.

==Other compasses==
There are numerous other compasses used by geologists: The [[Breithaupt compass]] is one example. Portable electronic devices are changing the way geologists conduct field work. Unlike analogue compasses, a digital compass relies on an accelerometer and a magnetometer, and may provide information about the reliability of a measurement (e.g. by repeating the same measurement and performing statistical analysis).

== Uses ==
# Taking a bearing
# Measuring vertical angles with clinometer
# Defining points of the same elevation
# Measuring strike and dip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Assaad|editor1-first=Fakhry A.|editor2-last=LaMoreaux|editor2-first=James W.|editor3-last=Hughes|editor3-first=Travis|title=Field Methods for Geologists and Hydrogeologists|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|pages=38–39|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=qjzvCAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Brunton%20compass&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=Brunton%20compass&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=London|date=2018-09-23|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=London&amp;oldid=860859864|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the capital of England and largest city in the United Kingdom, has a [[temperate]] [[oceanic climate]], with cool to warm summers and cold winters. While the city annually has modest [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], there are long periods of overcast skies and frequent light mist-type precipitation, which may account for the rainy image of the city.  

Within the current boundaries of Greater London, the coldest temperature ever measured was {{convert|-16.1|C}} at Northolt in January 1963, and the highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|38.1|C}}, measured at [[Kew Gardens]] during the [[European Heat Wave of 2003]]. London averages about 1600 hours of sunshine annually. London's large built-up area creates a [[microclimate]] (an "[[urban heat island]]"), with heat stored by the city's buildings. Sometimes temperatures are 5&amp;nbsp;°C (9&amp;nbsp;°F) warmer in the city than in the surrounding areas.

'''Floribunda''' (Latin for "many-flowering") is a modern group of [[garden roses]] that was developed by crossing [[Hybrid tea rose|hybrid tea]]s with [[polyantha rose]]s, the latter being derived from crosses between ''[[Rosa chinensis]]'' and ''[[Rosa multiflora]]'' (sometimes called ''R. polyantha'').&lt;ref name=PhilRix&gt;Phillips, R. and Rix, M., ''The Ultimate Guide to Roses'', Macmillan, 2004, p226&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was to create roses that bloomed with the polyantha profusion, but with hybrid tea floral beauty and colour range.

The first polyantha/hybrid tea cross, 'Rödhätte' ('Red Riding Hood'), was introduced by the Danish breeder [[Dines Poulsen]] in 1907.&lt;ref name=PhilRix/&gt; It possessed characteristics of both its parent classes, and was initially called a Hybrid Polyantha or Poulsen rose. Poulsen continued this line of work in subsequent years, introducing several Hybrid Polyanthas such as 'Else Poulsen' in 1924.&lt;ref name=PhilRix/&gt; Other breeders also began introducing similar varieties, and in 1930 the name "floribunda" was coined by Dr. J.N. Nicolas, a rose hybridizer for [[Jackson &amp; Perkins Company|Jackson &amp; Perkins]] in the US. This term has been used since then to describe [[cultivar]]s which in their ancestry have crosses between hybrid teas and polyanthas.

Typical floribundas feature stiff shrubs, smaller and bushier than the average hybrid tea but less dense and sprawling than the average polyantha. The flowers are often smaller than hybrid teas but are carried in large sprays, giving a better floral effect in the garden. Floribundas are found in all hybrid tea colours and with the classic hybrid tea-shaped blossom, sometimes differing from hybrid teas only in their cluster-flowering habit. Today they are still used in large bedding schemes in public parks and similar spaces.

[[File:Shaharah bridge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A footbridge in [[Shaharah District]], Yemen]]
A '''footbridge''' (also a '''pedestrian bridge''', '''pedestrian overpass''', or '''pedestrian overcrossing''') is a [[bridge]] designed solely for pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; While the primary meaning for a bridge is a structure which links "two points at a height above the ground", a footbridge can also be a lower structure, such as a [[boardwalk]], that enables pedestrians to cross wet, fragile, or mashy land.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; Bridges range from [[stepping stones]]–possibly the earliest man-made structure to "bridge" water–to elaborate steel structures. Another early bridge would have been simply a fallen tree. In some cases a footbridge can be both functional and a beautiful work of art. 

For rural communities in the developing world, a footbridge may be a community's only access to medical clinics, schools and markets. [[Simple suspension bridge]] designs have been developed to be [[Sustainability|sustainable]] and easily constructed in such areas using only local materials and labor.

An enclosed footbridge between two buildings is sometimes known as a [[skyway]]. Bridges providing for both pedestrians and cyclists are often referred to as [[Pedestrian separation structure|greenbridges]] and form an important part of a [[sustainable transport]] system.  

Footbridges are often situated to allow pedestrians to cross water or railways in areas where there are no nearby roads. They are also located across roads to let pedestrians cross safely without slowing traffic. The latter is a type of [[pedestrian separation structure]], examples of which are particularly found near schools.

==Early history==
[[File:Stepping Stones - geograph.org.uk - 5528.jpg|left|thumb|[[Stepping stones]], across the [[River Rothay]], in the Lake District, England]]
The simplest type of a bridge is [[stepping stones]], so this may have been one of the earliest types of footbridge. [[Neolithic]] people also built a form of a [[boardwalk]] across marshes, of which the [[Sweet Track]], and the [[Post Track]] are examples from England, that are around 6000 years old.&lt;ref Name="Current_Archaeology_somerset-levels"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brunning|first=Richard|title=The Somerset Levels|pages=139–143|volume=XV (4)|issue=172 (Special issue on Wetlands)|work=Current Archaeology|publisher=Current Archaeology|date=February 2001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undoubtedly ancient peoples would also have used [[log bridge]]s; that is a [[timber bridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=National Parks Conference| first= Department of the Interior| title=Proceedings of the National parks conference held at Berkeley, California March 11, 12, and 13, 1915| url=https://archive.org/details/proceedingsnati01confgoog| accessdate=March 14, 2010| year=1915| publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]]| location=Washington| page=60| quote=(A log bridge) is a bridge composed of log beams, the logs being in natural condition or hewn, which are thrown across two abutments, and over which traffic may pass.| ref=NPC}}&lt;/ref&gt; that fall naturally or are intentionally felled or placed across streams. Some of the first man-made bridges with significant span were probably intentionally felled trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bennett| first1=David| editor1-first=M.

Among the oldest [[timber bridge]]s is the [[Holzbrücke Rapperswil-Hurden]] crossing upper [[Lake Zürich]] in Switzerland; the prehistoric timber piles discovered to the west of the [[Seedamm]] date back to 1523 B.C. The first wooden footbridge led across [[Lake Zürich]], followed by several reconstructions at least until the late 2nd century AD, when the [[Roman Empire]] built a {{convert|6|m|ft|adj=mid|-wide}} wooden bridge. Between 1358 and 1360, [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria]], built a 'new' wooden bridge across the lake that has been used to 1878 – measuring approximately {{convert|1450|m|ft}} in length and {{convert|4|m|ft}} wide. On April 6, 2001, the reconstructed wooden footbridge was opened, being the longest wooden bridge in Switzerland. 

A [[clapper bridge]] is an ancient form of bridge found on the moors of [[Devon]] ([[Dartmoor]] and [[Exmoor]]) and in other upland areas of the United Kingdom including [[Snowdonia]] and [[Anglesey]], [[Cumbria]], [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]]. It is formed by large flat slabs of stone, often [[granite]] or [[schist]], supported on stone piers (across rivers), or resting on the banks of streams. Although often credited with prehistoric origin, most were erected in [[medieval]] times, and some in later centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A famous example is found in the village of [[Postbridge]]. First recorded in the 14th century, the bridge is believed to have been originally built in the 13th century to enable [[pack horse]]s to cross the river. Nowadays clapper bridges are only used as footbridges. 

The [[Kapellbrücke]] is a {{convert|204|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} footbridge crossing the [[Reuss (river)|River Reuss]] in the city of [[Lucerne]] in Switzerland. It is the oldest wooden covered bridge in Europe, and one of Switzerland's main tourist attractions. The bridge was originally built {{circa}} 1365&lt;ref name=LZ&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.luzernerzeitung.ch/nachrichten/zentralschweiz/luzern/Vor-20-Jahren-brannte-die-Kapellbruecke;art92,283526 |title=Vor 20 Jahren brannte die Kapellbrücke |newspaper=Luzerner Zeitung |location=Lucerne, Switzerland |date=18 August 2013 |language=de |accessdate=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of Lucerne's fortifications.

An early example of a [[skyway]] is the [[Vasari Corridor]], an elevated, enclosed passageway in [[Florence]], central [[Italy]], which connects the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] with the [[Palazzo Pitti]]. Beginning on the south side of the Palazzo Vecchio, it then joins the [[Uffizi Gallery]]  and leaves on its south side, crossing the Lungarno dei Archibusieri and then following the north bank of the [[River Arno]] until it crosses the river at [[Ponte Vecchio]]. It was built in five months by order of Duke [[Cosimo I de' Medici]] in 1565, to the design of [[Giorgio Vasari]].

[[Bank Bridge]] is a famous 25 metre long pedestrian bridge crossing the [[Griboedov Canal]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. Like other bridges across the canal, the existing structure dates from 1826. The special popularity of the bridge was gained through angular sculptures of four winged lions crowning the [[abutment]]s. They were designed by sculptor Pavel Sokolov (1764-1835), who also contributed lions for [[Bridge of Four Lions|Bridge of Lions]].

== Design ==
Design of footbridges normally follows the same principles as for other bridges. However, because they are normally significantly lighter than vehicular bridges, they are more vulnerable to [[vibration]] and therefore [[dynamic (physics)|dynamics]] effects are often given more attention in design.&lt;ref name="Schlaich"/&gt; International attention has been drawn to this issue in recent years by problems on the [[Pont de Solférino]] in Paris and the [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]] in London.

To ensure footbridges are accessible to [[disability|disabled]] and other mobility-impaired people, careful consideration is nowadays also given to provision of access [[elevator|lifts]] or [[Wheelchair ramp|ramps]], as required by relevant legislation (e.g. [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] in the UK).&lt;ref name="Schlaich"&gt;Schlaich, Mike, et al., ''Guidelines for the Design of Footbridges'', International Federation for Structural Concrete, 2005, {{ISBN|2-88394-072-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some old bridges in Venice are now equipped with a [[stairlift]] so that residents with a disability can cross them.

==Types==
[[File:Passerelle ruisseau Moulin-Haut.jpg|thumb|A simple French footbridge]]
Types of footbridges include:
* [[Beam Bridge]]
* [[Boardwalk]]
* [[Clapper bridge]]
* [[Duckboards]], [[Timber trackway]], [[Plank road]], and [[Corduroy road]]
* [[Moon bridge]]
* [[Simple suspension bridge]]
* [[Truss|Simple truss]]
* [[Stepping stones]]
* [[Zig-zag bridge]]

The residential-scale footbridges all [[Span (architecture)|span]] a short distance and can be used for a broad range of applications. Complicated [[engineering]] is not needed and the footbridges are built with readily available materials and basic tools.&lt;ref name="Jeswald"&gt;Jeswald, P. (2005). ''How to build paths, steps &amp; Footbridges''. North Adams, Massachusetts: Storey Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different types of design footbridges include:
* [[Timber]] footbridges
* [[Steel]] footbridges
* [[Concrete]] footbridge

Footbridges can also be built in the same ways as road or rail bridges; particularly [[suspension bridge]]s and [[beam bridge]]s. Some former road bridges have had their traffic diverted to alternative crossings and have become pedestrian bridges; examples in the UK include [[The Iron Bridge]] at [[Ironbridge]], [[Shropshire]], the [[Old Bridge, Pontypridd|Old Bridge]] at [[Pontypridd]] and [[Windsor Bridge]] at [[Windsor, Berkshire]].

Most footbridges are equipped with [[guard rail]]s to reduce the risk of pedestrians falling. Where they pass over busy roads or railways, they may also include a fence or [[suicide barrier|other such barrier]] to prevent pedestrians from jumping, or throwing projectiles onto the traffic below.
=== Railways ===
[[File:Tilak Nagar Station, Mumbai.jpg|left|thumb|Tilak Nagar Station in [[Mumbai]]]]
It was originally usual for passengers to cross from one [[railway platform]] to another by stepping over the tracks, but from the mid-19th century onwards safety demanded the provision of a footbridge (or [[subway (underpass)|underpass]]) at busier places. However, in some quieter areas, crossing the line by walking over the tracks is possible.

=== Catwalk ===
Narrow footbridges or walkways to allow workers access to parts of a structure otherwise difficult to reach are referred as  '''catwalks''' or '''cat walks'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.boothkoskoff.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/leavitt2.pdf |title=Negligence Petroleum storage tank exploded |date=July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such catwalks are located above a stage ([[Catwalk (theater)|theater catwalk]]) in a theater, between parts of a building, along the side of a bridge, on the inside of a tunnel, on the outside of any large [[storage tank]] in a [[Oil refinery|refinery]] or elsewhere, etc. The walkway on the outside (top) of a [[railroad car]]s such as [[boxcar]]s, before [[railway air brake|air brakes]] came into use, or on top of some [[covered hopper]] cars is also called a '''catwalk'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webster-dictionary.net/definition/catwalk|title=catwalk|work=webster-dictionary.net|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of those on top of railroad cars, catwalks are equipped with [[Guard rail|railings]] or [[handrail]]s.

== In developing countries ==
Since the early 1980s, several charities have developed standardized footbridge designs that are [[sustainable]] for use in [[developing countries]]. The first charity to develop such designs was Helvetas, located in Zurich, Switzerland.&lt;ref name="helvetas1"&gt;[http://www.helvetas.ch/nepal/wEnglish/projects/TBSU/tbsu.asp?navid=16] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503094258/http://www.helvetas.ch/nepal/wEnglish/projects/TBSU/tbsu.asp?navid=16 |date=May 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Designs that can be sustainably and efficiently used in developing countries are typically made available to the public gratis.

== Long footbridges ==
[[File:Walkway Over the Hudson 4.JPG|thumb|A section of the [[Poughkeepsie Bridge]], New York State, USA.]]

The record for the longest footbridge in the world was claimed by the NY State Governor David Paterson in an Oct. 3, 2009 Poughkeepsie Journal article about The Walkway [[Poughkeepsie Bridge]] across the [[Hudson River]] at [[Poughkeepsie, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WALKWAY OPENS, THOUSANDS EXPLORE UNIQUE STATE PARK |newspaper=[[Poughkeepsie Journal]] |location=[[Poughkeepsie, New York]] |date=October 3, 2009 |url=http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091003/QUAD/91003006 |accessdate=2009-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111932/http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20091003%2FQUAD%2F91003006 |archivedate=April 2, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 22, 2017, the [[Champlain Bridge Ice Structure, or "l'Estacade Champlain" in French]], a bridge built for bicycles and foot traffic only to parallel the Champlain Bridge from Brossard, Quebec west to Nun's Island (L'ile Des Soeurs) &amp; the Island of Montreal, was measured by a calibrated device as being 7,512 feet (2,292 meters) long or 1.4227 miles or 2.292km, starting and ending where the treadway rises above the ground and a pedestrian could access the bridge as close as possible to the St Lawrence River.

The Walkway Over The Hudson footbridge was originally built for trains, it was recently restored as a pedestrian walkway.  The footbridge has a total length of 2,063 meters (6,768 feet).  Before it was demolished in 2011, the [[Hornibrook Bridge]] which crossed [[Bramble Bay]] in [[Queensland]], Australia was longer than the Poughkeepsie Bridge at 2.8&amp;nbsp;km (1.7&amp;nbsp;mi).&lt;ref&gt;[http://northside-chronicle.whereilive.com.au/your-news/story/final-curtain-for-the-hornibrook-highway/ Final Curtain for the Hornibrook Highway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706113432/http://northside-chronicle.whereilive.com.au/your-news/story/final-curtain-for-the-hornibrook-highway/ |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
Much rural travel takes place on local [[footpath]]s, tracks and village roads. These provide essential access to water, firewood, farm plots and the classified road network. Communities and/or local government are generally responsible for this [[infrastructure]].{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;ref name="Dennis"&gt;Dennis, R. (2004). [http://www.ittransport.co.uk/documents/footbridge%20brochure.pdf "Foot Bridges"]. Retrieved June 25, 2010  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715122545/http://www.ittransport.co.uk/documents/footbridge%20brochure.pdf |date=July 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
Pedestrian overpasses over highways or railroads are expensive, especially when elevators or long ramps for wheelchair users are required. Without elevators or ramps, people with mobility handicaps will not be able to use the structure. People may prefer to walk across a busy road  rather than climb a bridge. It is recommended that overpasses should only be used where the number of users justify the costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walkinginfo.org/engineering/crossings-overpasses.cfm |title=Pedestrian Overpasses/Underpasses |publisher=Pedestrian Bicycle Information Center |accessdate=2013-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604031027/http://www.walkinginfo.org/engineering/crossings-overpasses.cfm |archivedate=2013-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrow, enclosed structures can result in perceptions of low personal security among users. Wider structures and good lighting can help reduce this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.pdx.edu/~jdill/Files/Renfro_Bike-Ped_Overcrossings_Report.pdf, |title=Pedestrian/Bicycle Overcrossings: Lessons Learned |author=Rory Renfro |date=June 2007 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1082">'''Ganz province''' (also known as Ganazo or Ganzo) was a region surrounding what is now the capital region and city of [[Addis Ababa]] in [[Ethiopia]].

==Islamic state==
Originally an Islamic state ruled by a Garad,&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha pg. 686&lt;/ref&gt; Ganz was part of the unsuccessful Islamic alliance that opposed [[Amda Seyon I]] in the 1320s. The polity allied with the [[Sultanate of Adal]] again in Ahmedudin Badlay's war to retake [[Dawaro Sultanate|Dawaro]] from Abyssinian control, but Ganz was defeated and became an Abyssinian province.

Imam [[Ahmed Gurey]]'s forces recaptured Ganz during his jihad, but the territory returned to Abyssinian control soon after his death.

==End of Ganz==
Ganz was occupied in the [[Oromo migrations]] by the Tulama Oromo, though the territory was conquered in the 19th century by the Kingdom of [[Shewa]], who made [[Addis Ababa]] their capital. Shewa went on to unify the country into Ethiopia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6618">The '''geology of Cameroon''' is almost universally [[Precambrian]] metamorphic and igneous basement rock, formed in the [[Archean]] as part of the [[Congo Craton]] and the [[Central African Mobile Zone]] and covered in [[laterite]], recent sediments and soils. Some parts of the country have sequences of sedimentary rocks from the [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]] as well as volcanic rock produced by the 1600 kilometer [[Cameroon Volcanic Line]], which includes the still-active [[Mount Cameroon]]. The country is notable for gold, diamonds and some onshore and offshore oil and gas.

==Stratigraphy &amp; Geologic History==
The basement rocks in Cameroon are divided between the [[Central African Mobile Zone (CAMZ)]] and the [[Congo Craton]], a section of ancient, stable continental crust.

===Archean===
The Congo Craton formed over two billion years ago in the [[Archean]] and covers much of southern Cameroon. In the south, it is referred to as the [[Ntem Group]] and contains [[gneiss]], [[granite]] and [[charnockite]]. The CAMZ also dates to the Archean and includes [[mica]] [[schist]], [[migmatite]] [[gneiss]] with [[plagioclase]] and migmatites intruded by [[quartz]], [[granodiorite]] and [[diorite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paleozoic-Mesozoic (541-66 million years ago)===
The [[Mangbei Basin]], [[Douala Basin]] and [[Rio-del-Rey Basin]] formed in CAMZ and filled with [[Early Paleozoic]] volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The Douala and Rio-del-Rey basins both formed as a result of the breakup of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]] and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean.

The [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] and [[sandstone]] of [[Mudeck Formation]] probably formed in the [[Early Cretaceous]] and is overlain by fossil-bearing shale. There is an [[unconformity]] between the crystalline basement rock and the Mudeck Formation. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=58}}

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
During the [[Cenozoic]], Cameroon experienced igneous activity related to the [[Cameroon Volcanic Line]]. More than 60 sub-volcanic ring complexes formed, one to 10 kilometers in diameter and made up of [[syenite]] and [[granite]]. Geologists have dated ring complexes to as far back as 66 million years ago or as recently 30 million years ago and they may represent heavily eroded remnants of earlier volcanoes, that intruded through metamorphic basement rock into early Cenozoic sediments. Known as Granites Ultimes, these ring complexes extend over a span of 1000 kilometers parallel to the Cameroon Volcanic Line, which stretches from the interior of Africa to [[Pagalu]] in the [[Gulf of Guinea]].

[[Mount Cameroon]] is the southernmost volcano on the continental extent of the line and has erupted within recent years. There are no sedimentary rocks in central Cameroon and they are only present in the north and south. With tectonic activity in the Cenozoic related to the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, the Douala and Rio-del-Rey basins formed a continuous sedimentary basin from Nigeria to southern Cameroon until the [[Miocene]].

Some of the youngest sediments in Cameroon are located in the Lake Chad basin, dating to the past 2.5 million years of the [[Quaternary]]. Even more recent [[Holocene]] sediments cover much of the landscape, forming soils and alluvial material in rivers. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=58-60}}

==Structural Geology &amp; Tectonics==
The CAMZ is divided by the [[Foumban Shear Zone]]. The Douala Basin is defined by northeast-southwest strike-slip faults and was divided from the Rio-del-Rey basin by volcanic activity. The Cameroon Volcanic Line formed along the preexisting [[Central African Shear Zone]], which cuts through the [[Adamawa Uplift]]. The [[Benue Trough]] is a major tectonic feature in the north of Cameroon. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=60}}

==Hydrogeology==
Virtually all groundwater in much of Cameroon is sourced from a combination of thin layers of unconsolidated alluvium, [[laterite]] soils and underlying fractured Precambrian crystalline basement rock, between eight and 20 meters thick. Small springs, including some thermal springs are found in the fractured bedrock around volcanoes.
 
Cenozoic sediments from the [[Pliocene]] and the [[Quaternary]] form a key aquifer in the Douala Basin. During the dry season, the water table sometimes falls resulting in seawater intrusion. The [[Garoua Basin]] and [[Lake Chad Basin Aquifer]] are also important water supplies, often with Cretaceous sandstones at the base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=Hydrogeology of Cameroon|publisher=British Geological Survey|url=http://earthwise.bgs.ac.uk/index.php/Hydrogeology_of_Cameroon#Hydrogeology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural hazards==
Mount Cameroon is the only active volcano in the country, but has erupted frequently in recent history, including seven times in the 20th century destroying plantations and parts of the surrounding landscape in 1909, 1922, 1959, 1982, 1999 and 2000. Cameroon has very active and dangerous crater lakes that accumulate and periodically release [[carbon dioxide]] causing the mass death during the [[Lake Nyos disaster]] in 1986, which killed 1700 people, as well as the deadly 1984 release at [[Lake Mounoun]] which killed 37. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=60}}

==Natural resource geology==
Artisanal mining has targeted alluvial diamonds in the Series de Carnot, a group of river and lake formations from the Cretaceous along the border with the [[Central African Republic]]. Gold is common across the country in crystalline basement rock, particularly in the east.

There is a small [[cassiterite]] deposit at Mayo Darle in northwest Cameroon, nickel and cobalt near Lomie and [[rutile]] that was mined until 1957 near [[Yaounde]]. Cameroon has two large [[bauxite]] deposits in Ngaoundal and the [[Minim-Martap Complex]]I in the south, along with Fongo-Tongo in the west. Iron ore, with an iron concentration between 30 and 40% are situated near Mbalam in the southwest and at Kribi on the coast. Local cement plants exploit limestone deposits at Figuil and there is some marble close to Bidzar in the north. The [[Djoungo quarry]] extracts [[pozzolana]].

Cameroon has small oil and gas reserves, extracted near Victoria on the north coast, as well as offshore on the [[Mokoko-Abana Oilfield]]. {{sfn|Schluter|2014|p=60}}

'''Gezira''' is an island in the [[Nile River]], in central [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. The southern portion of the island contains the Gezira district, and the northern third contains the [[Zamalek]] district.

Gezira is west of [[downtown Cairo]] and [[Tahrir Square]], connected across the Nile by three bridges each on the east and west sides, including the [[Qasr El Nil Bridge]] and [[6th October Bridge]]. Under 19th century ruler [[Khedive Ismail]] the island was first called "Jardin des Plantes" (French for "Garden of Plants"), because of its great collection of [[exotic plants]] shipped from all over the world.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-dar.com/html/Zamalekhistory.html |title=Zamalek Today |accessdate=15 June 2010 |work=e-dar.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221154/http://www.e-dar.com/html/Zamalekhistory.html |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gillian Rose''' [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (born 1962) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[geographer]] and  geographic author. She is a professor of human geography in the School of Geography and the Environment at the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/grose.html|title=Academic Staff: School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, she taught and served as Associate Dean at [[Open University|The Open University]]. She is best known for her 1993 book, ''Feminism &amp; Geography: The Limits of Geographical Knowledge''. 

== Education and early career==

Rose earned her BA from the [[University of Cambridge]] and her PhD (1990) from the [[University of London]]. She also has taught at the [[University of London]] and [[University of Edinburgh]]. Before joining the faculty of the School of Geography and the Environment at the [[University of Oxford]] in 2017, she previously taught and served as Associate Dean (Research) in the Faculty of Social Sciences at [[Open University|The Open University]] and was also Head of the Geography Department there for four years.  

==Scholarly contributions==
:: ''"I think one of geography's greatest strengths-- one if its greatest pleasures-- as a discipline, is the way that it gathers together very different talents and skills, and puts them to work together in the task of understanding the world we all share."''-- Professor Gillian Rose's acceptance speech from the 2012 Royal Geographical Society Medals and Awards ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Palin, Michael et al (2012) Geography as a shared project: Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) Medals and Awards ceremony 2012.  ''The Geographical Journal'' '''178'''(3) pp.279-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose's current research interests lie broadly within the field of [[visual culture]]. She is interested in the ways social subjectivities and relations are pictured or made invisible in a range of [[Published media|media]], and how those processes are embedded in power relations. She also has long-standing interest in [[feminist film theory]] and in [[Michel Foucault]]'s and [[feminist]] accounts of [[photography]] in particular. This work has formed a crucial link between [[feminist geography]] and [[geography of media and communication]].

Written from a [[Marxist]] and [[radical feminist]] perspective, ''Feminism &amp; Geography'' stimulated a series of debates within geography about the nature of how geographic knowledge is constructed.  Rose is known for defining identity as "how we make sense of ourselves" and explained how we each have different identities on different scales, for example, someone's local identity is probably different from their global identity.  She also describes sense of place as the process of infusing a place with "meaning and feeling."

In recent years she has written three books that have proven less controversial: ''Visual Methodologies: An Introduction to Interpreting Visual Materials'' (2001), ''Deterritorialisations: Revisioning Landscape and Politics'' (2003), and ''Doing Family Photography: The Domestic, The Public and The Politics of Sentiment'' (Ashgate, 2012).

The '''Governor of Tasmania''' is the representative in the [[Australia]]n state of [[Tasmania]] of [[Elizabeth II]], [[Queen of Australia]]. The Governor performs the same constitutional and ceremonial functions at the state level as the [[Governor-General of Australia]] does at the national level.

In accordance with the conventions of the [[Westminster system]] of parliamentary government, the Governor nearly always acts solely on the [[Advice (constitutional)|advice]] of the head of the elected government, the [[Premier of Tasmania]]. Nevertheless, the Governor retains the [[reserve powers]] of the Crown, and has the right to dismiss the Premier.

See [[Governors of the Australian states]] for a description and history of the office of governor.

The official residence of the Governor is [[Government House, Hobart|Government House]] located at the [[Queens Domain]].

The first Australian-born Governor of Tasmania was [[Stanley Burbury|Sir Stanley Burbury]] (appointed 1973).  The first Tasmanian-born governor was [[Guy Green (judge)|Sir Guy Green]] (appointed 1995).  Since Burbury, all Tasmanian governors have been Australian-born, except for [[Peter Underwood]], who was born in Britain but emigrated to Australia when a teenager. The position was vacant for over five months in 2014, due to the unexpected death of the incumbent Peter Underwood on 7 July, with Chief Justice and Lieutenant-Governor [[Alan Blow]] acting as Administrator. On 10 November, Premier Will Hodgman announced that University of Tasmania legal academic [[Kate Warner]] would be appointed as the state's first female governor.&lt;ref name=kwarner&gt;{{cite news|title=Kate Warner to be appointed 28th Tasmanian Governor|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-10/28th-tasmanian-governor-announced-kate-warner/5878872|accessdate=10 November 2014|work=ABC News|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner was sworn in on 10 December.

As from the appointment of Kate Warner as governor in December 2014, The Queen, upon the recommendation of the Premier, accorded Professor Warner, and all future Governors, the title 'The Honourable' for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tasmanian Gazette |url=http://www.gazette.tas.gov.au/editions/2014/december_2014/21486_-_Special_10_December_2014.pdf|date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divided in two==
Between 1804 and 1813, [[Van Diemen's Land]] was divided along the 42nd parallel, and the two sections governed as separate "Lieutenant-Governorships" under the [[Governor of New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/governor/pastgovs.html Past Governors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617194420/http://www.dpac.tas.gov.au/governor/pastgovs.html |date=2006-06-17 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID%3D69 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403174545/http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=69 |archivedate=2007-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins was the only officially appointed Lieutenant-Governor—upon his death in 1810, the government in Hobart Town was administered, by the Commandants at Hobart Town (Lord, Murray and Geils). The northern settlement at Port Dalrymple (now [[George Town, Tasmania|George Town]]) was administered by four Commandants until the settlements were merged to form the single colony under the governorship of [[Thomas Davey (governor)|Thomas Davey]] in 1813.&lt;ref name=widowson&gt;Widowson, Henry: ''Present State of Van Diemen's Land'', 1829.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the island's first map, drawn by one of the country's earliest settlers, Captain John Swan, around 1640, the area was shown as "Spykeses Bay" and many Barbadians have pronounced it "Spykestown" ever since. The town was a bustling seaport, and for many years, and carried on such a thriving trade with Bristol in England that it called "Little Bristol".

'''WorldWind''' is an [[open source software|open-source]] (released under the [[NASA Open Source Agreement|NOSA]] license) [[virtual globe]].  It was first developed by [[NASA]] in 2003 for use on [[personal computer]]s and then further developed in concert with the [[free software movement|open source community]] since 2004. As of 2017, a web based version of WorldWind is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explorer.worldwind.earth/|website=explorer.worldwind.earth|title=World Wind Explorer}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version is also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindAndroid|title=WorldWindAndroid github repository}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original version relied on [[.NET Framework]], which ran only on [[Microsoft Windows]]. The more recent [[Java (programming language)|Java]] version, WorldWind Java, is cross platform, a [[software development kit]] (SDK) aimed at [[Software developer|developers]] and, unlike the old .NET version, not a standalone [[virtual globe]] [[Application software|application]] in the style of [[Google Earth]]. The SDK includes a suite of basic demos, available at goworldwind.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goworldwind.org/|title=goworldwind.org|work=goworldwind.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WorldWind Java version was awarded NASA Software of the Year in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/icb/winners/soy/ |website=nasa.gov |date=December 24, 2009 |volume= 2, Issue 12 |title=Software of the Year Award, WorldWind Java}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program overlays NASA and [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] [[satellite imagery]], [[aerial photography]], [[topographic maps]], [[Keyhole Markup Language]] (KML) and [[Collada]] files.

==Overview==
Though widely available since 2003, WorldWind was released with the NASA Open Source Agreement license in 2004. The latest Java-based version (2.1.0), was released in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindJava/releases/tag/v2.1.0 |title=v2.1.0 | accessdate= April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015 a web based version of WorldWind is under development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WebWorldWind |title= NASA WorldWind in JavaScript for HTML5 | accessdate= April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://explorer.worldwind.earth/|title=World Wind Explorer|first=Bruce|last=Schubert|website=explorer.worldwind.earth}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version is also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/NASAWorldWind/WorldWindAndroid/releases/tag/v0.1.0 |title=NASAWorldWind/WorldWindAndroid | accessdate= April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous .NET-based version was an application with an extensive suite of plugins. Apart from the Earth there are several worlds: [[Moon]], [[Mars]], [[Venus]],  [[Jupiter]] (with the four [[Galilean moons]] of [[Io (moon)|Io]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]]) and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] (imagery of stars and galaxies).

Users could interact with the selected planet by rotating it, tilting the view, and zooming in and out. Five million place names, political boundaries, latitude/longitude lines, and other data can be displayed. WorldWind.NET provided the ability to browse maps and [[geospatial]] data on the internet using the [[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]]'s [[Web Map Service|WMS]] servers (version 1.4 also uses [[Web Feature Service|WFS]] for downloading place names), import [[ESRI shapefiles]] and [[Keyhole Markup Language|kml/kmz]] files. This is an example of how WorldWind allows anyone to deliver their data.

Other features of WorldWind.NET included support for .X ([[DirectX]] 3D polygon mesh) models and advanced visual effects such as atmospheric [[scattering]] or [[shaded relief|sun shading]].

The resolution inside the US is high enough to clearly discern individual buildings, houses, cars (USGS Digital Ortho layer) and even the shadows of people (metropolitan areas in USGS Urban Ortho layer). The resolution outside the US is at least 15 meters per pixel.

[[Microsoft]] has allowed WorldWind to incorporate [[Virtual Earth]] high resolution data for [[non-commercial]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwindcentral.com/wiki/Virtual_Earth|title=Virtual Earth|work=worldwindcentral.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WorldWind uses [[digital elevation model]] (DEM) data collected by NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), [[National Elevation Dataset]] (NED) and [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer]] (ASTER). This means one can view topographic features such as the Grand Canyon or Mount Everest in three dimensions. In addition, WW has [[bathymetry]] data which allows users to see ocean features, such as [[Oceanic trench|trenches]] and [[Mid-ocean ridge|ridges]], in 3D.

Many people using the applications are adding their own data and are making them available through various sources, such as the WorldWind Central or blogs mentioned in the link section below.

All images and movies created with WorldWind using Blue Marble, Landsat, or USGS [[public domain]] data can be freely modified, re-distributed, and used on web sites, even for commercial purposes.

==Add-ons and plugins==
WorldWind can be expanded by using one of many add-ons - small extensions that add new functionality to the program.&lt;br&gt;
Possible types of add-ons:
*Point layers - simple [[XML]] files displaying placemarks (point of interest) as icons
*Trail layers - paths (routes, boundaries)
*Line features - XML with a list of points visualized as a line or wall
*Polygon features - XML with a list of points visualized as a filled [[polygon]] (flat or [[extrusion|extruded]])
*Model features - XML used to load 3D textured meshes
*Place names - specific points (such as cities, hills and buildings) that are assigned text labels
*Image layers - high resolution imagery for various places in the world
*Scripts - files that control camera movement
Plugins are small programs written in [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Visual Basic|VB]] or [[J Sharp|J#]] which are loaded and compiled by WorldWind at startup. Plug-in developers can add features to WorldWind without changing the program's source code.

==WorldWind Java==
The original recipe for WorldWind was restricted to Windows, relying on the [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] libraries and [[DirectX]]. A new [[Software development kit|SDK]] version has been developed in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] with [[Java OpenGL|JOGL]] referred to as WorldWind Java. The latest version (2.1.0) was released in December 2016.

This new version has an [[API]]-centric architecture with functionalities 'off-loaded' to modular components, leaving the API at the core. This makes WorldWind itself a plugin, so that it can be used as interchangeably as possible (for example via [[Python (programming language)|Python]]). This refactoring exercise allows WorldWind to be accessed via a browser as a Java Applet. A preview of the WorldWind Java SDK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goworldwind.org/demos/|title=Demos|work=goworldwind.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released on May 11, 2007 during Sun Microsystem's annual [[JavaOne]] conference.

Since WWj is an SDK, there is no single application; instead there are any number of applications using WWj, each with different functionalities, created by government agencies and commercial developers from around the world. These applications include simple virtual globe viewers, satellite tracker, [[GIS]] platforms, photo editor, F-16 simulator, mission planning software and many more.

==Tutorials==
* '''NASA WorldWind SDK Tutorial''':[https://web.archive.org/web/20121224015417/http://ifgi.uni-muenster.de/worldwind-tutorial/] This Tutorial was developed by the Institute for Geoinformatics from the [[University of Münster]], Germany. It contains tutorials from setting up an Eclipse environment with the WorldWind API to building polygons from [[Linked Open Data]] geographic datasets. It contains important tips from beginners to advanced developers.

==Forks and clones==
*'''Geoforge project'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geoforge.org/|title=Geoforge - home|author=Geoforge project|work=geoforge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the NASA WorldWind project. Geoforge provides open source software. It leads in a platform&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geoforge.org/prt/software_platform.html|title=Geoforge - software platform|author=Geoforge project|work=geoforge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; that manages geosciences data and uses WorldWind features to provide a display of geo-localised geosciences objects.
*'''Dapple'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dapple.geosoft.com/|title=Dapple Earth Explorer: Map and View the Earth|work=geosoft.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813000458/http://dapple.geosoft.com/|archivedate=2006-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the NASA WorldWind project, it is an Open Source project created by developers at [[Geosoft]]. Dapple is aimed at [[geoscience]] professionals, and has features aimed at them, such as easy addition of WMS servers and a simpler [[user interface|UI]] very similar to Google Earth's.
*'''SERVIR-VIZ'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iagt.org/servir/servir_viz/|title=Downloads - IAGT, The Institute for the Application of Geospatial Technology, Auburn, New York|work=iagt.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a customized version of WorldWind developed by IAGT for the SERVIR project.
*WW2D was a cross-platform, free and open-source application based on [[Java platform|Java]] and [[OpenGL]] technologies and can be run on Microsoft Windows, [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]] ([[x86]] and [[x86-64]]) and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] on [[SPARC]]. WW2D uses images from WorldWind's servers.
**WW2D Plus One - an update to WW2D providing a 3D view.
*Punt was a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the NASA WorldWind project, and was started by two members of the [[free software community]] who had made contributions to WorldWind. Punt was based on the code in WorldWind 1.3.2, but its initial release has features not found in WorldWind 1.3.2 or 1.3.3 (such as support for multiple languages). Currently, Punt is only available for Windows, but long-term goals include a desire to move to a cross-platform solution.

==Datasets available==
Low resolution Blue Marble datasets are included with the initial [[download]]; as a user zooms into certain areas, additional high resolution data is downloaded from the NASA [[Server (computing)|server]]s. The size of all currently available data sets is about 4.6 [[terabytes]].

'''Old Herzegovina''' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Стара Херцеговина/''Stara Hercegovina'') is a [[history|historical]] [[region]] in [[Montenegro]]. The term also refers to the southern most tip of the [[Herzegovina]] region in neighboring [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/bs/safari-kroz-hercegovinu/g-39852160|title=Safari kroz Hercegovinu {{!}} Svi sadržaji {{!}} DW {{!}} 28.07.2017|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=bs|access-date=2017-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area includes part of present-day Montenegro, with the coastal area of [[Herceg Novi]], the region around [[Nikšić]], and the mountainous area spanning towards [[Pljevlja]]. The area is also assumed to include [[Prijepolje]], which is currently in [[Serbia]], and the areas around [[Foča]], [[Kalinovik]], and [[Goražde]], which are today included in the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

The name comes from the medieval [[Duchy of St. Sava]], established by ''herzog'' [[Stefan Vukčić Kosača]] within the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]], and the Ottoman-era [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]]. Between 1580 and 1867, Herzegovina was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]], and briefly part of [[Herzegovina Eyalet]] (1833–1851), of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The eastern portion of Herzegovina was annexed to the [[Principality of Montenegro]] after the [[Congress of Berlin]] (1878), while the rest was established the [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] under Austro-Hungarian rule.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10611">The [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] was an attempt to cross the [[Antarctica|Antarctic continent]] led by [[Ernest Shackleton]]. The personnel were divided into two groups: the Weddell Sea party consisting of the men who would attempt the crossing and their support, and the [[Ross Sea party]] whose job it was to lay stores on the far side of the Pole for the members of the Weddell Sea party who would make the crossing. Both arms of the expedition had a final complement of 28 men. The Weddell Sea party's ship ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'' was crushed in pack ice and the crossing attempt was never made. All the Weddell Sea party were rescued, but several members of the Ross Sea party perished after their support ship ''[[SY Aurora|Aurora]]'' broke free from its mooring and drifted, leaving the shore party stranded.

Names and dates of birth are included where known. After ''Endurance'' was lost, the Weddell Sea party spent some months camped on the ice before making for [[Elephant Island]] in the three lifeboats salvaged from the vessel, the ''[[James Caird (ship)|James Caird]]'', the ''Dudley Docker'' and the ''Stancomb Wills''. The boat each man was assigned to for the crossing is listed.

Some of the original crew left the expedition to sign up when [[World War I|war was declared with Germany]],{{efn|Among these were Douglas George Jeffrey, who later joined Shackleton's [[Shackleton–Rowett Expedition|final expedition]]; Courtney Brocklehurst and F. Dobbs who would have been in charge of the dog sections; and V. Studd, the original geologist.}} and others returned to England after the ship put in at [[Buenos Aires]].

'''Photomapping''' involves the process of drawing a map from a photographic base. "In all likelihood, computer map making, including analogue processing, will have replaced manual map making for well over 90 per cent of all maps".&lt;ref name=Robinson_et_al1977_16&gt;Robinson et al. (1977:16)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles and Definitions==
Photomapping is the process of making a map with "cartographic enhancements"&lt;ref name=Petrie1977_50&gt;Petrie (1977: 50)&lt;/ref&gt; that have been drawn from a [[photographic mosaic|photomosaic]]&lt;ref name=Petrie1977_49&gt;Petrie (1977: 49)&lt;/ref&gt; that is "a composite photographic image of the ground" or more precisely as a controlled photomosaic where "individual photographs are rectified for tilt and brought to a common scale (at least at certain control points)."

Rectification of imagery is generally achieved by "fitting the projected images of each photograph to a set of four control points whose positions have been derived from an existing map or from ground measurements. When these rectified, scaled photographs are positioned on a grid of control points, a good correspondence can be achieved between them through skillful trimming and fitting and the use of the areas around the principal point where the relief displacements (which cannot be removed) are at a minimum."&lt;ref name=Petrie1977_50&gt;Petrie (1977: 50)&lt;/ref&gt;

"It is quite reasonable to conclude that some form of photomap will become the standard general map of the future." &lt;ref name=Robinson_et_al1977_10&gt;Robinson et al. (1977:10)&lt;/ref&gt; go on to suggest that, "photomapping would appear to be the only way to take reasonable advantage" of future data sources like high altitude aircraft and satellite imagery.
The highest resolution aerial photomaps on GoogleEarth are approximately 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm spatial resolution images.
The highest resolution photomap of ortho images was made in Hungary in 2012 with a 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm spatial resolution.

==Photomapping in Archaeology==

Demonstrating the link between [[orthophotomap]]ping and [[archaeology]],&lt;ref name=Estes_et_al1977_10&gt;Estes et al. (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; historic [[aerial photography|airphotos]] photos were used to aid in developing a reconstruction of the Ventura mission that guided excavations of the structure's walls.

Overhead photography has been widely applied for mapping surface remains and excavation exposures at archaeological sites. Suggested platforms for capturing these photographs has included: War Balloons from World War I;&lt;ref name=Capper_1907&gt;Capper (1907)&lt;/ref&gt; rubber meteorological balloons;&lt;ref name=Guy_1932&gt;Guy (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; [[kite aerial photography|kites]];&lt;ref name=Guy_1932&gt;Guy (1932)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bascom_1941&gt;Bascom (1941)&lt;/ref&gt; wooden platforms, metal frameworks, constructed over an excavation exposure;&lt;ref name=Guy_1932&gt;Guy (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; ladders both alone and held together with poles or planks; three legged ladders; single and multi-section poles;&lt;ref name=Schwartz_1964&gt;Schwartz (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wiltshire_1967&gt;Wiltshire (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; bipods;&lt;ref name=Kriegler_1928&gt;Kriegler (1928)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hampl_1957&gt;Hampl (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Whittlesey_1966&gt;Whittlesey (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fant_Loy_1972&gt;Fant and Loy (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; tripods;&lt;ref name=Straffin_1971&gt;Straffin (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; tetrapods&lt;ref name=Simpson_Cooke1967&gt;Simpson and Cooke (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hume_1969&gt;Hume (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; aerial bucket trucks ("cherry pickers"),&lt;ref name=Sterud_Pratt_1975&gt;Sterud and Pratt (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; and light weight individuals dangling from the limb of a nearby tree.

'''Japanese place names''' include [[Toponym|names]] for geographic features, present and former administrative divisions, transportation facilities such as railroad stations, and historic sites in [[Japan]]. The article [[Japanese addressing system]] contains related information on postal addresses.

==Administrative level==
Most place names are suffixed with its administrative division.  These suffixes are often dropped in common usage when no ambiguation is likely.  The suffixes are as follows:

* ''-ken'' (県) for a [[prefectures of Japan|prefecture]]; e.g., [[Yamanashi Prefecture|Yamanashi]]-ken
* ''-to'' (都, lit. "capital"), prefecture-level region name unique to the capital [[Tōkyō]]-to
* ''-fu'' (府, lit. "office" or "area"), prefecture-level region (sometimes translated "urban prefecture") named so for historical reasons. There are now only two: [[Osaka Prefecture|Ōsaka]]-fu and [[Kyoto Prefecture|Kyōto]]-fu. Tokyo-to was also classified as this before being reorganized.
* ''dō'' (道), an "[[administrative circuit]]", a semi-archaic administrative division formerly widespread.  Modern usage is limited to [[Hokkaido]], but terms like [[Tōkaidō (region)|Tōkaidō]] (southern portion of eastern Japan) remains in common informal usage.

Because of the above four suffixes, the [[prefectures of Japan]] are commonly referred to as ''todōfuken'' (都道府県). And below the level of prefectures, there are:

* ''-gun'' (郡), a [[Districts of Japan|district]], usually rural. The [[Japanese addressing system|Japanese postal service]] and many other sources translate this as ''[[county]]''.
* ''-shi'' (市), a [[municipality of Japan|city]]
* ''-ku'' (区), a ward of a city; ''e.g.'', [[Naka-ku, Hiroshima|Naka-ku]] in [[Hiroshima]]. The [[23 special wards]] of Tokyo are separate local governments nearly equivalent to cities.
* ''-machi'' or ''-chō'' (町), a [[towns of Japan|town]] - this can be a local government or a non-governmental division of a larger city
* ''-mura'' or ''-son'' (村), a [[villages of Japan|village]]; ''e.g.'', [[Kamikuishiki, Yamanashi|Kamikuishiki]]-mura - this can also be a local government or a nongovernmental division of a larger city or town

==Direction==
Some names contain a word indicating a direction:
* ''chūō'' (中央) or ''naka-'' (中) - central; e.g., [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]] Chūō; Naka-Okachimachi
* ''higashi'' (東) - east
* ''kita'' (北) - north; e.g., Kita-ku, literally meaning North Ward
* ''minami'' (南) - south
* ''nishi'' (西) - west
* ''u'' (右) ("right") and ''sa'' (左) ("left"), directions relative to the [[Kyoto Gosho|Kyōto Imperial Palace]] (and from the viewpoint of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]], who faces south, so that ''sa'' is east and ''u'' is west): [[Sakyo-ku, Kyoto|Sakyō-ku]], [[Ukyo-ku, Kyoto|Ukyō-ku]]

==Relationship==
Other names contain a word indicating the relationship of a settlement to another of the same or a similar name:
* ''hon'' or ''moto'' (本) - the original; e.g., [[Fuchu, Tokyo|Fuchu]] Honmachi; Moto [[Hachiōji, Tokyo|Hachiōji]]
* ''shin'' (新) - new

==Geographic features==
Geographic features figure prominently in Japanese place names. Some examples are{{sfn|Frédéric|Roth|2002|p=695}}
* ''hama'' (浜) for a [[beach]]; e.g. [[Hamamatsu]]
* ''hantō'' (半島) for a [[peninsula]]; e.g., [[Izu Peninsula|Izu Hanto]]
* ''ishi'' (石) or ''iwa'' (岩) for a rock; e.g., [[Ishikawa Prefecture]]; [[Iwate Prefecture]]
* ''izumi'' (泉) for a [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]]; e.g., [[Hiraizumi, Iwate]]
* ''kaikyō'' (海峡) for a [[strait]]; e.g., [[Bungo Province|Bungo]] kaikyō
* ''kawa'' or ''-gawa'' (川 or 河) for a [[river]]; e.g., [[Asakawa, Fukushima|Asakawa]]
* ''ko'' (湖) for a [[lake]]; e.g., [[Lake Biwa|Biwa-ko]], [[Lake Kizaki|Kizaki-ko]]
* ''nada'' (灘) for a [[sea]]
* ''oka'' (岡) for a [[hill]]; e.g., [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]]
* ''saki'' (崎) or ''misaki'' (岬) for a [[promontory]]; e.g., [[Miyazaki, Miyazaki|Miyazaki city]]
* ''san'' or ''-zan'' (山) or ''yama'' for a [[mountain]]; e.g., [[Yamanashi Prefecture]], [[Mount Aso|Aso-san]]
* ''sawa'' or ''-zawa'' (沢) for a [[swamp]]; e.g., [[Mizusawa, Iwate]]
* ''shima'' or ''-jima'' (島) or ''tō'' for an [[island]]; e.g., [[Ie-shima]], [[Iwo Jima]], [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa Honto]]
* ''tani'' or ''-dani'' (谷) for a [[valley]]
* ''wan'' (湾) for a [[Headlands and bays|headland or bay]]; e.g., [[Sagami Bay|Sagami-wan]]

==Natural world==
Other words that express the natural world or agriculture often appear in place names:
* ''ki'' or ''-gi'' (木) for a [[tree]]; e.g., [[Tochigi Prefecture]]
* ''matsu'' (松) for a [[pine]] tree; e.g. [[Takamatsu, Kagawa|Takamatsu]]
* ''mori'' (森) for a [[forest]]; e.g., [[Aomori Prefecture]]
* ''sugi'' (杉) for a [[sugi]] tree; e.g., [[Suginami, Tokyo|Suginami]]
* ''ta'' or ''-da'' (田) for a [[rice paddy]]; e.g. [[Ōda, Shimane|Ōda]]

==Former provinces==
Names and parts of names of former [[Provinces of Japan|provinces]] appear in many modern place names:
* [[Yamato Province|Yamato]]: Yamato-Koriyama, a city in [[Nara Prefecture]]
* [[Hitachi Province|Hitachi]]: [[Hitachinaka, Ibaraki|naka]], a city in [[Ibaraki Prefecture]]
* [[Sagami River]] in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]
* [[Tango Province|Tango]]: [[Tango Peninsula]] in [[Kyoto Prefecture|Kyoto]]
* Chūetsu, part of [[Niigata Prefecture]] and location of the [[2004 Chūetsu earthquake]]: its name incorporates a kanji from [[Echigo Province]] (as do many other place names in the region)

==Medieval Japan==
Medieval Japan had many towns that fell into three categories: castle towns, post towns, harbor towns. In addition, the rise of commerce contributed to some place names. Here are some parts of names connected with medieval Japan:
* ''ichi'' (市), a market; e.g., [[Yokkaichi, Mie|Yokkaichi]]: "fourth-day market"
* ''-jō'' (城), a castle. Place names giving directions relative to a castle, such as Jōhoku (North of the Castle), Jōsai (West of the Castle) or Jōnan (South of the Castle), are common throughout Japan.
* ''minato'' (港) for a [[harbor]]; e.g., [[Minato, Tokyo|Minato]]
* ''shuku'' or ''-juku'' (宿), a post or station town on a traditional highway; e.g., [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]]

==Hokkaido==
Many names in [[Hokkaido]] originated from words in the [[Ainu language]], as people from [[mainland Japan]] conquered and colonized Hokkaido in the [[Edo period]] and the [[Meiji period]]. Examples of geographic features are ''-nai'' and ''-betsu'' meaning "river", as in the names [[Wakkanai, Hokkaido|Wakkanai]] and [[Noboribetsu, Hokkaido|Noboribetsu]]. The name [[Esashi, Hokkaidō (Sōya)|Esashi]] comes from the Ainu word ''esaushi'', meaning "cape." Some other names come from places in other parts of Japan because in the past people migrated as a group to Hokkaido, and they give the new settlement a name reminiscent of their old home. Examples include [[Hiroshima, Hokkaido|Hiroshima]] and [[Date, Hokkaido]].

During the rule of the Shōguns (1185-1867), families of samurai often adopted place names as their surnames. Examples are the [[Ashikaga clan]] and the [[Taira clan]].

==Okinawa==
Place names in [[Okinawa Prefecture]] are drawn from the traditional [[Ryukyuan languages]]. Many place names use the unique languages names, while other place names have both a method of reading the name in Japanese and a way to read the name in one of the traditional local languages. The capital city [[Naha]] is ''Naafa'' in the [[Okinawan language]]. [[Uruma]], which was incorporated in 2005, comes from an old name for the Okinawa Island meaning "coral island" and its name is written in [[hiragana]] rather than kanji. In Okinawan, ''nishi'' meant "north" rather than "west" as it does in standard Japanese, so [[Nishihara, Okinawa|Nishihara]] means "northern field" in respect to its position from the old [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]] capital at [[Shuri, Okinawa|Shuri]]; in contrast, the Okinawan word for "west" is ''iri'', which appears in the name of [[Iriomote-jima]]. ''[[Gusuku]]'' (城) meaning "castle" is also common in place names in Okinawa, found in [[Tomigusuku]], [[Nakagusuku]], and [[Kitanakagusuku]], among others. Both [[Chatan, Okinawa|Chatan]] and [[Yomitan, Okinawa|Yomitan]] turn ''tani'' (谷, "valley") into ''tan''; Chatan also turns ''kita'' (北) into "cha" through the Okinawan language.

==Encyclopedias for Japanese place names==
The following encyclopedias and dictionaries are major research tools for reading and understanding Japanese place names and histories.

===Reading placenames===
''Shin Nihon chimei sakuin'' (新日本地名索引, 1993 New Index Gazetteer of Japan) Abokkusha.
This is the most comprehensive dictionary for reading place names. Each entry simply lists the reading of place name, its kanji, location, and longitude-latitude coordinate.

===Encyclopedias of Place Names===
''Dai Nihon Chimei Jisho'' (大日本地名辞書) is one of oldest, in 1907-1910, [[reprint]] and update version by 1971, published by ''Buzanbō'' ([[:ja:冨山房|富山房]]). The main editor was ''Tōgo Yoshida'' ([[:ja:吉田東伍|吉田 東伍]],1864-1918） written in [[vernacular]] expression in [[Meiji period]] with each entry includes the history and [[folklore]] for name.

''Kadokawa Nihon chimei daijiten'' (角川日本地名大辞典) [[Kadokawa Shoten]], published in the 1970s-1980s. This is the major encyclopedia for Japanese geographic reference. Each entry includes the history of the place, its population, major happenings in the place, and major buildings such as schools, temples, and churches among others.

''Konpakutoban Nihon chimei hyakka jiten'' (コンパクト版日本地名百科事典, Compact Land Japonica) [[Shogakukan]] in June 1998.
This is the desktop dictionary for geographic reference. It is designed to be easily comprehensible. It includes color maps of entire Japan and detail maps of major Japanese cities; Tokyo, Kyoto-shi, Nara-shi, Osaka-shi, and Nagoya-shi. The index for hard-to-read place names is included at the back of the dictionary.

===Place Names in History===
''Kodai chimei daijiten'' (古代地名大辞典) [[Kadokawa Shoten]]
This work lists in ''[[gojuon]]'' order the place names of ancient Japanese history. The periods range from the [[Asuka period]] (飛鳥時代, ''Asuka-jidai'', 538-710), [[Nara period]] (奈良時代, ''Nara-jidai'', 710-794), and [[Heian period]] (平安時代, ''Heian-jidai'', 710-1185). It especially focuses on the place names from the [[Man'yōshū]] (万葉集) poetry anthology and the [[Fudoki]] (風土記) chronicles.

===Origins of Place Names===
''Nihon chimei gogen jiten'' (日本地名語源事典) Shinjinbutsu oraisha
Based on the studies of geography and Japanese ancient words, each entry lists a few sentences about the origin and history of place names in ''gojuon'' order.

The '''Plain of Vic''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''Plana de Vic'') is a 30&amp;nbsp;km long [[Depression (geology)|depression]] located at the eastern end of the [[Catalan Central Depression]] in the [[Osona]] [[comarca]]. It is named after the town of [[Vic]], an important and ancient urban center in this [[natural region]] that lies in the midst of the plain. Other significant towns in the plain are [[Manlleu]] and [[Tona, Spain|Tona]].

This natural depression carved by [[river Ter]] and its tributaries is longer than it is wide and stretches in a N / S direction. It is completely surrounded by mountains: The [[Sub-Pyrenees]], with [[Bellmunt (Sant Pere de Torelló)|Bellmunt]] mountain towering in the north, the [[Lluçanès]] and [[Moianès]] high plateaus in the West, the [[Montseny]] in the southeast and the [[Guilleries]], located at the apex of the [[Catalan Transversal Range]] and the [[Catalan Pre-Coastal Range|Pre-Coastal Range]], in the east.

==Characteristics==
The Plain of Vic was the bed of an ancient sea. It is mainly formed by [[sedimentary rock]]s, like carbonatic [[lutite]], from the [[eocene]]. The most remarkable characteristic of the landscape in the plain are low, isolated hills known as ''turons testimoni'', "testimonial hills".&lt;ref&gt;S. Reguant et al. ''Geologia de la Plana de Vic.'' Patronat d'estudis Ausonencs. 1986&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fossil]]s are quite abundant in areas of the Plain of Vic.

The plain is subject to a phenomenon of [[Inversion (meteorology)|thermal inversion]], especially marked in calm weather days during the fall and the winter, by which the surrounding mountain ranges are often warmer than the plain. This inversion in temperature also reflects in the vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;E. Fontseré, ''L'anomalia tèrmica a la Plana de Vic''. Servei Meteorològic de Catalunya. 1937&lt;/ref&gt; The original vegetation of the plain was oak ''([[Quercus pubescens]])'' forest, but little is left owing to continuous human intervention since ancient times. Some very ancient oaks have been preserved as a tourist attraction.

There is presently no '''postal code''' system in [[Namibia]], although one is under consideration, which would use five-digit numeric codes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upu.int/fileadmin/documentsFiles/activities/addressingUnit/namEn.pdf Namibia], [[Universal Postal Union]], May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Before independence in 1990, when the country was under South African administration, it formed part of that country's [[List of postal codes in South Africa|post code system]], but following independence, use of post codes was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1c63AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Postal+codes+in+Namibia&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22postal+codes%22 ''The comprehensive handbook of the postmarks of German South West Africa, South West Africa, Namibia''], Ralph F.

'''Regionalization''' is the tendency to form [[Decentralization|decentralized]] [[region]]s. 

Regionalization or land classification can be observed in various disciplines:

*In [[agriculture]], see [[Agricultural Land Classification]].
*In [[biogeography]], see [[Biogeography#Biogeographic units]].
*In [[ecology]], see [[Ecological land classification]].
*In [[geography]], it has two ways: the process of delineating the Earth, its small areas or other units into regions and a state of such a delineation.
*In [[globalization]] discourse, it represents a world that becomes less interconnected, with a stronger regional focus.
*In [[politics]], it is the process of dividing a political entity or country into smaller jurisdictions (administrative divisions or subnational units) and transferring power from the central government to the regions; the opposite of unitarisation. See ''[[Regionalism (politics)]]''.
*In [[sport]], it is when a team has multiple "home" venues in different cities. Examples of regionalized teams include a few teams in the defunct [[American Basketball Association]], or the [[Green Bay Packers]] when they played in both Green Bay and Milwaukee from 1933-1994.
* In [[linguistics]], it is when a [[prestige dialect|prestige language]] adopts features of a regional language, such as how, in medieval times, [[Church Latin]] developed [[Latin regional pronunciation|regional pronunciation]] differences in the countries it was used, including [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[Denmark]], [[Hungary]], and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] countries.

[[File:World map indicating tropics and subtropics.png|thumb|upright=1.3|The subtropics and tropics]]
[[File:Subtropical.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Areas of the world with subtropical climates according to Köppen climate classification]]

The '''subtropics''' are [[Geographical zone|geographic]] and [[Köppen climate classification|climate zones]] located roughly between the [[tropics]] at latitude 23.5° (the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn]]) and [[temperate zone]]s (normally referring to latitudes 35&amp;ndash;66.5°) north and south of the [[Equator]].

Subtropical climates are often characterized by warm to hot summers and cool to mild winters with infrequent frost. Most subtropical climates fall into two basic types: [[humid subtropical]], where rainfall is often concentrated in the warmest months (for example [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]] or [[Jacksonville, Florida]]), and [[dry summer climate]] or ([[Mediterranean Climate|Mediterranean]]), where seasonal rainfall is concentrated in the cooler months (for example [[Naples]], [[Italy]] or [[Los Angeles, California]]).

Subtropical climates can occur at high elevations within the [[tropics]], such as in the southern end of the [[Mexican Plateau]] and in [[Vietnam]] and [[Taiwan]]. Six climate classifications use the term to help define the various [[temperature]] and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] regimes for the planet [[Earth]].

A great portion of the world's deserts are located within the subtropics, due to the development of the [[subtropical ridge]].  Within [[savanna]] regimes in the subtropics, a [[wet season]] is seen annually during the summer, which is when most of the yearly rainfall falls.  Within [[Mediterranean climate]] regimes, the wet season occurs during the winter.  Areas bordering warm oceans are prone to locally heavy rainfall from [[tropical cyclone]]s, which can contribute a significant percentage of the annual rainfall.  Plants such as [[palm (plant)|palms]], [[citrus]], [[mango]], [[pistachio]], [[lychee]], and [[avocado]] are grown within the subtropics.

==Definition==
{{See also|List of locations with a subtropical climate}}

The tropics have been historically defined as lying between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn]], located at latitudes 23.45° north and south, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.eolss.net/Sample-Chapters/C01/E4-03-04-03.pdf|title=Principal Weather Systems in Subtropical and Tropical Zones|author=I. G. Sitnikov|volume=1|chapter=1|publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the American Meteorological Society, the poleward fringe of the subtropics is located at latitudes approximately [[35th parallel north|35° north]] and [[35th parallel south|south]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Subtropics|title=Subtropics|author=Glossary of Meteorology|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|date=25 April 2012|accessdate=24 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several methods have been used to define the subtropical climate. In the [[Trewartha climate classification]], a subtropical region should have at least eight months with a mean temperature greater than {{convert|10|°C|°F|1}} and at least one month with a mean temperature under {{convert|18|°C|°F|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;Belda et al. Climate classification revisited: from Köppen to Trewartha. In: Climate Research Vol. 59: 1-13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; German climatologists Carl Troll and Karlheinz Paffen defined Warm temperate zones as plain and hilly lands having an average temperature of the coldest month between {{convert|2|°C|°F|1}} and {{convert|13|°C|°F|1}} in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and between {{convert|6|°C|°F|1}} and {{convert|13|°C|°F|1}} in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], excluding [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] and [[continental climate]]s.  According to the Troll-Paffen climate classification, there generally exists one large subtropical zone named the warm-temperate subtropical zone,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.tiscali.it/linnets/Troll-Paffen.jpg Climatic map by Istituto Geografico De Agostini, according to Troll-Paffen climate classification] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004052732/http://web.tiscali.it/linnets/Troll-Paffen.jpg |date=4 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is subdivided into seven smaller areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klimadiagramme.de/Frame/troll.html Die Klimaklassifikation nach Troll / Paffen] – klimadiagramme.de&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the E. Neef climate classification, the subtropical zone is divided into two parts: ''Rainy winters of the west sides'' and ''Eastern subtropical climate''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klimadiagramme.de/Frame/neef.html Die Klimaklassifikation nach E.

[[File:Earth Global Circulation.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|Hadley cells located on the Earth's atmospheric circulation.]]

Heating of the earth near the equator leads to large amounts of upward motion and convection along the [[monsoon trough]] or [[intertropical convergence zone]].  The upper-level divergence over the near-equatorial trough leads to air rising and moving away from the equator aloft.  As the air moves towards the mid-latitudes, it cools and sinks, which leads to subsidence near the [[30th parallel (disambiguation)|30th parallel]] of both hemispheres.  This circulation is known as the [[Hadley cell]] and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Owen E. Thompson (1996).

The [[humid subtropical climate]] is often located on the western side of the subtropical high. Here, unstable tropical airmasses in summer bring convective overturning and frequent tropical downpours, and summer is normally the season of peak annual rainfall. In the winter (dry season) the monsoon retreats, and the drier [[trade winds]] bring more stable airmass and often dry weather, and frequent sunny skies. Areas that have this type of subtropical climate include Australia, Southeast Asia, parts of South America, and the deep south of the United States.&lt;ref name="SAVWOOD"&gt;{{cite web|author=Susan Woodward |url=http://www.radford.edu/~swoodwar/CLASSES/GEOG235/biomes/savanna/savanna.html |title=Tropical Savannas |date=2 February 2005 |accessdate=16 March 2008 |publisher=[[Radford University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225082154/http://www.radford.edu/~swoodwar/CLASSES/GEOG235/biomes/savanna/savanna.html |archivedate=25 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randy Lascody (2008).

[[File:Wetland Hong Kong.jpg|thumb|right|Wetland Park in [[Hong Kong]].]]
{{Main article|Humid subtropical climate}}
The humid subtropical climate is a subtropical climate type characterized by hot, humid summers with frequent tropical downpours of short duration and warm, and frequently dry winters. In summer, the subtropical high pressure cells bring a sultry flow of tropical air with high dew points, and daily thundershowers are typical, though brief. Normally, rainfall is concentrated in the warmest months of the year. At times, the average annual precipitation may be more evenly distributed throughout the year, or a spring maximum is present. With decreasing latitude most humid subtropical climates typically have drier winters and wetter summers.

Humid subtropical climates lie on the lower east side of continents, roughly between [[latitude]]s 25° and 35° degrees away from the equator. In the United States, the humid subtropical zone is normally considered the region from central [[Florida]] north to northeastern [[North Carolina]].

On the immediate Atlantic coastline, the mediterranean boundary goes between [[Porto]] and [[Vigo]] at around 41° latitude. Parts of southwestern Australia around Perth have a Mediterranean climate as does areas around coastal South Africa.

==Religion and toponymy==
{{Serer religion}} 
{{main|Serer religion|Ndut initiation rite|Saltigue|Serer creation myth}}
Tattaguine [[Toponymy|derives its name]] from a [[bird]] called ''Tatta'' or ''Tat'' in the [[Serer language]].&lt;ref name="Tat"/&gt; According to [[Serer creation myth|Serer mythology]], prior to human habitation of this locality, it was these birds that lived there. The word ''Guine'' is the name of the bird's egg, i.e. the nesting of these birds.&lt;ref name="Tat"/&gt;
Several [[Serer religion|Serer religious festivals]] and [[:Category:Serer culture|customs]] are observed in Tattaguine. The [[Ndut initiation rite|Ndut rite of passage]] (the [[circumcision]] rite for boys) is just one of many rituals that are observed. It is in this rite that [[Ndut initiation rite#Education|they receive their education about the cosmos and the paranormal world]].  The classical Ndut teachings prepare boys to be brave and honourable men. The ''Ndut'' (nest) is the hut where they receive their education. It is also the place they develop their arttistic skills : singing, dancing and composing songs which are religious in nature (see [[Njuup]]). The initiation usually takes place at night around a camp fire, where they are taught about the mysteries of the [[Universe]], Serer medicine, etc.&lt;ref name="Tat"/&gt;

Serer religion and culture forbids the circumcision of girls ([[Female genital mutilation|FGM]]). [[Ndut initiation rite|Serer girls receive their initiation by tattooing of the gum]]. There is also the ''Bok'' ceremony for young married women. This is a fertility rite.&lt;ref name="Tat"/&gt;

The ''Misse'' is a religious dance. It takes place once year in April which coincides with the [[Serer religion#Raan Festival|Raan festival]]. It is a dance that implores the [[:Category:Serer deities|Serer deities]] for rain in order to have good harvest.&lt;ref name="Tat"/&gt; It is sometimes referred to as the rain dance [[:Category:Scholars of Serer religion|by some scholars]]. Somewhat similar to Misse is the ''Xoy'' or ''Khoye'' ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Variation : Khoy&lt;/ref&gt; The Xoy is not a dance but a religious ceremony where the Serer priestly class (the [[Saltigue]]s) gather once a year to [[divination|divine]] the future and the rainy season.&lt;ref name="Tat"/&gt;

==History==
{{main|Timeline of Serer history|Serer ancient history|Serer history (medieval era to present)}}
Tattaguine is one of the old Serer countries though much younger than the historic and spiritual village of [[Yaboyabo]]. In [[Serer history (medieval era to present)|Serer medieval]] and [[:Category:Serer royalty|dynastic history]], Tattaguine, which was in the pre-colonial Serer [[Kingdom of Sine]] was partnered with Ngouye because of their geographical affinity hence Ngouye-Tattaguine. Ngouye-Tattaguine gained particular prominence in the latter part of the 14th century, during the reigne of [[Maad a Sinig]] Diessanou Faye (king of Sine). It was one of the royal villages at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Diouf, Niokhobaye, Chronique du royaume du Sine, suivie de notes sur les traditions orales et les sources écrites concernant le royaume du Sine par Charles Becker et Victor Martin , Bulletin de l'IFAN, tome 34, série B, n° 4, (1972)", p 753 (p 35)&lt;/ref&gt; Diessanou Faye was the cousin and brother in law of [[Jaraff Boureh Gnilane Joof]] founder of [[the Royal House of Boureh Gnilane Joof]], the first royal house founded by the [[Joof family]]. 
During [[History of Senegal|France's colonization of Senegal]], old Tattaguine was divided due to population growth. This demarcation led to the creation of new localities : i.e. Tattaguine-Sérère (or ''Tattaguine-Serer'') and Tattaguine-Mbabara (Tattaguine-Bambara). The division of the old Tattaguine created Tattaguine-Sérère founded in 1901.&lt;ref name="Tat"/&gt; Its first chief as of 1901 was Ngor Tine. The first chief of Tattaguine-Mbabara was Thierkoro Diakhate (also the same year).&lt;ref name="Tat"/&gt; Since the division, position for the chief has become hereditary.&lt;ref name="Tat"/&gt;

==Administration==
Tattaguine is the chief town of the [[Tattguine District]] in the [[Fatick Department]], which lies within the [[Fatick Region]] of Senegal.

==Geography==
The closest localities are [[Yaboyabo]] (a holy place), [[Mbefel]], [[Gaskor]], [[Mboudaye Sek]], [[Ndiefer]] and [[Gaolamboura Diarab]].&lt;ref name="Fal"&gt;Fallingrain&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
Tattaguine's population consists mostly of the [[Serer people]], the original inhabitants of this area.&lt;ref name="Con p 5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Communaute Rurale de Tattaguine&lt;/ref&gt; They make up 99% of the total population.&lt;ref name="Con p 5"/&gt; Other groups include the [[Bambara people]].&lt;ref name="Tat"/&gt;

According to the site of PEPAM (Programme d'eau potable et d'assainissement du Millénaire ( 2012), the rural community of Tattaguine consists of 22,561 people and 2,552 houses.&lt;ref&gt;PEPAM&lt;/ref&gt; That is equivalent to 2423 people for 274 homes.&lt;ref&gt;"Localité de Tattaguine Serere" [in] PEPAM&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2003, the estimated population was 20394.&lt;ref name="Con p 5"/&gt;

==Economic activities==

This [[:Category:Serer country|Serer country]] used to be green and fertile, however, the peanut-[[monoculture]] has led to a decline in [[agriculture|agricultural]] production and income.  The main activity is seasonal subsistence farming. Crops growned include : [[millet]], [[peanut|groundnut]], [[cowpea]] (beans), [[watermelon]], [[Chili pepper|peppers]], [[sorrel]], [[bissap]] and [[tomato]].&lt;ref name="Tat"&gt;{{fr icon}} Electriciens sans frontieres Ile de France Comite Paris.  « De l’énergie pour les cases de santé du département de M’Bour Sénégal » Mission identification conception n°2007050 (2007), pp 5-7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tell Mar Elias''' is a [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]], i. e., a mound of several archaeological strata, located only a little beyond the northwest limits of [[Ajloun]] in the [[Ajloun Governorate]] in northern [[Jordan]] and in the historical region [[Gilead]] referenced in [[Sacred Scripture]]. The ruins of the historical town of Listib ("el-Ishtib" or "el-Istib" in [[Arabic]]) or [[Tishbe]], which ''[[1 Kings]]'', 17: 1 identifies as the residence and possibly even birthplace of the [[Elijah|Prophet Elijah]] ("Elias" in [[Latin]] and [[Arabic]]), are very proximate to the tell, being across a valley from it.&lt;ref&gt;Biblical Training, "Tishbite", [https://www.biblicaltraining.org/library/tishbite]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its proximity to the assumed locus of historical and religiously significant [[Tishbe]], 2 [[Christian]] churches were erected on the tell in the late [[Byzantium|Byzantine period]]:&lt;ref&gt;Jordan Tourism Board, "Religion &amp; Faith", "Tall Mar Elias", [http://na.visitjordan.com/Whattodo/ReligionFaith.aspx], accessed 28 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the site includes the ruins of one of the largest known [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] churches in [[Jordan]]. Artifacts from the site, including marble carvings and small metal religious objects, are displayed in the archaeological museum of nearby [[Ajloun Castle]]. Further, "respect for the spirit of ''Nebhī-Ilyâs'' (the [[Elijah|prophet Elias]]) is given to a grove of oak trees above the ruins" of the [[Byzantine]] churches there.&lt;ref&gt;Biblical Training, "Tishbite", [https://www.biblicaltraining.org/library/tishbite]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Pollinator Pathway''' is a participatory art, design and ecology [[social sculpture]]&lt;ref name=Constant/&gt; initiative founded by the artist and designer Sarah Bergmann. Its objective is to connect existing isolated green spaces and create a more hospitable urban environment for [[pollinator]]s like bees with a system of [[ecological corridor]]s of flowering plants by using existing urban infrastructure such as curb space and rooftops.

==Pathways==
[[File:Pollinator Pathway Columbia Street.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The Columbia Street pollinator pathway segment near downtown Seattle, Washington runs east-west from [[Nora's Woods]] to [[Seattle University]]. A planned extension connects north to [[Volunteer Park (Seattle)|Volunteer Park]].]]
[[File:The Pollinator Pathway project-getting ready for next phase (8210156875).jpg|thumb|Pollinator pathway native flower plot]]
The first pollinator pathway ({{coord|47|36|33.60|N|122|18|26.40|W|display=inline|type:landmark}}) is located on [[Seattle, Washington]]'s east-west Columbia Street, and connects [[Seattle University]]'s campus on 12th Avenue to [[Nora's Woods]] on 29th Avenue {{convert|1|mi|spell=in}} away, crossing one third of Seattle's width.&lt;ref name=seattlemag/&gt;&lt;ref name=good/&gt; A second {{convert|1.5|mile|adj=on}} long official pollinator pathway is slated for Seattle's north-south 11th Avenue, connecting Seattle University's campus to [[Volunteer Park (Seattle)|Volunteer Park]].&lt;ref name=capitolhilltimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=arcade/&gt;

The first segment of the pathway on Columbia Street, which Bergmann received grants from the City of Seattle, Northwest Horticultural Society, and [[Awesome Foundation]] to create,&lt;ref name=nhs/&gt;&lt;ref name=awesome/&gt; replaced a {{convert|108|ft|adj=on}} long, {{convert|12|ft|adj=on}} grass strip between the street and sidewalk with plants that could attract pollinators.&lt;ref name=seattletimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=seattlepi/&gt; The pathways are composed of individual plots of [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[native plant]] species on city-owned property, tended by local volunteers.&lt;ref name=seattlepi/&gt;&lt;ref name=easton/&gt;{{refn|name=name|group=notes|"[T]he artist works with each homeowner along the Pathway, as well as with designers, entomologists, botanists, landscape designers, urban planners, students and a host of volunteers". (Seattle Art Museum [SAM])&lt;ref name=sam/&gt;}}

Bergmann had a related installation, ''Portal to The Pollinator Pathway'', at [[Seattle Art Museum]]'s [[Olympic Sculpture Park]] in 2012.{{refn|group=notes|Described by SAM as "[a] garden containing native plants that attract pollinators such as bees, birds, and butterflies ... [that] provides a glimpse of a much more ambitious project".&lt;ref name=sam/&gt;}} In 2014, she made presentations on the project at [[Frye Art Museum]] and [[Seattle Tilth]].&lt;ref name=frye2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=seattletilth2014/&gt;

==Certification==
Since late 2013, Bergmann has offered a certification program for new pathways to use the trademarked Pollinator Pathway name.&lt;ref name=certification/&gt;

==Other cities==
Cities other than Seattle have explored the idea of connecting landscapes for pollinators. In 2008, about the same time the Seattle project was getting under way, the [[Canadian Pollination Initiative]] wrote a paper on a "pollinator park" concept to include "...right-of-way passages, including highways, power lines, gas lines and other maintained corridors can be designed in such a way that they serve as pollinator habitats."&lt;ref name=Horn/&gt;

In 2011, a New York author and artist Aaron Birk wrote an illustrated story, ''The Pollinator's Corridor'', about a pathway connecting the city's landscape.&lt;ref name=Birk/&gt;

===City–citizen discussions===
Several cities have used official means to initiate citizen discussions on their own pollinator pathways following Seattle's model, including [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]], Washington; the Niagara Falls, New York area; and Los Angeles, California via the mayor's blog.&lt;ref name=seattlecityblog/&gt;&lt;ref name=redmondcityblog/&gt;&lt;ref name=niagaragreenway/&gt;&lt;ref name=lamayorblog/&gt;

==Awards==
In 2012, Bergmann received ''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]'''s [[List of Stranger Genius Awards winners|Genius Award]] and [[Seattle Art Museum]]'s [[Betty Bowen Award]] for the project.&lt;ref name=strangergenius/&gt;&lt;ref name=cdnews/&gt; In 2013, she was named one of Seattle's most influential people of the year by ''Seattle Magazine'', along with recipients of the award who had created other Seattle area pollinator conservation projects.&lt;ref name=influential2013/&gt;

The '''Zanzibar Archipelago''' consists of several islands lying off the coast of [[East Africa]] south of the [[Somali sea]]. The archipelago is also known as the [[Spice_Islands_(disambiguation)|Spice Islands]]. There are four main islands, three primary islands with human populations, a fourth coral island that serves as an essential breeding ground for seabirds, plus a number of smaller islets that surround them and an isolated tiny islet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Africa Overland |author=Lizzie Williams|year= 2005|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=1-77007-187-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the archipelago belongs to the [[Zanzibar]] semi-autonomous region of [[Tanzania]], while [[Mafia Island]] and its associated islets are part of the [[Pwani Region]] on the mainland.
