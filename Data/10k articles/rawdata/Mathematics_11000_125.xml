==Etymology==
{{Main|Names for the number 0|Names for the number 0 in English}}
The word ''zero'' came into the English language via French ''zéro'' from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''zero'', Italian contraction of Venetian ''zevero'' form of 'Italian ''zefiro'' via ''ṣafira'' or ''ṣifr''.&lt;ref&gt;See:

The Italian mathematician [[Fibonacci]] (c. 1170–1250), who grew up in North Africa and is credited with introducing the decimal system to Europe, used the term ''zephyrum''. This became ''zefiro'' in Italian, and was then contracted to ''zero'' in Venetian. The Italian word ''[[Wikt:zefiro|zefiro]]'' was already in existence (meaning "west wind" from Latin and Greek ''[[Anemoi|zephyrus]]'') and may have influenced the spelling when transcribing Arabic ''ṣifr''.&lt;ref name="ifrah"&gt;{{cite book |first=Georges |last=Ifrah |title=The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer |location= |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-471-39340-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern usage===
There are different words used for the number or concept of zero depending on the context. For the simple notion of lacking, the words ''nothing'' and ''none'' are often used. Sometimes the words ''nought'', ''naught'' and ''aught''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/aught?s=t 'Aught' definition], Dictionary.com – Retrieved April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; are used. Several sports have specific words for zero, such as ''nil'' in [[association football]] (soccer), ''love'' in [[lawn tennis|tennis]] and ''a duck'' in [[cricket (sport)|cricket]]. It is often called ''oh'' in the context of telephone numbers. Slang words for zero include ''zip'', ''zilch'', ''nada'', and ''scratch.'' ''Duck egg'' and ''goose egg'' are also slang for zero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.com/browse/aught#visualthesaurus 'Aught' synonyms], Thesaurus.com – Retrieved April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==&lt;!--Linked from [[History of zero]] (R to section)--&gt;

Ancient [[Egyptian numerals]] were [[decimal|base 10]]. They used [[hieroglyphs]] for the digits and were not [[positional notation|positional]]. By 1770&amp;nbsp;BC, the Egyptians had a symbol for zero in accounting texts. The symbol nfr, meaning beautiful, was also used to indicate the base level in drawings of tombs and pyramids and distances were measured relative to the base line as being above or below this line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Joseph |first=George Gheverghese |page=86 |title=The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics (Third Edition) |isbn=978-0-691-13526-7 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press|Princeton]] |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, the [[Babylonian mathematics]] had a sophisticated [[sexagesimal]] positional numeral system. The lack of a positional value (or zero) was indicated by a ''space'' between sexagesimal numerals. By 300&amp;nbsp;BC, a punctuation symbol (two slanted wedges) was co-opted as a [[Free variables and bound variables|placeholder]] in the same [[Babylonian numerals|Babylonian system]]. In a tablet unearthed at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] (dating from about 700&amp;nbsp;BC), the scribe Bêl-bân-aplu wrote his zeros with three hooks, rather than two slanted wedges.&lt;ref name="multiref1"&gt;Kaplan, Robert. (2000). ''The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Babylonian placeholder was not a true zero because it was not used alone. Nor was it used at the end of a number. Thus numbers like 2 and 120 (2×60), 3 and 180 (3×60), 4 and 240 (4×60), looked the same because the larger numbers lacked a final sexagesimal placeholder. Only context could differentiate them.

===Pre-Columbian Americas===
[[File:Estela C de Tres Zapotes.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=illustration of a fractured inscribed stone with pre-Columbian glyphs and icons|The back of [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]] stela C from [[Tres Zapotes]], the second oldest [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Long Count]] date discovered. The numerals 7.16.6.16.18 translate to September, 32&amp;nbsp;BC (Julian). The glyphs surrounding the date are thought to be one of the few surviving examples of [[Isthmian script|Epi-Olmec script]].]]
The [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]] developed in south-central Mexico and Central America required the use of zero as a place-holder within its [[vigesimal]] (base-20) positional numeral system. Many different glyphs, including this partial [[quatrefoil]]—[[File:MAYA-g-num-0-inc-v1.svg|alt=small illustration of a partial quatrefoil in right half, whitespace in left half]]—were used as a zero symbol for these Long Count dates, the earliest of which (on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, [[Chiapas]]) has a date of 36&amp;nbsp;BC.{{efn|No long count date actually using the number 0 has been found before the 3rd century AD, but since the long count system would make no sense without some placeholder, and since Mesoamerican glyphs do not typically leave empty spaces, these earlier dates are taken as indirect evidence that the concept of 0 already existed at the time.}}

Since the eight earliest Long Count dates appear outside the Maya homeland,&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; it is generally believed that the use of zero in the Americas predated the Maya and was possibly the invention of the [[Olmec]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mortaigne |first=Véronique |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/nov/28/mayan-civilisation-paris-exhibition |title=The golden age of Mayan civilisation – exhibition review |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=November 28, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128222215/http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/nov/28/mayan-civilisation-paris-exhibition |archivedate=28 November 2014 |accessdate=October 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the earliest Long Count dates were found within the Olmec heartland, although the Olmec civilization ended by the {{nowrap|4th century BC}}, several centuries before the earliest known Long Count dates.

Although zero became an integral part of [[Maya numerals]], with a different, empty [[tortoise]]-like "[[Plastron|shell shape]]" used for many depictions of the "zero" numeral, it is assumed to have not influenced [[Old World]] numeral systems.

[[Quipu]], a knotted cord device, used in the [[Inca Empire]] and its predecessor societies in the [[Andes|Andean]] region to record accounting and other digital data, is encoded in a [[decimal|base ten]] positional system. Zero is represented by the absence of a knot in the appropriate position.

===Classical antiquity===
The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] had no symbol for zero (μηδέν), and did not use a digit placeholder for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/about/zero.jsp |title=The History of Zero |last=Wallin |first=Nils-Bertil |date=19 November 2002 |website=YaleGlobal online |publisher=The Whitney and Betty Macmillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale. |access-date=September 1, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825124525/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/about/zero.jsp |archivedate=25 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They seemed unsure about the status of zero as a number. They asked themselves, "How can nothing ''be'' something?", leading to philosophical and, by the [[medieval]] period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of zero and the [[vacuum]]. The [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]] of [[Zeno of Elea]] depend in large part on the uncertain interpretation of zero.

[[File:P. Lund, Inv. 35a.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=Fragment of papyrus with clear Greek script, lower-right corner suggests a tiny zero with a double-headed arrow shape above it|Example of the early Greek symbol for zero (lower right corner) from a 2nd-century papyrus]]
By 130&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Ptolemy]], influenced by [[Hipparchus]] and the Babylonians, was using a symbol for zero (a small circle with a long overbar) in his work on [[mathematical astronomy]] called the ''Syntaxis Mathematica'', also known as the ''[[Almagest]]''. The way in which it is used can be seen in his [[Ptolemy's table of chords|table of chords]] in that book. Ptolemy's zero was used within a [[sexagesimal]] numeral system otherwise using alphabetic [[Greek numerals]]. Because it was used alone, not just as a placeholder, this [[Greek numerals#Hellenistic zero|Hellenistic zero]] was perhaps the earliest documented use of a numeral representing zero in the Old World.&lt;ref&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Zero|title=A history of Zero}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the positions were usually limited to the fractional part of a number (called minutes, seconds, thirds, fourths, etc.)—they were not used for the integral part of a number, indicating a concept perhaps better expressed as "none", rather than "zero" in the modern sense. In later [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] manuscripts of Ptolemy's ''Almagest'', the Hellenistic zero had morphed into the Greek letter [[omicron]] (otherwise meaning 70).

Another zero was used in tables alongside [[Roman numerals#Zero|Roman numerals]] by 525 (first known use by [[Dionysius Exiguus]]), but as a word, ''nulla'' meaning "nothing", not as a symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zero and Fractions |url=http://www.knowtheromans.co.uk/Categories/SubCatagories/RomanNumerals/#V |website=Know the Romans |accessdate=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When division produced zero as a remainder, ''nihil'', also meaning "nothing", was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval [[computus|calculators of Easter]]. The initial "N" was used as a zero symbol in a table of Roman numerals by [[Bede]] or his colleagues around&amp;nbsp;725.

The ''[[Sunzi Suanjing|Sūnzĭ Suànjīng]]'', of unknown date but estimated to be dated from the 1st to {{nowrap|5th centuries AD}}, and Japanese records dated from the 18th&amp;nbsp;century, describe how the {{nowrap|c. 4th century BC}} Chinese  [[counting rods]] system enables one to perform decimal calculations. According to ''A History of Mathematics'', the rods "gave the decimal representation of a number, with an empty space denoting zero."&lt;ref name="Hodgkin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hodgkin |first=Luke |title=A History of Mathematics : From Mesopotamia to Modernity: From Mesopotamia to Modernity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f6HlhlBuQUgC&amp;pg=PA85 |date=2 June 2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-152383-0 |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The counting rod system is considered a [[positional notation]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Crossley, Lun. 1999, p.12 "the ancient Chinese system is a place notation system"&lt;/ref&gt;

In AD [[690]], [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wǔ]] promulgated [[Chinese characters of Empress Wu|Zetian characters]], one of which was "〇". The symbol 0 for denoting zero is a variation of this character.

Zero was not treated as a number at that time, but as a "vacant position".&lt;ref name="Crossley"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kang-Shen Shen |author2=John N. Crossley |author3=Anthony W. C.

Quote – "In the Chandah-sutra of Pingala, dating perhaps the third or second century BC, [ ...] Pingala's use of a zero symbol [śūnya] as a marker seems to be the first known explicit reference to zero." Kim Plofker (2009), Mathematics in India, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691120676}}, 55–56. "In the Chandah-sutra of Pingala, dating perhaps the third or second century BC, there are five questions concerning the possible meters for any value "n". [ ...] The answer is (2)&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = 128, as expected, but instead of seven doublings, the process (explained by the sutra) required only three doublings and two squarings – a handy time saver where "n" is large. Pingala’s use of a zero symbol as a marker seems to be the first known explicit reference to zero.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was considered that the earliest text to use a decimal [[positional notation|place-value system]], including a zero, is the ''[[Lokavibhaga|Lokavibhāga]]'', a [[Jain]] text on [[cosmology]] surviving in a medieval Sanskrit translation of the [[Prakrit]] original, which is internally dated to AD&amp;nbsp;458 ([[Saka era]] 380).

====Transmission to Islamic culture====
{{See also|History of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system}}
The [[Arabic]]-language inheritance of science was largely [[Greece|Greek]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Astronomy |first=A. |last=Pannekoek |page=165 |year=1961 |publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Hindu influences.&lt;ref name="Durant"&gt;Will Durant (1950), ''The Story of Civilization'', Volume 4, The Age of Faith: Constantine to Dante – A.D. 325–1300, Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|978-0965000758}}, p. 241, '''Quote''' = "The Arabic inheritance of science was overwhelmingly Greek, but Hindu influences ranked next. In 773, at Mansur's behest, translations were made of the ''Siddhantas'' – Indian astronomical treatises dating as far back as 425 BC; these versions may have the vehicle through which the "Arabic" numerals and the '''zero''' were brought from India into Islam. In 813, al-Khwarizmi used the Hindu numerals in his astronomical tables."&lt;/ref&gt; In 773, at [[Al-Mansur]]'s behest, translations were made of many ancient treatises including Greek, Roman, Indian, and others.

In AD 813, astronomical tables were prepared by a [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician, [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]], using Hindu numerals;&lt;ref name="Durant"/&gt; and about 825, he published a book synthesizing Greek and Hindu knowledge and also contained his own contribution to mathematics including an explanation of the use of zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brezina |first=Corona |title=Al-Khwarizmi: The Inventor Of Algebra |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=955jPgAACAAJ |year=2006 |publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-4042-0513-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book was later translated into [[Latin]] in the 12th&amp;nbsp;century under the title ''Algoritmi de numero Indorum''. This title means "al-Khwarizmi on the Numerals of the Indians". The word "Algoritmi" was the translator's Latinization of Al-Khwarizmi's name, and the word "Algorithm" or "Algorism" started meaning any arithmetic based on decimals.&lt;ref name="Durant"/&gt;

[[Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Khwarizmi]], in 976, stated that if no number appears in the place of tens in a calculation, a little circle should be used "to keep the rows". This circle was called ''ṣifr''.&lt;ref&gt;Will Durant (1950), ''The Story of Civilization'', Volume 4, '''The Age of Faith''', Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|978-0965000758}}, p. 241, '''Quote''' = "In 976, Muhammad ibn Ahmad, in his ''Keys of the Sciences'', remarked that if, in a calculation, no number appears in the place of tens, a little circle should be used "to keep the rows". This circle the Mosloems called ''ṣifr'', "empty" whence our cipher."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transmission to Europe====
The [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] (base 10) reached Europe in the 11th century, via the [[Iberian Peninsula]] through Spanish [[Muslim]]s, the [[Moors]], together with knowledge of [[astronomy]] and instruments like the [[astrolabe]], first imported by [[Pope Sylvester II|Gerbert of Aurillac]]. For this reason, the numerals came to be known in Europe as "Arabic numerals". The Italian mathematician [[Fibonacci]] or Leonardo of Pisa was instrumental in bringing the system into European mathematics in 1202, stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
After my father's appointment by his homeland as state official in the customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed in the study of calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the [[Hinduism|Hindus]] (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0&amp;nbsp; ... any number may be written.&lt;ref&gt;Sigler, L.,  ''Fibonacci's Liber Abaci''. English translation, Springer, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grimm, R.E., "The Autobiography of Leonardo Pisano", ''[[Fibonacci Quarterly]]'' '''11'''/1 (February 1973), pp. 99–104.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here Leonardo of Pisa uses the phrase "sign 0", indicating it is like a sign to do operations like addition or multiplication. From the 13th&amp;nbsp;century, manuals on calculation (adding, multiplying, extracting roots, etc.) became common in Europe where they were called ''[[algorism]]us'' after the Persian mathematician al-Khwārizmī. The most popular was written by [[Johannes de Sacrobosco]], about 1235 and was one of the earliest scientific books to be ''printed'' in 1488. Until the late 15th&amp;nbsp;century, Hindu–Arabic numerals seem to have predominated among mathematicians, while merchants preferred to use the [[Roman numerals]]. In the 16th&amp;nbsp;century, they became commonly used in Europe.

&lt;/ref&gt; 0 is a [[natural number]], and then the only natural number not to be positive. Zero is a number which quantifies a count or an amount of [[Empty set|null]] size. In most [[History of mathematics|cultures]], 0 was identified before the idea of negative things, or quantities less than zero, was accepted.

The value, or ''number'', zero is not the same as the ''digit'' zero, used in [[numeral system]]s using [[positional notation]]. Successive positions of digits have higher weights, so inside a numeral the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate weights to the preceding and following digits. A zero digit is not always necessary in a positional number system, for example, in the number 02. In some instances, a [[leading zero]] may be used to distinguish a number.

===Elementary algebra===
The number 0 is the smallest [[non-negative]] integer. The [[natural number]] following 0 is 1 and no natural number precedes 0. The number 0 [[Natural number#History of natural numbers and the status of zero|may or may not be considered a natural number]], but it is an integer, and hence a [[rational number]] and a [[real number]] (as well as an [[algebraic number]] and a [[complex number]]).

The number 0 is neither positive nor negative and is usually displayed as the central number in a [[number line]]. It is neither a [[prime number]] nor a [[composite number]]. It cannot be prime because it has an [[infinity|infinite]] number of [[divisor|factors]], and cannot be composite because it cannot be expressed as a product of prime numbers (0 must always be one of the factors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reid |first1=Constance |title=From zero to infinity: what makes numbers interesting |year=1992 |edition=4th |publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d3NFIvrTk4sC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=zero+neither+prime+nor+composite&amp;q=zero%20neither%20prime%20nor%20composite |isbn=978-0-88385-505-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zero is, however, [[Parity (mathematics)|even]] (as well as being a multiple of any other integer, rational, or real number).

The following are some basic (elementary) rules for dealing with the number 0. These rules apply for any real or complex number ''x'', unless otherwise stated.
*Addition: ''x'' + 0 = 0 + ''x'' = ''x''. That is, 0 is an [[identity element]] (or neutral element) with respect to addition.
*Subtraction: ''x'' − 0 = ''x'' and 0 − ''x'' = −''x''.
*Multiplication: ''x'' · 0 = 0 · ''x'' = 0.
*Division: {{sfrac|0|''x''}} = 0, for nonzero ''x''. But {{sfrac|''x''|0}} is [[Defined and undefined|undefined]], because 0 has no [[multiplicative inverse]] (no real number multiplied by 0 produces 1), a consequence of the previous rule.
*Exponentiation: ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = {{sfrac|''x''|''x''}} = 1, except that the case ''x'' = 0 may be left undefined in some [[0 to the power of 0|contexts]]. For all positive real ''x'', {{nowrap|0&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 0}}.

The expression {{sfrac|0|0}}, which may be obtained in an attempt to determine the limit of an expression of the form {{sfrac|''f''(''x'')|''g''(''x'')}} as a result of applying the [[limit of a function|lim]] operator independently to both operands of the fraction, is a so-called "[[indeterminate form]]". That does not simply mean that the limit sought is necessarily undefined; rather, it means that the limit of {{sfrac|''f''(''x'')|''g''(''x'')}}, if it exists, must be found by another method, such as [[l'Hôpital's rule]].

The sum of 0 numbers (the ''[[empty sum]]'') is 0, and the product of 0 numbers (the ''[[empty product]]'') is 1. The [[factorial]] 0! evaluates to 1, as a special case of the empty product.

===Other branches of mathematics===
*In [[set theory]], 0 is the [[cardinality]] of the empty set: if one does not have any apples, then one has 0 apples. In fact, in certain axiomatic developments of mathematics from set theory, 0 is ''[[definition|defined]]'' to be the empty set. When this is done, the empty set is the [[Von Neumann cardinal assignment]] for a set with no elements, which is the empty set. The cardinality function, applied to the empty set, returns the empty set as a value, thereby assigning it 0 elements.
*Also in set theory, 0 is the lowest [[ordinal number]], corresponding to the empty set viewed as a [[well-order|well-ordered set]].
*In [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]], 0 may be used to denote the [[truth value]] false.
*In [[abstract algebra]], 0 is commonly used to denote a [[zero element]], which is a [[Identity element|neutral element]] for addition (if defined on the structure under consideration) and an [[absorbing element]] for multiplication (if defined).
*In [[lattice (order)|lattice theory]], 0 may denote the [[Greatest element|bottom element]] of a [[Lattice (order)|bounded lattice]].
*In [[category theory]], 0 is sometimes used to denote an [[initial and terminal objects|initial object]] of a [[category (mathematics)|category]].
*In [[recursion theory]], 0 can be used to denote the [[Turing degree]] of the [[computable function|partial computable functions]].

===Related mathematical terms===
*A [[root of a function|zero of a function]] ''f'' is a point ''x'' in the domain of the function such that {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 0}}. When there are finitely many zeros these are called the roots of the function. This is related to [[zero (complex analysis)|zeros]] of a [[holomorphic function]].
*The '''zero function''' (or zero map) on a domain ''D'' is the [[constant function]] with 0 as its only possible output value, i.e., the function ''f'' defined by {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') {{=}} 0}} for all ''x'' in ''D''. The zero function is the only function that is both [[Even function|even]] and [[Odd function|odd]]. A particular zero function is a [[zero morphism]] in category theory; e.g., a zero map is the identity in the additive group of functions. The [[determinant]] on non-invertible [[Matrix (mathematics)|square matrices]] is a zero map.
*Several branches of mathematics have [[zero element]]s, which generalize either the property {{nowrap|0 + ''x'' {{=}} ''x''}}, or the property {{nowrap|0 · ''x'' {{=}} 0,}} or both.

==Physics==
The value zero plays a special role for many physical quantities. For some quantities, the zero level is naturally distinguished from all other levels, whereas for others it is more or less arbitrarily chosen. For example, for an [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]] (as measured in [[kelvin]]s) [[absolute zero|zero]] is the lowest possible value ([[negative temperature]]s are defined, but negative-temperature systems are not actually colder). This is in contrast to for example temperatures on the Celsius scale, where zero is arbitrarily defined to be at the [[Melting point|freezing point]] of water. Measuring sound intensity in [[decibel]]s or [[phon]]s, the zero level is arbitrarily set at a reference value—for example, at a value for the threshold of hearing. In [[physics]], the [[zero-point energy]] is the lowest possible energy that a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[physical system]] may possess and is the energy of the [[Stationary state|ground state]] of the system.

==Chemistry==
Zero has been proposed as the [[atomic number]] of the theoretical element [[tetraneutron]]. It has been shown that a cluster of four [[neutron]]s may be stable enough to be considered an [[atom]] in its own right. This would create an [[chemical element|element]] with no [[proton]]s and no charge on its [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]].

As early as 1926, Andreas von Antropoff coined the term [[neutronium]] for a conjectured form of [[matter]] made up of neutrons with no protons, which he placed as the chemical element of atomic number zero at the head of his new version of the [[periodic table]]. It was subsequently placed as a noble gas in the middle of several spiral representations of the periodic system for classifying the chemical elements.

==Computer science==
The most common practice throughout human history has been to start counting at one, and this is the practice in early classic [[computer science]] programming languages such as [[Fortran]] and [[COBOL]]. However, in the late 1950s [[LISP]] introduced [[zero-based numbering]] for arrays while [[Algol 58]] introduced completely flexible basing for array subscripts (allowing any positive, negative, or zero integer as base for array subscripts), and most subsequent programming languages adopted one or other of these positions. For example, the elements of an [[Array data type|array]] are numbered starting from 0 in [[C (computer language)|C]], so that for an array of ''n'' items the sequence of array indices runs from 0 to {{nowrap|''n''−1}}. This permits an array element's location to be calculated by adding the index directly to address of the array, whereas 1-based languages precalculate the array's base address to be the position one element before the first.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

There can be confusion between 0- and 1-based indexing, for example Java's [[JDBC]] indexes parameters from 1 although [[Java (programming language)|Java]] itself uses 0-based indexing.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In databases, it is possible for a field not to have a value. It is then said to have a [[null (SQL)|null value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SdLsCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT197&amp;dq=%C2%A0In+databases,+it+is+possible+for+a+field+not+to+have+a+value+(null)#v=onepage&amp;q=%C2%A0In%20databases,%20it%20is%20possible%20for%20a%20field%20not%20to%20have%20a%20value%20(null)&amp;f=false |title=Knowledge-Base Assisted Database Retrieval Systems |last=Wu |first=X. |last2=Ichikawa |first2=T. |last3=Cercone |first3=N. |date=1996-10-25 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=9789814501750 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For numeric fields it is not the value zero. For text fields this is not blank nor the empty string. The presence of null values leads to [[Ternary logic|three-valued logic]]. No longer is a condition either ''true'' or ''false'', but it can be ''undetermined''. Any computation including a null value delivers a null result.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

A [[null pointer]] is a pointer in a computer program that does not point to any object or function. In C, the integer constant 0 is converted into the null pointer at [[compile time]] when it appears in a pointer context, and so 0 is a standard way to refer to the null pointer in code. However, the internal representation of the null pointer may be any bit pattern (possibly different values for different data types).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In mathematics {{nowrap|−0 {{=}} +0 {{=}} 0;}} both −0 and +0 represent exactly the same number, i.e., there is no "positive zero" or "negative zero" distinct from zero. However, in some computer hardware [[signed number representations]], zero has two distinct representations, a positive one grouped with the positive numbers and a negative one grouped with the negatives; this kind of dual representation is known as [[signed zero]], with the latter form sometimes called negative zero. These representations include the [[signed magnitude]] and [[one's complement]] binary integer representations (but not the [[two's complement]] binary form used in most modern computers), and most [[floating point]] number representations (such as [[IEEE floating point|IEEE 754]] and [[IBM Floating Point Architecture|IBM S/390]] floating point formats).

In binary, 0 represents the value for "off", which means no electricity flow.{{sfn|Chris Woodford|2006|p=9}}

Many [[Application programming interface|API]]s and [[operating system]]s that require applications to return an integer value as an [[exit status]] typically use zero to indicate success and non-zero values to indicate specific [[error code|error]] or warning conditions.

==Other fields==
*In telephony, pressing 0 is often used for dialling out of a [[Business telephone system|company network]] or to a different [[Trunk prefix|city or region]], and 00 is used for dialling [[International call prefix|abroad]]. In some countries, dialling 0 places a call for [[operator assistance]].
*DVDs that can be played in any region are sometimes referred to as being "[[region 0]]"
*[[Roulette]] wheels usually feature a "0" space (and sometimes also a "00" space), whose presence is ignored when calculating payoffs (thereby allowing the house to win in the long run).
*In [[Formula One]], if the reigning [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Champion]] no longer competes in Formula One in the year following their victory in the title race, 0 is given to one of the drivers of the team that the reigning champion won the title with. This happened in 1993 and 1994, with [[Damon Hill]] driving car 0, due to the reigning World Champion ([[Nigel Mansell]] and [[Alain Prost]] respectively) not competing in the championship.
* On the U.S. [[Interstate Highway System]], in most states exits are numbered based on the nearest milepost from the highway's western or southern terminus within that state. Several that are less than half a mile (800 m) from state boundaries in that direction are numbered as Exit 0.

Traditionally, many print typefaces made the capital letter [[O]] more rounded than the narrower, elliptical digit 0.&lt;ref name="bemer"/&gt; [[Typewriter]]s originally made no distinction in shape between O and 0; some models did not even have a separate key for the digit 0. The distinction came into prominence on modern character [[Visual display unit|displays]].&lt;ref name="bemer"&gt;{{cite journal |first=R. W. |last=Bemer |title=Towards standards for handwritten zero and oh: much ado about nothing (and a letter), or a partial dossier on distinguishing between handwritten zero and oh |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=10 |issue=8 |year=1967 |pages=513–518 |doi=10.1145/363534.363563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[slashed zero]] can be used to distinguish the number from the letter. The digit 0 with a dot in the center seems to have originated as an option on [[IBM 3270]] displays and has continued with some modern computer typefaces such as [[Andalé Mono]], and in some airline reservation systems. One variation uses a short vertical bar instead of the dot. Some fonts designed for use with computers made one of the capital-O–digit-0 pair more rounded and the other more angular (closer to a rectangle). A further distinction is made in [[FE-Schrift|falsification-hindering typeface]] as used on [[Vehicle registration plates of Germany|German car number plates]] by slitting open the digit 0 on the upper right side. Sometimes the digit 0 is used either exclusively, or not at all, to avoid confusion altogether.

In the [[Before Christ|BC]] [[calendar era]], the year 1&amp;nbsp;BC is the first year before AD&amp;nbsp;1; there is not a [[year zero]]. By contrast, in [[astronomical year numbering]], the year 1&amp;nbsp;BC is numbered 0, the year 2&amp;nbsp;BC is numbered −1, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Marking time: the epic quest to invent the perfect calendar |first=Duncan |last=Steel |page=113 |year=2000 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-29827-4 |quote=In the B.C./A.D. scheme there is no year zero.

'''131''' ('''one hundred [and] thirty-one''') is the [[natural number]] following [[130 (number)|130]] and preceding [[132 (number)|132]].

==In mathematics==
'''131''' is a [[Sophie Germain prime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A005384|title=Sloane's A005384 : Sophie Germain primes|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[irregular prime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A000928|title=Sloane's A000928 : Irregular primes|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second 3-digit [[palindromic prime]], and also a [[permutable prime]] with [[113 (number)|113]] and 311. It can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive primes, 131 = 41 + 43 + 47. 131 is an [[Eisenstein prime]] with no imaginary part and real part of the form &lt;math&gt;3n - 1&lt;/math&gt;. Because the next odd number, 133, is a [[semiprime]], 131 is a [[Chen prime]]. 131 is an [[Ulam number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A002858|title=Ulam numbers|last=|first=|date=2016-04-18|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

131 is a [[full reptend prime]] in [[base (exponentiation)|base]] 10 (and also in [[base 2]]). The decimal expansion of 1/131 repeats the digits 007633587786259541984732824427480916030534351145038167938931 297709923664122137404580152671755725190839694656488549618320 6106870229 indefinitely.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2889">In [[mathematics]], '''Alcuin's sequence''', named after [[Alcuin of York]], is the sequence of coefficients of the power-series expansion of:&lt;ref name=oeis&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A005044 |name=Alcuin's sequence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{x^3}{(1-x^2)(1-x^3)(1-x^4)} = x^3 + x^5 + x^6 + 2x^7 + x^8 + 3x^9 + \cdots. &lt;/math&gt;

The sequence begins with these integers:

: 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5, 4, 7, 5, 8, 7, 10, 8, 12, 10, 14, 12, 16, 14, 19, 16, 21 {{OEIS|id=A005044 |name=Alcuin's sequence}}

The ''n''th term is the number of [[Heron triangle|triangles with integer sides]] and perimeter&amp;nbsp;''n''.&lt;ref name=oeis/&gt;  It is also the number of triangles with ''distinct'' integer sides and perimeter ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;6, i.e. number of triples (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c'') such that 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b'', ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;6.

If one deletes the three leading zeros, then it is the number of ways in which ''n'' empty casks, ''n'' casks half-full of wine and ''n'' full casks can be distributed to three persons in such a way that each one gets the same number of casks and the same amount of wine. This is the generalization of problem 12 appearing in [[Propositiones ad Acuendos Juvenes]] ("Problems to Sharpen the Young") usually attributed to Alcuin. That problem is given as,
:Problem 12: A certain father died and left as an inheritance to his three sons 30 glass flasks, of which 10 were full of oil, another 10 were half full, while another 10 were empty. Divide the oil and flasks so that an equal share of the commodities should equally come down to the three sons, both of oil and glass.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3620384 Problems to Sharpen the Young], John Hadley and David Singmaster, ''The Mathematical Gazette'', '''76''', #475 (March 1992), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Alcuin's sequence" may be traced back to D. Olivastro's 1993 book on mathematical games, ''Ancient Puzzle: Classical Brainteasers and Other Timeless Mathematical Games of the Last 10 Centuries'' (Bantam, New York).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Donald J.|last1=Binder|first2=Martin|last2=Erickson|title=Alcuin's Sequence|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=119|issue=2|year=2012|pages=115–121|doi=10.4169/amer.math.monthly.119.02.115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence with the three leading zeros deleted is obtained as the sequence of coefficients of the power-series expansion of&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A266755}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wolfram&gt;{{MathWorld|title = Alcuin's Sequence |id = AlcuinsSequence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anderson, Alexander – Supplementum Apollonii redivivi, 1612 – BEIC 17635.jpg|thumb|''Supplementum Apollonii redivivi'', 1612]]

'''Alexander Anderson''' ({{circa|1582}} in [[Aberdeen]] – {{circa|1620}} in [[Paris]]) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[mathematician]].

==Life==
He was born in [[Aberdeen]], possibly in 1582, according to a print which suggests he was aged 35 in 1617.&lt;ref name=ws&gt;[[Wikisource:Anderson, Alexander (1582-1619?) (DNB00)]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown where he was educated, but it is likely that he initially studied writing and philosophy (the "belles lettres") in his home city of Aberdeen.&lt;ref name=gbd&gt;{{cite book |title=The General Biographical Dictionary: Containing an Historical and Critical Account of the Lives and Writings of the Most Eminent Persons in Every Nation: Particularly the British and Irish; from the Earliest Accounts to the Present Time |last=Chalmers |first=A. |year=1812 |publisher=J. Nichols |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ZtjAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA175 |pages=175–176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He then went to the [[Mainland Europe|continent]], and was a professor of mathematics in Paris by the start of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=gbd/&gt; There he published or edited, between the years 1612 and 1619, various [[geometric]] and [[algebra]]ic tracts.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He described himself as having "more wisdom than riches" in the dedication of ''Vindiciae Archimedis'' (1616).&lt;ref name=ws/&gt;

He was first cousin of David Anderson of Finshaugh, a celebrated mathematician, and David Anderson's daughter was the mother of mathematician [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]].&lt;ref name=ee&gt;{{cite book |title=The Edinburgh encyclopædia conducted by David Brewster, with the assistance of gentlemen eminent in science and literature |last=Brewster |first=D. |year=1832 |publisher=J. and E. Parker |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FKxGAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA41 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
He was selected by the executors of [[François Viète]] to revise and edit Viète's manuscript works. Viète died in 1603, and it is unclear if Anderson knew him, but his eminence was sufficient to attract the attention of the dead man's executors.&lt;ref name=los&gt;{{cite book |title=Lives of illustrious and distinguished Scotsman, forming a complete Scottish biographic dictionary |last=Chambers  |first=R. |year=1841 |publisher=Blackie and Son |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMM5AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA37 |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson corrected and expanded upon Viète's manuscripts, which extended known geometry to the [[new algebra]], which used general symbols to represent quantities.&lt;ref name=los/&gt;

===Publications===
The known works of Anderson amount to six thin quarto volumes, and as the last of them was published in 1619, it is probable that the author died soon after that year, but the precise date is unknown.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He wrote other works that have since been lost.&lt;ref name=bdes/&gt; From his last work it appears he wrote another piece, "A Treatise on the Mensuration of Solids,"&lt;ref name=bdes&gt;{{cite book|title=A Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen, in Four Vols|author1=Chambers, R.|author2=Thomson, T.|date=1856|issue=v. 1|publisher=Blackie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=McQZAAAAYAAJ|page=53|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and copies of two other works, ''Ex. Math.'' and ''Stereometria Triangulorum Sphæricorum'', were in the possession of Sir Alexander Hume until the after the middle of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=ws/&gt;

==Review of Lovász local lemma==
{{main|Lovász local lemma}}

The Lovász Local Lemma is a powerful tool commonly used in the [[probabilistic method]] to prove the existence of certain complex mathematical objects with a set of prescribed features. A typical proof proceeds by operating on the complex object in a random manner and uses the Lovász Local Lemma to bound the probability that any of the features is missing. The absence of a feature is considered a ''bad event'' and if it can be shown that all such bad events can be avoided simultaneously with non-zero probability, the existence follows. The lemma itself reads as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} = \{ A_1, \ldots, A_n \}&lt;/math&gt; be a finite set of events in the probability space Ω. For &lt;math&gt; A \in \mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt; \Gamma(A)&lt;/math&gt; denote a subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is independent from the collection of events &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} \setminus (\{A \} \cup \Gamma(A))&lt;/math&gt;. If there exists an assignment of reals &lt;math&gt; x : \mathcal{A} \rightarrow (0,1) &lt;/math&gt; to the events such that

:&lt;math&gt; \forall A \in \mathcal{A} : \Pr[A] \leq x(A) \prod_{B \in \Gamma(A)} (1-x(B)) &lt;/math&gt;

then the probability of avoiding all events in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt; is positive, in particular

:&lt;math&gt; \Pr\left[\,\overline{A_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \overline{A_n}\,\right] \geq \prod_{A \in \mathcal{A}} (1-x(A)). &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Algorithmic version of the Lovász local lemma==
The Lovász Local Lemma is non-constructive because it only allows us to conclude the existence of structural properties or complex objects but does not indicate how these can be found or constructed efficiently in practice. Note that random sampling from the probability space Ω is likely to be inefficient, since the probability of the event of interest

:&lt;math&gt; \Pr \left[ \overline{A_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \overline{A_n} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

is only bounded by a product of small numbers

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{A \in \mathcal{A}} (1-x(A)) &lt;/math&gt;

and therefore likely to be very small.

Under the assumption that all of the events in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt; are determined by a finite collection of mutually independent [[Random Variable|random variables]] &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P} &lt;/math&gt; in Ω, [[Robin Moser]] and [[Gábor Tardos]] proposed an efficient randomized algorithm that computes an assignment to the random variables in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P} &lt;/math&gt; such that all events in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt; are avoided.

Hence, this algorithm can be used to efficiently construct witnesses of complex objects with prescribed features for most problems to which the Lovász Local Lemma applies.

===History===

Prior to the recent work of Moser and Tardos, earlier work had also made progress in developing algorithmic versions of the Lovász Local Lemma.  [[József Beck]] in 1991 first gave proof that an algorithmic version was possible.&lt;ref name=beck:rsa91&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1002/rsa.3240020402|first=József|last=Beck|authorlink=József Beck|title=An algorithmic approach to the Lovász Local Lemma. I|journal=Random Structures and Algorithms|volume=2|issue=4|pages=343–366|year=1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this breakthrough result, a stricter requirement was imposed upon the problem formulation than in the original non-constructive definition.  Beck's approach required that for each &lt;math&gt;A \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, the number of dependencies of ''A'' was bounded above with &lt;math&gt;|\Gamma(A)| &lt; 2^{\frac{n}{48}}&lt;/math&gt; (approximately).  The existential version of the Local Lemma permits a larger upper bound on dependencies:

:&lt;math&gt;|\Gamma(A)| &lt; \frac{2^{n}}{e},&lt;/math&gt;

This bound is known to be tight.  Since the initial algorithm, work has been done to push algorithmic versions of the Local Lemma closer to this tight value.  Moser and Tardos's recent work are the most recent in this chain, and provide an algorithm that achieves this tight bound.

===Algorithm===
Let us first introduce some concepts that are used in the algorithm.

For any random variable &lt;math&gt; P \in \mathcal{P}, v_P &lt;/math&gt; denotes the current assignment (evaluation) of ''P''. An assignment (evaluation) to all random variables is denoted &lt;math&gt; (v_P)_{\mathcal{P}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The unique minimal subset of random variables in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P} &lt;/math&gt; that determine the event ''A'' is denoted by vbl(''A'').

If the event ''A'' is true under an evaluation &lt;math&gt; (v_P)_{\mathcal{P}}&lt;/math&gt;, we say that &lt;math&gt; (v_P)_{\mathcal{P}}&lt;/math&gt; '''satisfies''' ''A'', otherwise it '''avoids''' ''A''.

Given a set of bad events &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt; we wish to avoid that is determined by a collection of mutually independent random variables &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P} &lt;/math&gt;, the algorithm proceeds as follows:

# &lt;math&gt; \forall P \in \mathcal{P} &lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt; v_P \leftarrow &lt;/math&gt; a random evaluation of P
# '''while''' &lt;math&gt; \exists A \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; such that A is satisfied by &lt;math&gt; (v_P)_{\mathcal{P}}&lt;/math&gt;
#* pick an arbitrary satisfied event &lt;math&gt; A \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;
#* &lt;math&gt; \forall P \in \text{vbl}(A) &lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt; v_P \leftarrow &lt;/math&gt; a new random evaluation of P
# '''return''' &lt;math&gt; (v_P)_{\mathcal{P}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the first step, the algorithm randomly initializes the current assignment ''v&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each random variable &lt;math&gt; P \in \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;. This means that an assignment ''v&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;'' is sampled randomly and independently according to the distribution of the random variable ''P''.

The algorithm then enters the main loop which is executed until all events in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt; are avoided and which point the algorithm returns the current assignment. At each iteration of the main loop, the algorithm picks an arbitrary satisfied event ''A'' (either randomly or deterministically) and resamples all the random variables that determine ''A''.

===Main theorem===
Let &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P} &lt;/math&gt; be a finite set of mutually independent random variables in the probability space Ω. Let &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt; be a finite set of events determined by these variables. If there exists an assignment of reals &lt;math&gt; x : \mathcal{A} \to (0,1) &lt;/math&gt; to the events such that

:&lt;math&gt; \forall A \in \mathcal{A} : \Pr[A] \leq x(A) \prod_{B \in \Gamma(A)} (1-x(B)) &lt;/math&gt;

then there exists an assignment of values to the variables &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; avoiding all of the events in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt;.

Moreover, the randomized algorithm described above resamples an event &lt;math&gt; A \in \mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt; at most an expected

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{x(A)}{1-x(A)}&lt;/math&gt;

times before it finds such an evaluation. Thus the expected total number of resampling steps and therefore the expected runtime of the algorithm is at most

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{A \in \mathcal{A}} \frac{x(A)}{1-x(A)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The proof of this theorem using the method of [[entropy compression]] can be found in the paper by Moser and Tardos &lt;ref name="moser:arxiv09"/&gt;

===Symmetric version===
The requirement of an assignment function ''x'' satisfying a set of inequalities in the theorem above is complex and not intuitive. But this requirement can be replaced by three simple conditions:
* &lt;math&gt; \forall A \in \mathcal{A}: |\Gamma(A)| \leq D &lt;/math&gt;, i.e. each event ''A'' depends on at most ''D'' other events,
* &lt;math&gt; \forall A \in \mathcal{A}: \Pr[A] \leq  p &lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the probability of each event ''A'' is at most ''p'',
* &lt;math&gt; e p (D+1) \leq 1 &lt;/math&gt;, where ''e'' is the [[e (mathematical constant)|base of the natural logarithm]].

The version of the Lovász Local Lemma with these three conditions instead of the assignment function ''x'' is called the ''Symmetric Lovász Local Lemma''.  We can also state the ''Symmetric Algorithmic Lovász Local Lemma'':

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; be a finite set of mutually independent random variables and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; be a finite set of events determined by these variables as before. If the above three conditions hold then there exists an assignment of values to the variables &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; avoiding all of the events in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt;.

Moreover, the randomized algorithm described above resamples an event &lt;math&gt; A \in \mathcal{A} &lt;/math&gt; at most an expected &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{D}&lt;/math&gt; times before it finds such an evaluation. Thus the expected total number of resampling steps and therefore the expected runtime of the algorithm is at most &lt;math&gt;\frac{n}{D}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==
The following example illustrates how the algorithmic version of the Lovász Local Lemma can be applied to a simple problem.

Let Φ be a [[Conjunctive normal form|CNF]] formula over variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', containing ''n'' clauses, and with at least ''k'' [[Literal (mathematical logic)|literals]] in each clause, and with each variable ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' appearing in at most &lt;math&gt;\frac{2^k}{ke} &lt;/math&gt; clauses. Then, Φ is satisfiable.

This statement can be proven easily using the symmetric version of the Algorithmic Lovász Local Lemma. Let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the set of mutually independent random variables &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P} &lt;/math&gt; which are sampled [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|uniformly at random]].

Firstly, we truncate each clause in Φ to contain exactly ''k'' literals. Since each clause is a disjunction, this does not harm satisfiability, for if we can find a satisfying assignment for the truncated formula, it can easily be extended to a satisfying assignment for the original formula by reinserting the truncated literals.

Now, define a bad event ''A&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' for each clause in Φ, where ''A&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the event that clause ''j'' in Φ is unsatisfied by the current assignment. Since each clause contains ''k'' literals (and therefore ''k'' variables) and since all variables are sampled uniformly at random, we can bound the probability of each bad event by

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr[A_j] = p = 2^{-k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since each variable can appear in at most &lt;math&gt; \frac{2^k}{ke}&lt;/math&gt; clauses and there are ''k'' variables in each clause, each bad event ''A&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' can depend on at most

:&lt;math&gt; D = k\left(\frac{2^k}{ke}-1\right) \leq \frac{2^k}{e} -1 &lt;/math&gt;

other events. Therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;D+1 \leq \frac{2^k}{e},&lt;/math&gt;

multiplying both sides by ''ep'' we get:

:&lt;math&gt; ep(D+1) \leq e 2^{-k} \frac{2^k}{e} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

it follows by the symmetric Lovász Local Lemma that the probability of a random assignment to ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' satisfying all clauses in Φ is non-zero and hence such an assignment must exist.

Now, the Algorithmic Lovász Local Lemma actually allows us to efficiently compute such an assignment by applying the algorithm described above. The algorithm proceeds as follows:

It starts with a random [[truth value]] assignment to the variables ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' sampled uniformly at random. While there exists a clause in Φ that is unsatisfied, it randomly picks an unsatisfied clause ''C'' in Φ and assigns a new truth value to all variables that appear in ''C'' chosen uniformly at random. Once all clauses in Φ are satisfied, the algorithm returns the current assignment. Hence, the Algorithmic Lovász Local Lemma proves that this algorithm has an expected runtime of at most

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{n}{\frac{2^k}{e}-k} &lt;/math&gt;

steps on CNF formulas that satisfy the two conditions above. A stronger version of the above statement is proven by Moser,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|title=A constructive proof of the Lovász Local Lemma|first=Robin A.|last=Moser|year=2008|eprint=0810.4812|class=cs.DS}}.&lt;/ref&gt; see also Berman, Karpinski and Scott.&lt;ref&gt;Piotr Berman, Marek Karpinski and Alexander D. Scott, Approximation Hardness and Satisfiability of Bounded Occurrence Instances of SAT
], [http://eccc.hpi-web.de/report/2003/022/ ECCC TR 03-022(2003)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The algorithm is similar to [[WalkSAT]] which is used to solve general [[boolean satisfiability problem]]s. The main difference is that in [[WalkSAT]], after the unsatisfied clause ''C'' is selected, a  ''single'' variable in ''C'' is selected at random and has its value flipped (which can be viewed as selecting uniformly among only &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; rather than all &lt;math&gt;2^k&lt;/math&gt; value assignments to  ''C'').

==Applications==
As mentioned before, the Algorithmic Version of the Lovász Local Lemma applies to most problems for which the general Lovász Local Lemma is used as a proof technique. Some of these problems are discussed in the following articles:

* [[Probabilistic proofs of non-probabilistic theorems]]
* [[Random graph]]

==Parallel version==
The algorithm described above lends itself well to parallelization, since resampling two independent events &lt;math&gt; A,B \in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. &lt;math&gt; \text{vbl}(A) \cap \text{vbl}(B) = \emptyset &lt;/math&gt;, in parallel is equivalent to resampling ''A'', ''B'' sequentially. Hence, at each iteration of the main loop one can determine the maximal set of independent and satisfied events ''S'' and resample all events in ''S'' in parallel.

Under the assumption that the assignment function ''x'' satisfies the slightly stronger conditions:

:&lt;math&gt; \forall A \in \mathcal{A} : \Pr[A] \leq (1 - \varepsilon) x(A) \prod_{B \in \Gamma(A)} (1-x(B)) &lt;/math&gt;

for some ε &gt; 0 Moser and Tardos proved that the parallel algorithm achieves a better runtime complexity. In this case, the parallel version of the algorithm takes an expected

:&lt;math&gt; O\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon} \log \sum_{A \in \mathcal{A}} \frac{x(A)}{1-x(A)}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

steps before it terminates.  The parallel version of the algorithm can be seen as a special case of the sequential algorithm shown above, and so this result also holds for the sequential case.

In recreational mathematics, '''arithmetic billiards''' provide a geometrical method to determine the [[least common multiple]] and the [[greatest common divisor]] of two natural numbers by making use of reflections inside a rectangle whose sides are the two given numbers. This is an easy example of trajectory analysis of [[dynamical billiards]].

== The arithmetic billiard path==

[[File:Arithmetic-billiard-40-10.jpg|alt=The arithmetic billiard for the numbers 10 and 40.|right|thumb|300x300px|The arithmetic billiard for the numbers 10 and 40.]]

Consider a rectangle with integer sides, and construct a path inside this rectangle as follows: 

* start in a corner, and move along the straight line which makes a 45° angle with the sides; 
* every time that the path hits a side, reflect it with the same angle (the path makes either a left or a right 90° turn);
* eventually (i.e. after a finite number of reflections) the path hits a corner and there it stops. 

If one side length divides the other, the path is a [[zigzag]] consisting of one or more segments.
Else, the path has self-intersections and consists of segments of various lengths in two orthogonal directions.
In general, the path is the intersection of the rectangle with a grid of squares (oriented at 45° w.r.t. the rectangle sides).

== Arithmetical features of the path ==

[[File:Arithmetic-billiard-8-3.jpg|alt=The arithmetic billiard for the numbers 3 and 8.|right|thumb|300x300px|The arithmetic billiard for the numbers 3 and 8: the greatest common divisor is 1, the least common multiple is 24.]] 

Call &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; the side lengths of the rectangle, and divide this into &lt;math&gt;a\cdot b&lt;/math&gt; unit squares. The ''least common multiple'' &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of unit squares crossed by the arithmetic billiard path or, equivalently, the length of the path divided by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, the path goes through each unit square if and only if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are [[coprime]].

Suppose that none of the two side lengths divides the other. Then the first segment of the arithmetic billiard path contains the point of self-intersection which is closest to the starting point. The ''greatest common divisor'' &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; is the number of unit squares crossed by the first segment of the path up to that point of self-intersection.

The ''number of bouncing points'' for the arithmetic billiard path on the two sides of length &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)/b-1&lt;/math&gt;, and similarly &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)/a-1&lt;/math&gt; for the two sides of length &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are coprime, then the total number of contact points between the path and the perimeter of the rectangle (i.e. the bouncing points plus starting and ending corner) equals &lt;math&gt;a+b&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''ending corner'' of the path is opposite to the starting corner if and only if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are exactly divisible by the same power of two (for example, if they are both odd), else it is one of the two adjacent corners, according to whether &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; or  &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; has more factors &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; in its [[prime factorisation]].

The path is ''symmetric'': if the starting and the ending corner are opposite, then the path is pointsymmetric w.r.t. the center of the rectangle, else it is symmetric with respect to the bisector of the side connecting the starting and the ending corner.

The contact points between the arithmetic billiard path and the rectangle perimeter are evenly distributed: the distance along the perimeter (i.e. possibly going around the corner) between two such neighbouring points equals &lt;math&gt;2\gcd(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Set coordinates in the rectangle such that the starting point is &lt;math&gt;(0,0)&lt;/math&gt; and the opposite corner is &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;. Then any point on the arithmetic billiard path which has integer coordinates has the property that the sum of the coordinates is even (the parity cannot change by moving along diagonals of unit squares). The points of self-intersection of the path, the bouncing points, and the starting and ending corner are exactly the points in the rectangle whose coordinates are multiples of &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; and such that the sum of the coordinates is an even multiple of &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;.

== Ideas of proof ==

[[File:Arithmetic-billiard-reflection.jpg|alt=Reflecting the billiard.|right|thumb|300x300px|By reflecting the billiard, we can visualize the path as a straight line. In this example the ratio of the two given numbers is 2/3.]] 

'''Reflecting the billiard:''' Consider a square with side &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;. By displaying multiple copies of the original rectangle (with mirror symmetry) we can visualise the arithmetic billiard path as a diagonal of that square. In other words, we can think of reflecting the rectangle rather than the path segments.

'''Reducing to the coprime case:''' It is convenient to rescale the rectangle dividing &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; by their greatest common divisor, operation which does not alter the geometry of the path (e.g. the number of bouncing points).

'''Reversing the time:''' The motion of the path is “time reversible”, meaning that if the path is currently traversing one particular unit square
(in a particular direction), then there is absolutely no doubt from which unit square and from which direction it just came&lt;ref name="Tanton"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== One generalisation ==

[[File:Arithmetic-billiard-35-14.jpg|alt=TODO.|right|thumb|300x300px|A periodic path in the generalised arithmetic billiard with sides 35 and 14.]] 

If we allow the starting point of the path to be any point in the rectangle with integer coordinates, then there are also periodic paths unless the rectangle sides are coprime. The length of any periodic path equals &lt;math&gt;2\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)\cdot \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3032">'''Barlow's formula''' relates the internal pressure that a [[pipe (material)|pipe]]&lt;ref&gt;Or pressure vessel, or other cylindrical pressure containment structure.&lt;/ref&gt; can withstand to its dimensions and the [[Strength of materials|strength of its material]].

:&lt;math&gt;P=\frac {2St} {D}&lt;/math&gt;

where

: ''P'' = pressure
: ''S'' = allowable stress
: ''t'' = wall thickness
: ''D'' = outside diameter

This formula figures prominently in the design of [[Autoclave (industrial)|autoclaves]] and other [[pressure vessel]]s.

The formula is named after [[Peter Barlow (mathematician)|Peter Barlow]], an English [[mathematician]].

==Other formulations==

The design of a complex pressure containment system involves much more than the application of Barlow's formula. For [[pressure vessel]]s, design codes such as the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers#ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC)|ASME code]] stipulate the requirements for design and testing.{{cn|date=March 2014}}&lt;!-- well, maybe, but the American SME "code" does not seem to have any salience to countries outside the US, and WIkipedia is written for a global audience.  --&gt;
 
The formula is also common in the pipeline industry to verify that pipe used for gathering, transmission, and distribution lines can safely withstand operating pressures. The design factor is multiplied by the resulting pressure which gives the maximum operating pressure (MAOP) for the pipeline. This design factor is dependent on class locations which are defined in [[US Department of Transportation|DOT]] Part 192. There are four class locations corresponding to four design factors:{{cn|date=March 2014}}
*Class 1:  An offshore area or any class location unit that has 10 or fewer buildings intended for human occupancy.  The Class 1 design factor is 0.72.
*Class 2: any class location that has more than 10 but fewer than 46 buildings intended for human occupancy; design factor  0.60.
*Class 3: any location that has more than 46 or more buildings intended for human occupancy or any area where the pipeline lies within 100 yards (91 meters) of a building or a small, well-defined outdoor area (such as a playground, recreation area, outdoor theater, or place of public assembly) that is occupied by 20 or more persons at least five days a week for 10 weeks in any 12-month period—weeks need not be consecutive.  design factor 0.50.
*Class 4: any class location unit where buildings with four or more stories above the ground are prevalent; design factor 0.40.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8034">In [[complex analysis]], a branch of mathematics, the '''Casorati–Weierstrass theorem''' describes the behaviour of [[holomorphic function]]s near their [[essential singularity|essential singularities]]. It is named for [[Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstrass]] and [[Felice Casorati (mathematician)|Felice Casorati]]. In Russian literature it is called [[Yulian Sokhotski|Sokhotski's]] theorem.

==Formal statement of the theorem==
Start with some [[open set|open subset]] &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; in the [[complex number|complex plane]] containing the number &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;, and a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; that is [[holomorphic function|holomorphic]] on &lt;math&gt;U\ \backslash\ \{z_0\}&lt;/math&gt;, but has an [[essential singularity]] at &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;. The ''Casorati–Weierstrass theorem'' then states that 
:if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is any [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; contained in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(V\ \backslash\ \{z_0\})&lt;/math&gt; is [[dense set|dense]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

This can also be stated as follows: 
:for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0, \delta &gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and complex number &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a complex number &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;|z-z_0|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|f(z)-w|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;.

Or in still more descriptive terms:
:&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; comes arbitrarily close to ''any'' complex value in every neighbourhood of &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt;.

The theorem is considerably strengthened by [[Picard's great theorem]], which states, in the notation above, that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; assumes ''every'' complex value, with one possible exception, infinitely often on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

In the case that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is an [[entire function]] and &lt;math&gt;a=\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the theorem says that the values &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt;
approach every complex number and &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, as &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; tends to infinity.
It is remarkable that this does not hold for  [[holomorphic map]]s in higher dimensions,
as the famous example of [[Pierre Fatou]] shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=P.|last=Fatou|title=Sur les fonctions meromorphes de deux variables|journal=Comptes rendus|volume=175|year=1922|pages=862,1030.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Essential singularity.png|right|220px|thumb|Plot of the function exp(1/''z''), centered on the essential singularity at ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The hue represents the complex argument, the luminance represents the absolute value. This plot shows how approaching the essential singularity from different directions yields different behaviors (as opposed to a pole, which would be uniformly white).]]

==Examples==
The function ''f''(''z'') = [[exponential function|exp]](1/''z'') has an essential singularity at 0, but the function ''g''(''z'') = 1/''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; does not (it has a [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] at 0).

Consider the function

: &lt;math&gt;f(z)=e^{1/z}.&lt;/math&gt;

This function has the following [[Taylor series]] about the [[essential singularity|essential singular point]] at 0:

: &lt;math&gt;f(z)=\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}z^{-n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Because &lt;math&gt;f'(z) =\frac{-e^{\frac{1}{z}}}{z^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; exists for all points ''z''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 we know that ''ƒ''(''z'') is analytic in a [[punctured neighborhood]] of ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. Hence it is an [[isolated singularity]], as well as being an [[essential singularity]]. &lt;!-- (a pole that is a cluster point of poles is essential, hence false remark:) like all other essential singularities. --&gt;

Using a change of variable to [[polar coordinates]] &lt;math&gt;z=re^{i \theta }&lt;/math&gt; our function, ''ƒ''(''z'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sup&gt;1/''z''&lt;/sup&gt; becomes:

: &lt;math&gt;f(z)=e^{\frac{1}{r}e^{-i\theta}}=e^{\frac{1}{r}\cos(\theta)}e^{-\frac{1}{r}i \sin(\theta)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the [[absolute value]] of both sides:

: &lt;math&gt;\left| f(z) \right| = \left| e^{\frac{1}{r}\cos \theta} \right| \left| e^{-\frac{1}{r}i \sin(\theta)} \right | =e^{\frac{1}{r}\cos \theta}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for values of ''θ'' such that cos&amp;nbsp;''θ''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, we have &lt;math&gt;f(z)\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;r \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;, and for &lt;math&gt;\cos \theta &lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(z) \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;r \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Consider what happens, for example when ''z'' takes values on a circle of diameter 1/''R'' tangent to the imaginary axis. This circle is given by ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(1/''R'')&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;''θ''. Then,

: &lt;math&gt;f(z) = e^{R} \left[ \cos \left( R\tan \theta \right) - i \sin \left( R\tan \theta \right) \right] &lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;\left| f(z) \right| = e^R.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,&lt;math&gt;\left| f(z) \right|&lt;/math&gt; may take any positive value other than zero by the appropriate choice of ''R''. As &lt;math&gt;z \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; on the circle, &lt;math&gt; \theta \rightarrow \frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; with ''R'' fixed. So this part of the equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\left[ \cos \left( R \tan \theta \right) - i \sin \left( R \tan \theta \right) \right] &lt;/math&gt;

takes on all values on the [[unit circle]] infinitely often. Hence ''f''(''z'') takes on the value of every number in the [[complex plane]] except for zero infinitely often.

==Proof of the theorem==
A short proof of the theorem is as follows:

Take as given that function ''f'' is [[meromorphic function|meromorphic]] on some punctured neighborhood ''V''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;{''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}, and that ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is an essential singularity. Assume by way of contradiction that some value ''b'' exists that the function can never get close to; that is: assume that there is some complex value ''b'' and some ε&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that |''f''(''z'') &amp;minus; ''b''| ≥ ε for all ''z'' in ''V'' at which ''f'' is defined.

Then the new function:

:&lt;math&gt;g(z) = \frac{1}{f(z) - b}&lt;/math&gt;

must be holomorphic on ''V''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;{''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}, with [[Zero (complex analysis)|zeroes]] at the [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of ''f'', and bounded by 1/ε. It can therefore be analytically continued (or continuously extended, or holomorphically extended) to ''all'' of ''V'' by [[Removable singularity#Riemann's theorem|Riemann's analytic continuation theorem]]. So the original function can be expressed in terms of ''g'':

:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \frac{1}{g(z)} + b&lt;/math&gt;

for all arguments ''z'' in ''V''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;{''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}. Consider the two possible cases for

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{z \to z_0} g(z).&lt;/math&gt;

If the limit is 0, then ''f'' has a [[Pole (complex analysis)|pole]] at ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;. If the limit is not 0, then ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[removable singularity]] of ''f''&amp;nbsp;. Both possibilities contradict the assumption that the point ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is an [[essential singularity]] of the function ''f''&amp;nbsp;. Hence the assumption is false and the theorem holds.

==History==
The history of this important theorem is described by
[[Edward Collingwood|Collingwood]] and [[Arthur J. Lohwater|Lohwater]].&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite book|first1=E|last1=Collingwood|first2=A |last2=Lohwater|title=The theory of cluster sets|
publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was published by Weierstrass in 1876 (in German) and by Sokhotski in 1868 in his Master thesis (in Russian).
So it was called Sokhotski's theorem in the Russian literature and Weierstrass's theorem in
the Western literature. 
The same theorem was published by Casorati in 1868, and
by Briot and Bouquet in the ''first edition'' of their book (1859).&lt;ref name="BB"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ch|last1= Briot|
first2=C|last2=Bouquet|
title=Theorie des fonctions doublement periodiques, et en particulier, des fonctions elliptiques|place=Paris|year=1859}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Briot and Bouquet ''removed'' this theorem from the second edition (1875).

A (theoretical) '''continuous repayment mortgage''' is a mortgage loan paid by means of a continuous annuity.

Mortgages (i.e., mortgage loans) are generally settled over a period of years by a series of fixed regular payments commonly referred to as an [[Annuity (finance theory)|annuity]]. Each payment accumulates [[compound interest]] from time of deposit to the end of the mortgage timespan at which point the sum of the payments with their accumulated interest equals the value of the loan with interest compounded over the entire timespan. Given loan ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, per period interest rate i, number of periods ''n'' and fixed per period payment ''x'', the end of term balancing equation is:

::&lt;math&gt;P_0(1+i)^{n} = \sum_{k=1}^n  x(1+i)^{n-k}=\frac{x[(1+i)^n - 1]}{i}&lt;/math&gt;

Summation can be computed using the standard formula for summation of a [[geometric sequence]].

In a (theoretical) continuous-repayment mortgage the payment interval is narrowed indefinitely until the discrete interval process becomes continuous and the fixed interval payments become—in effect—a literal cash "flow" at a fixed annual rate. In this case, given loan ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, annual interest rate ''r'', loan timespan ''T'' (years) and annual rate ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[infinitesimal]] cash flow elements ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;''δt'' accumulate [[continuously compounded interest]] from time t to the end of the loan timespan at which point the balancing equation is:

::&lt;math&gt;P_0e^{rT}=\int\limits_{0}^{T} M_ae^{r(T-t)}\, dt=\frac{M_a(e^{rT}-1)}{r}.&lt;/math&gt;

Summation of the cash flow elements and accumulated interest is effected by integration as shown. It is assumed that compounding interval and payment interval are equal—i.e., compounding of interest always occurs at the same time as payment is deducted.&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking compounding occurs momentarily before payment is deducted so that interest is calculated on the balance as it was before deduction of the period payment.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the timespan of the loan the time continuous mortgage balance function obeys a first order [[linear differential equation]] (LDE)&lt;ref&gt;[[#CFP|Beckwith]] p.&amp;nbsp;116: ''"Technically speaking, the underlying equation is known as an ordinary, linear, first order, inhomogenous, scalar differential equation with a boundary condition."''&lt;/ref&gt; and an alternative derivation thereof may be obtained by solving the LDE using the method of [[Laplace transforms]].

Application of the equation yields a number of results relevant to the financial process which it describes. Although this article focuses primarily on mortgages, the methods employed are relevant to any situation in which payment or saving is effected by a regular stream of fixed interval payments (annuity).

==Derivation of time-continuous equation==
The classical formula for the present value of a series of ''n'' fixed monthly payments amount ''x'' invested at a monthly interest rate ''i''% is:

:&lt;math&gt;P_v(n) = \frac{x(1 - (1 + i)^{-n})}{i}&lt;/math&gt;

The formula may be re-arranged to determine the monthly payment ''x'' on a loan of amount ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; taken out for a period of ''n'' months at a monthly interest rate of&amp;nbsp;''i''%:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{P_0\cdot i}{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}}&lt;/math&gt;

We begin with a small adjustment of the formula: replace ''i'' with ''r''/''N'' where ''r'' is the annual interest rate and ''N'' is the annual frequency of compounding periods (''N'' = 12 for monthly payments). Also replace ''n'' with ''NT'' where ''T'' is the total loan period in years. In this more general form of the equation we are calculating ''x''(''N'') as the fixed payment corresponding to frequency ''N''. For example if ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;365, ''x'' corresponds to a daily fixed payment. As ''N'' increases, ''x''(''N'') decreases but the product ''N''·''x''(''N'') approaches a limiting value as will be shown:

:&lt;math&gt;x(N) = \frac{P_0\cdot r}{N(1 - (1 + \frac{r}{N})^{-NT})}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;N\cdot x(N) = \frac{P_0\cdot r}{1 - (1 + \frac{r}{N})^{-NT}}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that ''N''·''x''(''N'') is simply the amount paid per year &amp;ndash; in effect an annual repayment rate ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;.

It is well established that:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{N\to\infty}\left(1+\frac{r}{N}\right)^{Nt}=e^{rt}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[#CFP|Beckwith]] p.115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#A&amp;T|Munem and Foulis]] p.273&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying the same principle to the formula for annual repayment, we can determine a limiting value:

:&lt;math&gt;M_a=\lim_{N\to\infty}N\cdot x(N)=\lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{P_0\cdot r}{1 - (1 + \frac{r}{N})^{-NT}}=\frac{P_0\cdot r}{1 - e^{-rT}}. &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[#CFP|Beckwith:]] Equation (29) p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point in the orthodox formula for present value, the latter is more properly represented as a function of annual compounding frequency ''N'' and time&amp;nbsp;''t'':

:&lt;math&gt;P_v(N,t)=\frac{N\cdot x(N)(1 - (1 + \frac{r}{N})^{-Nt})}{r}&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the limiting expression developed above we may write present value as a purely time dependent function:

:&lt;math&gt;P_v(t)=\lim_{N\to\infty}P_v(N,t)=\frac{M_a}{r}(1-e^{-rt})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: {{Cite book

[[File:mortgage balance.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 1]]Noting that the balance due ''P''(''t'') on a loan ''t'' years after its inception is simply the present value of the contributions for the remaining period (i.e. ''T''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''t''), we determine:

:&lt;math&gt;P(t) = \frac{M_a}{r}(1 - e^{-r(T-t)})=\frac{P_0(1 - e^{-r(T-t)})}{1 - e^{-rT}}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[#CFP|Beckwith:]] Equation (31) p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

The graph(s) in the diagram are a comparison of balance due on a mortgage (1 million for 20 years @ ''r'' = 10%) calculated firstly according to the above time continuous model and secondly using the Excel PV function. As may be seen the curves are virtually indistinguishable &amp;ndash; calculations effected using the model differ from those effected using the Excel PV function by a mere 0.3% (max). The data from which the graph(s) were derived can be viewed [[Media:Mortgage Balance model data.pdf|here.]]

==Comparison with similar physical systems==

Define the "reverse time" variable ''z'' = ''T''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''t''. (''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''T'' and ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''T'', ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0). Then:
[[File:RC-circuit2.png|right|200px|thumb| Plotted on a time axis normalized to system time constant ('''τ''' =&amp;nbsp;1/''r'' years and '''τ''' =&amp;nbsp;''RC'' seconds respectively) the mortgage balance function in a CRM (green) is a mirror image of the step response curve for an RC circuit (blue).The vertical axis is normalized to system asymptote i.e. perpetuity value M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;/r for the CRM and applied voltage V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for the RC circuit.]]

: &lt;math&gt;P(z) = \frac{M_a}{r}(1 - e^{-rz}).&lt;/math&gt;

This may be recognized as a solution to the "reverse time" differential equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{M_a}{r} = \frac{1}{r}\frac{dP(z)}{dz} + P(z).&lt;/math&gt;

Electrical/electronic engineers and physicists will be familiar with an equation of this nature: it is an exact analogue of the type of differential equation which governs (for example) the charging of a capacitor in an RC circuit.

: &lt;math&gt;V_0 = RC\frac{dV(t)}{dt}+V(t).&lt;/math&gt;

The key characteristics of such equations are explained in detail at [[RC_circuit#Time-domain_considerations|RC circuits]]. For home owners with mortgages the important parameter to keep in mind is the [[time constant]] of the equation which is simply the reciprocal of the annual interest rate&amp;nbsp;''r''.  So (for example) the time constant when the interest rate is 10% is 10 years and the period of a home loan should be determined &amp;ndash; within the bounds of affordability &amp;ndash; as a minimum multiple of this if the objective is to minimise interest paid on the loan.

==Mortgage difference and differential equation==

The conventional [[difference equation]] for a mortgage loan is relatively straightforward to derive - balance due in each successive period is the previous balance plus per period interest less the per period fixed payment.

Given an '''annual''' interest rate ''r'' and a borrower with an '''annual''' payment capability ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; (divided into N equal payments made at time intervals Δ''t'' where Δ''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''N''&amp;nbsp;years), we may write:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  P_{t+\Delta t} &amp; = P_t+(rP_t-M_N)\Delta t\\[12pt]
\dfrac{P_{t+\Delta t}-P_t}{\Delta t} &amp; = rP_t-M_N
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If ''N'' is increased indefinitely so that Δ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0, we obtain the continuous time differential equation:

:&lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}P(t)\over\operatorname{d}t}=rP(t)-M_a &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[#CFP|Beckwith:]] Equation (25) p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#GIT|Hackman:]] Equation (2) p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that for there to be a continually diminishing mortgage balance, the following inequality must hold:

:&lt;math&gt;P_0 \leqslant \frac{M_a}{r} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Where equality holds, the mortgage becomes a [[perpetuity]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the same as ''P''(0) – the original loan amount or loan balance at time&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

===Solving the difference equation===
We begin by re-writing the difference equation in recursive form:

:&lt;math&gt;P_{t+\Delta t}=P_t(1+r\Delta t)-M_N\Delta t\; &lt;/math&gt;

Using the notation ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to indicate the mortgage balance after ''n'' periods, we may apply the recursion relation iteratively to determine ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;P_1 = P_0(1+r\Delta t)-M_N\Delta t\;&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P_2 &amp;= [P_0(1+r\Delta t)-M_N\Delta t](1+r\Delta t)-M_N\Delta t\\
&amp;= P_0(1+r\Delta t)^2 - M_N\Delta t(1+r\Delta t)-M_N\Delta t
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It can already be seen that the terms containing ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; form a geometric series with common ratio 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''r''Δ&amp;nbsp;''t''. This enables us to write a general expression for ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
P_n&amp;=P_0(1+r\Delta t)^n-\sum_{k=1}^{n} M_N\Delta t(1+r\Delta t)^{n-k} \\
&amp;=P_0(1+r\Delta t)^n-\dfrac{M_N\Delta t[(1+r\Delta t)^n - 1]}{r\Delta t}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally noting that ''r''&amp;nbsp;Δ&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''i'' the per-period interest rate and &lt;math&gt;M_N\Delta t=x&lt;/math&gt; the per period payment, the expression may be written in conventional form:

:&lt;math&gt;P_n=P_0(1+i)^n-\dfrac{x[(1+i)^n - 1]}{i}&lt;/math&gt;

If the loan timespan is m periods, then ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and we obtain the standard present value formula:

:&lt;math&gt;P_0=\dfrac{x[1-(1+i)^{-m}]}{i}&lt;/math&gt;

===Solving the differential equation===
:&lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{d}P(t)\over\operatorname{d}t}=rP(t)-M_a &lt;/math&gt;

One method of solving the equation is to obtain the [[Laplace transform]] ''P''(''s''):

:&lt;math&gt;P(s)=\frac{M_a}{s(r-s)}=\frac{M_a}{r} \times \frac{(-r)}{s(s-r)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using a [[Laplace_transform#Table_of_selected_Laplace_transforms|table of Laplace transforms]] and their time domain equivalents, ''P''(''t'') may be determined:

:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=\frac{M_a}{r}(1-e^{rt}).&lt;/math&gt;

In order to fit this solution to the particular start and end points of the mortgage function we need to introduce a time shift of ''T'' years (''T'' = loan period) to ensure the function reaches zero at the end of the loan period:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; P(t) = \frac{M_a}{r}(1-e^{r(t-T)}) \\[8pt]
&amp; P_0 = \frac{M_a}{r}(1-e^{-rT})\Rightarrow\frac{M_a}{r}=\frac{P_0}{1-e^{-rT}} \\[8pt]
\Rightarrow &amp; P(t) = \frac{P_0(1-e^{-r(T-t)})}{1-e^{-rT}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Note that both the original solution and "time-shifted" version satisfy the original differential equation whence both are derived. 

Similar to the expression derived above for ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in the difference equation, the expression for ''P''(''t'') may be written in the following algebraically equivalent form:

:&lt;math&gt;P(t) = P_0e^{rt} - \frac{M_a}{r}(e^{rt}-1)&lt;/math&gt;

==Calculation of accumulated interest and principal payments==

Re-arranging the original differential equation we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;M_a = rP(t) - \frac{dP(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating both sides of the equation yields:

:&lt;math&gt;M_a.t = \int_0^t rP(t)\,dt \,  - \int_0^t \frac{dP(t)}{dt}\,dt \, &lt;/math&gt;

The first integral on the right hand side determines the accumulated interest payments from time of inception to time t whilst the second determines the accumulated principal payments over the same period. The sum of these interest and principal payments must equal the cumulative fixed payments at time ''t'' i.e. ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;''t''. Evaluating the first integral on the right we obtain an expression for ''I''(''t''), the interest paid:

:&lt;math&gt;I(t)=M_at-\frac{M_a(e^{rt}-1)}{re^{rT}}&lt;/math&gt;

Unsurprisingly the second integral evaluates to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''P''(''t'') and therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;I(t)=M_at-P_0+P(t) \,&lt;/math&gt;

The reader may easily verify that this expression is algebraically identical to the one above.

==Loan cost factor==

The cost of a loan is simply the annual rate multiplied by loan period:

:&lt;math&gt; C = M_aT= \frac{P_0 rT}{1-e^{-rT}}  &lt;/math&gt;

Let ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''rT''. Then we may define loan cost factor ''C''(''s'') such that ''C'' = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''C''(s) i.e.: ''C''(''s'') is the cost per unit of currency loaned.

:&lt;math&gt; C(s) = \frac{rT}{1-e^{-rT}}=\frac{s}{1-e^{-s}} &lt;/math&gt;

The function ''C''(''s'') is characterised by having a limiting value of 1 when ''s'' is close to zero since for small values of ''s'', exp(&amp;minus;''s'')&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''s'' and the denominator simplifies to&amp;nbsp;''s''. Also when ''s'' is very large, exp(&amp;minus;''s'') is small so ''C''(''s'')&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''s'' and thus loan cost ''C''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''rT'' (''rT''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0).

By way of example, consider a loan of 1000000 at 10% repaid over 20 years. Then ''s''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.1&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;20&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2.

:&lt;math&gt; C = 1000000 \times \frac{2}{1-e^{-2}} \approx 2.313\times10^6  &lt;/math&gt;

The product rT is an easily obtained but important parameter in determining loan cost according to the equation C=P&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;xC(s). This is best illustrated by plotting the cost factor function for s values in domain [0;5]. The linear behaviour of the function for higher values of ''s'' is clear.

==Equivalent simple interest cost factor==
For a fixed term loan of t years, we may compare the above loan cost factor against an equivalent simple interest cost factor ''1+s&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' where ''s&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;=r&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;t'' and ''r&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the equivalent simple interest rate:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{s}{1-e^{-s}}=1+s_e &lt;/math&gt;

It is straightforward to determine ''s&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' in terms of s. Dividing by loan time period t will then give the equivalent simple interest rate. More challenging is the reverse determination of s given ''s&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''.

In his book ''Problem Solving with True Basic'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#BDH|Hahn]] p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Dr B.D. Hahn has a short section on certain 'hire purchase' schemes in which ''interest is calculated in advance in one lump sum, which is added to the capital amount, the sum being equally divided over the repayment period. The buyer, however, is often under the impression that the interest is calculated on a reducing balance.''

The above example is adapted from the one given in Dr Hahn's book in which he employs the Newton-Raphson algorithm to solve the same problem albeit for a discrete interval (i.e. monthly) repayment loan over the same time period (3 years). As with many similar examples the discrete interval problem and its solution is closely approximated by calculations based on the continuous repayment model - Dr Hahn's solution for interest rate is 40.8% as compared to the 41.6% calculated above.

==Period of a loan==

If a borrower can afford an annual repayment rate ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;, then we can re-arrange the formula for calculating ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; to obtain an expression for the time period ''T'' of a given loan ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; M_a = \frac{P_0 r}{1-e^{-rT}} \\[8pt]
\Rightarrow &amp; T = \frac{1}{r}\ln\frac{M_a}{M_a-P_0 r} = -\frac{1}{r}\ln\left(1 - \frac{P_0 r}{M_a} \right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Minimum payment ratio==

The minimum payment ratio of a loan is the ratio of minimum possible payment rate to actual payment rate. The minimum possible payment rate is that which just covers the loan interest – a borrower would in theory pay this amount forever because there is never any decrease in loan capital. We will use the letter ''k'' to denote minimum payment ratio:

:&lt;math&gt; k = \frac{M_\min}{M_a} = \frac{P_0r}{M_a} &lt;/math&gt;

Now we may consider a small re-arrangement of the equation for loan period&amp;nbsp;''T'':

:&lt;math&gt; T = -\frac{1}{r}\ln\left(1-\frac{P_0r}{M_a}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; rT = s(k) = -\ln(1-k) \; &lt;/math&gt;

Plotting ''s''(''k'') against ''k'' gives a very graphic demonstration of why it is a good idea to keep the ''k'' value well below the asymptote at ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 since in the vicinity thereof, ''s''(''k'') increases sharply and therefore so does loan cost which is in turn an increasing function of parameter ''s'' (''rT'' product).

=="Half-life" of a loan==

A useful parameter of the mortgage model is the "half-life" of the loan which is the time it takes for the balance on the loan to reach half its original value. To determine the "half-life" we may write:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P(t)}{P_0}=\frac{1}{2}=\frac{1-e^{-r(T-t)}}{1-e^{-rT}}&lt;/math&gt;

Solving for ''t'' we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;t_{\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{1}{r}\ln\left(\frac{1+e^{rT}}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[#CFP|Beckwith:]] Equation (23) p. 122. Beckwith uses this formula in relation to a sinking fund but notes (p.124) that the formula is identical for an amortization process.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example applying the formula to some test data (loan of 1 million at 10% for 20 years) we obtain the half-life as 14.34 years. If in practice the loan is being repaid via monthly instalments, the decimal portion can be converted to months and rounded so this answer would equate to 172 months.

==Calculation of interest rate==

In the discrete time interval model, calculation of a mortgage based interest rate given the remaining parameters has not been possible using analytic methods. Implementations such as the Excel "rate" function employ a numerical "trial and improvement" method to determine interest rate. At first glance this would also seem to be the case for the continuous repayment model. Given:

:&lt;math&gt;P_0=\frac{M_a}{r}(1-e^{-rT})&lt;/math&gt;

we may write:

:&lt;math&gt;rP_0=M_a(1-e^{-rT})\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow rP_0-M_a+M_ae^{-rT}=0&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Interest rate plot.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Figure 1]]In order to visualise the above as a function of ''r'' (for which we wish to determine zeroes), it will be helpful to select numerical values of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T'' as 10000, 6000 and 3 respectively and plot as shown at right. It will be noted that the function has a minimum value which can be determined by differentiation:

:&lt;math&gt;f'(r)=0\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow P_0-M_aTe^{-rT}=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow r=\frac{1}{T}\ln{\frac{M_aT}{P_0}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the function is approximately parabolic between the roots at ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and the sought value, we may estimate the required root as:

:&lt;math&gt;r\approx\frac{2}{T}\ln{\frac{M_aT}{P_0}}&lt;/math&gt;

Using this as a starting point, increasingly accurate values for the root may be determined by repeated iterations of the [[Newton–Raphson|Newton–Raphson algorithm]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[#CFP|Beckwith:]] (p.125):''"In the determination of rates of interest for given continuous payment schedules, it is frequently necessary to determine the roots of transcendental functions."''. Beckwith details two methods: Successive substitution and Newton–Raphson. (ps. 126–127).&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r_{1} = r_0 - \frac{f(r_0)}{f'(r_0)}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Some experimentation on [https://web.archive.org/web/20090521145550/http://www.wolframalpha.com// Wolfram Alpha] reveals that an [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+for+r+in+P%3Dm%2Fr*%281-exp%28-r*T%29%29 exact analytical solution] employing the [[Lambert W function|Lambert-W]] or "product log" function can be obtained. Setting ''s'' = ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;''T''/''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;r=\frac{1}{T}\left (W(-se^{-s})+s\right )&lt;/math&gt;

In the region of interest ''W''(&amp;minus;''se''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;) is a bi-valued function. The first value is just &amp;minus;''s'' which yields the trivial solution ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. The second value evaluated within the context of the above formula will provide the required interest rate.

The following table shows calculation of an initial estimate of interest rate followed by a few iterations of the Newton–Raphson algorithm. There is rapid convergence to a solution accurate to several decimal places as may be corroborated against the [[Media:interest rate calc example.pdf|analytical solution]] using the Lambert ''W'' or "productlog" function on Wolfram Alpha.

==Present value and future value formulae==

Corresponding to the standard formula for the present value of a series of fixed monthly payments, we have already established a time continuous analogue:

:&lt;math&gt;P_v(t)=\frac{M_a}{r}(1-e^{-rt}).&lt;/math&gt;

In similar fashion, a future value formula can be determined:

:&lt;math&gt;F_v(t)=\frac{M_a}{r}(e^{rt}-1).&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;See also: {{Cite book

}} p. 22. Older actuarial textbooks refer to "interest convertible momently" and "payments momently" when discussing continuous annuities.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case the annual rate ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is determined from a specified (future) savings or sinking fund target ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; as follows.

:&lt;math&gt;M_a=\lim_{N\to\infty}N\cdot x(N)=\lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{P_T\cdot r}{(1 + \frac{r}{N})^{NT}-1}=\frac{P_T\cdot r}{e^{rT}-1}. &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[#CFP|Beckwith:]] Equation (19) p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

It will be noted that as might be expected:

:&lt;math&gt;F_v(t)=P_v(t) \times e^{rt}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Another way to calculate balance due ''P''(''t'') on a continuous-repayment loan is to subtract the future value (at time&amp;nbsp;''t'') of the payment stream from the future value of the loan (also at time&amp;nbsp;''t''):

:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=P_0 e^{rt}-\frac{M_a}{r}(e^{rt}-1).&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[#CFP|Beckwith:]] Equation (27) p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==

The following example from a school text book&lt;ref&gt;[[#MJG|Glencross]] p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; will illustrate the conceptual difference between a savings annuity based on discrete time intervals (per month in this case) and one based on continuous payment employing the above future value formula:

''On his 30th birthday, an investor decides he wants to accumulate R500000 by his 40th birthday. Starting in one month's time he decides to make equal monthly payments into an account that pays interest at 12% per annum compounded monthly. What monthly payments will he have to make?''

For the sake of brevity, we will solve the "discrete interval" problem using the Excel PMT function:

:&lt;math&gt;x(12) = PMT(1\%, 120, 500000) = 2173.55&lt;/math&gt;

The amount paid annually would therefore be 26082.57.

For a theoretical continuous payment savings annuity we can only calculate an annual ''rate'' of payment:

:&lt;math&gt;M_a=\frac{500000 \times 12\%}{e^{0.12\cdot 10}-1}=25860.77&lt;/math&gt;

At this point there is a temptation to simply divide by 12 to obtain a monthly payment. However this would contradict the primary assumption upon which the "continuous payment" model is based: namely that the annual payment ''rate'' is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;M_a=\lim_{N\to\infty}N\cdot x(N) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Since it is of course impossible for an investor to make an infinitely small payment infinite times per annum, a bank or other lending institution wishing to offer "continuous payment" annuities or mortgages would in practice have to choose a large but finite value of ''N'' (annual frequency of payments) such that the continuous time formula will always be correct to within some minimal pre-specified error margin. For example hourly fixed payments (calculated using the conventional formula) in this example would accumulate to an annual payment of 25861.07 and the error would be &lt;&amp;nbsp;0.02%. If the error margin is acceptable, the hourly payment rate can be more simply determined by dividing ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; by 365&amp;times;24. The (hypothetical) lending institution would then need to ensure its computational resources are sufficient to implement (when required) hourly deductions from customer accounts. In short cash "flow" for continuous payment annuities is to be understood in the very literal sense of the word.

: ''"Monies paid into a fund in the financial world are paid at discrete &amp;ndash; usually equally spaced &amp;ndash; points in calendar time. In the continuous process the payment is made continuously, as one might pour fluid from one container into another, where the rate of payment is the fundamental quantity".''&lt;ref&gt;[[#CFP|Beckwith]] p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table shows how as ''N'' (annual compounding frequency) increases, the ''annual'' payment approaches the limiting value of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;, the annual payment ''rate''. The difference (error) between annual payment and the limiting value is calculated and expressed as a percentage of the limiting value.

&lt;ref&gt;Further worked examples and problems with solutions can be found in Professor Hackman's course notes. See Reference Section.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith (pages 128&amp;ndash;129) provides more complex examples involving interest rate calculation. The interested reader may verify the calculations by entering the resultant transcendental equations on Wolfram Alpha. Note: the line of working before eqn (38) in Beckwith's article is missing a pair of brackets&lt;/ref&gt;

It will be apparent from the above that the concept of a "continuous repayment" mortgage is a somewhat theoretical construct. Whether it has practical value or not is a question that would need to be carefully considered by economists and actuaries. In particular the meaning of an annual repayment ''rate'' must be clearly understood as illustrated in the above example.

However the "continuous payment" model does provide some meaningful insights into the behaviour of the discrete mortgage balance function &amp;ndash; in particular that it is largely governed by a [[time constant]] equal to the reciprocal of r the nominal annual interest rate. And if a mortgage were to be paid off via fixed daily amounts, then balance due calculations effected using the model would &amp;ndash; in general &amp;ndash; be accurate to within a small fraction of a percent. Finally the model demonstrates that it is to the modest advantage of the mortgage holder to increase frequency of payment where practically possible.

'''Delbert Ray Fulkerson''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ʌ|l|k|ər|s|ən}}; August 14, 1924 – January 10, 1976) was an American [[mathematician]] who co-developed the [[Ford{{Ndash}}Fulkerson algorithm]], one of the most well-known [[algorithm]]s to solve the [[maximum flow problem]] in [[Flow network|network]]s.

==Early life and education==
D. R. Fulkerson was born in [[Tamms, Illinois]], the third of six children of Elbert and Emma Fulkerson. Fulkerson became an undergraduate at [[Southern Illinois University]]. His academic career was interrupted by military service during [[World War II]]. Having returned to complete his degree after the war, he went on to do a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in mathematics at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] under the supervision of [[Cyrus Colton MacDuffee|Cyrus MacDuffee]], who was a student of [[L. E. Dickson]]. Fulkerson received his Ph.D. in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/17887/2/Fulkerson_Delbert_Ray_1976.pdf|title=Delbert Ray Fulkerson|publisher=library.cornell.edu|accessdate=2014-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He was then with the mathematics department at the [[RAND Corporation]] until 1971 when he moved to [[Cornell University]] as the Maxwell Upson Professor of Engineering. He remained at Cornell until he committed suicide in 1976.

Fulkerson was the supervisor of [[Jon Folkman]] at RAND and [[Tatsuo Oyama]][http://www.grips.ac.jp/list/en/facultyinfo/oyama_tatsuo/] at GRIPS [http://www.grips.ac.jp/en/].

In 1956, he published his noted paper on the Ford–Fulkerson algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |author2=D. R. Fulkerson
 | year = 1962
 | title = Flows in Networks
 | publisher = Princeton University Press
 | location = Princeton, NJ
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
together with [[L.R. Ford, Jr.]]. In 1979, the renowned [[Fulkerson Prize]] was established which is now awarded every three years for outstanding papers in [[discrete mathematics]] jointly by the [[Mathematical Programming Society]] and the [[American Mathematical Society]].

'''Decimal sequences for cryptography.''' A [[recurring decimal]] such as 1/7=.142857142857... can be considered a periodic series with the digits 142857 in the base 10. In general, such sequences may be written to any base. The maximum period of such a d-sequence (when the base is not necessarily 10) written for 1/q, q prime, is q-1.

A binary d-sequence may be written as:

:a&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; mod q mod 2

As example, the d-sequence for 1/19 is 000011010111100101.

S. Kak has proposed their use for [[error correction]] coding, [[cryptography]] and as [[random sequence]]s. These sequences have fairly good [[autocorrelation]] properties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1882">In [[mathematics]], a [[subset]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of a [[topological space]] is said to be '''dense-in-itself''' if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; contains no [[isolated point]]s.

Every dense-in-itself [[closed set]] is [[perfect set|perfect]]. Conversely, every perfect set is dense-in-itself.

A simple example of a set which is dense-in-itself but not closed (and hence not a perfect set) is the subset of [[irrational numbers]] (considered as a subset of the [[real numbers]]). This set is dense-in-itself because every [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of an irrational number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; contains at least one other irrational number &lt;math&gt;y \neq x&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, this set of irrationals is not closed because every [[rational number]] lies in its [[closure (topology)|closure]]. For similar reasons, the set of rational numbers (also considered as a subset of the [[real numbers]]) is also dense-in-itself but not closed.

The above examples, the irrationals and the rationals, are also [[dense set]]s in their topological space, namely &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. As an example that is dense-in-itself but not dense in its topological space, consider &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q} \cap [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;. This set is not dense in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; but is dense-in-itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14094">In [[economics]], [[geography]], [[demography]] and [[sociology]], the '''dependency ratio''' is an age-population ratio of those typically not in the [[labor force]] (the ''dependent'' part ages 0 to 14 and 65+) and those typically in the labor force (the ''productive'' part ages 15 to 64). It is used to measure the pressure on productive population.

Consideration of the dependency ratio is essential for governments, economists, bankers, business, industry, universities and all other major economic segments which can benefit from understanding the impacts of changes in the dependency ratio.  In the article,&amp;nbsp;''"Minimizing the Dependency Ratio in a Population with Below-Replacement Fertility Through Immigration"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Minimizing the dependency ratio in a population with below-replacement fertility through immigration | pmc=3458215 | pmid=22781918 | doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2012.06.009 | volume=82 | issue=3 | journal=Theor Popul Biol | pages=158–69 | last1 = Simon | first1 = C | last2 = Belyakov | first2 = AO | last3 = Feichtinger | first3 = G}}&lt;/ref&gt; having an intermediate dependency ratio informs us that there are sufficient people in the working class who can support the dependent population.  A lower ratio could allow for example for better pensions and better health care for residents.  A higher ratio would indicate more financial stress between working people and dependents.  While the strategies of increasing fertility and of allowing immigration especially of younger working age people have been formulas for lowering dependency ratios, future job reductions through automation may impact the effectivness of those strategies.

==Formula== 
In published international statistics, the dependent part usually  includes those under the age of 15 and over the age of 64.The productive part makes up the population in between, ages 15 – 64. It is normally expressed as a percentage:
:&lt;math&gt;(Total)\ Dependency \ ratio = \frac{(number\ of\ people\ aged\ 0-14\ and\ those\ aged\ 65\ and\ over)} {number\ of\ people\ aged\ 15-64} \times 100 &lt;/math&gt;

As the ratio increases there may be an increased burden on the productive part of the population to maintain the [[child|upbringing]] and [[pension]]s of the economically dependent. This results in direct impacts on financial expenditures on things like [[social security]], as well as many indirect consequences.

The (total) dependency ratio can be decomposed into the child dependency ratio and the aged dependency ratio:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apheo.ca/index.php?pid=63 Association of Public Health Epidemiologists in Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706164640/http://www.apheo.ca/index.php?pid=63 |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Child\ dependency\ ratio\ = \frac{number\ of\ people\ aged\ 0-14} {number\ of\ people\ aged\ 15-64}  \times 100 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Aged\ dependency\ ratio\ = \frac{number\ of\ people\ aged\ 65\ and\ over} {number\ of\ people\ aged\ 15-64} \times 100  &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Migration2008 /&gt;

== Total dependency ratio by region - history and projections ==
Below is a table constructed from data provided by the UN Population Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/|title=United Nations Population Division, World Population Prospects 2017, File Name: Total Dependency Ratio 1|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It shows a historical ratio for the regions shown for the period 1950 - 2010.  Columns to the right show projections of the ratio.  Each number in the table shows the total number of dependents (people aged 0-14 plus people aged over 65) per hundred people in the workforce (number of people aged 15-64).   The number can also be expressed as a percent.  So, the total dependency ratio for the world in 1950 was 64.8% of the workforce.

As of 2010, Japan and Europe had high aged dependency ratios (that is over 65 as % of workforce) compared to other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.DPND.OL/countries?display=map&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe 2010, for every adult aged 65 and older there are approximately four working age adults (15-64); This ratio (one:four, or 25%) is expected to decrease to one:two, or 50%, by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muszyńska|first=Magdalena M.|last2=Rau|first2=Roland|date=2012-09-01|title=The Old-Age Healthy Dependency Ratio in Europe|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12062-012-9068-6|journal=Journal of Population Ageing|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=151–162|doi=10.1007/s12062-012-9068-6|issn=1874-7884|pmc=3412045|pmid=22924086}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aging population is caused by a decline in fertility and longer life expectancy. The average life expectancy of males and females are expected to increase from 79 years in 1990 to 82 years in 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c8461.pdf|title=Population Aging and the Savings-Investment Balance in Japan|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dependency amongst Japan residents aged 65 and older is expected to increase which will have a major impact on Japan's economy.

== Inverse ==
The inverse of the dependency ratio, the '''inverse dependency ratio''' can be interpreted as how many independent workers have to provide for one dependent person (pension &amp; expenditure on children).

A high dependency ratio can cause serious problems for a country if a large proportion of a government's expenditure is on health, social security &amp; education, which are most used by the youngest and the oldest in a population.  The fewer people of working age, the fewer the people who can support [[school]]s, retirement [[pension]]s, [[disability pension]]s and other assistances to the youngest and oldest members of a population, often considered the most [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]] members of [[society]].

Nevertheless, the dependency ratio ignores the fact that the 65+ are not necessarily dependent (an increasing proportion of them are working) and that many of those of 'working age' are actually not working. Alternatives have been developed', such as the 'economic dependency ratio', but they still ignore factors such as increases in productivity and in working hours. Worries about increasing (demographic) dependency ratio should thus be taken with caution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/sites/default/files/ef_files/pubdocs/2012/59/en/2/EF1259EN.pdf|title=Eurofound (2012), Income from work after retirement in the EU, Publications Office of the European Union, Luxembourg.|last=Dubois and Anderson|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High dependency ratios can also lead to long-term economic changes within the population such as saving rates, investment rates, the housing markets, and the consumption patterns. Typically, workers will start to increase their savings as they grow closer to retirement age, but this will eventually affect their long-term interest rates due to the retirement population increasing and the fertility rates decreasing. If the demographic population continues to follow this trend, their savings will decrease while their long-term interest rates increase. Due to the saving rates decreasing, the investment rate will prevent economic growth because there will be less funding for investment projects. There is a correlation between labor force and housing markets, so when there is a high age-dependency ratio in a country, the investments in housing markets will decrease since the labor force is decreasing due to a high dependency population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2016/09/02/long-run-economic-effects-of-changes-in-the-age-dependency-ratio/|title=Long-Run Economic Effects of Changes in the Age Dependency Ratio|last1=Santacreu|first1=Maria|date=|website=Economic Research - Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=September 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migrant labor dependency ratio==
Migrant labor dependency ratio (MLDR) is used to describe the extent to which the domestic population is dependent upon migrant labor.&lt;ref name="Migration2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=International Organization for Migration|title=World Migration 2008: Managing Labour Mobility in the Evolving Global Economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UllpLB1hwdIC&amp;pg=PA440|accessdate=21 August 2012|year=2008|publisher=Hammersmith Press|isbn=978-92-9068-405-3|pages=440–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://rspas.anu.edu.au/~athu/Journal%20Papers/International%20labou%2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solutions ==
Low dependency ratios promote economic growth while high dependency ratios decrease economic growth due to the large amounts of dependents that pay little to no taxes. A solution to decreasing the dependency ratio within a country is to promote immigration for younger people. This will stimulate a higher economic growth because the working-age population will grow in numbers if more young adults migrate into their country. This method has shown great results in Asia's economic growth.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://andrewlainton.wordpress.com/2011/05/29/dependency-ratio-and-immigration/|title=Dependency ratio and Immigration/emigration|date=2011-05-29|work=Decisions, Decisions, Decisions|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in the involvement of women in the work force has contributed to the working-age population which compliments the dependency ratio for a country. Encouraging women to work will help decrease the dependency ratio. Because more women are getting a higher education, it is less likely for them to have children causing the fertility rates to decrease as well. 

== Dependency ratios based on the Demographic Transition Model ==
The age-dependency ratio can determine which stage in the [[Demographic transition|Demographic Transition Model]] a certain country is in. The dependency ratio acts like a rollercoaster when going through the stages of the Demographic Transition Model. During stages 1 and 2, the dependency ratio is high due to significantly high [[Birth rate|crude birth rates]] putting pressure onto the smaller working-age population to take care of all of them. In stage 3, the dependency ratio starts to decrease because fertility and mortality rates start to decrease which shows that the proportion of adults to the young and elderly are much larger in this stage. In stages 4 and 5, the dependency ratio starts to increase once again as the working-age population retires. Because [[Total fertility rate|fertility rates]] caused the younger population to decrease, once they grow up and start working, there will be more pressure for them to take care of the previous working-age population that just retired since there will be more young and elderly people than working-age adults during that time period.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://snappington.com/aphg/units/population/population-geography/demographic-transition-model.html|title=Demographic Transition Model|last=User|first=Super|website=snappington.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population structure of a country is an important factor for determining the economic status of their country. Japan is a great example of an aging population. They have a 1:4 ratio of people 65 years and older. This causes trouble for them because there is not enough people in the working-age population to support all of the elders. Rwanda is another example of a population that struggles with a younger population (also known as the "[[Population pyramid|youth bulge]]"). Both of these countries are struggling with high dependency ratios even though both countries are on opposite stages of the Demographic Transition Model.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/dependency-ratio/|title=Dependency Ratio - Economics  Help|work=Economics  Help|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3917">[[Image:Incircles.JPG|thumb|360px|If the blue circles are equal, the green circles are also equal.]]
In [[geometry]], the '''equal incircles theorem''' derives from a Japanese [[Sangaku]], and pertains to the following construction: a series of rays are drawn from a given point to a given line such that the inscribed circles of the triangles formed by adjacent rays and the base line are equal. In the illustration the equal blue circles define the spacing between the rays, as described.

The theorem states that the incircles of the triangles formed (starting from any given ray) by every other ray, every third ray, etc. and the base line are also equal.  The case of every other ray is illustrated above by the green circles, which are all equal.

From the fact that the theorem doesn't depend on the angle of the initial ray, it can be seen that the theorem properly belongs to analysis, rather than geometry, and must relate to a continuous scaling function which defines the spacing of the rays. In fact, this function is the [[Hyperbolic function|hyperbolic sine]].

The theorem is a direct corollary of the following lemma:

Suppose that the nth ray makes an angle &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,_n&lt;/math&gt; with the normal to the baseline. If &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,_n&lt;/math&gt; is parameterized according to the equation, &lt;math&gt;\tan \gamma\,_n = \sinh\theta\,_n&lt;/math&gt;, then values of &lt;math&gt;\theta\,_n = a + nb&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\!a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\!b&lt;/math&gt; are real constants, define a sequence of rays that satisfy the condition of equal incircles, and furthermore any sequence of rays satisfying the condition can be produced by suitable choice of the constants &lt;math&gt;\!a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\!b&lt;/math&gt;. {{-}}

== Proof of the lemma ==
[[Image:equal incircles theorem.svg|600px|center]]
In the diagram, lines PS and PT are adjacent rays making angles &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma\,_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; with line PR, which is perpendicular to the baseline, RST.

Line QXOY is parallel to the baseline and passes through O, the center of the incircle of &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; PST, which is tangent to the rays at W and Z. Also, line PQ has length &lt;math&gt;\!h-r&lt;/math&gt;, and line QR has length &lt;math&gt;\!r&lt;/math&gt;, the radius of the incircle.

Then &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; OWX is similar to &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; PQX and &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; OZY is similar to &lt;math&gt;\triangle&lt;/math&gt; PQY, and from XY = XO + OY we get

: &lt;math&gt;(h-r) ( \tan \gamma\,_{n+1} - \tan \gamma\,_n ) = r ( \sec \gamma\,_n + \sec \gamma\,_{n+1} ).&lt;/math&gt;

This relation on a set of angles, &lt;math&gt;\{ \gamma\,_m \}&lt;/math&gt;, expresses the condition of equal incircles.

To prove the lemma, we set &lt;math&gt; \tan \gamma\,_n = \sinh (a+nb)&lt;/math&gt;, which gives &lt;math&gt; \sec \gamma\,_n = \cosh\, (a+nb)&lt;/math&gt;.

Using  &lt;math&gt;\!a+(n+1)b = (a+nb)+b&lt;/math&gt;, we apply the addition rules for &lt;math&gt;\!\sinh&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\!\cosh&lt;/math&gt;, and verify that the equal incircles relation is satisfied by setting

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {r}{h-r} = \tanh\frac{b}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

This gives an expression for the parameter &lt;math&gt;\!b&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the geometric measures, &lt;math&gt;\!h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\!r&lt;/math&gt;. With this definition of &lt;math&gt;\!b&lt;/math&gt; we then obtain an expression for the radii, &lt;math&gt;\!r_N&lt;/math&gt;, of the incircles formed by taking every ''N''th ray as the sides of the triangles

: &lt;math&gt;\frac {r_N}{h-r_N} = \tanh\frac{Nb}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19588">In [[mathematics]], a sequence {''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...} of [[real number]]s is said to be '''equidistributed''', or '''uniformly distributed''', if the proportion of terms falling in a subinterval is proportional to the length of that interval.  Such sequences are studied in [[Diophantine approximation]] theory and have applications to [[Monte Carlo integration]].

==Definition==
A sequence {''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...} of [[real number]]s is said to be ''equidistributed'' on a non-degenerate [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] if for any subinterval [''c'',&amp;nbsp;''d''] of [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] we have
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}{ \left|\{\,s_1,\dots,s_n \,\} \cap [c,d] \right| \over n}={d-c \over b-a} . &lt;/math&gt;
(Here, the notation |{''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;}∩[''c'',''d'']| denotes the number of elements, out of the first ''n'' elements of the sequence, that are between ''c'' and ''d''.)

For example, if a sequence is equidistributed in [0,&amp;nbsp;2], since the interval [0.5,&amp;nbsp;0.9] occupies 1/5 of the length of the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;2], as ''n'' becomes large, the proportion of the first ''n'' members of the sequence which fall between 0.5 and 0.9 must approach 1/5.  Loosely speaking, one could say that each member of the sequence is equally likely to fall anywhere in its range.  However, this is not to say that {''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} is a sequence of random variables; rather, it is a determinate sequence of real numbers.

===Discrepancy===
We define the '''discrepancy''' ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; for a sequence {''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...} with respect to the interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] as

:&lt;math&gt; D_N = \sup_{a\le c\le d\le b} \left\vert \frac{\left|\{\,s_1,\dots,s_N \,\} \cap [c,d] \right|}{N} - \frac{d-c}{b-a} \right\vert . &lt;/math&gt;

A sequence is thus equidistributed if the discrepancy ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; tends to zero as ''N'' tends to infinity.

Equidistribution is a rather weak criterion to express the fact that a sequence fills the segment leaving no gaps. For example, the drawings of a random variable uniform over a segment will be equidistributed in the segment, but there will be large gaps compared to a sequence which first enumerates multiples of ε in the segment, for some small ε, in an appropriately chosen way, and then continues to do this for smaller and smaller values of ε. For stronger criteria and for constructions of sequences that are more evenly distributed, see [[low-discrepancy sequence]].

===Riemann integral criterion for equidistribution===
Recall that if ''f'' is a function having a [[Riemann integral]] in the interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''], then its integral is the limit of [[Riemann sum]]s taken by sampling the function ''f'' in a set of points chosen from a fine partition of the interval. Therefore, if some sequence is equidistributed in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''], it is expected that this sequence can be used to calculate the integral of a Riemann-integrable function. This leads to the following criterion&lt;ref&gt;Kuipers &amp; Niederreiter (2006) pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt; for an equidistributed sequence:

Suppose {''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...} is a sequence contained in the interval [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
# The sequence is equidistributed on [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''].
# For every Riemann-integrable ([[Complex-valued function|complex-valued]]) function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'']&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;ℂ, the following limit holds:

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^{N} f\left(s_n\right) = \frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="90%" style="text-align:left"
!Proof
|-
|First note that the definition of an equidistributed sequence is equivalent to the integral criterion whenever ''f'' is the [[indicator function]] of an interval: If ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''1'''&lt;sub&gt;[''c'',&amp;nbsp;''d'']&lt;/sub&gt;, then the left hand side is the proportion of points of the sequence falling in the interval [''c'',&amp;nbsp;''d''], and the right hand side is exactly &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{d-c}{b-a}.&lt;/math&gt;

This means 2 → 1 (since indicator functions are Riemann-integrable), and 1 → 2 for ''f'' being an indicator function of an interval. It remains to assume that the integral criterion holds for indicator functions and prove that it holds for general Riemann-integrable functions as well.

Note that both sides of the integral criterion equation are ''linear'' in ''f'', and therefore the criterion holds for [[linear combination]]s of interval indicators, that is, [[step function]]s.

To show it holds for ''f'' being a general Riemann-integrable function, first assume ''f'' is real-valued. Then by using [[Darboux integral|Darboux's definition]] of the integral, we have for every ε&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 two step functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; such that ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''f''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\int_a^b (f_2(x) - f_1(x))\,dx \le \varepsilon(b-a).&lt;/math&gt; Notice that:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f_1(x)\,dx = \lim_{N\to\infty} \frac 1 N \sum_{n=1}^N f_1(s_n) \le \liminf_{N\to\infty} \frac 1 N \sum_{n=1}^N f(s_n)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f_2(x)\,dx = \lim_{N\to\infty} \frac 1 N \sum_{n=1}^N f_2(s_n) \ge \limsup_{N\to\infty} \frac 1 N \sum_{n=1}^N f(s_n)&lt;/math&gt;
By subtracting, we see that the [[limit superior and limit inferior]] of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac 1 N \sum_{n=1}^N f(s_n)&lt;/math&gt; differ by at most ε. Since ε is arbitrary, we have the existence of the limit, and by Darboux's definition of the integral, it is the correct limit.

Finally, for complex-valued Riemann-integrable functions, the result follows again from linearity, and from the fact that every such function can be written as ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''u''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''vi'', where ''u'', ''v'' are real-valued and Riemann-integrable.&amp;nbsp;[[Q.E.D.|∎]]
|}
This criterion leads to the idea of [[Monte-Carlo integration]], where integrals are computed by sampling the function over a sequence of random variables equidistributed in the interval.

It is not possible to generalize the integral criterion to a class of functions bigger than just the Riemann-integrable ones. For example, if the [[Lebesgue integral]] is considered and ''f'' is taken to be in [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]], then this criterion fails. As a counterexample, take ''f'' to be the [[indicator function]] of some equidistributed sequence. Then in the criterion, the left hand side is always 1, whereas the right hand side is zero, because the sequence is countable, so ''f'' is zero [[almost everywhere]].

In fact, the '''de Bruijn–Post Theorem''' states the converse of the above criterion: If ''f'' is a function such that the criterion above holds for any equidistributed sequence in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''], then ''f'' is Riemann-integrable in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''].&lt;ref&gt;http://math.uga.edu/~pete/udnotes.pdf, Theorem 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equidistribution modulo 1==
A sequence {''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...} of real numbers is said to be '''equidistributed modulo 1''' or '''uniformly distributed modulo 1''' if the sequence of the [[fractional part]]s of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, denoted by {''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} or by ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;⌊''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;⌋, is equidistributed in the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

===Examples===

* More generally, if ''p'' is a polynomial with at least one coefficient other than the constant term irrational then the sequence ''p''(''n'') is uniformly distributed modulo 1.

===Weyl's criterion===
'''Weyl's criterion''' states that the sequence ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is equidistributed modulo 1 if and only if for all non-zero integers ℓ,
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}e^{2\pi i \ell a_j}=0.&lt;/math&gt;
The criterion is named after, and was first formulated by, [[Hermann Weyl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weyl|first=H.|authorlink=Hermann Weyl|title=Über die Gleichverteilung von Zahlen mod. Eins |language=de |trans-title=On the distribution of numbers modulo one |journal=Math.

!Sketch of proof
|-
|If the sequence is equidistributed modulo 1, then we can apply the Riemann integral criterion (described above) on the function &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f(x) = e^{2\pi i \ell x},&lt;/math&gt; which has integral zero on the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This gives Weyl's criterion immediately.

Conversely, suppose Weyl's criterion holds. Then the Riemann integral criterion holds for functions ''f'' as above, and by linearity of the criterion, it holds for ''f'' being any [[trigonometric polynomial]]. By the [[Stone–Weierstrass theorem]] and an approximation argument, this extends to any ''continuous'' function ''f''.

Finally, let ''f'' be the [[indicator function]] of an interval. It is possible to bound ''f'' from above and below by two continuous functions on the interval, whose integrals differ by an arbitrary ε. By an argument similar to the proof of the Riemann integral criterion, it is possible to extend the result to any ''interval indicator'' function ''f'', thereby proving equidistribution modulo 1 of the given sequence.&amp;nbsp;[[Q.E.D.|∎]]

====Generalizations====
* A quantitative form of Weyl's criterion is given by the [[Erdős–Turán inequality]].
* Weyl's criterion extends naturally to higher [[dimension]]s, assuming the natural generalization of the definition of equidistribution modulo 1:

The sequence ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; is equidistributed modulo 1 if and only if for any non-zero vector ℓ&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;'''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}e^{2\pi i \ell \cdot v_j}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

====Example of usage====
Weyl's criterion can be used to easily prove the [[equidistribution theorem]], stating that the sequence of multiples 0, ''α'', 2''α'', 3''α'', ... of some real number ''α'' is equidistributed modulo 1 if and only if ''α'' is irrational.&lt;ref name=KN8/&gt;

Suppose ''α'' is irrational and denote our sequence by ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''jα'' (where ''j'' starts from 0, to simplify the formula later). Let ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0 be an integer. Since ''α'' is irrational, ''ℓα'' can never be an integer, so &lt;math display=inline&gt;e^{2\pi i \ell \alpha}&lt;/math&gt; can never be&amp;nbsp;1. Using the formula for the sum of a finite [[geometric series]],
:&lt;math&gt;\left|\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}e^{2\pi i \ell j \alpha}\right| = \left|\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\left(e^{2\pi i \ell \alpha}\right)^j\right| = \left| \frac{1 - e^{2\pi i \ell n \alpha}} {1 - e^{2\pi i \ell \alpha}}\right| \le \frac 2 { \left|1 - e^{2\pi i \ell \alpha}\right|},&lt;/math&gt;
a finite bound that does not depend on ''n''. Therefore after dividing by ''n'' and letting ''n'' tend to infinity, the left hand side tends to zero, and Weyl's criterion is satisfied.

Conversely, notice that if ''α'' is rational then this sequence is not equidistributed modulo 1, because there are only a finite number of options for the fractional part of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''jα''.

===van der Corput's difference theorem===

A '''van der Corput set''' is a set ''H'' of integers such that if for each ''h'' in ''H'' the sequence ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+''h''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is uniformly distributed modulo 1, then so is s&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=Mon18/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mon2001/&gt;

===Metric theorems===
Metric theorems describe the behaviour of a parametrised sequence for [[almost all]] values of some parameter ''α'': that is, for values of ''α'' not lying in some exceptional set of [[Lebesgue measure]] zero.

* For any sequence of distinct integers ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the sequence {{mset|''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''α''}} is equidistributed mod 1 for almost all values of ''α''.&lt;ref&gt;See {{citation | title=Über eine Anwendung der Mengenlehre auf ein aus der Theorie der säkularen Störungen herrührendes Problem | first=Felix | last=Bernstein | authorlink=Felix Bernstein (mathematician) | journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] | volume=71 | number=3 | year=1911 | pages=417–439 | doi=10.1007/BF01456856 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known whether the sequences {{mset|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} or {{mset|{{pi}}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are equidistributed mod&amp;nbsp;1.  However it is known that the sequence {{mset|''α''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is ''not'' equidistributed mod&amp;nbsp;1 if ''α'' is a [[PV number]].

==Well-distributed sequence==
A sequence {''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...} of [[real number]]s is said to be '''well-distributed''' on [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] if for any subinterval [''c'',&amp;nbsp;''d''] of [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] we have
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}{ \left|\{\,s_{k+1},\dots,s_{k+n} \,\} \cap [c,d] \right| \over n}={d-c \over b-a} &lt;/math&gt;
''uniformly'' in ''k''.  Clearly every well-distributed sequence is uniformly distributed, but the converse does not hold.  The definition of well-distributed modulo 1 is analogous.

==Sequences equidistributed with respect to an arbitrary measure==
For an arbitrary [[probability measure space]] &lt;math&gt;(X,\mu)&lt;/math&gt;, a sequence of points &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; is said to be equidistributed with respect to &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; if the mean of [[Dirac delta function|point measures]] [[Convergence of measures#Weak convergence of measures|converges weakly]] to &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref name=KN171&gt;Kuipers &amp; Niederreiter (2006) p.171&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sum_{k=1}^n \delta_{x_k}}{n}\Rightarrow \mu \ . &lt;/math&gt;
It is true, for example, that for any [[Borel measure|Borel]] [[probability measure]] on a [[separable space|separable]], [[metrizable]] space, there exists an equidistributed sequence (with respect to the measure).{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1759">In mathematics, and especially [[general topology]], the '''Euclidean topology''' is the [[natural topology]] induced on [[Euclidean space|Euclidean n-space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; by the [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean metric]].

In any [[metric space]], the [[Ball_(mathematics)|open balls]] form a [[Base (topology)|base]] for a topology on that space.&lt;ref&gt;[[Metric space|Metric space#Open and closed sets.2C topology and convergence]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Euclidean topology on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; is then simply the topology ''generated'' by these balls. In other words, the open sets of the Euclidean topology on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; are given by (arbitrary) unions of the open balls &lt;math&gt;B_{r}(p)&lt;/math&gt; defined as &lt;math&gt;B_{r}(p) := \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid d(p,x) &lt; r \}&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;p \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the Euclidean metric.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1817">"A population is said to be in an '''evolutionarily stable state''' if its genetic composition is restored by selection after a disturbance, provided the disturbance is not too large. Such a population can be genetically [[Monomorphism (biology)|monomorphic]] or polymorphic." —Maynard Smith (1982).

Contrast this with the definition of an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]], which is a [[game theory]] concept.

"An ESS or evolutionarily stable strategy is a strategy such that, if all the members of a population adopt it, no mutant strategy can invade." —Maynard Smith (1982).

== Mathematical formulation ==

Evolutionarily stable states are frequently used to identify solutions to the [[replicator equation]], given in its linear payoff form by
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x_i}=x_i\left(\left(Ax\right)_i-x^TAx\right),&lt;/math&gt;
The state &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''evolutionarily stable''' if for all &lt;math&gt;x \neq \hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; in some neighborhood of &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x^TAx &lt; \hat{x}^TAx&lt;/math&gt;

This is similar but distinct from the concept of an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]].

== Properties ==

It can be shown that for the replicator equation if a state is evolutionarily stable then it is an asymptotically stable rest point, so the evolutionarily stable states are often taken as solutions of the replicator equation. The converse is true if the game matrix is symmetric.

The concept of evolutionary stability is equivalent to the concept of [[strong stability]] for [[normal form game]]s, due to Cressman.

In [[mathematics]], the '''exterior covariant derivative''' is an analog of an [[exterior derivative]] that takes into account the presence of a [[Connection (principal bundle)|connection]].

==Definition==
Let ''G'' be a Lie group and {{nowrap|''P'' → ''M''}} be a [[principal bundle|principal ''G''-bundle]] on a [[smooth manifold]] ''M''. Suppose there is a [[connection (principal bundle)|connection]] on ''P''; this yields a natural direct sum decomposition &lt;math&gt;T_u P = H_u \oplus V_u&lt;/math&gt; of each tangent space into the [[horizontal subspace|horizontal]] and [[vertical subspace|vertical]] subspaces. Let &lt;math&gt;h: T_u P \to H_u&lt;/math&gt; be the projection to the horizontal subspace.

If ''ϕ'' is a [[vector-valued form|''k''-form]] on ''P'' with values in a vector space ''V'', then its exterior covariant derivative ''Dϕ'' is a form defined by
:&lt;math&gt;D\phi(v_0, v_1,\dots, v_k)= d \phi(h v_0 ,h v_1,\dots, h v_k)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are tangent vectors to ''P'' at ''u''.

Suppose that {{nowrap|''ρ'' : ''G'' → GL(''V'')}} is a [[representation of a Lie group|representation]] of ''G'' on a vector space ''V''. If ''ϕ'' is [[equivariant]] in the sense that

:&lt;math&gt;R_g^* \phi = \rho(g)^{-1}\phi&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_g(u) = ug&lt;/math&gt;, then ''Dϕ'' is a [[tensorial form|tensorial {{nowrap|(''k'' + 1)}}-form]] on ''P'' of the type ''ρ'': it is equivariant and horizontal (a form ''ψ'' is horizontal if {{nowrap|1=''ψ''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''ψ''(''hv''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''hv''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.)

By [[abuse of notation]], the differential of ρ at the identity element may again be denoted by ρ:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho: \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{gl}(V).&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; be the [[connection one-form]] and &lt;math&gt;\rho(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; the representation of the connection in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}(V).&lt;/math&gt; That is, &lt;math&gt;\rho(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Lie algebra-valued differential form#operations|&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}(V)&lt;/math&gt;-valued form]], vanishing on the horizontal subspace. If ''ϕ'' is a tensorial ''k''-form of type ''ρ'', then
:&lt;math&gt;D \phi = d \phi + \rho(\omega) \cdot \phi,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;If {{nowrap|1=''k'' = 0}}, then, writing &lt;math&gt;X^{\#}&lt;/math&gt; for the [[fundamental vector field]] (i.e., vertical vector field) generated by ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; on ''P'', we have:
:&lt;math&gt;d \phi(X^{\#}_u) = \left . {d \over dt}\right\vert_0 \phi(u \operatorname{exp}(tX)) = -\rho(X)\phi(u) = -\rho(\omega(X^{\#}_u))\phi(u)&lt;/math&gt;,
since {{nowrap|1=''ϕ''(''gu'') = ''ρ''(''g''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;)''ϕ''(''u'')}}. On the other hand, {{nowrap|1=''Dϕ''(''X''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;) = 0}}. If ''X'' is a horizontal tangent vector, then &lt;math&gt;D \phi(X) = d\phi(X)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega(X) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. For the general case, let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s be tangent vectors to ''P'' at some point such that some of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s are horizontal and the rest vertical. If ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is vertical, we think of it as a Lie algebra element and then identify it with the fundamental vector field generated by it. If ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is horizontal, we replace it with the [[horizontal lift]] of the vector field extending the pushforward π''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. This way, we have extended ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s to vector fields. Note the extension is such that we have: [''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;] = 0 if ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is horizontal and ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is vertical. Finally, by the [[invariant formula for exterior derivative]], we have:
:&lt;math&gt;D \phi(X_0, \dots, X_k) - d \phi(X_0, \dots, X_k) = {1 \over k+1} \sum_0^k (-1)^i \rho(\omega(X_i)) \phi(X_0, \dots, \widehat{X_i}, \dots, X_k)&lt;/math&gt;,
which is &lt;math&gt;(\rho(\omega) \cdot \phi)(X_0, \cdots, X_k)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

where, following the notation in {{section link|Lie algebra-valued differential form|Operations}}, we wrote

:&lt;math&gt;(\rho(\omega) \cdot \phi)(v_1, \dots, v_{k+1}) = {1 \over (1+k)!} \sum_{\sigma}  \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)\rho(\omega(v_{\sigma(1)})) \phi(v_{\sigma(2)}, \dots, v_{\sigma(k+1)}).&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!--
If one chooses a basis ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, then the formula reads:
:&lt;math&gt;(D \phi)^k = d \phi^k + \rho_{ij}^k \omega^i \wedge \phi^j&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\phi = \sum \phi^i e_i&lt;/math&gt;, the same for ''ω'' and ''Dϕ'' and &lt;math&gt;\rho(e_i)e_j = \sum \rho_{ij}^k e_k&lt;/math&gt;.
--&gt;
Unlike the usual [[exterior derivative]], which squares to 0, the exterior covariant derivative does not. In general, one has, for a tensorial zero-form ''ϕ'',

:&lt;math&gt;D^2\phi=F \cdot \phi.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proof: Since ''ρ'' acts on the constant part of ''ω'', it commutes with ''d'' and thus
:&lt;math&gt;d(\rho(\omega) \cdot \phi) = d(\rho(\omega)) \cdot \phi - \rho(\omega) \cdot d\phi = \rho(d \omega) \cdot \phi - \rho(\omega) \cdot d\phi&lt;/math&gt;.
Then, according to the example at {{section link|Lie algebra-valued differential form|Operations}},
:&lt;math&gt;D^2 \phi = \rho(d \omega) \cdot \phi + \rho(\omega) \cdot (\rho(\omega) \cdot \phi) = \rho(d \omega) \cdot \phi + {1 \over 2} \rho([\omega \wedge \omega]) \cdot \phi,&lt;/math&gt;
which is &lt;math&gt;\rho(\Omega) \cdot \phi&lt;/math&gt; by [[E. Cartan's structure equation]].&lt;/ref&gt;

where {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''ρ''(Ω)}} is the representation in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{gl}(V)&lt;/math&gt; of the [[curvature form|curvature two-form]] Ω.  The form F is sometimes referred to as the [[field strength tensor]], in analogy to the role it plays in [[electromagnetism]]. Note that ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; vanishes for a [[flat connection]] (i.e. when {{nowrap|1=Ω = 0}}).

If {{nowrap|''ρ'' : ''G'' → GL('''''R'''''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, then one can write
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(\Omega) = F = \sum {F^i}_j {e^j}_i&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;{e^i}_j&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix with 1 at the {{nowrap|(''i'', ''j'')}}-th entry and zero on the other entries. The matrix &lt;math&gt;{F^i}_j&lt;/math&gt; whose entries are 2-forms on ''P'' is called the '''curvature matrix'''.

== Exterior covariant derivative for vector bundles ==
When {{nowrap|''ρ'' : ''G'' → GL(''V'')}} is a [[representation of a Lie group|representation]], one can form the [[associated bundle]] {{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''P'' ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''ρ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''V''}}. Then the exterior covariant derivative ''D'' given by a connection on ''P'' induces an exterior covariant derivative (sometimes called the [[Connection form#Exterior connections|exterior connection]]) on the associated bundle, this time using the [[nabla symbol]]: 
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla: \Gamma(M, E) \to \Gamma(M, T^*M \otimes E)&lt;/math&gt;
Here, Γ denotes the [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] of [[section (fibre bundle)|local sections]] of the vector bundle. The extension is made through the correspondence between ''E''-valued forms and tensorial forms of type ''ρ'' (see [[Vector-valued differential forms#Basic or tensorial forms on principal bundles|tensorial forms on principal bundles]].)

Requiring ∇ to satisfy Leibniz's rule, ∇ also acts on any ''E''-valued form; thus, it is given on decomposable elements of the space &lt;math&gt;\Omega^k(M;E) = \Gamma(\Lambda^k(T^*M) \otimes E)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;-valued ''k''-forms by 
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla(\omega \otimes s) = (d \omega) \otimes s + (-1)^k \omega \wedge \nabla s \in \Omega^{k+1}(M;E)&lt;/math&gt;.

For a [[Section (fiber bundle)|section]] ''s'' of ''E'', we also set
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_X s = i_X \nabla s&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;i_X&lt;/math&gt; is the contraction by ''X''.&lt;!-- confusing? Explicitly,
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_X s = (hX) s&lt;/math&gt;
since &lt;math&gt;\nabla_X \overline{\phi} = \overline{D \phi (X)} = \overline{d \phi (hX)} = (hX)s&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;s = \overline{\phi}&lt;/math&gt;.--&gt;

Conversely, given a vector bundle ''E'', one can take its [[frame bundle]], which is a principal bundle, and so obtain an exterior covariant differentiation on ''E'' (depending on a connection). Identifying tensorial forms and ''E''-valued forms, one may show that
:&lt;math&gt;-2F(X, Y) s = \left([\nabla_X, \nabla_Y] - \nabla_{[X, Y]}\right) s&lt;/math&gt;

which can be easily recognized as the definition of the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] on [[Riemannian manifold]]s.

== Examples ==
* If ''ω'' is the connection form on ''P'', then {{nowrap|1=Ω = ''Dω''}} is called the [[curvature form]] of ''ω''.
* [[Bianchi's second identity]], which says that the exterior covariant derivative of Ω is zero (that is, {{nowrap|1=''D''Ω = 0}}) can be stated as: &lt;math&gt;d\Omega + \operatorname{ad}(\omega) \cdot \Omega = d\Omega + [\omega \wedge \Omega] = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16939">A '''fundamental ephemeris''' of the [[Solar System]] is a [[Computer simulation|model]] of the objects of the system in space, with all of their positions and motions accurately represented. It is intended to be a high-precision primary reference for prediction and observation of those positions and motions, and which provides a basis for further refinement of the model. It is generally not intended to cover the entire life of the Solar System; usually a short-duration time span, perhaps a few centuries, is represented to high accuracy. Some long ephemerides cover several millennia to medium accuracy.

They are published by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris|Development Ephemeris]]. The latest releases include DE430 which covers planetary and lunar ephemeris from Dec 21, 1549 to Jan 25, 2650 with high precision and is intended for general use for modern time periods . DE431 was created to cover a longer time period Aug 15, -13200 to March 15, 17191 with slightly less precision for use with historic observations and far reaching forecasted positions.  DE432 was released as a minor update to DE430 with improvements to the Pluto barycenter in support of the [[New Horizons]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/de432.pdf|title=JPL Memo IOM 392R-14-003|last=Folkner|first=|date=April 30, 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The set of physical laws and numerical constants used in the calculation of the ephemeris must be self-consistent and precisely specified. The ephemeris must be calculated strictly in accordance with this set, which represents the most current knowledge of all relevant physical forces and effects. Current fundamental ephemerides are typically released with exact descriptions of all mathematical models, methods of computation, observational data, and adjustment to the observations at the time of their announcement.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, {{cite web|url=http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/de405iom/de405iom.pdf |title=JPL Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides DE405/LE405 |author=Standish |date=1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220062549/http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/de405iom/de405iom.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-20 |df= }}; {{cite web|url=http://www.imcce.fr/inpop/inpop10a.pdf |title=INPOP10a |author=Fienga |display-authors=etal |date=2010 }}; {{cite web|url=http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/EPM2004.pdf |title=High-Precision Ephemerides of Planets—EPM and Determination of Some Astronomical Constants |author=Pitjeva |date=2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031065523/http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/EPM2004.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may not have been the case in the past, as fundamental ephemerides were then computed from a collection of methods derived over a span of decades by many researchers.&lt;ref name="sandw"&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ioms/ExplSupplChap8.pdf |author=Standish and Williams |title=CHAPTER 8: Orbital Ephemerides of the Sun, Moon, and Planets |date=2010}} A chapter from an as-yet-unpublished (Feb 2012) version of the ''Explanatory Supplement'' (see [[#Sources|Sources]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The independent variable of the ephemeris is always time. In the case of the most current ephemerides, it is a [[Coordinate time|relativistic coordinate time]] scale equivalent to the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] definition of [[Barycentric Coordinate Time|TCB]].&lt;ref name="sandw" /&gt; In the past, [[Solar time|mean solar time]] (before the discovery of the non-uniform [[rotation of the Earth]]) and [[ephemeris time]] (before the implementation of [[Post-Newtonian expansion|relativistic gravitational equations]]) were used. The remainder of the ephemeris can consist of either the mathematical equations and initial conditions which describe the motions of the bodies of the Solar System, of tabulated data calculated from those equations and conditions, or of condensed mathematical representations of the tabulated data.

A fundamental ephemeris is the basis from which apparent ephemerides, phenomena, and orbital elements are computed for astronomical, nautical, and surveyors' almanacs. Apparent ephemerides give positions and motions of Solar System bodies as seen by observers from the surface of Earth, and are useful for astronomers, navigators, and surveyors in planning observations and in reducing the data acquired, although much of the work of latter two has been supplanted by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] technology. Phenomena are events related to the configurations of Solar System bodies, for instance [[Sunrise|rise]] and [[Sunset|set]] times, [[Lunar phase|phases]], [[eclipse]]s and [[occultation]]s, and have many civil and scientific applications. [[Orbital elements]] are descriptions of the motion of a body at a particular instant, used for further short-time-span calculation of the body's position when high accuracy is not required.

==History==
Astronomers have been tasked with computing accurate ephemerides, originally for purposes of sea navigation, from at least the 18th century. In England, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] founded the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] in 1675,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/royal-observatory/history/ |title=History of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich}}&lt;/ref&gt; which began publishing ''[[The Nautical Almanac]]'' in 1766.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/na_history.php |title=History of The Nautical Almanac}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the ''[[Bureau des Longitudes]]'' was founded in 1795 to publish the ''[[Connaissance des Temps]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imcce.fr/en/presentation/histoire_imcce.php |title=History of the IMCCE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early fundamental ephemerides of these publications came from many different sources and authors as the science of [[celestial mechanics]] matured.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Explanatory Supplement'' (1961), chap. 7 or ''Explanatory Supplement'' (1992), chap. 13 for extensive lists of sources of the early fundamental ephemerides of the ''Nautical Almanac''. (see [[#Sources|Sources]])&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the 19th century, the analytical methods of [[Perturbation (astronomy)|general perturbations]] reached the probable limits of what could be accomplished by hand calculation.

From the mid 20th century, work began on [[numerical integration]] of the [[equations of motion]] on [[IBM SSEC|early computing machines]] for purposes of producing fundamental ephemerides for the ''Astronomical Almanac''. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto were based on the work of Eckert, ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Eckert |author2=Brouwer |author3=Clemence |date=1951 |title=Coordinates of the Five Outer Planets 1953–2060 |series=Astronom.

Papers American Ephem. |volume=XIII |issue=Part V}}&lt;/ref&gt; through 1983. The fundamental ephemeris of the Moon, always a difficult problem in celestial mechanics, remained a work-in-progress through the early 1980s. It was based originally on the work of Brown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nBFLAAAAYAAJ |author=Brown |date=1919 |title=Tables of the Motion of the Moon |publisher=Yale University Press, New Haven, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt; with updates and corrections by Clemence, ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1952 |title=Aberration in the Lunar Ephemeris |journal=Astronomical Journal |volume=57 |pages=46–47|bibcode=1952AJ.....57...46C |doi=10.1086/106703 |last1=Clemence |first1=G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6162">Generalized Context-free Grammar (GCFG) is a grammar formalism that expands on context-free grammars by adding potentially non-context free composition functions to rewrite rules.&lt;ref name="weir1988"&gt;{{cite thesis| type=Ph.D.| author=Weir, David Jeremy| title=Characterizing mildly context-sensitive grammar formalisms| date=Sep 1988| volume=AAI8908403| publisher=University of Pennsylvania Ann Arbor| series=Paper| url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/davidw/resources/papers/dissertation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Head grammar]] (and its weak equivalents) is an instance of such a GCFG which is known to be especially adept at handling a wide variety of non-CF properties of natural language.

==Description==

A GCFG consists of two components: a set of composition functions that combine string tuples, and a set of rewrite rules. The composition functions all have the form &lt;math&gt;f(\langle x_1, ..., x_m \rangle, \langle y_1, ..., y_n \rangle, ...) = \gamma&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is either a single string tuple, or some use of a (potentially different) composition function which reduces to a string tuple. Rewrite rules look like &lt;math&gt;X \to f(Y, Z, ...)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, ... are string tuples or non-terminal symbols.

The rewrite semantics of GCFGs is fairly straightforward. An occurrence of a non-terminal symbol is rewritten using rewrite rules as in a context-free grammar, eventually yielding just compositions (composition functions applied to string tuples or other compositions). The composition functions are then applied, successively reducing the tuples to a single tuple.

==Example==

A simple translation of a context-free grammar into a GCFG can be performed in the following fashion. Given the grammar in ({{EquationNote|1}}), which generates the palindrome language &lt;math&gt;\{ ww^R : w \in \{a, b\}^{*} \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;w^R&lt;/math&gt; is the string reverse of &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, we can define the composition function ''conc'' as in ({{EquationNote|2a}}) and the rewrite rules as in ({{EquationNote|2b}}).

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;S \to \epsilon ~|~ aSa ~|~ bSb&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;conc(\langle x \rangle, \langle y \rangle, \langle z \rangle) = \langle xyz \rangle&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2a}}}}
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; S \to conc(\langle \epsilon \rangle, \langle \epsilon \rangle, \langle \epsilon \rangle) ~|~ conc(\langle a \rangle, S, \langle a \rangle) ~|~ conc(\langle b \rangle, S, \langle b \rangle)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2b}}}}

The CF production of ''abbbba'' is

: S

: aSa

: abSba

: abbSbba

: abbbba

and the corresponding GCFG production is

: &lt;math&gt;S \to conc(\langle a \rangle, S, \langle a \rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;conc(\langle a \rangle, conc(\langle b \rangle, S, \langle b \rangle), \langle a \rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;conc(\langle a \rangle, conc(\langle b \rangle, conc(\langle b \rangle, S, \langle b \rangle), \langle b \rangle), \langle a \rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;conc(\langle a \rangle, conc(\langle b \rangle, conc(\langle b \rangle, conc(\langle \epsilon \rangle, \langle \epsilon \rangle, \langle \epsilon \rangle), \langle b \rangle), \langle b \rangle), \langle a \rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;conc(\langle a \rangle, conc(\langle b \rangle, conc(\langle b \rangle, \langle \epsilon \rangle, \langle b \rangle), \langle b \rangle), \langle a \rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;conc(\langle a \rangle, \langle bbbb \rangle, \langle a \rangle)&lt;/math&gt;

==Linear Context-free Rewriting Systems (LCFRSs)==

Weir (1988)&lt;ref name="weir1988" /&gt; describes two properties of composition functions, linearity and regularity. A function defined as &lt;math&gt;f(x_1, ..., x_n) = ...&lt;/math&gt; is linear if and only if each variable appears at most once on either side of the ''='', making &lt;math&gt;f(x) = g(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; linear but not &lt;math&gt;f(x) = g(x, x)&lt;/math&gt;. A function defined as &lt;math&gt;f(x_1, ..., x_n) = ...&lt;/math&gt; is regular if the left hand side and right hand side have exactly the same variables, making &lt;math&gt;f(x, y) = g(y, x)&lt;/math&gt; regular but not &lt;math&gt;f(x) = g(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;f(x, y) = g(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

A grammar in which all composition functions are both linear and regular is called a Linear Context-free Rewriting System (LCFRS). LCFRS is a [[proper subclass]] of the GCFGs, i.e. it has strictly less computational power than the GCFGs as a whole.

On the other hand, LCFRSs are strictly more expressive than [[linear-indexed grammar]]s and their [[equivalence (formal languages)|weakly equivalent]] variant [[tree adjoining grammar]]s (TAGs).&lt;ref name="Kallmeyer2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Kallmeyer|title=Parsing Beyond Context-Free Grammars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5wC0dko1L4C&amp;pg=PA33|year=2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-14846-0|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Head grammar]] is another example of an LCFRS that is strictly less powerful than the class of LCFRSs as a whole. 

LCFRS are weakly equivalent to (set-local) ''multicomponent'' TAGs ([[MCTAG]]s) and also with [[multiple context-free grammar]] (MCFGs [http://www.labri.fr/perso/salvati/downloads/cours/esslli/course1.pdf]).&lt;ref name="Kallmeyer2010b"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laura Kallmeyer|title=Parsing Beyond Context-Free Grammars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5wC0dko1L4C&amp;pg=PA35|year=2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-14846-0|page=35-36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[minimalist grammar]]s (MGs). The languages generated by LCFRS (and their weakly equivalents) can be parsed in [[polynomial time]].&lt;ref name="BenthemMeulen2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Johan F.A.K. van Benthem|author2=Alice ter Meulen|title=Handbook of Logic and Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7yJLmZCbFUC&amp;pg=PA404|year=2010|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-444-53727-0|page=404|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1350">'''Geometric combinatorics''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] in general and [[combinatorics]] in particular.  It includes a number of subareas such as [[polyhedral combinatorics]] (the study of [[Face (geometry)|faces]] of [[convex polyhedron|convex polyhedra]]), [[convex geometry]] (the study of [[convex set]]s, in particular combinatorics of their intersections), and [[discrete geometry]], which in turn has many applications to [[computational geometry]]. Other important areas include [[metric geometry]] of [[polyhedra]], such as the [[Cauchy's theorem (geometry)|Cauchy theorem]] on rigidity of convex polytopes.  The study of [[regular polytope]]s, [[Archimedean solid]]s, and [[kissing number]]s is also a part of geometric combinatorics.  Special polytopes are also considered, such as the [[permutohedron]], [[associahedron]] and [[Birkhoff polytope]].

In [[complex analysis]], the '''Hardy spaces''' (or '''Hardy classes''') ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' are certain [[Space (mathematics)|spaces]] of [[holomorphic function]]s on the [[unit disk]] or [[upper half plane]]. They were introduced by [[Frigyes Riesz]] {{harv|Riesz|1923}}, who named them after [[G. H. Hardy]], because of the paper {{harv|Hardy|1915}}. In [[real analysis]] '''Hardy spaces''' are certain spaces of [[Distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] on the real line, which are (in the sense of distributions) boundary values of the holomorphic functions of the [[complex number|complex]] Hardy spaces, and are related to the [[Lp space|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' spaces]] of [[functional analysis]]. For 1&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;∞ these real Hardy spaces ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' are certain [[subset]]s of ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'', while for ''p'' &lt; 1 the ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' spaces have some undesirable properties, and the Hardy spaces are much better behaved.

There are also higher-dimensional generalizations, consisting of certain holomorphic functions on [[tube domain]]s in the complex case,  or certain spaces of distributions on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; in the real case.

Hardy spaces have a number of applications in [[mathematical analysis]] itself, as well as in [[control theory]] (such as [[H infinity|''H''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; methods]]) and in [[scattering theory]].

==Hardy  spaces for the unit disk==
For  spaces of [[holomorphic function]]s on the open [[unit disk]], the Hardy space ''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; consists of the functions ''f'' whose [[root mean square|mean square value]] on the circle of radius ''r'' remains bounded as ''r'' → 1 from below.

More generally, the Hardy space ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' for 0 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞ is the class of holomorphic functions ''f'' on the open unit disk satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{0\leq r&lt;1}\left(\frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi}\left|f \left (re^{i\theta}\right )\right|^p \; \mathrm{d}\theta\right)^\frac{1}{p}&lt;\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

This class ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a vector space. The number on the left side of the above inequality is the Hardy space ''p''-norm for ''f'', denoted by &lt;math&gt;\|f\|_{H^p}.&lt;/math&gt; It is a norm when ''p'' ≥ 1, but not when 0&amp;nbsp;&lt; ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.

The space ''H''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; is defined as the vector space of bounded holomorphic functions on the disk, with the norm

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_{H^\infty} = \sup_{|z|&lt; 1} \left|f(z)\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

For 0&amp;nbsp;&lt; p&amp;nbsp;≤ q&amp;nbsp;≤ ∞, the class ''H&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;'' is  a [[subset]] of ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'', and the ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-norm is increasing with ''p'' (it is a consequence of [[Hölder's inequality]] that the ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-norm is increasing for [[Probability space|probability measures]], i.e. [[Measure (mathematics)|measures]] with total mass 1).

==Hardy spaces on the unit circle==
The Hardy spaces defined in the preceding section can also be viewed as certain closed vector subspaces of the complex [[Lp space|''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' spaces]] on the unit circle. This connection is provided by the following theorem {{harv|Katznelson|1976|loc=Thm 3.8}}:  Given ''f'' ∈ ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'', with ''p'' ≥ 0,{{clarify|reason=Is p=0 allowed? What about p=∞?|date=February 2017}} the radial limit

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde f\left(e^{i\theta}\right) = \lim_{r\to 1} f\left(re^{i\theta}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

exists for almost every θ. The function &lt;math&gt;\tilde f&lt;/math&gt; belongs to the ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' space for the unit circle,{{clarify|reason=Also when p is less than 1?|date=February 2017}} and one has that

:&lt;math&gt;\|\tilde f\|_{L^p} = \|f\|_{H^p}.&lt;/math&gt;

Denoting the unit circle by '''T''', and by ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') the vector subspace of ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') consisting of all limit functions &lt;math&gt;\tilde f&lt;/math&gt;, when ''f'' varies in ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'', one then has that for ''p''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1,{{harv|Katznelson|1976}}

:&lt;math&gt;g\in H^p\left(\mathbf{T}\right)\text{ if and only if } g\in L^p\left(\mathbf{T}\right)\text{ and } \hat{g}(n)=0 \text{ for all } n &lt; 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''ĝ''(''n'') are the [[Fourier coefficients]] of a function ''g'' integrable on the unit circle,

:&lt;math&gt;\forall n \in \mathbf{Z}, \ \ \ \hat{g}(n) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} g\left(e^{i\phi}\right) e^{-in\phi} \, \mathrm{d}\phi.&lt;/math&gt;

The space ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') is a closed subspace of ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T'''). Since ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') is a [[Banach space]] (for 1 ≤ ''p'' ≤ ∞), so is ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''').

The above can be turned around.  Given a function &lt;math&gt;\tilde f&lt;/math&gt; ∈ ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T'''), with ''p'' ≥ 1, one can regain a ([[Harmonic function|harmonic]]) function ''f'' on the unit disk by means of the [[Poisson kernel]] ''P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;f\left(re^{i\theta}\right)=\frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} P_r(\theta-\phi) \tilde f\left(e^{i\phi}\right) \,\mathrm{d}\phi, \quad r &lt; 1,&lt;/math&gt;

and ''f'' belongs to ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' exactly when &lt;math&gt;\tilde f&lt;/math&gt; is in ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T'''). Supposing that &lt;math&gt;\tilde f&lt;/math&gt; is in ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T'''). ''i.e.'' that &lt;math&gt;\tilde f&lt;/math&gt; has Fourier coefficients (''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''∈'''Z'''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0 for every ''n'' &lt; 0,then the element ''f'' of the Hardy space ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' associated to &lt;math&gt;\tilde f&lt;/math&gt; is the holomorphic function

:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n z^n, \ \ \ |z| &lt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;

In applications, those functions with vanishing negative Fourier coefficients are commonly interpreted as the [[causal]] solutions.{{clarify|reason=Causal solutions of what? Of the integral? Link to causal brings no enlightenment. Maybe [[Filter]], [[Laplace Transform]], [[Transfer Function]], or something?|date=February 2017}}  Thus, the space ''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is seen to sit naturally inside ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; space, and is represented by [[infinite sequence]]s indexed by '''N'''; whereas ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; consists of [[bi-infinite sequence]]s indexed by '''Z'''.

=== Connection to real Hardy spaces on the circle===
When 1 ≤ ''p'' &lt; ∞, the ''real Hardy spaces'' ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' discussed further down{{clarify|reason=This section is simply misplaced. It should be integrated into the section on real Hardy spaces.|date=February 2017}} in this article are easy to describe in the present context. A real function ''f'' on the unit circle belongs to the real Hardy space ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') if it is the real part of a function in ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T'''), and a complex function ''f'' belongs to the real Hardy space iff Re(''f'') and Im(''f'') belong to the space (see the section on real Hardy spaces below). Thus for 1 ≤ ''p'' &lt; ∞, the real Hardy space contains the Hardy space, but is much bigger, since no relationship is imposed between the real and imaginary part of the function.

For 0 &lt; ''p'' &lt; 1, such tools as Fourier coefficients, Poisson integral, conjugate function, are no longer valid. For example, consider the function

:&lt;math&gt; F(z) = \frac{1 + z}{1 - z}, \quad |z| &lt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Then ''F'' is in ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' for every 0 &lt; ''p'' &lt; 1, and the radial limit

:&lt;math&gt;f(e^{i\theta}):= \lim_{r\to1} F(r e^{i\theta}) = i \, \cot(\tfrac{\theta}{2}).&lt;/math&gt;

exists for a.e. ''θ'' and is in ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T'''), but Re(''f'') is 0 almost everywhere, so it is no longer possible to recover ''F'' from Re(''f''). As a consequence of this example, one sees that for 0 &lt; ''p'' &lt; 1, one cannot characterize the real-''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') (defined below) in the simple way given above,{{clarify|reason=What way is this? As boundary values, or as a.e. boundary values? The latter clearly fails, but the former seems to work, as we see in the next line.|date=February 2017}} but must use the actual definition using maximal functions, which is given further along somewhere below.

For the same function ''F'', let ''f&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''(e&lt;sup&gt;iθ&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''F''(''re''&lt;sup&gt;iθ&lt;/sup&gt;). The limit when ''r'' → 1 of Re(''f&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''), ''in the sense of'' [[Distribution (mathematics)|''distributions'']] on the circle, is a non-zero multiple of the [[Dirac distribution]] at ''z'' = 1. The Dirac distribution at a point of the unit circle belongs to real-''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') for every ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 (see below).

==Factorization into inner and outer functions (Beurling)==
For 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;∞, every non-zero function ''f'' in ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' can be written as the product ''f'' = ''Gh'' where ''G'' is an ''outer function'' and ''h'' is an ''inner function'', as defined below {{harv|Rudin|1987|loc=Thm 17.17}}. This "[[Arne Beurling|Beurling]] factorization" allows the Hardy space to be completely characterized by the spaces of inner and outer functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beurling, Arne|title=On two problems concerning linear transformations in Hilbert space|journal= [[Acta Mathematica]] |volume=81|year=1948|pages=239–255|doi=10.1007/BF02395019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inner and outer functions on Riemann surfaces|author=Voichick, Michael|author2=Zalcman, Lawrence|authorlink2=Lawrence Zalcman|journal= [[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=16|issue=6|year=1965 |pages=1200–1204|doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-1965-0183883-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One says that ''G''(''z''){{clarify|rason=What is the doamin?|date=February 2017}} is an '''outer (exterior) function''' if it takes the form

:&lt;math&gt;G(z) = c\, \exp\left(\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\frac{e^{i\theta}+z}{e^{i\theta}-z} \log\!\left(\varphi\!\left(e^{i\theta} \right)\right)\, \mathrm{d}\theta \right)&lt;/math&gt;

for some complex number ''c'' with |''c''| = 1, and some positive measurable function &lt;math&gt;\varphi &lt;/math&gt; on the unit circle such that &lt;math&gt;\log(\varphi) &lt;/math&gt; is integrable on the circle.  In particular, when &lt;math&gt;\varphi &lt;/math&gt; is integrable on the circle, ''G'' is in ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; because the above takes the form of the [[Poisson kernel]] {{harv|Rudin|1987|loc=Thm 17.16}}.  This implies that

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{r\to 1^-}\left|G\left (re^{i\theta} \right)\right| = \varphi \left(e^{i\theta}\right )&lt;/math&gt;

for almost every θ.

One says that ''h'' is an '''inner (interior) function''' if and only if |''h''|&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1 on the unit disk and the limit

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{r\to 1^-} h(re^{i\theta})&lt;/math&gt;

exists for [[almost all]] θ and its [[Absolute value|modulus]] is equal to 1 a.e.  In particular, ''h'' is in ''H''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;.{{clarify|reason=Is the converse also true?|date=February 2017}} The inner function can be further factored into a form involving a [[Blaschke product]].

The function ''f'', decomposed as ''f'' = ''Gh'',{{clarify|reason=Very confusing. What class of functions is f drawn from? Is the decomposition supposed to exist or be unique?|date=February 2017}} is in ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' if and only if φ belongs to ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T'''), where φ is the positive function in the representation of the outer function ''G''.

Let ''G'' be an outer function represented as above from a function φ on the circle. Replacing φ by φ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;, α &gt; 0, a family (''G''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;) of outer functions is obtained, with the properties:

:''G''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= ''G'', ''G''&lt;sub&gt;α+β&lt;/sub&gt; = ''G''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''G''&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp; and |''G''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;| = |''G''|&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; almost everywhere on the circle.

It follows that whenever 0 &lt; ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' &lt; ∞ and 1/''r'' = 1/''p'' + 1/''q'', every function ''f'' in ''H&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;'' can be expressed as the product of a function in ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' and a function in ''H&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;''. For example: every function in ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the product of two functions in ''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; every function in ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''p'' &lt; 1, can be expressed as product of several functions in some ''H&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''q''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

== Real-variable techniques on the unit circle ==
Real-variable techniques, mainly associated to the study of ''real Hardy spaces'' defined on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; (see below), are also used in the simpler framework of the circle. It is a common practice to allow for complex functions (or distributions) in these "real" spaces.  The definition that follows does not distinguish between real or complex case.

Let ''P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' denote the Poisson kernel on the unit circle '''T'''. For a distribution ''f'' on the unit circle, set

:&lt;math&gt;(M f)(e^{i\theta})=\sup_{0&lt;r&lt;1} \left |(f * P_r) \left(e^{i\theta} \right)\right|,&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''star'' indicates convolution between the distribution ''f'' and the function e&lt;sup&gt;iθ&lt;/sup&gt; → ''P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''(θ) on the circle.  Namely, (''f'' ∗ ''P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'')(e&lt;sup&gt;iθ&lt;/sup&gt;) is the result of the action of ''f'' on the ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;-function defined on the unit circle by

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i\varphi} \rightarrow P_r(\theta - \varphi).&lt;/math&gt;

For 0&amp;nbsp;&lt; ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt; ∞, the ''real Hardy space'' ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') consists of distributions ''f'' such that ''M&amp;nbsp;f''&amp;thinsp; is in ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''').

The function ''F'' defined on the unit disk by ''F''(''re''&lt;sup&gt;iθ&lt;/sup&gt;) = (''f'' ∗ ''P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'')(e&lt;sup&gt;iθ&lt;/sup&gt;) is harmonic, and ''M&amp;nbsp;f''&amp;thinsp; is the ''radial maximal function'' of ''F''. When ''M&amp;nbsp;f''&amp;thinsp; belongs to ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') and ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;1, the distribution ''f''&amp;thinsp; "''is''" a function in ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T'''), namely the boundary value of ''F''. For ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge; 1, the ''real Hardy space'' ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') is a subset of ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''').

=== Conjugate function ===
To every real trigonometric polynomial ''u'' on the unit circle, one associates the real ''conjugate polynomial'' ''v'' such that ''u'' + i''v'' extends to a holomorphic function in the unit disk,

:&lt;math&gt; u(e^{i\theta}) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{k \ge 1} a_k \cos(k \theta) + b_k \sin(k \theta) \longrightarrow v(e^{i\theta}) = \sum_{k \ge 1} a_k \sin(k \theta) - b_k \cos(k \theta). &lt;/math&gt;

This mapping ''u'' → ''v'' extends to a bounded linear operator ''H'' on ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T'''), when 1&amp;nbsp;&lt; ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt; ∞ (up to a scalar multiple, it is the [[Hilbert transform]] on the unit circle), and ''H'' also maps ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') to [[Lp space#Weak Lp|weak-''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''')]]. When 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;le; ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt; ∞, the following are equivalent for a ''real valued'' integrable function ''f'' on the unit circle:
* the function ''f'' is the real part of some function ''g'' ∈ ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''')
* the function ''f'' and its conjugate ''H(f)'' belong to ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''')
* the radial maximal function ''M f''&amp;thinsp;  belongs to ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''').

When 1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞, ''H(f)'' belongs to ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') when ''f'' ∈ ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T'''), hence the real Hardy space ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') coincides with ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') in this case. For ''p'' = 1,  the real Hardy space ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') is a proper subspace of ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''').

The case of ''p'' = ∞ was excluded from the definition of real Hardy spaces, because the maximal function ''M&amp;nbsp;f''&amp;thinsp; of an ''L''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; function is always bounded, and because it is not desirable that real-''H''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; be equal to ''L''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the two following properties are equivalent for a real valued function ''f''
* the function ''f''&amp;thinsp; is the real part of some function ''g'' ∈ ''H''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''')
* the function ''f''&amp;thinsp; and its conjugate ''H(f)'' belong to ''L''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''').

=== Real Hardy spaces for 0 &lt; ''p'' &lt; 1 ===
When 0 &lt; ''p'' &lt; 1, a function ''F'' in ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' cannot be reconstructed from the real part of its boundary limit ''function'' on the circle, because of the lack of convexity of ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' in this case.  Convexity fails but a kind of "''complex convexity''" remains, namely the fact that ''z'' → |''z''|&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; is [[Subharmonic function#Subharmonic functions in the complex plane|subharmonic]] for every ''q'' &gt; 0. As a consequence, if

:&lt;math&gt; F(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_n z^n, \quad |z| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

is in ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'', it can be shown that ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;1/''p''–1&lt;/sup&gt;). It follows that the Fourier series

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} c_n e^{in \theta}&lt;/math&gt;

converges in the sense of distributions to a distribution ''f'' on the unit circle, and ''F''(''re''&lt;sup&gt;iθ&lt;/sup&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=(''f''&amp;nbsp;∗&amp;nbsp;''P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'')(θ).  The function ''F'' ∈ ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' can be reconstructed from the real distribution Re(''f'') on the circle, because the Taylor coefficients ''c&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' of ''F'' can be computed from the Fourier coefficients of Re(''f'').

Distributions on the circle are general enough for handling Hardy spaces when ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1. Distributions that are not functions do occur{{where|date=February 2017}}, as is seen with functions ''F''(''z'') = (1−''z'')&lt;sup&gt;−''N''&lt;/sup&gt; (for |''z''| &lt; 1), that belong to ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' when 0&amp;nbsp;&lt; ''N''&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt; 1 (and ''N'' an integer ≥&amp;nbsp;1).

A real distribution on the circle belongs to real-''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') iff it is the boundary value of the real part of some ''F'' ∈ ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''. A Dirac distribution δ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, at any point ''x'' of the unit circle, belongs to real-''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''T''') for every ''p'' &lt; 1; derivatives δ′&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; belong when ''p'' &lt; 1/2, second derivatives δ′′&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; when ''p'' &lt; 1/3, and so on.

==Hardy spaces for the upper half plane==
It is possible to define Hardy spaces on other domains than the disc, and in many applications Hardy spaces on a complex half-plane (usually the right half-plane or upper half-plane) are used.

The Hardy space ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''H''') on the [[upper half-plane]] '''H''' is defined to be the space of holomorphic functions ''f'' on '''H''' with bounded (quasi-)norm, the norm being given by

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_{H^p} = \sup_{y&gt;0} \left ( \int|f(x+ iy)|^p\, \mathrm{d}x \right)^{\frac{1}{p}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The corresponding ''H''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''H''') is defined as functions of bounded norm, with the norm given by

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_{H^\infty} = \sup_{z\in\mathbf{H}}|f(z)|.&lt;/math&gt;

Although the [[unit disk]] '''D''' and the upper half-plane '''H''' can be mapped to one another by means of [[Möbius transformation]]s, they are not interchangeable{{clarify|reason=What statement fails, exactly? The caveat seems to be contradicted by the theorem that immediately follows.|date=February 2017}} as domains for Hardy spaces. Contributing to this difference is the fact that the unit circle has finite (one-dimensional) [[Lebesgue measure]] while the real line does not.  However, for [[H square|''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], one has the following theorem: if ''m'' : '''D''' → '''H''' denotes the Möbius transformation

:&lt;math&gt;m(z)= i \cdot \frac{1+z}{1-z}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the linear operator ''M'' : ''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''H''') → ''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''D''') defined by

:&lt;math&gt;(Mf)(z):=\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{1-z} f(m(z)).&lt;/math&gt;

is an [[isometry|isometric]] [[isomorphism]] of Hilbert spaces.

==Real Hardy spaces for '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;==
In analysis on the real vector space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the Hardy space{{clarify|reason=The terminology is confusing. Is this the Hardy space, or the real Hardy space?|date=February 2017}}  ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' (for 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;∞) consists of [[Distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform|tempered distributions]]{{clarify|reason=Is anything gained by bringing in distributions? Why tempered? Why not just work with locally integrable functions?|date=February 2017}}  ''f'' such that for some [[Schwartz function]] Φ with ∫Φ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the [[maximal function]]

:&lt;math&gt;(M_\Phi f)(x)=\sup_{t&gt;0}|(f*\Phi_t)(x)|&lt;/math&gt;

is in ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;),{{clarify|reason=Are the distributions complex valued? Confusing to call it a real Hardy space then.|date=February 2017}} where ∗ is convolution and {{nowrap|Φ&lt;sub&gt;''t''&amp;thinsp;&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') {{=}}}} {{nowrap|''t''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;&amp;minus;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;Φ(''x''&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;''t'')}}. The ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-[[quasinorm]] ||''f''&amp;thinsp;||&lt;sub&gt;''Hp''&lt;/sub&gt; of a distribution ''f'' of ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' is defined to be the ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' norm of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;Φ&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' (this depends on the choice of Φ, but different choices of Schwartz functions Φ give equivalent norms).  The ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-quasinorm is a norm when ''p'' ≥ 1, but not when ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1.

If 1&amp;nbsp;&lt; ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt; ∞, the Hardy space ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the same vector space as ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'', with equivalent norm. When ''p''&amp;nbsp;= 1, the Hardy space ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is a proper subspace of ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  One can find sequences in ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; that are bounded in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; but unbounded in ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, for example on the line

:&lt;math&gt; f_k(x) = \mathbf{1}_{[0, 1]}(x - k) -  \mathbf{1}_{[0, 1]}(x + k), \ \ \ k &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; norms are not equivalent on ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is not closed in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  The dual of ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is the space ''BMO'' of functions of [[bounded mean oscillation]].  The space ''BMO'' contains unbounded functions (proving again that ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is not closed in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

If ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 then the Hardy space ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' has elements that are not functions, and its dual{{clarify|reason=What is th dual if it's not a normed space?|date=February 2017}} is the homogeneous Lipschitz space of order ''n''(1/''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1). When ''p'' &lt; 1, the ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-quasinorm is not  a norm, as it is not subadditive. The ''p''th power ||''f''&amp;thinsp;||&lt;sub&gt;''Hp''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; is subadditive for ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 and so defines a metric on the Hardy space ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'', which defines the topology and makes ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' into a complete metric space.

=== Atomic decomposition ===
When 0 &lt; ''p'' ≤ 1, a bounded measurable function ''f'' of compact support is in the Hardy space ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' if and only if all its moments

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbf{R}^n} f(x)x_1^{i_1}\ldots x_n^{i_n}\, \mathrm{d}x, &lt;/math&gt;

whose order ''i''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+ ... +''i&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is at most ''n''(1/''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1), vanish. For example, the integral of ''f'' must vanish in order that ''f'' ∈ ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'', 0&amp;nbsp;&lt; ''p'' ≤ 1, and as long as ''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt; {{nowrap|''n''&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;(''n''+1)}} this is also sufficient.

If in addition ''f'' has support in some ball ''B'' and is bounded by |''B''|&lt;sup&gt;−1/''p''&lt;/sup&gt; then ''f'' is called an '''''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-atom''' (here |''B''| denotes the Euclidean volume of ''B'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;).  The ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-quasinorm of an arbitrary ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-atom is bounded by a constant depending only on ''p'' and on the Schwartz function Φ.

When 0 &lt; ''p'' ≤ 1, any element ''f'' of ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' has an '''atomic decomposition''' as a convergent infinite combination of ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-atoms,

:&lt;math&gt;f = \sum c_j a_j, \ \ \ \sum |c_j|^p &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' are ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-atoms and the ''c&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' are scalars.

On the line for example, the difference of Dirac distributions ''f''&amp;nbsp;= δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−δ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be represented as a series of [[Haar wavelet|Haar functions]], convergent in ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-quasinorm when 1/2&amp;nbsp;&lt; ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1 (on the circle, the corresponding representation is valid for 0&amp;nbsp;&lt; ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt; 1, but on the line, Haar functions do not belong to ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' when ''p'' ≤ 1/2 because their maximal function is equivalent at infinity to ''a''&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; for some ''a''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0).

==Martingale ''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''==
Let (''M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''≥0&lt;/sub&gt; be a [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingale]] on some probability space (Ω,&amp;nbsp;Σ,&amp;nbsp;''P''), with respect to an increasing sequence of σ-fields (Σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''≥0&lt;/sub&gt;. Assume for simplicity that Σ is equal to the σ-field generated by the sequence (Σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''≥0&lt;/sub&gt;. The ''maximal function'' of the martingale is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; M^* = \sup_{n \ge 0} \, |M_n|.&lt;/math&gt;

Let 1 ≤ ''p'' &lt; ∞. The martingale (''M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''≥0&lt;/sub&gt; belongs to ''martingale''-''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' when ''M*'' ∈ ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''.

If ''M*'' ∈ ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'', the martingale (''M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''≥0&lt;/sub&gt; is bounded in ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''; hence it converges almost surely to some function ''f'' by the [[Doob's martingale convergence theorems|martingale convergence theorem]]. Moreover, ''M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' converges to ''f'' in ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-norm by the [[dominated convergence theorem]]; hence ''M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be expressed as conditional expectation of ''f'' on Σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;. It is thus possible to identify martingale-''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' with the subspace of ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω,&amp;nbsp;Σ,&amp;nbsp;''P'') consisting of those ''f'' such that the martingale

:&lt;math&gt;M_n = \operatorname E \bigl( f | \Sigma_n \bigr)&lt;/math&gt;

belongs to martingale-''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''.

[[Doob's martingale inequality|Doob's maximal inequality]] implies that martingale-''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' coincides with ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''(Ω,&amp;nbsp;Σ,&amp;nbsp;''P'') when 1 &lt; ''p'' &lt; ∞.  The interesting space is martingale-''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, whose dual is martingale-BMO {{harv|Garsia|1973}}.

The Burkholder–Gundy inequalities (when ''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1) and the Burgess Davis inequality (when ''p'' = 1) relate the ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-norm of the maximal function to that of the ''square function'' of the martingale

:&lt;math&gt; S(f) = \left( |M_0|^2 + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} |M_{n+1} - M_n|^2 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

Martingale-''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' can be defined by saying that ''S''(''f'')∈ ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{harv|Garsia|1973}}.

Martingales with continuous time parameter can also be considered. A direct link with the classical theory is obtained via the complex [[Wiener process|Brownian motion]] (''B&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'') in the complex plane, starting from the point ''z'' = 0 at time ''t'' = 0. Let τ denote the hitting time of the unit circle. For every holomorphic function ''F'' in the unit disk,

:&lt;math&gt; M_t = F(B_{t \wedge \tau}) &lt;/math&gt;

is a martingale, that belongs to martingale-''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' iff ''F''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''H&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;'' {{Harv |Burkholder|Gundy|Silverstein|1971}}.

=== Example: dyadic martingale-''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; ===
In this example, Ω = [0, 1] and Σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the finite field generated by the dyadic partition of [0, 1] into 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; intervals of length 2&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;,  for every ''n'' ≥ 0. If a function ''f'' on [0, 1] is represented by its expansion on the [[Haar wavelet|Haar system]] (''h&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'')

:&lt;math&gt; f = \sum c_k h_k,&lt;/math&gt;

then the martingale-''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; norm of ''f'' can be defined by the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; norm of the square function

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^1 \Bigl( \sum |c_k h_k(x)|^2 \Bigr)^{\frac{1}{2}} \, \mathrm{d}x.&lt;/math&gt;

This space, sometimes denoted by ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(δ), is isomorphic to the classical real ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; space on the circle {{harv |Müller|2005}}.  The Haar system is an [[Schauder basis|unconditional basis]] for ''H''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(δ).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5729">'''Head grammar''' ('''HG''') is a grammar formalism introduced in [[Carl Pollard]] (1984)&lt;ref name="pollard1984"&gt;[[Carl Pollard|Pollard, C.]] 1984. ''Generalized Phrase Structure Grammars, Head Grammars, and Natural Language''. Ph.D. thesis, Stanford University, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; as an extension of the [[context-free grammar]] class of grammars. Head grammar is therefore a type of [[phrase structure grammar]], as opposed to a [[dependency grammar]]. The class of head grammars is a subset of the [[Generalized context-free grammar#Linear Context-free Rewriting Systems .28LCFRSs.29|linear context-free rewriting systems]].

One typical way of defining head grammars is to replace the terminal strings of CFGs with indexed terminal strings, where the index denotes the "head" word of the string. Thus, for example, a CF rule such as &lt;math&gt;A \to abc&lt;/math&gt; might instead be &lt;math&gt;A \to (abc, 0)&lt;/math&gt;, where the 0th terminal, the ''a'', is the head of the resulting terminal string. For convenience of notation, such a rule could be written as just the terminal string, with the head terminal denoted by some sort of mark, as in &lt;math&gt;A \to \widehat{a}bc&lt;/math&gt;.

Two fundamental operations are then added to all rewrite rules: wrapping and concatenation.

Wrapping is an operation on two headed strings defined as follows:

Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha \widehat{x} \beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma \widehat{y} \delta&lt;/math&gt; be terminal strings headed by ''x'' and ''y'', respectively.

&lt;math&gt;w(\alpha \widehat{x} \beta, \gamma \widehat{y} \delta) = \alpha x \gamma \widehat{y} \delta \beta&lt;/math&gt;

===Concatenation===

Concatenation is a family of operations on n &gt; 0 headed strings, defined for n = 1, 2, 3 as follows:

Let &lt;math&gt;\alpha \widehat{x} \beta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma \widehat{y} \delta&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\zeta \widehat{z} \eta&lt;/math&gt; be terminal strings headed by ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', respectively.

&lt;math&gt;c_{1,0}(\alpha \widehat{x} \beta) = \alpha \widehat{x} \beta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{2,0}(\alpha \widehat{x} \beta, \gamma \widehat{y} \delta) = \alpha \widehat{x} \beta \gamma y \delta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{2,1}(\alpha \widehat{x} \beta, \gamma \widehat{y} \delta) = \alpha x \beta \gamma \widehat{y} \delta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{3,0}(\alpha \widehat{x} \beta, \gamma \widehat{y} \delta, \zeta \widehat{z} \eta) = \alpha \widehat{x} \beta \gamma y \delta \zeta z \eta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{3,1}(\alpha \widehat{x} \beta, \gamma \widehat{y} \delta, \zeta \widehat{z} \eta) = \alpha x \beta \gamma \widehat{y} \delta \zeta z \eta&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{3,2}(\alpha \widehat{x} \beta, \gamma \widehat{y} \delta, \zeta \widehat{z} \eta) = \alpha x \beta \gamma y \delta \zeta \widehat{z} \eta&lt;/math&gt;

And so on for &lt;math&gt;c_{m,n} : 0 \leq n &lt; m&lt;/math&gt;. One can sum up the pattern here simply as "concatenate some number of terminal strings ''m'', with the head of string ''n'' designated as the head of the resulting string".

===Form of rules===

Head grammar rules are defined in terms of these two operations, with rules taking either of the forms

&lt;math&gt;X \to w(\alpha, \beta)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;X \to c_{m,n}(\alpha, \beta, ...)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, ... are each either a terminal string or a non-terminal symbol.

==Example==

Head grammars are capable of generating the language &lt;math&gt;\{ a^n b^n c^n d^n : n \geq 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. We can define the grammar as follows:

&lt;math&gt;S \to c_{1,0}(\widehat{\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;S \to c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, T, \widehat{d})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T \to w(S, \widehat{b}c)&lt;/math&gt;

The derivation for "abcd" is thus:

&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, T, \widehat{d})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, w(S, \widehat{b}c), \widehat{d})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, w(c_{1,0}(\widehat{\epsilon}), \widehat{b}c), \widehat{d})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, w(\widehat{\epsilon}, \widehat{b}c), \widehat{d})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, \widehat{b}c, \widehat{d})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a\widehat{b}cd&lt;/math&gt;

And for "{{not a typo|aabbccdd}}":

&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, T, \widehat{d})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, w(S, \widehat{b}c), \widehat{d})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, w(c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, T, \widehat{d}), \widehat{b}c), \widehat{d})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, w(c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, w(S, \widehat{b}c), \widehat{d}), \widehat{b}c), \widehat{d})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, w(c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, w(c_{1,0}(\widehat{\epsilon}), \widehat{b}c), \widehat{d}), \widehat{b}c), \widehat{d})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, w(c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, w(\widehat{\epsilon}, \widehat{b}c), \widehat{d}), \widehat{b}c), \widehat{d})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, w(c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, \widehat{b}c, \widehat{d}), \widehat{b}c), \widehat{d})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, w(a\widehat{b}cd, \widehat{b}c), \widehat{d})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;c_{3,1}(\widehat{a}, ab\widehat{b}ccd, \widehat{d})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;aab\widehat{b}ccdd&lt;/math&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''Hermitian symmetric space''' is a [[Hermitian manifold]] which at every point has as an inversion symmetry preserving the Hermitian structure. First studied by [[Élie Cartan]], they form a natural generalization of the notion of [[Riemannian symmetric space]] from [[real manifold]]s to [[complex manifold]]s.

Every Hermitian symmetric space is a homogeneous space for its isometry group and has a unique decomposition as a product of irreducible spaces and a Euclidean space. The irreducible spaces arise in pairs as a non-compact space that, as [[Armand Borel|Borel]] showed, can be embedded as an open subspace of its compact dual space. [[Harish Chandra]] showed that each non-compact space can be realized as a '''bounded symmetric domain''' in a complex vector space. The simplest case involves the groups SU(2), SU(1,1) and their common complexification SL(2,'''C'''). In this case the non-compact space is the [[unit disk]], a homogeneous space for SU(1,1). It is a bounded domain in the complex plane '''C'''. The one-point compactification of '''C''', the [[Riemann sphere]], is the dual space, a homogeneous space for SU(2) and SL(2,'''C''').

Irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric spaces are exactly the homogeneous spaces of simple compact Lie groups by maximal closed connected subgroups which contain a maximal torus and have center isomorphic to '''T'''.  There is a complete classification of irreducible spaces, with four classical series, studied by Cartan, and two exceptional cases; the classification can be deduced from
[[Borel–de Siebenthal theory]], which classifies closed connected subgroups containing a maximal torus. Hermitian symmetric spaces appear in the theory of [[Jordan triple system]]s, [[several complex variables]], [[complex geometry]], [[automorphic form]]s and [[group representation]]s, in particular permitting the construction of the [[holomorphic discrete series representation]]s of semisimple Lie groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knapp|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type==

===Definition===
Let ''H'' be a connected compact semisimple Lie group, σ an automorphism of ''H'' of order 2 and ''H''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; the fixed point subgroup of σ.  Let ''K'' be a closed subgroup of ''H'' lying between ''H''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; and its [[identity component]]. The compact homogeneous space ''H'' / ''K'' is called a [[symmetric space|symmetric space of compact type]]. The Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; admits a decomposition

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{h}=\mathfrak{k}\oplus\mathfrak{m},}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;, the Lie algebra of ''K'', is the +1 eigenspace of σ and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; the –1 eigenspace.
If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; contains no simple summand of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;, the pair (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;, σ) is called an [[orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra]] of ''compact type''.&lt;ref name="Wolf-2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;, invariant under the [[adjoint representation]] and σ, induces a Riemannian structure on ''H'' / ''K'', with ''H'' acting by isometries. A canonical example is given by minus the [[Killing form]]. Under such an inner product, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal. ''H'' / ''K'' is then a Riemannian symmetric space of compact type.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is called a '''Hermitian symmetric space''' if it has an [[almost complex structure]] preserving the Riemannian metric. This is equivalent to the existence of a linear map ''J'' with ''J''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = −''I'' on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; which preserves the inner product and commutes with the action of ''K''.

===Symmetry and center of isotropy subgroup===
If (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;,σ) is Hermitian, ''K'' has non-trivial center and the symmetry σ is inner, implemented by an element of the center of ''K''.

In fact ''J'' lies in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and exp ''tJ'' forms a one-parameter group in the center of ''K''.  This follows because if ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' lie in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;, then by the invariance of the inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|pp=149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{([[A,B],C],D)=([A,B],[C,D])=([[C,D],B],A).}&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing ''A'' and ''B'' by ''JA'' and ''JB'', it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{[JA,JB] = [A,B].}&lt;/math&gt;

Define a linear map δ on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; by extending ''J'' to be 0 on  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;. The last relation shows that δ is a derivation of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; is semisimple, δ must be an inner derivation, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\delta(X)=[T + A,X],}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''T'' in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and ''A'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;. Taking ''X'' in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that ''A'' = 0 and ''T'' lies in the center of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and hence that ''K'' is non-semisimple. The symmetry σ is implemented by ''z'' = exp π''T'' and the almost complex structure by exp π/2 ''T''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|pp=261–262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The innerness of σ implies that ''K'' contains a maximal torus of ''H'', so has maximal rank. On the other hand, the centralizer of the subgroup generated by the torus ''S'' of elements exp ''tT'' is connected, since if ''x'' is any element in ''K'' there is a maximal torus containing ''x'' and ''S'',  which lies in the centralizer. On the other hand, it contains ''K'' since ''S'' is central in ''K'' and is contained in ''K'' since ''z'' lies in ''S''. So ''K'' is the centralizer of ''S'' and hence connected. In particular ''K'' contains the center of ''H''.&lt;ref name="Wolf-2010" /&gt;

===Irreducible decomposition===
The symmetric space or the pair (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;, σ) is said to be ''irreducible'' if the adjoint action of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; (or equivalently the identity component of ''H''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; or  ''K'') is irreducible on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;. This is equivalent to the maximality of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; as a subalgebra.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|p=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact there is a one-one correspondence between intermediate subalgebras &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{l}&lt;/math&gt; and ''K''-invariant subspaces 
&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_1&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{l}=\mathfrak{k}\oplus \mathfrak{m}_1,\,\,\,\ \mathfrak{m}_1=\mathfrak{l}\cap \mathfrak{m}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Any orthogonal symmetric algebra  (&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;, σ) of Hermitian type can be decomposed as an (orthogonal) direct sum of irreducible orthogonal symmetric algebras of Hermitian type.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=378–379}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; can be written as a direct sum of simple algebras

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathfrak{h}=\oplus_{i=1}^N \mathfrak{h}_i,}&lt;/math&gt;

each of which is left invariant by the automorphism σ and the complex structure ''J'', since they are both inner. The eigenspace decomposition of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}_1&lt;/math&gt; coincides with its intersections with &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;. So the restriction of σ to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}_1&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible.

This decomposition of the orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra yields a direct product decomposition of the corresponding compact symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' when ''H'' is simply connected. In this case the fixed point subgroup ''H''&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; is automatically connected. For simply connected ''H'', the symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is the direct product of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; simply connected and simple. In the irreducible case, ''K'' is a maximal connected subgroup of ''H''. Since ''K'' acts irreducibly on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; (regarded as a complex space for the complex structure defined by ''J''), the center of ''K'' is a one-dimensional torus '''T''', given by the operators exp ''tT''. Since each ''H'' is simply connected and ''K'' connected, the quotient ''H''/''K'' is simply connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complex structure===
{{Main article|Complex structures on homogeneous spaces}}
if ''H'' / ''K'' is irreducible with ''K'' non-semisimple, the compact group ''H'' must be simple and ''K'' of maximal rank. From [[Borel-de Siebenthal theory]], the involution σ is inner and ''K'' is the centralizer of its center, which is isomorphic to '''T'''. In particular ''K'' is connected. It follows that ''H'' / ''K'' is simply connected and there is a [[parabolic subgroup]] ''P'' in the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] ''G'' of ''H'' such that ''H'' / ''K'' = ''G'' / ''P''. In particular there is a complex structure on ''H'' / ''K'' and the action of ''H'' is holomorphic. Since any Hermitian symmetric space is a product of irreducible spaces, the same is true in general.

At the [[Lie algebra]] level, there is a symmetric decomposition
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h = \mathfrak k\oplus\mathfrak m,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak m,J)&lt;/math&gt; is a real vector space with a complex structure ''J'', whose complex dimension is given in the table. Correspondingly, there is a [[graded Lie algebra]] decomposition
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak g = \mathfrak{m}_{+}\oplus\mathfrak l\oplus\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m\otimes\mathbb C= \mathfrak m_{-}\oplus\mathfrak m_{+}&lt;/math&gt; is the decomposition into +''i'' and &amp;minus;''i'' eigenspaces of ''J'' and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak l=\mathfrak k\otimes\mathbb C&lt;/math&gt;. The Lie algebra of ''P'' is the semidirect product &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m^{+}\oplus\mathfrak l&lt;/math&gt;. The complex Lie algebras  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_\pm&lt;/math&gt; are Abelian. Indeed, if ''U'' and ''V'' lie in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_\pm&lt;/math&gt;, [''U'',''V''] = ''J''[''U'',''V''] = [''JU'',''JV''] = [±''iU'',±''iV''] = –[''U'',''V''], so the Lie bracket must vanish.

The complex subspaces &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_\pm&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_{\mathbb C}&lt;/math&gt; are irreducible for the action of ''K'', since ''J'' commutes with ''K'' so that each is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; with complex structure ±''J''.  Equivalently the centre '''T''' of ''K'' acts on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_+&lt;/math&gt; by the identity representation and on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt; by its conjugate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mok|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The realization of ''H''/''K'' as a generalized flag variety ''G''/''P'' is obtained by taking ''G'' as in the table (the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] of ''H'') and ''P'' to be the [[parabolic subgroup]] equal to the semidirect product of ''L'', the complexification of ''K'', with the complex Abelian subgroup exp &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_+&lt;/math&gt;. (In the language of [[algebraic groups]],  ''L'' is the [[Levi factor]] of ''P''.)

===Classification===
Any Hermitian symmetric space of compact type is simply connected and can be written as a direct product of irreducible hermitian symmetric spaces ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; simple, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; connected of maximal rank with center '''T'''. The irreducible ones are therefore exactly the non-semisimple cases classified by [[Borel–de Siebenthal theory]].&lt;ref name="Wolf-2010" /&gt;
 
Accordingly, the irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric spaces ''H''/''K'' are classified as follows.

In terms of the classification of compact Riemannian symmetric spaces, the Hermitian symmetric spaces are the four infinite series AIII, DIII, CI and BDI with ''p'' = 2 or ''q'' = 2, and two exceptional spaces, namely EIII and EVII.

===Classical examples===
The irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type are all simply connected. The corresponding symmetry σ of the simply connected simple compact Lie group is inner, given by conjugation by the unique element ''S'' in ''Z''(''K'') / ''Z''(''H'') of period 2. For the classical groups, as in the table above, these symmetries are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=444–447,451–455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*AIII: &lt;math&gt;S=\begin{pmatrix}-\alpha I_p &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; \alpha I_q\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; in S(U(''p'')×U(''q'')), where α&lt;sup&gt;''p''+''q''&lt;/sup&gt;=(−1)&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;.
*DIII: ''S'' = ''iI'' in U(''n'') ⊂ SO(2''n''); this choice is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;J_n=\begin{pmatrix}0 &amp;I_n \\ -I_n &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.
*CI: ''S''=''iI'' in U(''n'') ⊂ Sp(''n'') = Sp(''n'','''C''') ∩ U(2''n''); this choice is equivalent to ''J''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
*BDI: &lt;math&gt;S=\begin{pmatrix}I_p &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; -I_2\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; in SO(''p'')×SO(2).

The maximal parabolic subgroup ''P'' can be described explicitly in these classical cases. For AIII

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{P(p,q)= \begin{pmatrix}A_{pp} &amp; B_{pq}\\ 0 &amp; D_{qq}\end{pmatrix}}&lt;/math&gt;

in SL(''p''+''q'','''C'''). ''P''(''p'',''q'') is the stabilizer of a subspace of dimension ''p'' in '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''p''+''q''&lt;/sup&gt;.

The other groups arise as fixed points of involutions. Let ''J'' be the ''n'' × ''n'' matrix with 1's on the antidiagonal and 0's elsewhere and set

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{A=\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; J\\ -J &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Then Sp(''n'','''C''') is the fixed point subgroup of the involution θ(''g'') = ''A'' (''g''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''A''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of SL(2''n'','''C'''). SO(''n'','''C''') can be realised as the fixed points of ψ(''g'') = ''B'' (''g''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; ''B''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; in SL(''n'','''C''') where ''B'' = ''J''. These involutions leave invariant ''P''(''n'',''n'') in the cases DIII and CI and ''P''(''p'',2) in the case BDI. The corresponding parabolic subgroups ''P'' are obtained by taking the fixed points. The compact group ''H'' acts transitively on ''G'' / ''P'', so that ''G'' / ''P'' = ''H'' / ''K''.

==Hermitian symmetric spaces of noncompact type==

===Definition===
As with symmetric spaces in general, each compact Hermitian symmetric space ''H''/''K'' has a noncompact dual ''H''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;/''K'' obtained by replacing ''H'' with the closed real Lie subgroup ''H''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; of the complex Lie group ''G'' with Lie algebra
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak h^* = \mathfrak k \oplus i\mathfrak m\subset\mathfrak g.&lt;/math&gt;

===Borel embedding===
Whereas the natural map from ''H''/''K'' to ''G''/''P'' is an isomorphism, the natural map from ''H''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;/''K'' to ''G''/''P'' is only an inclusion onto an open subset. This inclusion is called the '''Borel embedding''' after [[Armand Borel]]. In fact ''P'' ∩ ''H'' = ''K'' = ''P'' ∩ ''H''*. The images of ''H'' and ''H''* have the same dimension so are open. Since the image of ''H'' is compact, so closed, it follows that ''H''/''K'' = ''G''/''P''.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Borel|1952}}
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cartan decomposition===
The polar decomposition in the complex linear group ''G'' implies the Cartan decomposition ''H''* = ''K'' ⋅ exp &lt;math&gt;i\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; in ''H''*.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dieudonné|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, given a maximal Abelian subalgebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; in t, ''A'' = exp  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; is a toral subgroup such that σ(''a'') = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; on ''A''; and any two such &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;'s are conjugate by an element of ''K''. A similar statement holds for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}^*=i\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;. Morevoer if ''A''* = exp &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}^*&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{H^*=KA^*K.}&lt;/math&gt;

These results are special cases of the Cartan decomposition in any Riemannian symmetric space and its dual. The geodesics emanating from the origin in the homogeneous spaces can be identified with one parameter groups with generators in  &lt;math&gt;i\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;. Similar results hold for in the compact case: ''H''= ''K'' ⋅ exp &lt;math&gt;i\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; and ''H'' = ''KAK''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb||Helgason|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The properties of the [[totally geodesic]] subspace ''A'' can be shown directly.  ''A'' is closed because the closure of ''A'' is a toral subgroup satisfying σ(''a'') = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, so its Lie algebra lies in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; and hence equals &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; by maximality. ''A'' can be generated topologically by a single element exp ''X'', so  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the centralizer of ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt;. In the ''K''-orbit of any element of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; there is an element ''Y'' such that (X,Ad ''k'' Y) is minimized at ''k'' = 1. Setting ''k'' = exp ''tT'' with ''T'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that (''X'',[''T'',''Y'']) = 0 and hence [''X'',''Y''] = 0, so that ''Y'' must lie in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the union of the conjugates of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular some conjugate of ''X'' lies in any other choice of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;, which centralizes that conjugate; so by maximality the only possibilities are conjugates of  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb||Helgason|1978|p=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decompositions

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{H=KAK,\,\,\,H = K\cdot \exp \mathfrak{m}}&lt;/math&gt;

can be proved directly by applying the [[slice theorem (differential geometry)|slice theorem]] for [[transformation group|compact transformation groups]] to the action of ''K'' on ''H'' / ''K''.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Duistermaat|Kolk|2000}}
*{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1981|pp=35–36}}
*{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1982|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the space ''H'' / ''K'' can be identified with

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{M=\{ \sigma(g)g^{-1}:g\in H\},}&lt;/math&gt;

a closed submanifold of ''H'', and the Cartan decomposition follows by showing that ''M'' is the union of the ''kAk''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; for ''k'' in ''K''. Since this union is the continuous image of ''K'' × ''A'', it is compact and connected. So it suffices to show that the union is open in ''M'' and for this it is enough to show each ''a'' in ''A'' has an open neighbourhood in this union. Now by computing derivatives at 0, the union contains an open neighbourhood of 1. If ''a'' is central the union is invariant under multiplication by ''a'', so contains an open neighbourhood of ''a''. If ''a'' is not central, write ''a'' = ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with ''b'' in ''A''. Then τ = Ad ''b'' −  Ad ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is a skew-adjoint operator on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; anticommuting with σ, which can be regarded as a '''Z'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-grading operator σ on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;. By an [[Euler–Poincaré characteristic]] argument it follows that the superdimension of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the superdimension of the kernel of τ. In other words,

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathrm{dim} \,\mathfrak{k} - \mathrm{dim} \,\mathfrak{k}_a = \mathrm{dim} \,\mathfrak{m} - \mathrm{dim} \,\mathfrak{m}_a,}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_a&lt;/math&gt; are the subspaces fixed by Ad ''a''. Let the orthogonal complement of  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_a^\perp&lt;/math&gt;. Computing derivstives it follows that Ad ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; (''a'' ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''Y''&lt;/sup&gt;), where ''X'' lies in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_a^\perp&lt;/math&gt; and ''Y'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_a&lt;/math&gt;, is an open neighbourhood of ''a'' in the union. Here the terms ''a'' ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''Y''&lt;/sup&gt; lie in the union by the argument for central ''a'': indeed ''a'' is in the center of the identity component of the centralizer of ''a'' which is invariant under σ and contains ''A''.

The dimension of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''rank''' of the Hermitian symmetric space.

===Strongly orthogonal roots===
In the case of Hermitian symmetric spaces, Harish-Chandra gave a canonical choice for &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;. 
This choice of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; is determined by taking a maximal torus ''T'' of ''H'' in ''K'' with Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the symmetry σ is implemented by an element of ''T'' lying in the centre of ''H'', the root spaces &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; are left invariant by σ. It acts as the identity on those contained in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_{\mathbb{C}}&lt;/math&gt; and minus the identity on those in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_{\mathbb{C}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The roots with root spaces in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}_{\mathbb{C}}&lt;/math&gt; 
are called '''compact roots''' and those with root spaces in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_{\mathbb{C}}&lt;/math&gt; are called '''noncompact roots'''. (This terminology originates from the symmetric space of noncompact type.)   If ''H'' is simple, the generator ''Z'' of the centre of ''K'' can be used to define a set of positive roots, according to the sign of α(''Z''). With this choice of roots  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt; are the direct sum of the root spaces &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; over positive and negative noncompact roots α. Root vectors ''E''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; can be chosen so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{X_\alpha=E_\alpha + E_{-\alpha}, \,\,\, Y_\alpha=i(E_\alpha - E_{-\alpha})}&lt;/math&gt;

lie in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt;. The simple roots α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...., α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are the indecomposable positive roots. These can be numbered so that  α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; vanishes on the center of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{h}&lt;/math&gt; for ''i'', whereas α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; does not. Thus α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the unique noncompact simple root and the other simple roots are compact. Any positive noncompact root then has the form β = α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ⋅⋅⋅ +  ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; α&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with non-negative coefficients ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. These corfficients lead to a [[lexicographic order]] on positive roots. The coefficient of α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is always one because &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible for ''K'' so is spanned by vectors obtained by successively applying the lowering operators ''E''&lt;sub&gt;–α&lt;/sub&gt; for simple compact roots α.

Two roots α and β are said to be '''strongly orthogonal''' if  ±α ±β are not roots or zero, written  α ≐ β. The highest positive root ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is noncompact. Take ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be the highest noncompact positive root strongly orthogonal to ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (for the lexicographic order). Then continue in this way taking ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt; to be the highest noncompact positive root strongly orthogonal to ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; until the process terminates. The corresponding vectors

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{X_i= E_{\psi_i} + E_{-\psi_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

lie in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; and commute by strong orthogonality. Their span &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; is Harish-Chandra's canonical maximal Abelian subalgebra.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=375–387}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972}}
*{{harvnb|Mok|1989|pp=88–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; (As Sugiura later showed, having fixed ''T'', the set of strongly orthogonal roots is uniquely determined up to applying an element in the Weyl group of ''K''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agaoka|Kaneda|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Maximality can be checked by showing that if

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{[\sum c_\alpha E_\alpha + \overline{c_\alpha}E_{-\alpha}, E_{\psi_i} + E_{-\psi_i}]=0}&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''i'', then ''c''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 for all positive noncompact roots α  different from the ψ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;'s. This follows by showing inductively that if ''c''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0, then α is strongly orthogonal to ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ψ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... a contradiction. Indeed, the above relation shows ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; + α cannot be a root; and that if ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; – α is a root, then it would necessarily have the form β – ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. If ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; – α were negative, then α would be a higher positive root than  ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, strongly orthogonal to the ψ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''j'' &lt; ''i'', which is not possible; similarly if  β – ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; were positive.

===Polysphere and polydisk theorem===
Harish-Chandra's canonical choice of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; leads to a polydisk and polysphere theorem in ''H''*/''K'' and ''H''/''K''. This result reduces the geometry to products of the prototypic example  involving SL(2,'''C'''), SU(1,1) and SU(2), namely the unit disk inside the Riemann sphere.

In the case of ''H'' = SU(2) the symmetry σ is given by conjugation by the diagonal matrix with entries ±''i'' so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\sigma\begin{pmatrix} \alpha &amp; \beta\\ -\overline{\beta} &amp; \overline{\alpha}\end{pmatrix} = 
\begin{pmatrix} \alpha &amp; -\beta\\ \overline{\beta} &amp; \overline{\alpha}\end{pmatrix}}&lt;/math&gt;

The fixed point subgroup is the maximal torus ''T'', the diagonal matrices with entries ''e''&lt;sup&gt; ±''it''&lt;/sup&gt;. SU(2) acts on the Riemann sphere &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{CP}^1&lt;/math&gt; transitively by Möbius transformations and ''T'' is the stabilizer of 0. SL(2,'''C'''), the complexification of SU(2), also acts by Möbius transformations and the stabiliser of 0 is the subgroup ''B'' of lower triangular matrices. The noncompact subgroup SU(1,1) acts with precisely three orbits: the open unit disk |''z''| &lt; 1; the unit circle ''z'' = 1; and its exterior |''z''| &gt; 1. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathrm{SU}(1,1)/\mathbf{T} = \{z: |z|&lt;1\} \,\,\, \subset \,\,\, B_+/\mathbf{T}_{\mathbb{C}} = \mathbb{C}\,\,\, \subset \,\,\,\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})/B = \mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\},}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''B''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;  and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the subgroups of upper triangular and diagonal matrices in SL(2,'''C'''). The middle term is the orbit of 0 under the upper unitriangular matrices

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; z\\ 0 &amp; 1\end{pmatrix} =\exp \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; z\\ 0 &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Now for each root ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; there is a homomorphism of π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of SU(2) into ''H'' which is compatible with the symmetries. It extends uniquely to a homomorphism of SL(2,'''C''') into ''G''. The images of the Lie algebras for different ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s since they are strongly orthogonal. Thus there is a homomorphism π of the direct product SU(2)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; into ''H'' compatible with the symmetries. It extends to a homomorphism of SL(2,'''C''')&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; into ''G''. The kernel of π is contained in the center (±1)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; of SU(2)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; which is fixed pointwise by the symmetry. So the image of the center under π lies in ''K''. Thus there is an embedding of the polysphere (SU(2)/T)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; into ''H'' / ''K'' = ''G'' / ''P'' and the polysphere contains the polydisk (SU(1,1)/T)&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;. The polysphere and polydisk are the direct product of ''r'' copies of the Riemann sphere and the unit disk. By the Cartan decompositions in SU(2) and SU(1,1), 
the polysphere is the orbit of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''A'' in ''H'' / ''K'' and the polydisk is the orbit of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;''A''*, where ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = π('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;) ⊆ ''K''. On the other hand, ''H'' = ''KAK'' and ''H''* = ''K'' ''A''* ''K''.

Hence every element in the compact Hermitian symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is in the ''K''-orbit of a point in the polysphere; and every element in the image  under the Borel embedding of the noncompact Hermitian symmetric space ''H''* / ''K'' is in the ''K''-orbit of a point in the polydisk.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972}}
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}
&amp;{{harvnb|Mok|1989|pp=88–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harish-Chandra embedding===
''H''* / ''K'', the  Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type, lies in the image of &lt;math&gt;\exp \mathfrak m_+&lt;/math&gt;, a dense open subset of ''H'' / ''K'' biholomorphic to  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m_+&lt;/math&gt;. The corresponding domain in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak m_+&lt;/math&gt; is bounded. This is the '''Harish-Chandra embedding''' named after [[Harish-Chandra]]. 
 
In fact Harish-Chandra showed the following properties of the space &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}=\exp (\mathfrak{m}_+)\cdot K_{\mathbb{C}} \cdot \exp(\mathfrak{m}_-)=\exp (\mathfrak{m}_+)\cdot P&lt;/math&gt;:

# As a space, '''X''' is the direct product of the three factors.
# '''X''' is open in ''G''.
# '''X''' is dense in ''G''.
# '''X''' contains ''H''*.
# The closure of ''H''* / ''K'' in '''X''' / ''P'' = &lt;math&gt;\exp \mathfrak{m}_+ &lt;/math&gt; is compact.

In fact &lt;math&gt;M_\pm=\exp \mathfrak{m}_\pm&lt;/math&gt; are complex Abelian groups normalised by ''K''&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;[\mathfrak{m}_+,\mathfrak{m}_-] \subset \mathfrak{k}_{\mathfrak{C}}&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;[\mathfrak{m},\mathfrak{m}] \subset \mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

This implies ''P'' ∩ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; = {1}. For if ''x'' = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; with ''X'' in 
&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_+&lt;/math&gt; lies in ''P'', it must normalize ''M''&lt;sub&gt;−&lt;/sub&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt;. But if ''Y'' lies in  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{Y=\mathrm{Ad}(X)\cdot Y= Y + [X,Y] + {1\over 2} [X,[X,Y]]\in \mathfrak{m}_+ \oplus \mathfrak{k}_{\mathbb{C}} \oplus \mathfrak{m}_-,}&lt;/math&gt;

so that ''X'' commutes with &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_-&lt;/math&gt;. But if ''X'' commutes with every noncompact root space, it must be 0, so ''x'' = 1. It follows that the multiplication map μ on ''M''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; × ''P'' is injective so (1) follows. Similarly the derivative of μ at (''x'',''p'') is

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mu^\prime(X,Y)=\mathrm{Ad}(p^{-1})X + Y =\mathrm{Ad}(p^{-1})(X\oplus\mathrm{Ad}(p)Y),}&lt;/math&gt;

which is injective, so (2) follows. For the special case ''H'' = SU(2), ''H''* = SU(1,1) and ''G'' = SL(2,'''C''') the remaining assertions are consequences of the identification with the Riemann sphere, '''C''' and unit disk. They can be applied to the groups defined for each root ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. By the polysphere and polydisk theorem ''H''*/''K'', '''X'''/''P'' and ''H''/''K'' are the union of the ''K''-translates of the polydisk, '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; and the polysphere. So ''H''* lies in '''X''', the closure of ''H''*/''K'' is compact in '''X'''/''P'', which is in turn dense in ''H''/''K''.

Note that (2) and (3) are also consequences of the fact that the image of ''X'' in ''G''/''P'' is that of the big cell ''B''&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt;''B'' in the [[Complexification (Lie group)#Gauss decomposition|Gauss decomposition]] of ''G''.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=382–396}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|p=281}}
*{{harvnb|Mok|1989}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Using results on the [[restricted root system]] of the symmetric spaces ''H''/''K'' and ''H''*/''K'', 
[[Robert Hermann (mathematician)|Hermann]] showed that the image of ''H''*/''K'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_+&lt;/math&gt; is a generalized unit disk. In fact it is the [[convex set]] of ''X'' for which the [[operator norm]] of ad Im ''X'' is less than one.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|pp=284–286}}
*{{harvnb|Mok|1989|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bounded symmetric domains===
A bounded domain ''&amp;Omega;'' in a complex vector space is said to be a '''bounded symmetric domain''' if for every ''x'' in ''&amp;Omega;'', there is an involutive biholomorphism ''&amp;sigma;''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''&amp;Omega;'' for which ''x'' is an isolated fixed point. The Harish-Chandra embedding exhibits every Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type ''H''* / ''K'' as a bounded symmetric domain. The biholomorphism group of ''H''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; / ''K'' is equal to its isometry group ''H''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.

Conversely every bounded symmetric domain arises in this way. Indeed, given a bounded symmetric domain ''&amp;Omega;'', the [[Bergman kernel]] defines a [[Riemannian metric|metric]] on ''&amp;Omega;'', the [[Bergman metric]], for which every biholomorphism is an isometry. This realizes ''&amp;Omega;'' as a Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}
*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972}}
*{{harvnb|Mok|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{g(Z)=(AZ+B)(CZ+D)^{-1}.}&lt;/math&gt;

The polydisk theorem takes the following concrete form in the classical cases:&lt;ref&gt;See:

* '''Type I'''&lt;sub&gt;'''''pq'''''&lt;/sub&gt; (''p'' ≤ ''q''): for every ''p'' × ''q'' matrix ''M'' there are unitary matrices such that ''UMV'' is diagonal. In fact this follows from the [[polar decomposition]] for ''p'' × ''p'' matrices.
* '''Type III'''&lt;sub&gt;'''''n'''''&lt;/sub&gt;: for every complex symmetric ''n'' × ''n'' matrix ''M'' there is a unitary matrix ''U'' such that ''UMU''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; is diagonal. This is proved by a classical argument of [[Carl Ludwig Siegel|Siegel]]. Take ''V'' unitary so that ''V''*''M''*''MV'' is diagonal. Then ''V''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;''MV'' is symmetric and its real and imaginary parts commute. Since they are real symmetric matrices they can be simultaneously diagonalized by a real orthogonal matrix ''W''. So ''UMU''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; is diagonal if ''U'' = ''WV''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt;.
* '''Type II'''&lt;sub&gt;'''''n'''''&lt;/sub&gt;: for every complex skew symmetric ''n'' × ''n'' matrix ''M'' there is a unitary matrix such that ''UMU''&lt;sup&gt;''t''&lt;/sup&gt; is made up of diagonal blocks &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; a\\ -a &amp; 0\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; and one zero if ''n'' is odd. As in Siegel's artgument, this can be reduced to case where the real and imaginary parts of ''M'' commute. Any real skew-symmetric matrix can be reduced to the given [[Skew-symmetric matrix#Spectral theory|canonical form]] by an orthogonal matrix and this can be done simultaneously for commuting matrices.
* '''Type IV'''&lt;sub&gt;'''''n'''''&lt;/sub&gt;: by a transformation in SO(''n'') × SO(2) any vector can be transformed so that all but the first two coordinates are non-zero.

===Boundary components===
The noncompact group ''H''* acts on the complex Hermitian symmetric space ''H''/''K'' = ''G''/''P'' with only finitely many orbits. The orbit structure is described in detail in {{harvtxt|Wolf|1972}}. In particular the closure of the bounded domain ''H''*/''K'' has a unique closed orbit, which is the [[Shilov boundary]] of the domain. In general the orbits are unions of Hermitian symmetric spaces of lower dimension. The complex function theory of the domains, in particular the analogue of the [[Cauchy integral formula]]s, are described for the Cartan domains in {{harvtxt|Hua|1979}}. The closure of the bounded domain is the [[Baily–Borel compactification]] of ''H''*/''K''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borel|Ji|2006|pp=77–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundary structure can be described using [[Cayley transform]]s. For each copy of SU(2) defined by one of the noncompact roots ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a Cayley transform ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; which as a Möbius transformation maps the unit disk onto the upper half plane. Given a subset ''I'' of indices of the strongly orthogonal family ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ψ&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;, the ''partial Cayley transform'' ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as the product of the ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s with ''i'' in ''I'' in the product of the groups π&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''G''(''I'') be the centralizer of this product in ''G'' and ''H''*(''I'') = ''H''* ∩ ''G''(''I''). Since σ leaves ''H''*(''I'') invariant, there is a corresponding Hermitian symmetric space ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; ''H''*(''I'')/''H''*(''I'')∩''K'' ⊂ ''H''*/''K'' = ''M'' . The boundary component for the subset ''I'' is the union of the ''K''-translates of ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt;. When ''I'' is the set of all indices, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is a single point and the boundary component is the Shilov boundary. Moreover, ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''I''&lt;/sub&gt; is in the closure of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''J''&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if ''I'' ⊇ ''J''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|pp=286–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geometric properties==
Every Hermitian symmetric space is a [[Kähler manifold]]. They can be defined equivalently as Riemannian symmetric spaces with a parallel complex structure with respect to which the Riemannian metric is [[Hermitian metric|Hermitian]]. The complex structure is automatically preserved by the isometry group ''H'' of the metric, and so any Hermitian symmetric space ''M'' is a homogeneous complex manifold. Some examples are [[complex vector space]]s and [[complex projective space]]s, with their usual Hermitian metrics and [[Fubini–Study metric]]s, and the complex [[unit ball]]s with suitable metrics so that they become [[Complete metric space|complete]] and Riemannian symmetric. The [[compact space|compact]] Hermitian symmetric spaces are [[projective variety|projective varieties]], and admit a strictly larger [[Lie group]] ''G'' of [[biholomorphism]]s with respect to which they are homogeneous: in fact, they are [[generalized flag manifold]]s, i.e., ''G'' is [[semisimple Lie group|semisimple]] and the stabilizer of a point is a [[parabolic subgroup]] ''P'' of ''G''. Among (complex) generalized flag manifolds ''G''/''P'', they are characterized as those for which the [[Nilradical of a Lie algebra|nilradical]] of the Lie algebra of ''P'' is abelian. The non-compact Hermitian symmetric spaces can be realized as bounded [[domain (mathematics)|domains]] in complex vector spaces.

==Jordan algebras==
{{See also|Mutation (Jordan algebra)|Symmetric cone|Quadratic Jordan algebra}}
Although the classical Hermitian symmetric spaces can be constructed by ad hoc methods, [[Jordan triple system]]s, or equivalently Jordan pairs, provide a uniform algebraic means of describing all the basic properties connected with a Hermitian symmetric space of compact type and its non-compact dual. This theory is described in detail in {{harvtxt|Koecher|1969}} and {{harvtxt|Loos|1977}} and summarized in {{harvtxt|Satake|1981}}. The development is in the reverse order from that using the structure theory of compact Lie groups. It starting point is the Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type realized as a bounded symmetric domain. It can be described in terms of a [[Jordan pair]] or hermitian [[Jordan triple system]]. This Jordan algebra structure can be used to reconstruct the dual Hermitian symmetric space of compact type, including in particular all the associated Lie algebras and Lie groups.

The theory is easiest to describe when the irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric space is of tube type. In that case the space is determined by a simple real Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;
with negative definite Killing form. It must admit an action of SU(2) which only acts via the trivial and adjoint representation, both types occurring. Since &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; is simple, this action is inner, so implemented by an inclusion of the Lie algebra of SU(2) in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;. The complexification of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; decomposes as a direct sum of three eigenspaces for the diagonal matrices in SU(2). It is a three-graded complex Lie algebra, with the Weyl group element of SU(2) providing the involution. Each of the ±1 eigenspaces has the structure of a unital complex Jordan algebra explicitly arising as the complexification of a Euclidean Jordan algebra. It can be identified with the multiplicity space of the adjoint representation  of SU(2) in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;.

The description of irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type starts from a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra ''E''. It admits [[Jordan frame (Jordan algebra)|Jordan frames]], i.e. sets of orthogonal minimal idempotents ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''1''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;. Any two are related by an automorphism of ''E'', so that the integer ''m'' is an invariant called the '''rank''' of ''E''. Moreover, if ''A'' is the complexification of ''E'', it has a unitary [[structure group (Jordan algebra)|structure group]]. It is a subgroup of GL(''A'') preserving the natural complex inner product on ''A''. Any element ''a'' in ''A'' has a polar decomposition {{math|1=''a'' = ''u'' ∑ α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with  {{math|1=α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0}}. The spectral norm is defined by ||a|| = sup α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The associated [[bounded symmetric domain]] is just the open unit ball ''D'' in ''A''. There is a biholomorphism between ''D'' and the tube domain ''T'' = ''E'' + ''iC'' where ''C'' is the open self-dual convex cone of elements in ''E'' of the form {{math|1=''a'' = ''u'' ∑ α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with ''u'' an automorphism of ''E'' and α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0. This gives two descriptions of the Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type. There is a natural way of using [[mutation (Jordan algebra)|mutations]] of the Jordan algebra ''A'' to compactify the space ''A''. The compactification ''X'' is a complex manifold and the finite-dimensional Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; of holomorphic vector fields on ''X'' can be determined explicitly. One parameter groups of biholomorphisms can be defined such that the corresponding holomorphic vector fields span &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;. This includes the group of all complex Möbius transformations corresponding to matrices in SL(2,'''C'''). The subgroup SU(1,1) leaves invariant the unit ball and its closure. The subgroup SL(2,'''R''') leaves invariant the tube domain and its closure. The usual Cayley transform and its inverse, mapping the unit disk in '''C''' to the upper half plane, establishes analogous maps between ''D'' and ''T''. The polydisk corresponds to the real and complex Jordan subalgebras generated by a fixed Jordan frame. It admits a transitive action of SU(2)&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; and this action extends to ''X''. The group ''G'' generated by the one-parameter groups of biholomorphisms acts faithfully on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;. The subgroup generated by the identity component ''K'' of the unitary structure group and the operators in SU(2)&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;. It defines a compact Lie group ''H'' which acts transitively on ''X''. Thus ''H'' / ''K'' is the corresponding Hermitian symmetric space of compact type. The group ''G'' can be identified with the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] of ''H''. The subgroup ''H''* leaving ''D'' invariant is a  noncompact real form of ''G''. It acts transitively on ''D'' so that ''H''* / ''K'' is the dual Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type. The inclusions ''D'' ⊂ ''A'' ⊂ ''X'' reproduce the Borel and Harish-Chandra embeddings. The classification of Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type reduces to that of simple Euclidean Jordan algebras. These were classified by {{harvtxt|Jordan|von Neumann|Wigner|1934}} in terms of [[Euclidean Hurwitz algebra]]s, a special type of [[composition algebra]].

In general a Hermitian symmetric space gives rise to a 3-graded Lie algebra with a period 2 conjugate linear automorphism switching the parts of degree ±1 and preserving the degree 0 part. This gives rise to the structure of a [[Jordan pair]] or hermitian [[Jordan triple system]], to which {{harvtxt|Loos|1977}} extended the theory of Jordan algebras. All irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces can be constructed uniformly within this framework. {{harvtxt|Koecher|1969}} constructed the irreducible Hermitian symmetric space of non-tube type from a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra together with a period 2 automorphism. The −1 eigenspace of the automorphism has the structure of a Jordan pair, which can be deduced from that of the larger Jordan algebra. In the non-tube type case corresponding to a [[Siegel domain]] of type II, there is no distinguished subgroup of real or complex Möbius transformations. For irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces, tube type is characterized by the real dimension of the Shilov boundary {{math|''S''}} being equal to the complex dimension of {{math|''D''}}.

== Four principles ==
''How to Solve It'' suggests the following steps when solving a [[mathematical problem]]:
# First, you have to ''[[understanding|understand]] the [[problem]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} pp.6-8&lt;/ref&gt;
# After understanding, ''[[plan|make a plan]]''.&lt;ref name="Pólya 1957"&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} pp.8-12&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Carry out the plan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} pp.12-14&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''[[Review|Look back]]'' on your work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} pp.14-15&lt;/ref&gt; [[scientific method|How could it be better]]?

If this technique fails, Pólya advises:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p114&lt;/ref&gt;  "If you can't solve a problem, then there is an easier problem you can solve: find it." Or: "If you cannot solve the proposed problem, try to solve first some related problem. Could you imagine a more accessible related problem?"

=== First principle: Understand the problem ===

"Understand the problem" is often neglected as being obvious and is not even mentioned in many mathematics classes. Yet students are often stymied in their efforts to solve it, simply because they don't understand it fully, or even in part. In order to remedy this oversight, Pólya taught teachers how to prompt each student with appropriate questions,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p33&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the situation, such as:

* What are you asked to find or show?&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p214&lt;/ref&gt;
* Can you restate the problem in your own words?
* Can you think of a picture or a diagram that might help you understand the problem?
* Is there enough information to enable you to find a solution?
* Do you understand all the words used in stating the problem?
* Do you need to ask a question to get the answer?

The teacher is to select the question with the appropriate level of difficulty for each student to ascertain if each student understands at their own level, moving up or down the list to prompt each student, until each one can respond with something constructive.

=== Second principle: Devise a plan ===

Pólya mentions that there are many reasonable ways to solve problems.&lt;ref name="Pólya 1957"/&gt; The skill at choosing an appropriate strategy is best learned by solving many problems. You will find choosing a strategy increasingly easy. A partial list of strategies is included:

* Guess and check&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p99&lt;/ref&gt;
* Make an orderly list&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p2&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eliminate possibilities&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p94&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use symmetry&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p199&lt;/ref&gt;
* Consider special cases&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p190&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use direct reasoning
* Solve an equation&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p172 Pólya advises teachers that asking students to immerse themselves in routine operations only, instead of enhancing their imaginative / judicious side is inexcusable.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also suggested:

* Look for a pattern&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p108&lt;/ref&gt;
* Draw a picture&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} pp103-108&lt;/ref&gt;
* Solve a simpler problem&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p114 Pólya notes that 'human superiority consists in going around an obstacle that cannot be overcome directly'&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use a model&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p105, p29-32, for example, Pólya discusses the problem of water flowing into a cone as an example of what is required to visualize the problem, using a figure.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Work backward&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p105, p225&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use a formula&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} pp141-148. Pólya describes the method of ''analysis''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Be creative&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p172 (Pólya advises that this requires that the student have the patience to wait until the bright idea appears (subconsciously).)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Applying these rules to devise a plan takes your own skill and judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} pp148-149. In the dictionary entry 'Pedantry &amp; mastery' Pólya cautions pedants to 'always use your own brains first'&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third principle: Carry out the plan ===

This step is usually easier than devising the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p.35&lt;/ref&gt; In general, all you need is care and patience, given that you have the necessary skills. Persist with the plan that you have chosen. If it continues not to work, discard it and choose another. Don't be misled; this is how mathematics is done, even by professionals.

=== Fourth principle: Review/extend ===

Pólya mentions that much can be gained by taking the time to reflect and look back at what you have done, what worked and what didn't.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} p.36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} pp.14-19&lt;/ref&gt; Doing this will enable you to predict what strategy to use to solve future problems, if these relate to the original problem.

== Heuristics ==
The book contains a dictionary-style set of [[heuristics]], many of which have to do with generating a more accessible problem. For example:

In [[economics]] and [[finance]], an '''intertemporal budget constraint''' is a [[constrained optimization|constraint]] faced by a [[decision theory|decision maker]] who is making choices for both the present and the future. In its general form it says that the [[present value]] of current and future cash outflows cannot exceed the present value of currently available funds and future cash inflows. Typically this is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{t=0}^T \frac{x_t}{(1+r)^t}  \le \sum_{t=0}^T \frac{w_t}{(1+r)^t} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x_t &lt;/math&gt; is expenditure at time ''t'', &lt;math&gt;w_t&lt;/math&gt; is the cash that becomes available at time ''t'', ''T'' is the most distant relevant time period, 0 is the current time period, and &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+r}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[discount factor]] computed from the interest rate ''r''.

Complications are possible in various circumstances. For example, the [[interest rate]] for discounting cash receipts might be greater than the interest rate for discounting expenditures, because future inflows may be borrowed against while currently available funds may be invested temporarily pending use for future expenditures, and borrowing rates may exceed [[investment return]]s.

==Applications==

In most applications, the entire budget would be used up, because any unspent funds would represent unobtained potential utility. In these situations, the intertemporal budget constraint is effectively an equality constraint.

In an [[intertemporal consumption]]  model, the sum of utilities from expenditures made at various times in the future, these [[discounted utility|utilities discounted back to the present]] at the consumer's rate of [[time preference]], would be maximized with respect to the amounts ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; consumed in each period, subject to an intertemporal budget constraint.

In a model of [[intertemporal portfolio choice]], the objective would be to maximize the [[expected value]] or [[expected utility]] of final period wealth. Since investment returns in each period generally would not be known in advance, the constraint effectively imposes a limit on the amount that can be invested in the final period&amp;mdash;namely, whatever the wealth accumulated as of the end of the next-to-last period is.

Rumbaugh''' (born August 22, 1947) is an American [[computer scientist]] and [[object-oriented]] methodologist&lt;ref name="InformIT"&gt;[http://www.informit.com/authors/bio.aspx?a=d3dd9437-09e2-448f-9ee3-6aad01752522 Biography on InformIT] Accessed 22 Jan 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; who is best known for his work in creating the [[Object-modeling technique|Object Modeling Technique]] (OMT) and the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML).

== Biography ==
Born in [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]], Rumbaugh received a B.S. in [[physics]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), an M.S. in [[astronomy]] from the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[computer science]] from MIT under Professor [[Jack Dennis]].&lt;ref name="InformIT"/&gt;

Rumbaugh started his career in the 1960s at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) as a lead research scientist. From 1968 to 1994 he worked at the [[General Electric]] Research and Development Center developing technology, teaching, and consulting. At General Electric he also led the development of [[Object-modeling technique]] (OMT), an object modeling language for software modeling and designing.

In 1994, he joined [[Rational Software]], where he worked with [[Ivar Jacobson]] and [[Grady Booch]] ("the Three Amigos") to develop [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML). Later they merged their software development methologies, OMT, [[Object-oriented software engineering|OOSE]] and [[Booch method|Booch]] into the [[Rational Unified Process]] (RUP). In 2003 he moved to [[IBM]], after its acquisition of Rational Software. He retired in 2006.&lt;ref name="InformIT"/&gt;

He has two grown up sons and (in 2009) lived in [[Saratoga, California]] with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yB1WwURwBUQC&amp;pg=PA454&amp;lpg=PA454&amp;dq=%22James+Rumbaugh%22+saratoga&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-DWF8DlliB&amp;sig=3sw7xNHr3qPaVpWZwg7VGE4RPcs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju85_Uj-_QAhXDQiYKHeRUAJkQ6AEIQzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22James%20Rumbaugh%22%20saratoga&amp;f=false Masterminds of Programming: Conversations with the Creators of Major ... - Federico Biancuzzi, Chromatic - Google Books] Retrieved 2016-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Rumbaugh's main research interests are formal description languages, "semantics of computation, tools for programming productivity, and applications using complex algorithms and data structures".&lt;ref name="InformIT"/&gt;

In his graduate work at MIT, Rumbaugh contributed to the development of [[Dataflow architecture|data flow computer architecture]]. His thesis described [[parallel programming language]], [[Parallel computing|parallel processor computer]] and a basis for a network architecture, which orients itself at data flow.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Rumbaugh (1975) ''A Parallel Asynchronous Computer Architecture For Data Flow Programs''.&lt;/ref&gt; Rumbaugh made further contributions to [[Object Modeling Technique]], [[IDEF4]], the [[Rational Unified Process]] and [[Unified Modeling Language]].

== Publications ==
Rumbaugh has written a number of books about UML and RUP together with [[Ivar Jacobson]] and [[Grady Booch]]. A selection includes:

* 1975. ''A Parallel Asynchronous Computer Architecture For Data Flow Programs''. MIT thesis 
* 1991. ''Object-Oriented Modeling and Design''. With others. [[Prentice Hall]], {{ISBN|0-13-629841-9}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="986">In [[cryptography]], the '''key-recovery advantage''' ('''KR advantage''') of a particular [[algorithm]] is a measure of how effective an algorithm can mount a [[key-recovery attack]]. Consequently, the maximum key-recovery advantage attainable by any algorithm with a fixed amount of [[computational resources]] is a measure of how difficult it is to recover a [[Cipher|cipher's]] key. It is defined as the probability that the adversary algorithm can guess a cipher's randomly selected key, given a fixed amount of computational resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shafi Goldwasser|Goldwasser, S.]] and Bellare, M.

}}'''L'association femmes et mathématiques''' (in English: Association of Women and Mathematics), created in 1987,&lt;ref name= Noussommes1&gt;Official Association Website Nous Sommes, or About, page&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[voluntary association]] promoting women in scientific studies and research in general, and mathematics in particular. This organization currently has about 200 members, including university professors of math, math teachers, sociologists, philosophers and historians that are interested in the "woman question" in scientific domains.&lt;ref name= Noussommes1 /&gt;

According to its mandate, its principle objectives are:

* To act for the promotion of women in the scientific sphere and more specifically mathematics.
* To encourage the presence of women in mathematical studies and more generally scientific and technical studies.
* To be a place for meetings between mathematicians and teachers of mathematics.
*Make the scientific and pedagogic community aware of the question of equality between men and women.&lt;ref name= Noussommes1 /&gt;
*To rally for equal representation, or parity, of women within mathematical jobs and the increase of recruitment of female math students at university.&lt;ref name= Noussommes1 /&gt;

It specifically organizes a forum of young women mathematicians, as well as conferences on different topics related to its objectives. They hold regularly a general assembly, either in Paris or outside of the city, based on various themes.&lt;ref name= Noussommes1 /&gt; It also publishes an academic journal.

The association has its headquarters at the Maison des mathématiciens at l'Institut Henri Poincaré in [[Paris]]. It participates in different initiatives with other scholarly and professional societies, in particular the [[Société Mathématique de France]](Mathematical Society of France), la Société de mathématiques appliquées et industrielles (Society of Applied and Industrial Maths), l'Association des professeurs de mathématiques de l'enseignement public (Association of Math Professors and Public Teachers) and l'Union des professeurs de spéciales.

Board of the Association for 2013:
*President: [[Laurence Broze]]&lt;ref name= Noussommes1 /&gt;
*Vice-president: [[Véronique Slovacek-Chauveau]]&lt;ref name= Noussommes1 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2468">'''Ludwig Ernst Hans Burmester''' (5 May 1840 – 20 April 1927) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Kinematics|kinematician]] and [[geometer]].

His doctoral thesis ''Über die Elemente einer Theorie der Isophoten'' (About the elements of a theory of isophotes) concerned lines on a surface defined by light direction. After a period as a teacher in [[Łódź]] he became professor of synthetic geometry at [[Dresden]] where his growing interest in kinematics culminated in his ''Lehrbuch der Kinematik, Erster Band, Die ebene Bewegung'' (Textbook of Kinematics, First Volume, Planar Motion) of 1888, developing the approach to the theory of [[linkage (mechanical)|linkage]]s introduced by [[Franz Reuleaux]], whereby a planar mechanism was understood as a collection of Euclidean planes in relative motion with one [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]]. Burmester considered both the theory of planar kinematics and practically all actual mechanisms known in his time. In doing so, Burmester developed [[Burmester theory]] which applies [[projective geometry]] to the loci of points on planes moving in straight lines and in circles, where any motion may be understood in relation to four Burmester points.&lt;ref&gt;Ceccarelli and Koetsier, ''Burmester and Allevi: A Theory and its Application for Mechanism Design at the end of 19th Century, Proceedings of IDETC/CIE 2006 ASME 2006 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences &amp; Computers and Information in Engineering Conference'' [http://webuser.unicas.it/weblarm/file%20pdf/327-burmester&amp;allieviDETC2006-99165.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burmester linkage of 1888 is a four bar linkage part of whose coupler curve is an approximately straight line (see also [[Watt's linkage]]).

A [[French curve]] may also be known as a Burmester curve.

Problems of name collision, and methods to avoid them, are a common issue in an introductory level analysis of computer languages, such as for [[C++]].&lt;ref name=CBro/&gt;

==History==
The term "name collision" has been used in computer science for more than three decades, when referring to names in various classification systems.&lt;ref name="ACMP"&gt;
  "Name collision in multiple classification hierarchies",
  Portal ACM ([[Association for Computing Machinery]]),
  by J.L. Knudsen, 1988, webpage:
  [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=60607 Portal-ACM-607].
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avoiding name collisions==
There are several techniques for avoiding name collisions, including the use of:
* ''[[namespace]]s'' - to qualify each name within a separate name group, so that the totally qualified names differ from each other.&lt;ref name=CBro/&gt;
* ''renaming'' - to change the name of one item (typically the one used less often) into some other name.
* ''prefixing'' - putting unique characters before the names so that the names differ and further name collisions are unlikely to happen by accident.
Those are some of the tactics used to resolve the name collisions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8495">The '''napkin folding problem''' is a problem in [[geometry]] and the [[mathematics of paper folding]] that explores whether folding a [[Square (geometry)|square]] or a [[Rectangle|rectangular]] [[napkin]] can increase its [[perimeter]]. The problem is known under several names, including the '''Margulis napkin problem''', suggesting it is due to [[Grigory Margulis]], and the '''Arnold's rouble problem''' referring to [[Vladimir Arnold]] and the folding of a [[Russian ruble]] bank note. Some versions of the problem were solved by [[Robert J. Lang]], [[Svetlana Krat]], [[Alexey S. Tarasov]], and [[Ivan Yaschenko]]. One form of the problem remains open.

== Formulations ==
There are several way to define the notion of [[Paper folding|folding]], giving different interpretations. By convention, the napkin is always a unit [[Square (geometry)|square]].

=== Folding along a straight line ===
Considering the folding as a reflection along a line that reflects all the layers of the napkin, the perimeter is always non-increasing, thus never exceeding 4.&lt;ref name=Arnold/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsgroup/&gt;

By considering more general foldings that possibly reflects only a single layer of the napkin (in this case, each folding is a reflection of a connected component of folded napkin on one side of a straight line), it still open if a sequence of these foldings can increase the perimeter.&lt;ref name=Petrunin/&gt; In other words, it still unknown if exists a solution that can be folded using some combination of mountain folds, valley folds, reverse folds, and/or sink folds (with all folds in the latter two cases being formed along a single line). Also unknown, of course, is whether such a fold would be possible using the more-restrictive [[pureland origami]].

=== Folding without stretching ===
One can ask for a realizable construction within the constraints of [[rigid origami]] where the napkin is never stretched whilst being folded. In 2004 A. Tarasov showed that such constructions can indeed be obtained. This can be considered a complete solution to the original problem.&lt;ref name="Tarasov" /&gt;

=== Where only the result matters ===
{{primary sources|date=January 2016}}

One can ask whether there exists a folded planar napkin (without regard as to how it was folded into that shape). 

[[Robert J. Lang]] showed in 1997&lt;ref name=newsgroup/&gt; that several classical [[origami]] constructions give rise to an easy solution.&lt;ref name=Lang/&gt; In fact, Lang showed that the perimeter can be made as large as desired by making the construction more complicated, while still resulting in a flat folded solution. However his constructions are not necessarily [[rigid origami]] because of their use of sink folds and related forms. Although no stretching is needed in sink and unsink folds, it is often (though not always) necessary to curve facets and/or sweep one or more creases continuously through the paper in intermediate steps before obtaining a flat result. Whether a general rigidly foldable solution exists based on sink folds is an open problem.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

In 1998, I. Yaschenko constructed a 3D folding with projection onto a plane which has a bigger perimeter.&lt;ref name=Yaschenko/&gt; This indicated to mathematicians that there was probably a flat folded solution to the problem.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The same conclusion was made by Svetlana Krat.&lt;ref&gt;S. Krat, Approximation Problems in Length Geometry, Ph.D. thesis, Pennsylvania State University, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Her approach is different, she gives very simple construction of a "rumpling" which increase perimeter and then proves that any "rumpling" can be arbitrarily well approximated by a "folding". In essence she shows that the precise details of the how to do the folds don't matter much if stretching is allowed in intermediate steps.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

== Solutions ==
===Lang's solutions===
[[File:Napkin folding problem Lang N 5.svg|thumb|150px|Crease pattern for Lang's sea urchin-like solution with ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5]]
Lang devised two different solutions.&lt;ref name=Lang/&gt;&lt;ref name=SeaLife/&gt; Both involved [[origami techniques|sinking]] flaps and so were not necessarily rigidly foldable. The simplest was based on the origami bird base and gave a solution with a perimeter of about 4.12 compared to the original perimeter of 4.

The second solution can be used to make a figure with a perimeter as large as desired. He divides the square into a large number of smaller squares and employs the '[[sea urchin]]' type origami construction described in his 1990 book, ''Origami Sea Life''.&lt;ref name=SeaLife/&gt; The crease pattern shown is the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 case and can be used to produce a flat figure with 25 flaps, one for each of the large circles, and sinking is used to thin them. When very thin the 25 arms will give a 25 pointed star with a small center and a perimeter approaching ''N''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(''N''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1). In the case of ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 this is about 6.25, and the total length goes up approximately as&amp;nbsp;''N''.

== History ==
Arnold states in his book that he formulated the problem in 1956, but the formulation was left intentionally vague.&lt;ref name=Arnold/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tabachnikov/&gt; He called it 'the rumpled rouble problem', and it was the first of many interesting problems he set at seminars in Moscow over 40 years. In the West, it became known as Margulis napkin problem after [[Jim Propp]]'s [[newsgroup]] posting in 1996.&lt;ref name=newsgroup/&gt; Despite attention, it received [[folklore]] status and its origin is often referred as "unknown".&lt;ref name=Yaschenko/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12543">In [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]], an '''ordinal notation''' is a partial function from the set of all finite sequences of symbols from a finite alphabet to a countable set of [[ordinal number|ordinals]], and a [[Gödel numbering]] is a function from the set of well-formed formulae (a well-formed formula is a finite sequence of symbols on which the ordinal notation function is defined) of some formal language to the natural numbers. This associates each wff with a unique natural number, called its Gödel number. If a Gödel numbering is fixed, then the subset relation on the ordinals induces an ordering on well-formed formulae which in turn induces a well-ordering on the subset of natural numbers. A '''recursive ordinal notation''' must satisfy the following two additional properties:

# the subset of natural numbers is a [[recursive set]]
# the induced well-ordering on the subset of natural numbers is a recursive relation

There are many such schemes of ordinal notations, including schemes by [[Wilhelm Ackermann]], [[Heinz Bachmann]], Wilfried Buchholz, [[Georg Cantor]], [[Solomon Feferman]], Gerhard Jäger, Isles, Pfeiffer,   Wolfram Pohlers, [[Kurt Schütte]], [[Gaisi Takeuti]] (called '''ordinal diagrams'''),  [[Oswald Veblen]]. [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] has a system of notations, called [[Kleene's O]], which includes ordinal notations but it is not as well behaved as the other systems described here.

Usually one proceeds by defining several functions from ordinals to ordinals and representing each such function by a symbol. In many systems, such as Veblen's well known system, the functions are normal functions, that is, they are strictly increasing and continuous in at least one of their arguments, and increasing in other arguments. Another desirable property for such functions is that the value of the function is greater than each of its arguments, so that an ordinal is always being described in terms of smaller ordinals. There are several such desirable properties. Unfortunately, no one system can have all of them since they contradict each other.

==A simplified example using a pairing function==
As usual, we must start off with a constant symbol for zero, "0", which we may consider to be a function of [[arity]] zero. This is necessary because there are no smaller ordinals in terms of which zero can be described.  The most obvious next step would be to define a unary function, "S", which takes an ordinal to the smallest ordinal greater than it; in other words, S is the successor function. In combination with zero, successor allows one to name any natural number.

The third function might be defined as one that maps each ordinal to the smallest ordinal that cannot yet be described with the above two functions and previous values of this function. This would map β to ω&amp;middot;β except when β is a fixed point of that function plus a finite number in which case one uses ω&amp;middot;(β+1).

The fourth function would map α to ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;middot;α except when α is a fixed point of that plus a finite number in which case one uses ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;middot;(α+1).

===&amp;xi;-notation===

One could continue in this way, but it would give us an infinite number of functions. So instead let us merge the unary functions together into a binary function. By [[transfinite recursion]] on α, we can use transfinite recursion on β to define ξ(α,β) = the smallest ordinal γ such that α &lt; γ and β &lt; γ and γ is not the value of ξ for any smaller α or for the same α with a smaller β.

Thus, define ξ-notations as follows:
*"0" is a ξ-notation for zero.
*If "A" and "B" are replaced by ξ-notations for &amp;alpha; and &amp;beta; in "ξAB", then the result is a ξ-notation for ξ(α,β).
*There are no other ξ-notations.

ξ is defined for all pairs of ordinals and is one-to-one.  It always gives values larger than its arguments and its [[Range (mathematics)|range]] is all ordinals other than 0 and the epsilon numbers (ε=ω&lt;sup&gt;ε&lt;/sup&gt;).

ξ(α,β)&lt;ξ(γ,δ) if and only if either (α=γ and β&lt;δ) or (α&lt;γ and β&lt;ξ(γ,δ)) or (α&gt;γ and ξ(α,β)≤δ).

With this definition, the first few &amp;xi;-notations are:
:"0" for 0. "ξ00" for 1. "ξ0ξ00" for ξ(0,1)=2. "ξξ000" for ξ(1,0)=ω. "ξ0ξ0ξ00" for 3. "ξ0ξξ000" for ω+1. "ξξ00ξ00" for ω&amp;middot;2. "ξξ0ξ000" for ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt;. "ξξξ0000" for &lt;math&gt;\omega^{\omega^{\omega}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In general, ξ(0,β) = β+1. While ξ(1+α,β) = ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;middot;(β+k) for k = 0 or 1 or 2 depending on special situations:&lt;br&gt;
k = 2 if α is an epsilon number and β is finite.&lt;br&gt;
Otherwise, k = 1 if β is a multiple of ω&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;sup&gt;α+1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; plus a finite number.&lt;br&gt;
Otherwise, k = 0.

The ξ-notations can be used to name any ordinal less than &amp;epsilon;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with an alphabet of only two symbols ("0" and "ξ"). If these notations are extended by adding functions that enumerate epsilon numbers, then they will be able to name any ordinal less than the first epsilon number that cannot be named by the added functions. This last property, adding symbols within an initial segment of the ordinals gives names within that segment, is called repleteness (after [[Solomon Feferman]]).

==Systems of ordinal notation==
There are many different systems for ordinal notation introduced by various authors. It is often quite hard to convert between the different systems.

===Cantor===
{{main|Cantor normal form}}
"Exponential polynomials" in 0 and &amp;omega; gives a system of ordinal notation for ordinals less than [[epsilon zero]]. There are many equivalent ways to write these; instead of exponential polynomials, one can use rooted trees, or nested parentheses, or the system described above.

===Veblen===
{{main|Veblen function}}
The 2-variable Veblen functions {{harv|Veblen|1908}} can be used to give a system of ordinal notation for ordinals less than the [[Feferman-Schutte ordinal]]. The Veblen functions in a finite or transfinite number of variables give systems of ordinal notations for ordinals less than the small and large [[Veblen ordinal (disambiguation)|Veblen ordinal]]s.

===Ackermann===
{{harvtxt|Ackermann|1951}} described a system of ordinal notation rather weaker than the system described earlier by Veblen. The limit of his system is sometimes called the [[Ackermann ordinal]].

===Bachmann===
{{harvtxt|Bachmann|1950}} introduced the key idea of using uncountable ordinals to produce new countable ordinals. His original system was rather cumbersome to use as it required choosing a special sequence converging to each ordinal. Later systems of notation introduced by Feferman and others avoided this complication.

===Takeuti (ordinal diagrams)===
{{harvtxt|Takeuti|1987}} described a very powerful system of ordinal notation called "ordinal diagrams", which is hard to understand but was later simplified by Feferman.

===Feferman's &amp;theta; functions===
Feferman introduced theta functions, described in {{harvtxt|Buchholz|1986}} as follows. 
The function for an ordinal &amp;alpha;, &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt; is a function from ordinals to ordinals. 
Often &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;alpha;&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;beta;) is written as &amp;theta;&amp;alpha;&amp;beta;. The set ''C''(&amp;alpha;,&amp;beta;) is defined by induction on &amp;alpha; to be the set of ordinals that can be generated from 0, [[First uncountable ordinal|&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]], &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;omega;&lt;/sub&gt;, together with the ordinals less than &amp;beta; by the operations of ordinal addition and the functions &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;xi;&lt;/sub&gt; for &amp;xi;&lt;&amp;alpha;. And the function &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;gamma;&lt;/sub&gt; is defined to be the function enumerating the ordinals &amp;delta; with &amp;delta;&amp;notin;''C''(&amp;gamma;,&amp;delta;).

===Buchholz===
{{main|Ordinal collapsing function}}
{{harvtxt|Buchholz|1986}} described the following system of ordinal notation as a simplification of Feferman's theta functions. Define:
*&amp;Omega;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;xi;&lt;/sub&gt; = &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;&amp;xi;&lt;/sub&gt; if &amp;xi; &gt; 0, &amp;Omega;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1
The  functions &amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;alpha;) for &amp;alpha; an ordinal, ''v'' an ordinal at most &amp;omega;, are defined by induction on &amp;alpha; as follows: 
*&amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;alpha;) is the smallest ordinal not in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;alpha;)
where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;alpha;)  is the smallest set such that 
*''C''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;alpha;) contains all ordinals less than &amp;Omega;&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; 
*''C''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;alpha;) is closed under ordinal addition
*''C''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;(&amp;alpha;) is closed under the functions &amp;psi;&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; (for ''u''&amp;le;&amp;omega;) applied to arguments less than &amp;alpha;.

This system has about the same strength as Fefermans system, as &lt;math&gt;\theta\epsilon_{\Omega_v+1}0 = \psi_0(\epsilon_{\Omega_v+1})&lt;/math&gt; for ''v''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;&amp;omega;.

===Kleene's &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;===
{{main|Kleene's O}}
{{harvtxt|Kleene|1938}} described a system of notation for all recursive ordinals (those less than the [[Church–Kleene ordinal]]). It uses a subset of the [[natural number]]s instead of finite strings of symbols. Unfortunately, unlike the other systems described above there is in general no [[computable function|effective]] way to tell whether some natural number represents an ordinal, or whether two numbers represent the same ordinal. However, one can effectively find notations that represent the ordinal sum, product, and power (see [[ordinal arithmetic]]) of any two given notations in Kleene's &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt;; and given any notation for an ordinal, there is a [[recursively enumerable set]] of notations that contains one element for each smaller ordinal and is effectively ordered. Kleene's &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}&lt;/math&gt; denotes a canonical (and very non-computable) set of notations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9415">In [[graph theory]], a '''perfectly orderable graph''' is a graph whose vertices can be ordered in such a way that a [[greedy coloring]] algorithm with that ordering optimally colors every [[induced subgraph]] of the given graph. Perfectly orderable graphs form a special case of the [[perfect graph]]s, and they include the [[chordal graph]]s, [[comparability graph]]s, and [[distance-hereditary graph]]s. However, testing whether a graph is perfectly orderable is [[NP-complete]].

==Definition==
The greedy coloring algorithm, when applied to a given ordering of the vertices of a graph ''G'', considers the vertices of the graph in sequence and assigns each vertex its first available color, the [[Mex (mathematics)|minimum excluded value]] for the set of colors used by its neighbors. Different vertex orderings may lead this algorithm to use different numbers of colors. There is always an ordering that leads to an optimal coloring – this is true, for instance, of the ordering determined from an optimal coloring by sorting the vertices by their color – but it may be difficult to find.
The perfectly orderable graphs are defined to be the graphs for which there is an ordering that is optimal for the greedy algorithm not just for the graph itself, but for all of its [[induced subgraph]]s.

More formally, a graph ''G'' is said to be ''perfectly orderable'' if there exists an ordering π of the vertices of ''G'', such that every [[induced subgraph]] of ''G'' is optimally colored by the greedy algorithm using the subsequence of π induced by the vertices of the subgraph. An ordering π has this property exactly when there do not exist four vertices ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'' for which ''abcd'' is an induced path, ''a'' appears before ''b'' in the ordering, and ''c'' appears after ''d'' in the ordering.&lt;ref name="pog"&gt;{{harvtxt|Chvátal|1984}}; {{harvtxt|Maffray|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computational complexity==
Perfectly orderable graphs are NP-complete to recognize.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Middendorf|Pfeiffer|1990}}; {{harvtxt|Maffray|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is easy to test whether a particular ordering is a perfect ordering of a graph. Consequently, it is also NP-hard to find a perfect ordering of a graph, even if the graph is already known to be perfectly orderable.

==Related graph classes==
Every perfectly orderable graph is a [[perfect graph]].&lt;ref name="pog"/&gt;

[[Chordal graph]]s are perfectly orderable; a perfect ordering of a chordal graph may be found by reversing a perfect elimination ordering for the graph. Thus, applying greedy coloring to a perfect ordering provides an efficient algorithm for optimally coloring chordal graphs. [[Comparability graph]]s are also perfectly orderable, with a perfect ordering being given by a [[topological ordering]] of a [[transitive orientation]] of the graph.&lt;ref name="pog"/&gt;

Another class of perfectly orderable graphs is given by the graphs ''G'' such that, in every subset of five vertices from ''G'', at least one of the five has a closed [[neighborhood (graph theory)|neighborhood]] that is a subset of (or equal to) the closed neighborhood of another of the five vertices. Equivalently, these are the graphs in which the [[partially ordered set|partial order]] of closed neighborhoods, ordered by set inclusion, has [[Dilworth's theorem|width]] at most four. The 5-vertex [[cycle graph]] has a neighborhood partial order of width five, so four is the maximum width that ensures perfect orderability. As with the chordal graphs (and unlike the perfectly orderable graphs more generally) the graphs with width four are recognizable in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Payan|1983}}; {{harvtxt|Felsner|Raghavan|Spinrad|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A concept intermediate between the perfect elimination ordering of a chordal graph and a perfect ordering is a ''semiperfect elimination ordering'': in an elimination ordering, there is no three-vertex [[induced path]] in which the middle vertex is the first of the three to be eliminated, and in a semiperfect elimination ordering, there is no four-vertex induced path in which one of the two middle vertices is the first to be eliminated. The reverse of this ordering therefore satisfies the requirements of a perfect ordering, so graphs with semiperfect elimination orderings are perfectly orderable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hoàng|Reed|1989}}; {{harvtxt|Brandstädt|Le|Spinrad|1999}}, pp. 70 and 82.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the same [[lexicographic breadth-first search]] algorithm used to find perfect elimination orders of chordal graphs can be used to find semiperfect elimination orders of [[distance-hereditary graph]]s, which are therefore also perfectly orderable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brandstädt|Le|Spinrad|1999}}, Theorem 5.2.4, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphs for which every vertex ordering is a perfect ordering are the [[cograph]]s. Because cographs are the graphs with no four-vertex induced path, they cannot violate the path-ordering requirement on a perfect ordering.

Several additional classes of perfectly orderable graphs are known.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Chvátal|Hoàng|Mahadev|De Werra|1987}}; {{harvtxt|Hoàng|Reed|1989}}; {{harvtxt|Hoàng|Maffray|Olariu|Preissmann|1992}}; {{harvtxt|Maffray|2003}}; {{harvtxt|Brandstädt|Le|Spinrad|1999}}, pp. 81–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=June 2011}}
'''Predictive analytics''' encompasses a variety of statistical techniques from [[data mining]], [[Predictive modelling|predictive modelling]], and [[machine learning]], that analyze current and historical facts to make predictions about future or otherwise unknown events.&lt;ref name="Nyce"&gt;{{citation|last=Nyce|first=Charles|title=Predictive Analytics White Paper|url=https://www.the-digital-insurer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/78-Predictive-Modeling-White-Paper.pdf|publisher=American Institute for Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters/Insurance Institute of America|year=2007|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eckerson"&gt;{{citation|last=Eckerson|first=Wayne|title=Extending the Value of Your Data Warehousing Investment|url=http://tdwi.org/articles/2007/05/10/predictive-analytics.aspx?sc_lang=en|publisher=The Data Warehouse Institute|date=May 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In business, predictive models exploit [[pattern detection|patterns]] found in historical and transactional data to identify risks and opportunities. Models capture relationships among many factors to allow assessment of risk or potential associated with a particular set of conditions, guiding [[decision making]] for candidate transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coker|first1=Frank|title=Pulse: Understanding the Vital Signs of Your Business |date=2014|publisher=Ambient Light Publishing|location=Bellevue, WA|isbn=978-0-9893086-0-1|pages=30, 39, 42, more |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining functional effect of these technical approaches is that predictive analytics provides a predictive score (probability) for each individual (customer, employee, healthcare patient, product SKU, vehicle, component, machine, or other organizational unit) in order to determine, inform, or influence organizational processes that pertain across large numbers of individuals, such as in marketing, credit risk assessment, fraud detection, manufacturing, healthcare, and government operations including law enforcement.

One of the best-known applications is [[credit scoring]],&lt;ref name="Nyce" /&gt; which is used throughout [[financial services]]. Scoring models process a customer's [[credit history]], [[loan application]], customer data, etc., in order to rank-order individuals by their likelihood of making future credit payments on time.

==Definition==
Predictive analytics is an area of statistics that deals with [[information extraction|extracting information]] from data and using it to predict [[trend analysis|trend]]s and behavior patterns.  The enhancement of predictive web analytics calculates statistical probabilities of future events online. Predictive analytics statistical techniques include data modeling, machine learning, AI, deep learning algorithms and data mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.personali.com/answers/predictive-analytics/|title=UX Optimization Glossary &gt; Data Science &gt; Web Analytics &gt; Predictive Analytics|last=Personali|first=|date=|website=www.personali.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the unknown event of interest is in the future, but predictive analytics can be applied to any type of unknown whether it be in the past, present or future. For example, identifying suspects after a crime has been committed, or credit card fraud as it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finlay|first1=Steven|title=Predictive Analytics, Data Mining and Big Data. Myths, Misconceptions and Methods|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=1137379278|pages=237|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core of predictive analytics relies on capturing relationships between [[explanatory variable]]s and the predicted variables from past occurrences, and exploiting them to predict the unknown outcome. It is important to note, however, that the accuracy and usability of results will depend greatly on the level of data analysis and the quality of assumptions.

Predictive analytics is often defined as predicting at a more detailed level of granularity, i.e., generating predictive scores (probabilities) for each individual organizational element. This distinguishes it from forecasting. For example, "Predictive analytics—Technology that learns from experience (data) to predict the future behavior of individuals in order to drive better decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siegel|first1=Eric|title=Predictive Analytics: The Power to Predict Who Will Click, Buy, Lie, or Die|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-1183-5685-2|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; In future industrial systems, the value of predictive analytics will be to predict and prevent potential issues to achieve near-zero break-down and further be integrated into [[prescriptive analytics]] for decision optimization.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Furthermore, the converted data can be used for closed-loop product life cycle improvement&lt;ref name="WatchdogPaper"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Djurdjanovic|first1=Dragan|last2=Lee|first2=Jay|last3=Ni|first3=Jun|title=Watchdog Agent—an infotronics-based prognostics approach for product performance degradation assessment and prediction|journal=Advanced Engineering Informatics|date=July 2003|volume=17|issue=3–4|pages=109–125|doi=10.1016/j.aei.2004.07.005|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474034604000102}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the vision of the [[Industrial Internet Consortium]].

Predictive Analytics Process
]]

== Predictive analytics process ==
# '''Define project''' : Define the project outcomes, deliverable, scope of the effort, business objectives, identify the data sets that are going to be used.
# '''Data collection''' : Data mining for predictive analytics prepares data from multiple sources for analysis. This provides a complete view of customer interactions.
# '''Data analysis''' : Data Analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning and modelling data with the objective of discovering useful information, arriving at conclusion
# '''Statistics''' : Statistical Analysis enables to validate the assumptions, hypothesis and test them using standard statistical models.
# '''Modelling''' : Predictive modelling provides the ability to automatically create accurate predictive models about future. There are also options to choose the best solution with multi-modal evaluation.
# '''Deployment''' : Predictive model deployment provides the option to deploy the analytical results into everyday decision making process to get results, reports and output by automating the decisions based on the modelling.
# '''Model monitoring''' : Models are managed and monitored to review the model performance to ensure that it is providing the results expected.

==Types==
Generally, the term predictive analytics is used to mean [[predictive modeling]], "scoring" data with predictive models, and [[forecasting]]. However, people are increasingly using the term to refer to related analytical disciplines, such as descriptive modeling and decision modeling or optimization. These disciplines also involve rigorous data analysis, and are widely used in business for segmentation and decision making, but have different purposes and the statistical techniques underlying them vary.

===Predictive models===
[[Predictive modeling|Predictive models]] are models of the relation between the specific performance of a unit in a sample and one or more known attributes or features of the unit. The objective of the model is to assess the likelihood that a similar unit in a different sample will exhibit the specific performance. This category encompasses models in many areas, such as marketing, where they seek out subtle data patterns to answer questions about customer performance, or fraud detection models. Predictive models often perform calculations during live transactions, for example, to evaluate the risk or opportunity of a given customer or transaction, in order to guide a decision. With advancements in computing speed, individual agent modeling systems have become capable of simulating human behaviour or reactions to given stimuli or scenarios.

The available sample units with known attributes and known performances is referred to as the "training sample". The units in other samples, with known attributes but unknown performances, are referred to as "out of [training] sample" units. The out of sample units do not necessarily bear a chronological relation to the training sample units. For example, the training sample may consist of literary attributes of writings by Victorian authors, with known attribution, and the out-of sample unit may be newly found writing with unknown authorship; a predictive model may aid in attributing a work to a known author. Another example is given by analysis of blood splatter in simulated crime scenes in which the out of sample unit is the actual blood splatter pattern from a crime scene. The out of sample unit may be from the same time as the training units, from a previous time, or from a future time.

===Descriptive models===
Descriptive models quantify relationships in data in a way that is often used to classify customers or prospects into groups. Unlike predictive models that focus on predicting a single customer behavior (such as credit risk), descriptive models identify many different relationships between customers or products. Descriptive models do not rank-order customers by their likelihood of taking a particular action the way predictive models do. Instead, descriptive models can be used, for example, to categorize customers by their product preferences and life stage. Descriptive modeling tools can be utilized to develop further models that can simulate large number of individualized agents and make predictions.

===Decision models===
{{Main article|Decision model}}
[[Decision model]]s describe the relationship between all the elements of a decision—the known data (including results of predictive models), the decision, and the forecast results of the decision—in order to predict the results of decisions involving many variables. These models can be used in optimization, maximizing certain outcomes while minimizing others. Decision models are generally used to develop decision logic or a set of business rules that will produce the desired action for every customer or circumstance.

==Applications==
Although predictive analytics can be put to use in many applications, we outline a few examples where predictive analytics has shown positive impact in recent years.

===Analytical customer relationship management (CRM)===
Analytical [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) is a frequent commercial application of predictive analysis. Methods of predictive analysis are applied to customer data to pursue CRM objectives, which involve constructing a holistic view of the customer no matter where their information resides in the company or the department involved. CRM uses predictive analysis in applications for marketing campaigns, sales, and customer services to name a few. These tools are required in order for a company to posture and focus their efforts effectively across the breadth of their customer base.  They must analyze and understand the products in demand or have the potential for high demand, predict customers' buying habits in order to promote relevant products at multiple [[touch point]]s, and proactively identify and mitigate issues that have the potential to lose customers or reduce their ability to gain new ones. Analytical customer relationship management can be applied throughout the [[Customer lifecycle management|customers' lifecycle]] ([[Customer acquisition management|acquisition]], [[Cross-selling|relationship growth]], [[Customer retention|retention]], and win-back). Several of the application areas described below (direct marketing, cross-sell, customer retention) are part of customer relationship management.

===Child protection===
Over the last 5 years, some child welfare agencies have started using predictive analytics to flag high risk cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chronicleofsocialchange.org/blogger-co-op/new-strategies-long-overdue-measuring-child-welfare-risk/15442|title=New Strategies Long Overdue on Measuring Child Welfare Risk - The Chronicle of Social Change|website=The Chronicle of Social Change|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach has been called "innovative" by the Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities (CECANF),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eckerd.org/2016/03/23/eckerd-rapid-safety-feedback-highlighted-national-report-commission-eliminate-child-abuse-neglect-fatalities/|title=Eckerd Rapid Safety Feedback® Highlighted in National Report of Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities|website=Eckerd Kids|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Hillsborough County, Florida]], where the lead child welfare agency uses a predictive modeling tool, there have been no abuse-related child deaths in the target population as of this writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/cecanf_final_report.pdf|title=A National Strategy to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities|date=|website=|publisher=Commission to Eliminate Child Abuse and Neglect Fatalities. (2016)|access-date=April 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical decision support systems===
Experts use predictive analysis in health care primarily to determine which patients are at risk of developing certain conditions, like diabetes, asthma, heart disease, and other lifetime illnesses. Additionally, sophisticated [[clinical decision support system]]s incorporate predictive analytics to support medical decision making at the point of care. A working definition has been proposed by Jerome A. Osheroff and colleagues:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jamia.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/2/141.short|title=A Roadmap for National Action on Clinical Decision Support|website=JAMIA|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Clinical decision support ('''CDS''') provides clinicians, staff, patients, or other individuals with knowledge and person-specific information, intelligently filtered or presented at appropriate times, to enhance health and health care. It encompasses a variety of tools and interventions such as computerized alerts and reminders, clinical guidelines, order sets, patient data reports and dashboards, documentation templates, diagnostic support, and clinical workflow tools''.

A 2016 study of [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative disorders]] provides a powerful example of a CDS platform to diagnose, track, predict and monitor the progression of [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Predictive Big Data Analytics: A Study of Parkinson's Disease using Large, Complex, Heterogeneous, Incongruent, Multi-source and Incomplete Observations|website=PLoS ONE|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0157077 | volume=11|page=e0157077|bibcode=2016PLoSO..1157077D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using large and multi-source imaging, genetics, clinical and demographic data, these investigators developed a decision support system that can predict the state of the disease with high accuracy, consistency and precision. They employed classical model-based and machine learning model-free methods to discriminate between different patient and control groups. Similar approaches may be used for predictive diagnosis and disease progression forecasting in many neurodegenerative disorders like [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]], [[Huntington's disease|Huntington’s]], [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]], and for other clinical and biomedical applications where Big Data is available.

===Collection analytics===
Many portfolios have a set of delinquent customers who do not make their payments on time. The financial institution has to undertake collection activities on these customers to recover the amounts due. A lot of collection resources are wasted on customers who are difficult or impossible to recover. Predictive analytics can help optimize the allocation of collection resources by identifying the most effective collection agencies, contact strategies, legal actions and other strategies to each customer, thus significantly increasing recovery at the same time reducing collection costs.

===Cross-sell===
Often corporate organizations collect and maintain abundant data (e.g. customer [[Business record|record]]s, sale transactions) as exploiting hidden relationships in the data can provide a competitive advantage. For an organization that offers multiple products, predictive analytics can help analyze customers' spending, usage and other behavior, leading to efficient [[cross-selling|cross sales]], or selling additional products to current customers.&lt;ref name="Eckerson" /&gt; This directly leads to higher profitability per customer and stronger customer relationships.

===Customer retention===
With the number of competing services available, businesses need to focus efforts on maintaining continuous [[customer satisfaction]], rewarding consumer loyalty and minimizing [[customer attrition]]. In addition, small increases in customer retention have been shown to increase profits disproportionately. One study concluded that a 5% increase in customer retention rates will increase profits by 25% to 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reichheld|first1=Frederick|last2=Schefter|first2=Phil|title=The Economics of E-Loyalty |url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/1590.html|work=Havard Business School Working Knowledge|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses tend to respond to customer attrition on a reactive basis, acting only after the customer has initiated the process to terminate service. At this stage, the chance of changing the customer's decision is almost zero. Proper application of predictive analytics can lead to a more proactive retention strategy. By a frequent examination of a customer's past service usage, service performance, spending and other behavior patterns, predictive models can determine the likelihood of a customer terminating service sometime soon.&lt;ref  name="Barkin" /&gt; An intervention with lucrative offers can increase the chance of retaining the customer. Silent attrition, the behavior of a customer to slowly but steadily reduce usage, is another problem that many companies face. Predictive analytics can also predict this behavior, so that the company can take proper actions to increase customer activity.

===Direct marketing===
When [[marketing]] consumer products and services, there is the challenge of keeping up with competing products and consumer behavior. Apart from identifying prospects, predictive analytics can also help to identify the most effective combination of product versions, marketing material, communication channels and timing that should be used to target a given consumer. The goal of predictive analytics is typically to lower the [[cost per order]] or [[cost per action]].

===Fraud detection===
[[Fraud]] is a big problem for many businesses and can be of various types: inaccurate credit applications, fraudulent [[financial transaction|transactions]] (both offline and online), [[identity theft]]s and false [[insurance claim]]s. Some examples of likely victims are [[Credit card fraud|credit card issuers]], insurance companies,&lt;ref name = "Schiff"&gt;{{citation|last=Schiff|first=Mike|title=BI Experts: Why Predictive Analytics Will Continue to Grow|url=http://tdwi.org/Articles/2012/03/06/Predictive-Analytics-Growth.aspx?Page=1|publisher=The Data Warehouse Institute|date=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; retail merchants, manufacturers, business-to-business suppliers and even services providers. A predictive model can help weed out the "bads" and reduce a business's exposure to fraud.

Predictive modeling can also be used to identify high-risk fraud candidates in business or the public sector. [[Mark Nigrini]] developed a risk-scoring method to identify audit targets. He describes the use of this approach to detect fraud in the franchisee sales reports of an international fast-food chain. Each location is scored using 10 predictors. The 10 scores are then weighted to give one final overall risk score for each location. The same scoring approach was also used to identify high-risk check kiting accounts, potentially fraudulent travel agents, and questionable vendors. A reasonably complex model was used to identify fraudulent monthly reports submitted by divisional controllers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) of the United States also uses predictive analytics to mine tax returns and identify [[tax fraud]].&lt;ref name="Schiff" /&gt;

Recent{{When|date=October 2011}} advancements in technology have also introduced predictive behavior analysis for web fraud detection. This type of solution utilizes [[heuristics]] in order to study normal web user behavior and detect anomalies indicating fraud attempts.

===Portfolio, product or economy-level prediction===
Often the focus of analysis is not the consumer but the product, portfolio, firm, industry or even the economy. For example, a retailer might be interested in predicting store-level demand for inventory management purposes. Or the Federal Reserve Board might be interested in predicting the unemployment rate for the next year. These types of problems can be addressed by predictive analytics using time series techniques (see below). They can also be addressed via machine learning approaches which transform the original time series into a feature vector space, where the learning algorithm finds patterns that have predictive power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dhar |first=Vasant |title=Prediction in Financial Markets: The Case for Small Disjuncts |journal=ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology|date=April 2011|volume=2|issue=3|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1961191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dhar|first=Vasant |author2=Chou, Dashin |author3=Provost Foster|title=Discovering Interesting Patterns in Investment Decision Making with GLOWER – A Genetic Learning Algorithm Overlaid With Entropy Reduction|journal=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery|date=October 2000|volume=4|issue=4|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=593502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Project risk management===
{{Main article|Project risk management}}

When employing risk management techniques, the results are always to predict and benefit from a future scenario. The [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAP-M) "predicts" the best portfolio to maximize return. [[Probabilistic risk assessment]] (PRA) when combined with mini-[[Delphi method|Delphi techniques]] and statistical approaches yields accurate forecasts. These are examples of approaches that can extend from project to market, and from near to long term. [[Underwriting]] (see below) and other business approaches identify risk management as a predictive method.

===Underwriting===

Many businesses have to account for risk exposure due to their different services and determine the cost needed to cover the risk. For example, auto insurance providers need to accurately determine the amount of premium to charge to cover each automobile and driver. A financial company needs to assess a borrower's potential and ability to pay before granting a loan. For a health insurance provider, predictive analytics can analyze a few years of past medical claims data, as well as lab, pharmacy and other records where available, to predict how expensive an enrollee is likely to be in the future. Predictive analytics can help [[underwrite]] these quantities by predicting the chances of illness, [[Default (finance)|default]], [[bankruptcy]], etc. Predictive analytics can streamline the process of customer acquisition by predicting the future risk behavior of a customer using application level data.&lt;ref name="Conz" /&gt; Predictive analytics in the form of credit scores have reduced the amount of time it takes for loan approvals, especially in the mortgage market where lending decisions are now made in a matter of hours rather than days or even weeks. Proper predictive analytics can lead to proper pricing decisions, which can help mitigate future risk of default.

==Technology and big data influences==
[[Big data]] is a collection of data sets that are so large and complex that they become awkward to work with using traditional [[database management]] tools. The volume, variety and velocity of big data have introduced challenges across the board for capture, storage, search, sharing, analysis, and visualization. Examples of big data sources include [[web log]]s, [[RFID]], [[sensor network|sensor]] data, [[social network]]s, Internet search indexing, call detail records, military surveillance, and complex data in astronomic, biogeochemical, genomics, and atmospheric sciences. Big Data is the core of most predictive analytic services offered by IT organizations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hcltech.com/sites/default/files/key_to_monetizing_big_data_via_predictive_analytics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thanks to technological advances in computer hardware—faster CPUs, cheaper memory, and [[Massive parallel processing|MPP]] architectures—and new technologies such as [[Hadoop]], [[MapReduce]], and [[In-database processing|in-database]] and [[text analytics]] for processing big data, it is now feasible to collect, analyze, and mine massive amounts of structured and [[unstructured data]] for new insights.&lt;ref name="Schiff" /&gt; It is also possible to run predictive algorithms on streaming data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~mpechen/publications/pubs/PA_EDS_HPCS15.pdf|title=Predictive Analytics on Evolving Data Streams|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, exploring big data and using predictive analytics is within reach of more organizations than ever before and new methods that are capable for handling such datasets are proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Analytical techniques==

The approaches and techniques used to conduct predictive analytics can broadly be grouped into regression techniques and machine learning techniques.

===Regression techniques===

[[Regression analysis|Regression]] models are the mainstay of predictive analytics. The focus lies on establishing a mathematical equation as a model to represent the interactions between the different variables in consideration. Depending on the situation, there are a wide variety of models that can be applied while performing predictive analytics. Some of them are briefly discussed below.

====Linear regression model====

The [[linear regression model]] analyzes the relationship between the response or dependent variable and a set of independent or predictor variables. This relationship is expressed as an equation that predicts the response variable as a linear function of the parameters. These parameters are adjusted so that a measure of fit is optimized. Much of the effort in model fitting is focused on minimizing the size of the residual, as well as ensuring that it is randomly distributed with respect to the model predictions.

The goal of regression is to select the parameters of the model so as to minimize the sum of the squared residuals.  This is referred to as [[ordinary least squares]] (OLS) estimation and results in best linear unbiased estimates (BLUE) of the parameters if and only if the [[Gauss–Markov theorem|Gauss-Markov]] assumptions are satisfied.

Once the model has been estimated we would be interested to know if the predictor variables belong in the model—i.e. is the estimate of each variable's contribution reliable? To do this we can check the statistical significance of the model's coefficients which can be measured using the t-statistic. This amounts to testing whether the coefficient is significantly different from zero. How well the model predicts the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variables can be assessed by using the R² statistic. It measures predictive power of the model i.e. the proportion of the total variation in the dependent variable that is "explained" (accounted for) by variation in the independent variables.

====Discrete choice models====

Multiple regression (above) is generally used when the response variable is continuous and has an unbounded range. Often the response variable may not be continuous but rather discrete. While mathematically it is feasible to apply multiple regression to discrete ordered dependent variables, some of the assumptions behind the theory of multiple linear regression no longer hold, and there are other techniques such as discrete choice models which are better suited for this type of analysis. If the dependent variable is discrete, some of those superior methods are [[logistic regression]], [[multinomial logit]] and [[probit]] models. Logistic regression and probit models are used when the dependent variable is [[binary numeral system|binary]].

====Logistic regression====
{{Main article|Logistic regression}}
In a classification setting, assigning outcome probabilities to observations can be achieved through the use of a logistic model, which is basically a method which transforms information about the binary dependent variable into an unbounded continuous variable and estimates a regular multivariate model (See Allison's ''Logistic Regression'' for more information on the theory of logistic regression).

The [[Wald test|Wald]] and [[likelihood-ratio test]] are used to test the statistical significance of each coefficient ''b'' in the model (analogous to the t tests used in OLS regression; see above). A test assessing the goodness-of-fit of a classification model is the "percentage correctly predicted".

====Multinomial logistic regression====

An extension of the [[binary logit model]] to cases where the dependent variable has more than 2 categories is the [[multinomial logit model]]. In such cases collapsing the data into two categories might not make good sense or may lead to loss in the richness of the data. The multinomial logit model is the appropriate technique in these cases, especially when the dependent variable categories are not ordered (for examples colors like red, blue, green). Some authors have extended multinomial regression to include feature selection/importance methods such as [[random multinomial logit]].

====Probit regression====

[[Probit model]]s offer an alternative to logistic regression for modeling categorical dependent variables. Even though the outcomes tend to be similar, the underlying distributions are different. Probit models are popular in social sciences like economics.

A good way to understand the key difference between probit and logit models is to assume that the dependent variable is driven by a latent variable z, which is a sum of a linear combination of explanatory variables and a random noise term.

We do not observe z but instead observe y which takes the value 0 (when z &lt; 0) or 1 (otherwise). In the logit model we assume that the random noise term follows a [[logistic distribution]] with mean zero. In the probit model we assume that it follows a normal distribution with mean zero. Note that in social sciences (e.g. economics), probit is often used to model situations where the observed variable y is continuous but takes values between 0 and 1.

====Logit versus probit====

The [[probit model]] has been around longer than the [[logit model]]. They behave similarly, except that the [[logistic distribution]] tends to be slightly flatter tailed. One of the reasons the logit model was formulated was that the probit model was computationally difficult due to the requirement of numerically calculating integrals. Modern computing however has made this computation fairly simple. The coefficients obtained from the logit and probit model are fairly close. However, the [[odds ratio]] is easier to interpret in the logit model.

Practical reasons for choosing the probit model over the logistic model would be:
* There is a strong belief that the underlying distribution is normal
* The actual event is not a binary outcome (''e.g.'', bankruptcy status) but a proportion (''e.g.'', proportion of population at different debt levels).

====Time series models====

[[Time series]] models are used for predicting or forecasting the future behavior of variables. These models account for the fact that data points taken over time may have an internal structure (such as autocorrelation, trend or seasonal variation) that should be accounted for. As a result, standard regression techniques cannot be applied to time series data and methodology has been developed to decompose the trend, seasonal and cyclical component of the series. Modeling the dynamic path of a variable can improve forecasts since the predictable component of the series can be projected into the future.

Time series models estimate difference equations containing stochastic components. Two commonly used forms of these models are [[autoregressive model]]s (AR) and [[Moving-average model|moving-average]] (MA) models. The [[Box–Jenkins]] methodology (1976) developed by George Box and G.M. Jenkins combines the AR and MA models to produce the [[Autoregressive moving average model|ARMA]] (autoregressive moving average) model, which is the cornerstone of stationary time series analysis. [[Autoregressive integrated moving average|ARIMA]] (autoregressive integrated moving average models), on the other hand, are used to describe non-stationary time series. Box and Jenkins suggest differencing a non-stationary time series to obtain a stationary series to which an ARMA model can be applied. Non-stationary time series have a pronounced trend and do not have a constant long-run mean or variance.

Box and Jenkins proposed a three-stage methodology involving model identification, estimation and validation. The identification stage involves identifying if the series is stationary or not and the presence of seasonality by examining plots of the series, autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions.  In the estimation stage, models are estimated using non-linear time series or maximum likelihood estimation procedures. Finally the validation stage involves diagnostic checking such as plotting the residuals to detect outliers and evidence of model fit.

In recent years time series models have become more sophisticated and attempt to model conditional heteroskedasticity with models such as ARCH ([[autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity]]) and GARCH (generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity) models frequently used for financial time series. In addition time series models are also used to understand inter-relationships among economic variables represented by systems of equations using VAR (vector autoregression) and structural VAR models.

====Survival or duration analysis====

[[Survival analysis]] is another name for time-to-event analysis. These techniques were primarily developed in the medical and biological sciences, but they are also widely used in the social sciences like economics, as well as in engineering (reliability and failure time analysis).

Censoring and non-normality, which are characteristic of survival data, generate difficulty when trying to analyze the data using conventional statistical models such as multiple [[linear regression]]. The [[normal distribution]], being a symmetric distribution, takes positive as well as negative values, but duration by its very nature cannot be negative and therefore normality cannot be assumed when dealing with duration/survival data. Hence the normality assumption of regression models is violated.

The assumption is that if the data were not censored it would be representative of the population of interest. In survival analysis, censored observations arise whenever the dependent variable of interest represents the time to a terminal event, and the duration of the study is limited in time.

An important concept in survival analysis is the [[hazard rate]], defined as the probability that the event will occur at time t conditional on surviving until time t. Another concept related to the hazard rate is the survival function which can be defined as the probability of surviving to time t.

Most models try to model the hazard rate by choosing the underlying distribution depending on the shape of the hazard function.  A distribution whose hazard function slopes upward is said to have positive duration dependence, a decreasing hazard shows negative duration dependence whereas constant hazard is a process with no memory usually characterized by the exponential distribution. Some of the distributional choices in survival models are: F, gamma, Weibull, log normal, inverse normal, exponential etc. All these distributions are for a non-negative random variable.

Duration models can be parametric, non-parametric or semi-parametric. Some of the models commonly used are [[Kaplan-Meier]] and Cox proportional hazard model (non parametric).

====Classification and regression trees (CART)====
{{main article|Decision tree learning}}
Globally-optimal classification tree analysis (GO-CTA) (also called hierarchical optimal discriminant analysis) is a generalization of [[optimal discriminant analysis]] that may be used to identify the statistical model that has maximum accuracy for predicting the value of a categorical dependent variable for a dataset consisting of categorical and continuous variables. The output of HODA is a non-orthogonal tree that combines categorical variables and cut points for continuous variables that yields maximum predictive accuracy, an assessment of the exact Type I error rate, and an evaluation of potential cross-generalizability of the statistical model. Hierarchical optimal discriminant analysis may be thought of as a generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant analysis. Optimal discriminant analysis is an alternative to ANOVA (analysis of variance) and regression analysis, which attempt to express one dependent variable as a linear combination of other features or measurements. However, ANOVA and regression analysis give a dependent variable that is a numerical variable, while hierarchical optimal discriminant analysis gives a dependent variable that is a class variable.

Classification and regression trees (CART) are a [[non-parametric statistics|non-parametric]] [[decision tree learning]] technique that produces either classification or regression trees, depending on whether the dependent variable is categorical or numeric, respectively.

[[Decision trees]] are formed by a collection of rules based on variables in the modeling data set:
* Rules based on variables' values are selected to get the best split to differentiate observations based on the dependent variable
* Once a rule is selected and splits a node into two, the same process is applied to each "child" node (i.e. it is a recursive procedure)
* Splitting stops when CART detects no further gain can be made, or some pre-set stopping rules are met. (Alternatively, the data are split as much as possible and then the tree is later [[Pruning (decision trees)|pruned]].)

Each branch of the tree ends in a terminal node. Each observation falls into one and exactly one terminal node, and each terminal node is uniquely defined by a set of rules.

A very popular method for predictive analytics is Leo Breiman's [[random forests]].

====Multivariate adaptive regression splines====

[[Multivariate adaptive regression splines]] (MARS) is a [[Non-parametric statistics|non-parametric]] technique that builds flexible models by fitting [[piecewise]] [[linear regression]]s.

An important concept associated with [[regression spline]]s is that of a knot.  Knot is where one local regression model gives way to another and thus is the point of intersection between two splines.

In multivariate and adaptive regression splines, [[basis function]]s are the tool used for generalizing the search for knots. Basis functions are a set of functions used to represent the information contained in one or more variables.
Multivariate and Adaptive Regression Splines model almost always creates the basis functions in pairs.

Multivariate and adaptive regression spline approach deliberately [[overfit]]s the model and then prunes to get to the optimal model. The algorithm is computationally very intensive and in practice we are required to specify an upper limit on the number of basis functions.

===Machine learning techniques===

[[Machine learning]], a branch of artificial intelligence, was originally employed to develop techniques to enable computers to learn. Today, since it includes a number of advanced statistical methods for regression and classification, it finds application in a wide variety of fields including [[medical diagnostics]], [[credit card fraud]] detection, [[Face recognition|face]] and [[speech recognition]] and analysis of the [[stock market]].  In certain applications it is sufficient to directly predict the dependent variable without focusing on the underlying relationships between variables. In other cases, the underlying relationships can be very complex and the mathematical form of the dependencies unknown. For such cases, machine learning techniques emulate human [[cognition]] and learn from training examples to predict future events.

A brief discussion of some of these methods used commonly for predictive analytics is provided below. A detailed study of machine learning can be found in Mitchell (1997).

====Neural networks====

[[Neural networks]] are [[Nonlinearity|nonlinear]] sophisticated modeling techniques that are able to [[Model (abstract)|model]] complex functions. They can be applied to problems of [[Time series|prediction]], [[Statistical classification|classification]] or [[Control theory|control]] in a wide spectrum of fields such as [[finance]], [[cognitive psychology]]/[[cognitive neuroscience|neuroscience]], [[medicine]], [[engineering]], and [[physics]].

Neural networks are used when the exact nature of the relationship between inputs and output is not known. A key feature of neural networks is that they learn the relationship between inputs and output through training. There are three types of training used by different neural networks: [[Supervised learning|supervised]] and [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised]] training and reinforcement learning, with supervised being the most common one.

Some examples of neural network training techniques are [[backpropagation]], quick propagation, [[Conjugate gradient method|conjugate gradient descent]], [[Radial basis function|projection operator]], Delta-Bar-Delta etc. Some unsupervised network architectures are multilayer [[perceptron]]s, [[Self-organizing map|Kohonen network]]s, [[Hopfield network]]s, etc.

====Multilayer perceptron (MLP)====
The [[multilayer perceptron]] (MLP) consists of an input and an output layer with one or more hidden layers of nonlinearly-activating nodes or sigmoid nodes. This is determined by the weight vector and it is necessary to adjust the weights of the network. The backpropagation employs gradient fall to minimize the squared error between the network output values and desired values for those outputs. The weights adjusted by an iterative process of repetitive present of attributes. Small changes in the weight to get the desired values are done by the process called training the net and is done by the training set (learning rule).

====Radial basis functions====
A [[radial basis function]] (RBF) is a function which has built into it a distance criterion with respect to a center. Such functions can be used very efficiently for interpolation and for smoothing of data. Radial basis functions have been applied in the area of [[neural network]]s where they are used as a replacement for the [[Sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] transfer function. Such networks have 3 layers, the input layer, the hidden layer with the RBF non-linearity and a linear output layer. The most popular choice for the non-linearity is the Gaussian. RBF networks have the advantage of not being locked into local minima as do the [[Feed forward (control)|feed-forward]] networks such as the multilayer [[perceptron]].

====Support vector machines====

[[Support vector machine]]s (SVM) are used to detect and exploit complex patterns in data by clustering, classifying and ranking the data. They are learning machines that are used to perform binary classifications and regression estimations.  They commonly use kernel based methods to apply linear classification techniques to non-linear classification problems. There are a number of types of SVM such as linear, polynomial, sigmoid etc.

====Naïve Bayes====

[[Naive Bayes classifier|Naïve Bayes]] based on Bayes conditional probability rule is used for performing classification tasks. Naïve Bayes assumes the predictors are statistically independent which makes it an effective classification tool that is easy to interpret. It is best employed when faced with the "[[curse of dimensionality]]" problem, i.e. when the number of predictors is very high.

====''k''-nearest neighbours====

The [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|nearest neighbour algorithm]] (KNN) belongs to the class of pattern recognition statistical methods. The method does not impose a priori any assumptions about the distribution from which the modeling sample is drawn. It involves a training set with both positive and negative values.  A new sample is classified by calculating the distance to the nearest neighbouring training case. The sign of that point will determine the classification of the sample. In the k-nearest neighbour classifier, the k nearest points are considered and the sign of the majority is used to classify the sample. The performance of the kNN algorithm is influenced by three main factors: (1) the distance measure used to locate the nearest neighbours, (2) the decision rule used to derive a classification from the k-nearest neighbours, and (3) the number of neighbours used to classify the new sample. It can be proved that, unlike other methods, this method is universally asymptotically convergent, i.e. as the size of the training set increases, if the observations are [[iid|independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)]], regardless of the distribution from which the sample is drawn, the predicted class will converge to the class assignment that minimizes misclassification error. See Devroy et al.

====Geospatial predictive modeling====

Conceptually, [[geospatial predictive modeling]] is rooted in the principle that the occurrences of events being modeled are limited in distribution. Occurrences of events are neither uniform nor random in distribution—there are spatial environment factors (infrastructure, sociocultural, topographic, etc.) that constrain and influence where the locations of events occur. Geospatial predictive modeling attempts to describe those constraints and influences by spatially correlating occurrences of historical geospatial locations with environmental factors that represent those constraints and influences. Geospatial predictive modeling is a process for analyzing events through a geographic filter in order to make statements of likelihood for event occurrence or emergence.

==Tools==
Historically, using predictive analytics tools—as well as understanding the results they delivered—required advanced skills. However, modern predictive analytics tools are no longer restricted to IT specialists.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} As more organizations adopt predictive analytics into decision-making processes and integrate it into their operations, they are creating a shift in the market toward business users as the primary consumers of the information. Business users want tools they can use on their own. Vendors are responding by creating new software that removes the mathematical complexity, provides user-friendly graphic interfaces and/or builds in short cuts that can, for example, recognize the kind of data available and suggest an appropriate predictive model.&lt;ref name="Halper"&gt;{{citation|last=Halper|first=Fern|title=The Top 5 Trends in Predictive Analytics|url=http://www.information-management.com/issues/21_6/the-top-5-trends-in-redictive-an-alytics-10021460-1.html|magazine=Information Management|date=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictive analytics tools have become sophisticated enough to adequately present and dissect data problems,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} so that any data-savvy information worker can utilize them to analyze data and retrieve meaningful, useful results.&lt;ref name="Eckerson" /&gt; For example, modern tools present findings using simple charts, graphs, and scores that indicate the likelihood of possible outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=MacLennan|first=Jamie|title=5 Myths about Predictive Analytics|url=http://tdwi.org/articles/2012/05/01/5-predictive-analytics-myths.aspx|publisher=The Data Warehouse Institute|date=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous tools available in the marketplace that help with the execution of predictive analytics. These range from those that need very little user sophistication to those that are designed for the expert practitioner. The difference between these tools is often in the level of customization and heavy data lifting allowed.

Beside these software packages, specific tools have also been developed for industrial applications. For example, Watchdog Agent Toolbox has been developed and optimized for predictive analysis in [[prognostics and health management]] applications and is available for [[MATLAB]] and [[LabVIEW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watchdog Agent Toolbox for Labview|url=http://sine.ni.com/nips/cds/view/p/lang/en/nid/210191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Watchdog Agent Toolbox|url=http://www.imscenter.net/front-page/Resources/WD.pdf|website=IMSCenter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular commercial predictive analytics software packages according to the Rexer Analytics Survey for 2013 are IBM SPSS Modeler, SAS Enterprise Miner, and Dell Statistica.

===PMML===
The [[Predictive Model Markup Language]] (PMML) was proposed for standard language for expressing predictive models. Such an XML-based language provides a way for the different tools to define predictive models and to share them. PMML 4.0 was released in June, 2009.

==Criticism==
There are plenty of skeptics when it comes to computers' and algorithms' abilities to predict the future, including [[Gary King (political scientist)|Gary King]], a professor from Harvard University and the director of the Institute for Quantitative Social Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Temple-Raston|first=Dina|title=Predicting The Future: Fantasy Or A Good Algorithm?|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/10/08/162397787/predicting-the-future-fantasy-or-a-good-algorithm|publisher=NPR|date=Oct 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; People are influenced by their environment in innumerable ways. Predicting perfectly what people will do next requires that all the influential variables be known and measured accurately. "People's environments change even more quickly than they themselves do. Everything from the weather to their relationship with their mother can change the way people think and act. All of those variables are unpredictable. How they will impact a person is even less predictable. If put in the exact same situation tomorrow, they may make a completely different decision. This means that a statistical prediction is only valid in sterile laboratory conditions, which suddenly isn't as useful as it seemed before."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Alverson|first=Cameron|title=Polling and Statistical Models Can't Predict the Future |url=http://www.cameronalverson.com/2012/09/polling-and-statistical-models-cant.html|publisher=Cameron Alverson|date=Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of 1072 papers published in Information Systems Research and MIS Quarterly between 1990 and 2006, only 52 empirical papers attempted predictive claims, of which only 7 carried out proper predictive modeling or testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shmueli|first=Galit|date=2010-08-01|title=To Explain or to Predict?|url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1294167961|journal=Statistical Science|language=EN|volume=25|issue=3|pages=289–310|doi=10.1214/10-STS330|issn=0883-4237|arxiv=1101.0891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ralph Jasper Faudree''' (August 23, 1939 – January 13, 2015) was a [[mathematician]], a professor of mathematics and the former [[Provost (education)|provost]] of the [[University of Memphis]].&lt;ref name="mtp"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120808235856/http://www.memphis.edu/mediaroom/releases/aug12/faudree.htm],  Faudree to Step Down as University Provost - retrieved 2014-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former U of M Provost Ralph Faudree Dies|date=14 January 2015|website=News Blog, Memphis News and Events, Memphis Flyer|url=http://www.memphisflyer.com/NewsBlog/archives/2015/01/14/former-u-of-m-provost-dies-from-self-inflicted-gunshot-wound}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>I changed the authors of this centrality measures. Although often mistaken, Noh and Ridger 2004 created Random Walk Centrality with different definition than presented in this article. This centrality measure was created by White and Smyth (2004) under the name Markov Centrality, but is often referred as Random Walk Closeness centrality because of its similarity to Closeness centrality. See Brandes and Erlebach (2004), chapter 3.8.3 for reference.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7406">'''Random walk closeness centrality''' is a measure of [[centrality]] in a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|network]], which describes the average speed with which [[Random walk|randomly walking]] processes reach a node from other nodes of the network. It is similar to the [[closeness centrality]] except that the farness is measured by the expected length of a [[random walk]] rather than by the [[Shortest path problem|shortest path]].

The concept was first proposed by White and Smyth (2003) under the name ''Markov centrality''.&lt;ref&gt;

== Intuition ==

Consider a network with a finite number of nodes and a random walk process that starts in a certain node and proceeds from node to node along the edges. From each node, it chooses randomly the edge to be followed. In an unweighted network, the probability of choosing a certain edge is equal across all available edges, while in a weighted network it is proportional to the edge weights.
A node is considered to be close to other nodes, if the random walk process initiated from any node of the network arrives to this particular node in relatively few steps on average.

== Definition ==

Consider a weighted network – either directed or undirected – with n nodes denoted by j=1, …, n; and a random walk process on this network with a transition matrix M. The &lt;math&gt;m_{jk}&lt;/math&gt; element of M describes the probability of the random walker that has reached node i, proceeds directly to node j. These probabilities are defined in the following way.

:&lt;math&gt; M(i,j)=\frac{a_{ij}}{\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; a_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the (i,j)th element of the weighting matrix A of the network. When there is no edge between two nodes, the corresponding element of the A matrix is zero.

The random walk closeness centrality of a node i is the inverse of the average mean first passage time to that node:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{i}^{RWC} = \frac{n}{\sum_{j=1}^n H(j,i)} &lt;/math&gt;

=== Mean first passage time ===

The mean first passage time from node i to node j is the expected number of steps it takes for the process to reach node j from node i for the first time:

:&lt;math&gt; H(i,j)=\sum_{r=1}^{\infty} rP(i,j,r) &lt;/math&gt;

where P(i,j,r) denotes the probability that it takes exactly r steps to reach j from i for the first time.
To calculate these probabilities of reaching a node for the first time in r steps, it is useful to regard the target node as an absorbing one, and introduce a transformation of M by deleting its j-th row and column and denoting it by &lt;math&gt; M_{-j}&lt;/math&gt;. As the probability of a process starting at i and being in k after r-1 steps is simply given by the (i,k)th element of &lt;math&gt; M_{-j}^{r-1}&lt;/math&gt;, P(i,j,r) can be expressed as

: &lt;math&gt; P(i,j,r)=\sum_{k \neq j}((M_{-j}^{r-1}))_{ik} m_{kj}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting this into the expression for mean first passage time yields
: &lt;math&gt; H(i,j)=\sum_{r=1}^{\infty} r \sum_{k \neq j}((M_{-j}^{r-1}))_{ik} m_{kj}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the formula for the summation of [[geometric series]] for matrices yields

: &lt;math&gt; H(i,j)=\sum_{k \neq j}((I-M_{-j})^{-2})_{ik} m_{kj}&lt;/math&gt;

where I is the n-1 dimensional [[identity matrix]].

For computational convenience, this expression can be vectorized as

: &lt;math&gt; H(.,j)= (I-M_{-j})^{-1}e&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H(.,j)&lt;/math&gt; is the vector for first passage times for a walk ending at node j, and e is an n-1 dimensional vector of ones.

Mean first passage time is not symmetric, even for undirected graphs.

== In model networks ==
According to simulations performed by Noh and Rieger (2004), the distribution of random walk closeness centrality in a [[Barabási-Albert model]] is mainly determined by the [[degree distribution]]. In such a network, the random walk closeness centrality of a node is roughly proportional to, but does not increase monotonically with its degree.

== Applications for real networks ==
Random walk closeness centrality is more relevant measure than the simple [[closeness centrality]] in case of applications where the concept of shortest paths is not meaningful or is very restrictive for a reasonable assessment of the nature of the system.
This is the case for example when the analyzed process evolves in the network without any specific intention to reach a certain point, or without the ability of finding the shortest path to reach its target. One example for a random walk in a network is the way a certain coin circulates in an economy: it is passed from one person to another through transactions, without any intention of reaching a specific individual. 
Another example where the concept of shortest paths is not very useful is a densely connected network. Furthermore, as shortest paths are not influenced by [[Loop (graph theory)|self-loops]], random walk closeness centrality is a more adequate measure than [[closeness centrality]] when analyzing networks where [[Loop (graph theory)|self-loops]] are important.

An important application on the field of economics is the analysis of the [[input-output model]] of an economy, which is represented by a densely connected weighted network with important [[Loop (graph theory)|self-loops]].&lt;ref&gt;Blöchl F, Theis FJ, Vega-Redondo F, and Fisher E: Vertex Centralities in Input-Output Networks Reveal the Structure of Modern Economies, Physical Review E, 83(4):046127, 2011. [http://www.eui.eu/Personal/fvega/Articulos-Propios/VertexCentrality.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is widely used in natural sciences as well. One biological application is the analysis of [[protein-protein interactions]].&lt;ref&gt;Aidong, Zhang: Protein Interaction Networks: Computational Analysis (Cambridge University Press) 2007 [http://download.bioon.com.cn/upload/201112/22125825_1810.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Random walk betweenness centrality ==

A related concept, proposed by Newman,&lt;ref&gt;Newman, M.E. J.: A measure of betweenness centrality based on random walks. Social Networks, Volume 27, Issue 1, January 2005, Pages 39–54&lt;/ref&gt; is '''random walk betweenness centrality'''. Just as random walk closeness centrality is a random walk counterpart of [[closeness centrality]], random walk betweenness centrality is, similarly, the random walk counterpart of [[betweenness centrality]]. Unlike the usual betweenness centrality measure, it does not only count shortest paths passing through the given node, but all possible paths crossing it.

Formally, the random walk betweenness centrality of a node is

:&lt;math&gt;C_{i}^{RWB} = \sum_{j \neq i \neq k} r_{jk} &lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;r_{jk}&lt;/math&gt; element of matrix R contains the probability of a random walk starting at node j with absorbing node k, passing through node i.

Calculating random walk betweenness in large networks is computationally very intensive.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, U., Papadimitriou, S., Sun, J., and Tong, H.: Centralities in Large Networks: Algorithms and Observations. SIAM International Conference on Data Mining 2011, Mesa, Arizona, USA. [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ukang/papers/CentralitySDM2011.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rocket City Math League (RCML)''' is a student-run [[List of mathematics competitions|mathematics competition]] in the United States. Run by students at [[Virgil I. Grissom High School]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], RCML gets its name from Huntsville's nickname as the "Rocket City".&lt;ref&gt;Check the {{cite news|url=http://www.rocketcitymath.org/about.html|title=RCML About}} page&lt;/ref&gt;  RCML was started in 2001 and has been annually sponsored by the [[Mu Alpha Theta]] Math Honor Society.  The competition consists of 3 individual rounds and a team round that was added in 2008.  It is divided into 5 divisions named for [[NASA]] programs:  [[Explorer]] (pre-algebra), [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] (algebra I), [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] (geometry), [[Apollo program|Apollo]] (algebra II), and [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]] (comprehensive).

== Individual rounds ==
Each of the 3 individual rounds consists of a 10 question test with a 45-minute time limit.  Out of the 10 questions, there are four 1-point questions, three 2-point questions, two 3-point questions, and one 4-point question, with the more difficult questions having larger point values.  The maximum score on an individual test is 20, and individual tests often contain many interesting space-themed questions.

== Team round ==
The team round is divided into a senior division and a junior division that take separate tests for the team round.  It consists of a 15 question test with a 30-minute time limit, in which team members work together to get as many correct answers as possible.  Out of the 15 questions, there are five 1-point questions, four 2-point questions, three 3-point questions, two 4-point questions, and one 5-point question, making the maximum score on the team test a 35.

The '''Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics''', also called the '''Satter Prize''', is one of twenty-one prizes given out by the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/profession/prizes-awards/prizes#tab2 |title=Prizes and Awards |publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] |accessdate=September 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is presented biennially in recognition of an outstanding contribution to mathematics research by a woman in the previous six years.&lt;ref name="ams"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/profession/prizes-awards/ams-prizes/satter-prize |title=Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics |publisher=American Mathematical Society |accessdate=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award was established in 1990 using a donation from [[Joan Birman]], in memory of her sister, [[Ruth Lyttle Satter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PNIJDAAAQBAJ |title=Complexities: Women in Mathematics |editor1=Case, Bettye|editor1-link=Bettye Anne Case |editor2=Leggett, Anne|editor2-link=Anne M.

In [[differential geometry]], the '''sharp map''' is the [[mapping (mathematics)|mapping]] that converts [[1-form]]s into corresponding [[vector field|vectors]], given a non-degenerate (0,2)-tensor.

== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a manifold and &lt;math&gt;\,\Gamma (TM)&lt;/math&gt; denote the space of all sections of its [[tangent bundle]]. Fix a [[nondegenerate]] (0,2)-[[tensor field]] &lt;math&gt;g \in \Gamma(T^*M^{\otimes 2})&lt;/math&gt; , for example a [[metric tensor]] or a [[symplectic form]]. The definition
:&lt;math&gt;X^\flat := i_X g = g(X,\cdot)&lt;/math&gt;
yields a [[linear map]] sometimes called the [[flat map]]
:&lt;math&gt; \flat : \Gamma(TM) \to \Gamma(T^*M)&lt;/math&gt;
which is an [[isomorphism]], since &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is non-degenerate. Its inverse
:&lt;math&gt;\sharp := \flat^{-1} : \Gamma(T^*M) \to \Gamma(TM)&lt;/math&gt;
is called the sharp map.

'''Speedtest.net''' is a web service that provides free analysis of [[Internet access]] performance metrics, such as connection data rate and latency. It was founded by Ookla in 2006, and is based in [[Seattle, Washington]].

The service measures the [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] (''speed'') and [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] of a visitor's Internet connection against one of 4,759 geographically dispersed [[Server (computing)|servers]] (as of August 2016) located around the world. Each test measures the data rate for the [[download]] direction, i.e. from the server to the user computer, and the [[upload]] data rate, i.e. from the user's computer to the server. The tests are performed within the user's web browser or within [[Mobile app|apps]].  {{As of|September 2018}}, over 21 billion speed tests have been completed.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[https://speedtest.net See tests completed on page.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tests were previously performed using the [[HTTP|HTTP]] protocol at Layer 7 of the [[OSI model]]. To further improve accuracy, Speedtest.net now performs tests via direct [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] sockets and uses a custom protocol for communication between servers and clients.

The site also offers detailed statistics based on test results. This data has been used by numerous publications in the analysis of Internet access data rates around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7098992.stm |title=Broadband speeds around the world |date=December 2, 2007 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10454199"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10454199 |title=The truth about Kiwi broadband |author=Greenop, Matt |date=July 27, 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/hey-telstra-forget-about-broadband/2007/06/23/1182019431084.html |title=Hey Telstra, forget about broadband |author=Lane, Terry |authorlink=Terry Lane |date=June 24, 2007 |work=[[The Age]] |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The owner and operator of Speedtest.net, Ookla, was established in 2006 by a small team of internet and technology veterans. Ookla was acquired by [[Ziff Davis]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://investor.j2global.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=885561|title=Ziff Davis Acquires Ookla...

'''Stochastic portfolio theory (SPT)''' is a mathematical theory for analyzing stock market structure and portfolio behavior introduced by E. Robert Fernholz in 2002.  It is descriptive as opposed to normative, and is consistent with the observed behavior of actual markets.  Normative assumptions, which serve as a basis for earlier theories like [[modern portfolio theory]] (MPT) and the [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM), are absent from SPT.

SPT uses continuous-time [[stochastic processes|random processes]] (in particular, continuous semi-martingales) to represent the prices of individual securities.  Processes with discontinuities, such as jumps, have also been incorporated into the theory.  
&lt;!--
''Since the family of processess considered in SPT is quite ample...''
--&gt;
&lt;!--
SPT is a basis of practical models of market behavior, and has also branched out into other areas of mathematical finance.  In practice, diversity-weighted portfolios have been used for actual portfolio management, and first- and second-order models have been used to represent stock markets as well as other asset classes.  Some of the directions of the mathematical development of the theory are numeraire portfolios, portfolio generating functions, arbitrage, volatility-stabilized markets, Atlas models, and rank-based particle systems.
--&gt;

== Stocks, portfolios and markets ==

SPT considers [[stock|'''stocks''']] and [[stock market|'''stock markets''']], but its methods can be applied to other classes of [[assets]] as well.  A stock is represented by its price process, usually in the '''logarithmic representation'''.  In the case the '''market''' is a collection of stock-price processes &lt;math&gt;X_i,&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt; i=1, \dots, n,&lt;/math&gt; each defined by a continuous [[semimartingale]]
:&lt;math&gt; d \log X_i(t) = \gamma_i(t) \, dt + \sum_{\nu=1}^d \xi_{i \nu}(t) \, dW_{\nu}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; W := (W_1, \dots, W_d)&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional  [[Brownian motion]] [[wiener process|(Wiener) process]] with &lt;math&gt;d \geq n&lt;/math&gt;, and the processes &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\xi_{i \nu}&lt;/math&gt; are [[progressively measurable]] with respect to the Brownian filtration
&lt;math&gt;\{\mathcal{F}_t\} = \{\mathcal{F}^W_t\}&lt;/math&gt;.  In this representation &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; is called the (compound) [[exponential growth|'''growth rate''']] of &lt;math&gt;X_i,&lt;/math&gt; and the '''[[covariance]]''' between &lt;math&gt;\log X_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\log X_j&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{ij}(t)=\sum_{\nu=1}^d \xi_{i \nu}(t) \xi_{j \nu}(t).&lt;/math&gt;  It is frequently assumed that, for all &lt;math&gt;i,&lt;/math&gt; the process &lt;math&gt;\xi_{i,1}^2(t) + \cdots + \xi_{i d}^2(t)&lt;/math&gt; is positive, locally [[Itō calculus#square integrable martingales|square-integrable]], and does not grow too rapidly as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

The logarithmic representation is equivalent to the classical arithmetic representation which uses the '''rate of return''' &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i(t),&lt;/math&gt; however the growth rate can be a meaningful indicator of long-term performance of a financial asset, whereas the rate of return has an upward bias. The relation between the rate of return and the growth rate is
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{i}(t) = \gamma_i(t) + \frac{\sigma_{ii}(t)}{2} &lt;/math&gt;
The usual convention in SPT is to assume that each stock has a single share outstanding, so &lt;math&gt;X_i(t)&lt;/math&gt;
represents the total capitalization of the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th stock at time &lt;math&gt;t,&lt;/math&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt;X(t) = X_1(t) + \cdots + X_n(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the total capitalization of the market. 
Dividends can be included in this representation, but are omitted here for simplicity.

An '''investment strategy''' &lt;math&gt;\pi = (\pi_1 , \cdots, \pi_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of bounded, progressively measurable
processes; the quantity &lt;math&gt;\pi_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents the proportion of total wealth invested in the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th stock at
time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\pi_0(t) := 1 - \sum_{i=1}^n \pi_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the proportion hoarded (invested in a money market with zero interest rate). Negative weights correspond to short positions. The cash strategy &lt;math&gt;\kappa \equiv 0 (\kappa_0 \equiv 1)&lt;/math&gt; keeps all wealth in the money market. A strategy &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is called [[Portfolio (finance)|'''portfolio''']], if it is fully invested in the [[stock market]], that is &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(t) + \cdots + \pi_n (t) = 1&lt;/math&gt; holds, at all times.

The '''value process''' &lt;math&gt;Z_{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; of a strategy &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is always positive and satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;
d \log Z_{\pi}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n \pi_i(t) \, d\log X_i(t) + \gamma_\pi^*(t) \, dt
&lt;/math&gt;

where the process &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\pi}^*&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''excess growth rate process''' and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma_{\pi}^*(t) := \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n \pi_i(t) \sigma_{ii}(t) 
-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j=1}^n \pi_i(t) \pi_j(t) \sigma_{ij}(t)
&lt;/math&gt;

This expression is non-negative for a portfolio with non-negative weights &lt;math&gt;\pi_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; and has been used
in [[quadratic programming|quadratic optimization]] of stock portfolios, a special case of which is optimization with respect to the logarithmic utility function.

The '''market weight processes''',
:&lt;math&gt;
\mu_i(t) := \frac{X_i(t)}{X_1(t) + \cdots + X_n(t)}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;i=1, \dots, n&lt;/math&gt; define the '''market portfolio''' &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.  With the initial condition &lt;math&gt;Z_\mu(0) = X(0),&lt;/math&gt; the associated value process will satisfy &lt;math&gt;Z_{\mu}(t) = X(t)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t.&lt;/math&gt;  
&lt;!--
Let &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\max} (t) = \max(\mu_1(t), \cdots , \mu_n(t))&lt;/math&gt; represent the weight of the
biggest stock.

A number of conditions can be imposed on a market, sometimes to model actual markets and sometimes to emphasize certain types of hypothetical market behavior.  Some commonly invoked conditions are:
# A market is '''nondegenerate''' if the eigenvalues of the [[covariance matrix]] &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_{ij} (t))_{1 \leq i,j \leq n}&lt;/math&gt; are bounded away from zero. It has '''bounded variance''' if the eigenvalues are bounded.
# A market is '''coherent''' if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{lim}_{t\rightarrow\infty} t^{-1} \log(\mu_i(t)) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;i = 1, \dots, n.&lt;/math&gt;
# A market is '''diverse''' on &lt;math&gt;[0, T]&lt;/math&gt; if there exists &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\max}(t) \leq 1 -\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t \in [0, T].&lt;/math&gt;
# A market is '''weakly diverse''' on &lt;math&gt;[0, T]&lt;/math&gt; if there exists &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T \mu_{\max}(t)\, dt \leq 1 - \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Diversity and weak diversity are rather weak conditions, and markets are generally far more diverse than would be tested by these extremes. A measure of market diversity is '''market entropy''', defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;S(\mu(t)) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mu_i(t) \log(\mu_i(t)).&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!--

[[Image:Cumulative turnover processes for cap ranked US stocks in the 1990s from CRSP data.pdf|thumb|300px|right|alt=Figure 3:“cumulative turnover” processes.|
Figure 3 shows the “cumulative turnover” processes at various ranks over the course of a
decade. As expected, the amount of turnover increases as one goes down the capitalization ladder.
There is also a pronounced linear growth in time across all displayed ranks.]]
We consider the vector process &lt;math&gt;(\mu_{(1)}(t), \dots, \mu_{(n)}(t)),&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;0 \leq t &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; of '''ranked market weights'''
:&lt;math&gt; \max_{1\leq i \leq n} \mu_i(t) =: 
\mu_{(1)}(t) \geq \mu_{(2)}(t) \geq \cdots \mu_{(n)}(t) 
:= \min_{1\leq i \leq n} \mu_i(t) &lt;/math&gt;
where ties are resolved “lexicographically”, always in favor of the lowest index. The log-gaps
:&lt;math&gt; G^{(k,k+1)}(t) := \log(\mu_{(k)}(t)/\mu_{(k+1)}(t)),&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt; 0 \leq t &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k=1, \dots, n-1&lt;/math&gt; are continuous, non-negative semimartingales; we denote by &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{(k,k+1)}(t) = L^{G^{(k, k+1)}}(t ; 0)&lt;/math&gt; their local times at the origin. These quantities measure the amount of turnover between ranks &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; during the time-interval &lt;math&gt;[0, t]&lt;/math&gt;.

A market is called '''stochastically stable''', if &lt;math&gt;(\mu_{(1)}(t), \cdots, \mu_{(n)}(t))&lt;/math&gt; [[convergence in distribution|converges in distribution]] as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; to a random vector &lt;math&gt;(M_{(1)} , \cdots, M_{(n)})&lt;/math&gt; with values in the [[Weyl chamber]] 
&lt;math&gt;\{(x_1, \dots, x_n ) \mid x_1 &gt; x_2 &gt; \dots &gt; x_n \text{ and }\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = 1\}&lt;/math&gt; 
of the unit simplex, and if the [[strong law of large numbers]]
:&lt;math&gt;
\lim_{t \rightarrow \infty}\frac{\Lambda^{(k,k+1)}(t)}{t} = \lambda^{(k,k+1)} &gt; 0
&lt;/math&gt;
holds for suitable real constants &lt;math&gt;\lambda^{(1,2)}, \dots, \lambda^{(n-1, n)}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Arbitrage and the numeraire property ==
Given any two investment strategies &lt;math&gt;\pi,\rho&lt;/math&gt; and a real number &lt;math&gt;T &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, we say that &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is '''[[arbitrage]]''' relative to &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; over the time-horizon &lt;math&gt;[0,T]&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(Z_\pi(T) \geq Z_\rho (T)) \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(Z_\pi(T) &gt; Z_\rho (T)) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; both hold; this relative arbitrage is called “strong” if &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}(Z_\pi (T) &gt; Z_\rho (T)) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;  When &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\kappa \equiv 0,&lt;/math&gt; we recover the usual definition of arbitrage relative to cash.
We say that a given strategy &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; has the [[numeraire|'''numeraire property''']], if for any strategy &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; the ratio &lt;math&gt;Z_\pi/Z_\nu&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt;−supermartingale. In such a case, the process &lt;math&gt;1/Z_\nu&lt;/math&gt; is called a “deflator” for the market.

No [[arbitrage]] is possible, over any given time horizon, relative to a strategy &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; that has the numeraire property (either with respect to the underlying probability measure &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt;, or with respect to any other probability measure which is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt;). A strategy &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; with the numeraire property maximizes the asymptotic growth rate from investment, in the sense that
:&lt;math&gt;
\limsup_{T\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1}{T}\log\left(\frac{Z_\pi(T)}{Z_\nu(T)}\right) \leq 0
&lt;/math&gt;
holds for any strategy &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;; it also maximizes the expected log-utility from investment, in the sense that for any strategy &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; and real number &lt;math&gt;T &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; we have
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbb{E}[\log(Z_\pi(T)] \leq \mathbb{E}[\log(Z_\nu(T))].
&lt;/math&gt;
If the vector &lt;math&gt;\alpha(t) = (\alpha_1(t), \cdots, \alpha_n(t))'&lt;/math&gt; of instantaneous rates of return, and the matrix &lt;math&gt;\sigma(t) = (\sigma(t))_{1\leq i,j \leq n}&lt;/math&gt; of instantaneous covariances, are known, then the strategy
:&lt;math&gt;
\nu(t) = \arg\max_{p \in \mathbb{R}^n} (p' \alpha(t) - \tfrac{1}{2}p' \alpha(t) p)
\qquad \text{ for all } 0 \leq t &lt; \infty
&lt;/math&gt;
has the numeraire property whenever the indicated maximum is attained.

The study of the numeraire portfolio links SPT to the so-called Benchmark approach to Mathematical Finance, which takes such a numeraire portfolio as given and provides a way to price contingent claims, without any further assumptions.

A probability measure &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is called [[equivalent martingale measure|'''equivalent martingale measure (EMM)''']] on a given time-horizon &lt;math&gt;[0,T]&lt;/math&gt;, if it has the same null sets as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{P}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_T&lt;/math&gt;, and if the processes &lt;math&gt;X_1(t), \dots, X_n(t)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;0 \leq
t \leq T&lt;/math&gt; are all &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;−martingales. Assuming that such an EMM exists, arbitrage is not possible on &lt;math&gt;[0,T]&lt;/math&gt; relative to either cash &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; or to the market portfolio &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; (or more generally, relative to any
strategy &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; whose wealth process &lt;math&gt;Z_\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a [[martingale (probability theory)|martingale]] under some EMM). Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;\pi, \rho&lt;/math&gt; are portfolios and one of them is arbitrage relative to the other on &lt;math&gt;[0,T]&lt;/math&gt; then no EMM can exist on this horizon.

== Functionally-generated portfolios ==
Suppose we are given a smooth function &lt;math&gt; G : U \rightarrow (0, \infty)&lt;/math&gt; on some neighborhood 
&lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; of the unit simplex in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; . We call
:&lt;math&gt;
\pi_i^{\mathbb{G}}(t) := \mu_i(t) \left( 
D_i \log(\mathbb{G}(\mu(t))) + 1 
- \sum_{j=1}^n \mu_j(t) D_j \log(\mathbb{G}(\mu(t)))
\right)
\qquad \text{ for } 1 \leq i \leq n
&lt;/math&gt;
the '''portfolio generated by the function &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt;'''. It can be shown that all the weights of this portfolio are non-negative, if its generating function &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt; is concave. Under mild conditions, the relative performance of this functionally-generated portfolio &lt;math&gt;\pi_\mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the market portfolio &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, is given by the '''F-G decomposition'''
:&lt;math&gt;
\log\left(
\frac{Z_{\pi^\mathbb{G}}(T)}{Z_{\mu}(T)}
\right)
= \log\left(
\frac{\mathbb{G}(\mu(T))}{\mathbb{G}(\mu(0))}
\right)
+ \int_0^T g(t) \, dt
&lt;/math&gt;
which involves no stochastic integrals.  Here the expression 
:&lt;math&gt;
g(t) := \frac{-1}{2\mathbb{G}(\mu(t))}
\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n
D_{ij}^2 \mathbb{G}(\mu(t)) \mu_i(t) \mu_j(t) \tau_{ij}^\mu(t)
&lt;/math&gt;
is called the '''drift process''' of the portfolio (and it is a non-negative quantity if the generating function &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}&lt;/math&gt; is concave); and the quantities 
:&lt;math&gt;
\tau_{ij}^\mu(t) :=  \sum_{\nu=1}^n (\xi_{i\nu}(t) - \xi_\nu^\mu(t))(\xi_{j\nu}(t) - \xi_\nu^\mu(t)),\qquad 
\xi_{i\nu}(t) := \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_i(t)  \xi_{i\nu}(t)
&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i, j \leq n&lt;/math&gt; are called the '''relative covariances''' between &lt;math&gt;\log (X_i)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\log (X_j)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the market.

=== Examples ===
# The constant function &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G} := w &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; generates the ''market portfolio'' &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;,
# The geometric mean function &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{H}(x) := (x_1 \cdots x_n)^\frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; generates the ''equal-weighted portfolio'' &lt;math&gt;\varphi_i(n) = \frac{1}{n}&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; 1 \leq i \leq n &lt;/math&gt;,
# The modified entropy function &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{S}^c(x) = c - \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \cdot \log(x_i)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; generates the ''modified entropy-weighted portfolio'', 
# The function &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{D}^{(p)}(x) := (\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^p)^\frac{1}{p}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; p &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; generates the ''diversity-weighted portfolio'' &lt;math&gt;\delta_i^{(p)}(t) = \frac{(\mu_i(t))^p}{\sum_{i=1}^n(\mu_i(t))^p} &lt;/math&gt; with ''drift process'' &lt;math&gt;(1-p)\gamma_{\delta^{(p)}}^*(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Arbitrage relative to the market ===
The excess growth rate of the market portfolio admits
the representation &lt;math&gt;2\gamma_\mu^*(t) = \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_i(t) \tau_{ii}^\mu(t)&lt;/math&gt; as a capitalization-weighted average relative stock
variance. This quantity is nonnegative; if it happens to be bounded away from zero, namely
:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma_\mu^*(t) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^n \mu_i(t) \tau_{ii}^\mu(t) \geq h &gt; 0, 
&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;0 \leq t &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; for some real constant &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, then it can be shown using the F-G decomposition that, 
for every &lt;math&gt;T &gt; \mathbb{S}(\mu(0))/h,&lt;/math&gt; there exists a constant &lt;math&gt;c &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; for which the modified entropic portfolio &lt;math&gt;\Theta^{(c)}&lt;/math&gt; is strict arbitrage relative to the market &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;[0, T]&lt;/math&gt;; see Fernholz and Karatzas (2005) for details. It is an
open question, whether such arbitrage exists over arbitrary time horizons (for two special cases, in
which the answer to this question turns out to be affirmative, please see the paragraph below and
the next section).

If the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_{ij}(t))_{1\leq i,j \leq n}&lt;/math&gt; are bounded away from both zero and infinity, the condition &lt;math&gt;\gamma_\mu^*\geq h &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; can be shown to be equivalent to diversity, namely &lt;math&gt;\mu_{\max} \leq 1 - \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; for a suitable &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \in (0, 1).&lt;/math&gt; Then the diversity-weighted portfolio &lt;math&gt;\delta^{(p)}&lt;/math&gt; leads to strict arbitrage
relative to the market portfolio over sufficiently long time horizons; whereas, suitable modifications
of this diversity-weighted portfolio realize such strict arbitrage over arbitrary time horizons.

== An example: volatility-stabilized markets ==
We consider the example of a system of [[stochastic differential equations]]
:&lt;math&gt;
d\log(X_i(t)) = \frac{\alpha}{2\mu_i(t)}\, dt + \frac{\sigma}{\mu_i(t)}\, dW_i(t)
&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;1\leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt; given real constants &lt;math&gt;\alpha \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; and an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional Brownian motion 
&lt;math&gt;(W_1 , \dots, W_n).&lt;/math&gt; It follows from the work of Bass and Perkins (2002) that this system has a weak solution, which is unique in distribution. Fernholz and Karatzas (2005) show how to construct this solution in terms of scaled and time-changed squared [[Bessel processes]], and prove that the resulting system is coherent.

The total market capitalization &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; behaves here as [[geometric Brownian motion]] with drift, and has the same constant growth rate as the largest stock; whereas the excess growth rate of the market
portfolio is a positive constant. On the other hand, the relative market weights &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt; have the dynamics of multi-allele [[Wright-Fisher model|Wright-Fisher processes]]. 
This model is an example of a non-diverse market with unbounded variances, in which strong arbitrage opportunities with respect to the market portfolio &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; exist over ''arbitrary time horizons'', as was shown by Banner and Fernholz (2008). Moreover, Pal (2012) derived the joint density of market weights at fixed times and at certain stopping times.

== Rank-based portfolios ==
We fix an integer &lt;math&gt;m \in \{2, \dots, n - 1\}&lt;/math&gt; and construct two capitalization-weighted portfolios: one consisting of the top &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; stocks, denoted &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt;, and one consisting of the bottom &lt;math&gt;n - m&lt;/math&gt; stocks, denoted &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;. More specifically,
:&lt;math&gt;
\zeta_i(t) = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^m \mu_{(k)}(t) \mathbf{1}_{\{\mu_i(t) = \mu_{(k)}(t)\}}}
{\sum_{l=1}^m \mu_{(l)}(t)}
\qquad \text{ and }
\eta_i(t) = \frac{\sum_{k=m+1}^n \mu_{(k)}(t) \mathbf{1}_{\{\mu_i(t) = \mu_{(k)}(t)\}}}
{\sum_{l=m+1}^n \mu_{(l)}(t)}
&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq n.&lt;/math&gt; Fernholz (1999), (2002) showed that the relative performance of the large-stock portfolio with respect to the market is given as
:&lt;math&gt;
\log\left(\frac{Z_\zeta(t)}{Z_\mu(t)}\right) 
= \log\left(\frac{\mu_{(1)}(T) + \cdots + \mu_{(m)}(T)}
{\mu_{(1)}(0) + \cdots + \mu_{(m)}(0)} \right) 
- \frac{1}{2}\int_0^T \frac{\mu_{(m)}(t)}{\mu_{(1)}(t) + \cdots + \mu_{(m)}(t)}
\,d\Lambda^{(m, m+1)}(t).
&lt;/math&gt;
Indeed, if there is no turnover at the mth rank during the interval &lt;math&gt;[0, T]&lt;/math&gt;, the fortunes of &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; relative
to the market are determined solely on the basis of how the total capitalization of this sub-universe
of the &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; largest stocks fares, at time &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; versus time 0; whenever there is turnover at the &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;-th rank,
though, &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; has to sell at a loss a stock that gets “relegated” to the lower league, and buy a stock
that has risen in value and been promoted. This accounts for the “leakage” that is evident in the
last term, an integral with respect to the cumulative turnover process &lt;math&gt;\Lambda^{(m,m+1)}&lt;/math&gt; of the relative weight in the large-cap portfolio &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; of the stock that occupies the mth rank.

The reverse situation prevails with the portfolio &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; of small stocks, which gets to sell at a profit stocks that are being promoted to the “upper capitalization” league, and buy relatively cheaply stocks that are being relegated:
:&lt;math&gt;
\log\left(\frac{Z_\eta(t)}{Z_\mu(t)}\right) 
= \log\left(\frac{\mu_{(m+1)}(T) + \cdots + \mu_{(n)}(T)}
{\mu_{(m+1)}(0) + \cdots + \mu_{(n)}(0)} \right) 
+ \frac{1}{2}\int_0^T \frac{\mu_{(m+1)}(t)}{\mu_{(m+1)}(t) 
+ \cdots + \mu_{(n)}(t)}.
&lt;/math&gt;
It is clear from these two expressions that, in a ''coherent'' and ''stochastically stable'' market, the small-
stock cap-weighted portfolio &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; will tend to outperform its large-stock counterpart &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;, at least over
large time horizons and; in particular, we have under those conditions
:&lt;math&gt;
\lim_{T\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1}{T} \log\left(\frac{Z_\eta(t)}{Z_\mu(t)}\right)
= \lambda^{(m, m+1)} \mathbb{E}
\left(
\frac{M_{(1)}}{M_{(1)} + \cdots + M_{(m)}}
+ \frac{M_{(m+1)}}{M_{(m+1)} + \cdots + M_{(n)}}
\right) &gt; 0.
&lt;/math&gt;
This quantifies the so-called '''size effect'''. In Fernholz (1999, 2002), constructions such as these are generalized to include functionally generated portfolios based on ranked market weights.

== First- and second-order models ==

First- and second-order models are hybrid Atlas models that reproduce some of the structure of real stock markets. First-order models have only rank-based parameters, and second-order models have both rank-based and name-based parameters.

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;X_1,\ldots,X_n&lt;/math&gt; is a coherent market, and that the limits

: &lt;math&gt;
 \mathbf{\sigma}_k^2 = \lim_{t\to\infty}
t^{-1}\langle\log\mu_{(k)}\rangle (t)
&lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{g}_k = \lim_{T\to\infty}\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T\sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{1}_{\{r_t(i)=k\}}\,d\log\mu_i(t)
&lt;/math&gt;

exist for &lt;math&gt;k=1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;r_t(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the rank of &lt;math&gt; X_i(t)&lt;/math&gt;. Then the  Atlas model &lt;math&gt;{\widehat X}_1,\ldots,{\widehat X}_n&lt;/math&gt; defined by

: &lt;math&gt;
d\log {\widehat X}_i(t) = \sum_{k=1}^n \mathbf{g}_k\,\mathbf{1}_{\{{\hat r}_t(i)=k\}}\,dt
+ \sum_{k=1}^n\mathbf{\sigma}_k \mathbf{1}_{\{{\hat r}_t(i)=k\}}\,dW_i(t),
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\hat r}_t(i)&lt;/math&gt; is the rank of &lt;math&gt;\widehat X_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(W_1,\ldots,W_n)&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional Brownian motion process, is the '''first-order model''' for the original market, &lt;math&gt;X_1,\ldots,X_n&lt;/math&gt;.

Under reasonable conditions, the capital distribution curve for a first-order model will be close to that of the original market. However, a first-order model is ergodic in the sense that each stock asymptotically spends   &lt;math&gt;(1/n)&lt;/math&gt;-th of its time at each rank, a property that is not present in actual markets. In order to vary the proportion of time that a stock spends at each rank, it is necessary to use some form of hybrid Atlas model with  parameters that depend on both rank and name. An effort in this direction was made by Fernholz, Ichiba, and Karatzas (2013), who introduced a '''second-order model''' for the market with rank- and name-based growth parameters, and variance parameters that depended  on rank alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3350">In [[philosophical logic]], '''supervaluationism''' is a [[Formal semantics (logic)|semantics]] for dealing with [[wikt:irreferential|irreferential]] [[singular term]]s and [[vagueness]].&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, Stewart, "Vagueness and Conversation" in {{cite book |last=Beall |first=Edited |title=Liars and Heaps |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford, England |year=2003 |isbn=0-19-926481-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows one to apply the [[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]] of [[propositional logic]] in cases where [[truth value|truth values]] are undefined.

According to supervaluationism, a proposition can have a definite truth value even when its components do not. The proposition "[[Pegasus]] likes [[licorice]]", for example, is often interpreted as having no truth-value given the assumption that the name "Pegasus" [[failure to refer|fails to refer]]. If indeed reference fails for "Pegasus", then it seems as though there is nothing that can justify an assignment of a truth-value to any apparent assertion in which the term "Pegasus" occurs. The statement "Pegasus likes licorice or Pegasus doesn't like licorice", however, is an instance of the valid schema &lt;math&gt;p \vee \neg p&lt;/math&gt; ("''&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; or not-&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;''"), so, according to supervaluationism, it should be true regardless of whether or not its [[Logical disjunction|disjuncts]] have a truth value; that is, it should be true in all interpretations. If, in general, something is true in all [[wikt:precisification|precisifications]], supervaluationism describes it as "supertrue", while something false in all precisifications is described as "superfalse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Supervaluation: Definition from Answers.com |work=Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2005 |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/supervaluation |accessdate=2012-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supervaluations'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; were first formalized by [[Bas van Fraassen]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-free/ Free Logic (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example abstraction ==
Let ''v'' be a [[Classical logic|classical]] valuation defined on every [[atomic sentence]] of the language ''L'' and let ''At(x)'' be the number of distinct atomic sentences in ''x''. There are then at most 2^''At(x)'' classical valuations defined on every sentence ''x''. A supervaluation ''V'' is a function from sentences to truth values such that ''x'' is supertrue (i.e. ''V(x)''=True) [[if and only if]] ''v(x)''=True for every ''v''. Likewise for superfalse.

''V(x)'' is undefined when there are exactly two valuations ''v'' and ''v''* such that ''v(x)''=True and ''v''*''(x)''=False. For example, let ''Lp'' be the formal translation of "Pegasus likes licorice". There are then exactly two classical valuations ''v'' and ''v''* on ''Lp'', namely ''v(Lp)''=True and ''v''*''(Lp)''=False. So ''Lp'' is neither supertrue nor superfalse.

[[File:Campanila S.Massimo.png|thumb|right|200px|The bell chamber in the campanile of San Massimo, [[Verona]]]]
'''Veronese bellringing art''' is a style of ringing [[church bell]]s that developed around [[Verona, Italy]] from the eighteenth century.  The bells are rung [[Full circle ringing|full circle]] (mouth uppermost to mouth uppermost), being held up by a rope and wheel until a note is required.

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:Verona Italy San Zeno DSC08194.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The campanile of San Zeno Maggiore]]
In ''The History of Verona'' Ludovico Moscardo records that on the 21 November 622 the bell towers of the city rang to announce the death of Bishop Mauro.  It is not known how many towers and bells, but clearly by that date Verona had a tradition of ringing.  In the following century the bell "the storm" ("dei temporali") was cast.  It is of octagonal shape and thought to be one of the oldest such castings in Europe.  It is now preserved in the San Zeno Museum in Verona.

The earliest technical information on the casting of Veronese bells is by the master{{efn|The Italian original uses both the terms "maestro" and "mastro" to describe master bellfounders.}} Gislimerio in 1149.  He described the casting of the bells for [[Basilica of San Zeno, Verona|San Zeno Maggiore]].  Gislimerio was the first of fifty bell founders which worked in Verona over the centuries. Initially the shape of the bells were empirical, however from around 1200 studies were done to determine the best shape.  The results were then shared across the continent. Other castings were made in 1065 for San Fermo, 1081 for San Massimo and 1172 for San Salvar.

Up until the 14th century the best bell founders were from [[Venice]], due to its more advanced industry, but there were skilled veronese founders too. Master Jacopo considered by some to be one of the best of the time.  In 1370 he cast the bell for the Gardello tower.  It is {{convert|130|cm}} wide and it weighs about 18 quintals or {{convert|1800|kg}} (35-2-24){{efn|cwt-qtr-lb, the usual way of measuring bell weights in the UK}}  The tower is a clock tower unattached to a church.  The 1370 clock was one of the first striking clocks in the world.  The bell is now in the Castelvecchio Museum.

In the 15th century when Verona was given to Venice there were few native Veronese foundry workers and therefore itinerant workmen worked for the Veronese masters. Bells for San Zeno were made by German workmen and that for the castle of Malcesine by Spaniards.  A Frenchman, Mr. Michel, started a company in Verona that continued until the 19th century.  He studied the sound of the bells, designing a shape which created a pleasant and tuneful sound.  His successors, such as Checcherle and Bonaventurini, continued the development and started to apply decorations making the bells into works of art. Particularly skilled founder was Gasparino which made in 1444 one bell for Santa Maria della Scala, still rung actually. In this century, wonderful belltowers were built up such as Santa Anastasia.

In the 16th century the number of bells in some towers increased. The first rings of five or six bells were in four churches: San Zeno, Santa Maria in Organo, Santa Maria della Scala and Santa Anastasia.  All four were monasteries where the monks rang the bells themselves. In 1557 the Bonaventurini foundry cast the {{convert|4215|kg}} (82-3-24) "Rengo" civic bell which is still in good condition today. Reinassence style belltowers are San Nazaro and Santa Maria in Organo.

During the 17th century the Da Levo family and their students (one of whom was Pesenti) were casting diatonically tuned bells. Common arrangements were the major chord (doh-me-soh-doh',{{efn|1=In eastern and southern Europe and in Spanish speaking countries do = C (known as fixed do).  In northern Europe and hence throughout the Commonwealth and the USA doh = the tonic (known as moveable doh).  In addition spellings vary, that used here is from the Royal Schools of Music.{{sfn|Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music|1958}}}} for example C E G C'), the Gloria (doh-ray-fah, for example C D F) or the subdominant (doh-far-doh', for example C F C').  Significant churches equipped installations were Madonna di Campagna, San Bernardino, San Nicolò and the Cathedral. At the latter the bell ringers were lay musicians living in the city western suburbs who were paid with a reduction in the rent of arable land. The first evidence of wheels and counterbalances dates from this period; from which it is supposed that the bells were starting to be rung in sequence, rather than swung randomly. The Da Levo family specialised in making small and medium size fully decorated bells. In 1653 Pesenti cast the {{convert|6000|kg}} (116-0-8) civic bell of Bergamo, which is still in use today. Pupils of Pesenti were De Rossi, Poni, Larducci and Micheletti (dead 1804).

In the mid-18th century another three interesting rings were installed. One was made by Crespi foundry for the Monastery of San Fermo, another by Antonio Larducci for Santa Lucia which was the last one made in the French-Veronese Renaissance style. In 1776 Professor Giuseppe Ruffini cast a ring for San Giorgio in Braida. Crespi and Ruffini introduced the "Manieristica" shape to Verona. This new shape had originated in the 16th century in the Alps and it became the basis for shapes still used today.  The San Giorgio in Braida bells are notable works of art both for decoration and musical precision.

===Development of Veronese style ringing===
[[File:Chiesa di San Giorgio in Braida.jpg|thumb|right|200px|San Giorgio in Braida, birthplace of the Veronese system of ringing]]
In [[San Giorgio in Braida]] the new bells were hung in such a way that the new style of ringing could develop.  The bells are hung for [[full circle ringing]] where each bell is swung from balanced mouth uppermost through 360 degrees to again balanced mouth uppermost.  This method of ringing permits a precise control of the time that the bell sounds and hence allows music.  It is not clear whether hanging the bells in this way was independently developed at San Giorgio or whether the method was imported from England where bells are also hung for full circle ringing.  Local farmers who attended church services and had an aptitude for music were chosen to ring and look after maintenance of the bells of San Giorgio.  They developed the art of ringing ''concerti''.  The new style of music was not appreciated by Holy Roman Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], but was loved by [[Pope Pius VI]] who listened to it in February 1782.

The ringers were paid for their efforts with food given to them at the start of autumn (fall): "polenta, salame e vino rosso" ([[polenta]], salami and red wine).  The ringing was quite onerous, on holy days they had to get up very early for the Ave Maria, then play again for the principal mass, the afternoon and evening service and finally at night for the vespers. They eventually used to sell the food, receiving an amount of about current 130 euro per year.

At around the same time the bells of [[Santa Maria in Organo, Verona|Santa Maria in Organo]] were modified, probably to allow them to play concerti.  Many of the churches of Verona started to follow this example and the original ringers of San Giorgio in Braida were sent to organize the bands and train the new players.

The next tower to be converted was [[Santissima Trinità, Verona|Santissima Trinità]] in 1803.  Next Chievo (1808) and then later the Cathedral, [[Santi Apostoli, Verona|Santi Apostoli]], [[Santo Stefano, Verona|Santo Stefano]], San Salvatore Corte Regia and [[Santa Anastasia, Verona|Santa Anastasia]]. The ringers at Santa Anastasia were a group who worked on the [[ship_mill|floating mills]] on the river [[Adige]], behind the apse of the basilica.  This demand for new bells led to four bell foundries, managed by the students of Ruffini: Partilora-Selegari, Chiappani and son, and the two Cavadini companies.

[[File:VeronaSAnastasiaDaCastSPietro.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Santa Anastasia]]
The only significant adverse effect was the extinction of the older technique of bell ringing as a Carillon. This tradition came from the masters like Vincenzi and Gardoni, some of whom decided to change technique by starting to ring the bells with their new method. An example is Giacomo Milossi (a student of Gardoni) whose skill was praised in a [[sonnet]] commemorating the bells of [[Santa Anastasia, Verona|Santa Anastasia]]. In 1820 the church group from Tomba arrived to give a [[peal]], followed by another wonderful peal in the bell tower of [[San Tomaso Becket, Quinzano e Parona, Verona|San Tomaso Becket, Quinzano e Parona]].

The priest at the Stimate brought together a band of ringers under the tutelage of Modesto Cainer.  Writing in his memoirs he describes the precise methods of playing a concert in rounds with the sacred bronze bell.&lt;ref name=Nicola&gt;{{harvnb|Nicola|Gardoni|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Partilora-Selegari foundry equipped the bell towers of San Lorenzo and San Massimo which were the first in the region to have eight bells, each of which required yet another ringing team.

In 1846 the Cavadini company installed a new ring in [[San Giovanni in Valle, Verona|San Giovanni in Valle]] and three years later in San Nazaro.  New groups of players were created which tried to compete with the ringers of San Giorgio.  At the same time the towers predisposed to the technique of playing in rounds had increased, for example San Michele, Santa Maria del Paradiso, San Paolo, Poiano e Avesa, each tower having new ringers' societies. In this period bellringers in the city centre were about 150, most of whom resided in the [[suburbs]].

The only remaining supplier of bells after 1850 was Luigi Cavadini, whose company continued until 1974. With the reconstruction of the biggest bell of [[Santissima Trinità, Verona|S. Trinità]], some young people from the area created a group of concert players which was then assorbed by San Giorgio, at the time directed by the Peroni brothers and Giacomo Tomasini.

The same thing happened to Molinari's group. In 1882 the bells of Scalzi and Santa Eufemia were increased in size and number.

===20th century===
In the church of Santa Maria della Scala a new group was started directed at first by Pietro Sancassani (1881–1972) and then by future maestros Alberti, Oliboni and Signorato. In 1902 in S. Rocco another peal was cast and another ringing society was born.

In 1903 a new bell tower installation was created in Cà di David, where for the inauguration there was the first competition of bell ringing.  This event was organized in a way so that all the teams of the city and also from the suburbs like Chievo and Santa Lucia, had to adhere to the oldest and most prestigious: San Giorgio in Braida.  The team of San Giorgio won the competition despite the allegation that the other teams cheated, this event started the rivalry between the city players and those of the province.

The San Bernardino Church acquired their bells in 1907.

[[File:Campanile San Tommaso Verona.JPG|thumb|left|200px|San Tomaso]]
In the 1914 some of the young ringers of San Giorgio decided to form their own group directed by Sancassani in Santo Stefano and San Tommaso churches, giving themselves the name "Audace" (which means the "Brave").  Ten years later the players of San Giorgio and those of San Paolo united and renamed the group "Società Campanaria Santa Anastasia in Verona", as the tower increased the number of bells from 6 to 9. The new president was Mario Carregari (1911–1997). During this time, the Audace group was able to transfer to the Cathedral assuming the name of the church. At the same time as the first world war, they started a thirty-year rivalry between the two groups. The only un-warlike group was the Santi Apostoli who didn't last very long.

This rivalry had the positive effect of leading to further installations: San Leonardo, the imposing San Nicolò all'Arena, Filippini, San Luca, Misericordia, and the Cathedral.  The cathedral has nine bells in the major scale the biggest of which now weighs {{long ton||88|1|26}}.&lt;ref name=Bagley&gt;{{harvnb|Bagley|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The bell is the largest bell hung for full circle ringing in the world and with its {{convert|3|LT|abbr=on}} headstock the rotating mass is over {{convert|8|LT}}.&lt;ref name=Bagley/&gt;  The tower of San Tommaso all'Isolo was the first in the region to have ten bells.

The rivalry was all the more intense because in each team there were the most important men, directors, composers, players, maintenance workers, and experts in bells.  The battle was also fought with sheet music composition, creating new sounds, pauses, chords and triplets.  The company of the teacher Sancassani, more or less, was the winner of the long conflict, but the turbulent spirit of the Audace team didn't leave the members, even if there weren't any more young people. The arguments changed by the day: an unsuccessful competition, disagreement about the management of the money, a proposal made to the other team, a social office not renewed.  Every little thing created disagreement because the team was made up of players from San Michele, Tomba, Cà di David, Montorio and San Massimo.  From this society, managed by Accordini and Biondani, other groups were created: the Santo Stefano, the Santa Maria in Organo (called the "Rebel") and the team of Sabaini-S.Eufemia which stopped spontaneously.

During the second world war some of the Veronese bells were destroyed. When the players returned home they all decided to join together with the old San Giorgio team (now Santa Anastasia).  Fortunately they were able to give demonstrations in documentaries and exhibitions all over Italy and enjoy the popularity.  After the war they gave a bell ringing concert in Borgo Nuovo, Santa Toscana, Tombetta, Palazzina, Golosine, San Giuseppe fuori Le Mura and Borgo Trieste.

Since the fifties, modernity has taken control of Verona lifestyle and the society started to lose interest in church and in bellringing art. It was fashionable for priests to ring the bells electrically which prevented the players from continuing their tradition.  In 1983, the creation of a regional bell ringing association managed to gradually turn around the decline, but not in the city of Verona itself, where the downwards trend continued for another twenty years.

==Bellringing today==

In 1998 the ringing school of St. George was re-opened and in 2010 an event, that had always been dreamed of, took place.  The ringers of the city and the suburbs wanted to unite to create a single group (which was the project of M° Sancassani ninety years before), who apart from ringing decided to look together for new members and for a major publicization of the art.  A lot of energy was invested in historical, technical, scientific research and the restoring of disused bell towers.

The bell ringing community of Verona was completely revolutionised and things quickly got better. It was like the old time: churches were inspired to install other bells, because of this the smallest Veronese ring was created in San Carlo.  Even though imminent extinction had only just been avoided they had never seen such enthusiasm.

The old San Giorgio society which had been renamed Santa Anastasia after the first world war now incorporated other teams and changed the name to Scuola Campanaria Verona in S.Anastasia (Bellringing school of Verona based in S.Anastasia church).  
In the [[Veneto]] region there are about 2,500 bell ringers of the Veronese method, united in local teams, more than half of which are members of the "Associazone Suonatori di Campane a Systema Veronese" (ASCSV) or association of bell ringers of the Veronese method.&lt;ref name=Bagley/&gt;

Today new technologically advanced systems, allow the possibility of playing the bells both electrically and manually.
However many bell towers have not yet installed the new system and are obliged to continue to use the old electric only system.  The electric system needs very expensive maintenance and can damage the towers.

==Bells==
[[File:Maggiore Duomo Verona.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The great bell of the new ring in Verona Cathedral. Cast in 2003 it weighs 4566 kg and is the largest bell in the world hung for full circle ringing.]]
The bells are cast from 75% copper and 25% tin bell metal using traditional methods of a loam covered core and outer cope.  Complex decoration of a religious nature is applied to the mould.

The towers are tall with the bells installed at the top.  The bells may swing through the tower openings and the sound is much louder than enclosed bell chambers.  The clappers are wired on with a safety rope, a broken or detached clapper must not become a missile in the streets surrounding the tower.  A heavy counterbalanced headstock reduces the forces on the tower and leads to a slower turning bell.  The headstock carries a steel wheel with the rope attached at 3 o'clock rather than the higher 2 o'clock attachment in the English style.  No stays or sliders are supplied, the bell must be held at balance when not ringing.  The rope is steel which removes the problem of stretch when the bells are rung from ground floor ringing chambers.  Being less flexible than natural fibres the steel rope is attached to the wheel with a toggle mechanism rather than being led through a garter hole.  The rope is terminated in a natural hemp rope where it is handled.  The ropes are plain without the sally associated with English style hanging.&lt;ref name=Bagley/&gt;

Since the bells are called according to music, the ringers do not need to see each other as a circle.  The ropes fall therefore wherever is most convenient for the bell hangers.

==Performances==
Since there is no provision for the bells to be retained in the up position, each piece or ''concerto'' starts with the bells being raised.  The bells are either raised sequentially with each bell joining in the rounds in turn, or just pulled up all at once.

The ''Maestro'', or conductor, calls out each bell or bells to ring.  The Maestro does not handle a bell and will read from music.  They play slowly moving tunes, not the continuous [[change ringing]] of the English tradition.  The ''Maestro'' calls out the bells, including two and three bell chords.  Each bell uses whichever stroke is available, the ringers holding the bells on balance when not required.  The concerto ends with a flourish of chords.  Once the concerto is complete the bells are rung down all at the same time, sometimes with the ringers leaving the tower whilst the bells just sort themselves out.&lt;ref name=Bagley/&gt;

In [[software architecture]], '''Wright''' is an [[architecture description language]] developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Wright formalizes a software architecture in terms of concepts such as ''components'', ''connectors'', ''roles'', and ''ports''. The dynamic behavior of different ports of an individual component is described using the [[Communicating Sequential Processes]] (CSP) process algebra. The roles that different components interacting through a connector can take are also described using CSP. Due to the formal nature of the behavior descriptions, automatic checks of port/role compatibility, and overall system consistency can be performed.

Wright was principally developed by [[Robert Allen (computer scientist)|Robert Allen]] and [[David Garlan]].

'''Zoghman Mebkhout''' (born 1949&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.congreso.us.es/mebkhout60/php/foto_index.htm ''Conference on D-modules in Honor of Zoghman Mebkhout´s 60th Birthday''.]
January 26–29, 2009. Seville (Spain)&lt;/ref&gt; ) (مبخوت زغمان) is a [[France|French]]-[[Algeria]]n mathematician known for his work in [[algebraic analysis]], [[geometry]], and [[representation theory]], more precisely on the theory of [[D-module]]s.

Zoghman is one of the first modern international-caliber North-African mathematicians, a symposium in Spain having been held on his sixtieth birthday, he was also invited to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] on two occasions.

[[Alexander Grothendieck]] writes on page 106 of "Récoltes et Sémailles":&lt;ref name="grothen"/&gt;
:''La "version Mebkhout" dont j’ai voulu me faire l’interprète, me semble consister pour l’essentiel en les deux thèses que voici: 1. Entre 1972 et 1979, Mebkhout aurait été seul, dans l’indifférence générale et en s’inspirant de mon oeuvre, à développer la "philosophie des D -Modules", en tant que nouvelle théorie des "coefficients cohomologiques" en mon sens. 2. Il y aurait eu un consensus unanime, tant en France qu’au niveau international, pour escamoter son nom et son rôle dans cette théorie nouvelle, une fois que sa portée a commencé à être reconnue. [...] Je viens d’avoir connaissance de plusieurs faits nouveaux, qui montrent qu’il y a lieu de nuancer fortement le point 1 ci-dessus.''

Grothendieck says that Mebkhout's name was hidden and his role neglected for a theory Zoghman was the first to develop.

Zoghman Mebkhout is currently a research director at the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institut.math.jussieu.fr/membres/liste2.php?equipe=TGE Institut de mathématiques de Jussieu]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 Zoghman received the Servant Medal from the CNRS.

==Notable works==
Zoghman Mebkhout proved in September 1979 the [[Riemann–Hilbert correspondence]],&lt;ref&gt;Z. Mebkhout, ''Sur le probleme de Hilbert–Riemann'', Lecture Notes in Physics 129 (1980) 99–110.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a generalization of [[Hilbert's twenty-first problem]] to higher dimensions.  The original setting was for [[Riemann surface]]s, where it was about the existence of [[regular differential equation]]s with prescribed [[monodromy group]]s.  In higher dimensions, Riemann surfaces are replaced by [[complex manifold]]s of dimension&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, and there is a correspondence between certain systems of [[partial differential equation]]s (linear and having very special properties for their solutions) and possible monodromies of their solutions.
See http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980LNP...126...90M
The result was also proved independently by [[Masaki Kashiwara]] 8 months later in April 1980. See [http://archive.numdam.org/ARCHIVE/SEDP/SEDP_1979-1980___/SEDP_1979-1980____A20_0/SEDP_1979-1980____A20_0.pdf "''Faisceaux constructibles et systemes holonomes d'équations aux derivées partielles linéaires à points singuliers réguliers Se. Goulaouic-Schwartz, 1979–80, Exp. 19.''] &lt;ref&gt;M. Kashiwara&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoghman is now largely known as a specialist in D-modules theory.&lt;ref name="grothen"&gt;Alexander Grothendieck, [http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/RetS.pdf "''Récoltes et sémailles'', ''Réflexions et témoignage sur un passé de mathématicien.''"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013193408/http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/RetS.pdf |date=October 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
