'''''A World Lit Only by Fire''''' (subtitled '''''The Medieval Mind and the Renaissance: Portrait of an Age''''') is an informal history of the European [[Middle Ages]] by American historian [[William Manchester]]. Published in 1992, the book is divided into three sections: "The Medieval Mind", "The Shattering", and "One Man Alone".  In the book, Manchester scathingly posits, as the title suggests, that the Middle Ages were ten centuries of technological stagnation, short-sightedness, bloodshed, [[feudalism]], and an oppressive Church wedged between the golden ages of the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Renaissance]].

==Contents==
In the book's "Author's Note", Manchester says, "It is, after all, a slight work, with no scholarly pretensions. All the sources are secondary, and few are new; I have not mastered recent scholarship on the early sixteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130718003851/http://www.ahshistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/A-WORLD-LIT-ONLY-BY-FIRE.pdf Manchester, William. "Author's Note", ''A World Lit Only By Fire'']&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Medieval Mind" extensively covers notable occurrences centered in approximately the year 500, including a description of the fall of the Roman Empire. The book further delineates the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] that immediately followed the collapse of the Roman Empire, including details regarding a number of adverse events that were characteristic of what Manchester regards as a "stark" era. It includes commentary on [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and the effects he had on medieval civilization. It talks about the overall ignorance of the masses during this time period.

The second section of the book, "The Shattering", is the book's longest section, expanding upon a number of events that Manchester regards as embodying the end of the Middle Ages as well as the early period of the Renaissance. It relates extensive anecdotes regarding a pope from the formidable medieval [[House of Borgia|Borgia]] family, [[Pope Alexander VI]], focusing on his "wild" celebrations and extensive nepotism. Continuing with his focus in regard to spirituality, Manchester writes on the rise of [[humanism]] in the early Renaissance days and its celebration of secularism over piety.  The section further covers humanist scholars, and concentrates upon the humanist tendencies of Renaissance leaders such as [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]. The European nobility of the era are also touched upon in chapters elaborately describing the life and decisions made by England's King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. [[Wives of Henry VIII|Henry's wives]] and eventual separation from the Church despite his being once an "ardent Catholic" are treated extensively.

The final section of the work, "One Man Alone", is a description of the voyage of the Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the globe. The section expands upon the life and personality of Magellan and his eventual death in the [[Philippines]] in an attempt to convert the natives to Catholicism there. Manchester's argument is ultimately that Magellan's voyage was concurrent with and, on several levels, symptomatic of changing ways in which Renaissance people thought.

==Reception==
''A World Lit Only by Fire'' became a [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller]] and was praised for its lively storytelling in some journalistic reviews. Ron Grossman of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', for instance, wrote that "by taking readers along on Magellan's voyage, Manchester provides them with easy access to a fascinating age when our modern mentality was just being born."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Ron|title= A Look at the Day the Middle Ages Ended|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-06-24/features/9202250679_1_nicolaus-copernicus-catholic-camps-voyage|work=Chicago Tribune|date=1992-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Some professional historians, however, have dismissed or ignored the book because of accusations regarding numerous factual errors and its dependence on interpretations that have not been accepted by experts since the 1930s at the latest. In a review for ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'', the journal of the [[Medieval Academy of America]], Jeremy duQuesnay Adams remarked that Manchester’s work contained "some of the most gratuitous errors of fact and eccentricities of judgment this reviewer has read (or heard) in quite some time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Jeremy duQuesnay|title=Review of William Manchester, A World Lit Only By Fire|journal=Speculum|date=January 1995|volume=70|issue=1|pages=173–74|doi=10.2307/2864746}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, Adams pointed out that Manchester's claims about diet, clothing, and medieval people's views of time and their sense of self all ran counter to the conclusions of 20th-century historians of the Middle Ages. Manchester’s views on the transition from medieval to modern civilization, though they were popular in the 19th and early 20th century (and still are current in some segments of contemporary culture), have long been rejected by professional scholars in the relevant fields. Despite this, the book is often taught at the beginning of [[College Board]]'s [[AP European History]] class.&lt;ref&gt;The book is one of several choices recommended as summer reading in {{cite web|last1=Mercado|first1=Steven|last2=Young|first2=Jessica|title=AP European History: Teacher's Guide|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/members/repository/ap07_eurohist_teachersguide.pdf|publisher=College Board Advanced Placement Program|date=2007|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the English [[industrial metal]] band [[Godflesh]] released an [[A World Lit Only by Fire (album)|album named after Manchester's book]].&lt;ref name="bmtitle"&gt;{{cite web |title=Godflesh: Entire 'A World Lit Only by Fire' Album Available for Streaming |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/godflesh-entire-a-world-lit-only-by-fire-album-available-for-streaming/ |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frontman [[Justin Broadrick]] found the brutality and bleakness of ''A World Lit Only by Fire'' inspiring.&lt;ref name="bmtitle" /&gt;

'''Adina Emilia De Zavala''' (November 28, 1861 – March 1, 1955) was an American teacher, historian and preservationist of Texas history. Her efforts led to saving the Alamo Long Barrack Fortress for future generations. She was born to Augustine De Zavala (originally de Zavala),&lt;ref name="Adina Emilia De Zavala"&gt;{{Handbook of Texas |author=Abels, L Robert | name=Adina Emilia De Zavala| id=fzafg|  retrieved=June 11, 2010}} Texas State Historical Association&lt;/ref&gt; son of [[Lorenzo de Zavala]], the first Vice President of the [[Republic of Texas]].  Adina's mother Julia Tyrrell De Zavala was born in Ireland. In 1994, [[Recorded Texas Historic Landmark]] Marker number 86 was placed at Alamo Plaza to honor De Zavala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marker Adina De Zavala|url=http://www.9key.com/markers/marker_detail.asp?atlas_number=5029000086&amp;search_term=de+zavala|work=Texas Historic Marker|publisher=Key9|accessdate=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008, Texas Historical marker number 15124 was placed in St. Mary's Cemetery to honor De Zavala's contributions to Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Mary's Cemetery historical marker|url=http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/viewform.asp?atlas_num=5507015124&amp;site_name=de%20Zavala%2C%20Adina&amp;class=5000|work=Recorded Texas Historic Landmark|publisher=Texas Historical Commission|accessdate=April 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family background and education ==

Adina's father Augustine De Zavala was a farmer who joined the [[Confederate States Navy]].  According to historian L. Robert Ables,&lt;ref&gt;L. Robert Ables, "The Second Battle for the Alamo," Southwestern Historical Quarterly 70 (1967): 373.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adina De Zavala and the Second Siege of the Alamo"/&gt; Adina was a [[eye color#Blue|blue-eyed]]  [[brown hair|brunette]] Hispanic, about 5 feet 3&amp;nbsp;inches tall.  Growing up in a mixed heritage household, she never learned to speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]].   Her mother Julia Tyrell De Zavala had been born in [[Ireland]] but educated in Texas.   Augustine's mother, Adina's grandmother, was Emily West&lt;ref name="Emily West de Zavala"&gt;{{Handbook of Texas |author=Henson, Margaret Swett | name=Emily West de Zavala| id=fza08|  retrieved=June 10, 2010}} Texas State Historical Association&lt;/ref&gt; of [[New York (state)|New York]]. Emily outlived three husbands, giving Augustine two non-[[Tejano]] step fathers, [[Germans|German]] immigrant Henry M. Fock&lt;ref name="The Annotated Statutes, Civil And Criminal, Of The State Of Texas (1889)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayles|first=John|title=The Annotated Statutes, Civil And Criminal, Of The State Of Texas (1889)|year=2010|publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC |isbn=978-1-160-02761-8|pages=170|author2=Sayles, Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sawmill owner E.D. Hand.  Circa 1873, the De Zavala family moved to near Locke Hill, 12 miles north of downtown San Antonio.  Augustine, died in 1893 and Julia managed the family's property holdings while living with her children.

De Zavala related for a 1935 ''[[Holland's Magazine]]''&lt;ref name="Holland's Magazine"&gt;{{Handbook of Texas |author=Collins, Karen | name=Holland's Magazine| id=edh01|  retrieved=June 11, 2010}} Texas State Historical Association&lt;/ref&gt; interview that history and mythology were favorite themes in her childhood books, and that she and her sister produced historical plays.  She described herself as a ''"jealous lover of Texas history."''&lt;ref name="A Line in the Sand: The Alamo in Blood and Memory"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Randy|title=A Line in the Sand: The Alamo in Blood and Memory |year=2002|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0-7432-1233-5|pages=197, 198, 206–229, 270, 310, 316, 337–351|author2=Olson|editor=James S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adina was home schooled until 1871 when she was enrolled in Ursuline Academy&lt;ref name="The Ursuline Academy at Galveston"&gt;{{Handbook of Texas |author=Kleiner, Diana J | name=The Ursuline Academy at Galveston| id=iwu01|  retrieved=June 11, 2010}} Texas State Historical Association&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]].   From 1879 to 1881, Adina was enrolled in Sam Houston Normal Institute (now [[Sam Houston State University]]) in [[Huntsville, Texas]].  She also received a  music education from a school in &lt;ref name="The Mexican American Experience: An Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meier|first=Matt S|title=The Mexican American Experience: An Encyclopedia|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-313-31643-2|author2=Gutierrez, Margo|page=435}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Chillicothe, Missouri]].  Adina became a teacher in [[Terrell, Texas]] from 1884 to 1886.  In 1887, she joined family members who had moved to San Antonio, where she taught at elementary schools until 1907, emphasizing education about Texas heritage.

== Career==

Adina De Zavala was a prolific writer,&lt;ref name="Adina De Zavala-Alamo Crusader"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jennings|first=Frank W|author2=Williams, Rosemary|title=Adina De Zavala-Alamo Crusader|journal=Texas Highways |year=1995 |pages=14–21 |url=http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/adp/history/bios/zavala/zavala.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Texas history.  In 1900, she wrote the  playlet, ''The Six National Flags That Have Floated Over Texas'', as an educational tool about the ethnic diversity in the state.

She authored  ''History and Legends of the Alamo and Other Missions In and Around San Antonio''&lt;ref name="History and Legends of the Alamo: And Other Missions in and Around San Antonio"&gt;{{cite book|last=De Zavala|first=Adina|title=History and Legends of the Alamo: And Other Missions in and Around San Antonio |origyear=1917|year=2010|publisher=original-City of San Antonio, reprint-Nabu Press|isbn=978-1-146-60386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1917, a perspective that highlights the role of women and other minorities in the history of both the Alamo and Texas.  De Zavala's 1916 ''Legend of the First Christmas at the Alamo (The Margil Vine)''&lt;ref name="Noche Buena: Hispanic American Christmas Stories"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kanellos|first=Nicolas|title=Noche Buena: Hispanic American Christmas Stories |year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513527-5|pages=104–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; relates the lore of the [[Franciscan monk]]s and local Indians celebrating the birth of [[Jesus Christ]] in the year 1718.  In 1934, Adina wrote ''In My Grandmother's Old Garden Where the Rose Reigned as Queen''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pickens|first=Mary Ann|title=Adina De Zavala – In Search of a Garden|journal=Magnolia|issue=Fall 2004|url=http://www.southerngardenhistory.org/PDF/Magnolia-Fall%2004.pdf|publisher=Southern Garden History Society|access-date=June 11, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100120070226/http://www.southerngardenhistory.org/PDF/Magnolia-Fall%2004.pdf|archive-date=January 20, 2010|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="In Search of Lost Roses"&gt;{{cite book|last=Christopher|first=Thomas|title=In Search of Lost Roses |year=2002|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-10596-3|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the ''[[San Antonio Express-News|San Antonio Express]]'', remembering all the beautiful flowers in her grandmother's garden, especially her grandmother's favorite, the rose, and encouraging readers to plant roses to commemorate the 1936 centennial celebration.

In 1951, she donated most of her large collection of documents pertaining to preservation and the De Zavala family history, to the [[University of Texas at Austin]],&lt;ref name="A Guide to the Adina Emilia De Zavala Papers, 1766 (1831-1955)"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to the Adina Emilia De Zavala Papers, 1766 (1831–1955) |url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utcah/00218/cah-00218.html|publisher=UT-Texas Austin|accessdate=June 11, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100626100527/http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utcah/00218/cah-00218.html| archivedate= June 26, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is used today by scholars at The [[Dolph Briscoe]] Center for American History.  The remainder of her papers were bequeathed to the [[University of the Incarnate Word]] in San Antonio,&lt;ref name="Adina De Zavala Archival Collection"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adina De Zavala Archival Collection|url=http://www.uiw.edu/gradcat/07.html#facilities|publisher=University of the Incarnate Word|accessdate=June 11, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100527131509/http://www.uiw.edu/gradcat/07.html| archivedate= May 27, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which houses the collection on the second floor of its library.

==Historical preservation affiliations==

Adina De Zavala was a proponent of a March 2 statewide recognition of [[Texas Independence Day]],&lt;ref name="Inherit the Alamo: Myth and Ritual at an American Shrine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brear|first=Holly Beachley|title=Inherit the Alamo: Myth and Ritual at an American Shrine|year=2008|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-71874-6 |pages=89–100, 129, 140, 165, 177–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was instrumental in Texas public schools being named for state heroes.  She was on the executive council of the [[Texas State Historical Association]], and in 1945 was voted an honorary life fellow of the council.

De Zavala interested her schoolteacher friend Anna Ellis, one of the founders of the [[San Antonio Conservation Society]],&lt;ref name="The San Antonio Conservation Society"&gt;{{Handbook of Texas |author= | name=The San Antonio Conservation Society| id=gas01|  retrieved=June 10, 2010}} Texas State Historical Association&lt;/ref&gt; in restoring homes representative of the six governments that had flown flags over Texas: [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Mexico]], the [[Republic of Texas]], the [[United States]], and the [[Confederate States of America]].  De Zavala worked in coordination with Anna Ellis, Elizabeth O. Graham and others in the society to help save the [[Spanish Governor's Palace]]&lt;ref name="Saving San Antonio: The Precarious Preservation of a Heritage"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=Lewis F|title=Saving San Antonio: The Precarious Preservation of a Heritage |year=1996|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|isbn=978-0-89672-372-6|pages=2,44–98,107–153,200,277,362,501,517,518,530|author2=Fehrenbach, T R}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="A Marmac Guide to San Antonio"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerem|first=Yves|title=A Marmac Guide to San Antonio|year=2001|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=978-1-56554-821-3|pages=186, 258}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several other structures, including the cluster of houses once lived in by [[Texas Declaration of Independence|Texas Declaration of Independence signer]] &lt;ref name="José Antonio Navarro"&gt;{{cite web|title=José Antonio Navarro |url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/treasures/giants/navarro/navarro-01.html|publisher=Texas State Library and Archives Commission|accessdate=June 11, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100725233652/http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/treasures/giants/navarro/navarro-01.html| archivedate= July 25, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[José Antonio Navarro]].  On March 2, 1951, the San Antonio Conservation Society presented De Zavala with an award for ''"marking historic homes and sites."''

Shortly after Adina came to [[San Antonio]] in 1887, she formed the "De Zavala Daughters"&lt;ref name="Decolonial Voices: Chicana and Chicano Cultural Studies in the 21st Century"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aldamo|first=Arturo J|title=Decolonial Voices: Chicana and Chicano Cultural Studies in the 21st Century  |year=2002 |publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-21492-8|pages=370, 371|author2=Quinonez, Naomi}}&lt;/ref&gt; organization dedicated to preserving  and marking Texas history. In 1893, the organization changed its name and became a chapter of the [[Daughters of the Republic of Texas]] (DRT).  One of the first markers in 1897 was over the grave of [[Ben Milam]]&lt;ref name="Final Resting Place-Benjamin Rush Milam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Resting Place-Benjamin Rush Milam |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=milam&amp;GSfn=ben&amp;GSbyrel=in&amp;GSdyrel=in&amp;GSst=46&amp;GScnty=2534&amp;GScntry=4&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=11695&amp;|publisher=Find A Grave|accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had died in 1835 while leading volunteers against [[Mexico|Mexican]] troops quartered in San Antonio.

In 1900, the De Zavala chapter formed Auxiliary, De Zavala Chapter, Daughters of the Republic of Texas for those who were not eligible to join the regular DRT.  In 1910, the auxiliary legally severed itself from the DRT and became an independent organization,&lt;ref name="Adina Emilia De Zavala"/&gt; with chapters in [[Crockett, Texas|Crockett]], [[Refugio, Texas|Refugio]], [[New Braunfels, Texas|New Braunfels]], [[San Patricio, Texas|San Patricio]] and [[Goliad, Texas|Goliad]].  Between 1922 and 1935, the association researched and marked 28 historic sites in San Antonio and 10 elsewhere in the state.  The organization disbanded when De Zavala died in 1955.

By the late 1880s, the historic San Antonio missions were falling into disrepair and becoming subject to vandals.  De Zavala's initial efforts were towards saving these historical structures, in particular the Mission San Antonio de Valero&lt;ref name="Defiance!

The public entrance known as the Alamo's mission chapel was already owned by the [[Texas|State of Texas]], which had purchased the building from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1883 and had given custody to the City of San Antonio.  The city had made no improvements to the chapel structure, and ownership did not include the long barracks, which was owned by wholesale grocer Gustav Schmeltzer.

These articles, in lieu of money, were to be used in repairing all the missions, the chapel of the Alamo included."''

The De Zavala chapter of the DRT in 1902 organized the Congress of Patriotism,&lt;ref name="Blessed with Tourists: The Borderlands of Religion and Tourism in San Antonio"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bremer|first=Thomas S|title=Blessed with Tourists: The Borderlands of Religion and Tourism in San Antonio |year=2003|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-2912-7|pages=53,54,70,84,163,166}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the aim of creating a "Texas Hall of Fame" museum in the Alamo long barracks (or convento).

She was notified in 1903 that the owners were considering a sale to a hotel syndicate.   De Zavala enlisted heiress and historical preservationist [[Clara Driscoll (philanthropist)|Clara Driscoll]] to put up financial backing for the purchase.  On January 26, 1905, [[S. W. T. Lanham|Governor S.W.T Lanham]] signed legislation for state funding to preserve the Alamo property. The state reimbursed Clara Driscoll and, on October 4, 1905, the governor formally conveyed the Alamo property, including the convento and the mission church, to the Daughters of the Republic of Texas.

A divide erupted between two factions of the DRT, and the general public as well, over how the long barracks property was to be used.  Driscoll and others&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Reeves to the San Antonio Business Men’s Club, August 30, 1906, De Zavala Papers&lt;/ref&gt;  believed it was not part of the original structure and should be turned into a park.  De Zavala was convinced the property was where the major portion of the historic battle had taken place.&lt;ref name="Behind the Scenes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Curtis|first=Gregory|title=Behind the Scenes|journal=Texas Monthly|date=February 1984|pages=5, 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In supporting research, Adina conducted numerous interviews with families and acquaintances of men who died in the Alamo.&lt;ref name="The Alamo Reader: A Study in History"&gt;{{cite book|last=Todd Hansen|title=The Alamo Reader: A Study in History |year=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=978-0-8117-0060-3|pages=60,90–96,128,186,207,323,570–571}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1906 she obtained an affidavit from Juan E. Barrera,&lt;ref&gt;Affidavit, Juan E. Barrera, 1906, De Zavala Papers&lt;/ref&gt; a San Antonio resident born in 1839, stating that the long barracks ''"are still standing just as they were when I was a boy."''

The building's lease was due to expire on February 10, 1908, and rumors floated that the property might next be rented to a vaudeville company.&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Express, January 27, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;  Two days before the expiration of the lease, Adina engaged three guards for the property and had a telephone installed in the rat-infested warehouse.  New padlocks were also installed.  On the evening of February 10, 1908, Sheriff John W. Tobin arrived with deputies in tow, an injunction barring De Zavala from interference, and assorted stakeholders of the outcome.  The guards were served with the injunction&lt;ref name="Adina De Zavala and the Second Siege of the Alamo"/&gt; and removed from the property.  De Zavala refused to listen to the injunction and shut herself away in an upstairs area, without any provisions to sustain herself.  While not trying to physically evict her, the sheriff  had the electricity and telephone cut and threatened to send anyone to jail who brought her food. Nevertheless, both food and extra clothing were smuggled in, and law enforcement allowed water and coffee.  Sheriff Tobin eventually had the electricity restored for lighting to keep the rats at bay.  The 46-year-old Adina stated she was willing to die&lt;ref&gt;Fort Worth Telegram, February 13, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;  for the cause.  The siege lasted three days&lt;ref name="Alamo Siege is Ended "&gt;{{cite news|title=Alamo Siege is Ended |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1908/02/14/104848769.pdf|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Angel of The Alamo - Remembering Adina De Zavala"&gt;{{cite web | title=Angel of The Alamo – Remembering Adina De Zavala | publisher=Texas Escapes – Blueprints For Travel, LLC. | author=Montgomery, Murray | url=http://www.texasescapes.com/MurrayMontgomeryLoneStarDiary/Savior-of-The-Alamo.htm | accessdate=June 11, 2010}} Texas Escapes – Blueprints For Travel, LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted spectators and newspaper coverage from around the country.

However, when Governor Colquitt left the state on business in 1913, De Zavala's efforts were slighted when Lt Governor [[William Harding Mayes]] permitted the demolition of the upper-story walls of the long barracks.&lt;ref name=roberts214&gt;Roberts and Olson (2001), p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iDFd_1yaAdgC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;lpg=PA214&amp;dq=william+harding+mayes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MBYQCC3QbC&amp;sig=pkfC4uKsSAItWubb3A7NG5PJCNA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gzXsVPGHA8OgNuWsgsgJ&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwDg#v=onepage&amp;q=william%20harding%20mayes&amp;f=false A Line in the Sand p. 214]&lt;/ref&gt;

De Zavala is buried in her family's plot in St. Mary's Cemetery. She never married and willed her estate to the [[Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word]] to establish a girl's vocational school and a boys town.

On April 27, 1955, the [[Texas State Legislature]] passed Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 51&lt;ref&gt;Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 51, April 27, 1955, New Gresham Library Special Collections&lt;/ref&gt;  paying tribute to her for playing ''"a major role in preserving the Alamo and the Spanish Governor's Palace"'' and for placing ''"permanent markers on some 40 historic sites in Texas, many of which might otherwise be forgotten."''

In 1994 the Daughters of the Republic of Texas dedicated a special Commemorative Marker&lt;ref name="Final Resting Place-Adina De Zavala"&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Resting Place-Adina De Zavala|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=de+zavala&amp;GSbyrel=in&amp;GSdyrel=in&amp;GSst=46&amp;GScntry=4&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=10365039&amp;|publisher=Find a Grave|accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; at her gravesite.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10477">[[Image:Celsus-Bibliothek2.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Celsus Library]] in [[Ephesus]] ([[Turkey]]), anastylosis carried out 1970–1978]]
'''Anastylosis''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|αναστήλωσις, -εως}}; {{lang|grc|ανα}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|ana}} = "again", and {{lang|grc|στηλόω}}&lt;!-- or styloo--&gt; = "to erect [a stela &lt;!-- or stylos--&gt; or building]") is an [[archaeological]] term for a reconstruction technique whereby a ruined building or monument is restored using the original architectural elements to the greatest degree possible. It is also sometimes used to refer to a similar technique for restoring broken pottery and other small objects.

== Methodology ==
The intent of anastylosis is to rebuild, from as much of the original materials that is left after usually thousands of years of abuse, historical architectural monuments which have fallen into ruin. This is done by placing components back into their original positions. Where standing buildings are at risk of collapse, the method may entail the preparation of drawings and measurements, piece-by-piece disassembly, and careful reassembly, with new materials as required for structural integrity; occasionally this may include new foundations. When elements or parts are missing, modern materials (of restoration grade) may be substituted, such as [[plaster]], [[cement]], and synthetic [[resin]]s.

The international [[Venice Charter]] of 1964 details criteria for anastylosis. First, the original condition of the structure must be confirmed scientifically. Second, the proper placement of each recovered component must be determined. Third, supplemental components must be limited to those necessary for stability (that is, substitute components may never lie at the top), and must be recognizable as replacement materials. New construction for the sake of filling in apparent lacunae is not allowed.

== Criticism ==
Anastylosis has its detractors in the scientific community. In effect, the method poses several problems:
* No matter how rigorous preparatory studies are, any errors of interpretation will result in errors, often undetectable or incorrigible, in reconstruction.
* Damage to the original components is practically inevitable.
* An element may be, or may have been reused in, or may have originated in, different buildings or monuments from different periods. To use it in one reconstruction obviates its use in others.

== Examples ==
===Greece===
[[File:Anastylose Evans Cnossos 1.jpg|thumb|200px|Anastylosis in [[Knossos]] palace, Crete, Greece, by [[Arthur Evans]]]]
A primitive anastylosis was carried out in 1836 at the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]] in [[Athens]], where the [[Temple of Athena Nike]] was re-erected from remaining parts. Starting in 1902, the Greek architect Nikolas Balanos used anastylosis in order to restore a collapsed portion of the [[Parthenon]], restore the [[Erechtheion]], and rebuild the Nike Temple a second time. Iron clamps and plugs which had been used earlier had started to rust and had caused heavy damage to the original structure. These were removed and replaced with precious metal clamps. When the temple was once again rebuilt additional newly identified original fragments were added. Currently, anastylosis is being applied to the Parthenon.

===India===
Several monuments protected by [[Archeological Survey of India]] have been restored, including [[Shekhavati]] [[haveli]]s, [[Humayun's Tomb]], etc.

===Indonesia===
[[File:The Borobudur in Java, Indonesia.jpg|200px|thumb|One of the earlier examples of anastylosis: the [[Borobudur]] in [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Indonesia]]]]
Early in the 20th century, Dutch archaeologists carried out anastylosis of the [[stupa]] at the [[Buddhist]] temple complex at [[Borobudur]] in Java, [[Indonesia]] between 1907 and 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=zCQlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA319&amp;lpg=PA319&amp;dq=anastylosis+Borobudur&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R8cfiLo3gr&amp;sig=QolFH5HIJqWT7cqoPooQ_NlfusM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0ibq46efZAhUMnpQKHYEyAr8Q6AEIWjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=anastylosis%20Borobudur&amp;f=false|title=Architectural Conservation in Asia: National Experiences and Practice|last=Stubbs|first=John H.|last2=Thomson|first2=Robert G.|date=2016-11-10|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781317406198|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prambanan]] Hindu temple complex was excavated and was partially reconstructed between 1911 and 1953, also reconstructed using anastylosis method. The recent practice of anastylosis in Indonesia is the reconstruction of [[Kedulan]] temple, built in 869, the temple was buried under volcanic layers for centuries, until was discovered in 1993. The restoration of the entire Kedulan Temple complex is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2018/02/15/kedulan-temple-restoration-enters-anastylosis-phase.html|title=Kedulan Temple restoration enters anastylosis phase|last=Ajie|first=Stefanus|date=17 February 2018|work=The Jakarta Post|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambodia===
The [[École Française d'Extrême-Orient]] (EFEO) began restoration work at [[Angkor Wat]] in 1908. Between 1986 and 1992, the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) carried out restoration work on the temple. [[Bayon]] was restored by EFCO followed by Japanese Government Team for the Safeguarding of Angkor (JSA). [[Ta Prohm]] is being restored by [[Archaeological Survey of India]].

==Proposals==
The [[Buddhas of Bamyan]] in [[Afghanistan]] which were destroyed by the [[Taliban]] in 2001 is under consideration for anastylosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Petzet|first1=Michael|title=Anastylosis or reconstruction – the conservation concept for the remains of the Buddhas of Bamiyan|url=http://www.icomos.org/madrid2002/actas/189.pdf|website=International Council on Monuments and Sites|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327142510/http://www.icomos.org/madrid2002/actas/189.pdf|archivedate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have estimated that as much as 50% of the statues' material is recoverable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9049">'''Astrolatry''' is the worship of [[stars]] and other  [[heavenly body|heavenly bodies]] as [[deity|deities]], or the association of deities with heavenly bodies.
The most common instances of this are [[sun god]]s and [[moon god]]s in polytheistic systems worldwide. Also notable is the association of the [[planet]]s with deities in [[Babylonian religion|Babylonian]], and hence in Greco-Roman religion, viz. [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]].

The term '''astro-theology''' is used in the context of 18th- to 19th-century scholarship aiming at the discovery of the [[Urreligion|original religion]], particularly [[Urmonotheismus|primitive monotheism]]. Unlike ''astrolatry'', which usually implies [[polytheism]], frowned upon as [[idolatry|idolatrous]] by Christian authors since [[Eusebius]], astrotheology is any "religious system founded upon the observation of the heavens",&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'', citing Derham (1714) as the first attestation of the term.&lt;/ref&gt;   and in particular, may be [[monotheism|monotheistic]]. Gods, goddesses, and demons may also be considered personifications of astronomical phenomena such as lunar eclipses, planetary alignments, and apparent interactions of planetary bodies with stars. '''Astro-theology''' is used by Jan Irvin, [[Jordan Maxwell]] and Andrew Rutajit (2006) in reference to "the earliest known forms of religion and nature worship", advocating the [[entheogen]] theory of the [[origin of religion]].

==Etymology==
''Astrolatry'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἄστρον ''astron'', "star" and the suffix -λάτρης, itself related to [[wikt:λάτρις|λάτρις]] ''latris'', "worshipper" or λατρεύειν ''latreuein'', "to worship" from λάτρον ''latron'', "payment".

==History==
[[Babylonian astronomy]] from early times associates stars with deities, but the [[heaven]]s as the residence of an anthropomorphic pantheon, and later of monotheistic [[God]] and his retinue of angels, is a later development, gradually replacing the notion of the pantheon residing or convening on the summit of high mountains. Sayce (1913) argues a parallelism of the "stellar theology" of Babylon and Egypt, both countries absorbing popular star-worship into the official pantheon of their respective state religions by identification of gods with stars or planets.&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Henry Sayce, The religion of ancient Egypt, Adamant Media Corporation, 1913, 237f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrolatry does not appear to have been common in the [[Levant]] prior to the [[Iron Age]], and becomes popular under [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] influence.
The [[Sabaeans]] were notorious for their astrolatry, for which reason the practice is also known as "Sabaism" or "Sabaeanism".
Similarly, the [[Chaldea]]ns came to be seen as the prototypical astrologers and star-worshippers by the Greeks.

The term ''astro-theology'' appears in the title of a 1714 work by [[William Derham]],  ''Astro-theology: or, A demonstration of the being and attributes of God, from a survey of the heavens'' based on the author's observations by means of "Mr. [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]]' Glass". Derham thought that the stars were openings in the [[firmament]] through which he thought he saw the [[Empyrean]] beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Crowe, ''Modern theories of the universe: from Herschel to Hubble'', Courier Dover Publications, 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-486-27880-3}}, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1783 issue of ''The New Christian's magazine'' had an essay entitled ''Astro-theology'' which argued the "demonstration of sacred truths" from "a survey of heavenly bodies" in the sense of the [[watchmaker analogy]]. [[Edward Higginson]] (1855) argues a compatibility of "Jewish Astro-theology" of the [[Hebrew Bible]], which places God and his angelic hosts in the heavens, with a "Scientific Astro-theology" based on observation of the cosmos.

[[Manly P Hall]] (1901–1990), mystic and a [[33rd degree]] mason, taught that each of the  three Abrahamic faiths has a planet that governs that religion. Judaism is Saturn: the symbol of Judaism is a hexagram symbol of Saturn, and the day of worship is on Saturday, day of Saturn. Christianity is the Sun: the symbol of Christianity is the cross symbol of the Sun, and the day of worship is Sunday, day of the Sun. Islam is Venus: the symbol of Islam is the star and  crescent (the star commonly thought to represent Venus), and the day of worship is on Friday.

==Prohibition in Abrahamic religions==
The [[Hebrew Bible]] contains repeated reference to astrolatry. Thus, Deuteronomy 4:19, 17:3 contains a stern warning against worshipping the sun, moon, stars or any of the [[heavenly host]]. Relapse into worshipping the host of heaven, i.e. the stars, is said to have been the cause of the fall of the [[kingdom of Judah]] in II Kings 17:16. King [[Josiah]] in 621 BC is recorded as having abolished all kinds of [[idolatry]] in Judah, but astrolatry was continued in private (Zeph. 1:5; Jer. 8:2, 19:13). [[Ezekiel]] (8:16) describes sun-worship practiced in the court of the temple of Jerusalem, and Jeremiah (44:17) claims that even after the destruction of the temple, women in particular insisted on continuing their worship of the "queen of heaven".

[[Augustine of Hippo]] criticized sun- and star-worship in ''De Vera Religione''  (37.68) and  ''De civitate Dei'' (5.1–8). Pope [[Leo the Great]] also denounced astrolatry, and the cult of ''[[Sol Invictus]]'', which he contrasted with the Christian nativity.

Despite such prohibitions, [[Dorothy M. Murdock]], a proponent of the study,&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Casey Jesus: Evidence and Argument or Mythicist Myths? T&amp;T Clark 2014 p21-22&lt;/ref&gt; has released books on the subject and teaches the connections between the solar allegory and the life of Christ. She also goes beyond the astronomical comparisons and postulates ties between the origins of many of the early Abrahamic religions to ancient mythologies of that in Egypt, Rome, and Greece.

The [[Qur'an]] contains strong prohibitions against astrolatry.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Strong prohibition of Astrolatry is mentioned in the Quran through Prophet Abrahim observation of celestial bodies whose worship was common in Babylonian religion of that time.

Below is the reference from Al-Quran, Surah Anaam, chapter 6, verses 75–80
 
75. Thus did we show Ibrahim (Abraham) the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he be one of those who have Faith with certainty.

76. When the night covered him over with darkness he saw a star. He said: "This is my lord." But when it set, he said: "I like not those that set."

77. When he saw the moon rising up, he said: "This is my lord." But when it set, he said: "Unless my Lord guides me, I shall surely be among the erring people."

78. When he saw the sun rising up, he said: "This is my lord. This is greater." But when it set, he said: "O my people! I am indeed free from all that you join as partners in worship with Allah.

79. Verily, I have turned my face towards Him Who has created the heavens and the earth Hanifa (Islamic Monotheism, i.e. worshipping none but Allah Alone) and I am not of Al-Mushrikun (see V.2:105)".

80. His people disputed with him. He said: "Do you dispute with me concerning Allah while He has guided me, and I fear not those whom you associate with Allah in worship. (Nothing can happen to me) except when my Lord (Allah) wills something. My Lord comprehends in His Knowledge all things. Will you not then remember?

Al-Quran, Surah Anaam (chapter 6, verse 75–80)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15279">[[File:Ironie pile Bagdad.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|Drawing of the three pieces]]
The '''Baghdad Battery''' or '''Parthian Battery''' is a set of three artifacts which were found together: a ceramic pot, a tube of copper, and a rod of iron. It was discovered in modern [[Khujut Rabu]], [[Iraq]], close to the metropolis of [[Ctesiphon]], the capital of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] (150 BC – 223 AD) and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] (224–650 AD) empires, and it is considered to date from either of these periods.

Its origin and purpose remain unclear, and further evidence is needed to explain its purpose. It was hypothesized by some researchers that the object functioned as a [[galvanic cell]], possibly used for [[electroplating]], or some kind of [[electrotherapy]], but there is no [[electrogilding|electrogilded]] object known from this period. An alternative explanation is that it functioned as a storage vessel for sacred [[scroll]]s.

== Physical description and dating ==
The artifacts consist of [[terracotta]] pots approximately {{convert|130|mm|in|abbr=on|0}} tall (with a one-and-a-half-inch mouth) containing a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] made of a rolled [[copper]] sheet, which houses a single [[iron]] rod. At the top, the iron rod is isolated from the copper by [[bitumen]], with plugs or stoppers, and both rod and cylinder fit snugly inside the opening of the jar. The copper cylinder is not watertight, so if the jar were filled with a liquid, this would surround the iron rod as well. The artifact had been exposed to the weather and had suffered corrosion.

König thought the objects might date to the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] period, between 250 BC and AD 224, but according to St John Simpson of the [[Ancient Near East|Near Eastern]] department of the [[British Museum]], their [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)|original excavation and context]] were not well-recorded, and evidence for this date range is very weak. Furthermore, the style of the pottery is [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] (224-640).&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref name=keyser /&gt;

{{cns|Most of the components of the objects are not particularly amenable to [[Archaeological science|advanced dating methods]]. The ceramic pots could be analysed by [[thermoluminescence dating]], but this has not yet been done;{{when|date=August 2018}} in any case, it would only date the firing of the pots, which is not necessarily that of the complete artifact.|date=August 2018}}

== Theories concerning operation ==
Its origin and purpose remain unclear.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; Wilhelm König was an assistant at the [[National Museum of Iraq]] in the 1930s. He had observed a number of very fine silver objects from ancient Iraq, plated with very thin layers of gold, and speculated that they were [[Electroplating|electroplated]]. In 1938 he authored a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|W. König, "Ein galvanisches Element aus der Partherzeit?", ''Forschungen und Fortschritte'', vol. 14 (1938), pp. 8-9.|W. König, ''Im Verlorenen Paradies-Neun Jahre Irak'', pp. 166-68, Munich and Vienna: 1939.}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering the hypothesis that they may have formed a [[galvanic cell]], perhaps used for [[electroplating]] [[gold]] onto [[silver]] objects.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2804257.stm |title=Riddle of 'Baghdad's batteries' |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=February 27, 2003 |accessdate=April 6, 2012 |author=Frood, Arran |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66jb0KoWa?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2804257.stm |archivedate=April 7, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is rejected by skeptics.&lt;ref name=badarch&gt;[http://www.badarchaeology.com/?page_id=208 Baghdad batteries] on the Bad Archaeology Network website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debunker.com/texts/vondanik.html "Erich von Däniken's Chariots of the Gods: Science or Charlatanism?"], [[Robert Sheaffer]]. First published in the "NICAP UFO Investigator", October/November, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe that wine, [[lemon juice]], [[grape juice]], or [[vinegar]] was used as an [[acid]]ic [[electrolyte]] solution to generate an [[electric current]] from the difference between the [[electrode potential]]s of the copper and iron [[electrode]]s.&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;&lt;ref name=keyser&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/545563 Paul T. Keyser, "The Purpose of the Parthian Galvanic Cells: A First-Century A. D. Electric Battery Used for Analgesia"], ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'', vol. 52, no. 2, pp. 81-98, April 1993. Includes images of the artifact and similar objects.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supporting experiments ===
After the [[Second World War]], a man named Willard Gray demonstrated [[current (electricity)|current]] production by a reconstruction of the inferred battery design when filled with [[grape juice]]. W. Jansen experimented with [[benzoquinone]] (some [[beetle]]s produce [[quinone]]s) and vinegar in a cell and got satisfactory performance.

In 1978, Arne Eggebrecht reportedly reproduced the electroplating of gold onto a small statue. There are no (direct) written or photographic records of this experiment. {{efn|In Arran Frood's BBC article: "There does not exist any written documentation of the experiments which took place here in 1978," says Dr Bettina Schmitz, currently a researcher based at the same Roemer and Pelizaeus Museum. "The experiments weren't even documented by photos, which really is a pity," she says. "I have searched through the archives of this museum and I talked to everyone involved in 1978 with no results."}} The only records are segments of a television show.

== Controversies over use ==
=== Battery hypothesis ===
The artifacts do not form a useful battery for several reasons:{{original research inline|date=August 2016}}
# Gas is evolved at an iron/copper/electrolyte junction. Bubbles form a partial insulation of the electrode. Thus the battery's functionality decreases the more it is used.
# Although several volts can be produced by connecting batteries in series, the voltage generated by iron/copper/electrolyte cell is below 1 volt.&lt;ref&gt;Welfare, S. and Fairley, J. ''Arthur C. Clarke's Mysteries'' (Collins 1980), pp. 62–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electroplating hypothesis ===
König himself seems to have been mistaken on the nature of the objects he thought were electroplated. They were apparently [[Gilding#Fire-gilding|fire-gilded]] (with [[mercury (element)|mercury]]). Paul Craddock of the [[British Museum]] said "The examples we see from this region and era are conventional gold plating and mercury gilding. There’s never been any irrefutable evidence to support the electroplating theory".&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

David A. Scott, senior scientist at the [[Getty Conservation Institute]] and head of its Museum Research Laboratory, wrote that "There is a natural tendency for writers dealing with chemical technology to envisage these unique ancient objects of two thousand years ago as electroplating accessories (Foley 1977). but this is clearly untenable, for there is absolutely no evidence for electroplating in this region at the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=David A.|title=Copper and Bronze in Art: Corrosion, Colorants, Conservation|date=2002|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yQKuSOzkLvcC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=bitumen+copper+cylinder+Khuyut+Rabbou|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=978-0-89236-638-5|pages=16–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul T. Keyser of the University of Alberta noted that Eggebrecht used a more efficient, modern electrolyte, and that using only vinegar, or other electrolytes available at the time assumed, the battery would be very feeble, and for that and other reasons concludes that even if this was in fact a battery, it could not have been used for electroplating.  However, Keyser still supported the battery theory, but believed it was used for some kind of mild [[electrotherapy]] such as pain relief, possibly through [[electroacupuncture]].&lt;ref name=keyser /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elizabeth Frood"&gt;[http://escholarship.org/uc/item/3945t7f7 Oxford University, Elizabeth Frood editor] (on eScholarship website): Eggebrecht's account&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bitumen as an insulator ===
A bitumen seal, being [[thermoplastic]], would be extremely inconvenient for a galvanic cell, which would require frequent topping up of the [[electrolyte]] (if they were intended for extended use).&lt;ref name=badarch /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theironskeptic.com/articles/battery/battery.htm the Baghdad Battery] on The Iron Skeptic website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.matrix.msu.edu/pseudoarchaeology/2010/10/12/the-baghdad-battery-and-ancient-electricity/ |title=The Baghdad Battery – and Ancient Electricity |publisher=[[Michigan State University]] students website |date=October 12, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2015 |archivedate=November 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109074955/http://sites.matrix.msu.edu/pseudoarchaeology/2010/10/12/the-baghdad-battery-and-ancient-electricity |deadurl=yes |df= }} MSU students cite the now offline SkepticWorld.com website article ([https://web.archive.org/web/20120116204622/http://www.skepticworld.com/ancient-artifacts/baghdad-battery.asp archived January 16, 2012]) and offer their viewpoint.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative hypothesis ===
The artifacts strongly resemble another type of object with a known purpose&amp;nbsp;– storage vessels for sacred [[scroll]]s from nearby [[Seleucia on the Tigris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.badarchaeology.com/out-of-place-artefacts/anomalously-old-technology/the-%E2%80%98batteries-of-babylon%E2%80%99/|title=The batteries of Babylon: evidence for ancient electricity?|work=Bad Archaeology|date=26 December 2009 | author= Keith Fitzpatrick-Matthews|accessdate=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these vessels were exposed to the elements,&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;{{efn|name=fn1|Arran Frood's BBC article: "The artifact had been exposed to the weather and had suffered corrosion, although mild given the presence of an [[electrochemical cell|electrochemical couple]].&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;}}{{Synthesis inline|date=August 2015}} it is possible that any [[papyrus]] or [[parchment]] inside had completely rotted away, perhaps leaving a trace of slightly acidic [[organic matter|organic]] residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/02/10/1361589/-The-Baghdad-Battery-An-Update#|title=The Baghdad Battery: An Update|work=Daily Kos|author=Lenny Flank|date=Feb 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The object was looted along with thousands of other artifacts from the National Museum during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref name=HiddenHistory&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fSbRZunGbF4C&amp;lpg=PA132|title=Hidden History: Lost Civilizations, Secret Knowledge, and Ancient Mysteries|first=Brian|last=Haughton|date=26 December 2006|publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Professor Elizabeth Stone of [[Stony Brook University]], an expert on Iraqi archaeology, returning from the first archaeological expedition in Iraq after 20 years, stated that she does not know a single archaeologist who believed that these were batteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|title=Archaeologists Revisit Iraq|accessdate=April 6, 2012|date=March 23, 2012|last=Stone|first=Elizabeth|interviewer=Flatow, Ira|work=Science Friday|url=http://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/archaeologists-revisit-iraq/|quote=My recollection of it is that most people don't think it was a battery. ...It resembled other clay vessels... used for rituals, in terms of having multiple mouths to it. I think it's not a battery. I think the people who argue it's a battery are not scientists, basically. I don't know anybody who thinks it's a real battery in the field.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Stone's statement, listed as a 'red flag' among [http://archyfantasies.wordpress.com/2012/06/22/the-10-most-not-so-puzzling-ancient-artifacts-the-baghdad-battery/ 5 red flags why it was not a battery] (with sources, on Archaeology Fantasies website)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
The idea that the terracotta jars in certain circumstances could have been used to produce usable levels of electricity has been put to the test at least twice. On the third episode of the 1980 British Television series ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World]]'', [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] Arne Eggebrecht created a voltaic cell using a jar filled with [[grape juice]], to produce half a [[volt]] of electricity, demonstrating for the programme that jars used this way could [[electroplating|electroplate]] a [[silver]] [[statuette]] in two hours, using a [[Gold cyanidation|gold cyanide solution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Docu BoX TR|title=Arthur C. Clarke Mysterious World S01 E03 "Ancient Wisdom" (video)|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1v2bwp|website=DailyMotion|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eggebrecht speculated that museums could contain many items mislabelled as gold when they are merely electroplated.&lt;ref name="FairleyWelfare2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Fairley|author2=Simon Welfare|title=Arthur C.

The [[Discovery Channel]] program ''[[MythBusters]]'' built replicas of the jars to see if it was indeed possible for them to have been used for electroplating or electrostimulation.  On ''MythBusters''{{'}} [[MythBusters (2005 season)#Baghdad Battery|29th episode]] (March 23, 2005), ten hand-made terracotta jars were fitted to act as batteries. [[Lemon juice]] was chosen as the [[electrolyte]] to activate the electrochemical reaction between the copper and iron. Connected in series, the batteries produced 4 [[volts]] of electricity. When linked in series, the cells had sufficient power to electroplate a small token and deliver a minor electric shock to ''MythBusters'' co-host [[Adam Savage]].&lt;ref name="mythbust"&gt;[http://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/mythbusters-database/ancient-batteries.htm Ancient batteries episode] on [[MythBusters]].&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist [[Ken Feder]] commented on the show noting that no archaeological evidence has been found either for connections between the jars (which were necessary to produce the required voltage) or for their use for electroplating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skeptic.com/podcasts/monstertalk/11/07/27/transcript/|title=Ancient Alien Astronauts: Interview with Ken Feder|publisher=Monster Talk Podcast|date=July 27, 2011|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, plating of the era in which the batteries are claimed to have been used have been found to be [[Gilding#Fire-gilding|fire-gilded]] (with [[mercury (element)|mercury]]).&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

'''Bertha Eckstein-Diener''' (March 18, 1874, [[Vienna]] – February 20, 1948, [[Geneva]]), also known by her American pseudonym as '''Helen Diner''', was an Austrian writer, travel journalist, feminist historian and [[intellectual]]. Her book ''Mothers and Amazons'' (1930), was the first to focus on women's cultural history. It is regarded as a classic study of [[Matriarchy]].&lt;ref name="Dinner party"&gt;[[Brooklyn Museum]] Dinner party database&lt;/ref&gt; 

She was a member of the ''"[[Arthurians]],"'' a group of European intellectuals active in the 1930s, each of whom adopted a name from Arthur's Round Table (Diner was [[Galahad|Sir Galahad]]). Each member undertook to research an area of knowledge hitherto little known to Western culture. Diner set out to document a [[feminist history]] of women, and infused her book ''Mothers and Amazons'' (''Mütter und Amazonen'') with lyrical and poetic language.&lt;ref name="Dinner party"/&gt;

== Life ==
'''Bertha Diener''' came from a [[middle-class]] family and received a higher education. Against the will of her parents, she married the polymath [[Friedrich Eckstein]], a Viennese scholar and industrialist, in 1898. Like her husband, she was a member of the Vienna Lodge of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]] (Adyar-TG). The couple received in their home at this time such notables as [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], [[Adolf Loos]], and [[Peter Altenberg]]. In 1904 Bertha left her husband and her son Percy (born 1899) and began her travels which took her to [[Egypt]], [[Greece]], and [[England]]. The couple finally divorced in 1909 and Frederick Eckstein died in 1939 at the age of 78. 

Her 2nd son, Roger (born 1910) was fathered by [[Theodore Beer]], but was placed with a foster family and did not make contact again with his mother until 1936 by letter and in person only in 1938 in Berlin. From 1919 Diener lived in [[Lucerne]], [[Switzerland]]. 
Diener initially wrote under the pseudonym '''Ahasvera''' (roughly translated as "Perpetual traveler").&lt;ref&gt;Collection of essays published Munich,1924, by Albert Langen Verlag für Literatur und Kunst, as ''Der Unfug des Sterbens : ausgewählte Essays, von Prentice Mulford ; bearbeitet und aus dem Englischen übersetzt von Sir Galahad'', authors: Mulford, Prentice, 1834-1891. ; Eckstein-Diener, Bertha Helene, (pseudonyms, "Ahasvera", "Sir Galahad", "Helen Diner"), 1874-1948.[http://www.biblio.com/bookstore/joseph-valles-books/catalog-63-occult-page-1~1e964~bbef8]&lt;/ref&gt;  Her best-known works were published under the name '''Sir Galahad''', from the knights of King Arthur. Besides her books, she wrote a series of articles for newspapers and magazines and translated three works of American journalists and the esoteric writer [[Prentice Mulford]]. 

Between 1914 and 1919 she wrote ''Kegelschnitte Gottes'', about the situation of women during that period. From 1925 to 1931, she worked on ''Mütter und Amazonen'', a women-focused cultural history, based on the work of [[Johann Jakob Bachofen]].

She died aged 73 on 20 February 1948 in [[Geneva]], five weeks after an operation. Her last work, a cultural history of England, remained unfinished.

The '''Bir el Qutt inscriptions'''{{cref2|A}} ({{lang-ka|ბირ ელ ყუტის წარწერები}}) are the [[Georgian language]] ''[[Early Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East|Byzantine mosaic]]'' inscriptions written in the Georgian ''[[Asomtavruli]]'' script which were excavated at a ''[[Theodore of Amasea|St. Theodore]]'' Georgian monastery in 1952&lt;ref&gt;Khurtsilava, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; by an [[Italians|Italian]] archaeologist [[Virgilio Canio Corbo]] near Bir el Qutt, in the [[Judaean Desert]], 6 km south-east of [[Jerusalem]] and 2 km north of [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref&gt;Khurtsilava, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Georgian inscriptions were found on a mosaic floor.&lt;ref&gt;Gideon Avni, The Byzantine-Islamic Transition in Palestine: An Archaeological Approach, p.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=2aTFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149 149], Oxford University Press, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dairat Al-Athar al-Ammah, Annual of the Department of Antiquities, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Avi-Yonah, Ephraim Stern, Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land, V. 3, pp. 879-882&lt;/ref&gt; Two inscriptions are dated AD 430 and the third one AD 532.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khurtsilava, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

The monastery where the inscriptions were excavated was founded or rebuilt by the Georgian philosopher and royal prince [[Peter the Iberian]]. One of the inscriptions mentions him with his father.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Leloir, Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium, p. 71, Secrétariat du Corpus SCO, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glen Warren Bowersock, Peter Brown, Oleg Grabar, Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World, p. 466&lt;/ref&gt; The other inscription mentions [[Bacurius the Iberian]] who is thought to be a possible grandfather of Peter.&lt;ref&gt;Khurtsilava, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

So far, the first two carvings are the [[List of languages by first written accounts|oldest extant Georgian inscriptions]]. The inscriptions are kept at the museum of the [[Studium Biblicum Franciscanum]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sbf.custodia.org/default.asp?id=536 Monachesimo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109031743/http://sbf.custodia.org/default.asp?id=536 |date=November 9, 2014 }} Studium Biblicum Franciscanum&lt;/ref&gt; Inscription 2 mentioning [[Peter the Iberian]] is currently missing.&lt;ref&gt;Khurtsilava, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''children of Bill 101''' (''les enfants de la loi 101'') is the name given to the generation of children whose parents immigrated to [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] after the adoption of the 1977 [[Charter of the French Language]] (Bill 101).

One of the Charter's articles stipulates that all children under 16 must receive their primary and secondary education in French schools, unless one of the child's parents has received most of their education in English, in Canada, or the child themself has already received a substantial part of their education in English, in Canada.

Mostly because of this, many of the children of Bill 101, already adults as of 2001, numbering between 93,800 and 100,600 individuals,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Paillé]], «L'enseignement en français au primaire et au secondaire pour les enfants d'immigrants : un dénombrement démographique», dans : [[Pierre Bouchard (sociologue)|Pierre Bouchard]] et [[Richard Y. Bourhis]], éd., ''L'aménagement linguistique au Québec : 25 ans d'application de la Charte de la langue française'', Québec, Les publications du Québec, 2002, p. 51-67, [http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/ressources/bibliotheque/ouvrages/amenagement_hs/ral01_Charte_Paille_VF_1.pdf  Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; have adopted French as their primary language of communication, and in a much greater proportion than the previous generations of immigrants, who had adopted English.

==Background==

{{One source|date=January 2013}}
*'''Constitution Act 1867, Section 133'''
:1867 marks the beginning of legislation regarding language inequality in Canada.  This predecessor to Bill 101 was largely important for lawmakers and the provinces they represented.  In this constitutional amendment, the Canadian legislature recognized the prevalence of francophones in the government.  In response, Section 133 gave legislators the right to use French or English in Parliament and the courts at the federal level and in Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Conrick, M. (2006). The challenges of linguistic duality for francophone Canada: contact, conflict and continuity. International Journal of Francophone Studies, 9(3), 311-328. doi:10.1386/ijfs.9.3.311_1&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1960s'''
:The 1960s brought an increased awareness in Canada of the problems that francophones in an English speaking country faced.  Both culturally and linguistically, francophone Canadians experienced opposition and difficulty in all public arenas.  In addition, French speakers at the time were economically underprivileged in Canada specifically when compared to English speakers.   This held true even in Quebec, which held a majority of francophones.  In an effort to improve the situation of French speakers, the Royal Commission of Bilingualism and Biculturalism (B &amp; B Commission) was established in 1963 under the Lester B. Pearson Government.  The establishment of this commission represented and promoted the cultural and linguistic composition of Canada for the first time.  This commission confirmed inferior economic position of francophones in Canada.  Owing in large part to the results of research and activism by this group, the Official Languages Act was passed in 1969.  This act was passed under the government of Elliot Trudeau.  With it, a Commissioner of Official Languages was deemed necessary in order to preserve and promote the rights of French speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Conrick, M. (2006). The challenges of linguistic duality for francophone Canada: contact, conflict and continuity. International Journal of Francophone Studies, 9(3), 311-328. doi:10.1386/ijfs.9.3.311_1&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'''
:After a decade of changes in language policy during the 1960s in Canada, francophones received even greater assistance in language rights in 1982.  Part of the Constitution Act of 1982 gave constitutional status to language rights and guaranteed education rights to provincial minorities.   The concept of education rights for minorities had been considered controversial in the past.  With the introduction of this new Bill, however, the rights of provincial linguistic minorities were strengthened.  This legislation applied to francophone communities in all but one case.&lt;ref&gt;Conrick, M. (2006). The challenges of linguistic duality for francophone Canada: contact, conflict and continuity. International Journal of Francophone Studies, 9(3), 311-328. doi:10.1386/ijfs.9.3.311_1&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Recent Legislation'''
:The effects of multiple languages in one country still require legislation in Canada.  The provincial and national governments must constantly work to accommodate changes in language and culture in Montreal and throughout Canada.  In 2003, the Five Year Action Plan for Official Languages was established.  This plan aimed to promote official languages from 2003 to 2008.  The importance of language duality was recognized by officials as not only a part of the Canadian heritage but also as an asset for the future.  Furthermore, this plan specified three specific areas of development.  These three areas accommodated areas of specific concern for the francophone community:  education, community development and public service.&lt;ref&gt;Conrick, M. (2006). The challenges of linguistic duality for francophone Canada: contact, conflict and continuity. International Journal of Francophone Studies, 9(3), 311-328. doi:10.1386/ijfs.9.3.311_1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of Bill 101==
:The overall effects of Bill 101 are difficult to measure because of the nature of language learning.  However, overall there has been a small increase in the percentage of francophones.  Overall a fifty percent increase over 1970 of bilingual allophones has been noted.  However, despite concerns that were present before the bill was enacted, there has been no discernable loss of English after the bill.  Additionally, there has been no increase in job demand for allophones since the bill's inaction.&lt;ref&gt;McAndrew, M., &amp; Lamarre, P. (1996).

The expression has been traced back to 1615, when it first appeared in a book by [[Johannes Kepler]] as the Latin usage ''{{lang|la|vulgaris aerae}}'',&lt;ref name="LiveScience"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coolman|first1=Robert|title=Keeping Time: The Origin of B.C. &amp; A.D.|url=https://www.livescience.com/45510-anno-domini.html|website=Live Science|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae1 /&gt; and to 1635 in English as "[[wikt:Vulgar|Vulgar]]{{efn|from the Latin word ''[[wikt:vulgus|vulgus]]'', the common people - to contrast it with the [[Regnal year]] system of dating used by the State.}} Era." The term "Common Era" can be found in English as early as 1708,&lt;ref name=1708CommonInEnglish /&gt; and became more widely used in the mid-19th century by Jewish academics. In the later 20th century, the use of CE and BCE was popularized in academic and scientific publications, and more generally by authors and publishers wishing to emphasize [[secularism]] or sensitivity to non-Christians, by not explicitly referencing [[Jesus]] as "[[Christ (title)|Christ]]" and ''[[Dominus (title)|Dominus]]'' ("Lord") through use of the abbreviation{{efn|AD is shortened from ''{{lang|la|anno Domini nostri Jesu Christi}}'' ("in the year of Our Lord Jesus Christ").&lt;ref name=Irvin /&gt;}}  "AD".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1620546.html |title=BCE date designation called more sensitive |author=Andrew Herrmann |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |date=27 May 2006 |quote=Herrmann observes, "The changes – showing up at museums, in academic circles and in school textbooks – have been touted as more sensitive to people of faiths outside of Christianity."

== History ==

=== Origins ===
{{See also|Anno Domini}}
The year numbering system used with Common Era notation was devised by the Christian monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in the year 525 to replace the [[Era of Martyrs]] system, because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.&lt;ref name=Pedersen /&gt; He attempted to number years from an initial reference date ("[[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]"), an event he referred to as the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Pedersen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, L.E., (1992), [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/calendars.html "Calendars"] in Seidelmann, P.K., ''The Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'', Sausalito CA: University Science Books, 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BW_1mt4oebQC&amp;pg=PA686&amp;dq=jesus+birth+year+before |title=The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |first=Geoffrey W. |last=Bromiley |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |year=1995 |isbn= 978-0-8028-3781-3 |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dionysius labeled the column of the table in which he introduced the new era as "''Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi''".&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, O., (1983), "The Ecclesiastical Calendar and the Life of the Church" in Coyne, G.V. et al.

Numbering years in this manner became more widespread in Europe with its usage by [[Bede]] in England in 731. Bede also introduced the practice of dating years before what he supposed was the year of birth of Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;Bede wrote of the Incarnation of Jesus, but treated it as synonymous with birth. Blackburn, B &amp; Holford-Strevens, L, (2003), ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'', Oxford University Press, 778.&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice of not using a year zero.{{efn|As noted in [[History of zero|History of the zero]], the use of zero in Western civilization was uncommon before the twelfth century.}} In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last [[Western Europe]]an country to [[Spanish era|switch to the system]] begun by Dionysius.&lt;ref name="CathEncy-Chron" /&gt;

The term "Common Era" is traced back in English to its appearance as "[[wikt:Vulgar|Vulgar]] Era" to distinguish dates on the Ecclesiastic calendar in popular use from dates of the [[regnal year]], the year of reign of a sovereign, typically used in national law.

The first use of the Latin term ''vulgaris aerae''{{Efn|name=VulgarisAerae0|In Latin, ''Common Era'' is written as ''Vulgaris Aerae''. It also occasionally appears as ''æræ vulgaris'', ''aerae vulgaris'', ''aeram vulgarem'', ''anni vulgaris'', ''vulgaris aerae Christianae'', and ''anni vulgatae nostrae aerae Christianas''.}} discovered so far was in a 1615 book by [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae1 /&gt; Kepler uses it again in a 1616 table of [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]],&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae2&gt;{{cite book |title=Second use of "vulgaris aerae" (Latin for Common Era) (1616) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kElSQAACAAJ&amp;dq=vulgaris+aerae|publisher=Plancus |author=Kepler, Johann |year=1616 |accessdate=2011-05-18}} {{cite book |title=Ephemerides novae motuum caelestium, ab Ānno vulgaris aerae MDCXVII en observationibus potissimum Tychonis Brahei hypothesibus physicis, et tabulis Rudolphinis... |first=Johann |last=Kepler |publisher=Plancus |year=1616 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1617.&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae3&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5w47twAACAAJ&amp;dq=vulgaris+aerae|title=Third use of "vulgaris aerae" (Latin for Common Era) (1617) |publisher=sumptibus authoris, excudebat Iohannes Plancus |author1=Kepler, Johannes |author2=Fabricus, David |year=1617 |accessdate=2011-05-18}} {{cite book |title=Ephemerides novae motuum coelestium, ab anno vulgaris aerae MDCXVII[-XXXVI]... |quote=Part 3 has title: Tomi L Ephemeridvm Ioannis Kepleri pars tertia, complexa annos à M.DC.XXIX. in M.DC.XXXVI.

In general publications, in the 200 years between 1808 and 2008 the ratio of usage of BCE to BC has increased by about 20% and CE to AD by about 50%, primarily since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=BCE,BC,CE,AD&amp;year_start=1808&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=10&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1;,BCE;,c0;.t1;,BC;,c0;.t1;,CE;,c0;.t1;,AD;,c0|title=Google Ngram Viewer|website=books.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary usage ==
Some academics in the fields of [[theology]], [[education]] and [[history]] have adopted CE and BCE notation, although there is some disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Society for Historical Archaeology states in its more recent style guide "Do not use C.E. (common era), B.P. (before present), or B.C.E.; convert these expressions to A.D. and B.C." (In section I 5 the Society explains how to use "years B.P." in connection with [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon ages]].) {{cite web |url=https://sha.org/documents/SHAStyleGuide-Dec2011.pdf |title=Style Guide |author=Society for Historical Archaeology |date=December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419052334/http://www.sha.org/documents/SHAStyleGuide-Dec2011.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-19 |accessdate=2017-01-16 |deadurl=no |df=}} whereas the [[American Anthropological Association]] style guide takes a different approach calling for "C.E." and "B.C.E." {{cite web |url=http://www.aaanet.org/publications/guidelines.cfm |title=AAA Style Guide |format=PDF |author=American Anthropological Society
|date=2009 |accessdate=2015-05-26 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More visible uses of Common Era notation have recently surfaced at major museums in the English-speaking world. Furthermore, several style guides now prefer or mandate its usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.egyptstudy.org/ostracon/guidelines.html |journal=The Ostracon – Journal of the Egyptian Studies Society |title=Submission Guidelines for ''The Ostracon'' |quote=For dates, please use the now-standard "BCE–CE" notation, rather than "BC–AD."

Even some style guides for Christian churches prefer its use: for example, the Episcopal Diocese ''Maryland Church News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ang-md.org/mcn/style_guide.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620230309/http://ang-md.org/mcn/style_guide.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 June 2006 |title=Maryland Church News Submission Guide &amp; Style Manual |work=Maryland Church News |format=PDF |date=1 April 2005 |accessdate=2011-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the usage of the BCE/CE notation in [[textbook]]s is growing.&lt;ref name=Gormley /&gt; Some publications have moved over to using it exclusively. For example, the 2007 World Almanac was the first edition to switch over to the BCE/CE usage, ending a 138-year usage of the traditional BC/AD dating notation. It is used by the [[College Board]] in its history tests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/history_world/topic.html?worldhist |title=AP: World History |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Norton Anthology of English Literature]]. Others have taken a different approach. The US-based [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] uses BCE/CE notation in articles on non-Christian religious topics such as [[Religious significance of Jerusalem#Jerusalem, Jews and Judaism|Jerusalem and Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |title=Jerusalem Timeline |publisher=History Channel |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520111303/http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |archivedate=May 20, 2011 }};{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |title=Jerusalem: Biographies |publisher=History Channel |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520111303/http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |archivedate=2011-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[England and Wales]] introduced the BCE/CE notation system into the official school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-531644-ad-and-bc-become-cebce.do |title=AD and BC become CE/BCE |date=9 February 2002 |accessdate=2012-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220120909/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-531644-ad-and-bc-become-cebce.do |archivedate=December 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, in the United States, the Kentucky State School Board reversed its decision to use BCE and CE in the state's new Program of Studies, leaving education of students about these concepts a matter of discretion at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tffky.org/articles/Press%20Releases/prs%2006-14-06%20MC.html |title=State School Board reverses itself on B.C./A.D. controversy |publisher=Family Foundation of Kentucky |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427032052/http://www.tffky.org/articles/Press%20Releases/prs%2006-14-06%20MC.html |archivedate=April 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.kctcs.edu/todaysnews/index.cfm?tn_date=2006-06-16#5119 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710123618/http://legacy.kctcs.edu/todaysnews/index.cfm?tn_date=2006-06-16#5119 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 July 2009 |title=School board keeps traditional historic designations |author=Joe Biesk |publisher=Louisville Courier-Journal |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=2011-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpe.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/5F08162C-899F-47FE-9367-1DDD82DE74E6/0/6_CommissionerofEdReport.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926165947/http://cpe.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/5F08162C-899F-47FE-9367-1DDD82DE74E6/0/6_CommissionerofEdReport.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 September 2006|title=Kentucky Board of Education Report |publisher=Kentucky Board of Education Report |date=10 June 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011, media reports suggested that the BC/AD notation in Australian school textbooks would be replaced by BCE/CE notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2033225/Australia-goes-PC-ban-BC-Birth-Jesus-removed-reference-point-dates-school-history-books.html |title=Australia goes all PC with a ban on BC: Birth of Jesus to be removed as reference point for dates in school history books |date=2 September 2011|accessdate=2012-02-05 |location=London |work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story became national news and drew opposition from some politicians and church leaders. Weeks after the story broke, the [[Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority]] denied the rumour and stated that the BC/AD notation would remain, with CE and BCE as an optional suggested learning activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/adbc-rock-solid-in-curriculum-20111020-1mab2.html |title=AD/BC rock solid in curriculum |date=21 October 2011|accessdate=2012-03-04 |location=Melbourne |work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==

=== Support ===
The use of CE in Jewish scholarship was historically motivated by the desire to avoid the implicit "Our Lord" in the abbreviation ''AD''.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Although other aspects of dating systems are based in Christian origins, AD is a direct reference to Jesus as Lord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American and English Encyclopedia of Law and Practice|year=1910|page=1116|quote=It has been said of the Latin words anno Domini, meaning in the year of our Lord [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Religions At Your Fingertips|author1=Michael McDowell |author2=Nathan Robert Brown |publisher=Penguin|year=2009|isbn=978-1-101-01469-1|page=38|quote=Marked by the turn of the Common Era, C.E., originally referred to as A.D., an abbreviation of the Latin ''Anno Domini'', meaning "Year of our God/Lord." This was a shortening of ''Anno Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'', meaning "Year of our God/Lord Jesus Christ."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the Common Era notation assert that the use of BCE/CE shows sensitivity to those who use the same year numbering system as the one that originated with and is currently used by [[Christianity|Christians]], but who are not themselves Christian.&lt;ref name="RelTolrnc" /&gt;

Former United Nations Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], himself a [[Protestant]],&lt;ref name="kofifaith"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lefevere |first=Patricia |title=Annan: 'Peace is never a perfect achievement'&amp;nbsp;– United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan |publisher=National Catholic Reporter |date=11 December 1998 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_7_35/ai_53460476 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713031248/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_7_35/ai_53460476 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-13 |accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he Christian calendar no longer belongs exclusively to Christians. People of all faiths have taken to using it simply as a matter of convenience. There is so much interaction between people of different faiths and cultures – different civilizations, if you like – that some shared way of reckoning time is a necessity. And so the Christian Era has become the Common Era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/ossg/sg/stories/articleFull.asp?TID=37 |title=Common values for a common era: Even as we cherish our diversity, we need to discover our shared values |author=Annan, Kofi A., (then Secretary-General of the United Nations) |date=28 June 1999 |publisher=Civilization: The Magazine of the Library of Congress |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501020027/http://www.un.org/News/ossg/sg/stories/articleFull.asp?TID=37 |archivedate=May 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adena K. Berkowitz, when arguing at the Supreme Court opted to use BCE and CE because "Given the multicultural society that we live in, the traditional Jewish designations – B.C.E. and C.E. – cast a wider net of inclusion" &lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20180814202630/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/17/magazine/bc-ad-or-bce-ce.html |author=Safire, William |date=17 August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition ===
Some oppose the Common Era notation for explicitly religious reasons. Because the BC/AD notation is based on the traditional year of the conception or birth of Jesus, some Christians are offended by the removal of the reference to him in era notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20061202/ai_n16891064|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012132926/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20061202/ai_n16891064|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 October 2007|last=Whitney|first=Susan|title=Altering history?

Two thousand six years since what? Most people know, regardless of their belief system, and aren't offended by a historical fact.|accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Southern Baptist Convention]] supports retaining the BC/AD abbreviations.&lt;ref name=SBC /&gt;

There are also secular concerns. English language expert [[Kenneth G. Wilson (author)|Kenneth G. Wilson]] speculated in his style guide that "if we do end by casting aside the AD/BC convention, almost certainly some will argue that we ought to cast aside as well the conventional numbering system [that is, the method of numbering years] itself, given its Christian basis."&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; The short lived [[French Republican Calendar]], for example, began with the first year of the [[French First Republic]] and rejected the seven-day week (with its connections to the [[Book of Genesis]]) for a ten-day week.
Priest and writer on interfaith issues [[Raimon Panikkar]] contends that using the designation BCE/CE is a "return... to the most bigoted Christian colonialism" towards non-Christians, who do not necessarily consider the time period following the beginning of the calendar to be a "common era".&lt;ref name=Panikkar&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9-vYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Panikkar,+Raimon+(2004).+Christophany:+The+Fullness+of+Man.

In certain North American academic circles one can see a return-with repercussions elsewhere-to the most bigoted Christian colonialism, along with the good intention of overcoming it. It has been suggested that the terminology of the Western calendar, Christian in origin, be replaced by one that presumably would be neutral and universal. It is understandable that some would protest the use of A.D. (anno Domini), but by eliminating B.C. (before Christ) and substituting B.C.E. (Before the Common Era) scholars betray the depths of the cultural impact of the historico-Christian event. After all, Jesus was not born in the year 1. We select a single event but without any value judgment. To call our age "the Common Era," even though for the Jews, the Chinese, the Tamil, the Muslims, and many others it is not a common era, constitutes the acme of colonialism.|accessdate=2011-05-18|isbn=978-1-57075-564-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' report, it was a student's use of BCE/CE notation, inspired by its use within [[Wikipedia]], which prompted the teacher and politician [[Andrew Schlafly]] to found [[Conservapedia]], a [[Cultural conservatism|cultural conservative]] [[wiki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simon |first=Stephanie |title=A conservative's answer to Wikipedia|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/19/nation/na-schlafly19 |date=22 June 2007 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its "Conservapedia Commandments" is that users must always apply BC/AD notation, since its sponsors perceive BCE/CE notation to "deny the historical basis" of the dating system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:Commandments Conservapedia Commandments] at Conservapedia&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conventions in style guides ==
The abbreviation BCE, just as with BC, always follows the year number. Unlike AD, which traditionally precedes the year number, CE always follows the year number (if context requires that it be written at all).&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; Thus, the current year is written as {{currentyear}} in both notations (or, if further clarity is needed, as {{currentyear}} CE, or as AD {{currentyear}}), and the year that [[Socrates]] died is represented as 399 BCE (the same year that is represented by 399 BC in the BC/AD notation). The abbreviations are sometimes written with small capital letters, or with [[Full stop|periods]] (e.g., "&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;B.C.E.&lt;/span&gt;" or "C.E.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/about15_rules.html |title=Major Rule Changes in The Chicago Manual of Style, Fifteenth Edition |year=2003 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |quote=Certain abbreviations traditionally set in small caps are now in full caps (AD, BCE, and the like), with small caps an option. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070909071543/http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/about15_rules.html|archivedate=9 September 2007|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Style guides for academic texts on religion generally prefer BCE/CE to BC/AD.&lt;ref&gt;''SBL Handbook of Style'' [[Society of Biblical Literature]] 1999 "8.1.2 ERAS – The preferred style is B.C.E. and C.E. (with periods). If you use A.D. and B.C., remember that A.D. precedes the date and B.C. follows it. (For the use of these abbreviations in titles, see §&amp;nbsp;7.1.3.2.)"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar conventions in other languages ==
* In [[Germany]], Jews in [[Berlin]] seem to have already been using "(Before the) Common Era" in the 18th century, while others like [[Moses Mendelssohn]] opposed this usage as it would hinder the integration of Jews into German society.&lt;ref name="Jewish Joke" /&gt; The formulation seems to have persisted among German Jews in the 19th century in forms like ''vor der gewöhnlichen Zeitrechnung'' (before the common chronology).&lt;ref&gt;''Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums.

* In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], Common forms used for "BC" are aC and a. de C. (for antes de Cristo, "before Christ"), with variations in punctuation and sometimes the use of J.C.(Jesucristo) instead of C.

* In [[Welsh language|Welsh]], OC can be expanded to equivalents of both AD (''Oed Crist'') and CE (''Oes Cyffredin''); for dates before the Common Era, CC (traditionally, ''Cyn Crist'') is used exclusively, as ''Cyn yr Oes Cyffredin'' would abbreviate to a mild obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=welsh-termau-cymraeg;982a203b.0610 |title=Welsh-Termau-Cymraeg Archives |publisher=JISCMail |date=19 October 2006 |accessdate=2012-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Armitage''' (born 1965) is a British historian who has written on international and intellectual history. He is chair of the [[Harvard University Department of History|history department]] and [[Lloyd C. Blankfein]] Professor of History at [[Harvard University]].

== Life and career ==

Armitage was born in [[Stockport]], England and educated at [[Stockport Grammar School]] before attending the [[University of Cambridge]] where he read English as an undergraduate. After receiving his BA, he embarked on a PhD in English, initially intending to write his doctoral dissertation on Shakespeare's classical sources and the English [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] poets. During the course of his research, he became interested in the relationship between [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republicanism]] and [[British Empire|empire]] in the works of [[John Milton]] and was increasingly attracted to the discipline of [[intellectual history]]. Funded by a [[Harkness Fellowship]], he took two years off from his PhD to retrain as a historian at Princeton's [[Institute for Advanced Study]].&lt;ref name ="Itinerario"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ittersum | first1 = Martine V. | last2 = Jacobs | first2 = Jaap | year = 2012 | title = Are we all global historians now? | url = http://scholar.harvard.edu/armitage/files/s0165115312000551a.pdf | format = PDF | journal = [[Itinerario]] | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 7–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded his doctorate in history from Cambridge in 1992 with his dissertation ''The British empire and the civic tradition, 1656–1742'', a study of the relationship between English literature and Britain's imperial ventures in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Institute of Historical Research]].

After completing his PhD, Armitage remained at Cambridge until 1993 as a junior research fellow at [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge|Emmanuel College]]. He then joined the history faculty at [[Columbia University]] during which time he spent 2000 and 2001 at Harvard University on a fellowship. He joined the faculty of Harvard in 2004, later becoming the Lloyd C. Blankfein Professor of History and Chair of the Department of History. In 2008 Harvard named him a Walter Channing Cabot Fellow for "achievements and scholarly eminence in the fields of literature, history or art".&lt;ref name = "AAH"&gt;[[Australian Academy of the Humanities]].

From 1892 he studied history and [[philology]] at the [[University of Vienna]], receiving his doctorate in 1895 with the dissertation on [[Tacitus]], ''Zur Kritik von Tacitus’ Quellen in den Historien''. By way of a study grant he visited Rome in 1898/99, then in 1901 began work at the Vienna National Library, an institution that he would be associated with for most of his career. In 1918 he obtained his [[habilitation]] at the university, where in 1925 he was named an associate professor of Roman history. In 1933 he became a member of the [[German Archaeological Institute]].&lt;ref name=OA&gt;[http://www.oeaw.ac.at/online-gedenkbuch/gedenkbuch/personen/a-h/edmund-groag/ Edmund Groag] Österreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UW&gt;[http://gedenkbuch.univie.ac.at/index.php?id=435&amp;no_cache=1&amp;L=2&amp;person_single_id=33086 Edmund Groag] Gedenkbuch der Universität Wien&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born into a Jewish family and converted to Catholicism in 1901. Despite this, he was removed from his position at the university for racial reasons following the [[Anschluss]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8169">'''Eudemus of Rhodes''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Εὔδημος}}) was an [[ancient Greek]] philosopher, considered the first historian of science, who lived from c. 370 BC until c. 300 BC. He was one of Aristotle's most important pupils, editing his teacher's work and making it more easily accessible. Eudemus' nephew, Pasicles, was also credited with editing Aristotle's works.

==Life==
Eudemus was born on the isle of [[Rhodes]], but spent a large part of his life in [[Athens]], where he studied philosophy at [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic School]]. Eudemus's collaboration with Aristotle was long-lasting and close, and he was generally considered to be one of Aristotle's most brilliant pupils: he and [[Theophrastus|Theophrastus of Lesbos]] were regularly called not Aristotle's "disciples", but his "companions" (ἑταῖροι).

It seems that Theophrastus was the greater genius of the two, continuing Aristotle's studies in a wide range of areas. Although Eudemus too conducted original research, his ''forte'' lay in systematizing Aristotle's philosophical legacy, and in a clever didactical presentation of his teacher's ideas. Later authors who wrote commentaries on Aristotle often made good use of Eudemus's preliminary work. It is for this reason that, though Eudemus's writings themselves are not extant, we know many citations and testimonia regarding his work, and are thus able to build up a picture of him and his work.

Aristotle, shortly before his death in 322 BC, designated Theophrastus to be his successor as head of the Peripatetic School. Eudemus then returned to Rhodes, where he founded his own philosophical school, continued his own philosophical research, and went on editing Aristotle's work.

==Historian of science==
At the insistence of Aristotle, Eudemus wrote histories of Greek mathematics and astronomy. Though only fragments of these have survived, included in the works of later authors, their value is immense. It is only because later authors used Eudemus's writings that we still are informed about the early history and development of Greek science. In his historical writings Eudemus showed how the purely practically oriented knowledge and skills that earlier peoples such as the Egyptians and the Babylonians had known, were by the Greeks given a theoretical basis, and built into a coherent and comprehensive philosophical building.

*As regards his  ''History of Arithmetics'' (Άριθμητικὴ ἱστορία) we only have the tiniest bit of information: there is only one testimonium, saying that Eudemus mentions the discovery by the [[Pythagoras|Pythagoreans]] that it is possible to connect musical intervals with integer numbers.
*Eudemus's ''History of Geometry'' (Γεωμετρικὴ ἱστορία) is mentioned by many more writers, including [[Proclus]], [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]], and [[Pappus of Alexandria]]. From them we know that the book treated the work by, among others, [[Thales of Miletus]], the Pythagoreans, [[Oenopides of Chios]], and [[Hippocrates of Chios]]. Among the topics Eudemus discussed were the discovery of geometrical theorems and constructions (systematized in Eudemus's days by [[Euclid]] in his ''Elements''), and the classical problems of Greek geometry, such as the [[quadrature of the circle]] and the [[duplication of the cube]].
*We know much about Eudemus's ''History of Astronomy'' (Άστρολογικὴ ἱστορία), from sources such as [[Theon of Smyrna]], Simplicius, [[Diogenes Laërtius]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], and others. Building upon those data we can reconstruct with some accuracy the astronomical discoveries that were made in Greece between 600 and 350 BC, as well as the theories that were developed in that period regarding the earth, solar and lunar [[eclipse]]s, the movements of the heavenly bodies, etcetera. Philosophers and astronomers treated by Eudemus include Thales, [[Anaximander]], [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], Oenopides, [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]], and others.

Two other historical works are attributed to Eudemus, but here his authorship is not certain. First, he is said to have written a ''History of Theology'', that discussed the Babylonian, Egyptian, and Greek ideas regarding the origins of the universe. Secondly, he is said to have been the author of a ''History of Lindos'' (Lindos is a town on the Greek island of Rhodes)

To Eudemus is also ascribed a book with miraculous stories about animals and their human-like properties (exemplary braveness, ethical sensitivity, and the like). However, as the character of this work does not at all fit in with the serious scientific approach that is apparent from Eudemus's other works, it is generally held that Eudemus of Rhodes cannot have been the author of this book (it may have been another Eudemus — his was a fairly common name in ancient Greece).

==Editor of Aristotle's work==
Eudemus, Theophrastus, and other pupils of Aristotle took care that the intellectual heritage of their master after his death would remain accessible in a reliable form, by recording it in a long series of publications. These were based on Aristotle's writings, their own lecture notes, personal recollections, etcetera.

Thus one of Aristotle's writings is still called the ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]'', probably because it was Eudemus who edited (though very lightly) this text. More important, Eudemus wrote a number of influential books that clarified Aristotle's works:

*Eudemus's ''Physics'' (Φυσικά) was a compact, and more didactical version of Aristotle's homonymous work.
* Eudemus wrote two or three books dealing with logics (''Analytics'' and ''Categories'' (possibly the same book), and ''On discourse'' (Περι λεξεως)), which probably expounded Aristotle's ideas. 
* Finally, a geometrical work, ''On the angle'' (Περὶ γωνίας).

A comparison between the Eudemus fragments and their corresponding parts in the works of Aristotle shows that Eudemus was a gifted teacher: he systematizes subject matter, leaves out digressions that distract from the main theme, adds specific examples to illustrate abstract statements, formulates in catching phrases, and occasionally inserts a joke to keep the reader attentive.

'''Francis John Haverfield''', [[Fellow of the British Academy|FBA]] (8 November 1860 at Shipston-on-Stour – 1 October 1919) was a [[UK|British]] historian and archaeologist. From 1907 to 1919 he held the [[Camden Professorship of Ancient History]] at the [[University of Oxford]].

==Education==
Educated at [[Winchester College]]&lt;ref&gt;Sabben-Clare, James. ''Winchester College''. Paul Cave Publications, 1981. p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Oxford]], he also worked under [[Theodor Mommsen]]. In 1907 he became [[Camden Professor of Ancient History]] at Oxford.

==Work==
Haverfield was the first to undertake a scientific study of Roman Britain and is considered by some to be the first theorist to tackle the issue of the [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]] of the Roman Empire. Some consider him the innovator of the discipline of [[Romano-British]] archaeology.&lt;ref name="Freeman2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip Freeman |title=The Best Training-ground for Archaeologists: Francis Haverfield and the Invention of Romano-British Archaeology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-AZoAAAAMAAJ |year=2007 |publisher=Oxbow |isbn=978-1-84217-280-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His works include ''The Romanization of Roman Britain'' (1905)&lt;ref name="Haverfield2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=F.

He excavated the [[Castra|Roman fort]] at [[Hardknott Roman Fort|Hardknott]], the site of ancient ''Mediobogdum'' in Cumbria.&lt;ref name="Haverfield1893"&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis Haverfield|title=The Roman Fort on Hardknott, Known as Hardknott Castle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MY8TAAAAQAAJ|year=1893|publisher=T.

He gave the [[Rhind Lectures]] in 1905 and 1907, on Roman Britain.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Haverfield is credited as playing a prominent role in creation of both the [[Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies]] and the [[British School at Rome]].&lt;ref name="VanBuren"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Buren | first1 = A.

==Students==
Among his students was the archaeologist and topographer [[Thomas Ashby]] (1874–1931), the first scholar and third director of the [[British School at Rome]], the Oxford historian, archaeologist, and philosopher [[R. G. Collingwood]] (1889–1943) and the archaeologist and anthropologist [[John Garstang]] (1876-1956).

'''Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus'''{{refn|group=n|Per Roman naming conventions, this name was abbreviated {{nowrap|'''Cn. Pompeius Trogus'''}}, leading to the occasional mistaken appearance of "Cnaeus Pompeius Trogus".}} {{nowrap|({{floruit|1st}} century {{sc|bc}}),}} also [[anglicization|anglicized]] as {{nowrap|'''Pompey Trogue''',{{refn|group=n|Less often, the mistaken "Trogue Pompey"}}}} was a [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo]]-[[ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Roman historiography|historian]] from the [[Celt]]ic [[Vocontii]] [[list of Celtic tribes|tribe]] in [[Gallia Narbonensis|Narbonese Gaul]] who lived during the reign of the [[list of Roman emperors|emperor]] [[Augustus]]. He was nearly contemporary with [[Livy]].

{{anchor|History|Biography}}

==Life==
Pompeius Trogus's grandfather served under [[Pompey]] in his war against [[Quintus Sertorius|Sertorius]]. Owing to Pompey's influence, he was able to obtain [[Roman citizenship]] and his family adopted their patron's [[Roman naming conventions|praenomen and nomen]] Gnaeus Pompeius. Trogus's father served under [[Julius Caesar]] as his secretary and interpreter.  Trogus himself seems to have been a [[polymath]].

==Works==
Following [[Aristotle]] and [[Theophrastus]], Pompeius Trogus wrote books on the [[natural history]] of animals and plants.

His principal work, however, was his 44-volume ''Philippic Histories and the Origin of the Whole World and the Places of the Earth'' (''{{lang|la|Historiae Philippicae et Totius Mundi Origines et Terrae Situs}}'') which had as its principal theme the [[Macedonian Empire]] founded by {{nowrap|[[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]}} but functioned as a general history of all of the parts of the world which fell under the control of [[Alexander the Great]] and [[diadochi|his successors]], with extensive ethnographical and geographical digressions. Trogus began with [[Ninus]], [[Greek myth|legendary]] founder of [[Nineveh]], and ended at about the same point as Livy ({{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;9). The development of the East from the [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]] to the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] is given extensive coverage while early Roman history and the history of the [[Iberian peninsula]] is briefly glossed in the last two books. The ''Philippic Histories'' is indebted to earlier [[Greek historiography|Greek historians]] such as [[Theopompus]] (whose own ''Philippica'' may have suggested Trogus's title), [[Ephorus]], [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]], and [[Polybius]]. On the grounds that such a work was beyond the powers of Gallo-Roman, it has generally been assumed that Pompeius Trogus did not gather his material directly from these Greek sources but from an existing compilation or translation by a Greek such as the ''Universal History'' compiled by [[Timagenes]] of Alexandria.

==Style==
Pompeius Trogus's [[historiography|idea of history]] was more exacting than that of [[Sallust]] and [[Livy]], whom he criticized for their habit of putting elaborate speeches into the mouths of the characters of whom they wrote.

==Legacy==
The original text of the ''Philippic Histories'' has been lost and is preserved only in excerpts by other authors (including [[Augustan History|Vopiscus]], [[Jerome]], and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]) and in a loose [[epitome]] by the later historian [[Justin (historian)|Justin]].{{sfnp|Winterbottom|2006}} Justin aimed only to preserve the parts he felt most important or interesting about Pompeius Trogus's work, with the last recorded event being the recovery of Roman standards from the Parthians in 20&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}. In the manuscripts of Justin's works, however, a separate series of summaries (''{{lang|la|prologi}}'') of the original work have been preserved. Even in their present mutilated state the works are often an important authority for the ancient history of the East.

Pompeius Trogus's works on animals and plants were extensively quoted in the works of [[Pliny the Elder]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7874">'''Hawaiian studies''' is an academic discipline dedicated to the study of [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiians]]. It evolved in the second half of the 20th century partly in response to charges that traditional disciplines such as [[anthropology]], history, [[English language]], [[ethnology]], [[Asian Studies]], and [[orientalism]] were imbued with an inherently [[eurocentric]] perspective. [[Ethnic Studies]] has mostly been a study of minority settler cultures although Hawaiian Studies shares with [[Ethnic Studies]] attempts to remedy problems with other academic disciplines by trying to study Hawaiian culture and people on their own terms, in their own language, acknowledging their own values.

==History==
In [[Hawaii]], the discipline of Hawaiian Studies evolved out of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and early 1970s, which saw growing self-awareness and radicalization of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and [[Decolonization]] struggles around the world.{{citation needed |date= April 2014}} Hawaiian Studies courses and then departments were established on campus around Hawaii. Thinkers like [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]] and [[Linda Tuhiwai Smith]] influence Hawaiian Studies.{{citation needed |date= December 2010}}

While early Hawaiian Studies scholarship focused on the previously repressed histories and identities of Hawaiian groups within the context of the U.S., over time the field of study has expanded to encompass ontological/epistemological philosophy, transnationalism, comparative race studies and postmodernist/poststructuralist critiques. {{citation needed |date= April 2014}} While pioneering thinkers relied on frameworks, theories and methodologies such as those found in the allied fields of sociology, history, literature and film, scholars in the field today utilize multidisciplinary as well as comparative perspectives, increasingly within an international or transnational context. {{citation needed |date= April 2014}}

[[Haunani-Kay Trask|Professor Haunani Kay Trask]] became the first tenured professor in Hawaiian Studies at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] in 1986. She assisted [[Lilikala Kame'eleihiwa]], Jonathan Osorio and [[Terry Kainalu Young|Kainalu Young]] in obtaining their doctorates on Hawaiian Studies topics and in becoming tenured professors in Hawaiian Studies. After years of effort, [[Gladys Brandt|Gladys Kamakakuokalani Brandt]] and Trask were able to get funding to build a permanent home for the Center for Hawaiian Studies. It is now called the Kamakakuokalani Center for Hawaiian Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Kamakakuokalani Center for Hawaiian Studies |publisher= [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] |url= http://www.catalog.hawaii.edu/schoolscolleges/hawaiian/kamakakuokalani.htm |accessdate= December 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Center added two master's degree programs in Hawaiian Studies in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Two master's degrees in Hawaiian Studies approved |date= May 10, 2005 |author= Kimberly Gee |work= Ka Leo (The Voice) |url= http://www.kaleo.org/2.13219/two-master-s-degrees-in-hawaiian-studies-approved-1.1810427 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The center is now part of the Hawai{{okina}}inuiakea School of Hawaiian Knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Hawaiʻinuiakea School of Hawaiian Knowledge |publisher= [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] |url= http://www.catalog.hawaii.edu/schoolscolleges/hawaiian/ |accessdate= December 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hawaiian Studies program at the [[University of Hawaii at Hilo]] is centered more closely around the instruction of the [[Hawaiian language]]. In 1997, the Ka Haka ‘Ula O Ke‘elikōlani College of Hawaiian Language was established to complement its Hale Kuamo{{okina}}o. [http://www.uhh.hawaii.edu/academics/hawn/]

The Hawaiian Studies program at the [[BYUH|Brigham Young University Hawaii]] structures its instruction and research around perceived connections between Hawaiian culture and the [[Book of Mormon]] and other doctrinal beliefs of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. [http://w2.byuh.edu/academics/hwnstudies/]

==Criticism==
Hawaiian Studies has faced some opposition and rejection from critics. They have no objection about Hawaiian culture being legitimate topics of academic research.  What they object to is the current state of Ethnic Studies which they see as characterised by excessive left wing political ideology or Hawaiian claims to justice which, in their view, greatly undermined the scholarly validity of the research. Hawaiian Studies has been accused of promoting "racial separatism", "racial supremacy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conklin|first1=Kenneth|title=University of Hawai'i and Hawaiian Sovereignty -- A Case Study in Political Correctness Run Amok|url=http://www.angelfire.com/hi2/hawaiiansovereignty/uhacafreeintro.html|website=Hawaiian Sovereignty|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;", linguistic isolation" and "racial preference". 

Professor Haunani-Kay Trask was criticized for contributing to a culture of systemic racism and violence against white people in Hawaii in an intelligence report published by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC). The Law Center wrote that Professor Trask's book ''From A Native Daughter'' justifies hatred against white people by Native Hawaiians. The SPLC also finds violence against white people as being justified in Trask's poem, ''Racist White Woman'', which reads in part: "I could kick/Your face, puncture/Both eyes./You deserve this kind/Of violence./No more vicious/Tongues, obscene/Lies./Just a knife/Slitting your tight/Little heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keller|first1=Larry|title=Hawaii Suffering From Racial Prejudice; Hawaii Has a Racism Problem|url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2009/fall/prejudice-in-paradise|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a guest lecture at Stanford University, Trask embraced the label of 'racist', saying, "In Hawaii, I am probably the most famous racist." She added that it impossible for a Hawaiian to not be considered racist in Hawaii unless "you dance in a hotel". She also stated that, if she could have her way, non-Hawaiians would have no property rights in a sovereign Hawaii. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Toole|first1=Kathleen|title=Hawaiian nationalist discusses rights Constitution doesn't recognize|url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/98/980401hawaii.html|website=Stanford News service|accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of Hawaiian Studies feel that opposition comes from a reactionary movement from the right. They point out the rise of the conservative movement in the United States during the 1990s which saw the discipline come increasingly under attack. For proponents, the backlash is characterised as an attempt to preserve "traditional values" of Western culture, symbolized by the United States. For some critics, this actually is a slant by the proponents to disparage criticism by false association to right wing ideology. 

Hawaiian Studies has suffered most criticism by attorney William Burgess and retired high school mathematics teacher [[Kenneth Conklin]]. Their criticism is political and aimed at Hawaiian claims to justice and has never really attacked the actual scholarship of Hawaiian Studies scholars. [http://www.kenconklin.com/]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2074">'''Hermann von Liebenau''' (3 October 1807 &amp;ndash; 28 July 1874) was a [[Swiss historian]].

He studied medicine in Germany and Austria until 1836, but after this published in historiography exclusively.
He moved to Lucerne in 1837, where he remained until his death with the exception of an absence during 1855 to 1860 during which he was in [[Papal States|Roman]] service as a physician.

He published some works on contemporary history, the [[Restoration and Regeneration (Switzerland)|Swiss Regeneration]] and the formation of [[Switzerland as a federal state]] but mostly focussed on the medieval history of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]].

==Origins==
Social institutions similar to serfdom occurred in the ancient world. The status of the [[helots]] in the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[city-state]] of [[Sparta]] resembled that of medieval serfs.  By the 3rd century AD, the [[Roman Empire]] faced a labour shortage.  Large Roman landowners increasingly relied on Roman freemen, acting as tenant farmers, (instead of on slaves) to provide labour.&lt;ref name="Mackay298"&gt;{{cite book |last= Mackay |first= Christopher |title= Ancient Rome: A Military and Political History |location= New York |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2004 |page= 298 |isbn= 0521809185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The status of these tenant farmers, eventually known as [[colonus (person)|coloni]], steadily eroded.   Because the tax system implemented by [[Diocletian]] (reigned 284-305)  assessed taxes based both on land and on the inhabitants of that land, it became administratively inconvenient for peasants to leave the land where the census counted them.&lt;ref name="Mackay298" /&gt; In 332 AD [[Emperor Constantine]] issued legislation that greatly restricted the rights of the coloni and tied them to the land.  Some{{quantify|date=December 2016}} see these laws as the beginning of medieval serfdom in Europe.

However, medieval serfdom really began with the breakup of the [[Carolingian Empire]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} around the 10th century. The demise of this empire, which had ruled much of western Europe for more than 200 years, ushered in a long period during which no strong central government existed in most of Europe. During this period, powerful [[feudalism|feudal lords]] encouraged the establishment of serfdom as a source of agricultural [[labour (economics)|labor]]. Serfdom, indeed, was an institution that reflected a fairly common practice whereby great landlords ensured that others worked to feed them and were held down, legally and economically, while doing so.

== Heyday ==
Serfdom as a system provided most of the agricultural labour throughout the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Slavery]] persisted right through the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24160 Ways of ending slavery]&lt;/ref&gt; but it was rare, diminishing and largely confined to the use of household slaves.  Parts of Europe, including much of [[Scandinavia]], never adopted serfdom.{{why|date=December 2016}}

In the later Middle Ages serfdom began to disappear west of the [[Rhine]] even as it spread through much of the rest of Europe. This was one important cause for the deep differences{{which?|date=December 2016}} between the societies and economies of eastern and western Europe{{where|date=April 2015}}. In [[Western Europe]], the rise of powerful monarchs, towns, and an improving economy weakened the [[manorial system]] through the 13th and 14th centuries; serfdom had become rare by 1400. 

Serfdom in Western Europe came largely to an end in the 15th and 16th centuries, because of changes in the economy, population, and laws governing lord-tenant relations in Western European nations. The enclosure of manor fields for livestock grazing and for larger arable plots made the economy of serfs' small strips of land in open fields less attractive to landowners. Furthermore, the increasing use of money made tenant farming by serfs less profitable; for much less than it cost to support a serf, a lord could now hire workers who were more skilled and pay them in cash. Paid labour was also more flexible, since workers could be hired only when they were needed.

At the same time, increasing unrest and uprisings by serfs and peasants, like [[Peasants' Revolt|Tyler’s Rebellion]] in England in 1381, put pressure on the nobility and the clergy to reform the system. As a result, the gradual establishment of new forms of land leases and increased personal liberties accommodated serf and peasant demands to some extent.

An important factor in the decline of serfdom was industrial development—especially the [[Industrial Revolution]]. With the growing profitability of [[industry]], farmers wanted to move to towns to receive higher wages than those they could earn working in the fields,{{cn|date=December 2016}} while landowners also invested in the more profitable industry. This also led to the growing process of [[urbanization]].{{Multiple image

Serfdom reached [[Eastern Europe]] centuries later than Western Europe—it became dominant around the 15th century. Before that time, Eastern Europe had been much more sparsely populated than Western Europe, and the lords of Eastern Europe created a peasantry-friendly environment to encourage migration east.{{cn|date=December 2016}}  Serfdom developed in Eastern Europe after the [[Black Death]] epidemics of the mid-14th century, which stopped the eastward migration.  The resulting high land-to-labour ratio - combined with Eastern Europe's vast, sparsely populated areas - gave the lords an incentive to bind the remaining peasantry to their land. With increased demand for agricultural produce in Western Europe during the later era when Western Europe limited and eventually abolished serfdom, serfdom remained in force throughout Eastern Europe during the 17th century so that nobility-owned estates could produce more agricultural products (especially [[cereal|grain]]) for the profitable export market.

This pattern applied in Central and Eastern European countries, including [[Prussia]] ([[Prussian Ordinances]] of 1525), [[Austria]], [[Hungary]] (laws of the late 15th and early 16th centuries), the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] ([[szlachta]] privileges of the early 16th century) and the [[Russian Empire]] (laws of the late 16th and first half of the 17th century). This also led to the slower industrial development and urbanisation of those regions.  Generally, this process, referred to{{by whom?|date=December 2016}} as "second serfdom" or "export-led serfdom", persisted until the mid-19th century and became very repressive and substantially limited serfs' rights. Before the 1861 abolition of serfdom in Russia, a landowner's estate was often measured by the number of "souls" he owned, a practice made famous by Gogol's 1842 novel ''[[Dead Souls]]''.

Many of these countries abolished serfdom during the [[Napoleonic wars|Napoleonic invasions]] of the early 19th century. Serfdom remained in force in most of Russia until the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]], enacted on February 19, 1861, though in the Russian-controlled [[Governorate of Livonia|Baltic provinces]] it had been abolished at the beginning of the 19th century. According to the Russian census of 1857, [[Russian serfdom|Russia had 23.1 million private serfs]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Russian serfdom]] was perhaps the most notable Eastern European institution, as it was never influenced by German law and migrations,{{cn|date=December 2016}} and serfdom and the [[manorialism|manorial]] system were enforced by the crown ([[Tsar]]), not by the nobility.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

==Decline==

In Western Europe serfdom became progressively less common through the Middle Ages, particularly after the [[Black Death]] reduced the rural population and increased the bargaining power of workers. Furthermore, the lords of many manors were willing (for payment) to ''manumit'' ("release") their serfs.

In [[Normandy]], serfdom had disappeared by 1100.&lt;ref&gt;Sept essais sur des Aspects de la société et de l'économie dans la Normandie médiévale (Xe-XIIIe siècles) 
Lucien Musset, Jean-Michel Bouvris, Véronique Gazea, Cahier des Annales de Normandie 1988, Volume 22, Issue   22, pp. 3-140&lt;/ref&gt; Two possible causes of the disappearance of serfdom in Normandy have been proposed: (1) it might have been implemented to attract peasants to a Normandy depopulated by the Viking invasions or (2) it might be a result of the peasants' revolt of 996 in Normandy.

In [[England]], the end of serfdom began with the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381. It had largely died out in England by 1500 as a personal status and was fully ended when [[Elizabeth I]] freed the last remaining serfs in 1574.&lt;ref name="1902encyclopedia" /&gt; Land held by serf tenure (unless enfranchised) continued to be held by what was thenceforth known as a [[copyhold|copyhold tenancy]], which was not completely abolished until 1925 (although it was whittled away during the 19th and early 20th centuries). There were native-born [[Scotland|Scottish]] serfs until 1799, when coal miners who were kept in serfdom gained [[emancipation]]. However, most Scottish serfs had already been freed.

Serfdom was ''de facto'' ended in France by [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]], [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] (1315), and [[Philip V of France|Philip V]] (1318).&lt;ref name="1902encyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.1902encyclopedia.com/S/SLA/slavery-12.html 1902encyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Druon, Le Roi de fer, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of a few isolated cases, serfdom had ceased to exist in France by the 15th century. In Early Modern France, [[French nobility|French nobles]] nevertheless maintained a great number of [[Manorialism|seigneurial privileges]] over the [[Freehold (law)|free]] peasants that worked lands under their control. Serfdom was formally abolished in [[France]] in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Serfdom Serfdom LoveToKnow 1911] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527113728/http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Serfdom |date=2013-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other parts of Europe, there had been [[popular revolt in late medieval Europe|peasant revolts]] in Castille, Germany, northern France, Portugal, and Sweden. Although they were often successful, it usually took a long time before legal systems were changed.

===Era of the French Revolution===
The era of the [[French Revolution]] (1790s to 1820s) saw serfdom abolished in most of Western Europe, while its practice remained common in Eastern Europe for another century or more. In France, serfdom had been in decline for at least three centuries by the start of the Revolution, replaced by various forms of freehold tenancy. The last vestiges of serfdom were officially ended on August 4, 1789 with a decree abolishing the feudal rights of the nobility.

It removed the authority of the manorial courts, eliminated tithes and manorial dues, and freed those who still remained bound to the land. However, the decree was mostly symbolic, as widespread peasant revolts had effectively ended the feudal system beforehand; and ownership of the land still remained in the hands of the landlords, who could continue collecting rents and enforcing tenant contracts.

[[Image:Freilassungsbrief Weymann.jpg|thumb|200px|End of serfdom: a German „Freilassungsbrief“ (Letter for the End of a serfdom) from 1762.]]

In [[History of Germany|German history]] the emancipation of the serfs came in 1770-1830, beginning with [[Schleswig]] in 1780. [[Prussia]] abolished serfdom with the "[[October Edict]]" of 1807, which upgraded the personal legal status of the peasantry and gave them ownership of half or two-thirds of the lands they were working. The edict applied to all peasants whose holdings were above a certain size, and included both Crown lands and noble estates. The peasants were freed from the obligation of personal services to the lord and annual dues; in return landowners were given ownership of 1/3 to 1/2 of the land. The peasant owned and rented the lands that were deeded to the old owners. The other German states imitated Prussia after 1815.&lt;ref name="Ewa Sagarra pp 341-45"&gt;Ewa Sagarra, ''A social history of Germany,'' pp 341-45&lt;/ref&gt;

In sharp contrast to the violence that characterized land reform in the French Revolution, Germany handled it peacefully. In Schleswig the peasants, who had been influenced by [[the Enlightenment]], played an active role; elsewhere they were largely passive. Indeed, for most peasants, customs and traditions continued largely unchanged, including the old habits of deference to the nobles whose legal authority remained quite strong over the villagers. The old paternalistic relationship in East Prussia lasted into the 20th century. What was new was that the peasant could now sell his land, enabling him to move to the city, or buy up the land of his neighbors.&lt;ref name="Ewa Sagarra pp 341-45"/&gt;

The land reforms in northwestern Germany were driven by progressive governments and local elites. They abolished feudal obligations and divided collectively owned common land into private parcels and thus created a more efficient market-oriented rural economy. It produced increased productivity and population growth. It strengthened the traditional social order because wealthy peasants obtained most of the former common land, while the rural proletariat was left without land; many left for the cities or America. Meanwhile, the division of the common land served as a buffer preserving social peace between nobles and peasants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stefan |last=Brakensiek |title=Agrarian Individualism in North-Western Germany, 1770-1870 |journal=German History |year=1994 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=137–179 |doi=10.1093/gh/12.2.137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; East of the [[Elbe River]], the [[Junker|Junker class]] maintained large estates and monopolized political power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. A. |last=Perkins |title=Dualism in German Agrarian Historiography |journal=[[Comparative Studies in Society and History]] |year=1986 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=287–330 |doi=10.1017/S0010417500013876 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eradication of the feudal system marks the beginning of an era of rapid change in Europe. The change in status following the [[enclosure movement]]s beginning in the later 18th century, in which various lords abandoned the open field farming of previous centuries and, essentially, took all the best land for themselves in exchange for "freeing" their serfs, may well have made serfdom seem more desirable to many peasant families.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In his book ''[[Das Kapital]]'', in Chapter 26 entitled "The Secret of Primitive Accumulation" and Chapter 27, "Expropriation of the Agricultural Population from the Land", [[Karl Marx|Marx]] claimed that the feudal relationships of serfdom were violently transformed into private property and free labour: free of possession and free to sell their labour force on the market. Being liberated from serfdom meant being able to sell one's land and work wherever one desired. "The so-called primitive accumulation, therefore, is nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the producer from the means of production. It appears as primitive, because it forms the pre-historic stage of capital and of the mode of production corresponding with it."

In a case history of England, Marx described how the serfs became free peasant proprietors and small farmers, who were, over time, forcibly expropriated and driven off the land, forming a property-less [[proletariat]]. He also claimed that more and more legislation was enacted by the state to control and regiment this new class of [[wage labour|wage workers]]. In the meantime, the remaining farmers became capitalist farmers operating more and more on a commercial basis; and gradually, legal monopolies preventing trade and investment by [[entrepreneur]]s were broken up.

Taxes levied by the state took the place of labour dues levied by the lord. Although serfdom began its decline in Europe in the Middle Ages, it took many hundreds of years to disappear completely. In addition, the struggles of the working class during the Industrial Revolution can often be compared with the struggles of the serfs during the Middle Ages. In parts of the world today, [[unfree labour|forced labour]] is still used. [[Image:Galician slaughter in 1846.PNG|thumb|300px|right|"[[Galician slaughter]]" 1846, by [[Jan Lewicki]] (1795-1871); "directed against manorial property (for example, the manorial prisons) and rising against serfdom;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bideleux and Ian Jeffries, A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change, Routledge, 1998. {{ISBN|0-415-16111-8}}. p. 295 – 296.&lt;/ref&gt; Galician, mainly Polish, peasants killed over 1000 noblemen and destroyed 500 manors in 1846."]]

===Russia===
{{main|Serfdom in Russia| Emancipation Reform of 1861}}
Serfdom became the dominant form of relation between Russian peasants and nobility in the 17th century. Serfdom only existed in central and southern areas of the Russian Empire. It was never established in the North, in the Urals, nor in Siberia. Historian David Moon argues that serfdom was a response to military and economic factors in Russia. It was socially stable and adaptable to changing demographic and economic conditions; revolts were uncommon. Moon says it was not the cause of Russia's backwardness; instead, backwardness blocked alternative methods that were developed in Western Europe. Moon identifies some benefits for serfs, such as assurances of land and some assistance after bad harvests. Moon argues that Russia's defeat in the Crimean War was a catalyst leading to the abolition of serfdom.&lt;ref&gt;David Moon, "Reassessing Russian serfdom," ''European History Quarterly'' (1996) 26#4 pp 483-526&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Moon, ''The Russian peasantry 1600-1930: the world the peasants made'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, serfdom was abolished by a decree issued by Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] in 1861. Scholars have proposed multiple overlapping reasons to account for the abolition, including fear of a large-scale revolt by the serfs, the financial needs of the government, evolving cultural sensibilities, the military need for soldiers, and, among Marxists, the unprofitability of serfdom.&lt;ref&gt;Evsey D. Domar, and Mark J. Machina, "On the profitability of Russian serfdom." ''Journal of Economic History'' (1984) 44#4 pp: 919-955. [http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~mmachina/papers/Domar-Machina_Serfdom_Paper.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948''', sometimes known as the '''First Kashmir War''', was fought between [[Union of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] over the [[princely state]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] from 1947 to 1948. It was the first of four [[Indo-Pakistan Wars]] fought between the two [[Partition of India|newly independent nations]]. Pakistan precipitated the war a few weeks after independence by launching tribal ''lashkar'' (militia) from [[Waziristan]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/~jns/publications/Understanding%20Support%20for%20Islamist%20Militancy.pdf Pakistan Covert Operations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912114721/http://www.princeton.edu/~jns/publications/Understanding%20Support%20for%20Islamist%20Militancy.pdf |date=12 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to secure Kashmir, the future of which hung in the balance. The inconclusive result of the war still affects the geopolitics of both countries.

The [[Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir|Maharaja]] faced an [[1947 Poonch Rebellion|uprising by his Muslim subjects]] in [[Historical Poonch District|Poonch]], and lost control of the western districts of his kingdom.

==Background==
{{Further information|History of Kashmir}}
Prior to 1815, the area now known as "Jammu and Kashmir" comprised 22 small independent states (16 Hindu and six Muslim) carved out of territories controlled by the Amir (King) of [[Afghanistan]], combined with those of local small rulers. These were collectively referred to as the "Punjab Hill States". These small states, ruled by [[Rajput|Rajput kings]], were variously independent, vassals of the [[Mughal Empire]] since the time of [[Akbar|Emperor Akbar]] or sometimes controlled from [[Kangra State|Kangra state]] in the Himachal area. Following the decline of the Mughals, turbulence in Kangra and invasions of Gorkhas, the hill states fell successively under the control of the Sikhs under [[Ranjit Singh]].&lt;ref name="HutchisonVogel1933"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutchison|first1=J.|last2=Vogel|first2=Jean Philippe|title=History of the Panjab Hill States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uXgQwAACAAJ|accessdate=23 October 2011|year=1933|publisher=Superint., Gov. Print., Punjab}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|536}}

The [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] (1845–46) was fought between the [[Sikh Empire]], which asserted sovereignty over [[Kashmir]], and the [[East India Company]]. In the [[Treaty of Lahore]] of 1846, the Sikhs were made to surrender the valuable region (the Jullundur Doab) between the [[Beas River]] and the [[Sutlej River]] and required to pay an indemnity of 1.2 million rupees. Because they could not readily raise this sum, the East India Company allowed the [[Dogra]] ruler [[Gulab Singh]] to acquire Kashmir from the Sikh kingdom in exchange for making a payment of 750,000 rupees to the Company. Gulab Singh became the first [[Maharaja]] of the newly formed [[princely state]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir]],&lt;ref name="Srinagar"&gt;[https://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/g/019pho000000394u00076000.html Srinagar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072804/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/g/019pho000000394u00076000.html |date=4 March 2016 }} www.collectbritain.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt; founding a [[The Royal House of Jammu and Kashmir|dynasty]], that was to rule the state, the second-largest principality during the [[British Raj]], until India gained its independence in 1947.

==Partition of India==
{{Main article|Partition of India}}
[[File:Partition of India 1947 en.svg|thumb|right|Partition of India and the movement of refugees]]
The years 1946–1947 saw the rise of [[All-India Muslim League]] and [[Muslim nationalism in South Asia|Muslim nationalism]], demanding a separate state for India's Muslims. The demand took a violent turn on the [[Direct Action Day]] (16 August 1946) and inter-communal violence between Hindus and Muslims became endemic. Consequently, a decision was taken on 3 June 1947 to divide [[British India]] into two separate states, the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] comprising the Muslim majority areas and the [[Union of India]] comprising the rest. The two provinces [[Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] with large Muslim-majority areas were to be divided between the two dominions. An estimated 11 million people eventually migrated between the two parts of Punjab, and possibly 1 million perished in the inter-communal violence. Jammu and Kashmir, being adjacent to the Punjab province, was directly affected by the happenings in Punjab.

[[File:Auchinleck.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Field Marshal [[Claude Auchinleck]], Supreme Commander of Indian and Pakistani armed forces]]
The original target date for the transfer of power to the new dominions was June 1948. However, fearing the rise of inter-communal violence, the British Viceroy [[Lord Mountbatten]] advanced the date to 15 August 1947. This gave only 6 weeks to complete all the arrangements for partition.{{sfn|Hodson, The Great Divide|1969|pp=293,&amp;nbsp;320}} Mountbatten's original plan was to stay on the joint Governor General for both the dominions till June 1948. However, this was not accepted by the Pakistani leader [[Mohammad Ali Jinnah]]. In the event, Mountbatten stayed on as the Governor General of India, whereas Pakistan chose Jinnah as its Governor General.{{sfn|Hodson, The Great Divide|1969|pp=293,&amp;nbsp;329–330}} It was envisaged that the nationalisation of the armed forces could not be completed by 15 August.{{efn|At the beginning of 1947, all the posts above the rank of lieutenant colonel in the army were held by British officers.{{sfn|Sarila, The Shadow of the Great Game|2007|p=324}} Pakistan had only four lieutenant colonels,{{sfn|Barua, Gentlemen of the Raj|2003|p=133}} two of whom were involved in the Kashmir conflict: Akbar Khan and Sher Khan.{{sfn|Nawaz, The First Kashmir War Revisited|2008}} At the beginning of the war, India had about 500 British officers and Pakistan over 1000.{{sfn|Ankit, Kashmir, 1945–66|2014|p=43}}}} Hence British officers stayed on after the transfer of power. The service chiefs were appointed by the Dominion governments and were responsible to them. The overall administrative control, but not operational control, was vested with Field Marshal [[Claude Auchinleck]], who was titled the 'Supreme Commander', answerable to a newly formed Joint Defence Council of the two dominions. India appointed General [[Rob Lockhart]] as its Army chief and Pakistan appointed General [[Frank Messervy]].{{sfn|Hodson, The Great Divide|1969|pp=262–265}}

The presence of the British commanding officers on both sides made the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 a strange war. The two commanding officers were in daily telephone contact and adopted mutually defensive positions. The attitude was that "you can hit them so hard but not too hard, otherwise there will be all kinds of repercussions."{{sfn|Ankit, Kashmir, 1945–66|2014|pp=54,&amp;nbsp;56}} Both Lockhart and Messervy were replaced in the course of war, and their successors [[Roy Bucher]] and [[Douglas Gracey]] tried to exercise restraint on their respective governments. Roy Bucher was apparently successful in doing so in India, but Gracey yielded and let British officers be used in operational roles on the side of Pakistan. One British officer even died in action.{{sfn|Ankit, Kashmir, 1945–66|2014|pp=57–58}}

==Developments in Jammu and Kashmir (August–October 1947)==
[[File:Sir Hari Singh Bahadur, Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, 1944.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Maharaja Hari Singh]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]]]]
With the independence of the Dominions, the [[British Paramountcy]] over the princely states came to an end. The rulers of the states were advised to join one of the two dominions by executing an [[Instrument of Accession]]. [[Maharaja Hari Singh]] of Jammu and Kashmir, along with his prime minister [[Ram Chandra Kak]], decided not to accede to either dominion. The reasons cited were that the Muslim majority population of the State would not be comfortable with joining India, and that the Hindu and Sikh minorities would become vulnerable if the state joined Pakistan.{{sfn|Ankit, Henry Scott|2010|p=45}}

In 1947, the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir had a wide range of ethnic and religious communities. The [[Kashmir Division|Kashmir province]] consisting of the [[Kashmir Valley]] and the [[Muzaffarabad district]] had a majority Muslim population (over 90%). The [[Jammu Division|Jammu province]], consisting of 5 districts, had a roughly equal division of Hindus and Muslims in the eastern districts ([[Udhampur]], [[Jammu]] and [[Reasi]]) and Muslim majority in the western districts ([[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]] and [[Poonch]]). The mountainous [[Ladakh]] district (''wazarat'') in the east had a significant Buddhist presence with a Muslim majority in [[Baltistan]]. The [[Gilgit Agency]] in the north was overwhelmingly Muslim and was directly governed by the British under an agreement with the Maharaja. Shortly before the transfer of power, the British returned the Gilgit Agency to the Maharaja, who appointed a [[Dogra]] governor for the district and a British commander for the local forces.


The predominant political movement in the Kashmir Valley, the [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir National Conference|National Conference]] led by [[Sheikh Abdullah]], believed in secular politics. It was allied with the [[Indian National Congress]] and was believed to favour joining India. On the other hand, the Muslims of the Jammu province supported the [[Muslim Conference]], which was allied to the [[All-India Muslim League]] and favoured joining Pakistan. The Hindus of the Jammu province favoured an outright merger with India.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Balraj |last=Puri |authorlink=Balraj Puri |title=The Question of Accession |journal=Epilogue |volume=4 |number=11 |pp=4–6 |date=November 2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMxJzb7N_8wC&amp;pg=PA4 |ref={{sfnref|Puri, The Question of Accession|2010}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the midst of all the diverging views, the Maharaja's decision to remain independent was apparently a judicious one.{{sfn|Ankit, Henry Scott|2010}}

According to Indian military sources, the Pakistani Army prepared a plan called '''Operation Gulmarg''' and put it into action as early as 20 August, a few days after Pakistan's independence. The plan got accidentally revealed to an Indian officer, Major O. S. Kalkat serving with the [[Bannu Brigade]].{{efn|Major Kalkat was the [[Brigade Major]] at the [[Bannu Brigade]], who opened a Demi-Official letter marked "Personal/Top Secret" on 20 August 1947 signed by General [[Frank Messervy]], the then Commander in Chief of the Pakistan Army. It was addressed to Kalkat's commanding officer Brig. C. P. Murray, who happened to be away at another post. The Pakistani officials suspected Kalkat and placed him under house arrest. He escaped and made his way to New Delhi on 18 October. However, the Indian military authorities and defence minister did not believe his information. He was recalled and debriefed on 24 October after the tribal invasion of Kashmir had started.{{sfn|Prasad &amp; Pal, Operations in Jammu &amp; Kashmir |1987 |p=17}}}} According to the plan, 20 ''lashkars'' (tribal militias), each consisting of 1000 Pashtun tribesmen, were to be recruited from among various Pashtun tribes, and armed at the brigade headquarters at [[Bannu]], [[Wanna, Pakistan|Wanna]], [[Peshawar]], [[Kohat]], [[Thall]] and [[Nowshera, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]] by the first week of September. They were expected to reach the launching point of [[Abbottabad]] on 18 October, and cross into Jammu and Kashmir on 22 October. Ten lashkars were expected to attack the [[Kashmir Valley]] through [[Muzaffarabad]] and another ten lashkars were expected to join the rebels in [[Poonch]], [[Bhimber]] and [[Rawalakot]] with a view to advance to [[Jammu]]. Detailed arrangements for the military leadership and armaments were described in the plan.{{sfn|Prasad &amp; Pal, Operations in Jammu &amp; Kashmir |1987 |pp=17–19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kalkat |first=Onkar S. |title=The Far-flung Frontiers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWO5AAAAIAAJ |publisher=Allied Publishers |year=1983 |pp=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regimental records show that, by the last week of August, the [[21st Prince Albert Victor’s Own Cavalry (Frontier Force)|Prince Albert Victor's Own Cavalry]] (PAVO Cavalry) regiment was briefed about the invasion plan. Colonel Sher Khan,  the Director of Military Intelligence, was in charge of the briefing, along with Colonels Akbar Khan and  Khanzadah. The Cavalry regiment was tasked with procuring arms and ammunition for the 'freedom fighters' and establishing three wings of the insurgent forces: the South Wing commanded by General Kiani, a Central Wing based at Rawalpinidi and a North Wing based at Abbottabad. By 1 October, the Cavalry regiment completed the task of arming the insurgent forces. "Throughout the war there was no shortage of small arms, ammunitions, or explosives at any time." The regiment was also told to be on stand by for induction into fighting at an appropriate time.{{sfnp|Effendi, Punjab Cavalry|2007|pp=151–153}}{{sfnp|Joshi, Kashmir, 1947-1965: A Story Retold|2008|p=59–}}&lt;ref name="Wajahat review"&gt;{{citation |last=Amin |first=Agha Humayun |chapter=Memories of a Soldier by Major General Syed Wajahat Hussain (Book Review) |title=Pakistan Military Review, Volume 18 |date=August 2015 |ISBN=978-1516850235 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform | |chapter-url=https://www.slideshare.net/AAmin1/pakistan-military-review-volume-18-inside-waziristan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have noted considerable movement of Pashtun tribes during September–October. By 13 September, armed Pashtuns drifted into Lahore and Rawalpindi. The Deputy Commissioner of [[Dera Ismail Khan]] noted a scheme to send tribesmen from [[Malakand Agency|Malakand]] to [[Sialkot]], in lorries provided by the Pakistan Government. Preparations for attacking Kashmir were also noted in the princely states of [[Swat (princely state)|Swat]], [[Dir (princely state)|Dir]], and [[Chitral (princely state)|Chitral]]. Scholar Robin James Moore states there is "little doubt" that Pashtuns were involved in border raids all along the Punjab border from the [[Indus River|Indus]] to the [[Ravi River|Ravi]].{{sfn|Moore, Making the new Commonwealth|1987|p=49}}

Pakistani sources deny the existence of any plan called Operation Gulmarg. However, Shuja Nawaz does list 22 Pashtun tribes involved in the invasion of Kashmir on 22 October.{{sfn|Nawaz, The First Kashmir War Revisited|2008|p=124–125}}

===Rebellion in Poonch===
{{Main article|1947 Poonch Rebellion}}
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Sardar M. Ibrahim Khan.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Sardar Ibrahim]], Leader of the [[Muslim Conference]] in [[Historical Poonch District|Poonch]]]] --&gt;
Sometime in August 1947, the first signs of trouble broke out in [[Historical Poonch District|Poonch]], about which diverging views have been received. Poonch was originally an internal ''jagir'' (autonomous principality), governed by an alternative family line of Maharaja Hari Singh. The taxation is said to have been heavy. The Muslims of Poonch had long campaigned for the principality to be absorbed into the Punjab province of British India. In 1938, a notable disturbance occurred for religious reasons, but a settlement was reached.{{sfn|Ankit, The Problem of Poonch|2010|p=8}} During the Second World War, over 60,000 men from Poonch and Mirpur districts enrolled in the British Indian Army. After the war, they were discharged with arms, which is said to have alarmed the Maharaja.{{sfn|Schofield, Kashmir in Conflict|2003|p=41}} In June, Poonchis launched a 'No Tax' campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=squHDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=State, Community and Neighbourhood in Princely North India, c. 1900-1950, By I. Copland.|last=|first=|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, the Maharaja ordered that all the soldiers in the region be disarmed.{{efn|Under the Jammu and Kashmir Arms Act of 1940, the possession of all fire arms was prohibited in the state.

According to state government sources, the rebellious militias gathered in the Naoshera-Islamabad area, attacking the state troops and their supply trucks. A battalion of state troops was dispatched, which cleared the roads and dispersed the militias. By September, order was reestablished.{{sfn|Ankit, The Problem of Poonch|2010|p=9}}  The Muslim Conference sources, on the other hand, narrate that hundreds of people were killed in [[Bagh, Azad Kashmir|Bagh]] during flag hoisting around 15 August and that the Maharaja unleased a 'reign of terror' on 24 August. Local Muslims also told Richard Symonds, a British Quaker social worker, that the army fired on crowds, and burnt houses and villages indiscriminately.{{sfn|Snedden, Kashmir: The Unwritten History|2013|p=42}} According to the Assistant British High Commissioner in Pakistan, H. S. Stephenson, "the Poonch affair... was greatly exaggerated".{{sfn|Ankit, The Problem of Poonch|2010|p=9}}

===Pakistan's preparations, Maharaja's manoeuvring===
Scholar [[Prem Shankar Jha]] states that the Maharaja had decided, as early as April 1947, that he would accede to India if it was not possible to stay independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Jha |first=Prem Shankar |authorlink=Prem Shankar Jha |title=Response (to the reviews of ''The Origins of a Dispute: Kashmir 1947'') |journal=Commonwealth and Comparative Politics |volume=36 |number=1 |date=March 1998 |DOI=10.1080/14662049808447762 |subscription=yes |pp=113–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|115}} The rebellion in Poonch possibly unnerved the Maharaja. Accordingly, on 11 August, he dismissed his pro-Pakistan Prime Minister, Ram Chandra Kak, and appointed retired Major [[Janak Singh]] in his place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5KMCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Understanding Kashmir and Kashmiris|last=Snedden|first=Christopher|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 August, he sent an invitation to Justice [[Mehr Chand Mahajan]] of the Punjab High Court to come as the Prime Minister.{{sfn|Mahajan, Looking Back|1963|p=123}} On the same day, the Muslim Conference wrote to the Pakistani Prime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] warning him that "if, God forbid, the Pakistan Government or the Muslim League do not act, Kashmir might be lost to them".{{sfn|Raghavan, War and Peace in Modern India|2010|p=103}} This set the ball rolling in Pakistan.

[[File:Liaquat Ali Khan.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Liaquat Ali Khan]], Prime Minister of Pakistan]]
Liaquat Ali Khan sent a Punjab politician [[Mian Iftikharuddin]] to explore the possibility of organising a revolt in Kashmir.{{sfn|Bhattacharya, What Price Freedom|2013|pp=25-27}} Meanwhile, Pakistan cut off essential supplies to the state, such as petrol, sugar and salt. It also stopped trade in timber and other products, and suspended train services to Jammu.{{sfn|Ankit, October 1947|2010|p=9}}{{sfn|Jamal, Shadow War|2009|p=50}} Iftikharuddin returned in mid-September to report that the National Conference held strong in the Kashmir Valley and ruled out the possibility of a revolt.

[[File:Murree Richtone(HDR).jpg|thumb|left|[[Murree]], overlooking Kashmir]]
Meanwhile, Sardar Ibrahim had escaped to West Punjab, along with dozens of rebels, and established a base in [[Murree]]. From there, the rebels attempted to acquire arms and ammunition for the rebellion and smuggle them into Kashmir. Colonel [[Akbar Khan (Pakistani general)|Akbar Khan]], one of a handful of high-ranking officers in the Pakistani Army,{{efn|According to scholar [[Christine Fair]], at the time of independence, Pakistan had one major general, two brigadiers, and six colonels, even though the requirements were for 13 major generals, 40 brigadiers, and 52 colonels.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Fair |first=C.

He arranged 4,000 rifles for the rebellion by diverting them from the Army stores. He also wrote out a draft plan titled ''Armed Revolt inside Kashmir'' and gave it to Mian Iftikharuddin to be passed on to the Pakistan's Prime Minister.{{sfn|Guha, India after Gandhi|2008|loc=Section 4.II}}{{sfn|Raghavan, War and Peace in Modern India|2010|pp=105-106}}{{sfn|Nawaz, The First Kashmir War Revisited|2008|p=120}}

On 12 September, the Prime Minister held a meeting with Mian Iftikharuddin, Colonel Akbar Khan and another Punjab politician Sardar [[Shaukat Hayat Khan]]. Hayat Khan had a separate plan, involving the [[Muslim League National Guard]] and the militant Pashtun tribes from the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|Frontier regions]]. The Prime Minister approved both the plans, and despatched [[Khurshid Anwar (Major)|Khurshid Anwar]], the head of the Muslim League National Guard, to mobilise the Frontier tribes.{{sfn|Raghavan, War and Peace in Modern India|2010|pp=105-106}}{{sfn|Nawaz, The First Kashmir War Revisited|2008|p=120}}

[[File:Jawaharlal Nehru 1946.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Jawaharlal Nehru]], Prime Minister of India]]
The Maharaja was increasingly driven to the wall with the rebellion in the western districts and the Pakistani blockade. He managed to persuade Justice Mahajan to accept the post of Prime Minister (but not to arrive for another month, for procedural reasons). He sent word to the Indian leaders through Mahajan that he was willing to accede to India but needed more time to implement political reforms. However, it was India's position that it would not accept accession from the Maharaja unless it had the people's support. The Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] demanded that Sheikh Abdullah should be released from prison and involved in the state's government. Accession could only be contemplated afterwards. Following further negotiations, Sheikh Abdullah was released on 29 September.{{sfn|Raghavan, War and Peace in Modern India|2010|p=106}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Victoria Schofield|title=Kashmir in Conflict: India, Pakistan and the Unending War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkTetMfI6QkC|year=2000|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-898-4|page=44|quote=Nehru therefore suggested to Patel that the maharaja should 'make friends with the National Conference, 'so that there might be this popular support against Pakistan'. Nehru had hoped that the maharaja could be persuaded to accede to India before any invasion took place and he realised that accession would only be more easilly accepted if Abdullah, as a popular leader, were brought into the picture.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nehru, foreseeing a number of disputes over princely states, formulated a policy that states 
{{quote|"wherever there is a dispute in regard to any territory, the matter should be decided by a referendum or plebiscite of the people concerned. We shall accept the result of this referendum whatever it may be."{{sfn|Raghavan, War and Peace in Modern India|2010|pp=49–51}}{{sfn|Dasgupta, War and Diplomacy in Kashmir|2014|pp=28–29}}}}
The policy was communicated to Liaquat Ali Khan on 1 October at a meeting of the Joint Defence Council. Khan's eyes are said to have "sparkled" at the proposal. However, he made no response.{{sfn|Raghavan, War and Peace in Modern India|2010|pp=49–51}}{{sfn|Dasgupta, War and Diplomacy in Kashmir|2014|pp=28–29}}

The historian Rakesh Ankit explains this promise of plebiscite as having been made in the context of Nehru's confidence in the pro-India position and popularity of Sheikh Abdullah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ankit|first1=Rakesh|title=America, India, and Kashmir, 1945–49: “If Ignorance About India in This Country is Deep, Ignorance About the [Princely] States is Abysmal”|journal=Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft|date=2016|volume=27|issue=1|pages=24-25|quote=Having faith in Abdullah’s popularity and desire to integrate with India, Nehru also promised a plebiscite in Kashmir under United Nations [UN] auspices. However, New Delhi never risked testing Kashmiri political allegiance on the altar of their national self-determination and religious identity and, by 1949–1950, intelligence reports “disabused [New Delhi] of this mid- summer madness to believe we can win a plebiscite.” For independent India, like its British predecessor, Kashmir was of strategic value but, for Nehru, it also held importance ideologically as a secular exemplar vis-à-vis Islamic Pakistan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; the Maharaja asked for Indian military assistance. Mountbatten urged him to accede to India temporarily to complete the legal formalities, although Mountbatten's insistence on accession before assistance has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Victoria Schofield|title=Kashmir in Conflict: India, Pakistan and the Unending War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaT3AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT74|date=30 May 2010|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85773-078-7|pages=74–|quote=Mountbatten's insistence on accession before assistance has, however, also been questioned. As Joseph Korbel noted, the Indian government had already promised arms and weapons to counter the spreading rebellion in Poonch; although; these had not arrived, there was no demand then for accession to be a conditon upon receiving assistance. Despite Mountbatten's fear of a full-scale war, involving British officers on opposing sides, how could he have reasoned that it was necessary for Jammu and Kashmir - technically an independent country - to accede first before receiving military assistance? Why was no apeal made to the United Nations for assistance at that time? And why did no one suggest getting in touch with the Pakistani government in Karachi for consultation? No convincing explanation has been offered: "It is hard to understand why Mountbatten attached such importance to immediate accession,' concludes Philip Ziegler, Mountbatten's official biographer. 'If there had been no accession, the Indian presence in Kashmir would have been more evidently temporary, the possibility of a properly constituted referendum would have become more real.

However, the Indian and Pakistani forces were still under a joint command, and [[Field Marshal Auchinleck]] prevailed upon him to withdraw the order.

Does this vindicate the Indian Government's claim that the Maharaja's subsequent accession to India had majority support? It might, if we knew precisely what the two parties wanted, and if we could be sure that they spoke, collectively, for the Kashmiri people. But the precisely what the two parties wanted, and if we could be sure that they spoke, collectively, for the Kashmiri people. But the intentions of the party leaders in 1947 are obscure and their representativeness questionable. To take the second point first, support for Pakistan in Kashmir was by no means co-extensive with support for the MC. On the one hand some Kashmiris appear to have adopted Abbas party' mainly out of respect for Jinnah and as a vehicle through which to 'express their sentiment about Pakistan and the Muslim League'. As Ghulam Muhammad noted in a letter to Jinnah: 'The people of Srinagar are League-struck even...though they neither had nor have any faith in Mirwaiz'. On the other hand, many NC followers seem to have divided up their allegiance, acknowledging Abdullah as their leader 'up to Kohala' - that is, locally- and Jinnah beyond. Saraf remembers that it 'was a common sight in the 1940s to find the photographs of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and those of Allama Iqbal and Quaid-e-Azam hanging side by side in the houses or business premises of supporters of the National Conference; while League member Samseenuddin Khan, who visited Kashmir in 1945, found that the 'jewellers and ordinary folk' he spoke to regarded themselves as 'under the banner of the Muslim League' and staunch disciples of 'the Congress leader Sheikh Abdullah'.|access-date=26 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726214858/https://books.google.com/books?id=VaeuCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA219|archive-date=26 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages of the war==
[[File:J&amp;K01low.jpg|right|thumb|300px|State defence of the Kashmir Valley 22 October 1947&amp;nbsp;– 26 October 1947]]
===Initial invasion===

The first clash occurred at [[Thorar]] on 3–4 October 1947.&lt;ref name="reg history"/&gt;
On 22 October another attack was launched in the Muzaffarabad sector. The state forces stationed in the border regions around [[Muzaffarabad]] and [[Domel]] were quickly defeated by tribal forces (some Muslim state forces mutinied and joined them) and the way to the capital was open. Among the raiders, there were many active Pakistani Army soldiers disguised as tribals. They were also provided logistical help by the Pakistan Army. Rather than advancing toward Srinagar before state forces could regroup or be reinforced, the invading forces remained in the captured cities in the border region engaging in looting and other crimes against their inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Cooper, [http://www.acig.info/CMS/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=159 I Indo-Pakistani War, 1947–1949] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002104334/http://www.acig.info/CMS/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=159 |date=2 October 2016 }}, Air Combat Information Group, 29 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Poonch|Poonch valley]], the state forces retreated into towns where they were besieged.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Defence, Government of India.

===Indian operation in the Kashmir Valley===

After the accession, India airlifted troops and equipment to Srinagar under the command of Lt. col. [[Dewan Ranjit Rai]], where they reinforced the princely state forces, established a defence perimeter and defeated the tribal forces on the outskirts of the city. Initial defense operations included the notable defense of [[Battle of Badgam|Badgam]] holding both the capital and airfield overnight against extreme odds. The successful defence included an outflanking manoeuvre by Indian [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiandefencereview.com/interviews/defence-of-srinagar-1947/|title=Defence of Srinagar 1947|work=Indian Defence Review|accessdate=3 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318174203/http://www.indiandefencereview.com/interviews/defence-of-srinagar-1947/|archivedate=18 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the Battle of Shalateng. The defeated tribal forces were pursued as far as [[Baramulla]] and [[Uri (India)|Uri]] and these towns, too, were recaptured.

In the Poonch valley, tribal forces continued to besiege state forces.

In [[Gilgit]], the state paramilitary forces, called the [[Gilgit Scouts]], joined the invading tribal forces, who thereby obtained control of this northern region of the state. The tribal forces were also joined by troops from [[Chitral (princely state)|Chitral]], whose ruler, [[Muzaffar ul-Mulk]] the Mehtar of Chitral, had acceded to Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8N7sAAAAMAAJ|title=Persistence and transformation in the Eastern Hindu Kush: a study of resource management systems in Mehlp Valley, Chitral, North Pakistan|last=Rahman|first=Fazlur|date=2007-01-01|publisher=In Kommission bei Asgard-Verlag|year=|isbn=|location=|page=32|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8cPvqCNy8zsC|title=Pakistan|last=Wilcox|first=Wayne Ayres|date=1963-01-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5KMCwAAQBAJ|title=Understanding Kashmir and Kashmiris|last=Snedden|first=Christopher|date=2015-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9781849043427|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attempted link-up at Poonch and fall of Mirpur===

Indian forces ceased pursuit of tribal forces after recapturing Uri and Baramula, and sent a [[relief column]] southwards, in an attempt to relieve Poonch. Although the relief column eventually reached Poonch, the siege could not be lifted. A second relief column reached [[Kotli]], and evacuated the garrisons of that town and others but were forced to abandon it being too weak to defend it. Meanwhile, [[Mirpur, Azad Kashmir|Mirpur]] was captured by the tribal forces on 25 November 1947. Hindu women were reportedly abducted by tribal forces and taken into Pakistan. They were sold in the brothels of Rawalpindi. Around 400 women jumped into wells in Mirpur committing suicide to escape from being abducted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Colonel Tej K. |last=Tikoo |chapter=Genesis of Kashmir Problem and how it got Complicated: Events between 1931 and 1947 AD |title=Kashmir: Its Aborigines and their Exodus |publisher=Lancer Publishers |location=New Delhi, Atlanta |year=2013 |ISBN=1935501585}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indians held onto Jhanger against numerous counterattacks, who were increasingly supported by regular Pakistani Forces. In the Kashmir Valley the Indians attacked, recapturing Tithwail.

In the Jammu region, the forces besieged in Poonch broke out and temporarily linked up with the outside world again. The Kashmir State army was able to defend Skardu from the Gilgit Scouts impeding their advance down the Indus valley towards Leh. In August the [[Chitral Scouts]] and [[Chitral Bodyguard]] under Mata ul-Mulk besieged Skardu and with the help of artillery were able to take Skardu. This freed the Gilgit Scouts to push further into [[Ladakh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7sneAAAAMAAJ|title=In the Line of Duty: A Soldier Remembers|last=Singh|first=Harbakhsh|date=2000-01-01|publisher=Lancer Publishers &amp; Distributors|year=|isbn=9788170621065|location=|page=227|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqTjAAAAMAAJ|title=The battles of Zojila, 1948|last=Bloeria|first=Sudhir S.|date=1997-12-31|publisher=Har-Anand Publications|year=|isbn=|location=|page=72|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time the front began to settle down. The siege of Poonch continued. An unsuccessful attack was launched by [[77th Indian Infantry Brigade|77 Parachute Brigade]] (Brig Atal) to capture [[Zoji La]] pass. Operation Duck, the earlier epithet for this assault, was renamed as Operation Bison by [[Kodandera Madappa Cariappa|Cariappa]]. [[M3 Stuart|M5 Stuart light tanks]] of [[7th Light Cavalry|7 Cavalry]] were moved in dismantled conditions through Srinagar and winched across bridges while two field companies of the [[Madras Engineer Group|Madras Sappers]] converted the mule track across Zoji La into a jeep track. The surprise attack on 1 November by the brigade with armour supported by two regiments of [[Ordnance QF 25 pounder|25 pounders]] and a regiment of [[3.7 inch Mountain Howitzer|3.7-inch guns]], forced the pass and pushed the tribal and Pakistani forces back to [[Matayan]] and later [[Dras]].

The Indians now started to get the upper hand in all sectors. [[Poonch]] was finally relieved after a siege of over a year. The Gilgit forces in the High Himalayas, who had previously made good progress, were finally defeated. The Indians pursued as far as Kargil before being forced to halt due to supply problems.

He was instrumental in forming the Graduate Theological Union which he headed during its first decade, first as Dean from 1964-1969 and then, from 1967 to 1972, as its first president, a post to which he returned in 1999-2000. He also served as President of Hartford Seminary, Dean of the Faculty at [[San Francisco Theological Seminary]], Chair of the Program in History and Philosophy at [[Harvard University]], and as President of the [[American Academy of Religion]].

As a [[historian of science]], Dillenberger specialized in the [[religion and science|relations of religion and science]].  For three decades, his book ''Protestant Thought and Natural Science'' ([[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1960) was a leading introductory survey.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hedley Brooke]], Bibliographic Essay (pages 348-403) in ''Science and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives'', 1991, [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-23961-3}} 
:: &lt;blockquote&gt; There is a prolific literature having "the relations between science and religion" as its organizing theme. Much is suspect because of thinly veiled apologetic intentions; much is vitiated by an insensitivity to the richness of past debates that historical analysis alone can remedy. Among recent studies... Although colored by a distinctive Protestant [[neo-orthodoxy]], the historical interpretation in John Dillenberger, Protestant theology and natural science (London, 1961), has also retained much of its value.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As an introductory survey, this book has been superseded by [[Christopher B. Kaiser]]'s ''Creation and the History of Science'' ([[Eerdmans]], 1991).&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Religion in the English Speaking World, 1600-1727 A Biliographic Guide to the Secondary Literature'', Richard S. Brooks &amp; David K. Himrod, [[Scarecrow Press]], 2001, {{ISBN|0-8108-4011-1}}, pp.101-102, 241&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jvari inscriptions''' ({{lang-ka|ჯვრის წარწერები}}) are the [[Georgian language]] inscriptions written in the Georgian ''[[Asomtavruli]]'' script on the [[Jvari Monastery]], a [[basilica]] located near [[Mtskheta]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Georgian Soviet Encyclopedia]], V. 11, p. 563, Tbilisi, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Shoshiashvili, Corpus of Georgian Inscriptions, I, Tbilisi, Eastern and Southern Georgia, V-X centuries, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions mention Georgian princes [[Stephen I of Iberia]], [[Demetrius the Hypatos]] and [[Adarnase I of Iberia]]. However, Professor [[Cyril Toumanoff]] disagrees with this view and identifies these individuals with [[Stephen II of Iberia]], Demetrius and [[Adarnase II of Iberia]], respectively. Inscriptions are dated to the 6th-7th centuries.&lt;ref name="Rapp"&gt;Rapp, Stephen H. (2003), ''Studies In Medieval Georgian Historiography: Early Texts And Eurasian Contexts'', p. 344.

{{Japanese name|Asakawa}}
{{nihongo|'''Kan'ichi Asakawa'''|朝河 貫一|Asakawa Kan'ichi|December 20, 1873 – August 10, 1948}} was a Japanese academic, author, historian, librarian, curator and peace advocate. Asakawa was Japanese by birth and citizenship, but he lived the major portion of his life in the United States.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Nihonmatsu|Nihonmatsu, Japan]], and was educated at the [[Asaka High School|Fukushima-ken Jinjo School]] in [[Fukushima Prefecture]] and at [[Waseda University]] in [[Tokyo]] before he traveled to the [[United States]] to study at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]].  He was awarded his BA degree in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QXQ4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA57&amp;dq=kanichi+asakawa&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a  ''Dartmouth College Catalogue, 1898-1899,'' p. 57.]&lt;/ref&gt;  He continued his studies at [[Yale University]], earning his Ph.D. in 1902.&lt;ref name="yamato69"&gt;Yamato Ichihashi ''et al.'' (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=aLHqHXhoPvsC&amp;pg=RA1-PA484&amp;dq=kanichi+asakawa&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA69,M1  ''Morning Glory, Evening Shadow: Yamato Ichihashi and His Internment Writings, 1942-1945,'' p. 69.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He lectured at [[Dartmouth College]] in 1902; was a professor at [[Waseda University]] (1906–07); an instructor at [[Yale University]] (1907–10); and became an assistant professor at Yale University in 1910. He carried on special research in Japan in 1906-07 and 1917-19. He became a professor at Yale University in 1937, becoming the first Japanese professor at a major American university. He was the author of many works on Japan, his scholarly interest being medieval history. He taught history at Yale for 35 years.&lt;ref name="yamato69"/&gt;  Among those he influenced was [[John Whitney Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeffrey Mass|Mass, Jeffrey P.]] (1995). [https://books.google.com/books?id=42g6lMEVymAC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=kanichi+asakawa&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a  ''Antiquity and Anachronism in Japanese History,'' p. 15.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 1907, Asakawa was appointed curator of the East Asian Collection at Yale's [[Sterling Memorial Library]].&lt;ref name="yamato69"/&gt;

Asakawa helped found Asian studies in the United States.

==Political perspective==
After the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], Asakawa began to speak out against the growth of militarism in Japan. He dedicated himself to serving as a bridge between the United States and Japan to promote amicable relations. In 1941, he sought to avert war between Japan and the United States by trying to convince President Roosevelt to reach out to the Japanese emperor with a personal telegram.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Warren I. (1996). [https://books.google.com/books?id=xaIKc6REOcsC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=kanichi+asakawa&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a  ''Pacific Passage: the Study of American-East Asian Relations on the Eve of the Twenty-first Century,'' p. 42.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Every summer, Dartmouth students who are studying Japanese abroad in Japan take a trip to Asakawa's hometown of [[Nihonmatsu]], and pay homage by visiting both the high school where he studied, and his grave site. Some of his remains are interred at Kanairo Cemetery in Nihonmatsu, and others are interred in the [[Grove Street Cemetery]], [[New Haven, Connecticut]].

In 2007 the Asakawa garden in [[Saybrook College]], designed by [[Shinichiro Abe]],  was dedicated to mark the centennial of Asakawa's appointment as an instructor of history at Yale.

[[Image:Agassiz.jpg|thumb|400px|An early map of the extent of Lake Agassiz in central North America, by 19th century geologist [[Warren Upham]]. The regions covered by the lake were significantly larger than shown here.]]

'''Lake Agassiz''' was a very large [[glacial lake]] in central [[North America]]. Fed by glacial meltwater at the end of the [[last glacial period]], its area was larger than all of the modern [[Great Lakes]] combined&lt;ref name="Perkins"/&gt; though its mean depth was not as great as that of many major lakes today.

First postulated in 1823 by [[William H. Keating]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keating |first1=William H. |title=Narrative of an Expedition to the Source of St. Peter's River, Lake Winnepeek, Lake of the Woods, … |date=1824 |publisher=H.C.

==Geological progression==
During the last [[Ice Age]], northern North America was covered by a glacier, which alternately advanced and decayed with variations in the climate.  This continental ice sheet formed during the period now known as the [[Wisconsin glaciation]], and covered much of central North America between 30,000 and 10,000 years ago.  As the ice sheet disintegrated,&lt;ref&gt;The "retreat" of glacial margins is not caused by a reversal of the glacier's flow, but rather from melting of the ice sheet.&lt;/ref&gt; its meltwaters created an immense [[proglacial lake]].&lt;ref name=Ojakangas&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Ojakangas RW, Matsch CL |title=Minnesota's Geology|year=1982|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minnesota|isbn=0816609535|pages=106–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 13,000 years ago, this lake came to cover much of what are now [[Manitoba]], northwestern [[Ontario]], northern [[Minnesota]], eastern [[North Dakota]], and [[Saskatchewan]]. At its greatest extent, it may have covered as much as {{convert|440000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Fisher| first1 = Timothy G.| last2 = Smith| first2 = Derald G.| last3 = Andrews| first3 = John T.| title = Preboreal oscillation caused by a glacial Lake Agassiz flood| journal = Quaternary Science Reviews| volume = 21| issue = 2002| pages = 873–78| publisher = | location = | year = 2002| url = http://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/Faculty/fisher/Fisher/Publications_files/Fisher_etal_QSR02.pdf| jstor = | doi = 10.1016/S0277-3791(01)00148-2| accessdate = 2018-04-07| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140222170725/http://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/Faculty/fisher/Fisher/Publications_files/Fisher_etal_QSR02.pdf| archivedate = 22 February 2014| df = dmy-all| bibcode = 2002QSRv...21..873F}}, at page 874.

The ice returned to the south for a time, but as it again retreated north of the present [[Canada–United States border]] around 10,000 years ago, Lake Agassiz refilled. The last major shift in drainage occurred around 8,200 years ago. The melting of remaining [[Hudson Bay]] ice caused Lake Agassiz to drain nearly completely.

Lake Agassiz's major drainage reorganization events were of such magnitudes that they had significant impact on climate, sea level and possibly early [[human civilization]]. The lake's enormous freshwater release into the Arctic Ocean has been postulated to have disrupted oceanic circulation and cause temporary cooling. The draining of 13,000 years ago may be the cause of the [[Younger Dryas]] [[stadial]].&lt;ref name = Perkins/&gt;&lt;ref name=Broecker&gt;{{cite journal |last=Broecker |first=Wallace S. |date=2006-05-26 |title=Was the Younger Dryas Triggered by a Flood? |journal=Science |volume=312 |issue=5777 |pages=1146–1148 |doi=10.1126/science.1123253 |url=|pmid=16728622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Fisher| first1 = Timothy G.| last2 = Smith| first2 = Derald G.| last3 = Andrews| first3 = John T.| title = Preboreal oscillation caused by a glacial Lake Agassiz flood| journal = Quaternary Science Reviews| volume = 21| issue = 2002| pages = 873–78| publisher = | location = | year = 2002| url = http://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/Faculty/fisher/Fisher/Publications_files/Fisher_etal_QSR02.pdf| jstor = | doi = 10.1016/S0277-3791(01)00148-2| accessdate = 2012-09-28| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140222170725/http://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/Faculty/fisher/Fisher/Publications_files/Fisher_etal_QSR02.pdf| archivedate = 22 February 2014| df = dmy-all| bibcode = 2002QSRv...21..873F}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although disputed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polémique scientifique sur la disparition du lac Agassiz|url=http://www.journal.uqam.ca/archives/2007-2008/3417.pdf|author=Dominique Forget|website=Journal L'[[UQAM]]|pages=3-4 |date=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the draining at 9,900–10,000 years ago may be the cause of the [[8.2 kiloyear event|8,200 yr climate event]]. A recent study by Turney and Brown links the 8,500-years ago drainage to the expansion of agriculture from east to west across Europe; they suggest that this may also account for various [[flood myth]]s of prehistoric cultures, including the [[Genesis flood narrative|Biblical flood narrative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Turney CS, Brown H |year=2007|title=Catastrophic early Holocene sea level rise, human migration and the Neolithic transition in Europe|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=26|pages=2036–2041 |doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2007.07.003 |issue=17–18|bibcode=2007QSRv...26.2036T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phases==
In this section, YBP denotes years [[before present]].

===Lockhart Phase: 12,875–12,560 YBP===
[[File:13,000 YBP Lockhart Phase.jpg|thumb|Lockhart Phase of Lake Agassiz, ca 13,000 YBP. Teller and Leverington, 2004 (U.S. Geological Survey)]]During the Lockhart Phase, water accumulated in the Red River valley of [[North Dakota]] and [[Minnesota]]. As the water reached to the top of the divide to the south, the water drained into the ancestral [[Minnesota River|Minnesota]] and [[Mississippi River]] system. This occurred while the Laurentian Ice Sheet was at or below the current Canada–US border.&lt;ref name=Michalek&gt;Examining the progression and termination of Lake Agassiz: Michael J. Michalek; 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  As the ice sheet melted northward, an early Lake Agassiz covered southern [[Manitoba]], the Minnesota and [[Ontario]] boundary country, and along the Red River south of [[Fargo, North Dakota]].  The Lockhart phase is associated with the Herman lake stage ({{convert|335|m|ft}}), the highest shoreline of Lake Agassiz.  The [[Big Stone Moraine]] formed the southern boundary of the lake. During the Lockhart Phase the lake is estimated to have been {{convert|231|m|ft}} deep, with greater depths near the glacier.&lt;ref name=Michalek/&gt;

===Moorhead Phase: 12,560–11,690 YBP===
As the ice sheet melted northward, Lake Agassiz found a lower outlet through the [[Kaministiquia River|Kaministikwia]] route along the modern Minnesota–Ontario border.  This moved water to [[Lake Duluth]], a proglacial lake in the [[Lake Superior]] basin.  From there the water drained south via an ancestral [[St. Croix River (Wisconsin–Minnesota)|St. Croix]] and [[Mississippi River]] system. The lake drained below the Herman lake beaches until [[isostatic rebound]] and glacial advances closed the Kaministikwia route.  This stabilized the lake at the Norcross lake stage ({{convert|325|m|ft}}).&lt;ref name=Michalek/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Thorleifson, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The average depth of Lake Agassiz during the late Moorhead Phase was {{convert|258|m|ft}}. Drainage from Lake Agassiz continued to flow southward out of the ancient Minnesota and Mississippi River systems into the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name=Michalek/&gt;

===Emerson Phase: 11,690–10,630 YBP===
During the Emerson Phase, lake levels and drainage patterns continually fluctuated. The lake switched from a southward outlet to a northwestern outlet, and may have been static without a significant outlet during this phase.  Isostatic rebound changed the altitude of the land, and this, combined with changes in the volume of meltwater from the ice margin and the closure of the Kaministikwia outlet in the east increased the size of the northern end of the lake.&lt;ref name=Michalek/&gt;  One hypothesis postulates that the lake was a ‘terminal lake’  with water inflows and evapotranspiration being equal. Dating of the glacial moraines shows that the [[Clearwater River (Saskatchewan)|Clearwater]] and [[Athabasca River]] system and [[Lake Nipigon]] and Minong basin were still ice-covered. A period of precipitation and meltwater input balance with the rate of evapotranspiration may have existed for a short period of time.&lt;ref name=Michalek/&gt;  During this phase, the Clearwater and Athabasca River system outlet opened. Isostatic rebound opened the southern outlet for a time, creating the Norcross ({{convert|325|m|ft}}), Tintah ({{convert|310|m|ft}}), and Upper Campbell ({{convert|299|m|ft}}) beaches.  The south outlet was permanently closed at the end of Emerson Phase.&lt;ref name=Michalek/&gt;

===Nipigon Phase: 10,630–9,160 YBP===
The opening of the Kaministikwia outlet to the east initiated the onset of the Nipigon Phase. The lower lake level ended the southern outlet through the ancestral Minnesota and Mississippi River system.&lt;ref name=Michalek/&gt;  The ice sheets advanced and blocked the northwestern outlet through the Clearwater and Athabasca system. There were several other low level outlets into the [[Lake Minong]] basin, including the Kaministikwia and the Lake Nipigon outlet.  These allowed large amounts of water to flow from Lake Agassiz into Lake Minong.  A series of ice advances and retreats between 10,500 and to 9,500 YBP blocked the Lake Nipigon outlet and the other low level outlets, creating intermittent catastrophic outbursts of water into the Lake Minong basin.&lt;ref name=Michalek/&gt;

These large inflows of water raised Lake Minong lake levels and flowed into Lake Algonquin in the Lake Michigan/Huron basin.&lt;ref name=Michalek/&gt; These outbursts refilled the Lake Michigan and Huron basins, which are extreme low water levels of the [[Lake Chippewa]] (Lake Michigan basin) and [[Glacial Lake Stanley|Lake Stanley]] (Lake Huron basin). This was due to isostatic rebound of the northern shorelines combined with the opening of the [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]] outlet of the Lake Huron basin.&lt;ref name=Michalek/&gt; These repetitive outbursts from Lake Agassiz flooded the Lake Minong basin, then flowed over into the Lake Stanley basin, and then flowed through the North Bay drainage route into the [[Champlain Sea]] (present day [[St. Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]] lowland).&lt;ref name=Michalek/&gt; The shifting ice sheet created fluctuating drainage channels into the Lake Nipigon and Superior basin.  A dozen beaches were created during short periods of stability.  Towards the end of the Nipising Phase, Lake Agassiz reached its largest geographical size as it joined with [[Lake Ojibway]] in the east.&lt;ref name=Michalek/&gt;

===Ojibway Phase: 9,160–8,480 YBP===
[[File:7,900 Glacial Lake Agassiz &amp; Glacial Lake Ojibway (7900) use fileTeller and Leverington, 2004.jpg|thumb|Map of Glacial Lake Agassiz and Lake Ojibway ca 7900 YBP.  Designed from Teller and Leverington, 2004 (U.S. Geological Survey)]]The Ojibway Phase is named for the glacial lake along the ice front in northern [[Ontario]]. [[Lake Ojibway]] merged with Lake Agassiz at this time.  Isostatic rebound of glaciated lands that were south of the ice sheet created a long linear lake from the [[Saskatchewan]]–[[Manitoba]] border to [[Quebec]]. This long lake drained through the eastern outlet at [[Kinojevis River|Kinojevis]], into the [[Ottawa River]] valley.&lt;ref name=Michalek/&gt;  Lake Agassiz-Ojibway drainage raised the sea level. The results can be seen in [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]], and eastern [[Maine]]. Marine records from the North Atlantic have identified two separate episodes, linked to northern hemisphere cooling in 8,490 YBP and 8,340-8,180 YBP. These may be linked with the Ojibway Phase of Lake Agassiz and may indicate large amounts of drainage from the Ottawa River valley and the [[Tyrrell Sea]] (ancestral Hudson Bay).&lt;ref name=Michalek/&gt;

The Laurentide Ice Sheet continued to recede.  Continued warming shrank the ice front towards present day Hudson Bay.  Here, the Lake Agassiz northward outlet drained into the [[Tyrrell Sea]]. This breach dropped the water level below the eastern Kinojevis outlet. The drainage was followed by the disintegration of the adjacent ice front at about 8,480 YBP. This brought on the end of Lake Agassiz. The ice sheet continued its northward retreat to Baffin Island, leaving the mainland North America around 5,000 YBP.&lt;ref name=Michalek/&gt;

==Lakes of the Lake Agassiz basin==
Numerous lakes have formed in this glacial lake basin. The best known are the ''Great Lakes of Manitoba''; [[Lake Winnipeg]], [[Lake Manitoba]], and [[Lake Winnipegosis]]. A cluster of smaller lakes surround these, including: [[Cedar Lake (Manitoba)|Cedar Lake]], through which the [[Saskatchewan River|Saskatchewan]] flows; [[Lake Dauphin]], south of Lake Winnipegosis and tributary to it; and [[Lake St. Martin]], on the Fairford or [[Little Saskatchewan River]], the outlet of Lakes Manitoba and Winnipegosis.&lt;ref name=UphamII/&gt; In northern Minnesota, there are [[Roseau Lake (Manitoba)|Roseau]], [[Thief Lake (Manitoba)|Thief]], [[Mud Lake (Manitoba)|Mud]], and [[Maple Lake (Manitoba)|Maple lakes]], besides three large lakes of that state, [[Rainy Lake]], the [[Lake of the Woods]], and [[Red Lake (Minnesota)|Red Lake]].&lt;ref name=UphamII/&gt;

==Glacial Lakes draining into Lake Agassiz==
Glacial [[Lake Souris]] formed along the [[Manitoba]] and [[North Dakota]] border, forming a crescent around the west side of the [[Turtle Mountain (Alberta)|Turtle Mountains]].  Lake Souris had three successive outlets:  the Sheyenne River, the Pembina River, and finally the Assiniboine River.&lt;ref&gt;(Upham, 1895), pp. 267; 270–272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The land around former Lake Souris inclines downhill along a northeast direction; thus, as the ice sheet retreated northwards, it exposed outlets of successively lower elevation. (Upham, 1895), pp. 270–272.&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, Lake Souris' southern bay drained into the [[Sheyenne River]], a tributary of the Red River, which in turn flowed into Lake Agassiz.&lt;ref&gt;(Upham, 1895), p. 268.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after the ice sheet had retreated enough to uncover Turtle Mountain, the northern bay of Lake Souris found an outlet at the "elbow" of the modern [[Souris River]]; the elbow is about {{convert|18|mi|km}} southwest of the present mouth of the Souris River.&lt;ref name=UphamII/&gt;{{rp|57}} From this elbow, the lake's waters flowed southeast and entered the [[Pembina River (Manitoba – North Dakota)|Pembina River]], now a tributary of the [[Red River of the North|Red River]],&lt;ref name=UphamII/&gt;{{rp|57–58,268}} and the Pembina, in turn, entered Lake Agassiz at its [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]] embayment.&lt;ref&gt;(Upham, 1895), Plate IX (following p. 36).&lt;/ref&gt;  When the ice sheet retreated north of the Assiniboine River, Lake Souris drained via that river into Lake Agassiz.&lt;ref&gt;(Upham, 1895), pp. 271–272; see also Plate XXI (following p. 268).&lt;/ref&gt;  ([[Pelican Lake (Manitoba)|Pelican Lake]] in Langs Valley of Manitoba occupies what was once the northern shore of Lake Souris.&lt;ref&gt;(Upham, 1895), see Plate XXI (following p. 268).&lt;/ref&gt;)

The lower part of the [[Saskatchewan River]] basin near the river's mouth at Cedar Lake was clear of the ice-sheet before Lake Agassiz began to drain to northeast.&lt;ref name=UphamII/&gt;  Lake Saskatchewan existed on about {{convert|135|mi|km}} of the [[North Saskatchewan River]] between [[Saskatoon]] and [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]], [[Saskatchewan]].  A few miles east of Lake Saskatchewan’s outlet, near the modern junction of the north and south branches, it entered Lake Agassiz.  This Saskatchewan embayment extended for {{convert|400|mi|km}} along the modern Saskatchewan River, route.&lt;ref name=UphamII/&gt;

==Formation of beaches==
[[Raised beach]]es, many kilometers from any water, mark the former boundaries of the lake. While the Red River gradually descends from south to north, these old [[High water mark|strandlines]] ascend as one goes north, due to [[isostatic rebound]] since glaciation.&lt;ref name=Ojakangas/&gt; 

===When Lake Agassiz out flowed to the south===
The highest shore of Lake Agassiz is called the [[Herman Beach]]. It is named for [[Herman, Minnesota]], in [[Grant County, Minnesota|Grant County]].  The Herman Beach is the highest shoreline and can be traced from the historic outlet at [[Traverse Gap|Lake Traverse]] on the border of Minnesota and South Dakota.  The beach fluctuates between {{convert|973|ft|m}} and {{convert|976|ft|m}} above sea level. The altitude of Lake Traverse at {{convert|971|ft|m}} above sea level at the [[Traverse Gap]] at [[Browns Valley, Minnesota|Brown’s Valley]] is at {{convert|980|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=UphamVII/&gt;  This was the south outlet of Lake Agassiz.&lt;ref name=UphamVI&gt;The Glacial Lake Agassiz;, Monographs of the United States Geological Survey, Volume XXV; Warren Upham; Government Printing Office, Washington; 1895; Chapter VI&lt;/ref&gt;

The Herman Beach displays numerous deltas from the major rivers that entered Lake Agassiz.  In Minnesota and North Dakota, these include the Buffalo River Delta, Sand Hill River Delta, Sheyenne River Delta, Elk Valley Delta, and the Pembina River Delta.  In Manitoba, there is the Assiniboine River Delta.&lt;ref name=UphamVI/&gt;&lt;!-- is this to be part of the following list? --&gt;
* '''Beaches of the Norcross''' stages:  The Norcross shoreline lies near the Herman shore on the slope of eroded till.&lt;ref name=UphamVII&gt;The Glacial Lake Agassiz;, Monographs of the United States Geological Survey, Volume XXV; Warren Upham; Government Printing Office, Washington; 1895; Chapter VII&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Beaches of the Tintah''' stage: The Tintah beaches are {{convert|1040|ft|m}} to {{convert|1055|ft|m}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=UphamVII/&gt;
* '''Beaches of the Campbell''' stage: These have a well developed profile and are useful in establishing the boundary the lake when it ceased to flow south into the River Warren.&lt;ref name=UphamVII/&gt;
*  '''Beaches of the McCauleyville''' stage: The channel of the River Warren, flowing out of Lake Agassiz, eroded the channel below the level of Lakes Traverse and [[Big Stone Lake]], down to {{convert|935|ft|m}}, the deepest part of Lake Traverse. The southern portions of the McCauleyville shoreline coincides with the levels of high and low water in Lake Traverse, which are approximately {{convert|976|ft|m}} to {{convert|970|ft|m}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=UphamVII/&gt;

===When Lake Agassiz out flowed to the northeast===
Fourteen shorelines of Lake Agassiz have been identified, which lie below the McCauleyville beaches.  These formed when the River Warren could no longer receive the outflow of the lake. This occurred when a lower outlet was found and the lake shrank with the release of the lakes waters.&lt;ref name=UphamVIII&gt;The Glacial Lake Agassiz;, Monographs of the United States Geological Survey, Volume XXV; Warren Upham; Government Printing Office, Washington; 1895; Chapter VIII&lt;/ref&gt; The three highest shorelines are named the Blanchard beaches, and the next five in descending order the Hillsboro, the two Emerado, and the two Ojata beaches, from towns on or near their course in North Dakota.&lt;ref name=UphamVIII/&gt;

* '''Beaches of the Blanchard''' Stage (Hillsboro Beach): Three successive levels of the lake pass near [[Blanchard, North Dakota]].  They are indicated by sand and gravel deposits {{convert|5|mi|km}} to {{convert|7|mi|km}} southeast of [[Euclid, Minnesota]]., and near [[Midway station, Manitoba]]&lt;ref name=UphamVIII/&gt;  The next lower beach is called the Hillsboro beach and is visible near [[Glyndon, Minnesota]] and {{convert|5|mi|km}} to {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of [[Crookston, Minnesota]].&lt;ref name=UphamVIII/&gt;
* '''Beaches of the Emerado''' Stage: The Emerado shoreline, is approximately {{convert|885|ft|m}} above sea level.  Its southern tip is across the Red River between [[Kragnes, Minnesota]]., and [[Harwood, North Dakota]]. This single shoreline, clearly shows that it belongs to a period when the lake flowed northeastward to its outlet. Crustal rebound was greater to the north, where the Emerado beach, in Manitoba is {{convert|10|ft|m}} to {{convert|20|ft|m}} different.&lt;ref name=UphamVIII/&gt;
* '''Beaches of the Ojata''' stage:  The upper Ojata shoreline is between {{convert|870|ft|m}} to {{convert|875|ft|m}} above sea level near [[Perley, Minnesota]], and [[Noble, North Dakota]]. In Minnesota it is {{convert|2|mi|km}} to {{convert|6|mi|km}} east of the Red River.  Some of the shore is marked by a beach ridge, especially to the north, where the surface is till.&lt;ref name=UphamVIII/&gt;
* '''Gladstone beach''': The southern tip of Lake Agassiz when the Gladstone beach formed is near [[Belmont, North Dakota]], {{convert|20|m|km}} south of [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks]] it lies {{convert|845|ft|m}} above sea level.  It runs northward about {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of the Red River.&lt;ref name=UphamVIII/&gt;
* '''Burnside beach''':  The Burnside beach crosses the Red River at [[Grand Forks, North Dakota]] and to the northeast, then north, paralleling the Red River  {{convert|10|m|km}} to {{convert|13|m|km}} to the east. This beach is indistinct south of the International border. The beach lies {{convert|835|ft|m}} to {{convert|840|ft|m}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=UphamVIII/&gt;
* '''Ossowa beach''': The Osswas beach lies only a few miles south of the International boundary.  The beach lies {{convert|815|ft|m}} to {{convert|820|ft|m}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=UphamVIII/&gt;
* '''Stonewall beach''' In [[Stonewall, Manitoba]], there is a conspicuous beach ridge {{convert|0.33|mi|km}} or more. Its crest is {{convert|820|ft|m}} to {{convert|825|ft|m}} above sea level and about {{convert|10|ft|m}} deep. Beach deposits belonging to this stage were not observed elsewhere in southern Manitoba.  It is believed that they are buried for most of its length from the U.S. side of the border, north to [[Winnipeg]]&lt;ref name=UphamVIII/&gt;
* '''Beaches of the Niverville''' stage: About {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} southeast of [[Niverville, Manitoba|Niverville]] the road crosses this beach. Its crest is {{convert|777|ft|m}} to {{convert|778|ft|m}} above sea level.  It stands {{convert|4|ft|m}} above the surrounding surface. Beginning near Niverville station, it extends southeasterly at least a mile. About a {{convert|0.33|mi|km}} south a similar beach ridge crest at {{convert|780|ft|m}}.  It rises {{convert|2|ft|m}} to {{convert|4|ft|m}} above the land.  Much of it [[Slough (hydrology)|sloughs]], with water throughout the year, the elevation of the beach crest is {{convert|782|ft|m}} to {{convert|784|ft|m}} above sea level.&lt;ref name=UphamVIII/&gt;

==Soils==
The fertile soils of the [[Red River Valley]], now drained by the [[Red River of the North]], were formed from [[Lacustrine plain|lacustrine]] deposits of [[silt]] from Lake Agassiz.&lt;ref name=Ojakangas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Sansome| first = Constance Jefferson | title = Minnesota Underfoot: A Field Guide to the State's Outstanding Geologic Features | publisher = Voyageur Press| year = 1983| location = Stillwater, MN | isbn = 0-89658-036-9|pages=174–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buddhist games list''' is a list of [[game]]s that [[Gautama Buddha]] is reputed to have said  that he would not play and that his disciples should likewise not play, because he believed them to be a 'cause for negligence'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/bodhi Brahmajala Sutta, [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]], trans.]&lt;/ref&gt;  This list dates from the 6th or 5th [[century]] BCE and is the earliest known list of games.&lt;ref name="hist_chess"/&gt;

There is some [[debate]] about the [[translation]] of some of the games mentioned, and the list given here is based on the translation by [[T. W.  Rhys Davids]] of the ''[[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajāla Sutta]]'' and is in the same order given in the original.&lt;ref name="rhysdavids"&gt;{{cite book | title=Dialogues of the Buddha | publisher=Pali Text Society | author=Davids, T. W. Rhys | year=1899–1921|volume=|url=}}{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list is duplicated in a number of other early Buddhist texts, including the ''[[Vinaya Pitaka]]''.&lt;ref name="hist_chess"&gt; [https://books.google.com/books?id=VBYLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=brahmajala+sutta+games&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GvLW2Y1vz-&amp;sig=l2Hmuxpz1NqwKR18f78SbVDKzSQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_z77__5XbAhUlwlkKHXGfB4U4ChDoAQhBMAY#v=onepage&amp;q=brahmajala%20sutta%20games&amp;f=false ''A History of Chess'', by Harold James Ruthven Murray]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Vibhanga&gt;[https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss13/en/brahmali Bhikkhu Vibangha, Kuladūsaka]&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Board game|Games on boards]] with 8 or 10 rows. This is thought to refer to ''[[ashtapada]]'' and ''[[dasapada]]'' respectively, but later [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] commentaries refer to these boards also being used with games involving dice.&lt;ref name="hist_chess"/&gt;
# The same games played on imaginary boards. ''Akasam astapadam'' was an ''ashtapada'' variant played with no board, literally "astapadam played in the sky". A correspondent in the [[American Chess Bulletin]] identifies this as likely the earliest literary mention of a [[blindfold chess]] variant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CqJJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA104&amp;lpg=RA2-PA104&amp;dq=brahmajala+sutta+games&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h-sAAAHX3V&amp;sig=PuoPxTP7jgKjowEsOlVHEJJrgsc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_z77__5XbAhUlwlkKHXGfB4U4ChDoAQhRMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=brahmajala%20sutta%20games&amp;f=false American Chess Bulletin, vol. 13-15, Hartwig Cassell &amp; Hermann Helms, eds.]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Games of marking diagrams on the floor such that the player can only walk on certain places. This is described in the ''Vinaya Pitaka'' as "having drawn a circle with various lines on the ground, there they play avoiding the line to be avoided". Rhys Davids suggests that it may refer to ''parihāra-patham'', a form of [[hop-scotch]].
# Games where players either remove pieces from a pile or add pieces to it, with the loser being the one who causes the heap to shake (similar to the modern game [[pick-up sticks]]).
# Games of throwing [[dice]].
# "Dipping the hand with the fingers stretched out in [[lac]], or red dye, or flour-water, and striking the wet hand on the ground or on a wall, calling out 'What shall it be?' and showing the form required--elephants, horses, &amp;c."
# [[Ball game]]s.
# Blowing through a ''pat-kulal'', a toy pipe made of leaves.
# Ploughing with a toy [[plough]].
# Playing with toy [[windmill]]s made from [[palm leaves]].
# Playing with toy measures made from palm leaves.
# Playing with toy carts.
# Playing with toy [[Bow (weapon)|bows]].
# Guessing at letters traced with the finger in the air or on a friend's back.
# Guessing a friend's thoughts.
# Imitating deformities.

Although the modern game of [[chess]] had not been invented at the time the list was made, earlier chess-like games such as ''[[chaturaji]]'' may have existed. [[H.J.R. Murray]] refers to Rhys Davids' 1899 translation, noting that the 8×8 board game is most likely ''[[ashtapada]]'' while the 10×10 game is ''[[dasapada]]''. He states that both are [[race game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=History of Board Games Other Than Chess | author=Murray, H J R|authorlink=H. J. R. Murray | page=35|year=1952|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2UNAQAAMAAJ|publisher=Clarendon Press}}{{full citation needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrences in the Pali Canon ==
The complete list is repeated several times in the [[Digha Nikaya]] as part of a passage called 'The Intermediate Section on Moral Discipline' that details ways in which the Buddha and his followers differ in their practices from [[brahmins]] and other ascetics.

The full list also occurs twice in the [[Vinaya Pitaka]], once in the [[Suttavibhanga]] as part of the criteria for a rule entailing suspension, and once in the [[Khandhaka|Cullavaga]] as part of a technical discussion regarding the procedure for banishing monks from an area.&lt;ref name=Vibhanga/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd11/en/horner-brahmali Kammakkhandhaka]&lt;/ref&gt;

An abbreviated version also occurs in at least two other sutras: the [[Upāli Sutta]] in the [[Anguttara Nikaya]] and the [[Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhaya Sutta]] in the [[Majjhima Nikaya]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://suttacentral.net/an10.99/en/sujato Upāli Sutta]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://suttacentral.net/mn38/en/bodhi Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhaya Sutta]&lt;/ref&gt;

The categorization of the past into discrete, quantified named blocks of time is called [[periodization]].&lt;ref name="Rabinowtz"&gt;Adam Rabinowitz. ''[https://www.academia.edu/6647852/Temporal_Divides_A_Critical_Review_of_the_Major_Schemes_of_Periodization_in_Indian_History It’s about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data]''. Study of the Ancient World Papers, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a list of such '''named time periods''' as defined in various fields of study. Major categorization systems include '''[[Chronology of the universe|cosmological]]''' (time periods in the [[Big bang|origin]] and mass evolution of the universe), '''[[Geological time scale|geological]]''' (time periods in the [[history of Earth|origin and evolution]] of the Earth), '''[[Biological anthropology|anthropological]]''' (time periods in the origin and [[human evolution|evolution]] of humans) and '''[[History|historical]]''' (written history).

== Human Time Periods ==
{{main|History by period}}

These can be divided broadly into prehistorical (before history began to be recorded) and historical periods (when written records began to be kept).
{{further|List of archaeological periods}}

In [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]], [[prehistory]] is subdivided around the [[three-age system]]. This list includes the use of the three-age system as well as a number of various designation used in reference to sub-ages within the traditional three.

The dates for each age can vary by region. On the [[geologic time scale]], the [[Holocene]] epoch starts at the end of the [[last glacial period|last glacial period of the current ice age]] (c.10,000 BC) and continues to the present. The beginning of Mesolithic is usually considered to correspond to the beginning of the [[Holocene]] epoch.

=== General Periods ===
{{Further|Universal history}}
* '''[[Prehistory|Pre-History]]''' –  Period between the appearance of ''[[Homo]]'' ("humans"; [[Oldowan|first stone tools]] &lt;abbr&gt;c.&lt;/abbr&gt; three million years ago) and the invention of writing systems (for the [[Ancient Near East]]: &lt;abbr&gt;c.&lt;/abbr&gt; five thousand years ago).
** '''[[Stone Age]]''' 
*** [[Paleolithic]] – is the earliest period of the Stone Age 
****[[Lower Paleolithic]] &amp;mdash; time of [[archaic human]] species, predates ''[[Homo sapiens]]''
****[[Middle Paleolithic]] &amp;mdash; coexistence of archaic and [[anatomically modern human]] species
****[[Upper Paleolithic]] &amp;mdash; [[Early human migrations|worldwide expansion]] of anatomically modern humans, disappearance of archaic humans by extinction or [[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|admixture]] with modern humans; earliest [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic|evidence for pictorial art]].
*** [[Mesolithic]] ([[Epipaleolithic]]) – was a period in the development of human technology between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic periods.
*** [[Neolithic]] – a period of primitive [[technological]] and [[social]] development, beginning about 10,200 BC in parts of the Middle East, and later in other parts of the world.
*** [[Chalcolithic]] (or "Eneolithic", "Copper Age") – this period was still largely Neolithic in character, where early [[copper]] metallurgy appeared alongside the use of stone tools.
** '''[[Bronze Age]]''' – is not part of prehistory for all regions and civilizations who had adopted or developed a writing system.
** '''[[Iron Age]]''' – is not part of prehistory for all civilizations who had introduced written records during the Bronze Age. 
*'''[[Protohistory]]''' – Period between prehistory and history, during which a culture or civilization has not yet developed writing but other cultures have already noted its existence in their own writings; the absolute time scale of "protohistory" varies widely depending on the region, from the late 4th millennium BCE in the Ancient Near East to the present in the case of [[uncontacted peoples]].
* '''[[Ancient history|Ancient History]]''' – Aggregate of past events from the beginning of recorded human history and extending as far as the Early Middle Ages or the Postclassical Era. The span of [[recorded history]] is roughly less than five thousand years, beginning with the earliest linguistic records in the third millennium BC in [[Sumer|Mesopotamia]] and [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Egypt]].
**'''[[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]]''' –  Broad term for a long period of cultural history centered on the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the interlocking civilizations of [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], collectively known as the [[Greco-Roman world]]. It is the period in which Greek and Roman society flourished and wielded great influence throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.
* '''[[Post-classical history|Post-Classical History]]''' – Period of time that immediately followed ancient history.  Depending on the continent, the era generally falls between the years CE 200–600 and CE 1200–1500. The major classical civilizations the era follows are [[Han dynasty|Han China]] (ending in 220), the [[Western Roman Empire]] (in 476), the [[Gupta Empire]] (in the 550s), and the [[Sasanian Empire]] (in 651). 
** '''[[Middle Ages]]''' (also called [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]) – Lasted from the 5th to the 14th century. It began with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 and is variously demarcated by historians as ending with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, merging into the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Discovery]].
*** [[Early Middle Ages]]
*** [[High Middle Ages]]
*** [[Late Middle Ages]]
* '''[[Modern history|Modern History]]''' – After the post-classical era
**'''[[Early modern period|Early Modern Period]]''' – The chronological limits of this period are open to debate. It emerges from the [[Late Middle Ages]] (c. 1500), demarcated by historians as beginning with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, in forms such as the [[Italian Renaissance]] in the West, the [[Ming Dynasty]] in the East, and the rise of the [[Aztec]] in the New World. The period ends with the beginning of the [[Age of Revolutions]].
** [[Modern history#Late modern period 2|'''Late Modern Period''']] – Began approximately in the mid-18th century; notable historical milestones included the [[French Revolution]], the [[American Revolution]], the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the [[Great Divergence]].
***[[Machine Age]] (1880–1945)
****[[Age of Oil]] (1901–present)
**** [[World War I]] (1914–1918)
**** [[Interwar period|Interwar Period]] (1918–1939)
***** [[Roaring Twenties]] (1920–1929)
***** [[Great Depression]] (1929–1939)
**** [[World War II]] (1939–1945)
** '''[[Contemporary history|Contemporary History]]''' – History within living memory. It shifts forward with the generations, and today is the span of historic events from approximately 1945 that are immediately relevant to the present time. For example, the [[Post-Modern]] movement (Soviet Union and United States, 1973–present)

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primitive Communism===
'''The First Stage:''' is usually called [[primitive communism]]. It has the following characteristics.
* '''Shared Property:''' there is no concept of ownership beyond individual possessions. All is shared by the tribe to ensure its survival.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* '''[[Hunter-gatherer|Hunter / Gatherer]]:''' tribal societies have yet to develop large scale agriculture and so their survival is a daily struggle.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* '''Proto-Democracy:''' there is usually no concept of "leadership" yet. So tribes are led by the best warrior if there is war, the best diplomat if they have steady contact with other tribes and so forth.

===Slave Society===
'''The Second Stage:''' may be called [[Slavery|slave society]], considered to be the beginning of "class society" where private property appears. 
* '''[[Social class|Class]]:''' here the idea of class appears. There is always a slave-owning [[ruling class]] and the slaves themselves.
* '''[[Statism]]:''' the state develops during this stage as a tool for the slave-owners to use and control the slaves.
* '''[[Agriculture]]:''' people learn to cultivate plants and animals on a large enough scale to support large populations.
* '''[[Democracy]] &amp;''' '''[[Authoritarianism]]:''' these opposites develop at the same stage. Democracy arises first with the development of the republican city-state, followed by the totalitarian empire.
* '''[[Property|Private Property]]:''' citizens now own more than personal property. Land ownership is especially important during a time of agricultural development.

=== Feudalism ===
'''The Third Stage:''' may be called [[feudalism]]; it appears after slave society collapses. This was most obvious during the European [[Middle Ages]] when society went from slavery to feudalism.
* '''[[Aristocracy]]:''' the state is ruled by monarchs who inherit their positions, or at times marry or conquer their ways into leadership.
* '''[[Theocracy]]:''' this is a time of largely religious rule. When there is only one religion in the land and its organizations affect all parts of daily life.
* '''[[Hereditary title|Hereditary Classes]]:''' [[caste]]s can sometimes form and one's class is determined at birth with no form of advancement. This was the case with [[India]].
* '''[[Nation-state]]:''' nations are formed from the remnants of the fallen empires. Sometimes, they rebuild themselves into empires once more; this was the case with England's transition from a [[Roman province|province]] to an [[British Empire|empire]].

===Capitalism===
[[Capitalism]] may be considered '''The Fourth Stage''' in the sequence. Marx pays special attention to this stage in human development. The bulk of his work is devoted to analysing the mechanisms of capitalism, which in western society classically arose "red in tooth and claw" from feudal society in a revolutionary movement. In capitalism, the [[profit motive]] rules and people, freed from serfdom, work for the capitalists for wages. The capitalist class are free to spread their laissez faire practices around the world. In the capitalist-controlled parliament, laws are made to protect wealth.

Capitalism appears after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists (or their merchant predecessors) overthrow the feudal system, and it is categorized by the following:
* '''[[Market economy|Market Economy]]:''' In capitalism, the entire economy is guided by market forces. Supporters of [[laissez-faire]] economics argue that there should be little or no intervention from the government under capitalism. Marxists, however, such as Lenin in his ''Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism'', argue that the capitalist government is a powerful instrument for the furtherance of capitalism and the capitalist nation-state, particularly in the conquest of markets abroad.
* '''[[Private property|Private Property]]:''' The [[means of production]] are no longer in the hands of the monarchy and its nobles, but rather they are controlled by the capitalists. The capitalists control the means of production through commercial enterprises (such as [[corporation]]s) which aim t/o maximise profit.
* '''[[Parliamentary democracy|Parliamentary Democracy]]:''' The capitalists tend to govern through an elected centralised parliament or congress, rather than under an autocracy. Capitalist (bourgeois) democracy, although it may be extended to the whole population, does not necessarily lead to [[universal suffrage]]. Historically it has excluded (by force, segregation, legislation or other means) sections of the population such as women, slaves, ex-slaves, people of colour or those on low income. The government acts on behalf of, and is controlled by, the capitalists through various methods.
* '''[[Wages]]:''' In capitalism, workers are rewarded according to their contract with their employer. Power elites propagate the illusion that market forces mean wages converge to an equilibrium at which workers are paid for precisely the value of their services.  In reality workers are paid less than the value of their productivity — the difference forming profit for the employer.  In this sense all paid employment is exploitation and the worker is "alienated" from their work.  Insofar as the profit-motive drives the market, it is impossible for workers to be paid for the full value of their labour, as all employers will act in the same manner.
* '''[[Imperialism]]:''' Wealthy countries seek to dominate poorer countries in order to gain access to raw materials and to provide captive markets for finished products. This is done directly through war, the threat of war, or the export of capital. The capitalist's control over the state can play an essential part in the development of capitalism, to the extent the state directs warfare and other foreign intervention.
* '''[[Financial institution|Financial Institution]]s:''' [[Bank]]s and capital markets such as [[stock exchange]]s direct unused capital to where it is needed.  They reduce barriers to entry in all markets, especially to the poor; it is in this way that banks dramatically improve class mobility.
* '''[[Monopoly|Monopolistic Tendencies]]:''' The natural, unrestrained market forces will create monopolies from the most successful commercial entities.

But according to Marx, capitalism, like slave society and feudalism, also has critical failings — inner contradictions which will lead to its downfall. The working class, to which the capitalist class gave birth in order to produce commodities and profits, is the "grave digger" of capitalism. The worker is not paid the full value of what he or she produces. The rest is surplus value — the capitalist's profit, which Marx calls the "unpaid labour of the working class."  The capitalists are forced by competition to attempt to drive down the wages of the working class to increase their profits, and this creates conflict between the classes, and gives rise to the development of class consciousness in the working class. The working class, through trade union and other struggles, becomes conscious of itself as an exploited class. In the view of classical Marxism, the struggles of the working class against the attacks of the capitalist class will eventually lead the working class to establish its own collective control over production

===Socialism===
After the working class gains class consciousness and mounts a revolution against the capitalists, [[socialism (Marxism)|socialism]], which may be considered '''The Fifth Stage''', will be attained, if the workers are successful. [[Marxism|Marxist Socialism]] may be characterised as follows:
* '''[[Commons|Common Property]]:''' the [[means of production]] are taken from the hands of a few capitalists and put in the hands of the workers. This translates into the democratic communes controlling the means of production.
* '''[[Council democracy|Council Democracy]]:''' Marx, basing himself on a thorough study of [[The Civil War in France|Paris Commune]], believed that the workers would govern themselves through system of communes. He called this the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], which, overthrowing the dictatorship (governance) of capital, would democratically plan production and the resources of the planet.

Marx explained that, since socialism, the first stage of communism, would be "in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges", each worker would naturally expect to be awarded according to the amount of labor he contributes, despite the fact that each worker's ability and family circumstances would differ, so that the results would still be unequal at this stage, although fully supported by social provision.

== Geologic Time Periods ==
{{main|Geologic time scale|List of Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points}}
The [[geologic time scale]] covers the extent of the existence of Earth, from about 4600 million years ago to the present day. It is marked by [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points]]. Geologic time units are (in order of descending specificity) eons, eras, periods, epochs, and ages; and the corresponding [[Chronostratigraphy|chronostratigraphic]] units, which measure "rock-time", are eonothems, erathems, systems, series, and stages.

The second and third timelines are each subsections of their preceding timeline as indicated by asterisks. The Cenozoic is sometimes divided into the [[Quaternary]] and [[Tertiary]] periods, although the latter is no longer used officially.

'''Maryannu''' is an ancient word for the caste of [[chariot]]-mounted hereditary warrior nobility which existed in many of the societies of the [[Middle East]] during the [[Bronze Age]].

The term is attested in the [[Amarna letters]] written by [[Haapi]]. [[Robert Drews]] writes that the name 'maryannu' although plural takes the singular 'marya', which in [[Sanskrit]] means "young warrior", and attaches a [[Hurrian]] suffix. (Drews:p.&amp;nbsp;59)[https://books.google.com/books?id=fcVIcaJxgdUC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;vq=maryannu&amp;dq=new+light+on+the+maryannu+as+chariot-warriors&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_search_s&amp;sig=ACfU3U0DRvQBDUE0BwsKAzkQ7MPcz-ipfA] He suggests that at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age most would have spoken either Hurrian or [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] but by the end of the 14th century most of the Levant maryannu had [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] names.

The resulting [[leap year]] was either 377 or 378 days long. It theoretically occurred every two (or occasionally three) years, but was sometimes avoided or employed by the [[college of Pontiffs|Roman pontiffs]] for political reasons regardless of the state of the solar year. Mercedonius was eliminated by Julius Caesar when he introduced the [[Julian calendar]] in 46 BC.

==History==
This month, instituted according to Roman tradition by [[Numa Pompilius]],&lt;ref&gt;Henry G Liddell, 1909, ''A History of Rome'', John Murray, London, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; was supposed to be inserted every two or three years to align the conventional 355-day Roman year with the [[tropical year|solar year]].&lt;ref&gt;"The lunar year of 354 days fell short of the solar year by 11{{fraction|1|4}} days: in 8 years this amounted to 90 days or three months. These 90 days he divided into two months of 22 and two months of 23 days, and introduced them alternately every second year for two octennial periods: every third octennial period, however, Numa intercalated only [...] three months [...] because he adopted 355 days as the length of his lunar year".  Daniel Spillan, [[Livy]]'s ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19725/19725-0.txt History of Rome]'', Book I. 19. Footnote 24.  This is the theory of [[Macrobius]] in ''Saturnalia'' (c. AD 430).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The decision of whether to insert the intercalary month was made by the [[pontifex maximus]], supposedly based on observations to ensure the best possible correspondence with the [[season]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Their management was left to the pontiffs—''ad metam eandem solis unde orsi essent—dies congruerent''; 'that the days might correspond to the same starting-point of the sun in the heavens whence they had set out.'"&lt;br&gt; D. Spillan, Livy's ''History of Rome'', Book I. 19. Footnote 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately the pontifex maximus, who would normally be an active politician, often manipulated the decision to allow friends to stay in office longer or force enemies out early.  Such unpredictable intercalation meant that dates following the month of Februarius could not be known in advance, and further to this, Roman citizens living outside Rome would often not know the current date.

The exact mechanism is not clearly specified in ancient sources.  Some scholars, such as Ludwig Ideler,&lt;ref&gt;C Ludwig Ideler, ''Handbuch der mathematischen und technische Chronologie'', Berlin 1825.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Liddell|Henry G Liddell]],&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, 1909, ''A History of Rome'', John Murray, London, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; the staff writers of ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' and Elias Bickerman&lt;ref&gt;E J Bickerman, ''Chronology of the Ancient World'', Ithaca, New York 1980, {{ISBN|0-80-141282-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  hold that in intercalary years February's length was fixed at 23 days and it was followed by a variable length ''mensis intercalaris'' with 27 or 28 days.   This view is followed in generalist surveys of calendrical history such as those of D E Duncan, G R Richards or A Aveni.

However, following a discussion of intercalation in A. K. Michels, ''The Calendar of the Roman Republic'' (Princeton, 1967) 145–172, the standard reference on the pre-Julian calendar, some specialist studies of the pre-Julian calendar published since 1967 &lt;ref&gt;including papers and books by  A. E. Samuel, P. S. Derow, P. Brind'Amour, V. M. Warrior, J. Rüpke, R. Hannah, and C. J. Bennett&lt;/ref&gt; claim that in intercalary years Februarius was set at either 23 or 24 days, and followed by an intercalary month of 27 days.&lt;ref&gt;The view is opposed by H. Chantraine, whose opinion is in turn dismissed by Brind'Amour as special pleading&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some of these writers assume that the various extracts from the Roman jurist Celsus (''Digest'' volume 39) quoted in the Significations [Definitions] of Justinian's Law Code (''The Enactments of Justinian, The Digest or Pandects'', tr. S P Scott, Cincinnati 1932 available at [http://droitromain.upmf-grenoble.fr/Anglica/D50_Scott.htm#XVI]) develop an argument.   This is not the case in Book 50, which is a series of unrelated dictionary definitions.&lt;/ref&gt;   Whichever interpretation is correct, the days ''a.d. VI Kal. Mart.'' to ''Prid. Kal. Mart.'', normally referring to the end of February, were in intercalary years the concluding days of the ''mensis intercalaris''.

The month was eliminated by Julius Caesar when he introduced the [[Julian calendar]] in 46 BC.

'''Modern reenactment''' is [[historical reenactment]] of events of the [[modern period]], most commonly events from the 18th century to the present.

The period starts with events such as the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the peak of the [[Royal Navy]]'s power.

The [[Victorian era]] is included, although not as well covered in terms of events as the major battles before and after it, with the notable exception of the [[American Civil War reenactment|American Civil War]], which has a large and active community of reenactors.

Depictions of 20th century events such as [[World War II reenactment|World War II]], the [[Korean War reenactment|Korean War]], and the [[Vietnam War]] are more firmly classified as ''modern reenactment''.

The period includes the development of firearms, from musket and cannon to automatic weapons, and vehicles ([[jeep]]s and army trucks are popular).

{{about|the concept in Gnosticism|the deities in Egyptian mythology|Ogdoad (Egyptian)}}
The concept of an '''Ogdoad''' appears in [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] systems of the early Christian era, and was further developed by the theologian [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] (''ca''. 160 AD).

The number eight plays an important part in Gnostic systems, and it is necessary to distinguish the different forms in which it appeared at different stages in the development of Gnosticism. The earliest Gnostic systems included a theory of [[seven heavens]] and a supercelestial region called the Ogdoad. Astronomical theories had introduced the concept of seven [[Celestial spheres|planetary spheres]] with an eighth above them, the sphere of the fixed stars.

In the [[Valentinianism|system of Valentinus]], the seven heavens, and even the region above them, were regarded as but the lowest and last stage of the exercise of creative power. Above them was the [[Pleroma]], where were exhibited the first manifestations of the evolution of subordinate existence from the great First Principle.

== 7 + 1 System ==

=== Seven heavens ===
[[Image:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|300px|right|thumb|Geocentric [[celestial spheres]]; Peter Apian's ''Cosmographia'' (Antwerp, 1539)]]

All the early Gnostics of whose opinions [[Irenaeus]] gives an account, in a section ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXIII.|i. 23 sqq.]]) probably derived from an earlier writer, agree in the doctrine that the world was made by the instrumentality of [[Archon (Gnosticism)|archon]]s (angels). The brief account given of the teaching of the first two in the list, [[Simon Magus|Simon]] and Menander, does not state whether or not they defined the number of these archons; but it is expressly told of the third, Saturninus ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXIV.|ch. 24]]), that he counted them as seven. At the end of the first book of Irenaeus is a section to all appearance derived from a source different from that just referred to. He here ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXIX.|c. 29]]) relates the opinions of heretics to whom he himself gives no title, but whom his copyist [[Theodoret]] (''Haer. Fab.'' i. 14) calls [[Ophites]]. The Ophite teaching may be used to illustrate that of Saturninus, his connexion with that school being closer than with any other. It would have been natural to think that the number of seven archons was suggested to Saturninus by astronomical considerations; and this supposition is verified by the statement in the later chapter ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXX.|c. 30]]) that the holy Hebdomas are the seven stars called planets. In fact, the sphere of the seven stars, [[Saturn]], [[Jupiter]], [[Mars]], the [[Sun]], [[Venus]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], and the [[Moon]], were supposed to be presided over, each by a different archon. Their names are differently given; Irenaeus (c. 30) giving them, [[Demiurge|Ialdabaoth]], the chief, Iao, Sabaoth, Adonaeus, Eloaeus, Oreus, and Astaphaeus. With this closely agrees [[Origen]], who, writing of the Ophites (''[[Contra Celsum|Adv. Cels.]]'' [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXXI|vi. 31]], [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXXII|32]]), gives the names Ialdabaoth, Iao, Sabaoth, Adonaeus, Astaphaeus, Eloaeus, Horaeus. Epiphanius (''[[Panarion|Haer.]]'' 26, p.&amp;nbsp;91), relating the opinions of what was clearly a branch of the same school, places in the highest heaven Ialdabaoth or, according to others, Sabaoth; in the next, Elilaeus according to one version, Ialdabaoth according to the other; in the next Adonaeus and Eloaeus; beneath these Dades, Seth, and Saclas; lowest of all Iao. It was thought that each of the Jewish prophets was sent by a different one of these seven archons, whose special glory that prophet was to declare. Thus ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXX.|Irenaeus, i. 30, p. 109]]) the first archon sent [[Moses]], [[Joshua]], [[Amos (prophet)|Amos]], and [[Habakkuk]]; the second [[Samuel]], [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan]], [[Jonah]], and [[Micah (prophet)|Micah]]; the third [[Elijah]], [[Joel (prophet)|Joel]], and [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zechariah]]; the fourth [[Isaiah]], [[Ezekiel]], [[Jeremiah]], and [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]; the fifth [[Book of Tobit]] and [[Haggai]]; the sixth [[Micah]] (''qu.'' [[Malachi]]?) and [[Nahum]]; the seventh [[Ezra]] and [[Zephaniah]].

=== Eighth sphere ===
[[File:Oresme Spheres crop.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The planetary spheres were thought to be planes of existence in between the earth and the heavenly regions]]

The ancient astronomy taught that above the seven planetary spheres was an eighth, the sphere of the fixed stars ([[Clement of Alexandria|Clem. Alex.]] ''Strom''. [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume II/CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA/The Stromata, or Miscellanies/Book IV./Chapter XXIII.|iv. 25]], xxv. p.&amp;nbsp;636: see also his quotation, [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume II/CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA/The Stromata, or Miscellanies/Book V/Chapter XI.|v. 11]], p.&amp;nbsp;692, of a mention of the fifth heaven in apocryphal writings ascribed to [[Zephaniah]]). In the eighth sphere, these Gnostics taught, dwelt the mother to whom all these archons owed their origin, [[Wisdom in Gnosticism|Sophia]] or Prunikos according to the version of Irenaeus, [[Barbelo]] according to that of Epiphanius. In the language of these sects the word hebdomad not only denotes the seven archons, but is also a name of place, denoting the heavenly regions over which the seven archons presided; while Ogdoad denotes the supercelestial regions which lay above their control.

Again, beside the higher hebdomad of the seven archons, the Ophite system told of a lower hebdomad. After the serpent in punishment for having taught [[Adam and Eve|the first parents]] to transgress the commands of Ialdabaoth was cast down into this lower world, he begat himself six sons, who with himself form a hebdomad, the counterpart of that of which his father Ialdabaoth is chief. These are the seven [[demons]], the scene of whose activity is this lower earth, not the heavens; and who delight in injuring the human race on whose account their father had been cast down. Origen ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXX|''Adv. Cels.'' 30]]) gives their names and forms from an [[Ophite Diagrams|Ophite diagram]]; [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] in form as a lion, [[Suriel]] as an ox, [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] as a dragon, [[Gabriel]] as an eagle, Thauthabaoth as a bear, Erataoth as a dog, Onoel or Thartharaoth as an ass.

It does not appear that the Oriental philosophy, or the earliest Gnostic systems, recognised any place higher than the eighth sphere; and it is here that according to the account of Epiphanius (''Haer.'' 26, p.&amp;nbsp;91) dwelt Barbelo the mother of all. But Grecian philosophy came to teach that above the sensible world there lay a still higher, and Clem. Alex. ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume II/CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA/The Stromata, or Miscellanies/Book IV./Chapter XXIII.|iv. 25]]) speaks of the eighth sphere as lying nearest ''to noeto kosmo''. Accordingly, those Gnostic systems which are tinctured by Grecian philosophy, while leaving untouched the doctrine of seven or eight material heavens, develop in various ways the theory of the region above them. In the system of [[Basilides]], as reported by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]] ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book VII/Part 21|vii. 20 sqq.]]), Ogdoad and Hebdomad are merely names of place. In that system the universe is divided into the Kosmos and the hypercosmical region. At the highest point of the Kosmos presides the great archon, ruling over the Ogdoad, or ethereal region, which is described as reaching down to the moon. Beneath the Ogdoad is the Hebdomad presided over by its own archon. In one place (p.&amp;nbsp;238) the names Ogdoad and Hebdomad seem to be given to the archons themselves. In any case the names shew marks of having been derived from a previous system, for the system of Basilides itself gives no account of the numbers seven or eight; and the number of heavens is not limited to seven, as many as 365 being counted. In ''[[Pistis Sophia]]'', the doctrine of the higher regions receives such enormous development that the seven planetary spheres are thought of as contemptibly low; and Ialdabaoth, once their ruler, in this book sinks to a demon.

The word Hebdomad occurs also in the Clementine ''[[Clementine literature|Homilies]]'', but its use there is quite unconnected with the teaching hitherto described. The mystery of the Hebdomad there unfolded ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume VIII/Pseudo-Clementine Literature/The Clementine Homilies/Homily XVII/Chapter 10|''Hom.'' xvii. 10]]) is an independent exposition of the six days' work of creation, and the seventh day's rest; illustrated by the six directions, into which infinite space extends, viz. up, down, right, left, backward, forward, together with the central point considered as making a seventh.

The mysteries of the number seven are treated of by Clem. Alex. ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume II/CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA/The Stromata, or Miscellanies/Book VI/Chapter XVI.|''Strom.'' vi. 16]]), and in the source whence he borrowed ([[Philo]], ''de Op. Mund.'' and ''Leg. Allegor''., where the theme is enlarged on, ''khairei he physis hebdomadi'').

== 6 + 2 System ==
[[File:MS-Ogdoas-Aion-2.jpg|thumb|right|The ogdoad described by Gnostic [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] in the 2nd century AD (with the first two named Propator and Ennoia)]]

In the system of Valentinus again the names Ogdoad and Hebdomad occur in the same signification. Above this lower world are the seven heavens, where dwells their maker the Demiurge himself also, on that account, called Hebdomas ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter V.|Iren. I. v. p. 24]]). Of these seven heavens [[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus]] taught in more detail ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XIV.|Iren. I. xiv. 7, p.72]]). Above these heavens is the Ogdoad, also called ''he mesotes'', and Jerusalem above, the abode of [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Achamoth]], who herself also is called Ogdoad ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter V.|Iren. I. v. 2, p. 24]]; [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book VI|Hippol. vi. p. 191]]). Over the Ogdoad is the [[Pleroma]], the abode of the Aeons. Thus (Hippol. p.&amp;nbsp;195), we have the threefold division, ''ta kata tous aionas, ta kata ten ogdoada, ta kata ten hebdomada''. This use of the words Hebdomad and Ogdoad also bears traces of derivation from a previous system, the word Ogdoad occurring in a different sense in the system of Valentinus himself, whose Ogdoad within the Pleroma was probably intended to answer to the Ogdoad outside. Irenaeus ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book II/Chapter XXX.|ii. 107]]) argues from what is told of Paul's ascent to the third heaven against the low place assigned to the heavens in the Valentinian scheme.

=== First Ogdoad ===
In the earliest stages of that evolution we have ([[Irenaeus|Iren]]. I. i.) eight primary Aeons constituting the first Ogdoad. The ultimate conception of God, named the Ineffable Father and who has existed since before the beginning, is described as Depth or Profundity ([[Bythos]]). All around him exists a female power that has been named Silence (Sige). These two deities, Depth and Silence, become the cause, through a process of [[emanation]], of the other [[archetype|archetypal]] beings or [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Aeon]]s. The Aeons are always born in male-female pairs (as [[Aeon (Gnosticism)#Valentinus|syzygies]]), each of which is in itself a divine principle but at the same time represents one aspect of the Ineffable Father, who otherwise could not be described nor comprehended as he is beyond all names. The emanation takes place in the following manner: Depth-and-Silence gives birth to Mind-and-Truth ([[Nous]] and [[Aletheia]]), who gives birth to Word-and-Life ([[Logos]] and [[wikt:ζωή|Zoe]]), who gives birth to Man-and-Church ([[Adam Kadmon#Gnosticism|Anthropos]] and [[Christian Church|Ecclesia]]). These Aeonic pairs comprise the Fullness of Godhead ([[Pleroma]]), and the first eight Aeons that have been expounded here are the Valentinian Ogdoad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Jesus Christ, Sun of God: Ancient Cosmology and Early Christian Symbolism |last= David |first= Fideler |authorlink= David Fideler |year= 1993 |publisher= Quest Books |location= |isbn= 978-0-8356-0696-7 |page= 128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though this Ogdoad is first in order of evolution, if the Valentinian theory be accepted as true, yet to us who trace the history of the development of that system the lower Ogdoad must clearly be pronounced the first, and the higher only as a subsequent extension of the previously accepted action of an Ogdoad. Possibly also the Egyptian doctrine of eight primary gods (see above) may have contributed to the formation of a theory of which Egypt was the birthplace. In any case an Ogdoad 7 + 1 would have been inconsistent with a theory an essential part of which was the coupling its characters in pairs, male and female. [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (''[[Philosophumena|Ref]]''. vi. 20, p.&amp;nbsp;176) connects the system of Valentinus with that of [[Simonians|Simon]], in which the origin of things is traced to a central first principle, together with six "roots." If for the one first principle we substitute a male and female principle, the 6 + 1 of Simon becomes the 6 + 2 of Valentinus. This very question, however, whether the first principle were to be regarded as single or twofold was one on which the Valentinians themselves were not agreed; and their differences as to the manner of counting the numbers of the primary Ogdoad confirm what has been said as to the later origin of this doctrine.

== 4 + 4 System ==
The doctrine of an Ogdoad of the commencement of finite existence having been established by Valentinus, those of his followers who had been imbued with the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean philosophy]] introduced a modification. In that philosophy the [[Tetrad (Greek philosophy)|Tetrad]] was regarded with peculiar veneration, and held to be the foundation of the sensible world. The Pythagorean oath by the Tetrad is well known.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meursius]], ''Demiurg. Pythag''. ch. 7, ''ap.'' Gronov. ''Thes. Gr. Ant.'' col. 9; to which may be added Hippol. ''Ref''. vi. 23, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Valentinian Secundus divided the Ogdoad into a right-hand and a left-hand Tetrad (Iren. I. xi.); and in the case of [[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus]], who largely uses Pythagorean speculations about numbers, the Tetrad holds the highest place in the [[Marcosians|system]].

A '''political midlife crisis''' is a turning point or watershed moment in the fortunes of a governance entity such as an empire, nation, faction, political party, or international alliance. The concept was first advanced by Arab thinker [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332–1406), who compared an individual's decline after reaching the age of forty, with the sedentary decline that occurs in a dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, political scientist [[Joshua S Goldstein]] has used the concept in his 1988 book, ''Long Cycles: Prosperity and War in the Modern Age''.

A political midlife crisis occurs following a prolonged [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of optimism, economic progress, conquest, or other success, and typically features attacks on, or threats toward, a rival power. The attacks are vigorously opposed, ending in stalemate or defeat.

The term "political midlife crisis" adverts to the concept of "[[midlife crisis]]", which describes a supposed crisis in a middle-aged person's identity and self-confidence, caused by events that highlight the person's aging, mortality, and any perceived deficiencies in life attainments.  The concept of political midlife crisis applies the concept of midlife crisis to the concepts of "[[social organism]]" and "[[body politic]]", which view an entire human [[society]] as a kind of single super-organism.

==History of the concept==
[[Ibn Khaldun]], in the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), set out a general theory of the rise and fall of regimes.  A ruthless conqueror with a 
"[[desert]] attitude" establishes a new dynasty.  Over some years, royal authority and ''asabiyyah'' ([[social cohesion]]) enable "expansion to the limit". Then, as in the life of an individual, a turning point is reached.  According to Ibn Khaldun, when a man reaches forty he naturally stops growing, then begins to decline.  The same is the case with a sedentary civilization's culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;  The dynasty's new sedentary culture fosters a love of luxury and pomp.  The people become over-taxed and acquire a "habit of subservience".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;  Their rulers subvert property rights and become weak, dishonest, and divided.  Finally, after three generations—equivalent to a human lifespan—the dynasty becomes "senile and coercive".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, pp. 245, 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  There may follow a final "brightly burning show of power",&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; but collapse of the dynasty is inevitable.  A new dynasty takes over, and the cycle continues.  Ibn Khaldun says:  "This senility is a chronic disease that cannot be cured, because it is something natural."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1978, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 [[Joshua S Goldstein]] advanced the concept of the political midlife crisis in his book on "[[Long Cycle Theory|long cycle theory]]", ''Long Cycles:  Prosperity and War in the Modern Age'',&lt;ref name=goldstein&gt;{{citation |first=Joshua |last= Goldstein |authorlink=Joshua S Goldstein |title=Long Cycles:  Prosperity and War in the Modern Age |url=http://www.joshuagoldstein.com/jgcycle.htm |publisher= Yale University Press |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=October 2017}} which offers four examples of the process:

*The [[British Empire]] and the [[Crimean War]] (1853–1856): A century after Britain's successful launch of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and following the subsequent British railway boom of 1815–1853, Britain, in the [[Crimean War]], attacked the [[Russian Empire]], which was perceived as a threat to [[Company rule in India|British India]] and to eastern Mediterranean trade routes to India. The Crimean War highlighted the poor state of the [[British Army]], and Britain took no further part in European wars until the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914.
*The [[German Empire]] (Second Reich) and [[World War I]] (1914–1918): Under Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]], Germany had been unified between 1864 and 1871, and then had seen 40 years' rapid industrial, military, and colonial expansion. In 1914 the [[Schlieffen Plan]] for conquering [[French Third Republic|France]] in eight weeks was to have been followed by the subjugation of the [[Russian Empire]], leaving Germany the master of ''[[Mitteleuropa]]'' ([[Central Europe]]).  In the event, France, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], Russia, and the [[United States]] fought Germany to a standstill, to defeat, and to a humiliating peace settlement at [[Versailles Treaty|Versailles]] (1919) and the establishment of Germany's unstable [[Weimar Republic]] (1919–33), in a prelude to [[World War II]].
*The [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (1962): The Soviet Union had industrialised rapidly under [[Joseph Stalin]] and, following World War II, had become a rival nuclear [[superpower]] to the [[United States]]. In 1962 Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], intent on securing strategic parity with the United States, covertly, with the support of [[Fidel Castro]], shipped nuclear missiles to Castro's [[Cuba under Fidel Castro|Cuba]], 70 miles from the US state of [[Florida]]. US President [[John F. Kennedy]] blockaded ("quarantined") the island of Cuba and negotiated the Soviet missiles' removal from Cuba (in exchange for the subsequent removal of US missiles from Turkey).{{vague|date=December 2017}}
*The [[United States]] and the [[Vietnam War]] (1955–1975): During World War II and the ensuing postwar period, the United States had greatly expanded its military capacities and [[military-industrial complex|industries]]. After France, supported financially by the US, had been defeated in Vietnam in 1954 and that country had been temporarily split into [[North Vietnam|North]] and [[South Vietnam]] under the 1954 [[1954 Geneva Conference|Geneva Accords]]; and when war had broken out between the North and South following South Vietnam President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]]'s refusal to permit all-Vietnam elections in 1956 as stipulated in the Geneva Accords, the ideologically [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] United States supported South Vietnam with materiel in a [[Cold War]] [[proxy war]] and by degrees allowed itself to be drawn into South Vietnam's losing struggle against communist North Vietnam and the [[Viet Cong]] acting in South Vietnam. Ultimately, following the defeat of South Vietnam and the United States, the US's governing belief that South Vietnam's defeat would result in all of remaining [[Indochina]] "going communist" (as proclaimed by the US's "[[domino theory]]"), proved erroneous.&lt;ref name=goldstein/&gt;{{pn|date=October 2017}}

Following [[Al Qaeda]]'s [[September 11 attacks| attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001]], and the United States' subsequent inconclusive wars in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan (2001–present)]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq (2003–2011)]], initiated by US President [[George W. Bush]], Professor [[Gary Weaver]] and his co-author [[Adam Mendelson]], writing in 2008, cited a survey of 109 historians, 99% of whom rated Bush a "failure" as president, two-thirds rating him the "worst ever". Weaver and Mendelson wrote that the United States had been in its "childhood" before 1898; in its "adolescence", 1898–1945; in "young adulthood", 1945–1991; in "adulthood", 1991–2001. Weaver and Mendelson, from their 2008 perspective, anticipated that the traumas of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush presidency]] would "season [the Unitied States] with new strength, wisdom and maturity", enabling it to move forward from this political midlife crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Weaver and [[Adam Mendelson]], ''America's Midlife Crisis'', Intercultural Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=December 2017}}

The [[European debt crisis]] (2009–present) has been called the [[European Union]]'s midlife crisis in articles by [[Gideon Rachman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Gideon |last=Rachman |authorlink=Gideon Rachman |title=Europe Is Having a Midlife Crisis |url=https://www.ft.com/content/4d277112-7d68-11df-a0f5-00144feabdc0 |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=21 July 2010}} {{subscription required|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roland Benedikter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Roland |last=Benedikter |title=Europe's Midlife Crisis |url=http://en.interaffairs.ru/events/524-europes-midlife-crisis-what-the-continent-needs-to-do-now.html |work=[[International affairs (disambiguation)|interaffairs.ru]] |date=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=October 2017}} and [[Natalie Nougayrede]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Natalie |last=Nougayrede |title=Europe in crisis?

The [[France|French]] decision to invade [[Russia]] in 1812 had been intended to secure a Franco-Russian alliance that would then conquer [[India]], but it ended in a rout and in the exile of [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Bonaparte]]—prompting Stanley Michalak to write that "In 1812 Napoleon failed the supreme test of [[power politics]]—knowing when to stop."&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Michalak, ''A Primer in Power Politics'', SR Books, 2001, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source example|date=December 2017}}

{{Wiktionary|posse comitatus}}
The '''''posse comitatus''''', in [[common law]], is the group of people mobilized by the conservator of peace – usually the sheriff – to suppress lawlessness or defend the county. The posse comitatus originated in [[ninth century]] [[England]] simultaneous with the creation of the office of sheriff. Though generally obsolete throughout the world, it remains theoretically, and sometimes practically, part of the United States legal system.

==Etymology==
The term derives from the [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:posse#Latin|posse]] [[:wikt:comitatus|comitātūs]],'' "power" or "force of the county", in English use from the late 16th century, shortened to posse from the mid 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], s.v. "posse ''n''. 2, ''posse comitatus.''&lt;/ref&gt;
While the original meaning refers to a group of citizens assembled by the authorities to deal with an emergency (such as suppressing a riot or pursuing felons), the term is also used for any force or band, especially with hostile intent, often also figuratively or humorously.&lt;ref&gt;
"All the Posse of Hell, cannot violently eject me." T. Fuller, ''Good Thoughts in Bad Times'' (1645) I. xv. 39.
"A whole posse of the young lady's kindred – brothers, cousins and uncles – stood ready at the street door to usher me upstairs." W. Beckford Portuguese Jrnl. 10 June 1787, p. 72.  (cited after [[OED]]).
&lt;/ref&gt; In 19th-century usage, ''posse comitatus'' also acquires the generalized or figurative meaning.&lt;ref&gt;"I can lick the whole posser-commertatus of yer. Come on, yer cowards!" ''Harper's'' Magazine July 1862, 184/1 (cited after [[OED]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==

===English Civil War===
{{cns|date=November 2018|In 1642, during the early stages of the [[First English Civil War#Overview|English Civil War]], local forces were employed everywhere by all sides that could. The powers responsible produced valid written authority, inducing the locals to assemble. The two most common authorities used were the ''[[Militia Ordinance]]'' on the side of the [[Roundheads|Parliament]] and that of the king, the old-fashioned ''[[Commissions of Array]]''. But the [[Cavalier|Royalist]] leader in [[Cornwall]], Sir [[Ralph Hopton]], [[indict]]ed the enemy before the [[grand jury]] of the county as disturbers of the peace, and had the ''posse comitatus'' called out to expel them.}}

===In law===
The powers of sheriffs in England and Wales for ''posse comitatus'' were codified by section 8 of the [[Sheriffs Act 1887]], the first subsection of which stated that:

{{quote|Every person in a [[Counties of the United Kingdom|county]] shall be ready and apparelled at the command of the sheriff and at the cry of the country to arrest a felon whether within a franchise or without, and in default shall on conviction be liable to a fine, and if default be found in the lord of the franchise he shall forfeit the franchise to the Queen, and if in the bailiff he shall be liable besides the fine to imprisonment for not more than one year, or if he have not whereof to pay the fine, than two years.|[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1887/pdf/ukpga_18870055_en.pdf section 8, Sheriffs Act 1887 (as passed)]}}

This permitted the [[High sheriff|(high) sheriff]] of each county to call every citizen to his assistance to catch a person who had committed a [[felony]]—that is, a serious crime. It provided for fines for those who did not comply. The provisions for ''posse comitatus'' were repealed by the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1186125&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1186169 Schedule 3, Part III, Criminal Law Act 1967]&lt;/ref&gt; The second subsection provided for the sheriff to take "the power of the county" if he faced resistance whilst executing a [[writ]], and provided for the arrest of resisters.&lt;ref name="S8 SA 1887"&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1887/pdf/ukpga_18870055_en.pdf section 8, Sheriffs Act 1887 (as passed)]&lt;/ref&gt; This subsection is still in force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?parentActiveTextDocId=1060203&amp;ActiveTextDocId=1060216 section 8, Sheriffs Act 1887 (as amended)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The ''posse comitatus'' power continues to exist in those common law [[U.S. state|states]] that have not expressly repealed it by [[statute]]. As an example, it is codified in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] under OCGA 17-4-24: {{quote|Every law enforcement officer is bound to execute the penal warrants given to him to execute. He may summon to his assistance, either in writing or orally, any of the citizens of the neighborhood or county to assist in the execution of such warrants. The acts of the citizens formed as a posse by such officer shall be subject to the same protection and consequences as official acts.}}

{{cns|date=November 2018|Resorting to the ''posse comitatus'' figures often{{whom?|date=November 2018}} in the [[plot device|plots]] of [[Western movie]]s, where the body of men recruited is frequently referred to as a ''posse.'' Based on this usage, the word ''"posse"'' has come to be used [[colloquialism|colloquially]] to refer to various teams, cliques, or gangs, often in pursuit of a crime suspect (on horseback in the [[western (genre)|western]]s), sometimes without legal authority.}}

In a number of states, especially in the [[Western United States]], sheriffs and other law enforcement agencies have called their civilian auxiliary groups "posses." The [[Lattimer Massacre]] of 1897 illustrated the danger of such groups, and thus ended their use in situations of [[civil unrest]]. Posse comitatus in America became not an instrument of royal prerogative, but an institution of local self-governance.  The posse functioned through, rather than upon, the local popular will.&lt;ref name="foo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7539&amp;context=jclc |title=The Posse Comitatus And The Office Of Sheriff: Armed Citizens Summoned To The Aid Of Law Enforcement  |last=Kopel |first=David B. |work=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, Volume 104, Issue 4; Symposium On Guns In America.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1850 to 1878, the federal government had expanded its power over individuals.  This was done to safeguard national property rights for slaveholders, emancipate millions of enslaved African Americans, and enforce the doctrine of formal equality.  The rise of the federal state, like the marketplace before it, had created contradictory but congruous forces of liberation and compulsion upon individuals.&lt;ref name="Comitatus"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/law-and-history-review/article/federal-posse-comitatus-doctrine-slavery-compulsion-and-statecraft-in-midnineteenthcentury-america/0CEB8331A196539D1AE2246D48D6D0D2 |title= The Federal Posse Comitatus Doctrine: Slavery, Compulsion, and Statecraft in Mid-Nineteenth-Century America |last=Gautham |first=Rao|date=2005 |work=Law and History Review, Volume 26, Issue 1; Spring 2005, pp. 1–56. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="foo" /&gt;

In the early decades of the republic, before slavery became a major conflict, federal use of posse comitatus in the states was rare and sporadic.&lt;ref name="foo" /&gt; But the federal posse comitatus, quite literally, had compelled all of America to accept the legitimacy of slavery.&lt;ref name="Comitatus" /&gt;  In an exhaustive study of lynching in Colorado, historian Stephen Leonard defines lynching very broadly; he includes the people's courts and even posses (which by definition were led by sheriffs).&lt;ref name="foo" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name="Leonard, Stephen J."&gt;“Lynching in Colorado, 1859–1919” (University Press Colorado, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  Indisputably, historical records link violent lawlessness, and even lynchings, to posse comitatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://siouxlandobserver.blogspot.com/2018/04/hate-normalized-posse-comitatus.html |title=Hate Normalized: Posse Comitatus?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], a federal statute known as the [[Posse Comitatus Act]], enacted in 1878, forbade the use of the [[United States Army]], and through it, its offspring, the [[United States Air Force]], as a ''posse comitatus'' or for law enforcement purposes without the approval of Congress. {{citation needed span|date=October 2018|While the act does not explicitly mention the [[United States Navy]] and the [[United States Marine Corps]], the [[Department of the Navy]] has prescribed regulations that are generally construed to give the act force with respect to those services as well.}}

In 2013, a directive &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.northcom.mil/Newsroom/Fact-Sheets/Article-View/Article/563993/the-posse-comitatus-act/ |title=Department of Defense Directive 5525.5  |work=The Posse Comitatus Act}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] directly addresses this issue: it prohibits the use of the [[United States Army]], the [[United States Navy]], the [[United States Air Force]] and the [[United States Marine Corps]] for law enforcement.

The limitation also does not apply to the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] when activated by a state's governor and operating in accordance with [[Title 32 of the United States Code|Title 32 of the U.S. Code]] (for example, National Guardsmen were used extensively by state governors during [[Hurricane Katrina]] response actions). Conversely, the limitation would apply to the National Guard when activated by the President and operating in accordance with [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10 of the U.S. Code]].&lt;ref&gt;U.

===Notable posses===

====Pierce County, 1856====
In response to the dispatch of militia by the Governor of [[Washington Territory]] [[Isaac Stevens]] to arrest [[Francis A. Chenoweth]], the chief justice of the territory's Supreme Court who was holding court in the Pierce County Courthouse, the sheriff of [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]] deputized 50 to 60 citizens for the defense of the court. The standoff between the posse and the militia was ultimately resolved by negotiation and the latter withdrew.&lt;ref name="kaylor"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Floyd |first1=Kaylor |title=Washington, West of the Cascades: Historical and Descriptive; the Explorers, the Indians, the Pioneers, the Modern, Volume 1 |date=1917 |publisher=S. J. Clarke Publishing Company |pages=164–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Luzerne County, 1897====
Marking the last "significant" use of a posse, in 1897 the sheriff of [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania]] deputized 100 citizens to supplement 50 deputy sheriffs in confronting 400 striking mine workers at the Latimer Mines. Ensuing violence left 19 strikers dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Wilbur R. |title=The Social History of Crime and Punishment in America: An Encyclopedia |date=2012 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=1483305937 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vs9wCQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinsdale County, 1994====
In 1994, after violent bank robbers fled from [[Mineral County, Colorado]] into remote [[Hinsdale County, Colorado]] - which, at the time, had three full-time law enforcement officers for its 500 residents – the county's sheriff summoned the power of the county; more than 100 deputized citizens were directed in house to house searches for the fugitives. The robbers were killed as the posse closed on their location.&lt;ref name="kopt"/&gt;

===Legal status===

====Case law====
Following the [[Baltimore riot of 1968]], 1500 lawsuits were filed against the city of [[Baltimore]] seeking compensation for damages sustained due to the failure of the police to suppress the unrest. The city sought declaratory judgment arguing that it could not be liable for any failures of the Baltimore municipal police, as it was an agency of the [[State of Maryland]] and the city had no law enforcement authority. In rejecting the argument, the Maryland Court of Appeals observed that Baltimore, as an [[independent city]] and – therefore – a county equivalent, was still in possession of the ability to summon the power of the county as that right had not explicitly been repealed by statute and, therefore, remained part of the common law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=City of Baltimore v. Silver, 283 A.2d 788 (Md. 1972) |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2317452/city-of-baltimore-v-silver/ |website=courtlistener.com |publisher=Court Listener |accessdate=July 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court noted:

{{quote|We are therefore of the opinion that the powers associated with that of a conservator of the peace and the power to form a "posse comitatus," which is included in the powers of a conservator of the peace, were powers available for employment by the City, through the Mayor, should the exercise of reasonable diligence have dictated that they be used.}}

====Statute law====

=====State provisions=====
Writing in the ''Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology'', David Kopel observed that almost all U.S. states provide statutory authority for sheriffs, or other local officials, to summon the power of the county. In many cases, civil and criminal penalties are prescribed for members of the public who shirk posse duty when summoned; [[South Carolina]] provides that "any person refusing to assist as one of the posse . . . shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction shall be fined not less than thirty nor more than one hundred dollars or imprisoned for thirty days" while in [[New Hampshire]] a fine of "not more than $20" has been set.&lt;ref name="kopt"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kopel |first1=David |title=The Posse Comitatus And The Office Of Sheriff: Armed Citizens Summoned To The Aid Of Law Enforcement |journal=The Posse Comitatus And The Office Of Sheriff: Armed Citizens Summoned To The Aid Of Law Enforcement |date=Fall 2015 |volume=104 |issue=4 |url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7539&amp;context=jclc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Federal provisions=====
Title 42 of the [[United States Code]] extends the authority to summon the power of the county to [[United States magistrate judge]]s when necessary to enforce their orders:

{{quote|... persons so appointed shall have authority to summon and call to their aid the bystanders or ''posse comitatus'' of the proper county, or such portion of the land or naval forces of the United States, or of the militia, as may be necessary to the performance of the duty with which they are charged ...}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21965">[[File:May Irwin Kiss.ogv|thumb|right|300px|''[[The Kiss (1896 film)|The Kiss]]'' (1896) was the very first sex scene on film from the [[Edison Studios]] of [[Thomas A. Edison]], filmed in the first movie studio in the United States, which drew the general outrage of movie goers, civic leaders, and religious leaders, as utterly shocking, [[obscenity|obscene]] and completely immoral.]]

'''Pre-Code sex films''' refers to movies made in the [[Pre-Code Hollywood]] era between the introduction of sound in the late 1920s&lt;ref name="La1"&gt; LaSalle (2002). p.1&lt;/ref&gt; and the enforcement of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] in 1934, which contained sexual references and images that were contrary to the yet to be enforced [[Hays Code]]. Pre-Code sex films explored woman's issues, challenged the concept of marriage, and aggressive sexuality was the norm. The sexual subject matter of the uncensored period was found within many movie genres, most especially in dramas, crime films, exotic-adventure films, comedies and musicals.

[[File:Joan Blondell banned 1932 publicity photo.jpg|thumb|right|230px|This 1932 promotional photo of [[Joan Blondell]] was later banned under the then unenforceable [[Motion Picture Production Code]].]]

During the Pre-Code period, after the crackdown on [[Pre-Code crime films|crime films]], production of films featuring prurient elements increased.&lt;ref&gt;Vasey p.114&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DH103"&gt;Doherty. p.103&lt;/ref&gt; Studios began putting in extra suggestive material which they knew would never reach theaters. MGM screenwriter [[Donald Ogden Stewart]] said that "[Joy and Wingate] wouldn't want to take out too much, so you would give them five things to take out to satisfy the Hays Office—and you would get away with murder with what they left in."&lt;ref name="Vi130"&gt;Vieira. p.130&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 Warner Brothers' policy was that "two out of five stories should be hot", and that nearly all films could benefit by "adding something having to do with ginger."&lt;ref name="DH104"&gt;Doherty. p.104&lt;/ref&gt; Films such as ''[[Laughing Sinners]]'', ''[[Safe in Hell]]'', ''[[The Devil Is Driving (1932 film)|The Devil Is Driving]]'', ''[[Free Love (film)|Free Love]]'', ''[[Merrily We Go to Hell]]'', ''[[Laughter in Hell]]'' and ''[[The Road to Ruin (1934 film)|The Road to Ruin]]'' were provocative in their mere titles.&lt;ref name="DH103"/&gt; Studios marketed their films, sometimes dishonestly, by coming up with suggestive tag lines and lurid titles, even going so far as to come up with in house contests for thinking up provocative titles for screenplays.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pp.107-10&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly labeled "sex films" by the censors, these pictures offended taste in more categories than just sexuality.&lt;ref name="DH103"/&gt; According to a ''Variety'' analysis of 440 pictures produced in 1932–33, 352 had "some sex slant", with 145 possessing "questionable sequences", and 44 being "critically sexual"."&lt;ref name="DH104"/&gt; The [[trade paper]] summarized that "over 80% of the world's chief picture output was...flavored with bedroom essence."&lt;ref name="DH104"/&gt; Attempts to create films for adults only (dubbed "pinking") only served to bring larger audiences of all ages to the cineplex.&lt;ref name="Sm56"/&gt;

Posters and publicity photos often were tantalizing.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pp.110-1&lt;/ref&gt; Woman appeared in poses and garb not even glimpsed in the films themselves. In some cases, actresses with small parts in films, or in the case of Dolores Murray in her publicity still for ''[[The Common Law (film)|The Common Law]]'' (1931),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021756/ IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt; no part at all, appeared barely clothed.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. p.110&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ina Claire in The Greeks Had a Word for Them 2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Publicity photos like this ([[Ina Claire]] in a publicity still for the 1932 film ''[[The Greeks Had a Word for Them]]''), with a woman lying down, posing rapturously, provoked outrage among civic leaders.]]

Hays became outraged at the steamy pictures circulating in newspapers around the country.&lt;ref name="DH111"&gt;Doherty. p.111&lt;/ref&gt; The original Hays Code contained an often ignored note about advertising imagery, but he wrote an entirely new set of advertising rules in the style of the [[ten commandments]] that contained a set of twelve prohibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pp.107, 110–2&lt;/ref&gt; The first seven addressed imagery and prohibited women in undergarments, women raising their skirts, suggestive poses, kissing, necking, and other suggestive material. The last five concerned advertising copy and prohibited misrepresentation of the film's contents, "salacious copy", and the word "[[courtesan]]".&lt;ref name="screed"&gt;Doherty. pp.111-2&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, studios found their way around the restrictions and published more racy imagery. Ultimately this backfired in 1934 when a billboard in Philadelphia was placed outside Cardinal Thomas Dougherty's home. Severely offended, Dougherty helped launch the motion picture boycott that later facilitated the enforcement of the code.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pp.112–3&lt;/ref&gt; A commonly repeated theme by those supporting censorship, and one mentioned in the code itself,&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in Jacobs. p.10: "Most arts appeal to the mature. This art appeals at once to every class, mature, immature, developed, underdeveloped, law abiding, criminal. Music has its grades for different classes; so has literature and drama. This art of the motion picture, combining as its does the two fundamental appeals of looking at a picture and listening to a story, at once reached [sic] every class of society. [Thus] it is difficult to produce films intended for only certain classes of people....Films, unlike books and music, can with difficulty be confined to certain selected groups"&lt;/ref&gt; was the notion that film was a medium that greatly appealed to the masses and thus needed to be regulated.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pp.106-7; Massey. p.71&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the obvious attempts to appeal to red-blooded American males, most of the patrons of sex pictures were female. ''Variety'' squarely blamed women for the increase in vice pictures:&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. p.126&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Women are responsible for the ever-increasing public taste in sensationalism and sexy stuff. Women who make up the bulk of the picture audiences are also the majority reader of the tabloids, scandal sheets, flashy magazines, and erotic books... the mind of the average man seems wholesome in comparison... Women love dirt, nothing shocks 'em.}}
Pre-code female audiences liked to indulge in the carnal lifestyles of mistresses and adulteresses while at the same time taking joy in their usually inevitable downfall in the closing scenes of the picture.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. p.127&lt;/ref&gt; And while gangster pictures were claimed to corrupt the morals of young boys, vice films were blamed for threatening the purity of adolescent women.&lt;ref name="Sm56"&gt;Smith. p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

In pre-code Hollywood, the sex film became synonymous with women's pictures—Zanuck once told Wingate that he was ordered by Warner Brothers New York corporate office to reserve 20% of the studio's output for "women's pictures, which inevitably means sex pictures."&lt;ref name="Vi118"&gt;Vieira. pg. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harlow still.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jean Harlow]] was described in the ''Encyclopedia of Hollywood'' as "the reigning sex symbol of the 1930s."&lt;ref name="SS379"&gt;Siegel &amp; Siegel. p.379&lt;/ref&gt; Harlow was propelled to stardom in pre-code films such as ''[[Platinum Blonde (film)|Platinum Blonde]]'', ''[[Red Dust (1932 film)|Red Dust]]'', and ''[[Red-Headed Woman]]''.]]

[[Vice]] films typically tacked on endings where the most sin-filled characters were either punished or redeemed. Films explored code-defying subjects in an unapologetic manner with the premise that an end-reel moment could redeem all that had gone before.&lt;ref name="DH113"&gt;Doherty. pg. 113&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of marriage was often tested. In ''[[The Prodigal (1931 film)|The Prodigal]]'' (1931) a woman has an affair with a seedy character, and later falls in love with her brother-in-law. When her mother-in-law steps in at the end of the film it is to encourage her husband to grant her a divorce so she can marry the brother she is obviously in love with, proclaiming the message of the film: "This is the twentieth century. Go out into the world and get what happiness you can."&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pp.113-4&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Madame Satan]]'' (1930) adultery is explicitly condoned and is a sign for a wife that she needs to act in a more enticing way to maintain her husband's interest.&lt;ref name="DH114"&gt;Doherty. pg. 114&lt;/ref&gt; And in ''[[Secrets (1933 film)|Secrets]]'' (1933) a husband admits to serial adultery, only this time he repents and the marriage is saved.&lt;ref name="DH114"/&gt; The films took aim at what was already a damaged institution. During the Great Depression, relations between spouses often deteriorated due to financial strain, marriages lessened, and husbands abandoned their families in increased numbers.&lt;ref&gt;McElvaine (Vol 2). pg. 1055&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage rates continually declined in the early 1930s, finally rising in 1934 and although divorce rates lowered, this is likely because desertion was a more financially apt method of separation.&lt;ref&gt;McElvaine (Vol 1). pgs. 310–1&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, female characters in pictures such as [[Ruth Chatterton]]'s in ''[[Female (1933 film)|Female]]'', live promiscuous bachelorette lifestyles, and control their own financial destiny (Chatterton supervises an auto factory) without regret.&lt;ref name="Vi118"/&gt;

One of the most prominent examples of punishment for immoral transgressions in a vice film was ''[[The Story of Temple Drake]]'' (1933), where a [[promiscuous woman]] is raped and forced into [[prostitution]]. According to Thomas Doherty, the film implies that the deeds done to her are in recompense for her immorality.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pgs. 117-8&lt;/ref&gt; And in the RKO film ''[[Christopher Strong]]'', [[Katharine Hepburn]] plays an aviator who becomes pregnant from an affair with a married man. She commits suicide by flying her plane directly upwards until she breaks the world altitude record, at which point she takes off her oxygen mask and plummets to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 128
*[http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/69235/christopher_strong.html Christopher Strong], timeout.com, accessed November 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Strong female characters often ended films as "reformed" feminists, after experiencing situations in which their progressive outlook proved faulty.&lt;ref name="Vi118"/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14627, Marlene Dietrich.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Marlene Dietrich]], who was openly bisexual, wore men's clothes in public. In a society still markedly against homosexuality and cross genderism, this caused quite an uproar. In 1933 her studio, Paramount, signed a largely ineffectual document stating that they would not allow women in men's clothes to appear in their films to both quell the backlash and generate some publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pgs. 124–5&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Female protagonists in aggressively sexual vice films were usually of two general kinds: the bad girl or the fallen woman.&lt;ref name="DH131"&gt;Doherty. pg. 131&lt;/ref&gt; In so-called "bad girl" pictures, female characters profit from promiscuity and immoral behavior.&lt;ref name="DH132"&gt;Doherty. pg. 132&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Harlow]], an actress who was by all reports a lighthearted, kind person off the screen, frequently played bad girl characters and dubbed them "sex vultures".&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle (1999). pg. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most prominent examples of bad girl films were ''[[Red-Headed Woman]]'' (1932) and ''[[Baby Face (film)|Baby Face]]'' (1933). In ''Red-Headed Woman'', Jean Harlow plays a secretary determined to sleep her way into a more luxurious lifestyle. She seduces her boss and intentionally breaks up his marriage. During her seductions, he tries to resist and slaps her, at which point she looks at him deliriously and replies "Do it again, I like it! Do it again!"&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle (1999). pg. 130&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually marry but Harlow seduces a wealthy aged industrialist who is in business with her husband so that she can move to New York. Although this plan succeeds, she is cast aside when she is discovered having an affair with her chauffeur, in essence cheating on her paramour. Harlow shoots the original boss, nearly killing him. When she is last seen in the film, she is in France in the back seat of a limousine with an elderly wealthy gentleman being driven along by the same chauffeur.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 130&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a boon to Harlow's career and has been described as a "trash masterpiece."&lt;ref&gt;Hanke, Ken.

Cinema classified as "fallen woman" films was often inspired by real-life hardships women endured in the early Depression era workplace. The men in power in these pictures frequently sexually harassed the women working for them. Remaining employed often became a question of a woman's virtue.&lt;ref name="DH131"/&gt; In ''[[She Had to Say Yes]]'', a struggling department store offers dates with its female stenographers as an incentive to customers.&lt;ref name="DH131"/&gt; And ''[[Employees' Entrance]]'' was marketed with the tag line "See what out of work girls are up against these days."&lt;ref name="DH131"/&gt; Joy complained in 1932 of another genre, the "kept woman" film, which presented adultery as an alternative to the tedium of an unhappy marriage.&lt;ref name="Sm53"&gt;Smith. pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

[[homosexuality|Homosexuals]] were portrayed in several pre-code films such as ''[[Call Her Savage]]'' (the first film to show homosexuals), ''[[Our Betters]]'', ''[[Footlight Parade]]'', ''[[Only Yesterday (1933 film)|Only Yesterday]]'', ''[[Sailor's Luck]]'', and ''[[Cavalcade (1933 film)|Cavalcade]]''.&lt;ref name="Vi1323"&gt;Vieira. pgs. 132–3&lt;/ref&gt; Although the topic was dealt much more openly than in the decades that followed, the characterizations of gay and lesbian characters were usually derogatory. Gay male characters were portrayed as possessing a high tone voice and a flighty personality. They existed merely as buffoonish supporting characters.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 121&lt;/ref&gt; In films like ''[[Ladies They Talk About]]'' lesbians were portrayed as rough, burly characters, but in DeMille's ''[[The Sign of the Cross (1932 film)|The Sign of the Cross]]'' a female Christian slave is brought in front of a Roman prefect and seduced in dance by a statuesque lesbian dancer.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Fox nearly became the first American studio to use the word "gay" in reference to homosexuality, but the SRC made the studio muffle the word in the soundtrack of all reels that reached theaters.&lt;ref name="Vi133"&gt;Vieira. pg. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Bisexual actress [[Marlene Dietrich]] cultivated a cross gender fan base and started a trend when she began wearing men's suits, a style which was an anachronism for the 1930s. She caused a commotion when she appeared at the premiere of the 1932 pre-code film ''The Sign of the Cross'' in a tuxedo replete with top hat and cane.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 123
*Siegel &amp; Siegel. pg. 124&lt;/ref&gt; The backlash against homosexual characters appearing in films was rapid. In 1933 Hays declared that all gay male characters would be removed from pictures, and Paramount took advantage of the negative publicity Dietrich generated by signing a largely meaningless agreement stating that they would not portray women in male attire.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty pg. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Indo-European}}
The '''Proto-Indo-European homeland''' (or '''Indo-European homeland''') was the prehistoric ''[[urheimat]]'' of the [[Indo-European languages]] – the region where their reconstructed common ancestor, the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE), was originally spoken. From this region, its speakers migrated east and west, and went on to form the proto-communities of the different branches of the language family.

The most widely accepted proposal to identify the Proto-Indo-European homeland is the [[Kurgan hypothesis|steppe hypothesis]], which puts the PIE homeland in the Pontic-Caspian steppe around 4000 BC.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}{{sfn|Pereltsvaig|Lewis|2015|pp=1–16}}{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}}{{sfn|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015}} A minority support the [[Anatolian hypothesis]], which puts it in [[Anatolia]] around 8000 BC.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006}}&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R645AAAAIAAJ|title=Archaeology and Language: The Puzzle of Indo-European Origins|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|date=1990|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=9780521386753|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gray|Atkinson|2003}}{{sfn|Bouckaert|Lemey|Dunn|Greenhill|2012}} A notable, though unlikely, third possibility is the [[Armenian hypothesis]] which situates the homeland south of the Caucasus. Several other explanations have been proposed, including the [[Neolithic creolisation hypothesis]], [[Paleolithic Continuity Theory]], and [[Indigenous Aryans]] or "Out of India" theory. These are not widely accepted, or are considered to be [[Fringe theory|fringe theories]].

The search for the homeland of the Indo-Europeans began in the late 18th century with the discovery of the Indo-European language family.{{sfn|Pereltsvaig|Lewis|2015|pp=19–38}} The methods used to establish the homeland have been drawn from the disciplines of [[historical linguistics]], [[archaeology]], [[Biological anthropology|physical anthropology]] and, more recently, [[Human genetic variation|human population genetics]].

==Hypotheses==
=== "The two leading competitors" ===
The Steppe theory and the Anatolian hypothesis are "the two leading competitors" for the Indo-European homeland.{{sfn|Mallory|2013}} The [[Kurgan hypothesis|steppe hypothesis]], a revised version of the "Kurgan hypothesis", places the PIE homeland in the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe|Pontic steppe]] around 4000 BC.{{sfn|Haak|2015}} The majority of Indo-European specialists support the steppe hypothesis,{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}} though critical issues remain to be clarified.{{sfn|Mallory|2013}}

The [[Anatolian hypothesis]] places the pre-PIE homeland in Anatolia around 8000 BC,{{sfn|Gray|Atkinson|2003}} and the homeland of Proto-Indo-European proper in the Balkans around 5000 BC. Although it has attracted substantive attention and discussions, the datings it proposes are at odds with the linguistic timeframe for Proto-Indo-European{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} and with genetic data which do not find evidence for Anatolian origins in the Indian genepool.{{sfn|Lazaridis|2016}}

=== Near Eastern model ===
A notable, though unlikely,{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} third possibility is the "Near Eastern model",{{sfn|Mallory|2013}} also known as the [[Armenian hypothesis]]. It was proposed by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, postulating connections between Indo-European and Caucasian languages based on the disputed [[glottalic theory]] and connected to archaeological findings by Grogoriev.{{sfn|Mallory|2013}}

=== Outlier theories ===
A number of other theories have been proposed, most{{vague|reason= just as with "Three popular drugs will be pulled off the market next month for being dangeous and ineffective. But here are all your favorite sports results!!|date=July 2018}} of which have little or no{{cn|reason= one to three reliable sources that each explicitly reject all four would be ideal; several explicit rejections for each of the 4 would also be pretty good|date=July 2018}} academic currency today:
* Modern nationalist doctrines:
** [[Indigenous Aryans]], which suggests a homeland in the [[Indian subcontinent]] in the [[6th millennium BC]], and is favored by [[Hindutva|Hindu nationalists]]
** a 6th millennium BC or later origin in [[Northern Europe]], according to Lothar Kilian's and, especially, [[Marek Zvelebil]]'s models of a broader homeland,{{sfn|Zvelebil|1995}} which is favored by European and white ethnonationalists
* [[Paleolithic Continuity Theory]], with an origin in the [[Upper Paleolithic]]
* [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]]'s theory of [[Sprachbund]] origin of Indo-European traits

==Theoretical considerations==
Traditionally homelands of linguistic families are proposed based on evidence from comparative linguistics coupled with evidence of historical populations and migrations from archaeology. Today, genetics via [[DNA]] samples is increasingly used in the study of ancient population movements.

===Reconstructed vocabulary===
Through comparative linguistics it is possible to reconstruct the vocabulary found in the proto-language, and in this way achieve knowledge of the cultural, technological and ecological context that the speakers inhabited. Such a context can then be compared with archaeological evidence. This vocabulary includes, in the case of PIE:
* [[pastoralism]], including domesticated [[cattle]], horses, and dogs{{sfn|Watkins|2000}}
* agriculture and cereal cultivation, including technology commonly ascribed to late-Neolithic farming communities, e.g., the [[plow]]{{sfn|Mallory|1996|p=347}}
* a climate with winter snow&lt;ref&gt;"The Indo-Europeans knew snow in their homeland; the word '''sneig&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;h-''' is nearly ubiquitous." {{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/8.html |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. 2000 |accessdate=2009-03-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301052033/http://www.bartleby.com/61/8.html |archivedate=1 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* transportation by or across water{{sfn|Watkins|2000}}
* the solid [[wheel]]{{sfn|Watkins|2000}} used for [[wagon]]s, but not yet [[chariot]]s with [[spoke]]d wheels{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=249}}

===Uralic, Caucasian and Semitic borrowings===
[[Proto-Uralic]] and PIE share a core vocabulary, such as words for "name" and "water", and similar-looking [[pronouns]]. This may be due to a common ancestor, or to intensive borrowing, but both options suggest that their homelands were located near each other. PIE also borrowed words from Caucasian languages, especially [[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]], which suggests a location close to the Caucasus.

[[Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze|Gramkelidze]] and [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Ivanov]], using the now largely unsupported [[glottalic theory]] of Indo-European phonology, also proposed Semitic borrowings into Proto-Indo-European, suggesting a more southern homeland to explain these borrowings. According to Mallory and Adams, some of these borrowings may be too speculative or from a later date, but they consider the proposed Semitic loans "bull" (''taurus'') and "wine" to be more likely.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=249}}{{refn|group=note|Anthony notes that those Semitic borrowings may also have occurred through the advancement of Anatolian farmer cultures via the Danube valley into the steppe zone.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}}}

===Genesis of Indo-European languages===

====Phases of Proto-Indo-European====
According to Anthony, the following terminology may be used:{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}
* Early PIE for "the last common ancestor of the Anatolian and non-Anatolian IE branches";
* Post-Anatolian PIE for "the last common ancestor of the non-Anatolian PIE languages, including Tocharian";
* Late PIE for "the common ancestor of all other IE branches".

The Anatolian languages are the first Indo-European language family to have split off from the main group. Due to the archaic elements preserved in the Anatolian languages, they may be a "cousin" of Proto-Indo-European, instead of a "daughter", but Anatolian is generally regarded as an early offshoot of the Indo-European language group.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}

The [[Indo-Hittite]] hypothesis postulates a common predecessor for both the Anatolian languages and the other indo-European languages, called Indi-Hittite or Indo-Anatolian.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} Although PIE had predecessors,{{sfn|Anthony|Ridge|2015}} the Indo-Hittite hypothesis is not widely accepted, and there is little to suggest that it is possible to reconstruct a proto-Indo-Hittite stage that differs substantially from what is already reconstructed for PIE.

====Dating the split-offs of the main branches====
Using a mathematical analysis borrowed from evolutionary biology, Don Ringe and Tandy Warnow propose the following tree of Indo-European branches:{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}
* Pre-[[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] (before 3500 BC)
* Pre-[[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] 
* Pre-Italic and Pre-Celtic (before 2500 BC)
* Pre-Armenian and Pre-Greek (after 2500 BC)
* Pre-Germanic and Pre-Balto-Slavic;{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} proto-Germanic c. 500 BC{{sfn|Ringe|2006|p=67}}
* Proto-[[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] (2000 BC)

David Anthony, following the methodology of Ringe and Warnow,{{clarify|date=July 2016}} proposes the following sequence:{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}
* Pre-[[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] (4200 BC)
* Pre-[[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] (3700 BC)
* Pre-[[Germanic languages|Germanic]] (3300 BC)
* Pre-Italic and Pre-Celtic (3000 BC)
* Pre-Armenian (2800 BC)
* Pre-Balto-Slavic (2800 BC)
* Pre-Greek (2500 BC)
* Proto-[[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] (2200 BC); split between Iranian and Old Indic 1800 BC

==Steppe hypothesis==
{{See also|Indo-European migrations}}

===Gimbutas' Kurgan hypothesis===
{{Main|Kurgan hypothesis}}

In the early 1980s,{{sfn|Bojtar|1999|p=57}} a mainstream consensus had emerged among Indo-Europeanists in favour of the "[[Kurgan hypothesis]]" (named after the [[kurgan]]s, burial mounds, of the Eurasian steppes) placing the Indo-European homeland in the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]] of the [[Chalcolithic]].{{sfn|Mallory|1997}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} This was not least due to the influence of the ''[[Journal of Indo-European Studies]]'', edited by [[J. P. Mallory]], that focused on the ideas of [[Marija Gimbutas]] and offered some improvements.

Gimbutas had created a modern variation on the traditional invasion theory in which the Indo-Europeans were a [[nomad]]ic tribe in Eastern [[Ukraine]] and Southern [[Russia]] and expanded on horseback in several waves during the 3rd millennium BC. Their expansion coincided with the taming of the [[horse]]. Leaving archaeological signs of their presence (see [[Corded Ware culture]]), they subjugated the peaceful European Neolithic farmers of Gimbutas' [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]]. As Gimbutas' beliefs evolved, she put increasing emphasis on the [[patriarchy|patriarchal]], [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] nature of the invading culture, sharply contrasting it with the supposedly egalitarian, if not [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] culture of the invaded, to the point of formulating essentially a [[feminist archaeology]]. Her interpretation of Indo-European culture found genetic support in remains from the [[Neolithic]] culture of [[Scandinavia]], where DNA from [[bone]] remains in Neolithic graves indicated that the [[megalith]] culture was either [[matrilocal residence|matrilocal]] or matrilineal, as the people buried in the same grave were related through the women. Likewise, there is a tradition of remaining matrilineal traditions among the [[Picts]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Archaeology===
The Gimbutas-Mallory Kurgan hypothesis seeks to identify the source of the Indo-European language expansion as a succession of migrations from the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]], originating in the area encompassed by the [[Sredny Stog culture]] (c. 4500 BC).&lt;ref name="Mallory 1989, p.185"&gt;Mallory 1989, p.185&lt;/ref&gt; J.&amp;nbsp;P. Mallory, dating the migrations later, to c. 4000 BC, and putting less insistence on their violent or quasi-military nature, essentially modified Gimbutas' theory making it compatible with a less gender-political narrative. David Anthony, focusing mostly on the evidence for the domestication of horses and the presence of wheeled vehicles, came to regard specifically the [[Yamna culture]], which replaced the Sredny Stog culture around 3500 BC, as the most likely candidate for the Proto-Indo-European speech community.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}

Anthony describes the spread of cattle-raising from early farmers in the Danube Valley into the Ukrainian steppes in the 6th–5th millennium BC, forming a cultural border with the hunter-gatherers{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} whose languages may have included archaic PIE.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} Anthony notes that domesticated cattle and sheep probably didn't enter the steppes from the [[Transcaucasia]], since the early farming communities there were not widespread, and separated from the steppes by the glaciated [[Caucasus]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} Subsequent cultures developed in this area which adopted cattle, most notably the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]].{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}

Parpola regards the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|Tripolye culture]] as the birthplace of wheeled vehicles, and therefore as the homeland for Late PIE, assuming that Early PIE was spoken by Skelya pastoralists (early Sredny Stog culture{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}) who took over the Tripolye culture at c. 4300–4000 BC.{{sfn|Parpola|2015|p=49}} On its eastern border lay the [[Sredny Stog culture]] (4400–3400 BC),{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} whose origins are related to "people from the east, perhaps from the Volga steppes".{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} It plays a central role in Gimbutas' Kurgan hypothesis,{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} and coincides with the spread of early PIE across the steppes{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} and into the Danube valley (c. 4000 BC),{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} leading to the collapse of Old Europe.{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} Hereafter the [[Maykop culture]] suddenly arose, Tripolye towns grew strongly, and eastern steppe people migrated to the Altai mountains, founding the [[Afanasevo culture]] (3300 to 2500 BC).{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}

===Vocabulary===
The core element of the steppe hypothesis is the identification of the proto-Indo-European culture as a nomadic pastoralist society that did not practice intensive agriculture. This identification rests on the fact that vocabulary related to cows, to horses and horsemanship, and to wheeled vehicles can be reconstructed for all branches of the family, whereas only a few agricultural vocabulary items are reconstructable, suggesting a gradual adoption of agriculture through contact with non-Indo-Europeans. When this evidence and reasoning is accepted, the search for the Indo-European proto-culture has to involve searching for the earliest introduction of domesticated horses and wagons into Europe.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}}

Responding to these arguments, proponents of the Anatolian hypothesis [[Russell Gray]] and [[Quentin Atkinson]] have argued that the different branches could have independently developed similar vocabulary based on the same roots, creating the false appearance of shared inheritance – or alternatively, that the words related to wheeled vehicle might have been borrowed across Europe at a later date. Proponents of the Steppe hypothesis have argued this to be highly unlikely, and to break with the established principles for reasonable assumptions when explaining linguistic comparative data.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}}

Another source of evidence for the steppe hypothesis is the presence of what appears to be many shared loanwords between [[Uralic languages]] and proto-Indo-European, suggesting that these languages were spoken in adjacent areas. This would have had to take place a good deal further north than the Anatolian or Near Eastern scenarios would allow.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}} According to Kortlandt, [[Indo-Uralic]] is the pre-PIE, postulating that Indo-European and Uralic share a common ancestor.{{sfn|Kortlandt|2010}} According to Kortlandt, "Indo-European is a branch of Indo-Uralic which was radically transformed under the influence of a North Caucasian substratum when its speakers moved from the area north of the Caspian Sea to the area north of the Black Sea."{{sfn|Kortlandt|2010}}{{refn|group=note|Kortlandt (2010) refers to Kortlandt, Frederik. 2007b. ''C.C. Uhlenbeck on Indo-European, Uralic and Caucasian.''}}{{refn|group=note|The "Sogdiana hypothesis" of [[Johanna Nichols]] places the homeland in the 4th or 5th millennium BC to the east of the [[Caspian Sea]], in the area of ancient [[Bactria]]-[[Sogdiana]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Johanna Nichols]] (1997), "The Epicenter of the Indo-European Linguistic Spread", ''Archaeology and Language I: Theoretical and Methodological Orientations'', ed. Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, London: [[Routledge]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Johanna Nichols]] (1999), "The Eurasian Spread Zone and the Indo-European Dispersal", ''Archaeology and Language II: Correlating archaeological and Linguistic Hypotheses'', ed. Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, London: [[Routledge]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bernard Sergent the lithic assemblage of the first [[Kurgan culture]] in [[Ukraine]] (Sredni Stog II), which originated from the [[Volga Delta|Volga]] and [[Ural region|South Urals]], recalls that of the [[Mesolithic]]-[[Neolithic]] sites to the east of the [[Caspian sea]], [[Dam Dam Chesme II]] and the [[Cave of Dzhebel|cave of Djebel]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Dzhebel Dzhebel], and V. A. Ranov and R. S. Davis (1979), ''[http://repository.brynmawr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&amp;context=anth_pubs Toward a New Outline of the Soviet Central Asian Paleolithic]''&lt;/ref&gt; He places the roots of the Gimbutas' Kurgan cradle of Indo-Europeans in a more southern cradle, and adds that the Djebel material is related to a [[Paleolithic]] material of [[Northwestern Iran]], the [[Zarzian culture]], dated 10000–8500 BC, and in the more ancient [[Kebarian]] of the [[Near East]]. He concludes that more than 10,000 years ago the Indo-Europeans were a small people grammatically, phonetically and lexically close to [[Semitic people|Semitic]]-[[Hamitic]] populations of the Near East.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Sergent (1995), ''Les Indo-Européens – Histoire, langues, mythes''&lt;/ref&gt;}} Anthony notes that the validity of such deep relationships cannot be reliably demonstrated due to the time-depth involved, and also notes that the similarities may be explained by borrowings from PIE into proto-Uralic.{{sfn|Anthony|Ridge|2015}} Yet, Anthony also notes that the North Caucasian communities "were southern participants in the steppe world".{{sfn|Anthony|2007}}

===Genetics===

Three genetic studies in 2015 gave support to the [[Kurgan theory]] of Gimbutas regarding the Indo-European Urheimat. According to those studies, haplogroups R1b and R1a, now the most common in Europe (R1a is also common in South Asia) would have expanded from the Russian steppes, along with the Indo European languages; they also detected an [[autosome|autosomal]] component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic Europeans, which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as Indo European Languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/02/10/013433 Massive migration from the steppe is a source for Indo-European languages in Europe, Haak et al., 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v522/n7555/full/nature14507.html Population genomics of Bronze Age Eurasia, Allentoft et al., 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/03/13/016477 Eight thousand years of natural selection in Europe, Mathieson et al., 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to genetic studies, individuals from the Yamnaya culture have a mix from eastern European hunter-gatherer{{sfn|Haak|2015}} and Caucasus hunter-gatherer{{sfn|Jones|2015}} ancestry.

Many geneticists consider [[Haplogroup R1a]] to be associated with the origins and spread of the Indo-Europeans.{{sfn|Zerjal|1999}}{{sfn|Panjav|2012}}{{sfn|Underhill|2015}} R1a1 shows a strong correlation with the distribution of the Indo-European languages in Europe and south Asia, being most prevalent in Poland, Russia, and Ukraine, and in central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.{{sfn|Panjav|2012}}{{sfn|Underhill|2015}} Two specific subclades dominate, namely R1-Z282 in Eastern-Europe and R1-Z93 in South Asia and South-Siberia.{{sfn|Panjav|2012}}{{sfn|Underhill|2015}} According to Underhill et al. (2014), the initial diversification of R1a took place in the vicinity of Iran,{{sfn|Underhill|2014}} while Pamjav et al. (2012) think that R1a diversified within the Eurasian Steppes or the Middle East and Caucasus region.{{sfn|Pamjav|2012}}

In 2015, a large-scale [[ancient DNA]] study published in ''[[Nature]]''{{Sfn|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015|p=}} found evidence of a "massive migration" from the Pontic-Caspian steppe to Central Europe that took place about 4,500 years ago. It found that individuals from the Central European [[Corded Ware culture]] (3rd millennium BC) were genetically closely related to individuals from the Yamnaya culture. The authors concluded that their "results provide support for the theory of a steppe origin of at least some of the Indo-European languages of Europe."{{sfn|Lazaridis|2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (4 March 2015) [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150304075334.htm Genetic study revives debate on origin and expansion of Indo-European languages in Europe] Science Daily, Retrieved 19 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, archaeologists have argued that although such a migration might have taken place, it does not necessarily explain either the distribution of archaeological cultures or the spread of the Indo-European languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vander Linden|first=Marc|date=2016-08-03|title=Population history in third-millennium-BC Europe: assessing the contribution of genetics|journal=World Archaeology|volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=1–15|doi=10.1080/00438243.2016.1209124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatolian hypothesis==
{{Main|Anatolian hypothesis}}
{{See also|Indo-Hittite}}
[[File:Neolithic expansion.svg|thumb|250px|Map showing the Neolithic expansion from the seventh to fifth millennium BC.]]

===Theory===
The main competitor to the Kurgan hypothesis is the [[Anatolian hypothesis]] advanced by [[Colin Renfrew]] in 1987. It couples the spread of the Indo-European languages to the hard fact of the neolithic spread of farming from the Near East, stating that the Indo-European languages began to spread peacefully into Europe from [[Asia Minor]] from around 7000 BC with the [[Neolithic revolution|Neolithic advance of farming]] (''wave of advance''). The expansion of agriculture from the Middle East would have diffused three language families: Indo-European toward Europe, [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] toward Pakistan and India, and Afro-Asiatic toward Arabia and North Africa.

According to Renfrew (2004), the spread of Indo-European proceeded in the following steps:
*Around 6500 BC: '''Pre-Proto-Indo-European''', located in Anatolia, splits into Anatolian and '''Archaic Proto-Indo-European''', the language of those Pre-Proto-Indo-European farmers who migrate to Europe in the initial farming dispersal. Archaic Proto-Indo-European languages occur in the Balkans ([[Kőrös culture|Starčevo-Körös]]-Cris culture), in the Danube valley ([[Linear Pottery culture]]), and possibly in the Bug-Dniestr area (Eastern Linear pottery culture).
*Around 5000 BC: Archaic Proto-Indo-European splits into '''Northwestern Indo-European''' (the ancestor of Italic, Celtic, and Germanic), located in the Danube valley, '''Balkan Proto-Indo-European''' (corresponding to [[Marija Gimbutas|Gimbutas]]' [[Old European culture]]), and '''Early Steppe Proto-Indo-European''' (the ancestor of Tocharian).

Reacting to criticism, Renfrew revised his proposal to the effect of taking a pronounced [[Indo-Hittite]] position. Renfrew's revised views place only [[Pre-Proto-Indo-European]] in 7th millennium BC Anatolia, proposing as the homeland of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] proper the [[Balkans]] around 5000 BC, explicitly identified as the "[[Old European culture]]" proposed by [[Marija Gimbutas]]. He thus still situates the original source of the Indo-European language family in Anatolia c. 7000 BC. Reconstructions of a Bronze Age PIE society based on vocabulary items like "wheel" do not necessarily hold for the Anatolian branch, which appears to have separated from PIE at an early stage, prior to the invention of wheeled vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Renfrew|first=Colin|chapter=Time Depth, Convergence Theory, and Innovation in Proto-Indo-European: 'Old Europe' as a PIE Linguistic Area|pages=17–48|editor-last1=Bammesberger|editor-first1=Alfred|editor-last2=Vennemann|editor-first2=Theo|title=Languages in Prehistoric Europe|year=2003|location=Heidelberg|publisher=Universitätsverlag Winter GmBH|isbn=978-3-82-531449-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_VxiAAAAMAAJ|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objections===

====Dating====
The main objection to this theory is that it requires an unrealistically early date.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}} According to linguistic analysis, the Proto-Indo-European lexicon seems to include words for a range of inventions and practices related to the [[Secondary Products Revolution]], which post-dates the early spread of farming. On lexico-cultural dating, Proto-Indo-European cannot be earlier than 4000 BC.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|pp=101–102}}

====Farming====
The idea that farming was spread from Anatolia in a single wave has been revised. Instead it appears to have spread in several waves by several routes, primarily from the Levant.&lt;ref&gt;R. Pinhasi, J. Fort and A. J. Ammerman, Tracing the origin and spread of agriculture in Europe, ''PLoS Biology'', 3, no. 12 (2005), e436.&lt;/ref&gt; The trail of plant domesticates indicates an initial foray from the Levant by sea.&lt;ref&gt;F. Coward et al., The spread of Neolithic plant economies from the Near East to Northwest Europe: a phylogenetic analysis, ''Journal of Archaeological Science'', vol. 35, no. 1 (2008), pp. 42–56.&lt;/ref&gt; The overland route via Anatolia seems to have been most significant in spreading farming into south-east Europe.&lt;ref&gt;M. Özdogan, Archaeological evidence on the westward expansion of farming communities from eastern Anatolia to the Aegean and the Balkans, ''Current Anthropology'', vol. 52, no. S4 (2011), S415-S430.&lt;/ref&gt;

Farming developed independently in the eastern fertile crescent.{{sfn|Lazaridis|2016}} Non-Indo-European languages appear to be associated with the spread of farming from the Near East into North Africa and the Caucasus.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} According to Lazaridis et al. (2016), farming developed independently both in the Levant and in the eastern Fertile Crescent.{{sfn|Lazaridis|2016}} After this initial development, the two regions and the Caucasus interacted, and the chalcolithic north-west Iranian population appears to be a mixture of Iranian neolithic, Levant, and Caucasus hunter-gatherers.{{sfn|Lazaridis|2016}} According to Lazaridis et al. (2016), "farmers related to those from Iran spread northward into the Eurasian steppe; and people related to both the early farmers of Iran and to the pastoralists of the Eurasian steppe spread eastward into South Asia".{{sfn|Lazaridis et al.|2016}} They further note that ANI "can be modelled as a mix of ancestry related to both early farmers of [[Zagros Mountains|western Iran]] and to people of the Bronze Age Eurasian steppe",{{sfn|Lazaridis et al.|2016}} which makes it unlikely that the Indo-European languages in India are derived from Anatolia.{{sfn|Lazaridis|2016b}} Mascarenhas et al. (2015) note that the expansion of Z93 from [[Transcaucasia]] into South Asia is compatible with "the archeological records of eastward expansion of West Asian populations in the 4th millennium BC culminating in the socalled Kura-Araxes migrations in the post-[[Uruk period|Uruk IV period]]".{{sfn|Mascarenhas|2015|p=9}}

===Alignment with Steppe-theory===
According to Alberto Piazza "[i]t is clear that, genetically speaking, peoples of the Kurgan steppe descended at least in part from people of the Middle Eastern Neolithic who immigrated there from Turkey."{{sfn|Cavalli-Sforza|2000}} According to Piazza and [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]], the Yamna-culture may have been derived from Middle Eastern Neolithic farmers who migrated to the Pontic steppe and developed pastoral nomadism.:
{{quote|...if the expansions began at 9,500 years ago from Anatolia and at 6,000 years ago from the [[Yamna culture|Yamnaya culture]] region, then a 3,500-year period elapsed during their migration to the [[Volga River|Volga]]-[[Don River (Russia)|Don]] region from Anatolia, probably through the Balkans. There a completely new, mostly pastoral culture developed under the stimulus of an environment unfavorable to standard agriculture, but offering new attractive possibilities. Our hypothesis is, therefore, that Indo-European languages derived from a secondary expansion from the [[Yamna culture|Yamnaya culture]] region after the Neolithic farmers, possibly coming from Anatolia and settled there, developing pastoral nomadism.&lt;ref&gt;Piazza and Cavalli-Sforza (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wells agrees with Cavalli-Sforza that there is "''some'' genetic evidence for migration from the Middle East":
{{quote|... while we see substantial genetic and archaeological evidence for an Indo-European migration originating in the southern Russian steppes, there is little evidence for a similarly massive Indo-European migration from the Middle East to Europe. One possibility is that, as a much earlier migration (8,000 years old, as opposed to 4,000), the genetic signals carried by Indo-European-speaking farmers may simply have dispersed over the years. There is clearly ''some'' genetic evidence for migration from the Middle East, as Cavalli-Sforza and his colleagues showed, but the signal is not strong enough for us to trace the distribution of Neolithic languages throughout the entirety of Indo-European-speaking Europe.{{sfn|Wells|2002}}}}

==Armenian hypothesis==
{{Main|Armenian hypothesis}}

Gamkrelidze and Ivanov held that the urheimat was south of the Caucasus, specifically, "within eastern Anatolia, the southern Caucasus and northern Mesopotamia" in the fifth to fourth millennia BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Gamkrelidze|first1=Thomas V.|last2=Ivanov|first2=Vjačeslav V.|title=Indo-European and the Indo-Europeans: A Reconstruction and Historical Analysis of a Proto-Language and Proto-Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2aqp2n2mKkC&amp;pg=PA791|year=1995|publisher=Moutin de Gruyter|pages=791ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their proposal was based on a disputed [[Glottalic theory|theory of glottal consonants]] in PIE. According to Gamkrelidze and Ivanov, PIE words for material culture objects imply contact with more advanced peoples to the south, the existence of Semitic loan-words in PIE, Kartvelian (Georgian) borrowings from PIE, some contact with Sumerian, Elamite and others. However, given that the glottalic theory never caught on and there was little archaeological support, the Gamkrelidze and Ivanov theory did not gain support until Renfrew's Anatolian theory revived aspects of their proposal.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015}}

Gamkrelidze and Ivanov proposed that the Greeks moved west across Anatolia to their present location, a northward movement of some IE speakers that brought them into contact with the [[Finno-Ugric languages]], and suggested that the Kurgan area, or better "Black Sea and Volga steppe," was a secondary homeland from which the western IE languages emerged.

A 2015 genetic study by Haak et al. (2015) argues that their findings of gene flow of a population that shares traits with modern-day Armenians into the Yamnaya pastoralist culture lends support to the Armenian hypothesis,{{sfn|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015|p=137}}{{refn|group=note|Haak et al. (2015): "The Armenian plateau hypothesis gains in plausibility by the fact that we have discovered evidence of admixture in the ancestry of Yamnaya steppe pastoralists, including gene flow from a population of Near Eastern ancestry for which Armenians today appear to be a reasonable surrogate (SI4, SI7, SI9). However, the question of what languages were spoken by the 'Eastern European hunter-gatherers' and the southern, Armenian-like, ancestral population remains open."{{sfn|Haak|Lazaridis|Patterson|Rohland|2015|p=137}}}} while Lazaridis et al. (2016) state that "farmers related to those from Iran spread northward into the Eurasian steppe."{{sfn|Lazaridis|2016}}

According to [[David Reich (geneticist)|David Reich]], "the most likely location of the population that first spoke an Indo-European language was south of the Caucasus Mountains, perhaps in present-day Iran or Armenia, because ancient DNA from people who lived there matches what we would expect for a source population both for the Yamnaya and for ancient Anatolians".&lt;ref name="Reich p.177"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Reich |authorlink=David Reich (geneticist) |title=Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the Human Past |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |year=2018 |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other hypotheses==

=== Baltic homeland ===
{{See also|Neolithic creolisation hypothesis|Salmon problem}}

Lothar Kilian and [[Marek Zvelebil]] have proposed a 6th millennium BC or later origin in [[Northern Europe]].{{sfn|Zvelebil|1995}} The Steppe theory is compatible with the argument that the PIE homeland must have been larger,&lt;ref name="Mallory 1989, p.185"/&gt; because the "Neolithic creolisation hypothesis" allows the Pontic-Caspian region to have been part of PIE territory.

=== Palaeolithic Continuity Theory ===
{{main|Paleolithic Continuity Theory}}

The "Paleolithic Continuity Paradigm" is a [[hypothesis]] suggesting that the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE) can be traced back to the [[Upper Paleolithic]], several millennia earlier than the [[Chalcolithic]] or at the most [[Neolithic]] estimates in other scenarios of [[Proto-Indo-European origins]]. Its main proponents are [[Marcel Otte]], [[Alexander Häusler (archaeologist)|Alexander Häusler]],{{sfn|Anthony|2007}} and [[Mario Alinei]].

The PCT posits that the advent of Indo-European languages should be linked to the arrival of ''[[Archaic humans|Homo sapiens]]'' in Europe and Asia from Africa in the [[Upper Paleolithic]].&lt;ref name=continuitas /&gt; Employing "lexical periodization", Alinei arrives at a timeline deeper than even that of [[Colin Renfrew]]'s [[Anatolian hypothesis]].&lt;ref name=continuitas/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Mario Alinei: "The sharp, and now at last admitted even by traditionalists (Villar 1991) [Villar, Francisco (1991), Los indoeuropeos y los orígines de Europa. Lenguaje y historia, Madrid, Gredos] differentiation of farming terminology in the different IE languages, while absolutely unexplainable in the context of [[Anatolian hypothesis|Renfrew's NDT]], provides yet another fundamental proof that the differentiation of IE languages goes back to remote prehistory."&lt;ref name=continuitas/&gt;}}

Since 2004, an informal workgroup of scholars who support the Paleolithic Continuity hypothesis has been held online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.continuitas.org/workgroup.html continuitas.org, ''The PCP-workgroup'']&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Alinei himself, its leading members (referred to as "Scientific Committee" in the website) are linguists [[Xaverio Ballester]] ([[University of Valencia]]) and [[Francesco Benozzo]] ([[University of Bologna]]). Also included are prehistorian [[Marcel Otte]] ([[Université de Liège]]) and anthropologist [[Henry Harpending]] ([[University of Utah]]).&lt;ref name=continuitas&gt;[http://www.continuitas.org/intro.html Alinei, Mario. ''The Paleolithic Continuity Theory on Indo-European Origins: An Introduction'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not listed by Mallory among the proposals for the origins of the Indo-European languages that are widely discussed and considered credible within academia.{{sfn|Mallory|1997|p=106}}

=== Out of India theory ===
{{main|Indigenous Aryans|Indo-Aryan migrations}}

The Indigenous Aryans theory, also known as the Out of India theory, proposes an Indian origin for the Indo-European languages. The languages of northern India and Pakistan, including [[Hindi]] and the historically and culturally significant [[Sacred language|liturgical language]] [[Sanskrit]], belong to the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] branch of the Indo-European language family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Indo-Aryan-languages|title=Indo-Aryan languages|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Steppe model, rhetorically presented as an "Aryan invasion", has been opposed by [[Hindu revivalist]]s and [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalists]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Fosse | first =Lars Martin | year =2005 | chapter =Aryan Past and Post-Colonial Present.

In December 1987, following substantial losses, the private, [[United Kingdom|British]] independent&lt;ref group=nb&gt;independent of [[government-owned corporation]]s&lt;/ref&gt; airline [[British Caledonian]] (BCal) was taken over by newly [[privatization|privatise]]d [[British Airways]] (BA).

The prime causes for the failure of the "Second Force" concept and BCal's demise were:
* The unwieldy route structure it had inherited from [[British United Airways]] (BUA).
* The [[Her Majesty's Government|Government]]'s reluctance to live up to the spirit of the "Second Force" aviation policy through concrete deeds.
* The Government's conflict of interest as the sole owner of British Airways as well as the regulator for all British airlines.
* The 1976 "spheres of influence" policy that left both major British scheduled airlines with fragmented networks, thereby putting them at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis their main international rivals.
* The political consensus at the time that was suspicious of private enterprise generally and hostile to the idea of wholly [[private sector|privately owned]] airlines providing scheduled services in competition with wholly or majority [[public sector|government-owned]] [[flag carrier]]s, especially on the high-profile trunk routes.
* Highly restrictive [[Bilateral Air Transport Agreement|bilateral air services agreement]]s with little or no scope for dual designation.
* The cumbersome process to gain a licence to operate a scheduled service during the 1970s and early 1980s.
* The fact that on identical routes with the same fare structure [[passenger load factor|load factor]]s, [[revenue]]s and [[Yield Management#Airlines|yield]]s&lt;ref group=nb&gt;the [[profit (accounting)|profit]] per passenger in terms of the average fare paid by each passenger for every [[mile]] flown, calculated by dividing passenger revenue by [[revenue passenger mile]]s (RPMs)&lt;/ref&gt; are significantly lower at [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] than at [[London Heathrow|Heathrow]].
* Gatwick's location and its smaller catchment area compared with Heathrow.
* The Government's failure to fully accept the recommendations of the [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|Civil Aviation Authority]]'s 1984 airline competition [[White Paper]] that would have strengthened BCal's position at Gatwick by considerably increasing the [[economies of scale|scale]] and [[economies of scope|scope]] of its operation to enable it to withstand the competitive onslaught from a privatised BA.

The route structure BCal had inherited from BUA at the time of its inception was the result of unplanned and unsystematic  growth since the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="nofrills132"&gt;Calder, S.,  ''No Frills — The Truth behind the Low-cost Revolution in the Skies'', Virgin Books, London, 2002, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, [[Sir Freddie Laker]] had begun building up BUA's scheduled route network in his capacity as that airline's [[managing director]]. In those days very limited opportunities existed for wholly privately owned, independent airlines to provide fully fledged scheduled air services on major domestic and international trunk routes. This resulted in a poor fit of many routes in BUA's network of scheduled services, thereby making it difficult to offer sensible connections that could be marketed to the travelling public. It also represented the best network structure Sir Freddie was able to put in place under the then prevailing regulatory regime.

The resulting network of domestic, European and intercontinental long-haul scheduled services from Gatwick was a motley collection of routes. This made it difficult to develop [[profit (accounting)|profitable]] streams of transfer traffic using Gatwick as a [[airline hub|hub]]. Therefore, it was a challenge to persuade people to fly to Gatwick from relatively minor places like [[Genoa]] or [[Jersey]] in order to make an onward connection at the airport to secondary places in [[Africa]] or [[South America]], and an even greater challenge to do this profitably.&lt;ref name="nofrills132"/&gt;

At the height of its commercial success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, BCal focussed on those routes that carried a very high proportion of profitable, oil-related, premium business traffic.&lt;ref name="Atlantic_growth2"/&gt; It even managed to become the preferred airline for high-ranking [[oil industry]] [[executive director|executive]]s based in [[Texas]], by providing convenient, hassle-free connections between [[Houston]]/[[Dallas]], [[Lagos]] and [[Tripoli]] via the airline's Gatwick base. However, this initially successful strategy made the company dependent for most of its profits on a small number of markets whose fortunes were tied to the commodity price cycle, in unstable parts of the world, .&lt;ref name="punchbag_33_4"&gt;''The Caledonian punchbag'', Flight International, 21 March 1987, pp. 33/4&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this worked in BCal's favour when the price of a barrel of crude oil was high during the late 1970s/early 1980s, it worked against it when the oil price collapsed in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="punchbag_33_4"/&gt; It also further compounded the firm's growing financial problems at the time, culminating in the [[financial crisis]] that led to its [[takeover]] by BA.&lt;ref name="choice"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1987/1987%20-%201251.html ''A question of choice'', Editorial, Flight International, 25 July 1987, p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite BCal being awarded several licences to commence scheduled services on a number of high-profile long-haul routes with a good mix of business and leisure traffic, the Government made little or no attempt to assist the airline in obtaining reciprocal traffic rights from overseas governments that would have enabled it to use all of these licences.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Sir Adam., ''High Risk: The Politics of the Air'', Sidgwick and Jackson, London, 1990, p. 458&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="second_thoughts"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%201063.html ''BCAL asks for state shareholding'', Air Transport, Flight International, 19 June 1975, p. 961]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reciprocal_approvals"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%201427.html ''UK abandons long-haul competition'', Air Transport, Flight International, 7 August 1975, p. 173]&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) had awarded BCal licences to launch fully fledged scheduled services from London Gatwick to [[New York City|New York]]'s [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|John F. Kennedy Airport]] (JFK), [[Los Angeles]], [[Boston]], Houston, [[Atlanta]], [[Toronto]] and [[Singapore]] during the 1972 "Cannonball" hearings.&lt;ref name="Atlantic_growth2"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1973/1973%20-%202400.html ''BCAL Atlantic growth'', Air Transport, Flight International, 20 September 1973, p. 467]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="second_thoughts"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1973/1973%20-%202399.html ''BCAL Atlantic growth'', Air Transport, Flight International, 20 September 1973, p. 466]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1973/1973%20-%202871.html ''More money for BCAL'', World News, Flight International, 29 November 1973, p. 886]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it took the [[United Kingdom|UK]] Government four years to negotiate a new air services agreement with the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] that actually enabled BCal to make use of its Houston and Atlanta licences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1973/1973%20-%202206.html ''New world routes for BCAL'', World News, Flight International, 23 August 1973, p. 331]&lt;/ref&gt; Renegotiation of the then very restrictive UK—[[Canada|Canadian]] air treaty that could have permitted BCal to operate a scheduled service to Toronto took even longer. [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]]'s resistance to opening the lucrative [[Far East]]ern route to Singapore to home-grown competition by another British scheduled airline was so strong that BCal eventually only managed to obtain a renewable, three-months exempt charter permit, which entitled the airline to operate a small number of seat-only [[charter flight]]s between Gatwick, [[Bahrain]] and Singapore.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;these flights were exempt from the [[Caledonian Airways#Attaining market leadership in transatlantic affinity group charters|affinitiy group]] rules and not subject to bilateral capacity restrictions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reciprocal_approvals"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%203168.html ''BCAL includes another Atlantic route in new scheduled applications'', Air Transport, Flight International, 30 November 1972, p. 767]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/PDFArchive/View/1973/1973%20-%202158.html ''British Airways/BCAL — open conflict'', Flight International, 16 August 1973, p. 289]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''High Risk: The Politics of the Air'', Thomson, A., Sidgwick and Jackson, London, 1990, pp. 245/6, 316&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="friends82"&gt;''It was nice to fly with friends! The story of Air Europe.'', Simons, G.A., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1999, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the UK Government itself began to undermine the "Second Force" concept from the moment it decided to re-allocate BCal's unused Gatwick—JFK and Gatwick—[[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles International]] licences to rival independent airline [[Laker Airways]], following Sir Freddie's high-profile, public campaign to get his proposed ''Skytrain'' off the ground.&lt;ref name="friends82"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1980/1980%20-%200077.html ''BA to cut workforce and increase revenue'', Air Transport, Flight International, 12 January 1980, p. 71]&lt;/ref&gt; The "Second Force" concept was furthermore undermined when the Government overturned the CAA's refusal to grant [[British Midland International#British Midland Airways|British Midland]] a licence to begin domestic scheduled services on the two main trunk routes between [[London]] and [[Scotland]] from Heathrow, without giving BCal reciprocal access to that airport.&lt;ref name="risk431"&gt;''High Risk: The Politics of the Air'', Thomson, A., Sidgwick and Jackson, London, 1990, p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1982/1982%20-%201955.html ''BMA competes with Shuttle'', Air Transport, Flight International, 7 August 1982, p. 287]&lt;/ref&gt; The "Second Force" policy was finally killed off when the Government decided to go ahead with BA's [[privatization|privatisation]]. Moreover, the CAA undermined the Government's "Second Force" policy as well by awarding [[Air Europe]] licences to launch scheduled services on several routes from Gatwick to [[Continental Europe]] in direct competition with existing BCal services.&lt;ref&gt;''The Caledonian punchbag'', Flight International, 21 March 1987, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; These measures significantly weakened BCal. They also had a detrimental effect on the airline's ability to establish itself as an effective competitor to the major scheduled airlines that were operating from Heathrow.

The conflict of interest that arose out of the UK Government's dual role as the sole owner of BA, at the time by far the largest British scheduled airline accounting for between three quarters and four fifths of the total output of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s entire scheduled [[air transport]] industry, as well as the regulator for all UK airlines meant that the interests of the "Second Force" were not always at the top of the Government's list of priorities.&lt;ref name="second_thoughts"/&gt; This conflict of interest put the Government in a dilemma when it was preparing BA for privatisation during the mid-1980s, knowing full well that this was likely to pose a major threat to BCal without substantial route transfers from the former to the latter, which would have enabled BCal to become big enough to compete with BA and other large scheduled airlines on a [[level playing field]]. At the same time, the Government was well aware that it risked undermining BA's successful [[initial public offering|flotation]] on London's [[stock exchange]] if it agreed to the transfer of several of BA's most lucrative long-haul routes to BCal, as well as the removal of all capacity restrictions on short-haul routes where both airlines were already competing with each other, as recommended by the CAA and requested by BCal itself.&lt;ref name="punchbag_33"&gt;''The Caledonian punchbag'', Flight International, 21 March 1987, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

The "spheres of influence" policy, which the Government had imposed on both of Britain's major scheduled carriers as a result of an aviation policy review conducted in the mid-1970s&lt;ref name="reciprocal_approvals"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1976/1976%20-%200281.html ''UK aviation policy review: first in a long series'', Air Transport, Flight International, 21 February 1976, p. 397]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1976/1976%20-%200282.html ''UK aviation policy review: first in a long series'', Air Transport, Flight International, 21 February 1976, p. 398]&lt;/ref&gt; against a backdrop of huge [[profit (accounting)|loss]]es the airline industry had faced in the aftermath of the early-'70s [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] and which had effectively eliminated long-haul competition between BA and BCal, had fragmented both airlines' networks. This had weakened them internationally in comparison with their main overseas rivals. The resulting weakening of BA's and BCal's international competitive strength was of far greater concern to the latter as it was much smaller than either BA or most of its foreign-based competitors and had a less comprehensive network offering fewer connections than most rival airlines.&lt;ref name="punchbag_33"/&gt;

At the time of BCal's inception, politicians on the left of the UK's political spectrum — in particular, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] left wingers and most of the [[trade union|union]]s — opposed wholly [[private sector|private]], independent airlines providing scheduled services in competition with the [[government-owned corporation|state-owned corporation]]s. These critics' world view had been shaped by their [[World War II]] and early [[post-War]] experiences. They therefore regarded any form of competition as a waste of scarce resources. Some of them were also [[ideology|ideological]]ly driven in their opposition to private enterprise playing a prominent role in the UK's air transport industry.&lt;ref&gt;''High Risk: The Politics of the Air'', Thomson, A., Sidgwick and Jackson, London, 1990, pp. 239, 275, 307&lt;/ref&gt;

Restrictive bilateral air services agreements that had little or no scope for dual designation meant that BCal was effectively kept out of many markets for which it had already obtained licences from the CAA.&lt;ref&gt;''High Risk: The Politics of the Air'', Thomson, A., Sidgwick and Jackson, London, 1990, pp. 458/9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''BCal wins struggle for Milan'', World News, Flight International, 7 March 1987, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Even where the bilateral air services agreement between the UK and a foreign country enabled BCal to be designated as the second UK flag carrier, the airline was still facing numerous restrictions, in terms of the number of flights it could operate and/or the number of seats it could sell as well as the lowest fares it could offer. For example, the [[wikt:Anglo-French|Anglo-French]] air treaty did not limit the number of airlines the UK Government could designate on the London—[[Paris]] route. However, it stipulated that all British airlines' combined share of the total capacity on that route could not exceed the combined capacity share of all [[France|French]] airlines, and that all capacity increases needed to be mutually agreed by both sides. As [[Air France]] was the only airline the [[French government]] had designated to serve this route, this effectively meant that BA and BCal were compelled to share between themselves the 50% of the total capacity between London and Paris that had been allocated to the UK.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;the UK's share of total London—Paris scheduled capacity was raised in 1985 by inter-governmental agreement to 55%, to be shared between BA, BCal and [[Air UK]] from summer 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%200089.html ''More to Paris?'', Air Transport ..., Flight International, 21 January 1971, p. 82]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="capacity_restrictions"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%201340.html ''Preparing for Paris'', Air Transport ..., Flight International, 29 July 1971, p. 154]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bilateral_restrictions"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/PDFArchive/View/1971/1971%20-%202377.html ''Three to Paris'', Flight International, 11 November 1971, p. 753]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%201975.html ''Airline Profile — Number Forty-two in the series: British Caledonian'', ''BCAL takes its place as Britain's third carrier'', Flight International, 3 August 1972, p. 160]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raw_deal"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1980/1980%20-%200076.html ''BA to cut workforce and increase revenue'', Air Transport, Flight International, 12 January 1980, p. 70]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%202690.html ''Liberal aperitif'', World News, Flight International, 28 September 1985, p.2]&lt;/ref&gt; It also gave Air France an effective [[veto]] over any capacity increase, thereby allowing that airline to dictate the pace at which additional capacity could be added. It took BCal 15 years to attain a 20% share of the London—Paris market's total capacity since it commenced scheduled operations on that route.

BCal tried to work around these restrictions by using larger [[BAC One-Eleven|One-Eleven]] 500s in a low-density configuration featuring a [[First class (aviation)|first class]] section on week days and smaller, single-class One-Eleven 200s on week-ends.&lt;ref name="capacity_restrictions"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bilateral_restrictions"/&gt; This enabled it to offer a higher frequency on week days, resulting in a more competitive schedule for business travellers while keeping within its allocated capacity share.&lt;ref name="capacity_restrictions"/&gt;

BCal faced similar capacity restrictions on the London—[[Amsterdam]]&lt;ref group=nb&gt;the CAA lifted frequency restrictions governing BCal's scheduled services between London and Amsterdam in November 1972, overruling [[British European Airways|BEA]]'s objections; this resulted in the introduction in April 1973 of a third daily frequency operating on weekdays, increasing the number of weekly round-trips to 19&lt;/ref&gt; and London—[[Brussels]] routes,&lt;ref name="raw_deal"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%202950.html ''British Caledonian Airways ...'', Air Transport ..., Flight International, 9 November 1972, p. 637]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''OAG Flight Guide Worldwide'', OAG Worldwide Ltd, Dunstable, April 1973&lt;/ref&gt; while other [[Europe]]an governments refused requests from their UK counterpart to have BCal designated as a second UK flag carrier, arguing that there was no equivalent of a "Second Force" in their countries that could have matched the additional capacity BCal would have offered, that there simply were no spare capacities to do so, that this would violate the letter and spirit of the relevant bilateral air treaties/pool agreements,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1962/1962%20-%203036.html ''First foreign refusals'', Air Commerce, Flight International, 20 December 1962, p. 966]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="protectionist_excuses"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1980/1980%20-%203678.html ''BA policy "will fill Swissair first class"'', World News, Flight International, 6 December 1980, p. 2079]&lt;/ref&gt; or that total British market share already exceeded that of the relevant overseas flag carriers when [[charter flight|charter traffic]] was included as well.&lt;ref name="protectionist_excuses"/&gt;

BCal continued operating BUA's former regional routes from Gatwick to [[Le Touquet]] and [[Rotterdam]] for several years to provide additional capacity to/from alternative airports that were relatively close to the main airports where its operations were subject to capacity restrictions.

Some countries imposed capacity restrictions on BCal's operations even on regional routes that did not compete with any trunk routes and therefore could not have caused a diversion of traffic from these routes. BCal's London—[[Genoa]] route was a case in point. The only way the [[Italy|Italian]] authorities agreed to BCal's request to add an additional Saturday frequency on that route was to compel the airline to enter into a pool agreement with [[Alitalia]].&lt;ref name="ch2"&gt;[http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1987/fulltext/219c02.pdf "British Airways Plc and British Caledonian Group plc; A report on the proposed merger"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119185621/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1987/fulltext/219c02.pdf |date=19 January 2012 }}, Chapter 2, Competition Commission website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="risk478_9"&gt;''High Risk: The Politics of the Air'', Thomson, A., Sidgwick and Jackson, London, 1990, pp. 478/9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1980/1980%20-%202377.html ''B.Cal not in pool'', Letters, Flight International, 30 August 1980, p. 738]&lt;/ref&gt; Under that agreement BCal was forced to share its revenues on that route with [[Italy]]'s flag carrier, even after that airline had withdrawn its own Heathrow—Genoa service it had originally operated in competition with the Gatwick—Genoa service provided by BUA/BCal.

Such [[anti-competitive practices]] were not confined to BCal's European operations. The bilateral agreements governing most of BCal's long-haul routes obliged the airline to enter into a pool agreement with the designated [[flag state|foreign flag]] carrier[s].&lt;ref name="ch2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="risk478_9"/&gt; These agreements stipulated that all revenues were to be equally shared by all carriers serving the same route. This usually meant that revenues were shared on a 50:50 basis, regardless of each carrier's actual [[market share]]. The only exceptions to this rule were the [[United States|US]] as well as the [[Asia]]n countries to which BCal flew.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;with the exception of [[Saudi Arabia]]&lt;/ref&gt; As far as the US was concerned, no US airline was allowed to enter into a pool agreement with any other airline — especially, a wholly/majority government-owned, foreign carrier — as this constituted a violation of that country's [[antitrust]] laws. With regard to the Asian countries that received scheduled services from BCal, the UK already had fully [[liberalization|liberalise]]d or fairly liberal bilateral air services agreements with these countries.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;other than Saudi Arabia&lt;/ref&gt;

These bilateral restrictions seriously impeded BCal's efforts to successfully build a network of short-haul, European feeder services that was essential to provide sufficient transfer traffic for its long-haul routes from Gatwick. Furthermore, these restrictions made it difficult to offer its passengers a more frequent service on certain long-haul routes that could have attracted more high-yield business traffic. It also left the airline with an incomplete network, which resulted in a weak route structure. This, in turn, constituted a major competitive disadvantage.&lt;ref name="punchbag_33"/&gt;

As a general rule, a full-service scheduled operation at Gatwick with a fare structure that is identical to a similar operation at Heathrow produces a 10% lower load factor.&lt;ref name="punchbag_33"/&gt; For example, BCal's scheduled load factors at Gatwick rarely exceeded 60%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1981/1981%20-%201286.html ''BCal strikes cautionary note despite 1980 success'', Air Transport, Flight International, 9 May 1981, p. 1292]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/PDFArchive/View/1986/1986%20-%200503.html ''Arabian flights disappoint BCal'', Air Transport, Flight International, 8 March 1986, p. 7]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="punchbag_34"&gt;''The Caledonian punchbag'', Flight International, 21 March 1987, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1987/1987%20-%200072.html ''BCal loses £14.4m'', Air Transport, Flight International, 11 April 1987, p. 8]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas comparable BA load factors at Heathrow were usually above 70%. BCal tried to compensate for this difference in load factors between Gatwick and Heathrow by being a more cargo-oriented carrier than BA. Compared with BA, cargo accounted for a greater share of BCal's total revenues and profits.&lt;ref name="punchbag_34"/&gt;

Similarly, a scheduled service at Gatwick generates a 20% lower revenue and results in a 15% lower yield than a comparable service at Heathrow.&lt;ref name="nofrills132"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Aircraft (Gone but not forgotten ... BRITISH CALEDONIAN)'', Vol 42, No 12, p. 44, Ian Allan Publishing, Hersham, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Heathrow's and Gatwick's respective geographic location as well as the number of people living within each airport's catchment area accounts for this difference in load factors, revenues and yields.

The former has a bigger catchment area than the latter because more people live north of the [[Thames]] than south of it. Heathrow's catchment area includes about three-quarters of London's population and roughly two-thirds of the population in [[Southeast England]]. London is where most of the demand for air travel in the [[Southeast England|Southeast]] originates.&lt;ref name="choice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BCal_warning"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/PDFArchive/View/1983/1983%20-%202044.html ''Share out BA or we abandon Gatwick, warns BCal'', Air Transport, Flight International, 12 November 1983, p.1268]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="regulatory_framework"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%202673.html ''Dan-Air: Britain's second airline'', Flight International, 21 September 1985, p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, for most Londoners, Gatwick was a far less accessible airport than Heathrow in the days prior to the [[M25 motorway|M25]], as a result of its greater distance from most parts of London. In those days it took almost two hours to drive there from central London despite the low level of vehicular traffic. The only advantage Gatwick enjoyed over Heathrow in terms of ease and speed of access was its direct [[railroad|rail]] link to [[London Victoria station|London Victoria]].

The size of an airport's catchment area and its accessibility are of particular significance for the premium travel market. Back then, Heathrow's relative ease of access meant that it could attract a far greater number of travellers who were living or working in London than Gatwick. Moreover, Heathrow's larger catchment area meant that it was able to offer more frequent flights to a greater number of destinations with more conveniently timed connections. This, in turn, helped attract a greater number of business travellers who were the airlines' most profitable customers. It also meant that there were at least four to five business travellers in Heathrow's catchment area for every business traveller in Gatwick's catchment area.&lt;ref name="choice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="punchbag_33"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BCal_warning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="regulatory_framework"/&gt;

This constituted a major competitive disadvantage BCal faced at Gatwick compared with other airlines that were based at Heathrow.&lt;ref name="punchbag_33"/&gt; It was further compounded by the fact that Gatwick had few connecting flights during the 1970s and early 1980s, as a result of the regulatory regime as well as the bilateral air services agreements the UK Government had negotiated with its overseas counterparts.&lt;ref name="BCal_warning"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/PDFArchive/View/1977/1977%20-%200507.html ''Scottish DC-10s and B.CAL’s wide-body plans'', Flight International, 26 February 1977, p. 475]&lt;/ref&gt; (The former necessitated going through a costly and time-consuming process to gain a licence to operate a scheduled service.&lt;ref name="regulatory_framework"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1985/1985%20-%202263.html ''UK rejects US-style deregulation'', Air Transport, Flight International, 20 July 1985, p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; This involved lengthy hearings the CAA conducted for each route application where BA and other independent airlines, which felt the Government's policy of making BCal its "chosen instrument" of the private sector discriminated against them, objected to BCal's application and — in cases where there were several rival applications — against each other as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%200528.html ''CAA's guidance given'', Air Transport ..., Flight International, 9 March 1972, p. 346]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%200867.html ''BCAL/CAA under fire'', Air Transport, Flight International, 20 April 1972, p. 519]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/PDFArchive/View/1972/1972%20-%200975.html ''Undue preference or national benefit?'', Air Transport, Flight International, 27 April 1972, p. 579]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/PDFArchive/View/1977/1977%20-%200504.html ''Scottish DC-10s and B.CAL’s wide-body plans'', Flight International, 26 February 1977, p. 472]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1980/1980%20-%200309.html ''B.CAL clears £5 million profit and seeks One-Eleven replacement'', Air Transport, Flight International, 2 February 1980, p. 295]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''High Risk: The Politics of the Air'', Thomson, A., Sidgwick and Jackson, London, 1990, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; The latter often had no scope for designating a second British scheduled airline in addition to the incumbent carrier. This meant that even in those cases where BCal had succeeded in securing licences to operate scheduled services on routes of its choice, it was prevented from using these licences if it involved an international service where there was no scope in the relevant bilateral agreement for the UK Government to designate it as the second UK flag carrier.) At the same time, Heathrow was the most important point in the world for [[interlining|interline]] traffic with more passengers changing flights there than at any other airport.&lt;ref name="choice"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BCal_warning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="regulatory_framework"/&gt;

Whatever connections there were at Gatwick were mostly provided by BCal itself, at great cost to the airline. Since the early-1970s oil crisis, only the four short-haul BCal routes from Gatwick to Paris, Brussels, Jersey and Genoa had made a positive contribution, with Paris, Jersey and Genoa being the only routes that were genuinely profitable in their own right.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;after allocating all [[Overhead (business)|overhead]]s&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''It was nice to fly with friends! The story of Air Europe.'', Simons, G.A., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1999, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the fact that 40% of the airline's scheduled passengers were changing from one of its flights to another at Gatwick, BCal's dependency on providing this limited number of feeder services was such that withdrawing any of these services or significantly reducing frequencies — even those of loss-making services — had an immediate, negative impact on the [[passenger load factor|load]]s of the profitable long-haul services and, therefore, on the company's overall [[profit (accounting)|profitability]] as well.&lt;ref name="punchbag_33"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ch5"&gt;[http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1987/fulltext/219c05.pdf "British Airways Plc and British Caledonian Group plc; A report on the proposed merger"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109014344/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/1987/fulltext/219c05.pdf |date=9 January 2007 }}, Chapter 5, Competition Commission website&lt;/ref&gt; It was with this in mind that BCal's [[senior management]] had always justified keeping its UK mainland domestic trunk routes despite these losing [[pound sterling|£]]2 million each year ever since BA had introduced its high-frequency ''Shuttle'' service on these routes from Heathrow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%201279.html ''Air shuttles: instant air transport'', Flight International 17 July 1975, p. 95]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LGW-_catchment"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%201280.html ''Air shuttles'', Flight International 17 July 1975, p. 96]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LGWGLA_FrequencyReduction"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%201281.html ''Air shuttles'', Flight International 17 July 1975, p. 97]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%201282.html ''Air shuttles'', Flight International 17 July 1975, p. 98]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%201283.html ''Air shuttles'', Flight International 17 July 1975, p. 99]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="increasing_losses"&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1976/1976%20-%201259.html ''B.CAL domestic loss increasing'', Air Transport, Flight International, 17 July 1976, p. 127]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1979/1979%20-%201617.html ''Caledonian reports best results'', Air Transport, Flight International, 12 May 1979, p. 1547]&lt;/ref&gt; This had led to a reduction in frequency of the competing BCal services from Gatwick as the airport's smaller catchment area did not allow BCal to generate the minimum traffic flows that would have made a competing, high-frequency service from Gatwick viable.&lt;ref name="risk431"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LGW-_catchment"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LGWGLA_FrequencyReduction"/&gt;&lt;ref name="increasing_losses"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%200503.html ''CAA dilemma on UK trunk fares'', Air Transport, Flight International, 20 March 1975, p. 439]&lt;/ref&gt; BCal's senior management estimated that its short-haul domestic feeder flights generated additional yearly long-haul revenues of £5 million and that the European feeder services added £20 million to the company's long-haul revenues.

The Government's decision to permit a limited transfer of routes from BA to BCal, rather than the major route transfer as well as the removal of capacity restrictions on all short-haul feeder routes proposed by BCal itself and advocated by the CAA's review of airline competition policy ahead of BA's privatisation, did not make BCal big enough in terms of economies of scale and scope to develop an efficient [[hub-and-spoke]] operation at Gatwick. This would have enabled BCal to compete with a much bigger, privatised BA as well as the giant US carriers on a level playing field.&lt;ref name="punchbag_33"/&gt; Instead, the limited route transfer still left BCal in an operationally and financially much weaker position than its far bigger and stronger rivals. This increased the airline's vulnerability to external shocks, thereby seriously undermining its financial strength to withstand such crises.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6649">'''Richard of Devizes''' (fl. late 12th century), [[England|English]] chronicler, was a [[monk]] of [[Swithun|St Swithin]]'s house at [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]].

His birthplace is probably indicated by his surname, [[Devizes]] in [[Wiltshire]], but of his life we know nothing. He is credited by [[John Bale|Bale]] with the composition of the ''Annales de Wintonia'', which are edited by [[Henry Richards Luard]] in the second volume of the ''Annales Monastici''. If this statement be correct, then the chronicler survived [[Richard I of England|King Richard I of England]].

In his account of the coronation of [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] in 1189 he was the first person to use the word [[holocaust]] when he described the [[mass murder]] of the [[Jews]] of [[London]], although the use of this word simply refers to a " whole (''holos'') burnt (''kaustos'')" sacrificial offering to a god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Whitney |editor-first=William Dwight |editor-link=William Dwight Whitney |year=1904 |title=Holocaust |encyclopedia=[[Century Dictionary|The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia]] |volume=4 |p=2859 |url=https://archive.org/stream/centurydictio04whit#page/2858/mode/2up |accessdate=2016-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Now in the year of our Lord's incarnation 1189, Richard, the son of King Henry the Second, by Eleanor, and brother of Henry the Third, was consecrated king of the English by Baldwin, archbishop of Canterbury, at Westminster, in the nones of the third of September. On the very day of the coronation, about that solemn hour in which the Son was immolated to the Father, a sacrifice of the Jews to their father, the Devil, was commenced in the city of London, and so long was the duration of this famous mystery that the '''holocaust''' could scarcely be accomplished the ensuing day. The other cities and towns of the kingdom emulated the faith of the Londoners, and with a like devotion dispatched their bloodsuckers with blood to hell.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bertelli |first1=Sergio |last2=Litchfield |first2=R.

==Chronicon==
The ''Chronicon de rebus gestis Ricardi Primi'' (1192), by which Richard of Devizes is chiefly known, covers only the first three years of King Richard's reign; it is practically an account of events in England and the [[Holy Land]] during the [[Third Crusade]]. The narrator of the chronicle is a French Jewish cobbler giving advice to young French Christians intending to visit England.

For the events of the crusade itself, some consider Richard to be poor authority. But his account of the preparations for the crusade, and of English affairs in the king's absence, is valuable, in spite of some possible inaccuracies.

A new reading has emerged recently of the Chronicle mostly due to the inordinate number of classical and biblical references it is laced with (see Anthony P. Bale's article, cited below). Rather than a true historic record, Devizes' account is now being read as an elegant [[satire]] and a challenge of contemporary Christian myths against the Jewish community and its mores; particularly those of ritualistic murders of Christian boys by the Jews of Winchester. It is however by no means a defence of the Jewish community. Others have seen the author as intensely conservative, steeped in the prejudices of his order, and can be seen as being hostile to the [[Jew]]s and to the chancellor, [[William Longchamp]].

Devizes writes in a vivid and epigrammatic style; his Latin shows the effect of the 12th-century Renaissance in its polish and in its reminiscences of classical poets. He describes [[John, King of England|King John]] as a raging madman who ''"emitted foam from his mouth"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGlynn|first=Sean|title =King John and the French invasion of England, BBC History magazine| publisher=Bristol Magazines Ltd|issn=1469-8552|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Salvadoran Civil War}}
The '''Salvadoran Civil War''' was a conflict between the [[military]]-led government of [[El Salvador]] and the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]] (FMLN), a coalition or "umbrella organization" of several [[left-wing]] groups. A coup on October 15, 1979, led to the killings of anti-coup protesters by the government as well as anti-disorder protesters by the guerrillas, and is widely seen as the tipping point toward civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Elizabeth|title=Insurgent Collective Action and Civil War in El Salvador|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The full-fledged civil war lasted for more than 12 years and saw extreme violence. It also included the deliberate terrorizing and targeting of civilians by [[death squads]], the recruitment of [[child soldiers]] and other violations of [[human rights]], mostly done by the military.&lt;ref name="Larsen_2010"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

== Background ==
[[Image:Humberto Romero 1977.jpg|thumb|left|Gen. [[Carlos Humberto Romero]], military president of El Salvador (1977–1979). His presidency was characterized by increased civil unrest and government repression.]]

[[El Salvador]] has historically been characterized by marked socioeconomic inequality.&lt;ref name="Inevitable Revolutions: The United States in Central America" /&gt; In the late 19th century coffee became a major cash crop for El Salvador, bringing in about 95% of the country's income. However, this income was restricted to only 2% of the population, exacerbating a divide between a small but powerful land owning elite and an impoverished majority.&lt;ref name="Haggerty"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haggerty|first=Richard A.|title=El Salvador: A Country Study|year=1990|publisher=Headquarters, Department of The Army|pages=306 |url=https://archive.org/stream/elsalvadorcountr00hagg/elsalvadorcountr00hagg_djvu.txt }}&lt;/ref&gt; This divide grew through the 1920s and was compounded by a drop in coffee prices following the stock-market crash of 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.monografias.com/trabajos41/el-salvador/el-salvador.shtml#caracter|title= El Salvador en los años 1920–1932|accessdate=September 14, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080915015116/http://www.monografias.com/trabajos41/el-salvador/el-salvador.shtml| archivedate= 15 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Army"&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Armed Forces of El Salvador]]|url= http://www.faes.gob.sv/MdnCCp/heroes-batallas/revolucion-1932.htm|title= Revolución 1932|accessdate=September 14, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080619010925/http://www.faes.gob.sv/MdnCCp/heroes-batallas/revolucion-1932.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = June 19, 2008|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 the Central American Socialist Party was formed and led an uprising of peasants and indigenous people against the government.

On July 14, 1969, an armed conflict erupted between El Salvador and Honduras over immigration disputes caused by Honduran land reform laws. The conflict (known as the [[Football War]]) lasted only four days, but had major long-term effects for Salvadoran society. Trade was disrupted between El Salvador and Honduras, causing tremendous economic damage to both nations. An estimated 300,000 Salvadorans were displaced due to battle, many of whom were exiled from Honduras; in many cases, the Salvadoran government could not meet their needs. The Football War also strengthened the power of the military in El Salvador, leading to heightened corruption. In the years following the war, the government increased military spending and expanded purchases of weaponry from sources such as [[Israel]], [[Brazil]], [[West Germany]] and the [[United States]] in an attempt to modernize the Salvadoran army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Haggerty|first=Richard A.|title=El Salvador: A Country Study|date=November 1988|publisher=Federal Research Division Library of Congress|location=FOREIGN MILITARY INFLUENCE AND ASSISTANCE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1973 oil crisis]] led to rising food prices and decreased agricultural output. This worsened the existent socioeconomic inequality in the country, leading to increased unrest. In response, President [[Arturo Armando Molina]] enacted a series of land reform measures, calling for large landholdings to be redistributed among the peasant population. The reforms failed, thanks to opposition from the landed elite, reinforcing the widespread discontent with the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walter, Williams|title=Militarization and Demilitarization in El Salvador's Transition to Democracy|year=1997|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 February 1977 Gen. [[Carlos Humberto Romero]], representing the [[National Conciliation Party]] (PCN), defeated the [[National Opposing Union]] in [[Salvadoran presidential election, 1977|elections]] marred by blatant fraud and voter intimidation by government-sponsored paramilitary forces such as the feared ORDEN, which intimidated voters with machetes.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Robert / Shenk, Janet. El Salvador: The Face of Revolution (Boston: South End Press, 1982), 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The period between the election and the formal inauguration of President Romero on 1 July 1977 was characterized by massive protests from the popular movement, which were met by state repression. On 28 February 1977 a crowd of political demonstrators gathered in downtown [[San Salvador]] to protest the electoral fraud. Security forces arrived on the scene and opened fire, resulting in a massacre as they indiscriminately killed demonstrators and bystanders alike. Estimates of the number of civilians killed range between 200&lt;ref name="Whitfield_1995"&gt;{{cite book |last=Whitfield |first=Teresa |title=Paying the Price: Ignacio Ellacuría and the Murdered Jesuits of El Salvador |year=1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qv9o4qoOnFEC |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1,500.&lt;ref name="Stanley_1996" /&gt;{{rp|109–110}} President Molina blamed the protests on "foreign Communists" and immediately exiled a number of top UNO party members from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunkerley|first=James|title=The Long War: Dictatorship and Revolution in El Salvador|year=1982|pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repression continued after the inauguration of President Romero, with his new government declaring a [[State of emergency|state-of-siege]] and suspending civil liberties. In the countryside the agrarian elite organized and funded paramilitary death squads, such as the infamous ''Regalado's Armed Forces'' (FAR) led by Hector Regalado. While the death squads were initially autonomous from the Salvadoran military and composed of civilians (the FAR, for example, had developed out of a Boy Scout troop), they were soon taken over by El Salvador's military intelligence service, ANSESAL, led by Maj. [[Roberto D'Aubuisson]], and became a crucial part of the state's repressive apparatus, murdering thousands of union leaders, activists, students and teachers suspected of sympathizing with the left.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, 2012, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The Socorro Jurídico Cristiano (Christian Legal Assistance, a legal aid office within the archbishop's office and El Salvador's leading human rights group at the time) documented the killings of 687 civilians by government forces in 1978. In 1979 the number of documented killings increased to 1,796.&lt;ref name="Socorro Jurídico Cristiano 1996"&gt;Socorro Jurídico Cristiano&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanley_1996" /&gt;{{rp|1–2, 222}} The repression prompted many in the Catholic Church to denounce the government, which responded by repressing the clergy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Library of Congress. Country Studies. El Salvador. Background to the Insurgency. [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/svtoc.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian M. A. Serpas{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} posits the displacement and dispossession rates as a major factor. El Salvador is an agrarian society, with [[coffee production in El Salvador|coffee]] [[Economy of El Salvador|fueling its economy]], where "77% of the arable land belonged to .01% of the population. Nearly 35% of the civilians in El Salvador were disfranchised from land ownership either through historical injustices, war or economic downturns in the commodities market. During this time frame, the country also experienced a growing population amidst major disruption in agrarian commerce and trade."

{{quote|A threat to land change meant a challenge to a state where "marriages intertwined, making the wealthiest coffee processors and exporters (more so than the growers) also those with the highest ties in the military.|M. A. Serpas}}

==Coup d'état, repression and insurrection: 1979–81==
{{History of El Salvador}}

===JRG coup October 1979===
With tensions mounting and the country on the verge of an insurrection, the civil-military [[Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador|Revolutionary Government Junta]] (JRG) deposed President Gen. [[Carlos Humberto Romero]] in a coup on October 15, 1979. The U.S. feared that El Salvador, like Nicaragua and Cuba before it, could fall to communist revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=El Salvador : Central America in the new Cold War|last=Gettleman|first=Marvin|publisher=Grove Press|year=1987|isbn=0394555570|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Jimmy Carter's administration supported the new military government with vigor hoping to promote stability in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The killing zone : the United States wages Cold War in Latin America|last=Rabe|first=Stephen|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780190216252|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Carter provided some support to the government, the subsequent administration significantly increased U.S. spending in El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pastor|first=Robert|date=Winter 1984|title=Continuity and Change in U.S. Foreign Policy: Carter and Reagan on El Salvador|url=|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|volume=3|issue=2|pages=175–190|doi=10.1002/pam.4050030202}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1984 Reagan would spend nearly $1 billion on economic aid for the Salvadoran government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reagan and the world : imperial policy in the new Cold War|last=McMahan|first=Jeff|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=1985|isbn=085345678X|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under pressure from the military, all three civilian members of the junta resigned on January 3, 1980, along with 10 of the 11 cabinet ministers. On January 22, 1980, the Salvadoran National Guard attacked a massive peaceful demonstration, killing up to 50 people and wounding hundreds more.&lt;ref name="UN_report_27"/&gt; On February 6 US ambassador Frank Devine informed the State Department that the extreme right was arming itself and preparing for a confrontation in which it clearly expected to ally itself with the military.&lt;ref&gt;United States Embassy in San Salvador, cable 02296, 31 March 1980. The Washington Post, 31 March 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Security Archives, El Salvador: The Making of US Policy, 1977-1984, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wishing to project a populist image, the JRG enacted a [[land reform]] program, which restricted landholdings to a 100-hectare maximum, [[nationalised]] the banking, coffee and sugar industries, scheduled elections for February 1982 and disbanded the paramilitary private death squad [[Organización Democrática Nacionalista|ORDEN]] on November 6, 1979.&lt;ref name="UN_report_27"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the UN Truth Commission on El Salvador|date=April 1, 1993|page=27 |url=http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/salvador/informes/truth.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the land reform program was received with hostility from El Salvador's military and economic elites, which  sought to sabotage the process as soon as it began. Upon learning of the government's intent to distribute land to the peasants and organize cooperatives, wealthy Salvadoran landowners began killing their own livestock and moving valuable farming equipment across the border into Guatemala, where many Salvadoran elites owned additional land. In addition, most co-op leaders in the countryside were assassinated or "disappeared" soon after being elected and becoming visible to the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;NACLA, ''Revolution Brews'' cited in McClintock 1985, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Socorro Jurídico'' documented a jump in documented government killings from 234 in February 1980 to 487 the following month.&lt;ref name="McClintock_1985" /&gt;{{rp|270}}

===Aims of the junta's violent repression===

"The immediate goal of the Salvadoran army and security forces—and of the United States in 1980, was to prevent a takeover by the leftist-led guerrillas and their allied political organizations. At this point in the Salvadoran conflict the latter were much more important than the former. The military resources of the rebels were extremely limited and their greatest strength, by far, lay not in force of arms but in their "mass organizations" made up of labor unions, student and peasant organizations that could be mobilized by the thousands in El Salvador's major cities and could shut down the country through strikes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=United States.

Critics of US military aid charged that "it would legitimate what has become dictatorial violence and that political power in El Salvador lay with old-line military leaders in government positions who practice a policy of 'reform with repression.'" A prominent Catholic spokesman insisted that "any military aid you send to El Salvador ends up in the hands of the military and [[paramilitary]] rightist groups who are themselves at the root of the problems of the country."&lt;ref name="Arneson; Crossroads"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arneson|first=Cynthia|title=Crossroads: Congress, the President, and Central America, 1976-1993|year=1993|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=9780271041285|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In one case that has received little attention," Human Rights Watch noted, "US Embassy officials apparently collaborated with the death squad abduction of two law students in January 1980. National Guard troops arrested two youths, Francisco Ventura and José Humberto Mejía, following an anti-government demonstration. The National Guard received permission to bring the youths onto Embassy grounds. Shortly thereafter, a private car drove into the Embassy parking lot. Men in civilian dress put the students in the trunk of their car and drove away. Ventura and Mejía were never seen again."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/pdfs/e/elsalvdr/elsalv938.pdf "El Salvador Accountability and Human Rights: the Report of the United Nations Commission on the Truth for El Salvador"] Human Rights Watch, August 10, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivation for the resistance===

As the government began to expand its violence towards its citizens, not only through death squads but also through the military, any group of citizens that attempted to provide any form of support whether physically or verbally ran the risk of death. Even so, many still chose to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Insurgent Collective Action and Civil War in El Salvador|last=Wood|first=Elisabeth J.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0521010504|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the violence was not limited to just activists but also to anyone who promoted ideas that "questioned official policy" were tacitly assumed to be subversive against the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Insurgent Collective Action and Civil War in El Salvador|last=Wood|first=Elisabeth J.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0521010504|location=|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A marginalized group that metamorphosed into a guerilla force that would end up confronting these government forces manifested itself in ''campesinos'' or peasants. Many of these insurgents joined collective action campaigns for material gain; however, in the Salvadoran Civil War, many peasants cited reasons other than material benefits in their decision to join the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Insurgent Collective Action and Civil War in El Salvador|last=Wood|first=Elisabeth J.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0521010504|location=|pages=18, 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piety was a popular reason for joining the insurrection because they saw their participation as a way of not only advancing a personal cause but a communal sentiment of divine justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Insurgent Collective Action and Civil War in El Salvador|last=Wood|first=Elisabeth J.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0521010504|location=|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even prior to the Civil War, numerous insurgents took part in other campaigns that tackled social changes much more directly, not only the lack of political representation but also the lack of economic and social opportunities not afforded to their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Insurgent Collective Action and Civil War in El Salvador|last=Wood|first=Elisabeth J.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0521010504|location=|pages=18, 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the insurgents in the Civil War viewed their support of the insurrection as a demonstration of their opposition to the powerful elite's unfair treatment of peasant communities that they experienced on an everyday basis, so there was a class element associated with these insurgencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Insurgent Collective Action and Civil War in El Salvador|last=Wood|first=Elisabeth J.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0521010504|location=|pages=11, 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reveled in their fight against injustice and in their belief that they were writing their own story, an emotion that Elisabeth Wood titled "pleasure of agency."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Insurgent Collective Action and Civil War in El Salvador|last=Wood|first=Elisabeth J.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0521010504|location=|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peasants' organization thus centered on using their struggle to unite against their oppressors, not only towards the government but the elites as well. A struggle that would soon evolve itself into a political machine that came to be associated with the FMLN.

In the early months of 1980, Salvadoran guerilla groups, workers, communists, and socialists, unified to form the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN.)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The FMLN immediately announced plans for an insurrection against the government, which began on 10 January 1981 with the FMLN's first major attack. The attack established FMLN control of most of [[Morazán Department|Morazán]] and [[Chalatenango Department|Chalatenango]] departments for the war's duration. Attacks were also launched on military targets throughout the country, leaving hundreds of people dead. FMLN Insurgents ranged from children to the elderly, both male and female, and most were trained in FMLN camps in the mountains and jungles of El Salvador to learn military techniques.

Much later, in November 1989, FMLN launched a large offensive that caught Salvadoran military off guard and succeeded in taking control of large sections of the country and entering the capital, [[San Salvador]]. In San Salvador, the FMLN quickly took control of many of the poor neighborhoods as the military bombed their positions—including residential neighborhoods to drive out the FMLN. This large FLMN offensive was unsuccessful in overthrowing the government but did convince the government that the FLMN cannot be defeated using force of arms and that a negotiated settlement with the FLMN would be necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsmitha.com/h2/ch24salvador.htm Macrohistory and World Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder of Archbishop Romero===

In February 1980 Archbishop [[Óscar Romero]] published an open letter to US President [[Jimmy Carter]] in which he pleaded with him to suspend the United States' ongoing program of military aid to the Salvadoran regime. He advised Carter that "Political power is in the hands of the armed forces. They know only how to repress the people and defend the interests of the Salvadoran oligarchy." Romero warned that US support would only "sharpen the injustice and [[Political repression|repression]] against the organizations of the people which repeatedly have been struggling to gain respect for their fundamental human rights."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB339/index.htm "Learn from History", 31st Anniversary of the Assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero"] The National Security Archive, March 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 March 1980, the Archbishop was assassinated while celebrating Mass, the day after he called upon Salvadoran soldiers and security force members to not follow their orders to kill Salvadoran civilians. President Jimmy Carter stated this was a "shocking and unconscionable act".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=33182|title=Jimmy Carter: Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero Statement on the Death of the Archbishop of San Salvador.|work=ucsb.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his funeral a week later, government-sponsored snipers in the National Palace and on the periphery of the Gerardo Barrios Plaza were responsible for the shooting of 42 mourners.&lt;ref name="Stanley_2015"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Brunn|editor-first=Stanley D.|date=2015 |title=The Changing World Religion Map: Sacred Places, Identities, Practices and Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGh-BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA1962#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer]] |page=1962 |isbn=9401793751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 May 1980, former Army Major [[Roberto D'Aubuisson]] was arrested with a group of civilians and soldiers at a farm. The raiders found documents connecting him and the civilians as organizers and financiers of the death squad who killed Archbishop Romero, and of plotting a ''coup d'état'' against the JRG. Their arrest provoked right-wing terrorist threats and institutional pressures forcing the JRG to release D'Aubuisson. In 1993, a U.N. investigation confirmed that D'Aubuisson ordered the assassination.&lt;ref name="nizkor"&gt;''[http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/salvador/informes/truth.html Report of the UN Truth Commission on El Salvador]'', April 1, 1993, from the Equipo Nizkor/Derechos site. Retrieved 2008-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

A week after the arrest of Roberto D'Aubuisson, the National Guard and the newly reorganized paramilitary Organización Democrática Nacionalista ([[ORDEN]]), with the cooperation of the [[Military of Honduras]], carried out a large massacre at the [[Sumpul River]] on May 14, 1980, in which an estimated 600 civilians were killed, mostly women and children. Escaping villagers were prevented from crossing the river by the Honduran armed forces, "and then killed by Salvadoran troops who fired on them in cold blood."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/salvador/informes/truth.html "Sumpul River (1980) 121"] Report of the UN Truth Commission on El Salvador, 1 April 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of 1980, the Salvadoran Army and three main security forces (National Guard, National Police and Treasury Police) were estimated to have killed 11,895 people, mostly peasants, trade unionists, teachers, students, journalists, human rights advocates, priests, and other prominent demographics among the popular movement.&lt;ref name="Socorro Jurídico Cristiano 1996"/&gt; Human rights organizations judged the Salvadoran government to have among the worst human rights records in the hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coha.org/Press%20Release%20Archives/1981/81.1.pdf "Guatemala and El Salvador: Latin America's worst human rights violators in 1980"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213214948/http://www.coha.org/Press%20Release%20Archives/1981/81.1.pdf |date=2011-02-13 }} The Council on Hemispheric Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;

===Murder and rape of US nuns===

On December 2, 1980, members of the Salvadoran National Guard were suspected to have [[1980 murders of U.S. missionaries in El Salvador|raped and murdered four American nuns and a laywoman]]. [[Maryknoll]] missionary nuns [[Maura Clarke]], [[Ita Ford]], and Ursuline nun [[Dorothy Kazel]], and [[laity|laywoman]] [[Jean Donovan]] were on a Catholic relief mission providing food, shelter, transport, medical care, and burial to death squad victims. U.S. military aid was briefly cut off in response to the murders but would be renewed within six weeks. The outgoing Carter administration increased military aid to the Salvadoran armed forces to $10 million which included $5 million in rifles, ammunition, grenades and helicopters.&lt;ref name="Carter Salvador Arms"&gt;{{cite news|title=Guerillas regroup as Carter switches on Salvador arms|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/25/weekinreview/the-world-in-summary-guerrillas-regroup-as-carter-switches-on-salvador-arms.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 January 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In justifying these arms shipments, the administration claimed that the regime had taken "positive steps" to investigate the murder of four American nuns, but this was disputed by US Ambassador, [[Robert White (ambassador)|Robert E. White]], who said that he could find no evidence the junta was "conducting a serious investigation." &lt;ref name="Carter Salvador Arms"/&gt; White was dismissed from the foreign service by the Reagan Administration after he had refused to participate in a coverup of the Salvadoran military's responsibility for the murders at the behest of Secretary of State [[Alexander Haig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bonner |first=Raymond |date=November 9, 2014|title=Bringing El Salvador Nun Killers to Justice|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/bringing-el-salvador-nun-killers-to-justice|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|location= |access-date=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repression stepped up===

Other countries allied with the United States also intervened in El Salvador. The military government in Chile provided substantial training and tactical advice to the Salvadoran Armed Forces, such that the Salvadoran high command bestowed upon General [[Augusto Pinochet]] the prestigious [[Order of José Matías Delgado]] in May 1981 for his government's avid support.

During the same month, the [[Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador|JRG]] strengthened the state of siege, imposed by President [[Carlos Humberto Romero]] in May 1979, by declaring [[martial law]] and adopting a new set of [[curfew]] regulations.&lt;ref&gt;National Security Archive 1989, p. 25-72&lt;/ref&gt; Between January 12 and February 19, 1981, 168 persons were killed by the security forces for violating curfew.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International. Amnesty International Report 1982 (London: AI, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Draining the Sea"==

In its effort to defeat the insurgency, the [[Salvadoran Armed Forces]] carried out a "scorched earth" strategy, adopting tactics similar to those being employed by the [[Counter-insurgency|counterinsurgency]] in neighboring [[Guatemalan civil war|Guatemala]]. These tactics were primarily derived and adapted from U.S. strategy during the [[Vietnam War]] and taught by American military advisors.&lt;ref name="statecraft.org"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.statecraft.org/chapter10.html |title=Instruments of Statecraft: U.S. Guerilla Warfare, Counterinsurgency, and Counterterrorism, 1940-1990 |author=Michael McClintock |date=1992}} Web project by Michael McClintock based on his 1992 book by the same name published by Pantheon Books, a division of Random House, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  An integral part of the Salvadoran Army's counterinsurgency strategy entailed "draining the sea" or "drying up the ocean," that is, eliminating the insurgency by eradicating its support base in the countryside. The primary target was the civilian population – displacing or killing them in order to remove any possible base of support for the rebels. The concept of "draining the sea" had its basis in a doctrine by [[Mao Zedong]] which emphasized that "The guerrilla must move amongst the people as a fish swims in the sea."&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg 1991: 62-3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aryeh Neier]], the executive director of [[Americas Watch]], wrote in a 1984 review about the scorched earth approach: "This may be an effective strategy for winning the war. It is, however, a strategy that involves the use of terror tactics—bombings, [[strafing]]s, shellings and, occasionally, massacres of civilians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Draining the sea|year=1985|publisher=Americas Watch Committee|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=aW5_UNi2NIye8gT3soHYBQ&amp;id=sFIPAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1983, guerrilla strongholds were found by U.S. reconnaissance planes that relayed intelligence to the Salvadoran military.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-07-17/news/mn-7813_1_air-war "El Salvador Intensifies Its Air War Against Guerrillas"] Los Angeles Times, July 17, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MLcwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=sPsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4731,1183111&amp;dq=us+reconnaissance+indiscriminate+bombing+salvador&amp;hl=en "Salvadoran air force taking bigger role in war"] Associated Press, May 19, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scorched earth offensives of 1981===
On 15 March 1981, the Salvadoran Army began a "sweep" operation in [[Cabañas Department]] in northern El Salvador near the [[Honduras|Honduran]] border. The sweep was accompanied by the use of scorched earth tactics by the Salvadoran Army and indiscriminate killings of anyone captured by the army. Those displaced by the "sweep" who were not killed outright fled the advance of the Salvadoran Army; hiding in caves and under trees to evade capture and probable summary execution. On 18 March, three days after the sweep in Cabañas began, 4-8,000 survivors of the sweep (mostly women and children) attempted to cross the [[Rio Lempa]] into Honduras to flee violence. There, they were caught between Salvadoran and Honduran troops. The Salvadoran Air Force, subsequently bombed and strafed the fleeing civilians with [[machine gun]] fire, killing hundreds. Among the dead were at least 189 persons who were unaccounted for and registered as "disappeared" during the operation.&lt;ref&gt;UN Truth Commission for El Salvador, From Madness to Hope, 1993, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

A second offensive was launched, also in Cabañas Department, on 11 November 1981 in which 1,200 troops were mobilized including members of the [[Atlacatl Battalion]]. Atlacatl was a rapid response [[counter-insurgency]] battalion organized at the US Army [[School of the Americas]] in [[Panama]] in 1980. Atlacatl soldiers were equipped and directed by U.S. military advisers operating in El Salvador&lt;ref name="LwkC 1990, pp. 224-225"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_c8umnadLwkC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s "A Year of Reckoning: El Salvador a Decade After the Assassination of Archbishop Romero"] Human Rights Watch, 1990, pp. 224-225&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nl.newsbank.com"&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_multi=PI|&amp;p_product=PHNP&amp;p_theme=phnp&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=Title%28HOW%20U.S.%20ADVISERS%20RUN%20THE%20WAR%20IN%20EL%20SALVADOR%29%20AND%20date%28all%29&amp;p_field_advanced-0=title&amp;p_text_advanced-0=%28%22HOW%20U.S.%20ADVISERS%20RUN%20THE%20WAR%20IN%20EL%20SALVADOR%22%29&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no "HOW U.S. ADVISERS RUN THE WAR IN EL SALVADOR"] Philadelphia Inquirer, May 29, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and were described as "the pride of the United States military team in San Salvador.

The November 1981 operation was commanded by Lt. Col. [[Sigifredo Ochoa]], a former Treasury Police chief with a reputation for brutality. Ochoa was close associate of Major Roberto D'Aubuisson and was alleged to have been involved in the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero. D'Aubuisson and Ochoa were both members of [[La Tandona]], the class of 1966 at the [[Escuela Militar]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ochoa &amp; Romero Assassination'', CIA Document dated 9 Oct. 1980&lt;/ref&gt; From the start, the invasion of Cabanas was described as a "cleansing" operation by official sources.&lt;ref&gt;"Limpieza total de la guerrilla en Cabañas," Diario Latino, November 20, 1981, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of civilians were massacred by the army as Col. Ochoa's troops moved through the villages. Col. Ochoa claimed that hundreds of guerrillas had been killed but was able to show journalists only fifteen captured weapons, half of them virtual antiques, suggesting that most of those killed in the sweep were unarmed.&lt;ref&gt;[[United Press International]], 22 December 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

===El Mozote Massacre===
This operation was followed by additional "sweeps" through [[Morazán Department]], spearheaded by the Atlacatl Battalion. On December 11, 1981, one month after the "sweep" through Cabañas, the Battalion occupied the village of [[El Mozote]] and massacred at least 733 and possibly up to 1,000 unarmed civilians, including women and 146 children, in what became known as the [[El Mozote Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Bonner (January 27, 1982). "Massacre of Hundreds Reported In Salvador Village," The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[The Huffington Post]], "Revisiting American Involvement in El Salvador: The Massacre at El Mozote," https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jon-santiago/revisiting-american-invol_b_177841.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The Atlacatl soldiers accused the adults of collaborating with the guerrillas. The field commander said they were under orders to kill everyone, including the children, who he asserted would just grow up to become guerrillas if they let them live. "We were going to make an example of these people," he said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.markdanner.com/articles/show/the_truth_of_el_mozote "The Truth of El Mozote"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BvSC8Irn?url=http://www.markdanner.com/articles/show/the_truth_of_el_mozote |date=2012-11-04 }} Mark Danner, New Yorker, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

The US steadfastly denied the existence of the El Mozote massacre, dismissing reports of it as leftist "propaganda," until secret US cables were declassified in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Nation]], 15 Apr. 2016, "Time for a US Apology to El Salvador," https://www.thenation.com/article/time-for-a-us-apology-to-el-salvador/&lt;/ref&gt; The US government and its allies in US media smeared reporters of American newspapers who reported on the atrocity and, more generally, undertook a campaign of whitewashing the human rights record of the Salvadoran military and the US role in arming, training and guiding it. The smears, according to journalists like [[Michael Massing]] writing in the [[Columbia Journalism Review]] and [[Anthony Lewis]], made other American journalists tone down their reporting on the crimes of the Salvadoran regime and the US role in supporting the regime.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/changing-times-the-vindication-of-raymond-bonner/Content?oid=881757|title=Changing Times: The Vindication of Raymond Bonner|author=Michael Miner|date=April 15, 1993|publisher=Chicago Reader}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Sean Wilentz]], "The Age of Reagan: A History, 1974-2008", (New York: HarperCollins, 2008), p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LwkC 1990, pp. 224-225"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nl.newsbank.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/salvador/informes/truth.html "LETTER DATED 29 MARCH 1993 FROM THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ADDRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL"], S/25500, Report of the UN Truth Commission on El Salvador, 1 Apr. 1993&lt;/ref&gt; As details became more widely known, the event became recognized as one of the worst atrocities of the conflict.

In its report covering 1981, [[Amnesty International]] identified "regular security and military units as responsible for widespread torture, mutilation and killings of noncombatant civilians from all sectors of Salvadoran society." The report also stated that the killing of civilians by state security forces became increasingly systematic with the implementation of more methodical killing strategies, which allegedly included use of a meat packing plant to dispose of human remains.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, Amnesty International Report 1982 (London: AI, 1981), p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; Between August 20 and August 25, 1981, eighty-three decapitations were reported.

The repression in rural areas resulted in the displacement of large portions of the rural populace, and many peasants fled. Of those who fled or were displaced, some 20,000 resided in makeshift refugee centers on the Honduran border in conditions of poverty, starvation and disease.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/684011831.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+27%2C+1981&amp;author=Stephen+Kinzer+Globe+Correspondent&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=EL+SALVADOR%3B+INTIMIDATION%2C+STRONG+ARMY+BLAMED+AS+REVOLT+FIZZLES&amp;pqatl=google "El Salvador; Intimidation, Strong Army Blamed as Revolt Fizzles"] ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Jan 27, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The army and death squads forced many of them to flee to the United States, but most were denied asylum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/19/world/central-americans-feel-sting-of-new-us-immigration-law.html "Central Americans Feel Sting Of New U.S. Immigration Law"] The New York Times, April 19, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; A [[US Congress|US congressional]] delegation that on January 17–18, 1981, visited the refugee camps in El Salvador on a fact finding mission submitted a report to Congress which found that: "the Salvadoran method of 'drying up the ocean' is to eliminate entire villages from the map, to isolate the guerrillas, and deny them any rural base off which they can feed."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=T7n_T_LtFYb28gT5-6SfCA&amp;id=v_pcI9_7nvYC&amp;dq.

In total, ''Socorro Jurídico'' registered 13,353 individual cases of summary execution by government forces over the course of 1981. However, the true figure for the number of persons killed by the Army and security services could be substantially higher, due to the fact that extrajudicial killings generally went unreported in the countryside and many of the victims' families remained silent in fear of reprisal. An ''Americas Watch'' report described that the ''Socorro Jurídico'' figures "tended to be conservative because its standards of confirmation are strict"; killings of persons were registered individually and required proof of being "not combat related".&lt;ref&gt;Americas Watch, ''US Reporting on Human Rights in El Salvador: Methodology At Odds With Knowledge'', New York, June 1982, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; ''Socorro Jurídico'' later revised its count of government killings for 1981 up to 16,000 with the induction of new cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USCIS,,SLV,,3dee03944,0.html|title=Refworld - El Salvador: Human Rights Violations by the National Police during the Initial Years of the Civil War|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|work=Refworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International.

Lieutenant Colonel Domingo Monterrosa 
Monterrosa chosen to replace Colonial Jaime Flores. He was a rare thing: "pure, one-hundred-percent  soldier, a natural leader, a born military man." The Massacre at el Mozote, Mark Danner, page 145 Monterrosa because the military commander of the whole eastern zone of El Salvador. Monterrosa did not want a whole bloodshed however, he wanted to win the war at any costs. this was his way of thinking after he changed his tactics. He tried to be more relatable to the local population and be less arrogant with the way in which he presented his military.when he first executed massacres he didn't think much of it because it was part of his military training and because it was tactically approved by the High Command, but he didn't think if it would become a political problem. People always said that he was responsible for what happened at El Mozote however, he denied it. Monterrosa later began to date a Salvadorian women who worked in the press corps, she worked for an American television network. Monterrosa's girlfriend let her co-worker know that something had gone wrong at El Mozote, for understandable and obvious reasons she could not and did not go into detail. But people knew that on that day he lost radio contact with his men and that it was unfortunate and something that later  brought regrettable consequences. Although he says he lost contact with his men, the guerrillas did not believe it and said he was well known for to evryone as the man who ordered the massacre. However, in an interview with James LeMoyne he told him that he did in fact order his men to "clean out" EL Mozote, he ordered the masacre at El Mozote.

==Interim government and continued violence: 1982–1984==
[[File:Jose Napoleon Duarte.png|right|thumb|[[José Napoleón Duarte]] at a Christian Democratic Party press conference during the Salvadoran war (1982)]]

===Peace offer and rejection===
In 1982, the FMLN began calling for a peace settlement that would establish a "government of broad participation". The Reagan administration said the FMLN wanted to create a Communist dictatorship.&lt;ref name="csmonitor.com"&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1986/1126/osalv3.html "Salvador rebels adapt to long war with new strategy. They focus on getting civilian support and exploiting Duarte's problems for political gains"] ''Christian Science Monitor'', November 26, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Elections were interrupted with right-wing paramilitary attacks and FMLN-suggested boycotts. El Salvador's National Federation of Lawyers, which represented all of the country's bar associations, refused to participate in drafting the 1982 electoral law. The lawyers said that the elections couldn't possibly be free and fair during a state of siege that suspended all basic rights and freedoms.

===FMLN steps up campaign===
Attacks against military and economic targets by the FMLN began to escalate. The FMLN attacked the [[Ilopango]] Air Force Base in San Salvador, destroying six of the Air Force's 14 [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois]] [[helicopter]]s, five of its 18 [[Dassault Ouragan]] aircraft and three [[C-47]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', 7 February 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Between February and April, a total of 439 acts of sabotage were reported.&lt;ref&gt;Centro Universitario de Documentación e Información, Proceso, Año 3, No. 98, February–April 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of acts of sabotage involving explosives or arson rose to 782 between January and September.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, Report of the Special Representative of the Commission on Human Rights, 1982, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Embassy estimated the damage to the economic infrastructure at US$98 million.&lt;ref&gt;United States Embassy in San Salvador (cable 02165), 3 March 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; FMLN also carried out large-scale operations in the capital city and temporarily occupied urban centres in the country's interior. According to some reports, the number of rebels ranged between 4,000 and 5,000; other sources put the number at between 6,000 and 9,000.&lt;ref&gt;United States Embassy in San Salvador (cable 00437), 3 December 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interim government===
Pursuant to measures implemented by the JRG junta on October 18, 1979, elections for an interim government were held on April 29, 1982. The [[Legislative Assembly of El Salvador|Legislative Assembly]] voted on three candidates nominated by the armed forces; [[Álvaro Alfredo Magaña Borja]], leader of the moderate Democratic Action and thus effectively politically independent, was elected by 36 votes to 17, ahead of the [[National Coalition Party (El Salvador)|Party of National Conciliation]] and the hard right [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]] (ARENA) candidates. Roberto D'Aubuisson accused Jaime Abdul Gutiérrez Avendaño of imposing on the Assembly "his personal decision to put Álvaro Alfredo Magaña Borja in the presidency" in spite of a "categorical no" from the ARENA deputies. Magana was sworn into office on 2 May.

Decree No. 6 of the National Assembly suspended phase III of the implementation of the agrarian reform, and was itself later amended. The Apaneca Pact was signed on 3 August 1982, establishing a Government of National Unity, whose objectives were peace, democratization, human rights, economic recovery, security and a strengthened international position. An attempt was made to form a transitional government which would establish a democratic system. Lack of agreement among the forces that made up the government and the pressures of the armed conflict prevented any substantive{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=July 2016}} changes from being made during Magaña's presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the UN Truth Commission on El Salvador|year=1993|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===More atrocities by the government===
The [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] reported that on May 24, 1982, a clandestine cemetery containing the corpses of 150 disappeared persons was discovered near Puerta del Diablo, [[Panchimalco]], approximately twelve kilometers from San Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;OAS-IACHR, Annual Report, 1981-1982, pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 10, 1982, almost 4,000 Salvadoran troops carried out a "cleanup" operation in the rebel-controlled [[Chalatenango Department|Chalatenango]] province. Over 600 civilians were reportedly massacred during the Army sweep. The Salvadoran field commander acknowledged that an unknown number of civilian rebel sympathizers or "masas" were killed, while declaring the operation a success.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/127428452.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+10%2C+1982&amp;author=By+Christopher+Dickey+Washington+Post+Foreign+Service&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%281974-Current+file%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A28&amp;desc=U.S.+Tactics+Fail+to+Prevent+Salvadoran+Civilian+Deaths "U.S. Tactics Fail to Prevent Salvadoran Civilian Deaths"] ''Washington Post'', June 10, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteen days later, the Army massacred 27 unarmed civilians during house raids in a San Salvador neighborhood. The women were raped and murdered. Everyone was dragged from their homes into the street and then executed. "The operation was a success," said the Salvadoran Defense Ministry communique. "This action was a result of training and professionalization of our officers and soldiers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1906&amp;dat=19820129&amp;id=C88fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BNkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1340,2087981 "Salvadoran Troops Massacre Civilians"] [[The Associated Press]], January 29, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1982 and 1983, government forces killed approximately 8,000 civilians a year.&lt;ref name="Stanley_1996"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stanley, William |title=''The Protection Racket State: Elite Politics, Military Extortion, and Civil War in El Salvador'' |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Temple University Press |date=1996 |isbn=1566393922}} [[Stanley William]], Professor at the [[University of New Mexico]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} Although the figure is substantially less than the figures reported by human rights groups in 1980 and 1981, targeted executions as well as indiscriminate killings nonetheless remained an integral policy of the army and internal security forces, part of what Professor William Stanley described as a "strategy of mass murder" designed to terrorize the civilian population as well as opponents of the government.&lt;ref name="Stanley_1996" /&gt;{{rp|225}} General Adolfo Blandón, the Salvadoran armed forces chief of staff during much of the 1980s, has stated, "Before 1983, we never took prisoners of war." &lt;ref&gt;Danner, Mark.

===Government murder of human rights and labor union leaders===
In March 1983, [[Marianella García Villas]], president of the Non-Governmental Human Rights Commission of El Salvador, was captured by army troops on the [[Guazapa (volcano)|Guazapa volcano]], and later tortured to death. Garcia Villas had been on Guazapa collecting evidence about the possible army use of white phosphorus munitions.

In April 1983, [[Ana María|Melida Anaya Montes]], a leader of the Popular Forces for Liberation (FPL) "Farabundo Marti", a communist party-affiliated militia, was murdered in [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]].  [[Salvador Cayetano Carpio]], her superior in the FPL was allegedly implicated in her murder.  He committed suicide in Managua shortly after Anaya Montes' murder.  Their deaths influenced the course within the FMLN of the FPL's Prolonged Popular War strategy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

On February 7, 1984, nine labor union leaders, including all seven top officials of one major labor federation, were arrested by the Salvadoran National Police and sent to be tried by a military court. The arrests were part of Duarte's moves to crack down on labor unions after more than 80 trade unionists were detained in a raid by the National Police. The police confiscated the union's files and took videotape mugshots of each union member.

During a 15-day interrogation, the nine labor leaders were beaten during late-night questioning and were told to confess to being guerrillas. They were then forced to sign a written confession while blindfolded. They were never charged with being guerrillas but the official police statement said they were accused of planning to "present demands to management for higher wages and benefits and promoting strikes, which destabilize the economy." A U.S. official said the embassy had "followed the arrests closely and was satisfied that the correct procedures were followed."&lt;ref name="Boston_Globe_1984"&gt;{{citation |title=9 Salvador Unionists Face Trial on Charges of Being Guerrillas |publisher=''Boston Globe'' |date=February 7, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fixed elections and lack of accountability===
In 1984 elections, Christian Democrat [[José Napoleón Duarte]] won the presidency (with 54% of the votes) against Army Major Roberto d'Aubuisson of the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]] (ARENA). The elections were held under military rule amidst high levels of repression and violence, however, and candidates to the left of Duarte's brand of Christian Democrats were excluded from participating.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3991805?uid=2129&amp;uid=3739600&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=55981266653 "Observing El Salvador: The 1984 Elections"] By PC Chitnis&lt;/ref&gt; Fearful of a d'Aubuisson presidency for public relations purposes, the CIA financed Duarte's campaign with some two million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1985/0125/osiege.html "Salvador's Duarte backs down on peace talks, further weakening his influence"] Christian Science Monitor, January 25, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

After Duarte's victory, human rights abuses at the hands of the army and security forces continued, but declined due to modifications made to the security structures. The policies of the Duarte government attempted to make the country's three security forces more accountable to the government by placing them under the direct supervision of a Vice Minister of Defense, but all three forces continued to be commanded individually by regular army officers, which, given the command structure within the government, served to effectively nullify any of the accountability provisions.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International. Amnesty International Report 1985 (London: AI, 1985), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New York Times. LeMoyne, James. "A Salvador Police Chief Vows an End to Abuses" (San Salvador: 1 July 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; The Duarte government also failed to decommission personnel within the security structures that had been involved in gross human rights abuses, instead simply dispersing them to posts in other regions of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International. Amnesty International's Current Concerns in El Salvador (London: AMR 29/09/85, June 1985), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Army continues massacres===
While reforms were being made to the security forces, the army continued to massacre unarmed civilians in the country side. An Americas Watch report noted that the [[Atlacatl Battalion]] killed 80 unarmed civilians in Cabanas in July, 1984 and carried out another massacre one month later, killing 50 displaced people in the Chalatenango province.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_c8umnadLwkC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;lpg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "A Year of Reckoning: El Salvador a Decade After the Assassination of Archbishop Romero"] Americas Watch, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The women were raped and then everyone was systematically executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1985/Salvadoran-Army-Accused-of-Massacres/id-5924b8120b6cd5f257031e1d348adb85 "Salvadoran Army Accused of Massacres"] Associated Press, Mar. 28, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ERP combatants Perquín 1990 14.jpg|thumb|left|ERP combatant Perquín 1990]]

Through 1984 and 1985, the Salvadoran Armed Forces enacted a series of "civic-action" programs in Chalatenango province. This consisted of the establishment of "citizen defense committees" to guard plantations and businesses against attacks by insurgents and the establishment of a number of [[free-fire zone]]s. These measures were implemented under former Cabanas commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sigifredo Ochoa Perez, who had previously been exiled to the US Army War College for mutiny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1984/0926/092640.html "Salvador colonel who mutinied is back in war"] Christian Science Monitor, September 26, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1985 Ochoa's forces had established 12 [[free-fire zone]]s in Chalatenango in which any inhabitants unidentified by the army were deemed to be insurgents. Ochoa stated in an interview that areas within the free fire zone were susceptible to indiscriminate bombings by the [[Salvadoran Air Force]]. Ochoa's forces were implicated in a massacre of about 40 civilians in an Army sweep through one of the free fire zones in August 1985. Ochoa refused to permit the Red Cross to enter these areas to deliver humanitarian aid to the victims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&amp;p_theme=dm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0ED3CD2DAC5CA78B&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "U.S.-backed strategy creates militias, free-fire zones"] Dallas Morning News, January 21, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Ochoa's forces reportedly uprooted some 1,400 civilian rebel supporters with mortar fire between September and November 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1985/0321/ochoa1.html "Salvador colonel runs province as a warlord"] Christian Science Monitor, March 21, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

In its annual review of 1987, Amnesty International reported that "some of the most serious violations of human rights are found in Central America," particularly Guatemala and El Salvador, where "kidnappings and assassinations serve as systematic mechanisms of the government against opposition from the left".&lt;ref&gt;"Central America Report", Inforpress Centroamericana, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; On 10/26/87, unknown gunmen shot and killed Herbert Ernesto Anaya, Director of El Salvador's nongovernmental Human Rights Commission. Anaya was in his car in his driveway with his wife and children at the time. Some human rights groups linked the increase of death squad-style killings and disappearances to the reactivation of the popular organizations, which had been decimated by mass state terror in the early 80s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1987/1027/osal.html "Salvador rights leader's murder seen tied to rise of death squads"] Christian Science Monitor, 10/27/87&lt;/ref&gt; Col. Renee Emilio Ponce, the Army operations chief, asserted that the guerrillas were "returning to their first phase of clandestine organization" in the city, "and mobilization of the masses".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1987/0715/ouniv.html "As discontent in El Salvador mounts, students spearhead militant opposition"] Christian Science Monitor, 07/15/87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace talks===
During the Central American Peace Accords negotiations in 1987, the FMLN demanded that all death squads be disbanded and the members be held accountable. In October 1987, the Salvadoran Assembly approved an amnesty for civil-war-related crimes. The Amnesty law required the release of all prisoners suspected of being guerrillas and guerrilla sympathizers. Pursuant to these laws, 400 political prisoners were released. Insurgents were given a period of fifteen days to turn themselves over to the security forces in exchange for amnesty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manuel|first=Anne|title=Nightmare Revisited, 1987-1988: Tenth Supplement to the Report on Human Rights in El Salvador|date=September 1988|publisher=Human Rights Watch|location=Background to the Deterioration|pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite amnesty being granted to guerillas and political prisoners, amnesty was also granted to members of the army, security forces and paramilitary who were involved in human rights abuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1987/1029/olaw.html "Salvadoreans attack amnesty law. They criticize new bill for absolving death squads"] Christian Science Monitor, October 29, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

===Army death squads continue===
In October 1988, Amnesty International reported that death squads had abducted, tortured, and killed, hundreds of suspected dissidents in the proceeding eighteen months. Most of the victims were trade unionists and members of cooperatives, human rights workers, members of the judiciary involved in efforts to establish criminal responsibility for human rights violations, returned refugees and displaced persons, and released political prisoners.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/El_Salvador.html?id=KlMPAAAAYAAJ "El Salvador: Death Squads, a Government Strategy"] Amnesty International, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The squads comprised intelligence sections of the Armed Forces and the security services. They customarily wore plain clothes and made use of trucks or vans with tinted windows and without license plates. They were "chillingly efficient", said the report. Victims were sometimes shot from passing cars, in the daytime and in front of eyewitnesses. At other times, victims were kidnapped from their homes or on the streets and their bodies found dumped far from the scene. Others were forcefully "disappeared." Victims were "customarily found mutilated, decapitated, dismembered, strangled or showing marks of torture or rape." The death squad style was "to operate in secret but to leave mutilated bodies of victims as a means of terrifying the population."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

===FMLN offensive of 1988 and retaliation===
Outraged by the results of the 1988 fixed elections and the military's use of terror tactics and voter intimidation, the [[FMLN]] launched a major [[Ofensiva hasta el tope|offensive]] with the aim of unseating the Cristiani government on November 11, 1989. This offensive brought the epicenter of fighting into the wealthy suburbs of San Salvador for essentially the first time in the history of the conflict, as the FMLN began a campaign of selective assassinations against political and military officials, civil officials, and upper-class private citizens.&lt;ref name="Hilsdon_2000"&gt;{{cite book|editors=Anne-Marie Hilsdon, M. Macintyre, V. Mackie, and M.

The government retaliated with a renewed campaign of repression, primarily against activists in the democratic sector.&lt;ref name="Hilsdon_2000"/&gt; The non-governmental Salvadoran Human Rights Commission (CDHES) counted 2,868 killings by the armed forces between May 1989 and May 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Central America Report 14 Sept. 1990, 277&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the CDHES stated that government paramilitary organizations illegally detained 1,916 persons and disappeared 250 during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Central America Report 31 Aug. 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 13, the Atlacatl Battalion attacked a guerrilla [[field hospital]] and killed at least 10 people, including five patients, a [[physician]] and a [[nurse]]. Two of the female victims showed signs that they had been raped before they were executed.

===US message===
Nearly two weeks earlier, [[US Vice President]] [[Dan Quayle]] on a visit to San Salvador told army leaders that human rights abuses committed by the military had to stop. Sources associated with the military said afterword that Quayle's warning was dismissed as propaganda for American consumption aimed at the US Congress and the U.S. public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-25/news/mn-212_1_rights-group "Salvador Raid on Rebel Hospital Charged: Rights Group Says 5 Patients Among 10 Dead; Atrocities Cited"] [[Los Angeles Times]], 25 February 1989&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, U.S. advisers were sending a different message to the Salvadoran military - "do what you need to do to stop the commies, just don't get caught".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unz.org/Pub/InTheseTimes-1989feb22-00012 "U.S. Salvador Policy"] In These Times, 02/22/89&lt;/ref&gt; A former U.S. intelligence officer suggested the death squads needed to leave less visual evidence, that they should stop dumping bodies on the side of the road because "they have an ocean and they ought to use it".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/03/neil-livingstone-montana-governor "The Most Interesting Gubernatorial Candidate in the World"] ''[[Mother Jones (Magazine)]]'', 03/27/12&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 29, 1989 press conference, [[Secretary of State]] [[James A. Baker]] III said he believed President Cristiani was in control of the army and defended the government's crackdown on opponents as "absolutely appropriate."&lt;ref name="chicagotribune_1989"&gt;{{citation |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1989/11/30/page/36/article/u-s-staffers-in-el-salvador-urged-to-leave-homes |title=U.S. staffers in El Salvador urged to leave homes |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=November 30, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Trade Representative]] told Human Rights Watch that the government's repression of trade unionists was justified on the grounds that they were guerrilla supporters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qKQ4SWETrB4C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s "Labor Rights in El Salvador"] Human Rights Watch, 01/01/88, pp. 98-100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times presented labor union wage demands as a challenge to the country and reported that ruling party politicians feared the resurgence of mass political organizations that had been destroyed by the government's violent repression. The National Federation of Trade Unions was "making tough wage demands," and Christian Democrats said they were "haunted by the memory of 1979, when the same groups were prominent in the near-anarchy that swept El Salvador." But "by mid-1980, the agitation dried up as many street activists joined the guerrillas and others disengaged out of fear for their lives, while the Government imposed the wage freeze and state of siege" amidst "accusations" of human rights abuses. The fear they said was that these subversive groups, who admitted their former affiliation with the political arm of the guerrillas, may try to reestablish the "mass organizations" that were destroyed by the violent repression of strikes and demonstrations in the early 1980s.

===Government terrorism in San Salvador===
In San Salvador on October 1, 1989, eight people were killed and 35 others were injured when a death squad bombed the headquarters of the leftist labor confederation, the National Trade Union Federation of Salvadoran Workers (UNTS).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/01/world/bombing-at-salvadoran-leftists-office-kills-eight.html "Bombing at Salvadoran Leftists' Office Kills Eight"] New York Times, 1 Nov. 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier the same day, another bomb exploded outside the headquarters of a victims' advocacy group, the Committee of Mothers and Family Members of Political Prisoners, Disappeared and Assassinated of El Salvador, injuring four others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/01/world/bombing-at-salvadoran-leftists-office-kills-eight.html "Bombing at Salvadoran Leftists' Office Kills Eight"] New York Times, 11/01/89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death squads take on the church===
As in the early 1980s, the University of Central America fell under attack from the army and death squads. On 16 November 1989, five days after the beginning of the FMLN offensive, uniformed soldiers of the [[Atlacatl Battalion]] entered the campus of the [[University of Central America]] in the middle of the night and [[Murder of UCA scholars|executed six Jesuit priests]]—[[Ignacio Ellacuría]], [[Segundo Montes]], [[Ignacio Martín-Baró]], Joaquín López y López, Juan Ramón Moreno, and Amando López—and their housekeepers (a mother and daughter, Elba Ramos and Celia Marisela Ramos). The priests were dragged from their beds on the campus, machine gunned to death and their corpses mutilated. The mother and daughter were found shot to death in the bed they shared.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/17/world/6-priests-killed-in-a-campus-raid-in-san-salvador.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm "6 PRIESTS KILLED IN A CAMPUS RAID IN SAN SALVADOR"] ''New York Times'', November 17, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The Atlacatl Battalion was reportedly under the tutelage of U.S. special forces just 48 hours before the killings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/13/weekinreview/salvadoran-justice-wears-out-patience.html "Salvadoran Justice Wears Out Patience"] ''The New York Times'', May 13, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; One day later, six men and one youth were slaughtered by government soldiers in the capital, San Salvador. According to relatives and neighbors who witnessed the killings, the six men were lined up against a masonry wall and shot to death. The seventh youth who happened to be walking by at the time was also executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Second-Salvador-Massacre-But-of-Common-Folk/id-baabc031d8bb800b888bf3487664e4ee "Second Salvador Massacre, But of Common Folk"] Associated Press, 11/28/89&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salvadoran government then began a campaign to dismantle a liberal [[Catholic church]] network that the army said were "front organizations" supporting the guerrillas. Church offices were raided and workers were arrested and expelled. Targets included priests, lay workers and foreign employees of humanitarian agencies, providing social services to the poor: food programs, [[healthcare]], relief for the displaced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-12-13/news/mn-104_1_church-network "Salvador Seeks to Quell Liberal Church Network"] L.A.

===Pressures to end stalemate===
The murder of the six Jesuit priests and the November 1989 'final offensive' by the FMLN in San Salvador, however, were key turning points that increased international pressure and domestic pressure from war-weary constituents that alternatives to the military stalemate needed to be found.  International support for the FMLN was declining with the end of the Cold War just as international support for the Salvadoran armed forces was weakening as the Reagan administration gave way to the less ideological Bush administration, and the end of the Cold War lessened the anti-Communist concerns about a potential domino effect in Central America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Jeffrey|date=January 2009|title=The Structure of Negotiation: Lessons from El Salvador for Contemporary Conflict Resolution|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229930205_The_Structure_of_Negotiation_Lessons_from_El_Salvador_for_Contemporary_Conflict_Resolution|journal=Negotiation Journal|volume=25 |issue=1|pages=83–105|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 10 years of war, more than one million people had been displaced out of a population of 5,389,000. 40% of the homes of newly displaced people were completely destroyed and another 25% were in need of major repairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1990/0322/echel.html "Central America's Health Plight"] Christian Science Monitor, March 22, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Death squad activities further escalated in 1990, despite a U.N.

President Bush authorized the release of $42.5 million in military aid to the Salvadoran armed forces on January 16, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-16/news/mn-346_1_el-salvador "Bush to Free El Salvador Military Aid"] Associated Press, January 16, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In late January, the Usulután offices of the Democratic Convergence, a coalition of left-of-center parties, were attacked with grenades. On February 21, a candidate for the Democratic National Unity (UDN) party and his pregnant wife were assassinated after ignoring death squad threats to leave the country or die. On the last day of the campaign, another UDN candidate was shot in her eye when Arena party gunmen opened fire on campaign activists putting up posters. Despite fraudulent elections orchestrated by Arena through voter intimidation, sabotage of polling stations by the Arena-dominated Central Elections Council and the disappearing of tens of thousands of names from the voting lists, the official U.S. observation team declared them "free and fair."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unz.org/Pub/InTheseTimes-1991apr03-00009 "Rightist intimidation wins in El Salvador"] In In These Times, April 3, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Death squad killings and disappearances remained steady throughout 1991 as well as torture, false imprisonment, and attacks on civilians by the Army and security forces. Opposition politician, members of church and grassroots organizations representing peasants, women and repatriated refugees suffered constant death threats, arrests, surveillance and break-ins all year.  The FMLN killed two wounded U.S. military advisers and carried out indiscriminate attacks, kidnappings and assassinations of civilians. The war intensified in mid-1991, as both the army and the FMLN attempted to gain the advantage in the United Nations-brokered peace talks prior to a cease-fire. Indiscriminate attacks and executions by the armed forces increased as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,HRW,,SLV,4562d94e2,467fca47c,0.html "Human Rights Watch World Report 1992 - El Salvador"] Human Rights Watch, 1 January 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
Eventually, by April 1991, negotiations resumed, resulting in a truce that successfully concluded in January 1992, bringing about the war's end.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} On 16 January 1992, the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]] were signed in [[Chapultepec Castle]], Mexico City, to bring peace to El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.promotingpeace.org/1985/1/roush.html|title=PEACE in Action - Peacemaking and Conflict Resolution|work=promotingpeace.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Armed Forces were regulated, a civilian police force was established, the FMLN metamorphosed from a guerrilla army to a political party, and an [[amnesty law]] was legislated in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37088 Amnesty Law Biggest Obstacle to Human Rights, Say Activists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205045538/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37088 |date=2012-02-05 }} by Raúl Gutiérrez, [[Inter Press Service News Agency]], May 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The peace process set up under the Chapultepec Accords was monitored by the United Nations from 1991 until June 1997 when it closed its special monitoring mission in El Salvador.

During the 2004 elections, White House Special Assistant [[Otto Reich]] gave a phone-in press conference at ARENA party headquarters. He reportedly said he was worried about the impact an FMLN win could have on the country's "economic, commercial, and migratory relations with the United States." In February 2004, Assistant Secretary of State [[Roger Noriega]] told voters to "consider what kind of a relationship they want a new administration to have with us." He met with all the candidates except Schafik Handal, the FMLN candidate. This prompted 28 US Congress members to send a letter to Secretary of State Colin Powell saying Mr. Noriega "crossed a boundary" and that his remarks were perceived as "interference in Salvadoran electoral affairs." A week later, two US congressmen blasted Reich's comments as inflammatory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0319/p07s02-woam.html "El Salvador vote recalls cold-war power play"] The Christian Science Monitor, March 19, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Truth Commission===
{{Main|Truth Commission for El Salvador}}
At war's end, the Commission on the Truth for El Salvador registered more than 22,000 complaints of political violence in El Salvador, between January 1980 and July 1991, 60 percent about summary killing, 25 percent about kidnapping, and 20 percent about torture. These complaints attributed almost 85 percent of the violence to the [[Salvadoran Army]] and security forces alone. The [[Salvadoran Armed Forces]], which were massively supported by the United States ($5,339,864,000.00 in 2018 dollars),&lt;ref name="monde-diplomatique_2009"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/carnet/2009-03-19-Salvador |title=El Salvador : des guérilleros au pouvoir |author=Maurice Lemoine |date=March 19, 2009 |accessdate=January 22, 2017 |publisher=
[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; were accused in 60 percent of the complaints, the security forces (i.e. the [[National Guard (El Salvador)|National Guard]], Treasury Police and the National Police) in 25 percent, military escorts and civil defense units in 20 percent of complaints, the death squads in approximately 10 percent, and the FMLN in 5 percent.&lt;ref name="monde-diplomatique_2009" /&gt; The Truth Commission could collect only a significant sample of the full number of potential complaints, having had only three months to collect it.&lt;ref name="Truth_Commission_2001"&gt;{{cite report |editor=[[Belisario Betancur]] |url=http://www.usip.org/files/file/ElSalvador-Report.pdf |format=PDF |title=From madness to hope: the 12-year war in El Salvador Part IV.

More than 25 per cent of the populace was displaced as refugees before the U.N. peace treaty in 1992.&lt;ref name="decade-107"&gt;''El Salvador's Decade of Terror,'' 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1891145.stm "U.S. role in Salvador's brutal war,"] BBC News, March 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The statistics presented in the Truth Commission's report are consistent with both previous and retrospective assessments by the international community and human rights monitors, which documented that the majority of the violence and repression in El Salvador was attributable to government agencies, primarily the [[National Guard (El Salvador)|National Guard]] and the [[Salvadoran Army]].&lt;ref name="decade"&gt;''El Salvador's decade of terror'', Americas Watch, Human Rights Watch Books, Yale University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''El Salvador: 'Death Squads'—A Government Strategy.''

Despite mostly killing peasants, the Government readily killed any opponent they suspected of sympathy with the guerrillas—clergy (men and women), church lay workers, political activists, journalists, labor unionists (leaders, rank-and-file), medical workers, liberal students and teachers, and human-rights monitors.&lt;ref name="decade-vii"&gt;''El Salvador's decade of terror'', vii.&lt;/ref&gt; The State's terrorism was affected by the security forces, the Army, the National Guard, and the Treasury Police;&lt;ref name="McClintock_1985"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael McClintock |title=''The American connection: state terror and popular resistance in El Salvador'' |publisher=Zed Books |location=London|pages=388 |isbn=0862322405 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_American_Connection_State_terror_and.html?id=QO5qAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|308}}&lt;ref&gt;''El Salvador's decade of terror'', 47.&lt;/ref&gt; yet it was the paramilitary [[death squads]] who gave the Government plausible deniability of, and accountability for, the political killings. Typically, a death squad dressed in civilian clothes and traveled in anonymous vehicles (dark windows, blank license plates). Their terrorism consisted of publishing future-victim death lists, delivering coffins to said future victims, and sending the target-person an invitation to his/her own funeral.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Gus. ''Understanding terrorism: challenges, perspectives and issues'', Sage Publications, 2003, 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="decade-21"&gt;''El Salvador's decade of terror'', 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Cynthia Arnson, a Latin American-affairs writer for Human Rights Watch, says: ''the objective of death-squad-terror seemed not only to eliminate opponents, but also, through torture and the gruesome disfigurement of bodies, to terrorize the population''.&lt;ref name="arnson"&gt;Arnson, Cynthia J. "Window on the past: a declassified history of death squads in El Salvador," in ''Death squads in global perspective: murder with deniability'', Campbell and Brenner, eds., 86.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1980s, state terror against Salvadorans became open—indiscriminate bombing from military airplanes, planted mines, and the harassment of national and international medical personnel; ''all indicate that, although death rates attributable to the death squads have declined in El Salvador since 1983, non-combatant victims of the civil war have increased dramatically''.&lt;ref name="lopez"&gt;Lopez, George A. "Terrorism in Latin America," in ''The politics of terrorism'', Michael Stohl, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the violations of the FMLN accounted for five percent or less of those documented by the Truth Commission, the FMLN continuously violated the human rights of many Salvadorans and other individuals identified as right-wing supporters, military targets, pro-government politicians, intellectuals, public officials, and judges. These violations included kidnapping, bombings, rape, and killing.&lt;ref name="Truth_Commission_2001" /&gt;

===Military reform===
In accordance with the peace agreements, the constitution was amended to prohibit the military from playing an internal security role except under extraordinary circumstances. During the period of fulfilling of the peace agreements, the Minister of Defense was General Humberto Corado Figueroa. Demobilization of Salvadoran military forces generally proceeded on schedule throughout the process. The Treasury Police and National Guard were abolished, and military intelligence functions were transferred to civilian control. By 1993—nine months ahead of schedule—the military had cut personnel from a wartime high of 63,000 to the level of 32,000 required by the peace accords. By 1999, ESAF's strength stood at less than 15,000, including uniformed and non-uniformed personnel, consisting of personnel in the army, navy, and air force. A purge of military officers accused of human rights abuses and corruption was completed in 1993 in compliance with the Ad Hoc Committee's recommendations.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===National Civilian Police===
The new civilian police force, created to replace the discredited public security forces, deployed its first officers in March 1993, and was present throughout the country by the end of 1994. In 1999, the PNC had over 18,000 officers. The PNC faced many challenges in building a completely new police force. With common crime rising dramatically since the end of the war, over 500 PNC officers had been killed in the line of duty by late 1998. PNC officers also have arrested a number of their own in connection with various high-profile crimes, and a "purification" process to weed out unfit personnel from throughout the force was undertaken in late 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2033.htm|title=El Salvador|work=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human Rights Commission of El Salvador==
On 26 October 1987, [[Herbert Ernesto Anaya]], head of the CDHES, was assassinated. His killing provoked four days' of political protest—during which his [[cadaver]] was displayed before the U.S. embassy and then before the Salvadoran armed forces headquarters. The National Union of Salvadoran Workers said: "Those who bear sole responsibility for this crime are José Napoleón Duarte, the U.S. embassy...and the high command of the armed forces".  In its report the Commission on the Truth for El Salvador, established as part of the El Salvador peace agreement, stated that it could not establish for sure whether the death squads, the Salvadoran Army or the FMLN was responsible for Anaya's death.

Moreover, the FMLN and the [[Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (FDR) also protested Mr. Anaya's assassination by suspending negotiations with the Duarte government on 29 October 1987. The same day, Reni Roldán resigned from the Commission of National Reconciliation, saying: "The murder of Anaya, the disappearance of university labor leader Salvador Ubau, and other events do not seem to be isolated incidents. They are all part of an institutionalized pattern of conduct". Mr. Anaya's assassination evoked international indignation: the West German government, the [[West German Social Democratic Party]], and the [[Cohabitation (government)|French government]] asked President Duarte to clarify the circumstances of the crime. United Nations Secretary General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, [[Americas Watch]], [[Amnesty International]], and other organizations protested against the assassination of the leader of the Human Rights Commission of El Salvador.&lt;ref name="JG"&gt;Jose Gutierrez: [http://www.greenleft.org.au/1993/95/4265 "The Killing of Herbert Anaya Sanabria"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930031531/http://www.greenleft.org.au/1993/95/4265 |date=2007-09-30 }} Green Left Online, 7 April 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war international litigation==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
Groups seeking investigation or retribution for actions during the war have sought the involvement of other foreign courts. In 2008 the Spanish Association for Human Rights and a California organization called the [[Center for Justice and Accountability]] jointly filed a lawsuit in [[Spain]] against former President Cristiani and former defense minister Larios in the matter of the 1989 slaying of several Jesuit priests, their housekeeper, and her daughter. The lawsuit accused Cristiani of a cover-up of the killings and Larios of participating in the meeting where the order to kill them was given; the groups asked the Spanish court to intervene on the principle of [[universal jurisdiction]] for [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref name="woolls"&gt;Daniel Woolls, Associated Press. [https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081113/ap_on_re_eu/eu_spain_salvador_massacre_1 "El Salvador massacre case filed in Spanish court,"] November 13, 2008. Retrieved 2008-11-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Long after the war, in a U.S. federal court, in the case of ''Ford vs. García'' the families of the murdered Maryknoll nuns sued the two Salvadoran generals believed responsible for the killings, but lost; the jury found Gen. [[Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova]], ex-National Guard Leader and Duarte's defense minister, and Gen. [[José Guillermo Garcia]]—defense minister from 1979 to 1984, not responsible for the killings; the families appealed and lost, and, in 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear their final appeal. A second case, against the same generals, succeeded in the same Federal Court; the three plaintiffs in ''Romagoza vs. García'' won a judgment exceeding US$54 million compensation for having been tortured by the military during El Salvador's Civil War.

The day after losing a court appeal in October 2009, the two generals were put into deportation proceedings by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), at the urging of U.S. Senators Richard Durbin (Democrat) and Tom Coburn (Republican), according to the Center for Justice and Accountability (CJA). Those deportation proceedings had been stalled by May 2010. However; one of the plaintiffs in the case believes the U.S. CIA/DOD—protecting its "[[asset (intelligence)|assets]]" — has stymied the Obama Justice Department, for now.

The Spanish judge who issued indictments and arrest warrants for 20 former members of the Salvadoran military, charged with murder, Crimes Against Humanity and Terrorism requested that U.S. agencies declassify documents related to the killings of the Jesuits, their housekeeper and her daughter but were denied access. In his report, Judge Velasco writes:

"The agencies in charge of making the information public have identified 3,000 other documents that remain secret and are not available; the reasoning given is that privacy is needed to protect sources and methods. Many of the documents, from the CIA and the Defense Department, are not available…"&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsarchive.wordpress.com/2009/11/16/right-to-justice-in-el-salvador/ "The Right to Information is the Right to Justice: Declassified Documents and the Assassination of the Jesuits in El Salvador"] The National Security Archive, November 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Shigeaki Mori'''|森 重昭|Mori Shigeaki|born 29 March 1937}} is a Japanese historian living in [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]]. He is known for his research into [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] who died during the [[air raids on Japan]]. His hug with U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] during the president's visit to Hiroshima gained world-wide attention.

==World War II==
Mori was a young boy in Hiroshima during [[World War II]]. When the city was [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|destroyed with an atomic bomb]] on August 6, 1945, he was walking on a bridge and was thrown into a river. He saw a large number of badly wounded people that he was unable to help.&lt;ref name="setting"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|title=‘I still hate the glow of the setting sun': Hiroshima survivors’ tales|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/05/27/national/still-hate-glow-setting-sun-hiroshima-survivors-tales/|publisher=''[[Japan Times]]''|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postwar research==
[[file:Site of Former Chugoku Military Police Headquaters.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Plaque to commemorate American soldiers
killed by the atomic bomb.]]
An [[hibakusha|atomic bomb survivor]], Mori has spent over 30 years researching and obtaining official recognition for United States [[aviator]]s who were killed while being held as [[POW]]s in the Chugoku Military Police Headquarters, approximately 400m from the explosion's [[hypocenter]] in Hiroshima.  He authored a book on the subject: ''A Secret History of U.S. Servicemembers Who Died in Atomic Bomb''.&lt;ref name="原爆で死んだ米兵秘史"&gt;{{cite book|last=森|first=重昭|title=原爆で死んだ米兵秘史|year=2008|publisher=光人社|location=Japan|isbn=978-4-7698-1399-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, Mori has been trying to locate relatives of airmen from one of the aircraft shot down during an [[Bombing of Kure (July 1945)|air raid on Kure]], from the [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24J bomber]] "Taloa." Wreckage from the downed aircraft that had been hidden by local farmers was handed over to Mori with the hope of being returned to surviving family members for closure.&lt;ref name="Stars and Stripes Report"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sumida|first=Chiyomi|title=Hiroshima historian returns fragments of shot-down bomber to loved ones in U.S.|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/hiroshima-historian-returns-fragments-of-shot-down-bomber-to-loved-ones-in-u-s-1.85323|publisher=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|''Stars and Stripes'']]|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mori met and was embraced by US President [[Barack Obama]] during Obama's May 2016 visit to Hiroshima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kevin Liptak and James Griffiths|title=Obama in Hiroshima calls for 'world without nuclear weapons'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/27/politics/obama-hiroshima-japan/index.html|website=[[CNN]]|accessdate=30 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Syrian Resistance''' (''Al Muqāwamat al-Sūriyah'', [[Arabic]]: المقاومة السورية), formerly known as the '''Popular Front for the Liberation of the Sanjak of Iskandarun''' ([[Arabic]]: الجبهة الشعبية لتحرير لواء اســكندرون), is a pro-government Syrian armed [[militia]] group operating in northwest Syria, claiming a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] ideology.

== Background ==
The movement is led by [[Mihrac Ural]], a [[Alawites in Turkey|Turkish Alawite]] who has Syrian citizenship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-315474-mihrac-ural-a-man-with-a-long-history-of-terrorism.html |title=Mihraç Ural, a man with a long history of terrorism |publisher=Todayszaman.com |date=14 May 2013 |accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also known as "Ali Kayyali" (علي كيالي).&lt;ref name="ProAssadSyrianResistance"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alquds.co.uk/?p=509435|title=مصادر أمنية تركية تؤكد مقتل معراج أورال في ريف اللاذقية|author=far|work=القدس العربي Alquds Newspaper|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Today's Zaman]]'', Ural was the leader of a clandestine insurgent cell in [[Hatay Province]] called the Turkish Peoples' Liberation Party-Front ''Acilciler'' ("The Urgent Ones"). ''Zaman'' further alleged that Ural's group has sought to agitate Hatay's sizable Alawite population into confrontation with the Turkish authorities and has also recruited local Alawites to fight in Syria on behalf of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-291247-group-tries-to-recruit-hatay-alevis-into-assad-army.html|title=Group tries to recruit Hatay Alevis into Assad army|date=3 September 2012|publisher=Today's Zaman|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group does however claim to also have supporters among Syria's Sunni Muslims and Christians.&lt;ref name="ProAssadSyrianResistance"/&gt;

Though the group openly espouses a broadly-inclusive platform of Syrian nationalism in addition to secular leftism, it has been claimed that its primary focus is the defence of the [[Alawites|Alawite]] and [[Twelver|Twelver Shi’a]] religious minorities of Syria.&lt;ref name="ProAssadSyrianResistance"&gt;{{cite web|last=al-Tamimi|first=Aymenn Jawad|title=A Case Study of "The Syrian Resistance," a Pro-Assad Militia Force|url=http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/aymenn-al-tamimi-speaks-to-ali-kayali-and-profiles-the-syrian-resistance-a-pro-assad-militia-force/|work=Syria Comment|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Syrian Resistance has been accused by the [[Syrian opposition]] of being a [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] Alawite [[militia]], and of having carried out bombings and attacks in [[Turkey]] and on villages in Syria. However, Sheikh Muwaffaq al-Ghazal, a member of the Islamic Alawi Council, claims it has an inclusive national line regarding religion, race and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/15770|title=Syria: Secularism Takes a Backseat in Latakia |publisher=Al Akhbar English |date=11 May 2013|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founded before the [[Syrian Civil War]]'s outbreak under the name "Popular Front for the Liberation of the Sanjak of Iskandarun", the militia has been most active in [[Latakia Governorate]],&lt;ref name="ProAssadSyrianResistance"/&gt; where its members reportedly [[Bayda and Baniyas massacres|committed a massacre]] in the town of [[Baniyas]] in 2013. The Turkish government has also suscepted the Syrian Resistance for carrying out the [[Reyhanlı bombings]].&lt;ref name="butcher"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syrianobserver.com/EN/News/33794/Turkey_Furious_Over_Attendance_Butcher_Baniyas_at_Sochi |title=Turkey Furious Over Attendance of 'Butcher of Baniyas' at Sochi |author=Alsouria Net |work=The Syrian Observer |date=2 February 2018 |accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 2016, it was falsely reported&lt;ref name="butcher"/&gt; that Mihraç Ural had been killed by [[Ahrar al-Sham]].&lt;ref name="sabah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysabah.com/nation/2016/03/29/mihrac-ural-top-terrorist-sought-by-turkey-fighting-in-assad-regime-ranks-killed-in-clashes-in-syria|title=Mihraç Ural, top terrorist sought by Turkey fighting in Assad regime ranks, killed in clashes in Syria|date=29 March 2016|work=DailySabah|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zaman"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.zamanalwsl.net/news/14975.html|title=Death of Mihrac Ural not yet confirmed: militia, regime SYRIA NEWS - ZAMAN ALWSL|work=SYRIA NEWS - ZAMAN ALWSL|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late July 2016, the Syrian Resistance sent reinforcement contingents from [[Hama]] to Aleppo in order to support the pro-government forces during the [[2016 Aleppo campaign]]. In course of the campaign, they were deployed both in the northern city at the Castello road front, as well as in the south where rebel forces launched a [[Aleppo offensive (July–August 2016)|counter-offensive]].&lt;ref name="askari" /&gt;

At some point, the "Falcons of the Jazira and Euphrates", a militia of [[Deir ez-Zor Governorate]] natives, officially joined the Syrian Resistance, though it remained operationally fully autonomous. Under the Syrian Resistance's flag, this unit took part in the [[central Syria campaign (July 2017–present)|central Syria campaign]] of mid-2017.&lt;ref name="Furat" /&gt;

Jamal Trabelsi, director of the Syrian Resistance's information office, was targeted by an [[improvised explosive device]] (IED) in Aleppo in July 2017, though he survived. The group accused "Turkey-backed &amp; hired gangs" of being behind the attack.&lt;ref name="Trabelsi"/&gt; A few days later, a female media officer of the Syrian Resistance, Duaa Hayel Sulaiman, was assassinated in [[Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aldorars.com/en/news/825 |title=Media woman Killed under mysterious circumstances |work=Al-Dorar Al-Shamia|author=|date=26 July 2017|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7488">The '''Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts''' consists of more than 22,000 pamphlets, broadsides, manuscripts, books, and news sheets, most of which were printed and distributed in [[London]] from 1640 to 1661. The collection represents a major [[primary source]] for the political, religious, military, and [[social history of England]] during the final years of the reign of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], the [[English Civil War]], the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]], and the [[English Restoration]] of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]. It is now held in the [[British Library]].

== Compilation of the collection ==
Bookseller and publisher [[George Thomason]] (died 1666), who maintained a shop in the churchyard of [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] in London, methodically collected and preserved the works over two decades. The tracts consist of a broad range of writings, including sermons, songs, political speeches, debates, opinions, jokes, gossip, news reports, descriptions of the trial and execution of Charles I, accounts of Civil War battles, reports from Parliament, and several regularly appearing publications that historians consider the forebears of modern newspapers. Thomason's collection represents approximately 80 percent of the published works released in England during this period.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=868}}{{sfn|Gillies|2013}}

Thomason frequently made handwritten annotations on the tracts, providing such information as publication dates and the authorship of anonymous works. During the turbulent years of the Civil War and [[the Protectorate]] of [[Oliver Cromwell]] Thomason reputedly moved the collection several times to protect the more controversial works from destruction by government or opposition censors.{{sfn|Gillies|2013}}

== History of the collection ==
Thomason appears to have entrusted the collection to the care of [[Thomas Barlow (bishop)|Thomas Barlow]], provost of [[The Queen's College, Oxford|The Queen's College]] and former librarian of the [[Bodleian Library]] at the [[University of Oxford]], and a future [[Bishop of Lincoln]]. Between 1660 and 1664 Barlow offered the tracts, together with two copies of a manuscript catalogue to the university for £4,000 but the sale was not agreed. Thomason remained hopeful that they would be sold, and in his will dated 1664, he charged his three executors (Barlow, Thomas Lockey, and [[John Rushworth]]) with selling the collection to the University on behalf of his children.

After Thomason's death in April 1666, the negotiations fell through and the collection remained in Barlow's hands, until they were acquired about 1677–1679 by the bookbinder [[Samuel Mearne]] on behalf of the Royal Library at the [[Palace of Whitehall]]. Mearne rebound the tract volumes in a uniform manner but was never paid for his work and so retained the collection. Eventually Mearne's widow sought and obtained the permission of the [[Privy Council]] in May 1684 to dispose of them on her family's behalf. Over the next four decades various members of the Sisson family (descendants of Samuel Mearne) endeavoured to sell the collection on numerous occasions to [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer]], the [[Bodleian Library]], [[Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth]], [[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos]], [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]], the [[Radcliffe Library]] in Oxford and the antiquary and book collector [["Honest Tom" Martin]], but in each case the potential purchasers were put off by the high price asked.

In January 1754 Elizabeth Sisson approached [[Thomas Birch]] one of the trustees of the newly established [[British Museum]], loaning him the 12 volume catalogue, but again nothing was to come of the sale during Elizabeth Sisson's lifetime. Finally, in 1762, [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute]] purchased the collection on behalf of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] for the bargain price of £300 (a fraction of the cost of forming the collection). In that same year [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] donated the collection to the new [[British Museum]] at [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], where they were originally known as the "King's pamphlets" and added to the Royal Library Collection. In 1973, the museum transferred the Thomason Tracts to the British Library where they continue to be housed.{{sfn|Gillies|2013}}

==Significance of the collection ==
According to [[Thomas Carlyle]], the Thomason Tracts were;
{{quote|
the most valuable set of documents connected with English history; greatly preferable to all the sheepskins in the Tower and other places, for informing the English what the English were in former times; I believe the whole secret of the seventeenth century is involved in that hideous mass of rubbish there (Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the constitution and government of the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stoker|1992}} cites ''Report of the Commissioners appointed to inquire into the constitution and government of the British Museum'', (London, 1850), p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== The Thomason Tracts today ==
Many of the publications that comprise the collection are exceedingly rare. In fact, some are not known to exist anywhere else. The tracts are bound into some 2,000 volumes and housed at the British Library's main building at [[St Pancras, London|St. Pancras]]. Because of their rarity and fragile condition, the originals are not available to general researchers. However, the library maintains paper facsimiles in its rare books collection, and in 1977 University Microfilms International released a set of 256 [[microfilm]] reels containing the entire collection. The microfilms are available at research libraries around the world.&lt;ref&gt;The Library of Congress, "[https://www.loc.gov/rr/microform/brit_govt.html British Government Documents in the Microform Reading Room]."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tomás de Zumalacárregui e Imaz, 1st Duke of the Victory of the Amezcoas, 1st Count of Zumalacárregui''', [[Grandee|GE]], [[Royal and Military Order of Saint Hermenegild|OSH]] ([[Basque language|Basque]]: '''Tomas Zumalakarregi Imatz'''; 29 December 1788{{snd}}24 June 1835), known among his troops as "Uncle Tomás", was a [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[Basques|Basque]] officer who lead the [[Carlism|Carlist]] faction as [[Captain general of the Army]] during the [[First Carlist War]]. He was ocassionaly nicknamed the "Wolf of the Amezcoas", making reference to his famous military victory in said region of [[Navarre]].

Zumalacárregui is often credited as the inventor of [[Spanish omelette]] (or "tortilla de patatas"), which he elaborated during the Siege of [[Bilbao]], as a simple, fast and nutritious dish with which to satisfy the hardships of the [[Carlism|Carlist Army]]. In search of nourishment, he came across a poor [[Housewife|housewife]] who had nothing other than [[Egg as food|eggs]], [[Onion|onion]] and [[Potato|potatoes]]. When Zumalacárregui mixed it up, he liked the end result and fed it to his starving troops. It is said that after this, the tortilla became incredibly popular throughout the rest of the [[First Carlist War]], and is now one of the most renowned dishes in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Jack, Albert (2010).

==From the Peninsula War to Ferdinand VII==
Zumalacárregui was born in [[Ormaiztegi]] in [[Gipuzkoa]], a Basque province in Spain, on 29 December 1788. His father, Francisco Antonio de Zumalacárregui, was a lawyer who possessed some property, and the son was articled to a solicitor.

[[File:Zumalakarregi_museoa.jpg|thumb|left|Zumalacárregui's birthplace-turned-museum in [[Ormaiztegi]]]]

When the Peninsular War began with a French invasion of Spain in 1808 he enlisted in [[Zaragoza]]. He served in the 1808 [[First Siege of Zaragoza]], at the [[Battle of Tudela]], and during the 1809 [[Second Siege of Zaragoza]] until he was taken prisoner in a sortie. He succeeded in escaping and in reaching his family in [[Navarre]]. For a short time he served with Gaspar de Jáuregui, another Gipuzkoan known as "The Shepherd" ({{lang-eu|Artzaia}}), one of the minor [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] leaders.

But Zumalacárregui, who was noted for his grave and silent disposition and his strong religious principles, disliked the disorderly life of the guerrillas, and when regular forces were organized in the north he entered the 1st battalion of Gipuzkoa as an officer. During the remainder of the war he served in the regular army. In 1812, his brother [[Miguel Antonio de Zumalacárregui]] was present in Cádiz at the moment, going on to be elected chief deputy of Gipuzkoa. Tomas was then sent with dispatches to the Regency at [[Cádiz]], and received his commission as captain. In that rank he was present at the [[battle of San Marcial]] foist of August 1813. After the restoration of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] he continued in the army, and is said to have made a careful study of the theory of war.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Zumalacárregui, Thomas|volume=28|pages=1055-1056|first=David|last=Hannay|authorlink=David Hannay (historian)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== During Ferdinand VII's rule ==
[[Image:Zumalacarregui portrait.png|thumb|160px|right|Posthumous portrait of Zumalacárregui dressed in uniform of [[Captain general of the Army|Captain general of the Carlist Army]], 1845]]
Zumalacárregui had no sympathy with the liberal principles which were spreading in Spain, and became noted as what was called a ''servil'' or strong Royalist. He attracted no attention at headquarters, and was still a captain when the Revolution of 1820 broke out and the [[Trienio Liberal]] was established. His brother officers, whose leanings were liberal, denounced him to the revolutionary government, and asked that he might be removed. The recommendation was not acted on, but Zumalacárregui knew of it, and laid up the offence in his mind. Finding that he was suspected (probably with truth) of an intention to bring the soldiers over to the royalist side, he escaped to [[France]].

In 1823 he returned as an officer in one of the royalist regiments which had been organized on French soil by the consent of the government. He was now known as a thoroughly trustworthy servant of the royalty, but he was too proud to be a [[courtier]]. For some years he was employed in bringing regiments which the government distrusted to order. He became lieutenant-colonel in 1825 and colonel in 1829. In 1832 he was named military governor of [[Ferrol, Galicia]]. Before [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]] died in 1833, Zumalacárregui was marked out as a natural supporter of the traditionalist party, which favoured the king's brother, [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

== The Carlist War ==
The proclamation of the king's daughter [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel]] as heiress was almost the occasion of an armed conflict between him and the naval authorities at Ferrol, who were partisans of the liberal and so-called "constitutional" cause. He was put on half pay by the new authorities and ordered to live under police observation at [[Pamplona]] in Navarre.

When the [[First Carlist War|Carlist uprising]] began on the death of Ferdinand VII, he is said to have held back because he knew that the first leaders would be politicians and talkers. He did not take the field till the Carlist cause appeared to be at a very low ebb, and until he had received a commission from Don Carlos as commander-in-chief in [[Navarre]].

The whole force under his orders when he escaped from Pamplona on the night of 29 October 1833, and took the command next day in the [[Araquil]] Valley, was a few hundred ill-armed and dispirited guerrilleros. In a few months Zumalacárregui had organized the Carlist forces into a regular army. The difficulty he found in obtaining supplies was very great, for the coast towns and notably [[Bilbao]] support the "Cristino" (liberal) cause. It was mainly by captures from the government troops that he equipped his forces. He gradually obtained full possession of the [[End of Basque home rule in Spain|Southern Basque Country]], outside of the fortresses, which he had not the means to besiege.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  He organized the forces known as [[aduaneros]] and the [[Guías de Navarra]].  His chief bodyguard, and later biographer, was [[Charles Frederick Henningsen]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014|reason=not mentioned in EB1911}}

Whether as a guerrilla leader, or as a general conducting regular war in the mountains, he proved unconquerable.  He won the battles of [[Battle of Alsasua|Alsasua]], [[Battle of Alegría de Álava|Alegría de Álava]], and [[Battle of Venta de Echavarri|Venta de Echavarri]], for example, by employing guerrilla tactics.

By July 1834 he had made it safe for Don Carlos to join his headquarters. Zumalacárregui was by then strongly envied by the courtiers that surrounded the pretender, as well as by other military officers. Besides, Don Carlos was a somewhat naïve and easily suggestible man, and Zumalacárregui had therefore to drag behind him the whole weight of the distrust and intrigues of the court. Yet by the beginning of June 1835 he had made the Carlist cause triumphant to the north of the [[Ebro]], and had formed an army of more than 30,000 men, of much better quality than the constitutional forces.  He won the battle of [[Battle of Artaza|Artaza]] (20–22 April 1835).
[[Image:Bilbao Begoña-Galeria.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Location where Zumalacárregui suffered his fatal wound]]
[[File:Zumalacarregui i Carles.jpg|thumb|Zumalacárregui (right) in his distinctive [[Basque beret]] and brown [[Pelisse|pelisse]], speaking to [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Don Carlos]] (left) during a battle, 1837]]
If Zumalacárregui had been allowed to follow his own plans, which were to concentrate his forces and march on [[Madrid]], firstly seizing Logroño ([[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], [[Old Castile|Castile]]), he might well have put Don Carlos in possession of the capital. But the court was eager to obtain command of a seaport, because they thought this will facilitate the official recognition of Don Carlos as the legitimate heir to the Spanish Throne by other European courts. Thus, Zumalacárregui was ordered to besiege [[Bilbao]]. He obeyed reluctantly, and on 14 June 1835 was wounded by a [[musket]] bullet in the calf of the leg near the [[Basilica of Begoña]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The wound was trifling and would probably have been cured with ease, but Zumalacárregui decided to employ a famous Gipuzkoan quack called "Petriquillo", whom he trusted.&lt;ref&gt;Nowadays "Petriquillo" (= ''petrikilo'') is in [[Basque language|Basque]] a common name tantamount to 'quack' or 'dodgy healer'.&lt;/ref&gt; Petriquillo proceeded to remove the bullet from Zumalacárregui's leg, provoking a great loss of blood and probably an infection.{{citation needed|date=October 2014|reason=not mentioned in EB1911}} Don Carlos had insisted on sending his own physicians, but they hesitated about the best prognosis to follow, losing precious time and failing to stop Petriquillo from trying his "procedure" (he acted when they were not present) and in their hands the general died on 24 June 1835, not without suspicion of poison and after Petriquillo had hastily left the place.

Zumalacárregui was a fine type of the old royalist and religious principles of his people.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; The Carlist forces under his command were repeatedly refused quarter by the government's forces (which for years didn't recognize them as legitimate combatants). The increasing ferocity of the war, substantiated in routine executions of Carlist soldiers and officers, convinced him of the necessity of a similar retaliation against the liberal forces.  Zumalacárregui, however, would later sign the [[Lord Eliot Convention]], shortly before his own death, which aimed to end the indiscriminate executions by firing squad of prisoners of both sides.

== Popularity ==
[[File:Portada-Tío Tomás-Sabatier.jpg|thumb|''Tío Tomás'', a book of [[Memoir|memoirs]] of Zumalacárregui written by [[French people|French]] author Alexis Sabater in 1836]]
The most trustful and complete account of Zumalacarregui's Carlist campaign can be found in Juan Antonio de Zaratiegui's "Vida y hechos de Don Tomás de Zumalacárregui". Zaratiegui was his personal assistant, secretary and friend throughout the war, and also himself an important carlist military officer. Accounts of Zumalacárregui include ''The Most Striking Events of a Twelvemonth Campaign with Zumalacarregui in Navarre and the Basque Provinces'', by Charles Frederick Henningsen ([[London]], 1836) as well as a [[chapbook]] called "''Vida política y militar de Don Tomás Zumalacárregui''". Of Zumalacárregui, Henningsen writes:
{{quote|Now that Zumalacarregui's memory must descend, whatever be the issue of the contest, as an heir-loom to all classes of his countrymen, as long as the Spanish language endures, and that his name must be mingled in the songs of the peasantry with that of the [[El Cid|Cid]], it would be superfluous to say that he was no ordinary man; but, although, on the roll of those who have acquired a title to immortality, by the immense share he had in the early successes of the Royalist army, justice is scarcely done him.  It is doubtless that it required the iron frame and indomitable spirit of the mountaineers he commanded, to battle so long against man, want, and the elements.|Charles Frederick Henningsen,''Twelve Months' Campaign with Zumalacárregui''&lt;ref&gt;Charles Frederick Henningsen, Twelve Months' Campaign with Zumalacárregui (E.L Carey &amp; A. Hart, 1836), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2017 the [[ People's Party of the Basque Country]] called for a street named after him to be renamed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/basque-street-names-fuel-debate-around-historical-memory-1.2976931&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9349">'''Ukawsaw Gronniosaw''' (1705 &amp;ndash; September 1775), also known as '''James Albert''', was a freed [[slave]] and autobiographer. His autobiography is considered the first published by an African in Britain.

==The autobiography==
{{Slavery}}
Gronniosaw's autobiography was produced in [[Kidderminster]] in 1772.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanley|first=Ryan|date=2015|title=Calvinism, Proslavery and James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0144039X.2014.920973|journal=Slavery &amp; Abolition|doi=|pmid=|access-date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is entitled ''A Narrative of the Most remarkable Particulars in the Life of James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, an African Prince, As related by himself.''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The title page explains that it was ''committed to paper by the elegant pen of a young LADY of the town of LEOMINSTER''. It was the first [[Slave narrative]] in the [[English language]]. Published in [[Bath, Somerset]], in December 1772, it gives a vivid account of Gronniosaw's life, from his capture in [[Africa]] through [[slavery]] to a life of poverty in [[Colchester]] and [[Kidderminster]]. He was attracted to this last town because it was at one time the home of [[Richard Baxter]], a 17th-century [[Calvinist]] minister whom Gronniosaw much admired.

The preface was written by the Reverend [[Walter Shirley (clergyman)|Walter Shirley]], cousin to [[Selina Hastings, Countess of Huntingdon]], who was the chief patron of the Calvinist wing of [[Methodism]]. He interprets Gronniosaw's experience of enslavement and his journey from Bornu to [[New York (state)|New York]] as an example of Calvinist [[predestination]] and [[election]].

A reference to his white-skinned sister, his willingness to leave Africa as his family believed in many deities instead of one almighty God, the fact that the closer to a white European he became — through clothing but mostly via language — the happier he was, his description of another black servant at his master's house as a "devil", have led critics to the conclusion that the narrative is devoid of the anti-slavery backlash ubiquitous in subsequent slave narratives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="''The Signifying Monkey'', Henry Louis Gates, Jr"&gt;[[Henry Louis Gates, Jr]], ''[[The Signifying Monkey]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], 1988, pp. 133-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the recent discovery of an [[obituary]], and a [[manuscript]] letter written by Gronniosaw to Hastings, the ''Narrative'' was the only significant source for the life of Gronniosaw.

==Life==
Gronniosaw was born in [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] (now north-eastern [[Nigeria]]): he claims he was doted on as the grandson of the king of Zaara. At the age of 15, he was taken by a [[Ghana|Gold Coast]] ivory merchant and sold to a Dutch captain for two yards of check cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYgRDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;authuser=1&amp;pg=PA364#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=African American Lives|last=Gates|first=Henry Louis|last2=Higginbotham|first2=Evelyn Brooks|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780195160246|location=New York|pages=364|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was bought by an American in [[Barbados]] and resold to a [[Calvinist]] minister, [[Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen|Theodorus Frelinghuysen]], in [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There he was taught to read and brought up as a Christian. Gronniosaw did indicate in his autobiography that he had a desire to go back to his family in Africa, but the minister denied this request and told him to focus on the Christian faith.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/gronniosaw/gronnios.html|title=A Narrative of the Most Remarkable Particulars in the Life of James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, an African Prince, as related by himself|last1=Gronniosaw|first1=James Albert Ukawsaw|date=1772|publisher=W.

Gronniosaw traveled to the Caribbean where he enlisted as a cook with a [[privateer]], and later as a soldier in the British army.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Scarlet and Black: Slavery and Dispossession in Rutgers History|last=Fuentes, Marisa J.|first=White, Deborah Gray|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780813591520|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in [[Martinique]] and [[Cuba]], before obtaining his discharge and crossing to England. At first he settled in Portsmouth, but, when his landlady swindled him out of most of his savings, was forced to seek his fortune in London. There he married a young English widow, Betty, who already had a child and bore him at least two more. They were forced by industrial unrest to look for work in [[Colchester]], where they were saved from starvation by Osgood Hanbury (a Quaker lawyer and grandfather of the abolitionist [[Sir Fowell Buxton, 1st Baronet|Thomas Fowell Buxton)]], who employed Gronniosaw in building work. Moving to [[Norwich]], Gronniosaw and his family again fell on hard times. Once again, they were saved by the kindness of a [[Quaker]], Henry Gurney (coincidentally, the grandfather of Fowell Buxton's wife, [[Hannah Gurney]]) who paid their rent arrears. A daughter died and was refused burial by the local clergy on the grounds that she was not baptised, although one at last offered to allow her to be buried in the churchyard, but not to read the burial service.

After pawning all their possessions, the family moved to [[Kidderminster]], where Betty managed to support them by working as a weaver. On Christmas Day 1771, Gronniosaw's remaining children, Mary Albert (aged six) Edward Albert (aged four) and newborn Samuel Albert were baptised in the Old Independent Meeting House in Kidderminster by [[Benjamin Fawcett (minister)|Benjamin Fawcett]], a Calvinist minister and associate of Selina Hastings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At around the same time, Gronniosaw received a letter and a charitable donation from Hastings herself. On 3 January 1772, he responded by thanking her for her 'favour', which arrived 'at a time of great necessity', and explained that he had just returned from 'Mrs Marlowe's' in nearby Leominster, 'were I was shewed kindness to from my Christian friends'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Shortly afterward, he began work on his life story, with the help apparently of an amanuensis from [[Leominster]], possibly the 'Mrs Marlowe' he had mentioned in his letter to Hastings. Until recently, nothing was known of his later life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Fryer]], ''Staying Power: The History of Black People in Britain'', Pluto Press, London, 1984, {{ISBN|0-86104-749-4}}, pp. 89-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 1774, Gronniosaw's fifth child, James Albert Jr, was baptised, again by Fawcett.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Chester local historian Terry Kavanagh has discovered a short obituary in the ''[[Chester Chronicle]]'', dated 2 October 1775:

&lt;blockquote&gt;On Thursday died, in this city, aged 70, James Albert Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, an African prince, of Zoara. He left the country in the early part of his life, with a view to acquire proper notions of the Divine Being, and of the worship due to Him. He met with many trials and embarrassments, was much afflicted and persecuted. His last moments exhibited that cheerful serenity which, at such a time, is the certain effect of a thorough conviction of the great truths of Christianity. He published a narrative of his life. Chester St Oswald's Burial 28th Sept. 1775: James Albert (a blackm), aged 70.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ukawsaw and Betty Gronniosaw are featured in the short animation entitled ''The Most Remarkable Particulars''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1821656/ The Most Remarkable Particulars]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yingge District''' ({{zh|t=[[wiktionary:鶯|鶯]][[wiktionary:歌|歌]][[wiktionary:區|區]]|p=Yīnggē Qū|poj=Eng-ko-khu|l=oriole song township}}) is an urban district located on the [[Dahan River]] in southwestern [[New Taipei City]] in northern [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taiwanheadlines.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=160061&amp;ctNode=5&lt;/ref&gt; It is famous for the production of [[porcelain]] and an abundance of art studios and shops.

==Origin of the name==
[[File:YingGe Rock.jpg|thumb|left|Yingge Rock, after which the district is named]]
On the northern side of Yingge lies a formation that went by the names of [[wiktionary:鸚哥|鸚哥]][[wiktionary:石|石]] ([[Parrot]] Stone), [[wiktionary:鷹|鷹]][[wiktionary:哥|哥]]石 ([[Eagle]] Brother Stone), and [[wiktionary:鶯|鶯]]哥石 ([[Golden oriole]] or [[Warbler]] Brother Stone). The last stone is where the current name of the district derives from.&lt;ref name="yco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yingge.tpc.gov.tw/_file/1306/SG/40049/D.html|title=認識鶯歌|publisher=Yingge City Office|accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern name "Yingge" ([[wiktionary:鶯|鶯]][[wiktionary:歌|歌]]) literally means "Warbler Song" in [[Chinese language|Chinese]].

According to legend, the rock formation produced a [[Miasma theory of disease|miasma]] that disoriented, sickened, and sometimes killed passers-by.  One day, General [[Koxinga]] led his army past the rock.  When they were caught in the miasma, he ordered his cannon to fire against the rock.  When the neck of the stone eagle was broken, the miasma lifted and the troops could continue on their march.

==History==
According to legend, by 1684, the Yingge area already had [[Hakka people|Hakka]] migrants who specialized in cultivating [[tea]].&lt;ref name="yco" /&gt; According to the locals, the history of [[ceramic]]s in Yingge began 200 years ago when Wu An (吳鞍) immigrated from [[Guangzhou]] to Yingge to become the first potter in the area. Later, Chen Kun (陳昆), a brick maker, moved to the area and the two strived to make Yingge into the centre of Taiwan's ceramics industry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2004/10/15/2003207010 Article], ''[[Taipei Times]]'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, Yingge Stone Village (鶯歌石庄) was renamed to Yingge Village (鶯歌庄). In 1940, the village was promoted to Yingge Street (鶯歌街), and in 1945 was changed to Yingge Small Town (鶯歌鎮).&lt;ref name="yco" /&gt; Today, Yingge is the largest centre for ceramic production in Taiwan, with over 800 ceramic-related businesses in the area.
