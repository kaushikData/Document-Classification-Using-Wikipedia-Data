A United States-led coalition invaded [[Iraq]], and the [[Iraq War]] led to the end of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s rule as Iraqi President and the [[Ba'ath Party]] in Iraq. [[Al-Qaeda]] and affiliated [[Islamism|Islamist]] militant groups performed terrorist acts throughout the decade. These acts included the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], 7/7 [[Timeline of the 2005 London bombings|London bombings]] in 2005, and the [[Mumbai attacks]] related to al-Qaeda in 2008. The [[European Union]] expanded its sanctions amid [[Iran]]'s failure to comply with its transparency obligations under the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and [[United Nations]] resolutions.

The War on Terror generated [[Criticism of the War on Terror|extreme controversy]] around the world, with questions regarding the justification for certain U.S. actions leading to a loss of support for the American government, both in and outside the United States.&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Losing War on Terror|publisher=NPR|date=21 August 2007|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13818670|accessdate=1 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508202323/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13818670|archivedate=8 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional armed conflict occurred in the [[Middle East]], including between [[Israel]] and [[Hezbollah]], then with Israel and [[Hamas]]. The greatest loss of life due to [[natural disaster]] came from the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], which caused a [[tsunami]] that killed around one quarter-million people and displaced well over a million others. Cooperative international rescue missions by many countries from around the world helped in efforts by the most affected nations to rebuild and recover from the devastation. An enormous loss of life and property value came in 2005, when [[Hurricane Katrina]] flooded nearly the entire city of [[New Orleans]]. The resulting political fallout was severely damaging to the [[George W. Bush]] administration because of its perceived failure to act promptly and effectively. In 2008, [[Barack Obama]] was elected President of the United States and became the first African-American U.S. president when he succeeded Bush in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/obama_inauguration/7839229.stm|title=Historic moment as Obama sworn in|work=BBC News|date=January 20, 2009|accessdate=February 13, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302070619/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/obama_inauguration/7839229.stm|archivedate=2014-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[War on Terror]] (2001–present) – refers to several [[Ideology|ideological]], military, and diplomatic campaigns aimed at putting an end to [[international terrorism]] by preventing groups defined by the U.S. and its allies as [[terrorist groups|terrorist]] (largely [[Islamism|Islamist]] groups such as [[al-Qaeda]], [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]]) from posing a threat to the U.S. and its allies, and by putting an end to [[state-sponsored terrorism|state sponsorship of terrorism]]. The campaigns were launched by the United States, with support from [[NATO]] and other allies, following the [[September 11 attacks]] that were carried out by al-Qaeda. Today the term has become mostly associated with Bush administration-led wars in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].
**[[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)]] – In 2001, the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Canada and Australia [[United States invasion of Afghanistan|invaded]] [[Afghanistan]] seeking to oust the [[Taliban]] and find al-Qaeda mastermind [[Osama bin Laden]]. In 2011, the US government claimed [[Navy Seals]] had killed Bin Laden and buried his body at sea. Fatalities of coalition troops: 1,553 (2001 to 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. troops' death toll in Afghanistan doubles in 2009|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-12/28/content_12718088.htm|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|deadurl=no|accessdate=February 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115060015/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-12/28/content_12718088.htm|archivedate=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Iraq War]] (2003–2011) – In 2003, the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, Australia and Poland [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invaded]] and occupied Iraq. Claims that Iraq had [[WMDs in Iraq|weapons of mass destruction]] at its disposal were later found to be unproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/03/13/alqaeda.saddam/| work=CNN| title=Hussein's Iraq and al Qaeda not linked, Pentagon says|accessdate=April 21, 2010|date=March 13, 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429034736/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/03/13/alqaeda.saddam/| archivedate=April 29, 2010| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war, which ended the rule of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Ba'ath Party]], also led to violence against the coalition forces and between many [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Shia Islam|Shia]] Iraqi groups, and to al-Qaeda [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq|operations in Iraq]]. [[Casualties of the Iraq War]]: Approximately 110,600 between March 2003 to April 2009. Hussein was eventually sentenced to death and hanged on December 30, 2006.
*[[Arab–Israeli conflict]] (Early 20th century – present)
**[[2006 Lebanon War]] (summer 2006) – took place in southern [[Lebanon]] and northern [[Israel]]. The principal parties were [[Hezbollah]] paramilitary forces and the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli military]]. The war that began as military operation in response to the abduction of two Israeli reserve soldiers by the Hezbollah, gradually strengthened and became a wider confrontation.
**[[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] (Early 20th century – present)
***[[Second Intifada]] (2000–2005) – After the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]] failed to bring about a [[Palestinian state]], in September 2000 the [[Second Intifada]] (uprising) broke out, a period of intensified Palestinian-Israeli violence, which has been taking place until the present day. As a result of the significant increase of suicide bombing attacks within Israeli population centers during the first years of the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]],&lt;ref name="ISF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.securityfence.mod.gov.il/Pages/ENG/questions.htm|title=Questions and Answers|accessdate=17 April 2007|date=22 February 2004|work=Israel's Security Fence|publisher=The State of Israel|quote=The Security Fence is being built with the sole purpose of saving the lives of the Israeli citizens who continue to be targeted by the terrorist campaign that began in 2000.

As such, the State of Israel not only has the right but also the obligation to do everything in its power to lessen the impact and scope of terrorism on the citizens of Israel.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003072906/http://www.securityfence.mod.gov.il/Pages/ENG/questions.htm|archivedate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in June 2002 Israel began the construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier|West Bank Fence]] along the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] border arguing that the barrier is necessary to protect Israeli civilians from [[Palestinian political violence|Palestinian terrorism]].

Palestinian militants killed 23 Israelis and foreign visitors in 2006, down from a high of 289 in 2002 during the height of the uprising. Most significant, successful suicide bombings in Israel nearly came to a halt. Last year, only two Palestinian suicide bombers managed to sneak into Israel for attacks that killed 11 people and wounded 30 others. Israel has gone nearly nine months without a suicide bombing inside its borders, the longest period without such an attack since 2000[...] An Israeli military spokeswoman said one major factor in that success had been Israel's controversial separation barrier, a still-growing {{Convert|250|mi|km|adj=on}} network of concrete walls, high-tech fencing and other obstacles that cuts through parts of the West Bank. ‘The security fence was put up to stop terror, and that's what it's doing,' said Capt. Noa Meir, a spokeswoman for the Israel Defense Forces. [...] Opponents of the wall grudgingly acknowledge that it has been effective in stopping bombers, though they complain that its route should have followed the border between Israel and the Palestinian territories known as the Green Line. [...] IDF spokeswoman Meir said Israeli military operations that disrupted militants planning attacks from the West Bank also deserved credit for the drop in Israeli fatalities.

*The [[Colombian Armed Conflict]] continues causing deaths and terror in [[Colombia]]. Beginning in 1964, the [[FARC]] and [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] narcoterrorist groups were taking control of rural areas of the country by the beginning of the decade, while terrorist paramilitaries grew in other places as businesspeople and politicians thought the State would lose the war against guerrillas. However, after the failure of the peace process and the activation of [[Plan Colombia]], [[Álvaro Uribe Vélez]] was elected president in 2002, starting a massive attack on terrorist groups, with cooperation from civil population, foreign aid and legal armed forces. The [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]] paramilitary organization disbanded in 2006, while ELN guerrillas have been weakened. The [[Popular Liberation Army]] demobilized while the country's biggest terrorist group, [[FARC]] has been weakened and most of their top commanders have been killed or died during the decade. During the second half of the decade, a new criminal band has been formed by former members of AUC who did not demobilize, calling themselves [[Aguilas Negras]]. Although the Colombian State has taken back control over most of the country, narcoterrorism still causes pain in the country. Since 2008, the Internet has become a new field of battle. Facebook has gained nationwide popularity and has become the birthplace of many civil movements against narcoterrorism such as "Colombia Soy Yo" (I am Colombia) or "Fundación Un Millón de Voces" (One Million Voices Foundation), responsible for the international protests against illegal groups during the last years.

The competition for oil wealth has led to an endless violence cycle between innumerable [[ethnic groups]], causing the [[militarization]] of nearly the entire region that was occupied by militia groups as well as [[Military of Nigeria|Nigerian military]] and the forces of the Nigerian Police.
*[[Algerian Civil War]] (1991–2002) – the conflict effectively ended with a government victory, following the surrender of the [[Islamic Salvation Army]] and the 2002 defeat of the [[Armed Islamic Group]]. It is estimated that more than 100,000 people were killed during the course of the conflict.

As a result, by June–July 2003, [[President of Liberia|president]] [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]]'s government controlled only a third of the country. The capital [[Monrovia]] [[Siege of Monrovia|was besieged]] by LURD, and that group's shelling of the city resulted in the deaths of many civilians. Thousands of people were displaced from their homes as a result of the conflict.
*[[Insurgency in the Maghreb (2002–present)]] – [[Algeria]] has been the subject of an Islamic insurgency since 2002 waged by the Sunni Islamic [[Jihad]]ist militant group [[Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat]] (GSPC).

*[[Civil war in Afghanistan (1996–2001)]] – an armed conflict that continued after the capture of [[Kabul]] by the [[Taliban]], in which the formation of the [[Afghan Northern Alliance]] attempted to oust the Taliban.

===Coups===
{{Main|List of coups d'état and coup attempts#2000–2009}}
[[File:Coup-d'etat-2-web-cnni.jpg|thumb|[[2006 Thai coup d'état]]]] The most prominent [[coups d'état]] of the decade include:
*[[Overthrow of Slobodan Milošević|2000 overthrow of Slobodan Milošević in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] – after [[Slobodan Milošević]] was accused by opposition figures of winning the 2000 election through electoral fraud, mass protests led by the opposition movement [[Otpor!]] pressure [[Slobodan Milošević]] to resign. Milošević was later arrested in 2001 and sent to the Hague to face war crimes charges for his alleged involvement in war crimes of the [[Yugoslav Wars]].
*[[2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt]] – a failed military coup d'état on April 11, 2002, which aimed to overthrow the president of Venezuela [[Hugo Chávez]]. During the coup Hugo Chávez was arrested and [[Pedro Carmona]] became the interim President for 47&amp;nbsp;hours. The coup led to a pro-Chávez uprising that the Metropolitan Police attempted to suppress. The pro-Chávez Presidential Guard eventually retook the [[Miraflores presidential palace]] without firing a shot, leading to the collapse of the Carmona government.
*[[2004 Haitian coup d'état]] – a conflict fought for several weeks in [[Haiti]] during February 2004 that resulted in the premature end of President [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]]'s second term, and the installment of an interim government led by [[Gérard Latortue]].

*[[Fatah–Hamas conflict]] (2006–2009) – an armed conflict fought between the two main Palestinian factions, [[Fatah]] and [[Hamas]] with each vying to assume political control of the [[Palestinian territories]]. In June 2007, [[Battle for Gaza (2007)|Hamas took control of the entire Gaza Strip]], and established a separate government while Fatah remained in control of the West Bank. This in practice divided the [[Palestinian Authority]] into two. Various forces affiliated with Fatah engaged in combat with Hamas, in numerous gun battles. Most Fatah leaders eventually escaped to Egypt and the West Bank, while some were captured and killed.
*[[2009 Honduras coup d'état]] – The armed forces of the country entered the president's residence and overthrew president [[Manuel Zelaya]]. (see [[2009 Honduran constitutional crisis]]).

[[File:Natanz nuclear.jpg|right|thumb|Anti-aircraft guns guarding [[Natanz#Nuclear facility|Natanz Nuclear Facility]] in Iran]]
*Since 2005, [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran's nuclear program]] has become the subject of contention with the Western world due to suspicions that Iran could divert the civilian nuclear technology to a weapons program. This has led the [[UN Security Council]] to impose [[sanctions against Iran]] on select companies linked to this program, thus furthering its economic isolation on the international scene. The [[U.S. Director of National Intelligence]] said in February 2009 that Iran would not realistically be able to a get a nuclear weapon until 2013, if it chose to develop one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN25158068| title=RPT-EXCLUSIVE-Iran would need 18 months for atom bomb-diplomats| first=Louis| last=Charbonneau| date=October 26, 2009| agency=Reuters| accessdate=November 30, 2011| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828042601/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN25158068| archivedate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the fires were ignited by either fallen or clashing power lines or deliberately lit.
*The cold snap of 2009–2010 caused disturbed life in Europe, Asia and America. A total of 21 people were reported to have died during the cold spell in the UK. In Russia, by 26 December 2009 [[Saint Petersburg]] was under 35&amp;nbsp;cm of snow, creating the largest December snowfall recorded in the city since 1881. [[Winter of 2009–2010 in Europe]].

====Epidemics====

[[Antimicrobial resistance|Antibiotic resistance]] is a serious and growing phenomenon in contemporary medicine and has emerged as one of the eminent public health concerns of the 21st century, particularly as it pertains to pathogenic organisms (the term is not especially relevant to organisms which don't cause disease in humans).

The outbreak of [[foot-and-mouth disease]] in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2001 caused a crisis in British agriculture and tourism. This [[epizootic]] saw 2,000 cases of the disease in farms across most of the British countryside. Over 10 million sheep and cattle were killed.

Between November 2002 and July 2003, an outbreak of [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS) occurred in Hong Kong, with 8,273 cases and 775 deaths worldwide (9.6% fatality) according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Within weeks, SARS spread from Hong Kong to infect individuals in 37 countries in early 2003.

[[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']]: the [[Office for National Statistics]] reported 1,629 [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]-related deaths in [[England and Wales]] during 2005, indicating a MRSA-related mortality rate half the rate of that in the United States for 2005, even though the figures from the British source were explained to be high because of "improved levels of reporting, possibly brought about by the continued high public profile of the disease" during the time of the [[2005 United Kingdom General Election]]. MRSA is thought to have caused 1,652 deaths in 2006 in UK up from 51 in 1993.

'''Footnote:'''

The [[Walkerton Tragedy]] is a series of events that accompanied the contamination of the water supply of Walkerton, Ontario, Canada, by E. coli bacteria in May 2000.
Starting May 11, 2000, many residents of the community of about 5,000 people began to simultaneously experience bloody [[diarrhea]], gastrointestinal infections and other symptoms of E. coli infection.
Seven people died directly from drinking the E. coli contaminated water, who might have been saved if the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission had admitted to contaminated water sooner, and about 2,500 became ill.

In 2001 a similar outbreak in [[North Battleford]], [[Saskatchewan]] caused by the protozoan [[Cryptosporidium]] affected at least 5,800 people.

===Globalization and its discontents===
{{See also|Globalization#Effects of globalization|Offshore outsourcing#Source of conflict|Business process outsourcing in India}}
[[File:An Indian call center.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Offshore outsourcing]] of jobs, such as this [[call centre]] in India, significantly increased during the decade as many [[multinational corporation]]s moved their [[manufacturing]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] from [[western countries]] to [[developing countries]].]]
The removal of [[Trade barrier|trade and investment barriers]], the growth of [[domestic market]]s, [[Purchasing power parity|artificially low currencies]], the [[History of education#Recent world-wide trends|proliferation of education]], the rapid development of [[high tech]] and [[information systems]] industries and the growth of the [[world economy]] lead to a significant growth of [[offshore outsourcing]] during the decade as many [[multinational corporation]]s significantly increased [[subcontractor|subcontracting]] of [[manufacturing]] (and increasingly, [[Service (economics)|services]]) across national boundaries in [[developing countries]] and particularly in China and India, due to [[Outsourcing#Reasons|many benefits]] and mainly because the two countries which are the two most populous countries in the world provide huge pools from which to find talent and as because both countries are low cost sourcing countries. As a result of this growth, many of these developing countries accumulated [[capital (economics)|capital]] and started investing abroad. Other countries, including the [[United Arab Emirates]], Australia, Brazil and Russia, benefited from increased demand for their mineral and energy resources that global growth generated. The hollowing out of manufacturing was felt in Japan and parts of the United States and Europe which had not been able to develop successful innovative industries. Opponents point out that the practice of offshore outsourcing by countries with higher wages leads to the reduction of their own domestic employment and domestic investment. As a result, many customer service jobs as well as jobs in the information technology sectors ([[data processing]], [[computer programming]], and [[technical support]]) in countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have been or are potentially affected.

While [[global trade]] rose in the decade (partially driven by China's entry into the [[WTO]] in 2001), there was little progress in the multilateral trading system. [[International trade]] continued to expand during the decade as emerging economies and developing countries, in particular China and South-Asian countries, benefited low wages costs and most often undervalued currencies. However, global negotiations to reduce tariffs did not make much progress, as member countries of the [[World Trade Organization]] did not succeed in finding agreements to stretch the extent of [[free trade]].&lt;ref&gt;[[EFE]] [http://www.abc.es/20080729/economia-economia/fracasan-negociaciones-ronda-doha-200807291828.html Fracasan las negociaciones de la Ronda de Doha para liberalizar el comercio] July 28, 2008, [[ABC (Spain)]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402/http://www.abc.es/20080729/economia-economia/fracasan-negociaciones-ronda-doha-200807291828.html|date=April 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Doha Round]] of negotiations, launched in 2001 by the WTO to promote development, failed to be completed because of growing tensions between regional areas.

The comparative rise of China, India, and other developing countries also contributed to their growing clout in [[International marketing|international fora]]. In 2009, it was determined that the [[G20]], originally a forum of finance ministers and central bank governors, would replace the [[G8]] as the main economic council.

'''[[2007 Chinese export recalls]]'''
In 2007 a series of product recalls and import bans were imposed by the product safety institutions of the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[European Union]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] against products manufactured in and exported from the [[mainland China|mainland]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) because of numerous alleged [[consumer safety]] issues.

Events in the confidence crisis included recalls on consumer goods such as [[2007 pet food recalls|pet food]], [[toy]]s, [[toothpaste]], [[lipstick]], and a ban on certain types of [[seafood]]. Also included are reports on the poor crash safety of Chinese automobiles, slated to enter the American and European markets in 2008. This created adverse consequences for the confidence in the safety and quality of mainland Chinese manufactured goods in the global economy.

The decade was marked by two financial and economic crises. In 2000, the [[Dot-com bubble]] burst, causing turmoil in financial markets and a [[early 2000s recession|decline in economic activity]] in the developed economies, in particular in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;BBC Mundo, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/business/newsid_1666000/1666319.stm Se contrae la economía mundial] November 21, 2001 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202175936/http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/business/newsid_1666000/1666319.stm|date=December 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the impact of the crisis on the activity was limited thanks to the intervention of the central banks, notably the U.S. [[Federal Reserve System]]. Indeed, [[Alan Greenspan]], leader of the Federal Reserve until 2006, cut the interest rates several times to avoid a severe recession,&lt;ref&gt;BBC Mundo, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/business/newsid_1685000/1685410.stm ¿Recesión global?], September 8, 2001 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203020449/http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/business/newsid_1685000/1685410.stm|date=December 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing an economic revival in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[[Agence France Presse]] [http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=680131 Greenspan dijo que las tasas se mantienen bajas], [[La Nación]], February 16, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Federal Reserve maintained low interest rates to favor economic growth, [[United States housing bubble|a housing bubble]] began to appear in the United States. In 2007, the rise in interest rates and the collapse of the housing market caused a wave of [[loan payment failures]] in the U.S. The subsequent [[subprime mortgage crisis|mortgage crisis]] caused a [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|global financial crisis]], because the subprime mortgages had been [[securitize]]d and sold to international banks and investment funds.

In 2007, the UK's [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]], delivered his final Mansion House speech as Chancellor before he moved into Number 10. Addressing financiers: "A new world order has been created", Everyone needed to follow the City's "great example", "an era that history will record as the beginning of a new Golden Age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rawnsley|first=Andrew|title=A golden age, and other things they wish they'd never said|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/19/gordonbrown-davidcameron-economic-policy|accessdate=February 14, 2013|newspaper=The Observer|date=October 19, 2008|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207022026/http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/oct/19/gordonbrown-davidcameron-economic-policy|archivedate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy crisis===
{{Main|2000s energy crisis}}

From the mid-1980s to September 2003, the inflation-adjusted price of a barrel of crude oil on NYMEX was generally under $25/barrel. During 2003, the price rose above $30, reached $60 by August 11, 2005, and peaked at $147.30 in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tfc-charts.com/chart/QM/W|title=Weekly Commodity Futures Price Chart: Crude Oil EmiNY|publisher=TFC-charts.com|accessdate=February 14, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502013508/http://tfc-charts.com/chart/QM/W|archivedate=2014-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators attributed these price increases to many factors, including reports from the United States Department of Energy and others showing a decline in petroleum reserves, worries over [[peak oil]], Middle East tension, and oil price speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,556519,00.html|first=Moira|last=Herbst|title=Speculation – But Not Manipulation|work=Der Spiegel|date=May 30, 2008|accessdate=February 14, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518065027/http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0%2C1518%2C556519%2C00.html|archivedate=May 18, 2012|deadurl=yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time, geopolitical events and natural disasters indirectly related to the global oil market had strong short-term effects on oil prices. These events and disasters included [[North Korea]]n missile tests, the 2006 conflict between Israel and Lebanon, worries over [[Iran]]ian nuclear plants in 2006 and [[Hurricane Katrina]]. By 2008, such pressures appeared to have an insignificant impact on oil prices given the onset of the global recession. The recession caused demand for energy to shrink in late 2008 and early 2009 and the price plunged as well. However, it surged back in May 2009, bringing it back to November 2008 levels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/Oil-prices-jump-to-new-high-apf-15149868.html?.v=10 Yahoo Finance]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5glwc7hoY?url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Oil-prices-jump-to-new-high-apf-15149868.html?.v=10|date=May 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fast-growing economies throughout the world, especially in Asia, also were a major factor in the rapidly increasing demand for [[fossil fuels]], which—along with fewer new petroleum finds, greater extraction costs, and political turmoil—forced two other trends: a soar in the [[price of petroleum]] products and a push by governments and businesses to promote the development of [[Environmental technology|environmentally friendly technology]] (known informally as "green" technology). However, a side-effect of the push by some industrial nations to "go green" and utilize [[biofuels]] was a decrease in the supply of food and a subsequent increase in the price of the same. It partially caused the [[2007 food price crisis]], which seriously affected the world's poorer nations with an even more severe shortage of food.&lt;ref&gt;Global Policy [http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/hunger/general/2008/0303foodcrisis.htm Global Policy Forum, Are We Approaching a Global Food Crisis?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422/http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/hunger/general/2008/0303foodcrisis.htm|date=April 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rise of the euro===
{{See also|Euro|Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union}}
[[File:Euro banknotes 2002.png|thumb|left|The euro became the currency of members of the [[Eurozone]].]]
A common currency for most EU member states, the [[euro]], was established electronically in 1999, officially tying all the currencies of each participating nation to each other. The new currency was put into circulation in 2002 and the old currencies were phased out. Only three countries of the then 15 member states decided not to join the euro (the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden). In 2004 the EU undertook a major eastward enlargement, admitting 10 new member states (eight of which were former communist states). Two more, [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]], joined in 2007, establishing a union of 27 nations.

The euro has since become the second largest [[reserve currency]] and the second most traded currency in the world after the US$.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.org/publ/rpfxf07t.pdf|title=Triennial Central Bank Survey 2007&amp;nbsp;– BIS&amp;nbsp;– December 2007|publisher=BIS|date=December 19, 2007|accessdate=July 25, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825004633/http://www.bis.org/publ/rpfxf07t.pdf|archivedate=2013-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{As of|2009|10}}, with more than €790&amp;nbsp;billion in circulation, the euro was the currency with the highest combined value of banknotes and coins in [[circulation (currency)|circulation]] in the world, having surpassed the US$.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;{{As of|2009|10|30|df=US}}:&lt;br /&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; for "his contributions to geometry and his revolutionary insights into the analytical and geometric structure of the [[Ricci flow]]." Perelman declined to accept the award or to appear at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|congress]], stating: "I'm not interested in money or fame, I don't want to be on display like an animal in a zoo."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8585407.stm Russian maths genius Perelman urged to take $1m prize] bbc.co.uk, Wednesday, 24 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 2006, the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' recognized Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture as the scientific "[[Breakthrough of the Year]]", the first such recognition in the area of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dana Mackenzie|title=BREAKTHROUGH OF THE YEAR. The Poincaré Conjecture—Proved|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|year=2006|volume=314|pages=1848–1849|doi=10.1126/science.314.5807.1848|issue=5807|pmid=17185565|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Poincaré conjecture is one of the seven [[Millennium Problems]] and the first to be solved.

=====Physics=====
*2001 - Scientists assembled molecules into basic [[Molecular circuit|circuits]], raising hopes for a new world of [[nanoelectronics]]. If researchers can wire these circuits into intricate computer chip architectures, this new generation of molecular electronics will undoubtedly provide computing power to launch scientific breakthroughs for decades.
*2008 – [[CERN]]'s [[Large Hadron Collider]], the [[List of accelerators in particle physics#Hadron colliders|world's largest and highest-energy]] [[particle accelerator]] ever made, was completed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/space/11/13/water.moon.nasa/index.html| work=CNN| title=NASA finds 'significant' water on moon| accessdate=April 21, 2010| date=November 14, 2009| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406133228/http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/space/11/13/water.moon.nasa/index.html| archivedate=April 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Space=====

[[File:Water Around Fresh Moon Crater.jpg|thumb|These images show water in a very young lunar crater on the side of the moon that faces away from Earth.]]
*2000 – Beginning on November 2, 2000, the [[International Space Station]] has remained continuously inhabited. The [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttles]] helped make it the largest [[space station]] in history, despite one of the Shuttles [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|disintegrating upon re-entry]] in 2003. By the end of 2009 the station was supporting [[Expedition 22|5 long-duration crew members]].
*2001 – [[Space tourism]]/[[Private spaceflight]] begins with American [[Dennis Tito]], paying Russia US$20 million for a week-long stay to the [[International Space Station]].
*2004 – The [[Mars Exploration Rover|Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Mission]] successfully reached the surface of [[Mars]] in 2004, and sent detailed data and images of the landscape there back to Earth. ''[[Opportunity (rover)|Opportunity]]'' discovers evidence that an area of [[Mars]] was once covered in water. Both rovers were each expected to last only 90 days, however both completely exceeded expectations and continued to explore through the end of the decade and beyond.
*2004 – [[Scaled Composites]]' [[SpaceShipOne]] becomes the first privately built and operated [[human spaceflight|manned spacecraft]] to achieve [[spaceflight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/16769-spaceshipone-first-private-spacecraft.html|title=SpaceShipOne: The First Private Spacecraft – The Most Amazing Flying Machines Ever|last=Sharp|first=Tim|publisher=Space.com|date=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*2006 – As a result of the discovery of [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], a [[Kuiper Belt]] object larger than [[Pluto]], Pluto is demoted to a "[[dwarf planet]]" after being considered a planet for 76 years, redefining the solar system to have eight planets and three dwarf planets.
*2009 – After having analyzed the data from the [[LCROSS]] lunar impact, in 2009 [[NASA]] announced that the discovery of a "significant" quantity of [[Lunar water|water]] in the [[Moon]]'s [[Cabeus (crater)|Cabeus]] crater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2009/nov/HQ_09-265_LCROSS_Confirms_Water.html|title=NASA's LCROSS Impacts Confirm Water in Lunar Crater|publisher=NASA|date=November 13, 2009|accessdate=November 21, 2009|quote=Preliminary data from NASA's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS, indicates the mission successfully uncovered water in a permanently shadowed lunar crater.|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lS1og3JX?url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2009/nov/HQ_09-265_LCROSS_Confirms_Water.html|archivedate=November 21, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/space/11/13/water.moon.nasa/index.html|work=CNN|title=NASA finds 'significant' water on moon|date=November 13, 2009|accessdate=November 21, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091116064753/http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/space/11/13/water.moon.nasa/index.html|archivedate=November 16, 2009|deadurl=yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
====Automobiles====
*[[Automotive navigation system]]s become widely popular making it possible to direct vehicles to any destination in real-time as well as detect traffic and suggest alternate routes with the use of [[GPS navigation device]]s.
*Greater interest in [[future energy development]] due to [[global warming]] and the potential exhaustion of [[crude oil]]. [[Photovoltaic]]s increase in popularity as a result.
*The [[Hybrid vehicle]]s market, which became somewhat popular towards the middle of the decade, underwent major advances notably typified by such cars as the [[Toyota Prius]], [[Ford Escape]], and the [[Honda Insight]] though by December 2010 they accounted for less than 0.5% of the world cars.
* Many more computers and other technologies were implemented in vehicles throughout the decade such as: [[Xenon HID headlamp|Xenon HID headlights]], [[GPS]], [[DVD player]]s, self-diagnosing systems, memory systems for car settings, back-up sensors and cameras, in-car media systems, MP3 player compatibility, [[USB]] drive compatibility, [[Remote keyless system|keyless start and entry]], [[satellite radio]], [[Voice command device|voice-activation]], cellphone connectivity, [[Head-Up Display|HUD]] (Head-Up-Display) and [[infrared camera]]s. In addition, more safety features were implemented in vehicles throughout the decade such as: [[Precrash system|advanced pre-collision safety systems]], [[Backup camera]]s, [[Blind spot monitor]], [[Adaptive cruise control]], [[Adaptive headlamp]]s, [[Automatic parking]], [[Lane departure warning system]]s and the [[Advanced Automatic Collision Notification]] system [[Onstar]] (on all GM models).
*Car styling in the 2000s differed throughout the decade. Many automakers strayed from the round and ovoid designs of the 1990s in favor of more boxy, angular designs – the [[Dodge Charger]] and [[Chrysler 300]] being notable examples. Many vehicles, especially crossovers, were abstract and futuristic, a trend started by the successful [[Nissan Murano]] and [[Infiniti FX]] crossovers.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Communications====
[[File:Texting.jpg|thumb|The popularity of mobile phones and [[text messaging]] surged in the 2000s in the Western world.]]
*The popularity of mobile phones and [[text messaging]] surged in the 2000s in the Western world. The advent of text messaging made possible new forms of interaction that were not possible before, leading to positive implications such as having the ability to receive information on the move. Nevertheless, it also led to negative social implications such as "[[cyberbullying]]" and the rise of traffic collisions caused by drivers who were distracted as they were [[texting while driving]]. One such problem was the fad of [[Happy Slapping]] in [[Europe]], in which an individual assaults an unwitting victim while others record the assault (commonly with a [[camera phone]] or a [[smartphone]]). Though the name usually refers to relatively minor acts of violence such as hitting or slapping the victim, more serious crimes such as [[manslaughter]],&lt;ref name="Happy slap youths admit killing"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/10331547.stm| work=BBC News| title=Happy slap youths admit killing| date=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[rape]], and [[sexual assault]] have been classified as '''"happy slapping"''' by the media.&lt;ref name="sexattack"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6970516.stm|title=Sex attack phone girls detained|work=BBC News|date=August 30, 2007|accessdate=February 19, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424130557/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6970516.stm|archivedate=2009-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mobile internet]], first launched in Japan with the [[i-mode]] in 1999, became increasingly popular with people in developed countries throughout the decade, thanks to improving cell phone capabilities and advances in mobile telecommunications technology, such as [[3G]].
*E-mail continued to be popular throughout the decade, and began to replace "[[snail mail]]" (also known, more neutrally, as '''paper mail''', '''postal mail''', '''land mail''', or simply '''mail''' or '''post''') as the primary way of sending letters and other messages to people in faraway locations, though it has been available since 1971.
*[[Social networking site]]s arose as a new way for people to stay in touch no matter where they are, as long as they have an [[internet connection]]. The first social networking sites were [[Friendster]], [[Myspace]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]] in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006, respectively. Myspace was the most popular social networking website until June 2009 when Facebook overtook Myspace in the number of American users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/former-myspace-ceo-reveals-what-facebook-did-right-to-dominate-social-media/|title=Former MySpace CEO explains why MySpace lost out to Facebook so badly|author=Marc Schenker|publisher=Digital Trends|date=May 12, 2015|accessdate=December 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Smartphone]]s, which combine mobile phones with the features of [[personal digital assistant]]s and [[portable media player]]s, first emerged in the 1990s but did not become very popular until late in the 2000s. Smartphones are rich in features and often have high resolution [[touchscreen]]s and [[web browser]]s. The first modern smartphone was the [[iPhone (1st generation)|iPhone]]; it was released on June 29, 2007 in the [[United States]], and in the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Portugal]], the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Austria]] in November 2007.  It was the first smartphone to not include a physical keyboard, solely utilizing a touch screen and a home button.
*Due to the major success of broadband Internet connections, [[Voice over IP]] begins to gain popularity as a replacement for [[Plain old telephone service|traditional telephone]] lines.

====Computing and Internet====
In the 2000s, the Internet became a mainstay, strengthening its grip on Western society while becoming increasingly available in the developing world.
{{main|Timeline of computing 2000–2009}}
[[File:Googlelogo.png|thumb|[[Google Search|Google]] becomes the Internet's most visited website.]]
*A huge jump in [[Broadband internet access|broadband internet usage]] globally – for example, from 6% of U.S. internet users in June 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bethea, Neil|author2=Jacob Williams|author3=Yiwen Yu|last-author-amp=yes|title=Broadband services in the United States|quote=Growth of Broadband Users:June 2000:total:4,367,434|publisher=Ohio State University|date=June 2003|page=9|url=http://www.nrri.ohio-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/2068/814/3/Article+1-Bethea+_Broadband_.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904211822/http://www.nrri.ohio-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/2068/814/3/Article%2B1-Bethea%2B_Broadband_.pdf|archivedate=September 4, 2006|format=PDF|accessdate=November 30, 2011|deadurl=yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to what one mid-decade study predicted would be 62% by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharma|first=Dinesh|title=Study: Broadband penetration to surge by 2010|date=August 2, 2005|publisher=CNET News.com|url=http://news.cnet.com/Study+Broadband+penetration+to+surge+by+2010/2100-1034_3-5815756.html| accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2007, over 80% of U.S. Internet users were connected via broadband and broadband internet has been almost a required standard for quality internet browsing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.websiteoptimization.com/bw/0703/|title=US Broadband Penetration Breaks 80% Among Active Internet Users|publisher=WebSiteOptimization.com|date=May 2007| accessdate=November 30, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030184150/http://www.websiteoptimization.com/bw/0703/|archivedate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Wireless internet]] became prominent by the end of the decade, as well as internet access in devices besides computers, such as mobile phones and gaming consoles.
*Email became a standard form of interpersonal written communication, with popular addresses available to the public on [[Outlook.com|Hotmail (now Outlook.com)]], [[Gmail]] and [[Yahoo! Mail]].
*[[Text normalization|Normalisation]] became increasingly important as massive standardized [[corpus linguistics|corpora]] and [[lexicon]]s of spoken and written language became widely available to [[Layman|laypeople]], just as documents from the paperless office were archived and retrieved with increasing efficiency using [[XML]]-based markup.
*[[Peer-to-peer]] technology gained massive popularity with [[file sharing]] systems enabling users to share any audio, video and data files or anything in digital format, as well as with applications which share real-time data, such as [[Voice over IP|telephony]] traffic.
*[[Virtual private network|VPN]]s (virtual private networks) became likewise accessible to the general public, and data encryption remained a major issue for the stability of web commerce.
* Boom in music downloading and the use of [[data compression]] to quickly transfer music over the Internet, with a corresponding rise of portable digital audio players. As a result, the [[entertainment industry]] struggled through the decade to find digital delivery systems for music, movies, and other media that reduce [[copyright infringement]] and preserve profit.
*The [[USB flash drive]] replaces the [[floppy disk]] as the preferred form of low-capacity mobile data storage.

====Electronics====
*[[Global Positioning System|GPS]] (Global Positioning System) becomes very popular especially in the tracking of items or people, and the use in cars (see [[Automotive navigation system]]s). Games that utilize the system, such as [[geocaching]], emerge and become popular.
*Green [[laser pointer]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/laserpic/glpdpics.htm Sam's Laser FAQ: Dissection of Green Laser Pointer]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522190301/http://www.repairfaq.org/sam/laserpic/glpdpics.htm|date=May 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared on the market circa 2000, and are the most common type of DPSS lasers (also called DPSSFD for "diode pumped solid state frequency-doubled").

In late 2004 and early 2005, came a significant increase in reported incidents linked to [[laser pointer]]s – see [[Lasers and aviation safety]]. The wave of incidents may have been triggered in part by "copycats" who read press accounts of laser pointer incidents. In one case, David Banach of New Jersey was charged under federal [[Patriot Act]] anti-terrorism laws, after he allegedly shone a laser pointer at aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Levin|first=Alan|url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2005-01-04-laser-aircraft_x.htm|title=N.J. man charged with aiming laser at aircraft|publisher=Usatoday.Com|date=January 5, 2005|accessdate=February 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*September 7, 2009, an EU watchdog warns of an "alarming increase" in cash machine fraud by organised criminal gangs across Europe using sophisticated skimming technology, together with an explosion in ram-raiding attacks on [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s.

ATM crime in Europe jumped to €485m (£423m) in 2008 following a 149% rise in attacks on cash machines. Gangs are turning to [[Bluetooth]] wireless technology to transmit card and [[personal identification number]] (PIN) details to nearby [[laptops]] and using increasingly sophisticated techniques to skim cards.

More conventional smash-and-grab attacks are also on the rise, says Enisa, the [[European Network and Information Security Agency]]. It reports a 32% rise in physical attacks on ATMs, ranging from ram raids to the use of rotary saws, blowtorches and diamond drills. It blames the increase on gangs from eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collinson|first=Patrick|title=Huge rise in cash-machine crime, watchdog warns|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/sep/07/cash-machine-crime-increase-fraud|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=February 24, 2013|location=London|date=September 7, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206184803/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/sep/07/cash-machine-crime-increase-fraud|archivedate=2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*2009 – In [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s third [[encyclical]] [[Caritas in Veritate]], he warns that a purely technocrat mindset where decisions are made only on grounds of efficiency will not deliver true development. Technical decisions must not be divorced from ethics. Benedict discusses bioethics and states that practices such as abortion, eugenics and euthanasia are morally hazardous and that accepting them can lead to greater tolerance for various forms of moral degradation. He turns to another consequence of the technocratic mindset, the viewing of people's personalities in purely psychological terms at the exclusion of the spiritual, which he says can lead to people feeling empty and abandoned even in prosperous societies.

[[Climate change]] and [[global warming]] became household words in the 2000s. Predictions tools made significant progress during the decade, UN-sponsored organisations such as the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] gained influence, and studies such as the [[Stern Review|Stern report]] influenced public support for paying the political and economic costs of countering climate change.

The global temperature kept climbing during the decade. In December 2009, the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) announced that the 2000s may have been the warmest decade since records began in 1850, with four of the five warmest years since 1850 having occurred in this decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i9TuMrvrknh-ZXwqmZ2N-48kff3wD9CF81LO0|title=UN: 2000–2009 likely warmest decade on record|publisher=[[Google News]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=December 8, 2009|accessdate=December 20, 2009|author=Hanley, Charles J.|quote=This decade is on track to become the warmest since records began in 1850, and 2009 could rank among the top-five warmest years, the U.N. weather agency reported Tuesday on the second day of a pivotal 192-nation climate conference.|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m7FhrAlX?url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i9TuMrvrknh-ZXwqmZ2N-48kff3wD9CF81LO0|archivedate=December 18, 2009|deadurl=no|df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/temperature-records-released-to-debunk-climate-change-claims-1836391.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mAN6SEtB?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/temperature-records-released-to-debunk-climate-change-claims-1836391.html|archivedate=December 20, 2009|title=Temperature records released to debunk climate change claims|agency=[[Press Association]]|work=The Independent|location=London|author=Beament, Emily|date=December 8, 2009|accessdate=December 20, 2009|deadurl=no|df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The WMO's findings were later echoed by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/science/earth/22warming.html?hpw|title=Past Decade Warmest on Record, NASA Data Shows|last=Broder|first=John M.|date=January 21, 2010|accessdate=January 23, 2010| work=The New York Times| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125154903/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/22/science/earth/22warming.html?hpw| archivedate=January 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Global Warming Predictions Map.jpg|thumb|Scientific studies on [[climate]] helped establish a consensus.]] Major natural disasters became more frequent and helped change public opinion. One of the deadliest heat waves in human history happened during the 2000s, mostly in Europe, with the [[2003 European heat wave]] killing 37,451 people over the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earth-policy.org/index.php?/plan_b_updates/2003/update29 Earth-policy.org], Janet Larsen, ''Record Heat Wave in Europe Takes 35,000 Lives: Far Greater Losses May Lie Ahead''.

While the fires are believed to have been caused by arson, they were widely reported as having been fueled by an excessive [[Early 2009 southeastern Australia heat wave|heatwave]] that was due in part to climate change. It has also been alleged that climate change was a cause of increased storms intensity, notably in the case of [[Hurricane Katrina]].

===International actions===
Climate change became a major issue for governments, populations and scientists. [[Climate change controversy|Debates on global warming]] and its causes made significant progress, as [[climate change denial]]s were refuted by [[Scientific opinion on climate change|most scientific studies]]. Decisive reports such as the [[Stern Review]] and the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|2007 IPCC Report]] almost established a climate change consensus. NGOs' actions and the commitment of political personalities (such as former U.S. Vice President [[Al Gore]]) also urged to international reactions against climate change. Documentary films ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' and ''[[Home (2009 film)|Home]]'' may have had a decisive impact.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Under the auspices of The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN Convention on Climate Change]] the [[Kyoto Protocol]] (aimed at combating global warming) entered into force on February 16, 2005. As of November 2009, [[List of Kyoto Protocol signatories|187 states have signed and ratified]] the protocol.&lt;ref name="Kyoto-PDF-unfccc"&gt;{{cite web| title=Kyoto Protocol: Status of Ratification|url=http://unfccc.int/files/kyoto_protocol/status_of_ratification/application/pdf/kp_ratification.pdf| date=January 14, 2009| accessdate=May 6, 2009| publisher=[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]]|format=PDF| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325015751/http://unfccc.int/files/kyoto_protocol/status_of_ratification/application/pdf/kp_ratification.pdf| archivedate=March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN Convention on Climate Change]] helped coordinate the efforts of the international community to fight potentially disastrous effects of human activity on the planet and launched negotiations to set an ambitious program of carbon emission reduction that began in 2007 with the [[Bali Road Map]]. However, the representatives of the then 192 member countries of the United Nations gathered in December 2009 for the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen Conference]] failed to reach a binding agreement to reduce carbon emissions because of divisions between regional areas.

However, as [[environmental technologies]] were to make up a potential market, some countries made large investments in [[renewable energies]], [[energy conservation]] and [[sustainable transport]]. Many governments launched national plans to promote sustainable energy. In 2003, the European Union members created an [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|emission trading scheme]], and in 2007 they assembled a [[European Union climate and energy package|climate and energy package]] to reduce further their carbon emission and improve their energy-efficiency. In 2009, the United States Obama administration set up the [[Green New Deal]], a plan to create millions of jobs in sectors related to [[environmentalism]].

Commercialization and globalization resulted in mass migration of people from rural areas to urban areas resulting in high-profile skyscrapers in Asia and Europe. In Asia skyscrapers were constructed in [[India]], China, [[Thailand]], South Korea, and Japan.
*The [[Millennium Bridge, London]] officially known as the London Millennium Footbridge, is a steel suspension bridge for pedestrians crossing the [[River Thames]] in London, [[England]], linking Bankside with the City. Londoners nicknamed the bridge the "Wobbly Bridge" after participants in a charity walk on behalf of Save the Children to open the bridge felt an unexpected, and, for some, uncomfortable, swaying motion on the first two days after the bridge opened. The bridge was closed later that day, and after two days of limited access the bridge was closed for almost two years while modifications were made to eliminate the wobble entirely. It was reopened in 2002.
*[[30 St Mary Axe]] (informally also known as "the Gherkin" and previously the Swiss Re Building) is a skyscraper in London's financial district, the City of London, completed in December 2003 and opened at the end of May 2004. The building has become an iconic symbol of London and is one of the city's most widely recognised examples of modern architecture.
*[[Wembley Stadium]] is a football stadium located in [[Wembley Park]], in the Borough of Brent, London, [[England]]. It opened in 2007 and was built on the site of the previous 1923 Wembley Stadium. The earlier Wembley stadium, originally called the Empire Stadium, was often referred to as "The Twin Towers" and was one of the world's most famous football stadia until its demolition in 2003.
* A major redevelopment of London's [[Trafalgar Square]] led by [[WS Atkins]] with [[Foster and Partners]] as sub-consultants was completed in 2003. The work involved closing the main eastbound road along the north side, diverting the traffic around the other three sides of the square, demolishing the central section of the northern retaining wall and inserting a wide set of steps leading up to a pedestrianised terrace in front of the National Gallery. The construction includes two lifts for disabled access, public toilets, and a small café. Previously, access between the square and the Gallery was by two crossings at the northeast and northwest corners of the square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transformation of Trafalgar Square|publisher=Foster+Partners|url=http://www.fosterandpartners.com/News/110/Default.aspx|accessdate=April 5, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214035327/http://www.fosterandpartners.com/News/110/Default.aspx|archivedate=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Hockney–Falco thesis]] is a controversial theory of [[art history]], advanced by artist [[David Hockney]] and physicist [[Charles M. Falco]], suggesting that advances in [[realism (visual arts)|realism]] and accuracy in the history of Western art since the [[Renaissance]] were primarily the result of [[optical aids]] such as the [[camera obscura]], [[camera lucida]], and [[curved mirror]]s, rather than solely due the development of [[artist]]ic technique and skill. In a 2001 book, ''Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters'', Hockney analyzed the work of the [[Old Masters]] and argued that the level of accuracy represented in their work is impossible to create by "eyeballing it". Since then, Hockney and Falco have produced a number of publications on positive evidence of the use of optical aids, and the historical plausibility of such methods.

[[File:Eminem_DJ_Hero.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eminem]] is considered one of the most successful artists of the decade. He sold 32 million albums and won multiple awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in [[75th Academy Awards|2002]].]]
In the 2000s, the Internet allowed consumers unprecedented access to music. The Internet also allowed more artists to distribute music relatively inexpensively and independently without the previously necessary financial support of a record label. Music sales began to decline following the year 2000, a state of affairs generally attributed to unlicensed uploading and downloading of sound files to the Internet, a practice which became more widely prevalent during this time. Business relationships called [[360 deal]]s—an arrangement in which a company provides support for an artist, and, in exchange, the artist pays the company a percentage of revenue earned not only from sales of recorded music, but also live performances and publishing—became a popular response by record labels to the loss of music sales attributed to online copyright infringement.

In [[Alternative rock]], the [[garage rock revival]] and [[Post-punk revival]] entered the mainstream, with bands such as [[The Strokes]], [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]], [[The Killers]], [[Arctic Monkeys]] and [[The White Stripes]] seeing commercial success. Other genres such as [[post-grunge]], [[post-Britpop]], [[nu metal]], [[pop punk]], [[post-hardcore]], [[metalcore]], and, in particular, [[emo rock]], also achieved notability during the decade.

The 2000s gave rise a new trend in popular music in the proliferation of [[Auto-Tune]]. In the early 2000s, Auto-Tune had been common with artists such as *NSYNC and Eiffel 65.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt; Towards the end of the decade, electronic dance music began to dominate western charts (as it would proceed to in the following decade), and in turn helped contribute to a diminishing amount of rock music in the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/23/showbiz/music/nirvana-nevermind/index.html|title='Nevermind,' never again?|work=CNN|date=September 23, 2011|accessdate=October 27, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102005827/http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/23/showbiz/music/nirvana-nevermind/index.html|archivedate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/5978573/La-Roux-Lady-Gaga-Mika-Little-Boots-the-80s-are-back.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Neil|last=McCormick|title=La Roux, Lady Gaga, Mika, Little Boots: the 80s are back|date=August 5, 2009|deadurl=no|accessdate=February 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027012310/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/5978573/La-Roux-Lady-Gaga-Mika-Little-Boots-the-80s-are-back.html|archivedate=2013-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hip hop music]] also saw a decline in the mainstream in the late 2000s because of electronic music's rising popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/nov/26/notes-noughties-hip-hop|work=The Guardian|location=London| title=Simon Reynolds's Notes on the noughties: When will hip-hop hurry up and die?| date=November 26, 2009|first1=Simon|last1=Reynolds|deadurl=no|accessdate=February 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411211603/http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2009/nov/26/notes-noughties-hip-hop|archivedate=2012-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grime (music)|Grime]] is a style of music that emerged from Bow, [[East London]], [[England]] in the early 2000s, primarily as a development of UK garage, [[drum &amp; bass]], [[hip hop]] and dancehall. Pioneers of the style include English rappers [[Dizzee Rascal]], Wiley, [[Roll Deep]] and [[Skepta]].

Michael Jackson's final album, ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]'', released on October 30, 2001, and costing $30m to record, was the most expensive record ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Branigan|first=Tania|title=Jackson spends £20m to be Invincible|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/sep/08/taniabranigan|accessdate=February 16, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=September 8, 2001|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116044622/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/sep/08/taniabranigan|archivedate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general socio-political fallout of [[Iraq War]] also extended to popular music. In July 2002, the release of English musician [[George Michael]]'s song "[[Shoot the Dog]]" proved to be controversial. It was critical of [[George W. Bush]] and [[Tony Blair]] in the lead up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. The video showed a cartoon version of Michael astride a nuclear missile in the Middle East and Tony and [[Cherie Blair]] in bed with President Bush. The [[Dixie Chicks]] are an American country music band. During a [[London]] concert ten days before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], lead vocalist Maines said, "we don't want this war, this violence, and we're ashamed that the President of the United States &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[George W.

[[Live 8]] was a string of [[benefit concert]]s that took place on 2 July 2005, in the [[G8]] states and in South Africa. They were timed to precede the G8 conference and [[31st G8 summit|summit]] held at the [[Gleneagles Hotel]] in [[Auchterarder]], Scotland from 6–8 July 2005; they also coincided with the 20th anniversary of [[Live Aid]]. Run in support of the aims of the UK's [[Make Poverty History]] campaign and the Global Call for Action Against Poverty, ten simultaneous concerts were held on 2 July and one on 6 July. On 7 July, the G8 leaders pledged to double 2004 levels of aid to poor nations from US$25 billion to US$50&amp;nbsp;billion by the year 2010. Half of the money was to go to Africa. More than 1,000 musicians performed at the concerts, which were broadcast on 182 television networks and 2,000 radio networks.&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/cpress/20050623/ca_pr_on_en/music_live_8_cda_10] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, the [[Rolling Stones]]' '[[A Bigger Bang]]' tour was declared the highest-grossing tour of all time, earning $437 million.

In December 2009, a campaign was launched on [[Facebook]] by [[Jon and Tracy Morter]], from [[South Woodham Ferrers]], which generated publicity in the UK and took the 1992 [[Rage Against The Machine]] track "[[Killing in the Name]]" to the [[Christmas Number One]] slot in the [[UK Singles Chart]], which had been occupied the four consecutive years from 2005 by winners from the TV show [[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]. Rage's [[Zack de la Rocha]] spoke to [[BBC1]] upon hearing the news, stating that:

"...We want to thank everyone that participated in this incredible, organic, grass-roots campaign. It says more about the spontaneous action taken by young people throughout the UK to topple this very sterile pop monopoly."

The world of video games reached the [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|6th generation]] of video game consoles including the [[PlayStation 2]], the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], and the [[GameCube]] which started technically in 1998 with the release of Sega's [[Dreamcast]], although some consider the true start in 2000 with the release of Sony's PlayStation 2. The 6th gen remained popular throughout the decade, but decreased somewhat in popularity after its 7th gen successors released technically starting in November 2005 with the release of Microsoft's Xbox 360, however, most people agree that 2006 is a 6th gen year since most games being released still released on 6th gen including the Xbox even though the 360 was already released, and the PlayStation 3 and the Wii didn't release until late 2006 which most people consider to be the true start of the 7th gen. It reached [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|7th Generation]] in the form of [[video game console|consoles]] like the [[Wii]], the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] by the mid-2000s. The number-one-selling game console of the decade, the [[PlayStation 2]], was released in 2000 and remained popular up to the end of the decade, even after the [[PlayStation 3]] was released. The [[PlayStation 2]] was discontinued in January 2013. [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPGs]], originating in the mid-to-late 1990s, become a popular PC trend and virtual online worlds become a reality as games such as ''[[RuneScape]]'' (2001), ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' (2002), ''[[Eve Online]]'' (2003), ''[[Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided]]'' (2003), ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' (2004), and ''[[Everquest II]]'' (2004), ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]'' (2007) and ''[[Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning]]'' (2008) are released. These worlds come complete with their own economies and social organization as directed by the players as a whole. The persistent online worlds allow the games to remain popular for many years. ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', premiered in 2004, remains one of the most popular games in PC gaming and is still being developed into the 2010s.

The ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series sparked a fad of Mature-rated video games based on including gang warfare, drug use, and perceived "senseless violence" into gameplay. Though violent video games date back to the early 1990s, they became much more common after 2000. Despite the controversy, the 2004 game ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' became the best selling [[PlayStation 2]] game of all time, with 17.33 million copies sold for that console alone, from a total of 21.5 million in all formats by 2009;&lt;ref name="guinness 2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2009 Gamer's Edition|pages=108–109|isbn=1904994458|quote=''GTA: San Andreas'' is the best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time, with a massive 17.33 million copies sold.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as of 2011, 27.5 million copies of ''San Andreas'' were sold worldwide.&lt;ref name="2011sales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5840484/gta-iv-overtakes-san-andreas-in-lifetime-sales|title=GTA IV Overtakes San Andreas in Lifetime Sales [Correction]|publisher=Kotaku|first=Owen|last=Good|date=15 September 2011|accessdate=12 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701162931/http://kotaku.com/5840484/gta-iv-overtakes-san-andreas-in-lifetime-sales|archivedate=1 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Call of Duty]] series was extremely popular during the 2000s, the diverse shooter franchise released multiple games throughout the 2000s that were positively critically reviewed and commercially successful.

''[[Gears of War (series)|Gears of War]]'' was a critically acclaimed and commercially successful [[third-person shooter]] franchise that released two games during the mid-late 2000s. [[Gears of War|Gears of War 1]] was released in 2006 and was the first installment to the franchise, it was universally critically acclaimed and went on to sell over 5 million copies. The second installment to the franchise ''[[Gears of War 2]]'' was released in 2008 and received widespread critical acclaim and also went on to sell over 5 million copies.

October 29, 2007 – ''[[Manhunt 2]]'' – a controversial stealth-based [[psychological horror]] [[video game]] published by [[Rockstar Games]] was suspended by [[Take-Two Interactive]] (Rockstar's parent company) when it was refused classification in the United Kingdom, Italy and Ireland, and given an Adults Only (AO) rating in the United States. As neither [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]] nor [[Nintendo]] allow AO titles on their systems, this effectively meant the game was banned in the US.

The sixth generation sparked a rise in first person shooter games led by ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'', which changed the formula of the first person shooter. ''[[Halo 2]]'' started [[online console gaming]] and was on top of the [[Xbox Live]] charts until its successor, ''[[Halo 3]]'' (for Xbox 360), took over. Some other popular first-person shooters during the 2000s include the [[Medal of Honor]] series, with ''[[Medal of Honor: Frontline]]''{{'}}s release in 2002 bringing the first game in the series to 6th generation consoles.

In the late 2000s, motion controlled video games grew in popularity, from the PlayStation 2's [[EyeToy]] to Nintendo's successful [[Wii]] console. During the decade 3D video games become the staple of the video-game industry, with 2D games nearly fading from the market. Partially 3D and fully 2D games were still common in the industry early in the decade, but these have now become rare as developers look almost exclusively for fully 3D games to satisfy the increasing demand for them in the market. An exception to this trend is the indie gaming community, which often produces games featuring 'old-school' or retro gaming elements, such as [[Minecraft]] and [[Shadow Complex]]. These games, which are not developed by the industry giants, are often available in the form of downloadable content from services such as [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox Live]] or Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and usually cost much less than more major releases.

''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' was released in Japan and later the United States, where it became immensely popular among teenagers. Another music game, ''[[Guitar Hero]]'', was released in North America in 2005 and [[Cultural impact of the Guitar Hero series|had a huge cultural impact]] on both the music and video games industries. It became a worldwide billion-dollar franchise within three years, spawning several sequels and leading to the creation of a competing franchise, ''Rock Band''.

Japanese media giant [[Nintendo]] released 9 out of the 10 top selling games of the 2000s, further establishing the company's dominance over the market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://top-10er.blogspot.com/2010/03/top-10-best-selling-video-games-2000.html Blogspot.com]

[[Cartoon Network]] also released its "biggest game ever" on January 19, 2009, known as ''[[Cartoon Network Universe: FusionFall]]''. The game is an MMO and was originally set to be released in fall 2008. {{cite web|url=http://top-10er.blogspot.com/2010/03/top-10-best-selling-video-games-2000.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2016-02-06|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316124732/http://top-10er.blogspot.com/2010/03/top-10-best-selling-video-games-2000.html|archivedate=March 16, 2012|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arcade game|Arcade video games]] had declined in popularity so much by the late 1990s, that revenues in the United States dropped to $1.33 billion in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Henry|first=Lydia|title=Skee-ball Mania|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZFsxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0aIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5114,5262090|accessdate=March 13, 2012|newspaper=[[Reading Eagle]]|date=April 26, 2001|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached a low of $866 million in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Video killed the arcade star|url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/article_9b22d9ea-1810-5465-8bd9-a4e3204de569.html?mode=story|accessdate=7 March 2012|newspaper=[[East Valley Tribune]]|date=April 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, by the early 2000s, networked gaming via computers and then consoles across the Internet had also appeared,&lt;ref name="online games"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mabry|first=Donald J.|title=Evolution of Online Games|url=http://www.historicaltextarchive.com/s/online-games.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209100942/http://www.historicaltextarchive.com/s/online-games.php|archivedate=February 9, 2008|accessdate=September 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the venue of head-to-head competition and social atmosphere once provided solely by arcades.&lt;ref name="socialarcades"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fuller|first=Brad|title=Awakening the Arcade|url=http://blogs.oreilly.com/digitalmedia/2005/11/awakening-the-arcade.html|accessdate=September 21, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003012240/http://blogs.oreilly.com/digitalmedia/2005/11/awakening-the-arcade.html|archive-date=October 3, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arcades also lost their status as the forefront of new game releases.

Worldwide, arcade game revenues gradually increased from $1.8 billion in 1998 to $3.2 billion in 2002, rivalling [[PC game]] sales of $3.2 billion that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chou|first=Yuntsai|title=G-commerce in East Asia: Evidence and Prospects|journal=Journal of Interactive Advertising|date=Fall 2003|volume=4|issue=1|url=http://jiad.org/article43|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202021753/http://jiad.org/article43|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 2, 2008|accessdate=January 31, 2012|ref=harv|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, arcade video games are a thriving [[Video gaming in the People's Republic of China|industry in China]], where arcades are widespread across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jou|first=Eric|title=The Wonderful and Seedy World of Chinese Arcades|url=http://kotaku.com/5894415/the-wonderful-and-seedy-world-of-chinese-arcades/gallery/1|website=Kotaku|accessdate=April 9, 2012|date=March 19, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308130752/http://kotaku.com/5894415/the-wonderful-and-seedy-world-of-chinese-arcades/gallery/1/|archivedate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US market has also experienced a slight resurgence, with the number of video game arcades across the nation increasing from 2,500 in 2003 to 3,500 in 2008, though this is significantly less than the 10,000 arcades in the early 1980s.

[[Sega Corporation]], usually styled as '''SEGA''', is a Japanese [[multinational corporation|multinational]] video game software developer and an [[arcade game|arcade software]] and [[Video game arcade cabinet|hardware]] development company headquartered in [[Japan]], with various offices around the world. Sega previously developed and manufactured its own brand of [[video game console|home video game consoles]] from 1983 to 2001, but a restructure was announced on January 31, 2001, that ceased continued production of its existing home console, effectively exiting the company from the home console business.&lt;ref name="SegaRestructure"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sega announces drastic restructuring|author=Shahed Ahmed|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2680518.html|date=January 31, 2001|accessdate=September 20, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914162404/http://www.gamespot.com/news/2680518.html|archivedate=September 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2008 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony 2.jpg|thumb|The opening ceremony of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], held in Beijing, China.]]
The [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney Games]], held in 2000, followed the hundredth anniversary of the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996. The [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens Games]], in 2004, were also a strong symbol, for modern Olympic Games were inspired by the competitions organized in [[Ancient Greece]]. Finally, the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing Games]] saw the emergence of China as a major sports power, with the highest number of titles for the first time. The [[2002 Winter Games|2002 Salt Lake City]] and the [[2006 Winter Games|2006 Turin]] Winter Olympic Games were also major events, though slightly less popular.

A number of [[concerns and controversies over the 2008 Summer Olympics]] surfaced before, during, and after the 2008 Summer Olympic games, and which received major media coverage. Leading up to the Olympics, there were concerns about human rights in China, such that many high-profile individuals, such as politicians and celebrities, announced intentions to boycott the games to protest China's role in the Darfur conflict, and Myanmar, its stance towards Tibet, or other aspects of its human rights record.

In a 2008 [[TIME magazine|''TIME'' magazine]] article entitled "Why Nobody's Boycotting Beijing", Vivienne Walt wrote:
'Leaders in power are more mindful of China's colossal clout in an increasingly shaky world economy, and therefore of the importance of keeping good relations with its government.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walt|first=Vivienne|title=Why Nobody's Boycotting Beijing|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1823561,00.html#ixzz24s9hkjgN|publisher=Time Inc.|deadurl=no|accessdate=February 11, 2013|date=July 16, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822212632/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1823561%2C00.html|archivedate=August 22, 2013|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most prominent events of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] held in Beijing was the achievement of [[Michael Phelps]] the American swimmer, frequently cited as the greatest swimmer and one of the greatest Olympians of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=5 things we learned about Michael Phelps|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/swimming/news/newsid=229303.html|author=Pamela Barone|date=August 17, 2008|accessdate=July 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103052144/http://www.nbcolympics.com/swimming/news/newsid%3D229303.html|archivedate=November 3, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phelps officially world's greatest athlete ever|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26194188|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|author=Mike Celizic|date=August 16, 2008|accessdate=July 30, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604041119/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26194188|archivedate=2011-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's over, there are no arguments ...

As of August 2, 2009, Phelps has broken thirty-seven [[List of world records in swimming|world records in swimming]]. Phelps holds the record for the most gold medals won in a single Olympics, his eight at the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Games]] surpassed American swimmer [[Mark Spitz]]'s seven-gold performance at [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich]] in 1972.

[[Usain Bolt]] of [[Jamaica]] dominated the male sprinting events at the Beijing Olympics, in which he broke three world records, allowing him to be the first man to ever accomplish this at a single Olympic game. He holds the world record for the 100&amp;nbsp;metres (despite slowing down before the finish line to celebrate), the 200&amp;nbsp;metres and, along with his teammates, the 4 × 100 metres relay.

The rise of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] and the decline of the [[WWE]] started to bring wrestling fans away from [[wrestling]], as they claimed that wrestling was not real and was only for entertainment; resulting in them switching to [[mixed martial arts]].

In 2001, after the [[9/11 attacks]], both the [[National Football League]] and [[Major League Baseball]] canceled their upcoming games for a week. As a result, the [[2001 World Series|World Series]] would be played in November for the first time and the [[Super Bowl XXXVI|Super Bowl]] would be played in February for the first time.

The sport of [[fox hunting]] is controversial, particularly in the UK, where it was banned in [[Scotland]] in 2002, and in [[England and Wales]] in November 2004 (law enforced from February 2005), though shooting foxes as vermin remained legal.

Ron Atkinson, is an English former football player and manager. In recent years he has become one of Britain's best-known football pundits.
Ron Atkinson's media work came to an abrupt halt on 21 April 2004, when he was urged to resign from [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] by Brian Barwick after he broadcast a [[Racism|racial]] remark live on air about the [[Black people|black]] [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] player [[Marcel Desailly]]; believing the microphone to be switched off, he said, ''"...he'' [Desailly] ''is what is known in some schools as a lazy [[nigger]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Association football's important events included two World Cups, one organized in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|South Korea and Japan]], which saw Brazil win a record fifth title, and the other in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|Germany]], which saw Italy win its fourth title. The regional competitions, the [[Copa América]] and [[UEFA European Championship]], saw five nations rising the cup: Colombia (2001) and Brazil (2004, 2007) won the Copa América, while France (2000), Greece (2004) and Spain (2008) won the European Championship.

[[Rugby football|Rugby]] increased in size and audience, as the [[Rugby World Cup]] became the third most watched sporting event in the world with the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] organized in France.

[[Bloodgate]] is the nickname for a rugby union scandal involving the English team Harlequins in their Heineken Cup match against the Irish side Leinster on 12 April 2009. It was so called because of the use of fake blood capsules, and has been seen by some as one of the biggest scandals in rugby since professionalisation in the mid-1990s, indeed even as an argument against the professional ethos. The name is a pun on Watergate.

The [[New York Yankees]] won the first [[Major League Baseball]] [[World Series]] of the decade in 2000, as well as the last World Series of the decade in 2009. The [[Boston Red Sox]] won their first [[World Series]] since 1918 in 2004 and then again in 2007.

The [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] won a record sixth Super Bowl on February 1, 2009, against the [[Arizona Cardinals]].

In September 2004, [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] footballer [[Adrian Mutu]] failed a drugs test for cocaine and was released on 29 October 2004. He also received a seven-month ban and a £20,000 fine from [[The Football Association]].

[[Michael Schumacher]], the most titled F1 driver, won five [[F1 World Championship]]s during the decade and finally retired in 2006, yet eventually confirming his come-back to F1 for 2010. [[Lance Armstrong]] won all the [[Tour de France]] between 1999 and 2005, also an all-time record, but was later stripped of all his titles when evidence emerged of his use of performance-enhancing drugs. Swiss tennis player [[Roger Federer]] won 16 [[Grand Slam title]]s to become the most titled player.

The [[2006 Italian football scandal]], also known as "''Calciopoli''", involved Italy's top professional football leagues, [[Serie A]] and [[Serie B]]. The scandal was uncovered in May 2006 by Italian police, implicating league champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], and other major teams including [[A.C. Milan]], [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] and [[Urbs Sportiva Reggina 1914|Reggina]] when a number of telephone interceptions showed a thick network of relations between team managers and referee organisations. Juventus were the champions of Serie A at the time. The teams have been accused of rigging games by selecting favourable referees.

The [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final]] in Berlin, [[Zinedine Zidane]] widely considered by experts and fans as one of the greatest football players of all time, was sent off in the 110th minute of the game, which was to be the last match of his career. After headbutting [[Marco Materazzi]] in the chest, Zidane did not participate in the penalty shootout, which Italy won 5–3. It was later discovered through interviews that Materazzi had insulted Zidane's mother and sister that last moment which is what led to Zidane's heightened anger and reaction.

British [[Formula One]] racing driver [[Lewis Hamilton]], was disqualified from the [[2009 Australian Grand Prix]] for providing "misleading evidence" during the stewards' hearing. He later privately apologised to FIA race director Charlie Whiting for having lied to the stewards.

In 2009, the [[World football transfer record]] was set by Spanish football club [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] when it purchased [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] for [[Pound sterling|£]]80&amp;nbsp;million ([[Euro|€]]93&amp;nbsp;million). Manchester United veteran [[Bobby Charlton|Sir Bobby Charlton]] said the world-record offer shocked him:

'''Abbas Malekzadeh Milani''' ({{lang-fa|عباس ملک‌زاده میلانی}}; born 1949) is an [[Iranian-American]] [[historian]] and [[author]].  Milani is a visiting [[professor]] of [[Political Science]] and the director of the [[Iranian Studies]] program at [[Stanford University]].  He is also a [[research fellow]] and co-director of the [[Iran Democracy Project]] at [[Stanford University]]'s [[Hoover Institution]]. Milani has found evidence that Persian [[modernism]] dates back to more than 1000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Milani, Abbas|title=Lost Wisdom: Rethinking Modernity in Iran|year=2004|publisher=Mage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Milani was born in Iran to a prosperous family and was sent to [[California]] when he was sixteen, graduating from [[Oakland Technical High School]] in 1966 after only one year of studies.&lt;ref name=SFGate2005/&gt; Milani earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in political science and [[economics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/~amilani/CV.html Official Curriculum Vitae of Abbas Milani] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130113202/http://www.stanford.edu/~amilani/CV.html |date=November 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1970 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in political science from the [[University of Hawaii]] in 1974.

With his girlfriend Fereshteh, Milani returned to Iran to serve as an assistant professor of political science at the [[Shahid Beheshti University|National University of Iran]] from 1975 to 1977.&lt;ref name=SFGate2005/&gt; He lectured on [[Marxism|Marxist]] themes veiled in metaphor but was jailed for two years as a [[political prisoner]] for "activities against the government".&lt;ref name=SFGate2005&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/11/11/PNGVAFIL7Q1.DTL ''San Francisco Chronicle'' Profile of Milani]&lt;/ref&gt; He was a research fellow at the [[Iranian Center for Social Research]] from 1977 to 1978. He was also an assistant professor of [[law]] and political science at the [[University of Tehran]] and a member of the board of directors of Tehran University's Center for International Studies from 1979 to 1986, but after the [[Iranian Revolution]] he was not allowed to publish or teach.&lt;ref name=SFGate2005/&gt; With his son Hamid and his wife Fereshteh, he left Iran in 1986.&lt;ref name=SFGate2005/&gt;

According to Wikileaks documents, Abbas Milani was arrested and later pardoned on Shah's Birthday;&lt;ref&gt;https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1977TEHRAN09431_c.html&lt;/ref&gt; however, Abbas Milani's wife was never arrested as it is indicated in the cable from the embassy.&lt;ref&gt;https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1977TEHRAN08544_c.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to California, Milani was appointed professor of [[History]] and Political Science as well as chair of the department at [[Notre Dame de Namur University]] in [[Belmont, California|Belmont]], south of [[San Francisco]]. He served as a research fellow at the Institute of International Studies at UC Berkeley. Milani became a [[Hoover Institution]] research fellow in 2001 and left Notre Dame de Namur for Stanford in 2002.&lt;ref name=SFGate2005/&gt;

He is currently the Hamid and Christina Moghadam Director of Iranian Studies at Stanford. He lives on campus with his second wife, Jean Nyland, who is chair of Notre Dame de Namur's psychology department.&lt;ref name=SFGate2005/&gt;

'''Afrocentrism''' (also '''Afrocentricity''') is an approach to the study of world history that focuses on the history of people of recent{{what|date=November 2018}} [[Africa]]n descent. It is in some respects a response to global ([[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]]) attitudes about [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African people]] and their historical contributions; it seeks to correct mistakes and ideas perpetuated by the racist philosophical underpinnings of western academic disciplines as they developed during and since Europe's Early Renaissance as justifying rationales for the enslavement of other peoples, in order to enable more accurate accounts of not only African but all people's contributions to world history.&lt;ref&gt;CC Verharen, “Molefi Asante...”, The Western Journal of Black Studies, (24)4, 2000, pp. 223-238&lt;/ref&gt;  Afrocentricity deals primarily with [[self-determination]] and African agency and is a [[Pan-African]] point of view for the study of culture, [[philosophy]], and history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asante.net/articles/1/afrocentricity/ Asante on Afrocentricity].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Africana"&gt;[[Henry Louis Gates|Gates, Henry Louis]], and [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] (eds), ''[[Encyclopedia Africana|Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African-American]]'' Volume 1, p. 111, Oxford University Press. 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-517055-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afrocentrism is a scholarly movement that seeks to conduct research and education on global history subjects, from the perspective of historical African peoples and polities. It takes a critical stance on Euro-centric assumptions and myths about world history, in order to pursue methodological studies of the latter. Some of the critics of the movement believe that it often denies or minimizes European, [[Near East]]ern and [[Asian culture|Asian]] cultural influences while exagerating certain aspects of historical African civilizations that independently accomplished a significant level of cultural and technological development. In general, Afrocentrism is usually manifested in a focus on the history of [[Africa]] and its role in contemporary African-American culture and Greek philosophy among others.

What is today broadly called Afrocentrism evolved out of the work of African-American intellectuals in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but flowered into its modern form due to the activism of African-American intellectuals in the U.S. Civil Rights Movement and in the development of African-American Studies programs in universities. However, following the development of universities in African colonies in the 1950s, African scholars became major contributors to African historiography.&lt;ref&gt;General History of Africa, Vol 1, p41, UNESCO, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; A notable pioneer is the professor [[Kenneth Dike]] of the [[University of Ibadan]], who became chairman of the Committee on African Studies at Harvard in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/obituaries/kenneth-o-dike-dies-in-a-nigerian-hospital.html&lt;/ref&gt;  In strict terms Afrocentrism, as a distinct historiography, reached its peak in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="nathanielturner1"&gt;[http://www.nathanielturner.com/twoscholarsdiscussafrocentrism.htm Wilson J. Moses: Historical Sketches of Afrocentrism].&lt;/ref&gt; Today{{when|date=December 2017}} it is primarily associated with [[Cheikh Anta Diop]], [[John Henrik Clarke]], [[Ivan van Sertima]] and [[Molefi Asante]].&lt;ref&gt;Molefi Asante, ''The Painful Demise of Eurocentrism: An Afrocentric Response to Critics'', foreword by [[Maulana Karenga]]: "Molefi Asante, the founding and preeminent theorist of Afrocentricity, is one of the most important intellectuals at work today. This work continues his tradition of combining an extraordinary intellectual range with an impressive ability to identify and clarify central issues in the current discourse on Afrocentricity, multiculturalism, race, culture, ethnicity and related themes. Dr. Asante offers an insightful and valuable response to Eurocentric critics of the Afrocentric initiative while simultaneously addressing a wide range of issues critical to understanding this important intellectual enterprise, including African agency, location, orientation, centerdness, subject-place and cultural groundedness.

Afrocentrists led by Molefe Asante have organised their critics into three categories, Capitulationists, Europeanised Loyalists, and Maskers. 

&lt;blockquote&gt; "Capitulationists condemn Afrocentricity because they are uncomfortable with themselves and do not believe that Africans should be considered agents. They include amongst black scholars Anthony Appiah and Stanley Crouch. The functioning element for these critics is self-hatred, accompanied by the belief that these African critics are really nothing but whites in black skin. Their rejection of Afrocentricity is tied to their rejection of themselves. Europeanised Loyalists include many Marxists and integrationists such as Mary Lefkowitz, Stanley Crouch, and Wilson Moses (staunch critics of Afrocentricity), who believe that blacks can do no good. These critics are strangers to the Afrocentric idea because they have immersed themselves in alien canon of knowledge without knowing African history. The last type, the Maskers, are the critics who are ashamed of Afrocentricity and therefore do all they can to conceal their identities. Their tragedy is that they seek to please the master so they attack Afrocentrists to prove to whites that they are like them. They fear that they may lose their careers"&lt;ref&gt;MK Asante, Afrocentricity: The theory of social change..., p. 7; MK Asante&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Afrocentricity and its critics…” (available at http://science.jrank.org/pages/8216/Afrocentricity-Afrocentricity-Its-Critics.html, as accessed on 2 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Afrocentrism has its origins in the work of [[Africa]]n and [[African diaspora]] intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, following social changes in the United States and Africa due both to the end of [[slavery]] and the decline of [[colonialism]]. Following the [[American Civil War]], African Americans in the [[Southern United States|South]] gathered together in communities to evade white control, established their own church congregations, and worked hard to gain education. They increasingly took more active public roles despite severe racial discrimination and segregation.&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois, W. E. B., ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880''.

In 1987, [[Martin Bernal]] published his ''[[Black Athena]]'', in which he claims that ancient Greece was colonized by northern invaders mixing with a colony established by [[Phoenicia]] (modern Lebanon). A major theme of the work is the alleged denial by Western academia of the African and (western) Asiatic influence on ancient Greek culture.

==Aspects==

===Afrocentricity book===
{{main|Afrocentricity (book)}}
In 2000, [[Molefi Kete Asante]], chair of the Department of African American Studies at [[Temple University]] gave a lecture at the [[University of Liverpool]] entitled "Afrocentricity: Toward a New Understanding of African Thought in this Millennium,"&lt;ref&gt;Kete Asante, Molefi, [http://www.asante.net/articles/Liverpool-Address.html "Afrocentricity: Toward a New Understanding of African Thought in this Millennium"], University of Liverpool, 2 August 2000, accessed 11 February 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302025412/http://www.asante.net/articles/Liverpool-Address.html |date=2 March 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he presented many of his ideas:
* Africa has been betrayed by international commerce, by [[missionaries]] and [[imams]], by the structure of knowledge imposed by the Western world, by its own leaders, and by the ignorance of its own people of its past.
* [[Philosophy]] originated in Africa and the first philosophers in the world were Africans.
* Afrocentricity constitutes a new way of examining data, and a novel orientation to data; it carries with it assumptions about the current state of the African world.
* His aim is "to help lay out a plan for the recovery of African place, respectability, accountability, and leadership."
* Afrocentricity can stand its ground among any ideology or religion: Marxism, [[Islam]], Christianity, Buddhism, or [[Judaism]]. Your Afrocentricity will emerge in the presence of these other ideologies because it is from you.
* Afrocentrism is the only ideology that can liberate African people.

Asante also stated:
{{quote|As a cultural configuration, the Afrocentric idea is distinguished by five characteristics:
# an intense interest in psychological location as determined by symbols, motifs, rituals, and signs.
# a commitment to finding the subject-place of Africans in any social, political, economic, or religious phenomenon with implications for questions of sex, gender, and class.
# a defence of African cultural elements as historically valid in the context of art, music, and literature.
# a celebration of centeredness and agency and a commitment to lexical refinement that eliminates pejoratives about Africans or other people.
# a powerful imperative from historical sources to revise the collective text of African people.}}
However, Wilson J. Moses, said of Asante: "His second book, ''The Afrocentric Idea'' (1987), was a creative and in some respects brilliant but rambling theoretical work, much influenced by the revolution in "[[critical theory]]" that occurred in American intellectual life during the late 1970s and early 1980s."&lt;ref name="nathanielturner1"/&gt; Some also assert that the definition of Afrocentricity has never sat still long enough to be properly described and accurately critiqued.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Afrocentric education===
{{Main|Afrocentric education}}
Afrocentric education is education designed to empower peoples of the African diaspora. A central premise behind it is that many Africans have been subjugated by limiting their awareness of themselves and indoctrinating them with ideas that work against them.&lt;ref&gt;Woodson, Dr. Carter G. (1933). ''The Mis-Education of the Negro''. Khalifah's Booksellers &amp; Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; To control a people's culture is to control their tools of self-determination in relationship to others.&lt;ref&gt;Akbar, Dr. Na'im (1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Paulo Freire|educational leaders of other cultures]], proponents assert that what educates one group of people does not necessarily educate and empower another group–so they assert educational priorities distinctly for the Africans in a given context.

===Afrocentric theology===
{{Further|Black theology|Black church}}
The [[black church]] in the United States developed out of the [[creolization]] of African spirituality and European-American [[Christianity]]; early members of the churches made certain stories their own{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. During the [[American Civil War|antebellum]] years, the idea of deliverance out of [[slavery]], as in the story of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], was especially important{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. After [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and the restoration of white supremacy, their hope was based on deliverance from segregation and other abuses{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. They found much to respond to in the idea of a personal relationship with [[Jesus]], and shaped their churches by the growth of music and worship styles that related to African as well as European-American traditions.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Twentieth-century "Africentric approaches" to Christian [[theology]] and preaching have been more deliberate. Writers and thinkers emphasize "Black presence" in the [[Christian Bible]], including the idea of a "[[Race of Jesus|Black Jesus]]".&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Ronald Edward (ed.), ''Africentric Approaches to Christian Ministry: Strengthening Urban Congregations in African American Communities'', University Press of America (2006), {{ISBN|978-0-7618-3264-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}

===Race and Pan-African identity===

Afrocentrists have condemned what they consider to be attempts at dividing African peoples into racial clusters as new versions of discredited theories, such as the [[Hamitic#Hamitic hypothesis|Hamitic hypothesis]] and the [[Dynastic Race Theory]]. These theories, they contend, attempted to identify certain African ethnicities, such as Nubians, Ethiopians and Somalis, as "Caucasoid" groups that entered Africa to bring civilization to the natives. They believe that Western academics have traditionally limited the peoples they defined as "Black" Africans to those south of the [[Sahara]], but used broader "Caucasoid" or related categories to classify peoples of Egypt or North Africa. Afrocentrists also believe strongly in the work of certain anthropologists who have suggested that there is little evidence to support that the first North African populations were closely related to "Caucasoids" of Europe and western Asia.&lt;ref name="Hiernaux"/&gt;

In 1964 Afrocentric scholar [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] expressed a belief in such a double standard:
{{quote|But it is only the most gratuitous theory that considers the Dinka, the Nouer and the Masai, among others, to be Caucasoids. What if an African ethnologist were to persist in recognising as white only the blond, blue-eyed Scandinavians, and systematically refused membership to the remaining Europeans, and Mediterraneans in particular—the French, Italians, Greek, Spanish, and Portuguese? Just as the inhabitants of Scandinavia and the Mediterranean countries must be considered as two extreme poles of the same anthropological reality, so should the Negroes of East and West Africa be considered as the two extremes in the reality of the Negro world. To say that a Shillouk, a Dinka, or a Nouer is a Caucasoid is for an African as devoid of sense and scientific interest as would be, to a European, an attitude that maintained that a Greek or a Latin were not of the same race.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}}}

French historian Jean Vercoutter has claimed that [[archaeological]] workers routinely classified Negroid remains as Mediterranean, even though they found such remains in substantial numbers with ancient artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Vercoutter, ''The Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering Meroitic Script''. Paris: UNESCO, 1978, pp. 15–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Afrocentrists{{Who|date=October 2015}} have adopted a [[Pan-Africanism|pan-Africanist]] perspective that people of color are all "African people" or "[[diaspora|diasporic]] Africans," citing physical characteristics they exhibit in common with Black Africans. Afrocentric scholar [[Runoko Rashidi]] writes that they are all part of the "global African community." Some Afrocentric writers include in the [[African diaspora]] the [[Dravidians]] of India, "[[Negrito]]s" of Southeast Asia ([[Thailand]], the [[Philippines]] and [[Malaysia]]); and the [[Indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] peoples of Australia and Melanesia.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

A few Afrocentrists{{Who|date=October 2015}} claim that the [[Olmecs]] of [[Mexico]] were a hybrid society of Native American peoples and Africans. Mainstream historians of Mesoamerica overwhelmingly reject that view with detailed rebuttals.&lt;ref name=Ortiz1997&gt;{{cite journal

===Pre-Columbian Africa-Americas theories===
{{Main|Pre-Columbian Africa-Americas contact theories}}
In the 1970s, [[Ivan van Sertima]] advanced the theory that the complex civilizations of the Americas were the result of trans-oceanic influence from the Egyptians or other African civilizations. Such a claim is his primary thesis in ''They Came Before Columbus'', published in 1978. The few [[Trans-cultural diffusion|hyper-diffusionist]] writers seek to establish that the [[Olmec]] people, who built the first highly complex civilization in [[Mesoamerica]] and are considered by some to be the mother civilization for all other civilizations of Mesoamerica, were deeply influenced by Africans. Van Sertima said that the Olmec civilization was a hybrid one of Africans and Native Americans. His theory of pre-Columbian American-African contact has since met with considerable and detailed opposition by scholars of Mesoamerica. Van Sertima has been accused of "doctoring" and twisting data to fit his conclusions, inventing evidence, and ignoring the work of respected Central and South American scholars in the advance of his own theory.&lt;ref name="Ortiz1997"/&gt;

===Afrocentrism and Ancient Egypt===

The claim has also been made by many Afrocentric scholars that the Ancient Egyptians themselves were [[Black African]] (sub-saharan African) rather than North African/Maghrebi, and that the various invasions on Egypt resulted in the Africanity of Ancient Egypt becoming diluted, resulting in the modern diversity seen today.&lt;ref name="Ivan van Sertima 1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Van Sertima, Ivan|title=Egypt, Child of Africa|authorlink=Ivan van Sertima|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7KmBTz2vUoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA2-IA1,M1|year=1994|isbn=1-56000-792-3 |accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}

Scholars have challenged the various assertions of Afrocentrists on the cultural and biological characteristics of Ancient Egyptian civilization and its people. At a [[UNESCO]] Symposium in the 1970s, the vast majority of the delegates repudiated the Afrocentric assertions.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, "Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic Script; Proceedings", (Paris, 1978), pp. 3–134.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zahi Hawass]] has gone on record as saying that the Ancient Egyptians were not black and Ancient Egypt was not a Black African Civilization.&lt;ref name="touregypt.net"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://touregypt.net/teblog/egyptologynews/?p=2929 |title=Egyptology News" Blog Archive " Hawass says that Tutankhamun was not black |publisher=Touregypt.net |date=2007-09-26 |accessdate=2009-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727185516/http://touregypt.net/teblog/egyptologynews/?p=2929 |archive-date=27 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite contestations, [[UNESCO]] decided to include his "Origin of the ancient Egyptians" in the General History of Africa, with an editorial comment mentioning the disagreement. 
It should also be noted that the ancient world did not employ racial categories such as "Black" or "White" as they had no conception of "race", but rather labeled groups according to their land of origin and cultural traits. However, [[S. O. Y. Keita]], a biological anthropologist studying the controversy, finds simplistic political appellations (in the negative or affirmative) describing ancient populations as "black" or "white" to be inaccurate and instead focuses on the ancestry of ancient Egypt as being a part of the native and diverse biological variation of Africa, which includes a variety of phenotypes and skin gradients.&lt;ref&gt;''Anthropology News'', December 2007, Vol. 48, No. 9, pp. 19-20, {{doi|10.1525/an.2007.48.9.19}}; see also "Forensic Misclassification of Ancient Nubian Crania: Implications for Assumptions About Human Variation", Frank L'Engle Williams, Robert L.

===Hamitic hypothesis===
Stephen Howe summarizes the development of the Hamitic hypothesis in the 19th and 20th centuries as Eurocentric. He further describes how some Afrocentric writers adopted 'their version' of it. Howe distinguishes three clusters of controversies related to the history of [[Ancient Egypt]].

Within Afrocentrism, claims were forwarded involving the contention that African civilizations were founding influences on such distant civilizations as the American [[Olmec]] and the Chinese [[Xia Dynasty|Xia]] cultures.&lt;ref name=Ortiz1997/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dcn.davis.ca.us/~gizmo/2001/clarence.html |title=Clarence Walker encourages black Americans to discard Afrocentrism |accessdate=2007-11-13 |last=Sherwin |first=Elisabeth |publisher=Davis Community Network | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071017065428/http://dcn.davis.ca.us/~gizmo/2001/clarence.html| archivedate= 17 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yaacov Shavit]], a critic of the movement, summarises its goals in the preface to his book ''[[History in Black]]'',&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Yaacov Shavit, ''History in Black: African-Americans in Search of an Ancient Past'', Frank Cass Publishers, 2001, pp. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; in which he states:
{{quote|Thus, if historical myths and legends, or an invented history, play such a major role in the founding of every national reconstruction, the question that should concern us here is the nature of the distinct style in which black Americans imagine their past. The answer to this question is that radical Afrocentrism, the subject of this study, which plays a central role in shaping the modern historical world-view of a large section of the African-American (or Afro-American) community, is far more than an effort to follow the line taken by many [[ethnic]] groups and nations in modern rewriting, inventing or developing collective identity and national history. Rather, it is a large-scale historical project to rewrite the history of the whole of humankind from an Afrocentric point of view. The result is a new reconstruction of world history: it is a universal history.}}

Other critics{{Who|date=October 2015}} contend that some Afrocentric historical research is grounded in [[identity politics]] and [[mythology|myth]] rather than scholarship.&lt;ref name="Lefkowitz1996"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Mary Lefkowitz]], Professor Emerita of Classical Studies at [[Wellesley College]] in Massachusetts, has rejected [[George James (writer)|George James]]'s theories about Egyptian contributions to Greek civilization as being faulty scholarship. She notes that he used sources that predated the deciphering of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. He failed to acknowledge that many of his theories were overturned by the evidence of later findings. She contends that ancient Egyptian texts show little similarity to Greek philosophy. Lefkowitz also pointed out that [[Aristotle]] could not have stolen his ideas from the great [[Library at Alexandria]] as James suggested, because the library was founded ''after'' Aristotle's death. Because of such fundamental errors of fact, Lefkowitz has criticized Afrocentrism as "an excuse to teach myth as history."&lt;ref name="Lefkowitz1996"/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}

In 1994 the Manhattan Institute, a public policy forum, published ''Alternatives to Afrocentrism'', a collection of highly critical essays by, among others, Lefkowitz, [[Gerald Early]], Stanley Crouch, Wilson Moses, and Frank Yurco. Early, an African American, has been especially critical and dismisses Afrocentrism as just another North American experiment in "group therapy," a kind of "intellectual fast food".{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In 2002 Ibrahim Sundiata noted in the ''[[American Historical Review]]'' that 
{{quote|The word "Afrocentric" has been traced by Derrick Alridge to the American historian W.E.B. Du Bois, who employed it in the early 1960s. During the 1970s, Molefi Kete Asante appropriated the term, insisting that he was the only person equipped to define it, and asserting that even the holy archangels Du Bois and [[Cheikh Anta Diop]] had an imperfect and immature grasp of a concept that finds ultimate expression in his own pontifications. Subsequently, it became a catchall "floating signifier," nebulous, unstable, and infinitely mutable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://way.net/dissonance/sundiata.html Ibrahim Sundiata, "The Argument We Are Really Having"], ''American Historical Review'', (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Cain Hope Felder]], a Professor of [[New Testament]] Language and Literature at [[Howard University]] and supporter of Afrocentric ideas, has warned Afrocentrists to avoid certain pitfalls,&lt;ref name="cain"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hope Felder | first1 = Cain | year = 1994 | title = Afrocentrism, the Bible, and the Politics of Difference | url = http://www.nathanielturner.com/twoscholarsdiscussafrocentrism.htm | journal = The Princeton Seminary Bulletin | volume = XV | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including:
* Demonizing categorically all white people, without careful differentiation between persons of goodwill and those who consciously perpetuate racism.
* Adopting [[multiculturalism]] as a curricular alternative that eliminates, marginalizes, or vilifies European heritage to the point that Europe epitomizes all the evil in the world.
* Gross over-generalizations and using factually or incorrect material is bad history and bad scholarship.&lt;ref name="cain"/&gt;

[[Nathan Glazer]] writes that although Afrocentricity can mean many things, the popular press has generally given most attention to its most outlandish theories.&lt;ref name="Glazer1997"&gt;Nathan Glazer, ''We Are All Multiculturalists Now'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1997 {{ISBN|0-674-94836-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Glazer agrees with many of the findings and conclusions presented in Lefkowitz's book ''Not Out of Africa''. Yet he also argues that Afrocentrism often presents legitimate and relevant scholarship.&lt;ref name="Glazer1997"/&gt; The late [[Manning Marable]] was also a critic of Afrocentrism. He wrote:&lt;ref name="autogenerated192"/&gt;
{{Quote|Populist Afrocentrism was the perfect social theory for the upwardly mobile black petty bourgeoisie. It gave them a sense of ethnic superiority and cultural originality, without requiring the hard, critical study of historical realities. It provided a philosophical blueprint to avoid concrete struggle within the real world.... It was, in short, only the latest theoretical construct of a politics of racial identity, a world-view designed to discuss the world but never really to change it.|Manning Marable| Beyond Black and White: Transforming African American Politics}}

Some Afrocentrists{{Who|date=October 2015}} agree in rejecting those works which critics have characterized as examples of bad scholarship. Adisa A. Alkebulan notes that the work of Afrocentric scholars is not fully appreciated because critics use the claims of "a few non-Afrocentrists" as "an indictment against Afrocentricity."&lt;ref name="DefendingtheParadigm"&gt;Adisa A. Alkebulan, "Defending the Paradigm", ''Journal of Black Studies'', Vol. 37, No. 3, pp. 410–427 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the historian [[August Meier]] critically reviewed the new work of Mary Lefkowitz on Afrocentrism as "Eurocentric". He criticized her book ''Not out of Africa: How Afrocentrism became an Excuse to Teach Myth as History'' for what he saw as her neglect of the African-American historic literature of the 19th and 20th centuries. Meier believes she fails to take the African-American experiences into account, to the extent that she "fails to answer the question raised in this book's subtitle".&lt;ref&gt;Meier, August, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2945660 "Review: Mary Lefkowitz, ''Not out of Africa: How Afrocentrism became an Excuse to Teach Myth as History''"], ''Journal of American History'', December 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maghan Keita]] describes the controversy over Afrocentrism as a [[cultural war]]. He believes certain "epistemologies" are warring with each other: the "epistemology of blackness" argues for the "responsibilities and potential of black peoples to function in and contribute to the progress of civilization."&lt;ref&gt;Maghan Keita, ''Race and the Writing of History: Riddling the Sphinx'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Warsaw Uprising}}
The failure of the '''[[Warsaw Uprising]]''' and subsequent [[The capitulation of Warsaw after the Warsaw Uprising|Capitulation]] agreement left [[Warsaw]] almost uninhabited. The city was almost totally destroyed with no major monuments left standing. This, however, was not the end. The [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] was in disarray and unprepared to deal with the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[NKVD]] which subsequently took control of [[Poland]] and sent many of the former resistance fighters to their deaths in [[Siberia]]n [[gulags]].

The political effect is a matter of controversy. Some{{who?|date=February 2016}} claim that without the uprising, Poland would have become a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republic]], whilst others claim that the uprising itself was the mistake which enabled [[Joseph Stalin]] to arrange for his enemies to destroy his inconvenient allies and left Poland fatally weakened.

==Destruction of the city==
{{main|Planned destruction of Warsaw}}

==People hiding in the remnants==
Some people were hiding in the remnants of the city, e.g. [[Władysław Szpilman]], who later wrote his memoir [[The Pianist (memoir)|''The Pianist'']], filmed by [[Roman Polanski]] (''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'', 2002). They became known as the [[Robinson Crusoes of Warsaw]].

==The legacy==
Due to lack of cooperation and often the active aggressive moves on the part of the Soviets and several other factors, Warsaw Uprising and Operation Tempest failed in their primary goal—to free part of Polish territories, so that a government loyal to Polish government in exile could be established there instead of a Soviet [[puppet state]]. There is no consensus among historians if that was ever possible, and if those operations had other lasting effect. Some{{who|date=November 2013}} argue that without Operation Tempest and Warsaw Uprising, Poland would end as a Soviet republic, a fate definitely worse than that of ''independent'' puppet state, and thus the Operation succeeded at least partially in being a political demonstration to Soviets and Western Allies.

[[Image:Uprising bulletholes.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Shrapnel holes are still visible on the walls of many buildings in Warsaw]]

==Armia Krajowa soldiers who remained in Poland==
Most soldiers of the Home Army (including those who took part in the Warsaw Uprising) were persecuted after the war; captured by the [[NKVD]] or [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa|SB]], interrogated and imprisoned, awaiting trials on various charges. Many of them were sent to [[Gulag]]s or executed.

==Armia Krajowa soldiers who were liberated by the Western Allies==
[[Image:Powazki powstanie 1.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Graves of Polish soldiers in [[Powazki Cemetery|Powązki Cemetery]]]]
Most of those sent to POW camps in Germany were later liberated by British, American and Polish forces and stayed in the West, including uprising leaders [[Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski]] and [[Antoni Chrusciel|Antoni Chruściel]], who stayed in [[London]] and the United States, respectively. Some chose to return to Poland in the hope of rejoining their families. In many cases, those who returned shared the fate of their comrades who had spent their entire time in Poland.

==Long-term effect on Communist Poland==
The courage of the Warsaw Uprising, kept anti-Soviet sentiment high in Poland throughout the [[Cold War]]. The post-war Communist regime attempted to counter this sentiment with extensive [[propaganda]] that downplayed and even outright denied Soviet culpability. Nevertheless, memories of the uprising helped to inspire the Polish labour movement [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], which led a peaceful movement against the Communist government during the 1980s, leading to the downfall of that government in 1989 and the emergence of democracy.

'''Anders Anton von Stiernman''' (September 27, 1695&amp;nbsp;– March 2, 1765), was a Swedish historian and manuscript collector.

==Biography==
He was born on September 27, 1695 in [[Stockholm]]. He adopted the name Stiernman after his stepfather. In 1715 he became a student in Uppsala, he hesitated in choosing between the ministry and the military, but finally came to devote himself to historical studies, which he had interest in the course of his employment as a tutor of [[Gustaf Rålamb]], whose libraries and collections at his disposal. In 1718 he was a clerk of Antiquities Archives, but was later transferred to the [[Swedish National Archives]].

He made research trips in 1722 to Copenhagen and in 1724 the Baltic provinces. In 1732 he was promoted to actuary and 1740 to secretary to the director. In 1743 he was ennobled as "von Stiernman". In 1745 he was made a member of the [[Swedish Academy of Sciences]] and in 1747 became the Secretary.

&lt;!--In 1750 he was inserted in the "abbreviation Commission, which was assigned to investigate, how unnecessary extensively in writing within the administration could be avoided. After his ennobling, he withal frequently in parliamentary work as a member of chivalry and nobility, and was elected several times in different riksdagsdeputationer. He soon became widely known in the scholarly world, both within and outside the country as a writer and editor of many scholarly works.

Early on, he had behaved like vitterhetsidkare, including one Fröjdetal in Latin verse in Frederick I's coronation. The manuscript left Stiernman, except unprinted parts of the aforementioned works, including major collections relating to the nobility under the title Suecia Illustris (genealogical tables, biographical information, etc., 27 bands in folio). --&gt;
He died on March 2, 1765.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author= |coauthors= |editor= |encyclopedia=[[Nordisk familjebok]] |title=Anders Anton von Stiernman |url=http://runeberg.org/nfcf/0719.html |isbn= |pages= |quote= | accessdate=2011-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bruce Alexander Grenfell Murray''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|QSO}} (born 18 September 1940) is a former [[Test cricket]]er for [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] who played 13 Tests as a right-handed opening batsman between 1968 and 1971. He was a school principal in the [[Wellington]] area from 1981 to 2002, and the author of several geography textbooks. Since his retirement from teaching he has been a cricket administrator in Wellington and a historian.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Bruce Murray cricketer 1960.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Murray in 1960]]
Born in [[Johnsonville, New Zealand|Johnsonville]], a northern suburb of [[Wellington]], Bruce Murray attended [[Hutt Valley High School]], then went to [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University]] studying Geography. He completed an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in Geography at [[Canterbury University]].&lt;ref name="TL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tawalink.com/bruce_murray.html| title=2 Minutes with Bruce Murray| publisher=TawaLink|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic career==
Murray played his first [[first-class cricket|first-class]] match at the age of 18 for [[Wellington cricket team|Wellington]] against [[Central Districts cricket team|Central Districts]] at Wellington in 1958-59, scoring 49 in the first innings. After several seasons in the [[Plunket Shield]], he was selected for New Zealand's non-Test [[New Zealand cricket team in Australia in 1967–68|tour of Australia in 1967-68]], where he scored 351 runs at an average of 43.87. 

His highest first-class innings came in 1968-69 when he scored 213 out of a total of 392 for 5 declared for Wellington against [[Otago cricket team|Otago]] in Dunedin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/29/29863.html| title = Otago v Wellington 1968-69| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate = 23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the leading scorer in the Plunket Shield in 1969-70, and had the highest average: in four matches he made 430 runs at an average of 61.42, with five fifties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/3/Plunket_Shield_1969-70/Batting_by_Average.html| title = Batting in Plunket Shield 1969-70| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate = 25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
He made his Test debut in early 1968 against India in Dunedin, scoring 17 and 54.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' 1969, p. 854.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first innings of the Second Test in Christchurch he scored 74, putting on 126 for the first wicket with [[Graham Dowling]] to set New Zealand on the path to its first Test victory over India; he also took four catches in the match.&lt;ref&gt;''Wisden'' 1969, pp. 855-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

He toured England in 1969 and India and Pakistan in 1969-70. His highest Test score, 90, and another four catches, helped New Zealand to its first Test victory over Pakistan in a low-scoring match in Lahore in 1969-70; the day after the Test he scored 157 in three and a half hours for the New Zealanders against the BCCP President's XI in Rawalpindi.&lt;ref&gt;''Wisden'' 1971, pp. 862-863.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Against the [[Australian cricket team in New Zealand in 1969–70|Australians in 1969-70]], on a difficult pitch in the second unofficial Test at [[Lancaster Park]], he scored a century, taking only 37 minutes over his second fifty.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Smith, ''Kiwis Declare: Players Tell the Story of New Zealand Cricket'', Random House, Auckland, 1994, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; He so dominated the batting that, when he was dismissed for 110, New Zealand's score was only 144 for four.&lt;ref&gt;[[Don Neely]] &amp; Richard Payne, ''Men in White: The History of New Zealand International Cricket, 1894–1985'', Moa, Auckland, 1986, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is one of just three players to have taken a Test wicket without conceding a run, giving him a career bowling average of 0.00. In the Third Test in Wellington in 1968 he bowled 6 balls and dismissed the Indian opener [[Syed Abid Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/29/29295.html | title=New Zealand v India in 1967/68 | publisher=CricketArchive | accessdate=2007-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
Along with his contemporaries in the New Zealand team [[Bryan Yuile]] and [[Vic Pollard]] he would not play cricket on Sundays for religious reasons. The later careers of the three were therefore curtailed by the widespread introduction of Sunday play in the early 1970s. In 1967 he wrote a pamphlet, ''The Christian and Sport''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://tepuna.on.worldcat.org/search?queryString=no%3A155869290#/oclc/155869290| title=The Christian and sport|publisher = Te Puna| accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the tour of England, India and Pakistan, which took five months from June to November 1969, Murray was glad to get back to his teaching job. He later reflected:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I saw what professional cricket could do to you as a person. You became much more self-centred, much more inward-looking, much too concerned about the wrong parts of the game, watching the averages. Not so team-oriented. I found the notion of professional sport to be a contradiction in terms. It isn't sport. It hardens people, makes them selfish and narrows their view of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Smith, ''Kiwis Declare'', p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==After cricket==
After his retirement from cricket, Murray continued his teaching career, teaching at [[Tawa College]] near Wellington, then at [[Naenae College]] in Lower Hutt, where he became principal in 1981, before becoming principal at Tawa College from 1989 to 2002.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; In June 2002 he was awarded the [[Queen's Service Order]] for public service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Queen honours artists, mathematicians, sports people and literary lights|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=2044545|website=NZ Herald|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also a writer. In the 1970s and 1980s he wrote or co-wrote a number of geography textbooks. Since his retirement he has written several books about the [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa]] district. 

He has lived in Tawa since 1964. He and his wife Shona have three daughters and a son.&lt;ref name="TL"/&gt; His granddaughter [[Amelia Kerr]] has played international cricket for New Zealand, and appeared at the [[2017 Women's Cricket World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/422278 |title=Women’s World Cup – Eight youngsters to watch |accessdate=22 June 2017 |work=International Cricket Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as President of Cricket Wellington from 2004 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Annual Report 2012-13 |url=http://www.cricketwellington.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Report-TXT-2013-11-28-21.pdf |website=Cricket Wellington |accessdate=7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the 2008-09 season, the Bruce Murray Medal has been awarded annually for sportsmanship in Wellington club cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unlikely finalists in spotlight|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/749658/Unlikely-finalists-in-spotlight|website=Stuff.co.nz|accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act had two parts: first, it reformed the calendar of [[Kingdom of England|England]]{{efn|Scotland had changed to a 1 January start in 1600.}} and the [[British Empire|British Dominions]] so that the new legal year began on 1 January rather than 25 March ([[Lady Day]]); and, second, Great Britain and its Dominions adopted (in effect){{efn|The Act makes no reference to Gregory, since to do so might imply recognition of Papal primacy. It acknowledges the inconvenience of having a differing system from neighbouring countries and recognises the error in the Julian calendar. It defined a calendar identical to the Gregorian system, from first principles.}} the [[Gregorian calendar]], as already used in most of western [[Europe]].

Chesterfield introduced the Bill into Parliament on 25 February 1751 (1750 Old Style). It was passed by the Commons on 13 May and received [[royal assent]] on 27 May 1751.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=H.|last=Dagnall|title=Give us back our eleven days|location=Edgware|publisher=author|year=1991|isbn=0-9515497-2-3|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Reasons for change==
The Parliament held that the [[Julian calendar]] then in use, and the start of the year on 25 March, were 
{{quote|attended with divers inconveniences, not only as it differs from the usage of neighbouring nations, but also from the legal method of computation in Scotland, and from the common usage throughout the whole kingdom, and thereby frequent mistakes are occasioned in the dates of deeds and other writings, and disputes arise therefrom.&lt;ref name=Act/&gt;}}

==Great Britain and the British Colonies==
In England and Wales, the legal year 1751 was a short year of 282 days, running from 25 March to 31 December. 1752 began on 1 January. To align the calendar in use in England to that on the continent, the Gregorian calendar was adopted, and the calendar was advanced by 11 days: Wednesday 2 September 1752 was followed by Thursday 14 September 1752.{{efn|"An unusual calendar is printed for September 1752. That is the month 11 days were skipped to make up for lack of leap year adjustments" ([[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] manual and [[Cal (Unix)#Features]]).}} The year 1752 was thus a short year (355 days) as well.

As well as adopting the Gregorian rule for leap years, Pope Gregory's rules for the date of Easter were also adopted. However, with religious strife still on their minds, the British could not bring themselves to adopt the Catholic system explicitly: the Annexe to the Act established a [[computus|computation for the date of Easter]] that achieved the same result as Gregory's rules, without actually referring to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apgb/Geo2/24/23/section/3 24 Geo. II Ch. 23, § 3]. &lt;/ref&gt; The [[algorithm]], set out in the [[Book of Common Prayer]] as required by the Act, includes calculation of the [[golden numbers|Golden Number]] and the [[Dominical Letter|Sunday Letter]], which (in the Easter section of the Book) were presumed to be already known. The Annexe to the Act includes the definition: "''Easter-day'' (on which the rest depend) is always the first ''Sunday'' after the ''Full Moon'', which happens upon, or next after the Twenty-first Day of ''March''. And if the ''Full Moon'' happens upon a ''Sunday'', ''Easter-day'' is the ''Sunday'' after." The Annexe subsequently uses the terms "Paschal Full Moon" and "Ecclesiastical Full Moon", making it clear that they only approximate to the real Full Moon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apgb/Geo2/24/23/section/6 24 Geo. II Ch. 23, Annexe].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scotland===
Scotland had already partly made the change: its calendar year had begun on 1 January since 1600.{{sfn|Bond|1875|loc=See footnote on pages xvii–xviii: original text of the Scottish decree}} The remainder of the act applied equally to Scotland, a part of  the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] since the [[Acts of Union 1707]].

===Ireland===
At the time Ireland was an Independent kingdom in a [[personal union]] with [[the Crown]] of Great Britain. So that the calendar in Ireland would remain harmonised with that of Great Britain, the [[Parliament of Ireland]] passed similarly worded legislation as the "Calendar (New Style) Act, 1750".{{sfn|Parliament of Ireland|1750}}

==Reaction and effect==
[[Image:William Hogarth 028.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Humours of an Election|An Election Entertainment]]'' (c. 1755), a painting by [[William Hogarth]], which is the main source for "Give us our Eleven Days".]]
Some history books say that some people rioted after the calendar change, asking that their "eleven days" be returned. However this is very likely a myth, based on only two primary sources: The ''World'', a satirical journal of [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]]; and a painting by [[William Hogarth]].&lt;ref name=Poole&gt;{{harvnb|Poole|1995}}; {{harvnb|Steel|2000|p=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chesterfield was behind the Act. He wrote to his son, "Every numerous assembly is a mob, let the individuals who compose it be what they will. Mere sense is never to be talked to a mob; their passions, their sentiments, their senses and their seeming interests alone are to be applied to.  Understanding have they collectively none." Here, he was boasting of his skill in having the Bill passed through the Lords; the 'mob' in question was his fellow peers.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}}

When the son of the [[George Parker, 2nd Earl of Macclesfield|Earl of Macclesfield]] (who had been influential in passing the Act) stood for [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] in Oxfordshire as a [[British Whig Party|Whig]] in 1754, dissatisfaction with the calendar reform was one of a number of issues raised by his [[Tory Party|Tory]] opponents. In 1755, William Hogarth produced a painting (and an engraved print from the painting) loosely based on these elections, entitled ''[[Humours of an Election|An Election Entertainment]]'', which shows a placard carrying the slogan "Give us our Eleven Days" (on floor at lower right). An example of the resulting incorrect history is by [[Ronald Paulson]], author of ''Hogarth, His Life, Art and Times'', who wrote that "the Oxfordshire people ... are specifically rioting, as historically the London crowd did, to preserve the 'Eleven Days' the government stole from them in September 1752 by changing the calendar".&lt;ref name=Poole/&gt;

Thus the "calendar riot" fiction was born. The [[British general election, 1754|election campaign depicted]] concluded in 1754, after a very lengthy contest between Court Whigs and Jacobite Tories. Every issue between the two factions was brought up, including the question of calendar reform. The Tories attacked the Whigs for every deviation, including their alleged favouritism towards foreign Jews and the [[Gregorian calendar|"Popish" calendar]]. Hogarth's placard, part of a satire on the character of the debate, was not an observation of actual crowd behaviour.&lt;ref name=Poole/&gt;

There were, however, legitimate concerns about tax and other payments under the new calendar. Provision 6 (''Times of Payment of Rents, Annuities'') of the Act stipulated that monthly or yearly payments would not become due until the dates that they originally would have in the Julian calendar, or in the words of the Act "[Times of Payment of Rents, Annuities] at and upon the same respective natural days and times as the same should and ought to have been payable or made or would have happened in case this Act had not been made".&lt;ref name=Act&gt;{{UK-LEG|title=Calendar (New Style) Act 1750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several theories have been proposed for the odd beginning of the British tax year on 6 April.{{sfn|HMRC|2008}} One is that from 1753 until 1799, the tax year began on 5 April, which corresponded to 25 March Old Style. After the twelfth skipped Julian leap day in 1800, it was changed to 6 April, which still corresponded to 25 March Old Style. However it was not changed when a thirteenth Julian leap day was skipped in 1900, so the tax year in the [[United Kingdom]] still begins on 6 April.{{sfn|Philip|1921|p=24}}{{sfn|''Legislation.gov.uk''|2017}} However Poole thought that [[quarter day]]s, such as Lady Day on 25 March, marked the ''end'' of the quarters of the financial year.{{sfn|Poole|1995|loc=note 77}} Thus, although 25 March Old Style marked the beginning of the civil year, the next day, 26 March Old Style was until 1752 the ''beginning'' of the tax year. After removing eleven days in 1752, this corresponded to 6 April New Style, where it remains today. Although Poole's theory is supported by one dictionary,{{sfn|Webster's Dictionary|1913}} the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] as well as other sources state that quarter days mark the ''beginning'' of their respective quarters.{{efn|"Each of the four days fixed by custom as marking off the quarters of the year, ... the payment of rent and other quarterly charges fall due, ... In England ... the quarter days are traditionally Lady Day (March 25),&amp;nbsp;..." [[Oxford English Dictionary]] ''quarter day'', n.}}{{sfn|Frecknall-Hughes|2016}}

In [[Appalachia]], some Scots-Irish settlers resisted the changeover mandated by the Calendar Act by continuing to celebrate [[Christmas]] on January 6 (N.S.), referring to the day as ''Old Christmas''.{{sfn|Blair|2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14593">The '''Cambodian humanitarian crisis''' from 1969 to 1993 consisted of a series of related events which resulted in the death, displacement, or resettlement abroad of millions of Cambodians.

The crisis had several phases.  First was the [[Cambodian Civil War]] between the [[Lon Nol]] government and the [[communist]] [[Khmer Rouge]] from 1970 to 1975.  This phase was also marked by intensive [[United States]] bombing from 1969 to 1973 of the [[Khmer Rouge]] and sanctuaries and bases inside [[Cambodia]] of the [[North Vietnamese Army]] as part of its strategy to win the [[Vietnam War]].  The second phase was the rule of the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979.  The Khmer Rouge murdered or starved about one-fourth of the 8 million Cambodian people.

In 1979, Vietnam invaded Cambodia and overthrew the Khmer Rouge.  Vietnam and the Cambodian government it created ruled the country for the next 12 years. The Khmer Rouge and other groups fought a guerrilla war against the Vietnamese occupiers and the Cambodian government.  In 1979 and 1980, the chaos caused hundreds of thousands of Cambodians to rush to the border with Thailand to escape the violence and to avoid the famine which threatened Cambodia.  Humanitarian organizations coped with the crisis with the "land bridge", one of the largest humanitarian aid efforts ever undertaken.

From 1981 to 1991, the guerrilla war against the Vietnamese and Cambodian government continued and hundreds of thousands of Cambodians continued to reside in refugee camps in Thailand or on the border with Thailand.  About 260,000 of the refugees were resettled abroad, more than one-half of them in the United States.  The final phase of the Cambodian humanitarian crisis was its resolution in 1991-1993.  Vietnam withdrew from the country and the [[United Nations]] led Cambodia toward an elected government and [[repatriation|repatriated]] 360,000 Cambodians, emptying and closing the refugee camps.

==The civil war and U.S. bombing==
{{Details|Cambodian Civil War}}
In 1969, the United States began extensive bombing of North Vietnamese sanctuaries and bases, mostly in eastern Cambodia. The bombing later expanded to target the Khmer Rouge. During the same time period, the Khmer Rouge began its rise as an indigenous guerrilla force to challenge the government.  The impact and interrelationship of the bombing and the growth of the Khmer Rouge is disputed by historians. On March 18, 1970, Lon Nol overthrew the government of Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]].  Lon Nol initiated an unsuccessful campaign to oust the soldiers and cut the supply lines of the North Vietnamese in Cambodia. In response, the NVA poured out of the sanctuaries and captured additional Cambodian territory. This territory was handed over the Khmer Rouge. Around the same time, US and South Vietnamese troops initiated the [[Cambodian Campaign]] to oust North Vietnamese troops from the sanctuaries.

The humanitarian consequences of U.S. bombing were high. The U.S. may have dropped a tonnage of bombs on Cambodia nearly equal to all the bombs dropped by the U.S. in [[World War II]].  Estimates of Cambodian military and civilian deaths resulting from the 1969-1973 bombing range from 40,000 to more than 150,000.&lt;ref&gt;Marek Sliwinski, Le Génocide Khmer Rouge: Une Analyse Démographique (L'Harmattan, 1995), pp41-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Kiernan |first1= Ben  |author1-link= Ben Kiernan |last2= Owen |first2= Taylor |title= Bombs over Cambodia |url= http://www.yale.edu/cgp/Walrus_CambodiaBombing_OCT06.pdf |journal= [[The Walrus]] |issue= October 2006 |pages= 62–69 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Heuveline, Patrick (2001).

Quinn was later U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia&lt;/ref&gt; The civil war forced many Cambodians in the countryside to flee to the cities for safety.  The population of [[Phnom Penh]] increased from 600,000 to more than 2 million.  Resupply of the city by land and sea was cut off by the Khmer Rouge and, by the time the government surrendered on April 17, 1975, many of the inhabitants were starving.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Larry Clinton ''Refugee Workers in the Indochina Exodus, 1975-1982'' Jefferson, NC: MacFarland Publishing Company, 2010, pp. 34-38&lt;/ref&gt; During the civil war, 200,000 to 300,000 Cambodians died from all causes.&lt;ref&gt;Heuveline, Patrick (2001).

==Khmer Rouge rule==

The first action of the Khmer Rouge on taking power in Phnom Penh was to order the populace to abandon the cities of Cambodia.  "One third to one half of the population of the country was forced by the communists at gunpoint to walk into the countryside in tropical temperatures and monsoon rains without provision for food, water, shelter, physical security, or medical care."&lt;ref&gt;"Cambodia's Crime" ''The New York Times'' July 9, 1975, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;  The urban dwellers who survived were forced to create new settlements in the jungle.  Former civil servants and soldiers of the Lon Nol government were executed.&lt;ref&gt;United States, Congress, House. ''Human Rights in Cambodia'' 95th Congress,lst Session, Washington, DC: GPO, 1973, pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The death toll from execution, starvation, and disease during the almost four years of Khmer Rouge rule is usually estimated at between one and three million persons.&lt;ref&gt;Heuveline, Patrick "The Demographic Analysis of Mortality Crises: The Case of Cambodia, 1970-1979" in ''Forced Migration and Mortality'' Washington, DC: National Academies Press, 2001, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vietnamese invasion and famine==

On December 25, 1978, Vietnam invaded Cambodia and soon took over most of the country, establishing a pro-Vietnamese government to rule Cambodia, which they called the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]]. Tens of thousands of Cambodians were killed in the invasion or executed by the new government.&lt;ref&gt;Etcheson, Craig, ''After the Killing Fields'' New York: Praeger, 2005, pp 24-27&lt;/ref&gt; The remnants of the Khmer Rouge retreated to the [[Cardamon Mountains]] near the border with Thailand and other resistance movements sprang up in western Cambodia.

During the rule of the Khmer Rouge only a few thousand Cambodians had been able to escape Cambodia and take refuge in Thailand. With the Vietnamese invasion, the floodgates opened and Cambodians attempted to cross into Thailand in large numbers.  In June 1979, the Thai government forced more than 40,000 Cambodian refugees back into Cambodia at [[Prasat Preah Vihear|Preah Vihear]] temple.  3,000 or more Cambodians were killed attempting to cross a minefield. The Preah Vihear incident stimulated the international humanitarian community into action to help Cambodians who often arrived at the Thai border in the last extremity of starvation.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 177-178&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1979, Vietnamese offensives against the Khmer Rouge and other opposition groups plus a threatened famine in Cambodia had forced 750,000 people, many of them combatants against the Vietnamese, to the Thai border.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;   Most were prevented from entering Thailand, but resided in makeshift camps along the border, although more than 100,000 were inside Thailand at [[Khao-I-Dang]] Holding Center.  Many of the new arrivals were malnourished or starving.&lt;ref&gt;UNHCR, ''State of the World's Refugees, 2000'' p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

==The land bridge==

Fighting between the Vietnamese and anti-Vietnamese forces disrupted Cambodian rice production in 1979.  A country-wide famine was anticipated in 1980.  Aid agencies estimated that up to 2.5 million Cambodians were at risk of starvation.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, W. Courtland, ''Terms of Refuge'' London: Zed Books Ltd., 1998, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  The pro-Vietnamese government in Phnom Penh demanded that all humanitarian aid be channeled through it, and some UN and aid organizations attempted to work with the government. However, there were reports of "delivery and distribution problems".&lt;ref name = "migration"/&gt;

The [[Nong Chan Refugee Camp#Robert Ashe.27s .22Land Bridge.22|"land bridge"]], conceived by aid worker Robert Patrick Ashe, was a relief measure that bypassed the Phnom Penh government.&lt;ref name="Shawcross"&gt;Shawcross, William. ''The Quality of Mercy: Cambodia, Holocaust, and Modern Conscience.'' New York: Simon and Schuster, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Humanitarian organizations and international aid agencies brought rice and other rice seed to [[Nong Chan Refugee Camp]] on the Cambodian border in Thailand and distributed the rice to Cambodians who came to the border.  "Vast numbers of Cambodians with oxcarts and bicycles...came to the border every day" and were given sacks of rice to take home with them.&lt;ref name = "migration"&gt;[http://forcedmigration.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/book/export/html/306 "The Land Bridge" ''Forced Migration''], accessed 21 Jan 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The land bridge was a "huge and successful operation," distributing together with other aid operations, including rice distribution to occupants of urban Phnom Penh, about 150,000 metric tons of rice, other food, and rice seed to Cambodians from December 1979 to September 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, pp. 215-216&lt;/ref&gt;

While the land bridge was successful in helping to avert what appeared to be an impending famine in Cambodia, it was controversial among aid agencies.  Some aid agencies favored cooperation with the government in Phnom Penh and accused the land bridge of encouraging a black market in food and assisting anti-government forces, including the Khmer Rouge. The impact of the land bridge can not be fully measured as there was no means of monitoring the end use of the food it distributed.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resettlement and refugee camps==

The border camps fluctuated in size during the 1980s depending upon the intensity of fighting inside Cambodia.  Combatants took shelter in the border camps and both Vietnamese and Cambodian government forces [[Vietnamese border raids in Thailand|frequently shelled the camps]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/3ebf9bad0.html UNHCR ''State of the World's Refugees, 2000''], p. 95, accessed 20 Jan 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, at Khao-I-Dang and other refugee camps a few miles inside Thailand, Cambodians, mostly urban middle-class survivors of the Khmer Rouge, hoped for resettlement abroad. Khao-I-Dang reached a peak population of 160,000 in March 1980, but with resettlement, repatriation (sometimes involuntary), and transfer to other camps the population declined to 40,000 by December 1982 and the camp took on a status described as "the most elaborately serviced refugee camp in the world." [[Site Two Refugee Camp]] grew to a population of 160,000 in 1987.  Both refugee and border camps were characterized by fighting among political factions, violence, rape, depression, and inactivity. The refugee camps were declared closed to new arrivals by the government of Thailand, but Cambodians gained access through bribery or being smuggled into the camps.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, p. 89-98; Mason, L. and R. Brown, ''Rice, Rivalry, and Politics: Managing Cambodian Relief''. 1983, Notre Dame [Ind.]: University of Notre Dame Press, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the Cambodians in the refugee and border camps remained there for years, fearful of returning to their country and desiring resettlement abroad. A total of 260,000 Cambodians would be resettled between 1975 and 1997, mostly in the United States (153,000) and France (53,000).&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Appendix 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repatriation==

In October 1991, a comprehensive peace agreement was reached between the contending parties in Cambodia which called for the withdrawal of Vietnamese military forces and the creation of the [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia]] (UNTAC) with the responsibility of enforcing a ceasefire, organizing elections for a new Cambodian government, and repatriating Cambodians still in refugee camps in Thailand or in border camps.&lt;ref name = "UNTAC"&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/untacbackgr1.html "United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC)], accessed 20 Jan 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNHCR]] supervised the repatriation effort which resulted in 360,000 Cambodians returning to the country from refugee and border camps in Thailand.&lt;ref name = "UNTAC"/&gt; Khao-I-Dang and other refugee camps were closed.  Their remaining population was transferred to Site Two which was closed in mid-1993 after its population was repatriated to Cambodia&lt;ref&gt;Grant M, Grant T, Fortune G, Horgan B. ''Bamboo &amp; Barbed Wire: Eight Years as a Volunteer in a Refugee Camp.'' Mandurah, W.A.: DB Pub., 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elections in May 1993 established an independent Cambodian government and UNTAC was dismantled.  A sizable number of UN and humanitarian aid workers remained in the country to promote human rights and democracy and support reconstruction and economic development.&lt;ref name = "UNTAC"/&gt;

In many universities across the United States, Chicano Studies is linked with interdisciplinary ethnic studies and other [[Ethnic Studies]] fields such as [[Black Studies]], [[Asian American Studies]], and [[Native American Studies]]. Many students who have studied anthropology have also been involved in varying degrees in Chicano studies.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED438967|title = Chicano Drivers of Ideas in Anthropology across Space and Place: Pre-Postmodern Debts to Chicano Studies and Others|last = Velez-Ibanez|first = Carlos G.|date = 1998|journal = JSRI Occasional Paper No. 53 Latino Studies Series|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today most major universities in areas of high Chicano concentration have a formal Chicano studies department or interdisciplinary program.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Providing classes in the ethnic studies area, like Chicano studies has been shown to help the "learning environment for students of color through limiting feelings of prejudice and experiences of discrimination in college."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/cgi-bin/login.cgi|title = Counterspaces and Connections in College Transitions: First-Generation Latino Students' Perspectives on Chicano Studies|last = Nuñez|first = Anne-Marie|date = 2011|journal = Journal of College Student Development|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 May 2015|volume = 52|subscription = yes|issue = 6|pages = 639–655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Many Chicano scholars agree that Chicano studies came about as a result of the Chicano student movements, whether they were in the form of protests, activism or just taking part in ''[[Chicano Movement|el movimiento]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chicano Studies: The Genesis of a Discipline|last = Soldatenko|first = Michael|publisher = University of Arizona Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780816599530|location = Tucson, Arizona|pages = 12–37|chapter = The Genesis of Academic Chicano Studies, 1967-1970|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780816599530/9780816599530-6.pdf|access-date = 12 May 2015|format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicano studies was seen as a way to advance Mexican American perspectives on culture, history and literature.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The major push for universities and colleges to include Chicano studies came within the context of the African-American civil rights struggle.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED273429|title = The Current Status and Future of Chicano Studies Programs: Are They Academically Sound?|date = April 1986|accessdate = 12 May 2015|website = ERIC|publisher = U.S. Department of Education|last = Rochin|first = Refugio I.|last2 = de la Torre|first2 = Adela}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED114133|title = Administrative Reorganizational Needs in Chicano Studies at Cerritos College|date = 25 April 1975|accessdate = 12 May 2015|website = ERIC|publisher = U.S. Department of Education|last = Hinrichsen|first = Keith A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Mexican American educators demanded that colleges and universities address the pedagogical needs of Mexican American students.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This was especially important because Mexican American student populations grew significantly in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, many young people and students were becoming very politically active and began to organize for political causes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A very prominent student organization that grew out of the civil rights movements of the '60s was the [[Mexican American Youth Organization]] (MAYO), which began to work towards educational reform.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Making of Chicano Studies: In the Trenches of Academe|last = Acuna|first = Rodolfo|publisher = Rutgers University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 9780813550701|location = New Brunswick|pages = 36–58|chapter = From Student Power to Chicano Studies|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780813550701/9780813550701-10.pdf|access-date = 13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAYO was very active in promoting student walkouts in [[Texas]] and [[California]] to highlight problems that Mexican American students faced.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As students became more organized, they began to develop "experimental colleges" where informal classes on topics important to the Chicano movement were taught.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Manuel H. Guerra, professor at the University of Southern California and chair of the [[Mexican American Political Association|Mexican American Political Association's]] (MAPA) Education Committee, reported in 1963 on "serious discriminatory policies and practices" at his university in relation to hiring Mexican Americans, especially considering that there had been an increase in the number of Mexican American students.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Making of Chicano Studies: In the Trenches of Academe|last = Acuna|first = Rodolfo|publisher = Rutgers University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 9780813550015|location = New Brunswick|pages = 14–35|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780813550701/9780813550701-9.pdf|chapter = The Sixties and the Bean Count}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serving Mexican American students without providing Mexican American faculty was considered a sort of colonialism and cultural assimilation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In addition, many Mexican American students were put at a disadvantage because speaking [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (even outside of class) was considered "degrading" or "un-American."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Opportunities such as the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) helped increase the number of minorities entering colleges and universities.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Educators and students alike began to visualize "an academic program that could serve and transform the Mexican American community," a program that would become Chicano studies and which was built by and for Chicanos.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chicano Studies: The Genesis of a Discipline|last = Soldatenko|first = Michael|publisher = University of Arizona Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780816599530|location = Tucson, Arizona|pages = 38–66|chapter = Empirics and Chicano Studies: The Formation of Empirical Chicano Studies, 1970-1975|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780816599530/9780816599530-7.pdf|access-date = 14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, anthropologist Octavio Romano along with graduate students at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] began to publish a Chicano studies journal called ''El Grito: A Journal of Contemporary Mexican-American Thought''.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=76504493&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Chicano Studies Examined|last = Gonzalez|first = Phillip B.|date = 2012|journal = Journal of American Ethnic History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 May 2015|subscription = yes|volume = 31|issue = 4|pages = 69–74|issn = 0278-5927}}&lt;/ref&gt; His co-founder was Nick. C. Vaca.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Many of the ideas surrounding the formation of later Chicano studies programs stemmed from this publication.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; One major idea that was put forth in ''El Grito'' by its editors was that Mexican Americans, in contrast to other ethnic groups, "have retained their distinct identity and refused to disappear into The Great American Melting Pot."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The consequence of this, said the editors, was that Mexican Americans were kept in an economically and politically impoverished state.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Also in 1967, Ralph Guzmán, a political scientist was hired by [[CSULA|Los Angeles State College]] to conduct a study which would lay the foundation for the creation of a national center for Mexican American studies at [[CSULA|California State College, Los Angeles (CSCLA)]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Both Mexican American and Black Student Unions pressed CSCLA to have ethnic studies classes at this time.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The [[Plan de Santa Barbara]] is generally considered to be the manifesto of Chicano studies.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Drafted in 1969 at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], the plan emphasizes the need for education, and especially higher education to enact Chicano community empowerment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Plan helped to "establish Chicano studies as an entity incorporated into the structures of academia."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, while the Plan articulated a need for education, it did not specify how to create a program of study.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The Plan did, however, lead to the creation of the Chicano Studies Institute in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://oru.research.ucsb.edu/csi/?page_id=6|title = About the Institute|date = |accessdate = 14 May 2015|website = Chicano Studies Institute|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important document in Chicano studies was also produced in 1969. In March of that year, the Chicano Youth Conference held in [[Denver]] produced a plan written by Chicano poet, [[Alurista]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It was called ''[[Plan Espiritual de Aztlán|El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán]]'' (The Spiritual Plan of Aztlán) and it contains a concept of "ethnic nationalism and self-determination."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The idea of the mythic homeland of the Aztec people, [[Aztlán]], is one that unifies the United States and Mexico and correspondingly, united Mexican Americans with a sense of nationalism.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/arizona_quarterly_a_journal_of_american_literature_culture_and_theory/v058/58.1.aranda.pdf|title = Making the Case for New Chicano/a Studies: Recovering Our Alienated Selves|last = Aranda Jr.|first = Jose F.|date = 2002|journal = Arizona Quarterly|doi = 10.1353/arq.2002.0011|pmid = |access-date = 14 May 2015|pages = 127–158|subscription = yes|volume = 58|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, a major Chicano journal began to be published at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_quarterly/v054/54.4pulido.html|title = In the Spirit of Ernesto Galarza: Recent Publications in Chicano Studies|last = Pulido|first = Alberto Lopez|date = 2002|journal = American Quarterly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 14 May 2015|subscription = yes|volume = 54|issue = 4|pages = 719–729}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal was called ''Aztlán: A Journal of Chicano Studies'' and it was created at first by the students.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The journal, ''Aztlán'', had a big influence on the discourse surrounding Chicano studies and helped "establish and legitimize" the subject in colleges and universities.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The name of the journal came directly from ''El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán'' and under the direction of the historian Juan Gomez-Quiñones, the journal supported and sustained a culture of activism.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Chicano scholars in 1970 also wrote papers for the Chicano Studies Institute which were later published in the journal, ''Epoca''.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; These papers addressed topics such as Chicano curriculum, goals of the educational program and how to achieve academic recognition.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

As Chicano studies programs began to be implemented at universities, it was necessary to provide infrastructure and support. In 1973, the [[University of California, Berkeley]] recognized the need to provide quality library materials to support the Chicano studies programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED164147|title = Providing Library Services for the Chicano Studies Program at the University of California, Berkeley|date = 1973|accessdate = 12 May 2015|website = ERIC|publisher = U.S. Department of Education|last = Padilla|first = Raymond V.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicano scholars also recognized the need to have a "Chicano-controlled academic" space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chicano Studies: The Genesis of a Discipline|last = Soldatenko|first = Michael|publisher = University of Arizona Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780816599530|location = Tucson, Arizona|pages = 94–129|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780816599530/9780816599530-9.pdf|chapter = Chicano Studies as an Academic Discipline, 1975-1982|access-date = 14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers began to study the impact that these new programs had on students, finding that Mexican-American students responded positively to Chicano studies and also to bilingual classes.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED118160|title = Chicano Studies and Self-Concept: Implications for the Community Colleges|date = 1975|accessdate = 12 May 2015|website = ERIC|publisher = U.S. Department of Education|last = Gonzalez|first = Jess}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many scholars felt that the philosophy of education in the United States at the time was "inconsistent with the values of the Chicano movement" and that Chicano studies needed to create tools for students to use in the real world and also a new type of research to solve problems.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; It was also important to find ways to recruit Chicano teachers and administration within the schools to support students and research.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Further support for Chicano studies came in the form of the [[National Association of Chicana and Chicano Studies|National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies]] (NACCS) which was created in 1972 in [[San Antonio|San Antonio, Texas]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.naccs.org/naccs/History.asp|title = History of NACCS|date = |accessdate = 14 May 2015|website = National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NACCS allows scholars in Chicano studies to exchange ideas, share research, communicate and it also has an annual conference.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The conferences were important to help bring together scholars and legitimize Chicano studies, since other disciplines have similar annual conferences.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

By 1975, many Chicano studies programs were in place at major universities.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The ten years between 1977 and 1987 saw "tremendous changes in the foundations of Chicano/a studies."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; During this period, Chicano studies began to include more diverse voices that better represented women, homosexuality and other under-represented groups under the umbrella of "Chicano" while also acknowledging the many differences within the group.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  In 1981, the Mexican American Studies and Research Center (MASRC) at the University of Arizona was established. MASRC focused on contemporary applied public policy research on Mexican Americans.  MASRC became a department in 2009. As the [https://web.archive.org/web/20160402085833/http://mas.arizona.edu/ Mexican American Studies Department], it continued public policy research and teaching to addressing issues of concern to Mexican American communities. It currently offers bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and in 2011, began offering a Ph.D. degree in Mexican American Studies. The idea of the "borderland" or [[nepantla]] grew stronger than the idea of Aztlán by the 1980s and Chicanaos celebrated the many different (often conflicting) aspects of themselves.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; ''[[Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza]]'' (1987) by [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa|Gloria Anzaldúa]] both grew out of and signifies this change.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Chicano studies became less about nationalism, and more about belonging to a group and contributing to "something greater."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This shift helped reshape the mission of Chicano studies and gave it "new life" and "new authority."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The 1980s saw more Chicano Studies programs integrated into institutions of higher learning while it also created a "canonical approach" to its studies and "gatekeeping procedures" to evaluate promotions and [[tenure]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, Chicano studies programs helped universities and colleges fulfill [[Affirmative action in the United States|Affirmative Action]] requirements.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; During the mid 1990s, however, a study found that most Chicano studies programs were still very non-uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED380034|title = Current Mexican-American and Chicano Studies Undergraduate College Programs in the United States|date = 1995|accessdate = 12 May 2015|website = ERIC|publisher = U.S. Department of Education|last = Jaramillo|first = James A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the reason that many Chicano studies programs were not consistent in what was studied is that a core curriculum had not yet been formally published.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The first primer of Chicano studies was published in 1980 by Diego Vigil, called ''From Indians to Chicanos: A Sociocultural History''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In addition, there was a lack of Chicano faculty with only 1.2% of faculty at U.S. colleges and universities having any "Hispanic" ethnicity at all in 1985.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Many of the faculty teaching Chicano studies didn't feel that their own programs were "qualitatively sound."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Schools of thought ==
Chicano studies has two major threads, one is considered pragmatic and the other transformational.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_literary_history/v025/25.3.perez-torres.html|title = Chicano Studies's Two Paths|last = Pérez-Torres|first = Rafael|date = 2013|journal = American Literary History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 12 May 2015|volume = 25|issue = 3|subscription = yes|pages = 683–692}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pragmatic method involves a more activist and "politicized" approach while the transformational method is more in line with working within the traditions of academia, rather than against it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Current Events==
[[File:Arizona Ethnic Studies.jpg|alt=Protesters against HB 2281|thumb|350x350px|Protesters are seen in June 2011 in support of the [[Tucson Unified School District]]'s Mexican-American studies program. A new state law effectively ended the program saying it was divisive.]]
On May 11, 2010, the Governor of [[Arizona]], [[Jan Brewer]], signed House Bill 2281 (also known as HB 2281) which prohibits a school district or charter school from including in its curriculum courses that
#Promote the overthrow of the United States Government
#Promote resentment toward any race or class
#Advocate ethnic solidarity instead of being individuals
#Are designed for a certain ethnicity
while still allowing:
#Native American classes to comply with federal law
#Grouping of classes based on academic performance
#Classes about the history of an ethnic group open to all students
#Classes discussing controversial history
Another provision of the law stated that any school district or charter school breaching its stated provisions would be liable to lose state funding as a public institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/hb2281s.pdf |title=Arizona House Bill 2281 (2010) |format=PDF |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the [[Mexican American Studies Department Programs, Tucson Unified School District|Mexican-American studies program]] as taught by Tucson Unified School District (TUSD) came under scrutiny and was found to be in violation of the law by [[Tom Horne]]. However, an independent audit (paid for by the state of Arizona) was conducted, and found the program was not in breach of HB 2281.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Racial Lens Used to Cull Curriculum in Arizona|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/19/education/racial-lens-used-to-cull-curriculum-in-arizona.html?_r=2|work=nytimes.com|format=article|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
With pressure from former Arizona Superintendent [[Tom Horne]], who felt the courses were breaching HB 2281, and after TUSD issued an appeal stating otherwise, Superintendent [[John Huppenthal]] deemed that the course must be disbanded or TUSD would lose funding.&lt;ref name="mex-amer"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mexican-american.org/history/2010/arizona/education/chicano-studies-ban.html | title=Arizona Bans Chicano Studies in Public Schools | first=Tito | last=Rodriguez | publisher=Mexican-American.org | date=May 13, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427090236/http://www.mexican-american.org/history/2010/arizona/education/chicano-studies-ban.html | archivedate=April 27, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in January 2012, the TUSD school board came to a 4-1 decision that the program was to be disbanded in lieu of the district losing state funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-tucson-school-board-daily-show-20120404,0,5593283.story | title= Mexican American studies: 'Daily Show' Segment Strikes a Nerve | author=Castellanos, Dalina | date=April 4, 2012 | publisher= Los Angeles Times | accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further consequence of HB 2281 was opening the door to challenges and limiting classes teaching Chicano studies not just in Arizona, but across the United States.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Colin Henry Wilson''' (26 June 1931&amp;nbsp;– 5 December 2013) was an English writer, philosopher and novelist. He also wrote widely on [[true crime]], [[mysticism]] and the [[paranormal]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-25367040 "Colin Wilson, author of The Outsider, dies aged 82"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104181122/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-25367040 |date=4 January 2016 }}

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Wilson was born on 26 June 1931 in [[Leicester]],&lt;ref name="IndepObit" /&gt; the first child of Arthur and Annetta Wilson. His father worked in a shoe factory.&lt;ref name="somepurpose"&gt;Colin Wilson, ''Dreaming to Some Purpose'' (Arrow, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of eleven he attended Gateway Secondary Technical School, where his interest in science began to blossom. By the age of 14 he had compiled a multi-volume work of essays covering many aspects of science entitled ''A Manual of General Science''. But by the time he left school at sixteen, his interests were already switching to literature. His discovery of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s work, particularly ''[[Man and Superman]]'', was a landmark. He started to write stories, plays, and essays in earnest – a long "sequel" to ''Man and Superman'' made him consider himself to be 'Shaw's natural successor.' After two unfulfilling jobs – one as a laboratory assistant at his old school – he drifted into the Civil Service, but found little to occupy his time. In the autumn of 1949, he was drafted into the Royal Air Force but soon found himself clashing with authority, eventually feigning homosexuality in order to be dismissed. Upon leaving he took up a succession of menial jobs, spent some time wandering around Europe, and finally returned to Leicester in 1951. There he married his first wife, (Dorothy) Betty Troop, and moved to London, where a son was born. But the marriage rapidly disintegrated as he drifted in and out of several jobs. During this traumatic period, Wilson was continually working and reworking the novel that was eventually published as ''Ritual in the Dark'' (1960).&lt;ref&gt;Colin Wilson's 'Ritual in the Dark' {{cite web|url=http://www.londonfictions.com/colin-wilson-ritual-in-the-dark.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304184711/http://www.londonfictions.com/colin-wilson-ritual-in-the-dark.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also met three young writers who became close friends – [[Bill Hopkins (novelist)|Bill Hopkins]], [[Stuart Holroyd]] and [[Laura Del Rivo]].&lt;ref&gt;Laura Del Rivo 'The Furnished Room' {{cite web |url=http://www.londonfictions.com/laura-del-rivo-the-furnished-room.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329151312/http://www.londonfictions.com/laura-del-rivo-the-furnished-room.html |archivedate=29 March 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another trip to Europe followed, and he spent some time in Paris attempting to sell magazine subscriptions. Returning to Leicester again, he met Joy Stewart – later to become his second wife and mother of their three children – who accompanied him to London. There he continued to work on ''Ritual in the Dark'', receiving some advice from [[Angus Wilson]] (no relation) – then deputy superintendent of the [[British Museum Reading Room|British Museum's Reading Room]] – and slept rough (in a sleeping bag) on [[Hampstead Heath]] to save money.&lt;ref&gt;Desert Island Discs Archive: 1976–1980&lt;/ref&gt;

On Christmas Day, 1954, alone in his room, he sat down on his bed and began to write in his journal. He described his feelings as follows:

{{bquote|It struck me that I was in the position of so many of my favourite characters in fiction: [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky|Dostoyevsky's]] Raskolnikov, [[Rainer Maria Rilke|Rilke's]] Malte Laurids Brigge, the young writer in [[Knut Hamsun|Hamsun's]] ''Hunger'': alone in my room, feeling totally cut off from the rest of society. It was not a position I relished . . . Yet an inner compulsion had forced me into this position of isolation. I began writing about it in my journal, trying to pin it down. And then, quite suddenly, I saw that I had the makings of a book. I turned to the back of my journal and wrote at the head of the page: 'Notes for a book The Outsider in Literature'}}

== ''The Outsider'' ==
{{main|The Outsider (Colin Wilson)}}

[[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]] published the 24-year-old Wilson's ''[[The Outsider (Colin Wilson)|The Outsider]]'' in 1956. The work examines the role of the social "outsider" in seminal works by various key literary and cultural figures{{spaced ndash}}such as [[Albert Camus]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[William James]], [[T. E. Lawrence]], [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]]{{spaced ndash}}and discusses Wilson's perception of [[social alienation]] in their work. The book became a best-seller and helped popularise existentialism in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;
[[Kenneth Allsop]], ''The Angry Decade; A Survey of the Cultural Revolt of the Nineteen Fifties''. London: Peter Owen Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; It has never been out of print and has been translated into more than thirty languages.

The back cover of the 2001 paperback edition reads:
{{bquote|[In ''The Outsider''] Wilson rationalized the psychological dislocation so characteristic of Western creative thinking into a coherent theory of alienation, and defined those affected by it as a type: the Outsider. Through the works of various artists... Wilson explored the psyche of the Outsider, his effect on society and society's on him. Nothing has happened in the past four decades that has made ''The Outsider'' any less relevant...}}

== Career ==

=== Non-fiction writing ===
Wilson became associated with the "[[angry young men]]" of British literature. He contributed to ''[[Declaration (anthology)|Declaration]]'', an anthology of manifestos by writers associated with the movement, and was also anthologised in a popular paperback sampler, ''Protest: The [[Beat Generation]] and the Angry Young Men''.&lt;ref name="Maschler"&gt;{{cite book|title=''Declaration''|author=Maschler, Tom (editor)|year=1957|location=London|publisher=MacGibbon and Kee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feldman and Gartenberg"&gt;{{cite book|title=''Protest: The Beat Generation and the Angry Young Men''|author=Feldman, Gene and Gartneberg, Max (editors)|year=1958|location=New York|publisher=Citadel Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some viewed Wilson and his friends [[Bill Hopkins (novelist)|Bill Hopkins]] and [[Stuart Holroyd]] as a sub-group of the "Angries", more concerned with "religious values" than with liberal or socialist politics.&lt;ref name="Allsop"&gt;{{cite book|title=''The Angry Decade; A Survey of the Cultural Revolt of the Nineteen Fifties''|author=Allsop, Kenneth|year=1958|location=London|publisher=Peter Owen Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics on the left swiftly labelled them as fascist; commentator [[Kenneth Allsop]] called them "the law givers".&lt;ref name="Allsop"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holroyd"&gt;
{{cite book|title=''Contraries: A Personal Progression''|author=Holroyd, Stuart|year=1975|location=London|publisher=The Bodley Head Ltd}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ''The Outsider'' notwithstanding, Wilson's second book, ''Religion and the Rebel'' (1957), was universally panned by critics although Wilson himself acknowledged it to be a more comprehensive book than the first one. While "The Outsider" was focused on documenting the subject of mental strain and near-insanity, ''Religion and the Rebel'' was focused on how to expand our consciousness and transform us into visionaries. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine published a review, headlined "Scrambled Egghead", that pilloried the book.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Wilson, ''The Angry Years'' Robson Books, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Undaunted, Wilson continued to expound his positive "new" existentialism in the six philosophical books known as "The Outsider Cycle", all written within the first ten years of his literary career. These books were summarised by ''Introduction to the New Existentialism'' (1966). When the book was re-printed in 1980 as ''The New Existentialism'', Wilson wrote: "If I have contributed anything to [[existentialism]] – or, for that matter, to twentieth century thought in general, here it is. I am willing to stand or fall by it."

In ''The Age of Defeat'' (1959) – book 3 of "The Outsider Cycle" – he bemoaned the loss of the hero in twentieth century life and literature; convinced that we were becoming embroiled in what he termed "the fallacy of insignificance". It was this theory that encouraged celebrated American psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]] to contact him in 1963. The two corresponded regularly and met on several occasions before Maslow's death in 1970. Wilson wrote a biography and assessment of Maslow's work, ''New Pathways in Psychology: Maslow and the Post-Freudian Revolution'', based on audiotapes that Maslow had provided, which was published in 1972. Maslow's observation of "peak experiences" in his students – those sudden moments of overwhelming happiness that we all experience from time to time – provided Wilson with an important clue in his search for the mechanism that might control the Outsider's "moments of vision". Maslow, however, was convinced that peak experiences could not be induced; Colin Wilson thought otherwise and, indeed, in later books like ''Access to Inner Worlds'' (1983) and ''Super Consciousness'' (2009), suggested how they could be induced at will.

Wilson was also known for what he termed "Existential Criticism", which suggested that a work of art should not just be judged by the principles of literary criticism or theory alone but also by what it has to say, in particular about the meaning and purpose of existence. In his pioneering essay for ''[[Chicago Review]]'' (Volume 13, no. 2, 1959, pp.&amp;nbsp;152–181) he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No art can be judged by purely aesthetic standards, although a painting or a piece of music may appear to give a purely aesthetic pleasure. Aesthetic enjoyment is an intensification of the vital response, and this response forms the basis of all value judgements. The existentialist contends that all values are connected with the problems of human existence, the stature of man, the purpose of life. These values are inherent in all works of art, in addition to their aesthetic values, and are closely connected with them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He went on to write several more essays and books on the subject. Among the latter were ''The Strength to Dream'' (1962), ''Eagle and Earwig'' (1965), ''Poetry and Mysticism'' (1970) ''The Craft of the Novel'' (1975), ''The Bicameral Critic'' (1985) and ''The Books In My Life'' (1998). He also applied existential criticism to many of the hundreds of book reviews he wrote for journals including  ''Books &amp; Bookmen'', ''[[The Literary Review]]'', ''[[The London Magazine]]'', ''John O'London's'', ''[[The Spectator]]'' and ''The Aylesford Review'' throughout his career. Some of these were gathered together in a book entitled ''Existential Criticism: selected book reviews'', published in 2009.

By the late 1960s Wilson had become increasingly interested in [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] and [[occult]] themes. In 1971, he published ''[[The Occult: A History]]'', featuring [[exegesis|interpretations]] on [[Aleister Crowley]], [[George Gurdjieff]], [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Kabbalah]], primitive [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], [[Franz Mesmer]], [[Grigori Rasputin]], [[Daniel Dunglas Home]] and [[Paracelsus]], among others. He also wrote a markedly unsympathetic biography of Crowley, ''Aleister Crowley: The Nature of the Beast'', and has written biographies on other spiritual and psychological [[visionary|visionaries]], including Gurdjieff, [[Carl Jung]], [[Wilhelm Reich]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], and [[P. D. Ouspensky]].

Originally, Wilson focused on the cultivation of what he called "Faculty X", which he saw as leading to an increased sense of [[Meaning (existential)|meaning]], and on abilities such as [[telepathy]] and the awareness of other [[Energy (psychological)|energies]]. In his later work he suggests the possibility of [[Afterlife|life after death]] and the existence of [[spirit]]s, which he personally analyses as an active member of [[the Ghost Club]].

He also wrote non-fiction books on crime, ranging from encyclopedias to studies of [[serial killing]]. He had an ongoing interest in the life and times of [[Jack the Ripper]] and in [[sex crime]] in general.

=== Fiction ===
Wilson explored his ideas on [[Aptitude|human potential]] and consciousness in fiction, mostly [[detective fiction]] or science fiction, including several [[Cthulhu Mythos]] pieces; often writing a non-fiction work and a novel concurrently – as a way of putting his ideas into action. He wrote:

{{bquote|For me [fiction] is a manner of philosophizing....Philosophy may be only a shadow of the reality it tries to grasp, but the novel is altogether more satisfactory. I am almost tempted to say that no philosopher is qualified to do his job unless he is also a novelist....I would certainly exchange any of the works of Whitehead or [[Wittgenstein]] for the novels they ought to have written"&lt;ref&gt;''Voyage to a Beginning'' (Cecil Woolf, 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;160-1)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Like some of his non-fiction work, many of Wilson's novels from ''Ritual in the Dark'' (1960) onwards have been concerned with the psychology of murder—especially that of serial killing. However, he has also written science fiction of a philosophical bent, including ''[[The Mind Parasites]]'' (1967), ''[[The Philosopher's Stone (novel)|The Philosopher's Stone]]'' (1969), ''[[The Space Vampires]]'' (1976) and the four-volume ''Spider-World'' series: ''Spider World: The Tower'' (1987), ''Spider World: the Delta'' (1987), ''Spider World: The Magician'' (1992) and ''Spider World: Shadowland'' (2003); novels described by one critic as "an artistic achievement of the highest order... destined to be regarded to be one of the central products of the twentieth century imagination."&lt;ref&gt;Howard F Dossor: ''Colin Wilson: the man and his mind'', Element, 1990, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Strength to Dream'' (1961) Wilson attacked [[H. P. Lovecraft]] as "sick" and as "a bad writer" who had "rejected reality"—but he grudgingly praised Lovecraft's story "[[The Shadow Out of Time]]" as capable science fiction. [[August Derleth]], incensed by Wilson's treatment of Lovecraft in ''The Strength to Dream'', then dared Wilson to write what became ''[[The Mind Parasites]]''—to expound his philosophical ideas in the guise of fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Wilson| first = Colin |title = The Mind Parasites (original preface)| publisher = Monkfish| year = 2005| page = xvii| url = https://www.amazon.com/The-Mind-Parasites-Colin-Wilson/dp/0974935999/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface to ''The Mind Parasites'', Wilson concedes that Lovecraft, "far more than Hemingway or [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]], or even [[Kafka]], is a symbol of the outsider-artist in the 20th century" and asks: "what would have happened if Lovecraft had possessed a private income—enough, say, to allow him to spend his winters in Italy and his summers in Greece or Switzerland?" answering that in his [Wilson's] opinion "[h]e would undoubtedly have produced less, but what he did produce would have been highly polished, without the pulp magazine cliches that disfigure so much of his work. And he would have given free rein to his love of curious and remote erudition, so that his work would have been, in some respect, closer to that of [[Anatole France]] or the contemporary Argentinian writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]]".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book| last = Wilson| first = Colin |title = The Mind Parasites| publisher = Oneiric Press| year = 1975| page = 112| url = https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Parasites-Colin-Wilson/dp/B000WU0PP8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Wilson also discusses Lovecraft in ''Order of Assassins'' (1972) and in the prefatory note to ''The Philosopher's Stone'' (1969). His short novel ''The Return of the Lloigor'' (1969/1974) also has roots in the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] – its central character works on the real book the [[Voynich manuscript]], but discovers it to be a mediaeval Arabic version of the ''[[Necronomicon]]'' – as does his 2002 novel ''The Tomb of the Old Ones''.

== Adaptations ==
[[Tobe Hooper]] directed the film ''[[Lifeforce (film)|Lifeforce]]'', based on Wilson's novel ''[[The Space Vampires]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Charles P. |title=A guide to apocalyptic cinema |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2001 |page=112 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bmmrKvOwa_IC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=%22space+vampires%22+lifeforce}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its release, Colin Wilson recalled that author [[John Fowles]] regarded the [[The Magus (film)|film adaptation]] of Fowles' own novel ''[[The Magus (novel)|The Magus]]'' as the worst film adaptation of a novel ever. Wilson told Fowles there was now a worse one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Wilson| first = Colin |title = Dreaming to Some Purpose | publisher = Monkfish| year = 2005| page = chapter 20| url = https://www.amazon.com/Dreaming-Some-Purpose-Colin-Wilson/dp/0099471477}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A film of his 1961 novel ''Adrift in Soho'' by director Pablo Behrens is due to be released by Burning Films in 2018.

== Reception ==
Howard F. Dossor wrote: "Wilson constitutes one of the most significant challenges to twentieth-century critics. It seems most likely that critics analysing his work in the middle of the twenty-first century, will be puzzled that his contemporaries paid such inadequate attention to him. But it is not merely for their sake that he should be examined. Critics who turn to him will find themselves involved in the central questions of our age and will be in touch with a mind that has disclosed an extraordinary resilience in addressing them."&lt;ref&gt;Howard F. Dossor ''Colin Wilson: the Man and His Mind'' (1990) Element Books, pp 318–319. {{ISBN|1-85230-176-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic Nicolas Tredell writes: "The twenty-first century may look back on Colin Wilson as one of the novelists who foresaw the future of fiction, and something, perhaps, of the future of man."&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Tredell ''Novels to Some Purpose: the fiction  of Colin Wilson'' (2015) Paupers' Press, . {{ISBN|9780956866363}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Science writer [[Martin Gardner]] saw Wilson as an intelligent writer but duped by [[paranormal]] claims. He once commented that "Colin bought it all. With unparalleled egotism and scientific ignorance he believed almost everything he read about the paranormal, no matter how outrageous." Gardner described Wilson's book ''The Geller Phenomenon'' as "the most gullible book ever written about the Israeli charlatan". Gardner concluded that Wilson had decayed into an "occult eccentric" writing books for the "lunatic fringe".&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, Martin]] (1984). ''Order and Surprise''. Oxford University Press. pp. 361–364. {{ISBN|0-19-286051-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist [[Dorothy Rowe]] gave Wilson's book ''Men of Mystery'' a negative review and wrote that it "does nothing to advance research into the paranormal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Rowe, Dorothy |authorlink= Dorothy Rowe |title=Men of mystery |work=New Scientist |date=26 January 1981 |pages=231–232 |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benjamin Radford]] has written that Wilson had a "bias toward mystery-mongering" and that he ignored scientific and skeptical arguments on some of the topics he wrote about. Radford described Wilson's book ''The Mammoth Encyclopedia of the Unsolved'' as "riddled with errors and obfuscating omissions, betraying a bizarre disregard for accuracy".&lt;ref&gt;
[[Benjamin Radford|Radford, Benjamin]] (2013).

Center for Inquiry. Retrieved 2014-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the first full-length biography of Wilson, reviewing his entire life's work, ''Beyond the Robot: The Life and Work of Colin Wilson'', by [[Gary Lachman]], appeared. It received a positive endorsement from [[Philip Pullman]], who wrote that "Wilson was always far better and more interesting than fashionable opinion claimed, and in Lachman he has found a biographer who can respond to the whole range of his work with sympathy and understanding, in a style which, like Wilson's own, is always immensely readable." [[Michael Dirda]] in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called Wilson a "controversial writer who explored the nature of human consciousness in dozens of books" and said that Lachman, a "leading student of the [[western esoteric tradition]], writes with "exceptional grace, forcefulness, and clarity."&lt;ref&gt;"Ufos, alien abductions, the occult: to one man, the building blocks of scholarship" Michael Dirda ''The Washington Post'' 31 August 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Brett Taylor "enjoyed" the biography, but said that "a more critical author might have written a book that argued for the subject's worth in a broader and more convincing context. Lachman displays credulity on occult matters and an admiration for Wilson's sometimes dodgy philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Brett |title=Colin Wilson's Idiosyncratic Literary Legacy |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 July 2016 the 'First International Colin Wilson Conference' was held at the University of Nottingham. The 'Second International Colin Wilson Conference' will take place at the same venue on July 6, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://pauperspress.co.uk/conference.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand French|topic=geo|date=December 2009|Crémieu}}

'''Crémieu''' is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the [[Isère]] [[Departments of France|department]] in southeastern [[France]]. This small medieval village of 3,500 inhabitants hosts a celebration called "Les Médiévales" every year in September, which reconstitutes the lifestyle of the Middle Ages. 
The seal of the région includes a dolphin. The inhabitants of this village are also called "les dauphinois" from the noun "dauphin" in French. The local dish is "le gratin dauphinois" which is a rich potato gratin.

It is located near [[Bourgoin-Jallieu]], about 25 miles east of [[Lyon]].

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
Crémieu is located north-west of the county, 15 km north of Bourgoin, 12 km east of [[Lyon-Saint-Exupéry Airport]] and about 25 miles (40 km) east of Lyon.

The surrounding communities are [[Leyrieu]] to the north, [[Annoisin-Chatelans]], [[Siccieu-Saint-Julien-et-Carisieu]], [[Dizimieu]], [[Villemoirieu]] and [[Saint-Romain-de-Jalionas]].

According to the classification established by [[INSEE]] in 1999 Crémieu is an urban town, the city center of an urban unit of two municipalities (the other being Villemoirieu), part of the Lyon urban area.
=== Physical geography ===
The city lies between a hilly area to the east and the flat land of the valley of the [[Rhône (river)|Rhone]] flowing 3 miles (5 km) north. 

==Early history==
Crémieu has a long and important medieval history. First historical references to Crémieu date back to the 12th century, when a [[Benedictine]] [[priory]] was built high on the cliffs of Saint-Hippolyte. The town itself, however, grew up during the 13th century, on the southern slopes of Saint-Laurent hill and overlooking the walls of the royal castle which the Dauphins of La Tour began to restore in 1282. In 1315, the town was granted important civic and trading rights which marked the beginning of two centuries of prosperity. Building of a new covered market started in 1434, as did the construction of a fortified wall, almost 2 kilometers long, with 9 gates and 14 towers. The wall encircled not only the royal castle, the old town and the cliff of Saint-Hippolyte, but also the site of a new town below, next to an Augustinian monastery. In 1357, a mint was set up at Crémieu, making it even more prosperous. In 2006 a ''petit blanc'' coin, struck in the Cremieu mint in 1446 (validated by Cremieu museum) was discovered in the keel of the Newport Medieval Ship. This allowed  the construction of the vessel to be dated to not earlier than 1446. It is assumed the ''petit blanc'' was placed in the Ship as a token of good luck. The minter of the coin was Jaques Vincent.
From the reign of Louis XII (1498–1515), Crémieu benefited from its strategic position on the route of French expeditionary forces bound for Italy. The town became a major trading centre in cereals for France, Savoy, Switzerland and Italy.
As early as the 15th century, it had an important [[Jewish]] community. Raoul de Gaucourt, governor of Dauphiné, renewed the privileges of the Jews in 1441 for seven years in consideration of the sum of 50 florins, which Moses Dandéli of Crémieu and Aguinet Solomon of Saint-Symphorien, Jewish residents, were to collect from their coreligionists. The Jews of Crémieu refused to pay the sum and emigrated in large numbers. The dauphin [[Louis XI of France]] recalled them in 1449, and promised them that if they would reopen their banking-houses, he would tax them only one ounce of fine silver in the future, instead of the half-mark that they had formerly been required to pay.
New gates were built in 1535 and the lower town, design along the lines of most medieval "new towns", was completed at the beginning of the 16th century. The 17th century brought monasteries and convents to Crémieu, where trade was by now beginning to flag. The Capuchins settled there in 1615, the white Penitents in 1619, the nuns of the order of Visitations in 1627, the Ursuline nuns in 1633, the Notre-Dame du Reclus hospital opened in 1675 and the church of Saint-John was completed by the end of the 17th century.
The town's economic decline, finalised by the suppression, in 1702, of the annual trade fairs dating back to the 14th century, led the townspeople to turn to the leather and textile industries during the 18th century. In 1710, a quarter of the population was working as tanners, cobblers, carders (of both hemp and wool) and spinners.
In the next century, the plateau of Isle-Cremieu and the sleepy town below the ruins of the castle and ramparts began to attract landscape artists, led by Corot, as well as travellers, tourists and lovers of all things beautiful.

==Population==
The residents of the city are known as ''Crémolan''.

'''Denis Williams''' (1 February 1923 – 28 June 1998)&lt;ref name=Persaud&gt;Petamber Persaud, [http://www.guyanatimesinternational.com/?p=21704 "The Life and Work of Denis Williams (1923–1998)| The Shaping of Guyanese Literature"], ''Guyana Times International'', 23 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Guyana|Guyanese]] painter, author and [[archaeologist]].

==Biography==
Denis Joseph Ivan Williams was born in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], Guyana,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peepaltreepress.com/author_display.asp?au_id=176 Author information] at [[Peepal Tree Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; where he received his early education; he was granted a Cambridge Junior School Certificate in 1940 and a Cambridge Senior School Certificate in 1941. His promise as a painter won him a two-year [[British Council]] Scholarship to the [[Camberwell School of Art]] in London in 1946. He lived in London for the next 10 years, during which he taught fine art and held several one-man shows of his work as well as producing the artwork for Bajan novelist [[George Lamming]]'s first book ''[[In the Castle of My Skin|In the Castle of my Skin]]''.

From 1957 to 1967 he taught art and art history at the School of Fine Art, [[Khartoum]], [[Sudan]]; the [[University of Ife]], [[Nigeria]]; [[Makerere University]], [[Uganda]]; and the [[University of Lagos]], Nigeria. He also published numerous articles on the history and iconography of West African classical art expressed especially in brass, bronze, and iron, and a book, ''Icon and Image: A Study of Sacred and Secular Forms of African Classical Art'' (1974, [[New York University Press]]).

Williams had been exposed to archaeology in Sudan and renewed his interest in 1968 when he finally returned to Guyana and established a homestead in the [[Cuyuni-Mazaruni|Mazaruni]] District. In his first letter to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1973, he said: "my interest in these antiquities is that they may explain something about the who and how, as well as the when of the arts of the Guyana Indians."&lt;ref&gt;Betty J. Meggers, [http://www.saa.org/Portals/0/SAA/publications/SAAbulletin/17-4/saa14.html "Denis J. I. Williams, 1923-1998"], ''Journal for the Society for American Archaeology'', 17.4 (September 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; His appointment in 1974 as director of the newly created [[Walter Roth Museum of Anthropology]] in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] provided the opportunity to pursue this quest. Initially, he concentrated his attention on [[petroglyphs]], not only recording the designs, but excavating to recover the tools used and observing the environmental contexts. His Master's thesis, ''The Aishalton Petroglyph Complex in the Prehistory of the Rupununi Savannas,'' submitted to the [[University of Guyana]] in 1979, presented ideas elaborated in a 1985 article published in the journal ''[[Advances in World Archaeology]]''.

In 1980 he began intensive archaeological and [[paleoclimatic]] investigations of the [[shell midden]]s on the northwest coast of Guyana. From the beginning of his studies, he was aware of potential disturbance of stratigraphy, errors in [[radiocarbon]] dates, and other pitfalls, and some of his efforts to detect them were detailed in ''Early Pottery on the Amazon: A Correction''.&lt;ref&gt;1997, ''American Antiquity'' 62: 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for a correlation between the declining productivity of [[mangrove]] resources and changes in artefacts and settlement behaviour was summarised in ''Some Subsistence Implications of Holocene Climatic Change in Northwestern Guyana''.&lt;ref&gt;1982, ''Archaeology and Anthropology''.&lt;/ref&gt; His observation that the methods employed by the [[Warao people|Warao]] for processing palm starch are preadapted for eliminating the poison from bitter [[manioc]] offers a reasonable explanation for the origin of this remarkable technology.&lt;ref&gt;1992, "El Arcaico en el Noroeste de Guyana y los Comienzos de la Horticultura". In B. J. Meggers (ed.), ''Prehistoria Sudamericana'', pp. 233–51.&lt;/ref&gt; A monograph detailing his evidence and interpretations of the interaction between environmental change and Guyana prehistory was in press at the time of his death.

He recognised the importance of publication and in 1978 founded ''Archaeology and Anthropology'', the journal of the [[Walter Roth Museum of Anthropology]] in Georgetown. Among other journals Williams edited were ''Odu'' (the University of Ife Journal of African studies) and ''Lagos Notes and Records'', and he contributed numerous essays on art to several books and journals. His skill as a writer is documented not only in his scientific papers, but in numerous works of fiction.

In 1986 Williams and his assistant, Jennifer Wishart, initiated a programme for junior archaeologists in Guyanese secondary schools.

==Awards==
His accomplishments were recognised in several national awards, including the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Guyana#The Golden Arrow of Achievement|Golden Arrow of Achievement]] Award from the government of Guyana in 1973, and the Cacique Crown of Honour in 1989, the same year that he received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of the West Indies]].&lt;ref name=Persaud /&gt;

'''Georgette Louise Meyer''' (March 14, 1919 &amp;ndash; November 4, 1965) known as '''Dickey Chapelle'''&lt;ref&gt;"Dickey Chapelle." ''Almanac of Famous People''. Gale, 2011. ''Biography In Context''. Web. 27 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[photojournalist]] known for her work as a [[war correspondent]] from [[World War II]] through the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/topics/chapelle&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Chapelle was born in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] and attended [[Shorewood High School (Wisconsin)|Shorewood High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shorewood School District to honor alumni, ex-teachers |publisher=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=2003-05-07 |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=138868 |accessdate=2007-09-17 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of sixteen, she was attending [[aeronautics|aeronautical design]] classes at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. She soon returned home, where she worked at a local airfield, hoping to learn to pilot airplanes instead of designing them. However, when her mother learned that she was also having an affair with one of the pilots, Chapelle was forced to live with her grandparents in Coral Gables, [[Florida]]. There, she wrote press releases for an air show, which led to an assignment in Havana, Cuba.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dickey Chapelle Under Fire: Photographs by the First American Female War Correspondent Killed in Action|last=Garofolo|first=John|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society Press|year=2015|isbn=9780870207181|location=Madison, Wisconsin|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A story on a Cuban air show disaster that Chapelle submitted to the ''New York Times'' got her noticed by an editor at Transcontinental and Western Air (TWA), which prompted her to move to [[New York City]]. Working at the TWA publicity bureau, she began to take weekly photography classes with Tony Chapelle, who became her husband in October 1940. She eventually quit her job at TWA to compile a portfolio, which she sold to ''Look'' magazine in 1941.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Later, after fifteen years of marriage, divorced Tony, and changed her first name to Dickey.

==Breakthrough==
Despite her mediocre photographic credentials, during [[World War II]] Chapelle managed to become a [[war correspondent]] photojournalist for [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]], and with one of her first assignments, was posted with the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] during the [[battle of Iwo Jima]]. She covered the [[battle of Okinawa]] as well.

After the war, she traveled all around the world, often going to extraordinary lengths to cover a story in any war zone. During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], Chapelle was captured and jailed for over seven weeks. She later learned to jump with [[paratrooper]]s, and usually travelled with troops. This led to frequent awards, and earned the respect of both the military and journalistic community.  Chapelle "was a tiny woman known for her refusal to kowtow to authority and her signature uniform: [[Battledress|fatigues]], an Australian [[Slouch hat|bush hat]], dramatic [[Harlequin]] glasses, and pearl earrings."&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fire in the Wind: The Biography of Dickey Chapelle|last=Ostroff|first=Roberta|date=February 11, 1992|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=|isbn=0-345-36274-8|location=|page=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Huet, Chapelle.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Henri Huet]]'s photograph of Chapelle receiving the [[last rites]] in Vietnam.]]

==Later life==
Despite early support for [[Fidel Castro]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chapelle | first = Dickey | title = What's A Woman Doing Here?: A Reporter's Report on Herself | pages =254–278 | publisher = William Morrow and Company | location = New York | year = 1962 | url = http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/cuban-rebels/chapelle.htm | accessdate =13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chapelle was an outspoken anti-[[Communist]], and loudly expressed these views at the beginning of the [[Vietnam War]]. Her stories in the early 1960s extolled the American [[military advisor]]s who were already fighting and dying in [[South Vietnam]], and the Sea Swallows, the anticommunist militia led by Father [[Nguyen Lac Hoa]]. Chapelle was killed in Vietnam on November 4, 1965 while on patrol with a Marine platoon during Operation Black Ferret, a search and destroy operation 16&amp;nbsp;km south of [[Chu Lai]], [[Quang Ngai Province]], [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Charles |title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam: The Landing and the Buildup, 1965 (Marine Corps Vietnam Operational Historical Series) |publisher=Marine Corps Association |year=1978 |isbn=978-0-89839-259-3 |pages=93–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lieutenant in front of her kicked a tripwire [[boobytrap]], consisting of a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] shell with a [[hand grenade]] attached to the top of it. Chapelle was hit in the neck by a piece of shrapnel which severed her carotid artery, and she died soon afterwards. Her last moments were captured in a photograph by [[Henri Huet]].&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt; Her body was repatriated with an [[honor guard]] consisting of six Marines, and she was given full Marine burial. 
She became the first female war correspondent to be killed in Vietnam, as well as the first American female reporter to be [[killed in action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mlQJrG0EASAC&amp;pg=PA67 |title= Brown Water, Black Berets: Coastal and Riverine Warfare in Vietnam |first= Thomas |last= Cutler |authorlink=Thomas J.

'''Diversification rates''' are the rates at which new species form (the [[Speciation]] rate, λ) and living species go extinct (the [[extinction]] rate, μ). Diversification rates can be estimated from [[fossils]], data on the species diversity of [[clades]] and their ages, or [[phylogenetic trees]]. Diversification rates are typically reported on a per-lineage basis (e.g. speciation rate per lineage per unit of time), and refer to the diversification dynamics expected under a [[birth-death process]].

A broad range of studies have demonstrated that diversification rates can vary tremendously both through time and across the tree of life. Current research efforts are focused on predicting diversification rates based on aspects of species or their environment. Diversification rates are also subject to various survivorship biases such as the [[Push of the past|"Push of the past"]]

== Methods for estimating diversification rates ==

=== Fossil time series ===

Diversification rates can be estimated time-series data on fossil occurrences. With perfect data, this would be an easy task; one could just count the number of speciation and extinction events in a given time interval, and then use these data to calculate per-lineage rates of speciation and extinction per unit time. However, the incomplete nature of the fossil record means that our calculations need to include the possibility that some fossil lineages were not sampled, and that we do not have precise estimates for the times of speciation and extinction of the taxa that are sampled. More sophisticated methods account for the probability of sampling any lineage, which might also depend on some properties of the lineage itself (e.g. whether it has any hard body parts that tend to fossilize) as well as the environment in which it lives.

Many estimates of diversification rates for fossil lineages are for higher-level taxonomic groups like genera or families. Such rates are informative about general patterns and trends of diversification through time and across clades but can be difficult to compare directly to rates of speciation and extinction of individual species.

=== Clade age and diversity ===

Diversification rates can be estimated from data on the ages and diversities of monophyletic clades in the tree of life. For example, if a clade is 100 million years old and includes 1000 species, we can estimate the net diversification rate of that clade by using a formula derived from a birth-death model of diversification:

Equations are also available for estimating speciation and extinction rates separately when one has ages and diversities for multiple clades.

=== Phylogenetic trees ===

Diversification rates can be estimated using the information available in phylogenetic trees. To calculate diversification rates, such phylogenetic trees have to include branch lengths. Various methods are available to estimate speciation and extinction rates from phylogenetic trees using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian statistical approaches. One can also use phylogenetic trees to test for changing rates of speciation and/or extinction, both through time and across clades, and to associate rates of evolution with potential explanatory factors.

{{distinguish|End of the world (disambiguation)}}
The '''end of history''' is a political and philosophical concept that supposes that a particular political, economic, or social system may develop that would constitute the end-point of humanity's sociocultural evolution and the final form of human government. A variety of authors have argued that a particular system is the "end of history" including [[Thomas More]] in ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=J. J.|title="The End of History": A Reappraisal of Marx's Views on Alienation and Human Emancipation|journal=Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue canadienne de science politique|date=1971|volume=4|issue=3|pages=367–380|jstor=3231359}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyov]], [[Alexandre Kojève]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/txt/kojeve-s.htm|title = History and Desire in Kojève|last = Boucher|first = Geoff|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Francis Fukuyama]] in the 1992 book, ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''.&lt;ref name="SpiegelFukuyamaInterview"&gt;Fukuyama himself began to revise his ideas and abandon some of the neoconservative components of his thesis since the [[Iraq War]]. [http://www.spiegel.de/international/interview-with-ex-neocon-francis-fukuyama-a-model-democracy-is-not-emerging-in-iraq-a-407315.html Interview with Ex-Neocon Francis Fukuyama: "A Model Democracy Is not Emerging in Iraq"] Spiegel Online, March 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of an end of history differs from ideas of an [[Eschatology|end of the world]] as expressed in various religions, which may forecast a complete destruction of the Earth or of life on Earth, and the end of the human race as we know it. The end of history instead proposes a state in which human life continues indefinitely into the future without any further major changes in society, system of governance, or economics.

==History==
The phrase, 'the end of history' was first used by French philosopher and mathematician [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] in 1861 "to refer to the end of the historical dynamic with the perfection of civil society".&lt;ref name="Featherstone"&gt;[[Mike Featherstone]], "Global and Local Cultures", in John Bird, Barry Curtis, Tim Putnam, ''Mapping the Futures: Local Cultures, Global Change'' (1993), p. 184, n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Arnold Gehlen]] adopted it in 1952 and it has been taken up more recently by [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Gianni Vattimo|Vattimo]]".&lt;ref name="Featherstone"/&gt;

The formal development of an idea of an "end of history" is most closely associated with Hegel, although Hegel discussed the idea in ambiguous terms, making it unclear whether he thought such a thing was a certainty or a mere possibility.&lt;ref&gt;William Desmond, "Hegel, Art, and History", in Robert L. Perkins, ed., ''History and System: Hegel's Philosophy of History'' (1984), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Postmodernism==
A postmodern understanding of the term differs in that "The idea of an 'end of history' does not imply that nothing more will ever happen. Rather, what the [[postmodern]] sense of an end of history tends to signify is, in the words of contemporary historian [[Keith Jenkins]], the idea that 'the peculiar ways in which the past was historicized (was conceptualized in modernist, linear and essentially metanarrative forms) has now come to an end of its productive life; the all-encompassing "experiment of modernity" ... is passing away into our postmodern condition'."&lt;ref&gt;Simon Malpas, ''The Postmodern'' (2004), p. 89, quoting Keith Jenkins (2001), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernest Hébrard''' (1875&amp;ndash;1933) was a [[France|French]] [[architect]], [[archaeologist]] and [[urban planner]] who completed major projects in Greece, Morocco, and French Indochina. He is renowned for his urban plan for the redevelopment of the center of [[Thessaloniki]] in [[Greece]] after a great fire in 1917.

==Work in Greece==
The majority of Thessaloniki was largely destroyed in the [[Great Thessaloniki Fire of 1917|Great Fire of 1917]]. The Greek Prime Minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] forbade the reconstruction of the city center until a modern city plan was approved. He commissioned Ernest Hébrard for the work, which the architect conceived and developed with the aid of the Greek architects Aristotelis Zachos and Konstantinos Kitsikis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=[[Benaki Museum]]| website=neohellenic architecture archives| title=Konstantinos Biris (1899-1980)| access-date=16 March 2015| url=http://www.benaki.gr/index.asp?id=1020403&amp;lang=en| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402142301/http://www.benaki.gr/index.asp?id=1020403&amp;lang=en| archivedate=2 April 2015| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan did away with the medieval and [[Orient]]al ([[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]) features of Thessaloniki, preserved its [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] heritage, and transformed it into a city with boulevards and contemporary roadways, squares and parks. Hébrard taught at the [[National Technical University of Athens]], and his work is well known in the architecture schools of Greece. 

==Work in Africa and Asia==
Hébrard  was also involved in  major projects in Africa and Asia, such as the upgrading of [[Casablanca]], the reconstruction of [[Diocletian]]'s palace at [[Split (city)|Split]], and later the planning for the main cities in [[French Indochina]]. He was appointed the head of the Indochina Architecture and Town Planning Service in 1923. He worked to incorporate into the French architecture being built there elements of vernacular design from the colonial territories of [[French Indochina]], now Việt Nam, Cambodia and Laos.&lt;ref name="Hahn2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rujivacharakul|first1=Vimalin|last2=Hahn|first2=H.

Hébrard oversaw the design of the French hill station of Dalat in Annam, Vietnam's middle province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Crossette|first= Barbara|date= 1998|title= The Great Hill Stations of Asia|url= |location= Boulder, CO|publisher= Westview Press|page= |isbn=9780813333267}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his work in Indochina he went again to Athens and worked for the Greek state.

In 1931 he returned to Paris, where he died at the age of 58 two years later.

'''Ezra Fleischer''' ({{lang-he|עזרא פליישר}}; 14 July 1928 – 25 July 2006) was a Romanian-Israeli Hebrew-language poet and [[Philology|philologist]].

== Biography ==
Fleischer was born in 1928 in [[Timişoara]], in the [[Banat]] region of western [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], and studied in the Jewish school that his father, [[Judah Loeb Fleischer]], had founded in 1918.

After [[World War II]], Fleischer was active in the [[Bnei Akiva]] movement in Romania and was imprisoned for his Zionist activities. While in prison, he wrote an epic Hebrew poem, “Massa Gog,” in which he predicted the downfall of [[Communism]]. The poem was smuggled out of Romania and was published in Israel, under a [[pen name]], where it caused somewhat of a “literary sensation”. Further books of poetry followed in Romania, all under a pen name.

In 1960, Fleischer emigrated to Israel, where he researched medieval Hebrew literature. He received a doctorate from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], where he also subsequently lectured until 1997.

He was also the director of the [[Cairo Geniza|Geniza]] Research Institute for Hebrew Poetry of the [[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]. His student [[Shulamit Elizur]] has succeeded him in this position.

His published work, most of it on poetry and prayer, covers a wide range of ancient and medieval Jewish life from Andalusia and Amsterdam to Syria and Cairo. He also wrote extensively about Judaism’s encounter with Islam and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ezra Fleischer, Expert on Hebrew Poetry, Is Dead at 78 |date=August 1, 2006 |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/01/arts/01fleischer.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of his career in 1966, Fleischer published a comprehensive and profound critique on Menahem Zulai’s book, ''The paytanic school of Rav Saadia Gaon'', wherein Zulai had brought together and summarized his research on  [[Saadia Gaon|Rabbi Saadia Gaon]]. According to Professor Yosef Tobi, Fleischer occasionally found that there exists a direct influence from [[Saadia Gaon|Saadia]] upon Spanish works, such as the integration of philosophical ideas in the liturgical poems composed by [[Joseph ibn Abitur]] and [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], the structure of the Spanish ''azharot'' and ''keter malkhut'' of Ibn Gabirol, the assignment of biblical verse as a linguistic model in poetry and alternate rhyming (''abab''). However, in all these assertive statements, there is still some ambivalence and uncertainty, seeing that Fleischer is careful to point out that “the secular Hebrew poetry of Spain is not a continuation of pre-Spanish secular poetry, but rather a new formation in terms of its virtues and character: a faithful reflection, in principle, of Arabic secular poetry.”&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Tobi, in article entitled, "The Liturgical Work of Rav Saadia Gaon
In the Research of Ezra Fleischer"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
* In 1959, Fleischer was awarded the [[Israel Prize]], for literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashyat |title=Israel Prize recipients in 1959 (in Hebrew) |publisher=Israel Prize Official Site |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307203909/http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashyat |archivedate=March 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily for his poem “Massa Gog”.
* In 1986, Fleischer was awarded the [[Bialik Prize]] for Jewish thought.&lt;ref name=bialik&gt;{{Cite web|title=List of Bialik Prize recipients 1933–2004 (in Hebrew), Tel Aviv Municipality website |url=http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/Hebrew/_MultimediaServer/Documents/12516738.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217143811/http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/Hebrew/_MultimediaServer/Documents/12516738.pdf |archivedate=2007-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1992, he was awarded the [[Rothschild Prize]], for Jewish studies.

The '''heritage preservation system of South Korea''' is a multi-level program aiming to preserve and cultivate Korean cultural heritage. The program is administered by the [[Cultural Heritage Administration of Korea|Cultural Heritage Administration]] (CHA; 대한민국 문화재청, Daehan Minguk Munhwa Jaecheong), and the legal framework is provided by the Cultural Heritage Protection Act of 1962, last updated in 2012. The program started in 1962 and has gradually been extended and upgraded since then.

The CHA classifies cultural heritage into five major categories (state-designated heritage, [[Cities of South Korea|city]] and [[Provinces of South Korea|province]]-designated heritage, cultural heritage material, registered cultural heritage, undesignated cultural heritage) and these are divided further into subcategories. Besides tangible cultural heritage, South Korea aims to preserve its intangible cultural heritage as well, including folk customs, music, dance and handicraft. The program also includes [[Living National Treasure (South Korea)|Living National Treasures]], persons who possess the knowledge and skills important to pass down [[Intangible Cultural Property (South Korea)|intangible cultural heritage]] to new generations. South Korea has founded several educational centers throughout the country and established [[Korea National University of Cultural Heritage|a university]], specifically dedicated to heritage preservation.

Some of the heritage properties of [[South Korea]] has been inscribed into various [[UNESCO]] lists. As of 2014, the country has nine cultural and one natural [[List of World Heritage Sites in South Korea|World Heritage Sites]], with 15 added to the provisional list; and there are 17 items registered as UNESCO [[intangible cultural heritage]].

Although the program is considered successful by both the public and experts, there are unresolved issues regarding the system and particularly the selection method of "living national treasure" holders.

==The Cultural Heritage Administration==
{{main|Cultural Heritage Administration of Korea}}

The program is administered by the Cultural Heritage Administration (CHA; 대한민국 문화재청, Daehan Minguk Munhwa Jaecheong),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/english/qa/faq_03.jsp?mc=EN_08_01|title=What is the Job of the Cultural Heritage Administration?|publisher=Cultural Heritage Administration, Republic of Korea|accessdate=2013-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the predecessor of which was founded in 1945 by the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea|American military government of Korea]]. It first belonged to the [[Ministry of Education (South Korea)|Ministry of Education]], then to the [[Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism|Ministry of Culture]]. Between 1999 and 2004 it functioned as an independent agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/english/about_new/history.jsp?mc=EN_02_05|title=History|publisher=Cultural Heritage Administration|accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CHA administers the [[National Palace Museum of Korea]] as well as various 'palace offices' and 'shrine offices'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/english/about_new/organization.jsp?mc=EN_02_06|title=Organizational Chart|publisher=Cultural Heritage Administration|accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also responsible for the [[Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty]], which are part of the UNESCO World Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/english/royal_palaces_new/royal_tombs.jsp?mc=EN_05_02|title=Royal Tombs|accessdate=2013-07-22|publisher=Cultural Heritage Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CHA established [[Korea National University of Cultural Heritage]] in 2000, which specifically educates professionals for heritage preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.nuch.ac.kr/CmsHome/abo0101.aspx|title=Overview|publisher=Korea National University of Cultural Heritage|accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1999 the South Korean government founded 27 educational centers for cultivating intangible cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accu.or.jp/ich/en/policies/C_KOR.html|title=Korea|publisher=Asia/Pacific Cultural Centre for UNESCO|accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The administrator of CHA is [[Byeon Youngseop]], professor of history at [[Korea University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/english/about_new/profile.jsp?mc=EN_02_01_02|title=Administrator|accessdate=2013-07-16|publisher=Cultural Heritage Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual budget of the administration was 615 billion won in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/english/about_new/budget.jsp?mc=EN_02_08|title=Budget|accessdate=2013-07-16|publisher=Cultural Heritage Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal framework for the heritage program is provided by the Cultural Heritage Protection Act of 1962&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=12943|title=Cultural Heritage Protection Act (Act No. 961 of January 10, 1962, as amended up to Act No. 10000 of February 4, 2010)|publisher=[[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]]|accessdate=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (문화재보호법, Munhwajae Bohobeop), last updated in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/lsInfoP.do?lsiSeq=122422#0000|script-title=ko:문화재보호법|publisher=Korea Ministry of Government Legislation|accessdate=2014-05-30|language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Korea-Andong-Dano Festival-Seesawing-01.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Nolttwigi]]'']]

The legal framework of cultural heritage preservation is based on the number 961 Law of 1962 (문화재보호법 Munhwajae Bohobeop), which in turn is based on the similar Japanese act of 1950. The Korean act is broader in scope, also extending to folklore. The act was amended in 1970 not only to include people (인간문화재, ingan munhwajae, "human cultural heritage") but also to support them financially.&lt;ref name="Maliangkay"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archivalplatform.org/blog/entry/south_koreas_heritage_scheme/|title=Reflections on South Korea’s 1962 heritage scheme|date=2009-10-13|publisher=The Archival Platform|author=Roald Maliangkay|accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the program, after the [[Korean War]], the CHA had little means to operate. Go Sangnyeol (고상렬), the administrator of CHA between 1961 and 1968 set out to search for intangible cultural properties on the basis of a series of articles written by Yae Yonghae (예용해) for [[Hankook Ilbo]], as the reporter spent years in exploring the country and interviewing old masters of handicraft. The first items to be inscribed on the intangible heritage list were thus taken from Yae's articles. Others were added based on the opinions of researchers and also included winners of the annual folk tradition competitions. The recommendation of local administrations was also sought.&lt;ref name="koreana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx=2243&amp;lang=en&amp;page_type=list |title=Fifty Years of Endeavors for Preservation and Transmission |publisher=Koreana |author=Suh Heun-gang, Ahn Hong-beom |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531124737/http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx=2243&amp;lang=en&amp;page_type=list |archivedate=2014-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korea introduced a unique system in the 1970s to preserve folk traditions (including handicraft, arts, folk songs, folk dances, theatre, traditional food preparation techniques, etc.). This was triggered by a movement called [[New Community Movement|New Community]], aiming to modernize life in the countryside. In an attempt to get rid of old superstitions, the movement advocated cutting down the old [[Zelkova]] trees often found at village entrances, as they were believed to be 'protectors' of the village according to tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx%3D2243%26lang%3Den%26page_type%3Dlist |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531124737/http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx=2243&amp;lang=en&amp;page_type=list |archivedate=2014-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, the songs of the ''[[haenyo]]'', or "sea women" of [[Jeju Island]] were declared provincial intangible cultural properties.&lt;ref name="koreana" /&gt;

Major stakeholders of the intangible heritage program are "living national treasures"&lt;ref name="koreana" /&gt; or officially called "holders" (보유자 boyuja),&lt;ref name="Maliangkay"/&gt; people who possess knowledge or skills essential for preserving Korean culture. Some of these 'holders' obtained significant national exposure or fame,&lt;ref name="koreana" /&gt; for example [[Han Bongnyeo]] (한복려), a holder for the [[Korean royal court cuisine]] who supervises the authentic presentation of [[Joseon Dynasty]] food in [[Korean drama|historical movies and television series]].&lt;ref name="hancinema"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hancinema.net/special-interview--han-bok-ryeo-master-of-korean-royal-cuisine-21540.html|title=Special Interview - Han Bok-Ryeo, Master of Korean Royal Cuisine|date=2009-12-07|publisher=Hancinema|accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ktinterjú"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2008/03/135_21068.html|title=Vive La Korean Food! Hallyu Revitalizes Culinary Tradition|publisher=The Korea Times|date=2008-03-20|accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UNESCO]] [[Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage]] took place in 2003 and South Korea joined the program a year later. In 2005 [[China]] declared some 1200 properties as intangible cultural heritage, with 16 items belonging to the [[Koreans in China|Korean minority]] of the country, including the [[Marriage in South Korea|traditional wedding ceremony]], ''[[Arirang]]'' (a folk song) and ''[[nolttwigi]]'' (a traditional seesaw game). The CHA decided that they also had to broaden the scope of intangible heritage to properties that do not have any designated 'holders', like [[kimchi]], [[hangul]] or [[Goryeo]] [[ginseng]].&lt;ref name="koreana" /&gt;

The CHA opened its World Intangible Heritage Complex in [[Jeonju]], which also functions as a national centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nihc.go.kr/english/html/content.html?menu=01_01.html |publisher=WITH |title=Greeting |accessdate=2017-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex has an area of {{convert|59930|m²}} and was constructed from 66 million USD.&lt;ref name="koreana" /&gt;

In 2017, the CHA decided to widen the range of possible cultural assets, including objects younger tha 50 years. Thus items like [[Yuna Kim]]'s skates she wore at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] and the first train operated by the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]] in 1974 are also designated as cultural assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2017/01/516_221705.html|title=Kim Yu-na's skates to be designated cultural assets|publisher=The Korea Times|accessdate=2017-01-10|date=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The cultural heritage program of South Korea is generally considered a success both by academics and the public, however, a few issues remain to be addressed.&lt;ref name="Maliangkay" /&gt; One of them is the selection process of the "holders", as the prestige and state support of the position creates high competition between folk artists to be selected. According to Choi Sung-ja, a member of the Intangible Cultural Heritage Subcommittee, the intangible cultural heritage program should not be tied exclusively to the existence of "holders", and a less subjective selection process should be introduced. Since 2009 the CHA changed its selection process by involving academic professionals to introduce a more objective evaluation system of "holders".&lt;ref name="koreana" /&gt;

Changes in society also brought challenges to the program. For example, in the 1990s Christian groups started to question the need to classify [[shaman]]istic rituals as cultural heritage. Patriarchal lifestyle, where the man is the main provider of the family and women stay at home, also influenced "holders", as housewives started to pick up the preservation of folk traditions also in areas that were previously dominated by men. The government resisted appointing female holders for such predominantly male traditions but was gradually forced to acknowledge them when there were no male practitioners at all, or where the women were significantly more talented than the men.&lt;ref name="Maliangkay" /&gt;

According to Roald Maliangkay of The Australian National University, the program faces challenges from the [[Korean Wave]], as well. As Korean culture is becoming more popular worldwide, due to the influence of television series and [[K-pop]], South Korea started to use its culture as a means of [[soft power]], involving its cultural heritage, too.&lt;ref name="Maliangkay" /&gt; Maliangkay thinks that

{{quote|"...a society’s image abroad is not shaped entirely by cultural activities. It is, instead, shaped by the combined total of what people abroad see and hear, and what they know about aspects they consider important, whether those are positive or not. [...] Even a society that cares greatly for its people and its heritage may not have a very positive image abroad, and vice versa. South Korea cannot control what people abroad will come to understand about its society and culture either.&lt;ref name="Maliangkay" /&gt;}}

{{History of Israel}}
The [[Land of Israel]] (also known as the [[Holy Land]] or [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]) is the birthplace of the [[Jews|Jewish people]], the place where the [[Hebrew Bible]] was composed and the birthplace of [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]. It contains sites sacred to [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Samaritanism]], [[Druze]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]].

The region has come under the sway of various empires and been home to a variety of ethnicities, but was predominantly [[Jews|Jewish]] from roughly 1,000 years before the Common Era (BCE) until the 3rd century of the [[Common Era|Common Era (CE)]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Chosen Few : How Education Shaped Jewish History, 70–1492, by Botticini and Eckstein, Chapter 1, especially page 17, Princeton 2012"&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of Christianity by the [[Roman Empire]] in the 4th century led to a Greco-Roman Christian majority which lasted until the 7th century when the area was conquered by the [[Caliphate|Arab Muslim Empires]]. It gradually became predominantly Muslim until the [[Crusades]] between 1096 and 1291, when it was the focal point of conflict between Christianity and Islam. From the 13th century it was mainly Muslim with Arabic as the dominant language and was first part of the Syrian province of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] and then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|British conquest in 1917]]. 

A Jewish national movement, [[Zionism]], emerged in the late-19th century (partially in response to growing [[anti-Semitism]]), as part of which [[Aliyah]] (Jewish immigration) increased. During [[World War I]], the British government publicly committed to create a [[Jewish National Home]] and was granted a [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Mandate to rule Palestine]] by the [[League of Nations]] for this purpose. A rival [[Arab nationalism]] also claimed rights over the former Ottoman territories and sought to prevent Jewish migration into Palestine, leading to growing [[Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine|Arab–Jewish tensions]].  [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|Israeli independence]] in 1948 was accompanied by an exodus of [[1948 Palestinian exodus|Arabs]] from Israel, the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/Declaration+of+Establishment+of+State+of+Israel.htm |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |title=Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel |date=14 May 1948 |accessdate=16 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321213130/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/Declaration%20of%20Establishment%20of%20State%20of%20Israel.htm |archivedate=21 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a subsequent [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]] and [[Bricha|Europe]] to Israel. About 43% of the [[Jewish population by country|world's Jews]] live in Israel today, the largest Jewish community in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=DellaPergola, Sergio |date=2015 |title=World Jewish Population, 2015 |url=http://www.jewishdatabank.org/Studies/downloadFile.cfm?FileID=3394 |publisher=Berman Jewish DataBank |accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since about 1970, the [[United States]] has become the principal [[Israel–United States relations|ally of Israel]]. In 1979, an uneasy [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]] was signed, based on the [[Camp David Accords]]. In 1993, Israel signed [[Oslo I Accord]] with the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], followed by establishment of the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and in 1994 [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]] was signed. Despite [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process|efforts to finalize the peace agreement]], the conflict continues to play a major role in Israeli and international political, social and economic life. 

The [[economy of Israel]] was initially primarily socialist and the country dominated by social democratic parties until the 1970s. Since then the Israeli economy has gradually moved to capitalism and a free market economy, partially retaining the social welfare system.

[[File:Skhul Cave.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Es Skhul]] cave]]
Between 2.6 and 0.9 million years ago, at least four episodes of [[hominine]] dispersal from Africa to the Levant are known, each culturally distinct. The oldest evidence of [[early humans]] in the territory of modern Israel, dating to 1.5 million years ago, was found in [[Ubeidiya]] near the [[Sea of Galilee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tchernov |first=Eitan |author-link=Eitan Tchernov |date=1988 |title=The Age of 'Ubeidiya Formation (Jordan Valley, Israel) and the Earliest Hominids in the Levant |url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/paleo_0153-9345_1988_num_14_2_4455 |journal=[[Paléorient]] |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=63–65 |doi=10.3406/paleo.1988.4455 |access-date=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flint tool artefacts have been discovered at [[Yiron]], the oldest stone tools found anywhere outside Africa.

===Canaanites (Bronze Age)===
{{Main|Canaan|Djahy}}
During the 2nd millennium BCE, [[Canaan]], part of which later became known as Israel, was dominated by the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] from c.1550 to c. 1180.

===Early Israelites (Iron Age I)===
{{Main|Hebrews|Israelites|Biblical judges}}
{{See also|Origins of Judaism|Biblical archaeology|The Bible and history}}
[[File:Merneptah Israel Stele Cairo.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Merneptah Stele]]. While alternative translations exist, the majority of [[Biblical Archeology|biblical archaeologists]] translate a set of hieroglyphs as "Israel," representing the first instance of the name in the historical record.]]
The first record of the name Israel (as ''{{lang|egy-Latn|ysrỉꜣr}}'') occurs in the [[Merneptah stele]], erected for Egyptian Pharaoh [[Merneptah]] (son of [[Ramses II]]) c. 1209 BCE, "Israel is laid waste and his seed is not."&lt;ref&gt;Stager in Coogan 1998, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William G. Dever]] sees this "Israel" in the central highlands as a cultural and probably political entity, more an ethnic group rather than an organized state.&lt;ref&gt;Dever 2003, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancestors of the Israelites may have included [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semites]] native to [[Canaan]] and the [[Sea Peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1986, pp. 78–9.&lt;/ref&gt; McNutt says, "It is probably safe to assume that sometime during [[Iron Age]] I a population began to identify itself as 'Israelite'", differentiating itself from the [[Canaanites]] through such markers as the prohibition of intermarriage, an emphasis on family history and genealogy, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;McNutt 1999, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeological evidence indicates a society of village-like centres, but with more limited resources and a small population.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman in Vaughn 1992, pp. 156–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Villages had populations of up to 300 or 400,&lt;ref name=mcnutt70&gt;McNutt 1999, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2005, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; which lived by farming and herding, and were largely self-sufficient;&lt;ref&gt;McNutt 1999, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; economic interchange was prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2005, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing was known and available for recording, even in small sites.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2005, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

====First Hebrew texts and religion====
The first use of [[grapheme]]-based [[Proto-Sinaitic script|writing originated in the area]], probably among Canaanite peoples resident in Egypt. This evolved into the [[Phoenician alphabet]] from which all modern [[Alphabet|alphabetical writing systems]] are descended. The [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]] was one of the first to develop and evidence of its use exists from about 1000 BCE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1308-alphabet-the-hebrew|title=ALPHABET, THE HEBREW - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see the [[Gezer calendar]]), the language spoken was probably [[Biblical Hebrew]].

[[Monotheism]], the belief in a single all-powerful law-giving God is thought to have evolved among the Hebrew speakers gradually, over the next few centuries, from a number of separate cults,&lt;ref&gt;Othmar Keel, Christoph Uehlinger, Gods, Goddesses, and Images of God in Ancient Israel, Fortress Press (1998); Mark S. Smith, The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel’s Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts, Oxford University Press (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the first versions of the religion now known as [[Judaism]].

===Israel and Judah (Iron Age II)===
{{Main|Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Judah}}
[[File:Ir-david03.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[City of David]] in Jerusalem]]
The [[Hebrew Bible]] describes constant warfare between the [[Israelites]] and the [[Philistines]] whose capital was [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. The Phillistines were Greek refugee-settlers who inhabited the southern Levantine coast.&lt;ref&gt; Ann E. Killebrew, Biblical Peoples and Ethnicity: An Archaeological Study of Egyptians, Canaanites, Philistines, and Early Israel, 1300–1100 B.C.E, Society of Biblical Lit, 2005 p.230.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bible states that [[King David]] founded a dynasty of kings and that his son [[Solomon]] built a [[Solomon's Temple|temple]]. Both David and Solomon are widely referenced in Jewish, Christian and Islamic texts. Standard Biblical chronology suggests that around 930 BCE, following the death of Solomon, the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|kingdom]] split into a southern [[Kingdom of Judah]] and a northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]]. The Bible's [[Books of Kings]] state that soon after the split Pharoh "[[Shishaq]]" invaded the country [[Sack of Jerusalem (10th century BC)|plundering Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2 Chronicles|12|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription over a [[Bubastite Portal|gate at Karnak]] in Egypt recounts such an invasion by Pharoh [[Sheshonq I]].&lt;ref&gt;Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, page 335, Oxford 2000&lt;/ref&gt; 

The archaeological evidence for this period is extremely sparse, leading some scholars to suggest that this section of the Hebrew Bible, which includes texts written two centuries later, exaggerates the importance of David and Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/1.818795, "The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Sacred Texts" by Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman, Free Press 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest references to the "[[Davidic Dynasty|House of David]]" have been found in two inscriptions, on the [[Tel Dan Stele]] and the [[Mesha Stele]]; the latter is a [[Moab]]ite stele, now in the Louvre, which describes an 840 BCE invasion of Moab by [[Omri]], king of Israel. [[Jehu]], son of Omri, is referenced by [[Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III|Assyrian records]] (now in the British Museum). Modern archaeological findings show that Omri's capital city, [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]], was large and Finkelstein has suggested that the Biblical account of David and Solomon are an attempt by later Judean rulers to ascribe Israel's successes to their dynasty.

==== Assyrian invasions ====
[[File:Kingdoms of Israel and Judah map 830.svg|thumb|upright|Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]]]
In 854 BCE, according to Assyrian records (the [[Kurkh Monoliths]])&lt;ref&gt;Kurkh stela: https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=367117&amp;partId=1 For original inscription see http://rbedrosian.com/Downloads3/ancient_records_assyria1.pdf page 223&lt;/ref&gt; an alliance between [[Ahab]] of Israel and Ben Hadad II of [[Aram Damascus]] managed to repulse the incursions of the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], with a victory at the [[Battle of Qarqar]]. This is not included in the Bible which describes conflict between Ahab and Ben Hadad.&lt;ref&gt;Kings 1 chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt; Around 750 BCE, the Kingdom of Israel was destroyed by [[Assyria]]n king [[Tiglath-Pileser III]].&lt;ref&gt;Kings 2 chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; The Philistine kingdom was also destroyed. The Assyrians sent most of the population of the northern Israelite kingdom into [[Assyrian captivity of Israel|exile]], thus creating the "[[Lost Tribes of Israel]]". The [[Samaritan]]s claim to be descended from survivors of the Assyrian conquest. An Israelite revolt (724–722 BCE) was crushed after the siege and capture of [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]] by the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]]. 

Modern scholars believe that refugees from the destruction of Israel moved to Judah, massively expanding Jerusalem and leading to construction of the [[Siloam Tunnel]] during the rule of King [[Hezekiah]] (ruled 715–686 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Broshi |first=Maguen |title=Bread, Wine, Walls and Scrolls |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=etTUEorS1zMC&amp;pg=PA174|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2001 |page=174 |isbn=1841272019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tunnel could provide water during a siege and its construction is described in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2 Kings|20:20|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Siloam inscription|Hebrew plaque]] left by the construction team still exists.

Sargon's son, [[Sennacherib]], tried and failed to [[Sennacherib's campaign in Judah|conquer]] Judah, during Hezekiah's reign. [[Taylor prism|Assyrian records]] say that Sennacherib leveled 46 walled cities and [[Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem|besieged Jerusalem]], leaving after receiving extensive tribute. The Bible also refers to tribute,&lt;ref&gt;Kings 2, chapter 18&lt;/ref&gt; and suggests that Hezekiah was aided by [[Taharqa]], king of Kush ([[Nubia]]), in repulsing the Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2 Kings|19:9|NASB}}, see also "The Rescue of Jerusalem: The Alliance between Hebrews and Africans in 701 BC" by Henry Aubin, Random House 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Sennacherib had a 12 meter by 5 meter frieze [[Lachish reliefs|erected in his palace]] in [[Nineveh]] (now in [[Iraq]]) depicting his victory at [[Lachish]], the second largest city in Judah.

The Bible describes a tradition of religious men ("[[prophets]]") exercising some form of [[free speech]] and criticizing rulers. The most famous of these was [[Isaiah]], who witnessed the Assyrian invasion and warned of its consequences.

Under King [[Josiah]] (ruler from 641 - 619), the book of [[Deuteronomy]] was either rediscovered or written. The [[Book of Joshua]] and the accounts of the kingship of David and Solomon in the [[Books of Kings|book of Kings]] are believed to have the same author. The books are known as [[Deuteronomist]] and considered to be a key step in the emergence of [[Monotheism]] in Judah. They emerged at a time that Assyria was weakened by the emergence of Babylon and may be a committing to text of pre-writing verbal traditions.&lt;ref&gt;The Social Roots of Biblical Yahwism by Stephen Cook, SBL 2004 pp 58&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:מסע גולי בבל.jpg|thumb|The route of the exiles to Babylon]]
In 586 BCE King [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] of [[Babylon]] [[Jewish–Babylonian war|conquered]] Judah. According to the Hebrew Bible, he destroyed [[Solomon's Temple]] and [[Babylonian captivity|exiled]] the Jews to Babylon. The Phillistines were also driven into exile. The defeat of Judah was recorded by the Babylonians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/c/cuneiform_nebuchadnezzar_ii.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030154541/https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/c/cuneiform_nebuchadnezzar_ii.aspx |archivedate=30 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc5/jerusalem.html reverse side, line 12.&lt;/ref&gt; (see the [[Babylonian Chronicles]]). Babylonian and Biblical sources suggest that the Judean king, [[Jehoiachin]], switched allegiances between the Egyptians and the Babylonians and that invasion was a punishment for allying with Babylon's principal rival, Egypt. The exiled Jews may have been restricted to the elite. Jehoiachin was eventually released by the Babylonians. Tablets which seem to describe his rations were found in the ruins of Babylon (see [[Jehoiachin's Rations Tablets]]). According to both the Bible and the Talmud, the Judean royal family (the [[Davidic line]]) continued as head of Babylonian Jewry, called the [[Exilarch|"Rosh Galut"]] (head of exile). Arab and Jewish sources show that the ''Rosh Galut'' continued to exist (in what is now Iraq) for another 1,500 years, ending in the eleventh century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peerage.org/genealogy/exilarch.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:YehudObverse 1.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Obverse of [[Yehud coinage|Yehud silver coin]]]]
In 538 BCE, [[Cyrus (Bible)|Cyrus the Great]] of [[Persia]] conquered Babylon and took over its empire. Cyrus issued a proclamation granting subjugated nations (including the people of Judah) religious freedom (for the original text see the [[Cyrus Cylinder]]). According to the Hebrew Bible 50,000 Judeans, led by [[Zerubabel]], [[Return to Zion|returned to Judah]] and [[Second Temple of Jerusalem|rebuilt the temple]]. A second group of 5,000, led by [[Ezra]] and [[Nehemiah]], returned to Judah in 456 BCE although non-Jews wrote to Cyrus to try to prevent their return. Modern scholars believe that the final Hebrew versions of the [[Torah]] and [[Books of Kings]] [[Authorship of the Bible|date from this period]], that the returning [[Israelites]] adopted an [[Aramaic script]] (also known as the [[Ashuri alphabet]]), which they brought back from Babylon; this is the current Hebrew script. The [[Hebrew Calendar]] closely resembles the [[Babylonian calendar]] and probably dates from this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/303554/Jewish-religious-year/34907/Origin-and-development|title=Jewish religious year|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 333 BCE, the [[ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] ruler [[Alexander the Great]] defeated [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] and [[Alexander the Great#Egypt|conquered]] the region. Sometime thereafter, the first translation of the Hebrew Bible, the [[Septuagint]], was begun in [[Alexandria]]. After Alexander's death, his generals fought over the territory he had conquered. Judah became the frontier between the [[Seleucid Empire]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], eventually becoming part of the Seleucid Empire in 200 BCE at the [[battle of Panium]].

===Hasmonean dynasty (140–37 BCE)===
{{Main|Hasmonean dynasty}}
[[File:Hasmoneese rijk.PNG|thumb|upright|[[Hasmonean kingdom]]]]
In the 2nd century BCE, Seleucid ruler [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] tried to eradicate Judaism in favour of [[Hellenistic religion]]. This provoked the 174–135 BCE [[Maccabean Revolt]] led by [[Judas Maccabeus]] (whose victory is celebrated in the Jewish festival of [[Hanukkah]]). The [[Books of the Maccabees]] describe the uprising and the end of Greek rule.
 
A Jewish party called the [[Hasideans]] opposed both Hellenism ''and'' the revolt, but eventually gave their support to the Maccabees. Modern interpretations see the initial stages of the uprising as a civil war between Hellenised and orthodox forms of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/life/faithbased/2005/12/the_maccabees_and_the_hellenists.html |title= The Maccabees and the Hellenists |last= Ponet |first= James |date= 22 December 2005 |work= Faith-based |publisher= Slate |access-date=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="simpletoremember"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/the_revolt_of_the_maccabees/ |title= The Revolt of the Maccabees |publisher= Simpletoremember.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hasmonean]] dynasty of Jewish [[Kohen Gadol|priest-kings]] ruled [[Judea]] with the [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]] and [[Essenes]] as the principal Jewish social movements. As part of the struggle against [[Hellenistic civilisation]], the Pharisee leader [[Simeon ben Shetach]] established the first schools based around [[synagogue|meeting houses]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]], ''History of the Jews'', p. 106, Harper 1988&lt;/ref&gt; This led to [[Rabbinical Judaism]]. Justice was administered by the [[Sanhedrin]], which was a Rabbincal assembly and law court whose leader was known as the [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]]. The Nasi's religious authority gradually superseded that of the Temple's [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]], who under the Hasmoneans was the king himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Testament History - The Hasmonean kingdom |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/biblical-literature/New-Testament-history#ref73410 |website=www.britannica.com |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hasmoneans continually extended their control over much of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=MA-4VX5gWS4C&amp;pg=PA210&amp;lpg=PA210 |title= Cambridge History of Judaism, The early Roman period |volume= 2 |pages= 195, 196, 204 |contribution= The Gentiles in Judaism, 125 BCE – 66 CE |last= Smith |first= Morton |date= 1999 |isbn= 0521243777 |editor1-last= Horbury |editor1-first= William |editor2-first=W. D. |editor2-last= Davies |editor3-first= John |editor3-last = Sturdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 125 BCE the Hasmonean [[ethnarch]] [[John Hyrcanus]] subjugated [[Edom]] and forcibly converted its population to [[Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |url= http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7972-hyrcanus-john-johanan-i |title=Hyrcanus, John (Johanan) I.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyrcanus' son [[Alexander Jannaeus]] established good relations with the [[Roman Republic]], however there was growing tension between Pharisees and Sadducces and a conflict over the succession to Janneus, in which the warring parties invited foreign intervention on their behalf.

==Roman period (64 BCE–4th century CE)==
{{Further|History of the Jews in the Roman Empire}}
In 64 BCE the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] general [[Pompey#Pompey in the East|Pompey]] [[Third Mithridatic War|conquered]] Syria and [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|intervened]] in the [[Hasmonean civil war]] in Jerusalem. During the [[Siege of Alexandria (47 BC)|siege of Alexandria in 47 BCE]], the lives of [[Julius Caesar]] and his protege [[Cleopatra]] were saved by 3,000 Jewish troops sent by King [[Hyrcanus II]] and commanded by [[Antipater the Idumaean|Antipater]], whose descendants Caesar made kings of Judea.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar: The Life and Times of the People's Dictator By Luciano Canfora chapter 24 "Caesar Saved by the Jews".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herodian dynasty and Roman province===
{{Main|Herodian dynasty|Herodian kingdom|Herodian Tetrarchy|Judea (Roman province)}}
[[File:Temple Scroll.png|thumb|upright|Portion of the [[Temple Scroll]], one of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] written by the Essenes]]
From 37 BCE to 6 CE, the [[Herodian dynasty]], Jewish-Roman client kings, descended from Antipater, ruled Judea. [[Herod the Great]] considerably enlarged the temple (see [[Herod's Temple]]), making it one of the largest religious structures in the world. Despite its fame, it was in this period that [[Rabbinical Judaism]], led by [[Hillel the Elder]], began to assume popular prominence over the [[Kohen|Temple priesthood]]. The [[Second Temple|Jewish Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]] was granted special permission not to display an effigy of the emperor, becoming the only religious structure in the [[Roman Empire]] that did not do so. Special dispensation was granted for Jewish citizens of the Roman Empire to pay a [[Fiscus Judaicus|tax to the temple]].

[[Augustus]] made Judea a Roman province in 6 CE, deposing the last Jewish king, [[Herod Archelaus]], and appointing a Roman governor.  There was a small revolt against Roman taxation led by [[Judas of Galilee]] and over the next decades tensions grew between the Greco-Roman and Judean population centered on attempts to place effigies of the Emperor [[Caligula]] in Synagogues and in the Jewish temple.&lt;ref&gt;Philo of Alexandria, On the Embassy to Gaius XXX.203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/josephus/ant-18.html Antiquities of the Jews by Josephus,Book 18 chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jesus]] was born in the last years of Herod's rule, probably in the Judean city of Bethlehem. Jesus is thought to have been a Galilean Jewish reformer (from [[Nazareth]]), and was executed in Jerusalem by the Roman governor [[Pontius Pilate]] between 25 and 35 CE. All his key followers, the [[Twelve Apostles]], were Jews including [[Paul the Apostle]] (5–67 CE) who took critical steps towards creating a new religion, defining Jesus as the "Son of God". In the year 50 CE, the [[Council of Jerusalem]] led by Paul, decided to abandon the Jewish requirement of circumcision and the Torah, creating a form of Judaism highly accessible to non-Jews and with a more [[Universalism|universal notion of God]]. Another Jewish follower, [[Saint Peter|Peter]] is believed to have become the first Pope.

In 64 CE, the Temple High Priest [[Joshua ben Gamla]] introduced a religious requirement for Jewish boys to learn to read from the age of six. Over the next few hundred years this requirement became steadily more ingrained in Jewish tradition.&lt;ref&gt;The Chosen Few: How education shaped Jewish History, Botticini and Eckstein, Princeton 2012, page 71 and chapters 4 and 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish–Roman wars===
{{Main|Jewish–Roman wars|Syria Palaestina}}
[[File:Arch of Titus Menorah.png|thumb|right|[[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)]]]]
In 66 CE, the Jews of Judea rose in [[First Jewish–Roman War|revolt]] against Rome, naming their new state as "Israel".&lt;ref&gt;Martin Goodman, ''Rome and Jerusalem: The Clash of Ancient Civilizations'', Penguin 2008 pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; The events were described by the Jewish leader and historian [[Josephus]], including the defence of [[Siege of Yodfat|Jotapata]], the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|siege of Jerusalem]] (69–70 CE) and the desperate last stand at [[Siege of Masada|Masada]] under [[Eleazar ben Yair]] (72–73 CE).

Josephus estimated that over a million people died in the siege of Jerusalem. The Temple and most of Jerusalem was destroyed. During the Jewish revolt, most [[History of Christianity|Christians]], at this time a sub-sect of Judaism, removed themselves from Judea. The rabbinical/[[Pharisee]] movement led by [[Yochanan ben Zakai]], who opposed the [[Sadducee]] temple priesthood, made peace with Rome and survived. After the war [[Taxation of the Jews|Jews continued to be taxed]] in the [[Fiscus Judaicus]], which was used to fund a temple to Jupiter. A [[Arch of Titus|victory arch]] erected in Rome can still be seen today.

Tensions and attacks on Jews around the Roman Empire led to a massive Jewish uprising against Rome from 115 to 117. Jews in Libya, Egypt, Cyprus and Mesopotamia [[Kitos War|fought against Rome]]. This conflict was accompanied by large-scale massacres of both sides. Cyprus was so severely depopulated that new settlers were imported and Jews banned from living there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/68*.html |title=Cassius Dio — Epitome of Book 68 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 131, the Emperor [[Hadrian]] renamed Jerusalem "[[Aelia Capitolina]]" and constructed a Temple of Jupiter on the site of the former Jewish temple. Jews were banned from living in Jerusalem itself (a ban that persisted until the Arab conquest), and the Roman province, until then known as [[Iudaea Province]], was renamed [[Syria Palaestina|Palaestina]], no other revolt led to a province being renamed.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Goodman, ''Rome and Jerusalem: The Clash of Ancient Civilizations'', Penguin 2008 p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; The names "Palestine" (in English) and "Filistin" (in Arabic) are derived from this.

From 132 to 136, the Jewish leader [[Simon Bar Kokhba]] led another major [[Bar Kokhba revolt|revolt]] against the Romans, again renaming the country "Israel"&lt;ref&gt;Martin Goodman, ''Rome and Jerusalem: The Clash of Ancient Civilizations'', Penguin 2008 p. 490&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Bar Kochba Revolt coinage]]). The Bar-Kochba revolt probably caused more trouble for the Romans than the better documented revolt of 70.&lt;ref&gt;M. Avi-Yonah, ''The Jews under Roman and Byzantine Rule'', Jerusalem 1984 pp. 12–14&lt;/ref&gt; Christians refused to participate in the revolt and from this point the Jews regarded Christianity as a separate religion.&lt;ref&gt;M. Avi-Yonah, ''The Jews under Roman and Byzantine Rule'', Jerusalem 1984 p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt was eventually crushed by [[Emperor Hadrian]] himself. During the Bar Kokhba revolt a [[Council of Jamnia|rabbinical assembly decided]] which [[Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|books could be regarded]] as part of the [[Hebrew Bible]]: the [[Jewish apocrypha]] and Christian books were excluded.&lt;ref&gt;For more information see ''The Canon Debate'' edited by McDonald and Sanders, 2002 Hendrickson&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the original text of some Hebrew texts, including the [[Books of Maccabees]] were lost (Greek translations survived).

A rabbi of this period, [[Simeon bar Yochai]], is regarded as the author of the [[Zohar]], the foundational text for Kabbalistic thought. However, modern scholars believe it was written in Medieval Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Jacobs|first=Joseph|author2=Broydé, Isaac|encyclopedia=Jewish Encyclopedia|title=Zohar|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=142&amp;letter=Z#406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the 136 CE Jewish defeat===
After suppressing the Bar Kochba revolt, the Romans [[Jewish diaspora|exiled]] the Jews of Judea, but not of Galilee and permitted a hereditary Rabbinical Patriarch (from the [[House of Hillel]], based in Galilee) to represent the Jews in dealings with the Romans. The most famous of these was [[Judah haNasi]] who is credited with compiling the final version of the [[Mishnah]] (a massive body of Jewish religious texts interpreting the Bible) and with strengthening the educational demands of Judaism by requiring that illiterate Jews be treated as outcasts. As a result, many illiterate Jews may have converted to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;The Chosen Few: How education shaped Jewish History, Botticini and Eckstein, Princeton 2012, page 116&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish seminaries, such as those at [[Shefaram]] and [[Bet Shearim]] continued to produce scholars and the best of these became members of the [[Sanhedrin]],&lt;ref&gt;M.

Avi-Yonah, ''The Jews under Roman and Byzantine Rule'', Jerusalem 1984 chapter I&lt;/ref&gt; In the Galillee, many synagogues have been found dating from this period. However, [[Crisis of the Third Century|economic mismanagement of the Roman economy]] in the third century led to a collapse of Roman trade and empire, as well as increased taxation and persecution,&lt;ref&gt;http://money.visualcapitalist.com/currency-and-the-collapse-of-the-roman-empire/&lt;/ref&gt; which caused most Jews to migrate to the more tolerant Persian [[Sassanid Empire]], where a prosperous Jewish community with [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|extensive seminaries]] existed in the area of Babylon.

===Rome adopts Christianity===
Early in the 4th century, the Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] made [[Constantinople]] the capital of the [[East Roman Empire]] and made [[Christianity]] the official religion. His mother, [[Helena (empress)|Helena]] made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem (326–328) and led the construction of the [[Church of the Nativity]] (Bethlehem), the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] (Jerusalem) and other key churches that still exist. The name Jerusalem was restored to Aelia Capitolina and it became a Christian city. Jews were still banned from living in Jerusalem, but were allowed to visit, and it is in this period that the surviving [[Western Wall]] of the Temple became sacred to Judaism.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

In 351–2, another [[Jewish revolt against Gallus|Jewish revolt]] in the Galilee erupted against a corrupt Roman governor.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/jewish/lazare-anti.asp Antisemitism: Its History and Causes]'' by [[Bernard Lazare]], 1894. Accessed January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 362, the last [[pagan]] Roman Emperor, [[Julian the Apostate]], announced plans to rebuild the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jewish Temple]]. He died while fighting the Persians in 363 and the project was discontinued.

==Byzantine period (390–634)==
{{Main|Palaestina Prima|Palaestina Secunda}}
{{further|Jewish revolt against Heraclius|Rabbinic Judaism|Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem}}
The Roman Empire split in 390 CE and the region became part of the (Christian) East Roman Empire, known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Byzantine Christianity was dominated by the (Greek) [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] whose massive land ownership has extended into the present. In the 5th century, the [[Western Roman Empire]] collapsed leading to Christian migration into the Roman province of [[Palaestina Prima]] and development of a Christian majority. Jews numbered 10–15% of the population, concentrated largely in the Galilee.  Judaism was the only non-Christian religion tolerated, but restrictions on Jews slowly increased to include a ban on building new places of worship, holding public office or owning slaves. In 425, following the death of the last Nasi, [[Gamliel VI]], the [[Sanhedrin]] was officially abolished and the title of [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]] banned. Several [[Samaritan Revolts]] erupted in this period,&lt;ref&gt;M. Avi-Yonah, ''The Jews under Roman and Byzantine Rule'', Jerusalem 1984 chapters XI–XII&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the decrease of Samaritan community from about a million to a near extinction. Sacred Jewish texts written in Palestine at this time are the [[Gemara]] (400), the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (500) and the [[Passover Haggadah]].

In 495 [[Mar-Zutra II]] (the [[Exilarch]]), set up an independent Jewish city-state in what is now Iraq. It lasted seven years and after its fall, his son [[Mar-Zutra III]] moved to Tiberias where he became head of the local religious academy in 520.

The [[Menorah (Temple)|Jewish Menorah]], which the Romans took when the temple was destroyed, was reportedly taken to Carthage by the [[Vandals]] after the [[Sack of Rome (455)|sacking of Rome]] in 455. According to the Byzantine historian, [[Procopius]], the [[Byzantine army]] recovered it in 533 and brought it to [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, ''Vandal Wars'', [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16765/16765-h/16765-h.htm#PageIV_ix_4 Book IV. ix. 5.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 611, [[Sassanid Persia]] [[Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628|invaded]] the Byzantine Empire and, after a long siege, [[Khosrau II]] [[Siege of Jerusalem (614)|captured Jerusalem]] in 614, with [[Revolt against Heraclius|Jewish help]], including possibly the Jewish [[Himyarite Kingdom]] in Yemen. Jews briefly governed Jerusalem when the Persians took over. The Byzantine Emperor, [[Heraclius]], promised to restore Jewish rights and received Jewish help in defeating the Persians, but reneged on the agreement after reconquering Palaestina Prima, massacring the Jews in Palestine,&lt;ref&gt;Heraclius, Emperor of Byzantium
By Walter Emil Kaegi, Cambridge 2003 pp 205&lt;/ref&gt; and issuing an edict banning Judaism from the Byzantine Empire. (Egyptian) [[Coptic Christians]] took responsibility for this broken pledge and fasted in penance.&lt;ref&gt;While the Syrians and the Melchite Greeks ceased to observe the penance after the death of Heraclius; Elijah of Nisibis (''Beweis der Wahrheit des Glaubens'', translation by Horst, p. 108, Colmar, 1886) see {{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3877-byzantine-expire |title=Byzantine Expire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Arab period (634–1099) ==
{{main|Jund Filastin|Jund al-Urdunn}}
According to Muslim tradition, on the last night of his life in 620, Muhammed [[Isra and Mi'raj|was taken on spiritual journey from Mecca]] to the "farthest mosque", whose location many consider to be the [[Temple Mount]], returning the same night. In 634–636 the Arabs [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|conquered]] [[Palaestina Prima]] and renamed it [[Jund Filastin]], ending the Byzantine ban on Jews living in Jerusalem. Over the next few centuries, [[Islam]] replaced Christianity as the dominant religion of the region.

From 636 until the beginning of the Crusades, [[Jund Filastin]] was ruled first by [[Medina]]h-based [[Rashidun|Rashidun Caliphs]], then by the [[Damascus]]-based [[Umayyad Caliphate]] and after that the [[Baghdad]]-based [[Abbasid Caliphs]]. In 691, Umayyad Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] (685–705) constructed the [[Dome of the Rock]] shrine on the Temple Mount. Jews consider it to contain the [[Foundation Stone]] (see also [[Kodesh Hakodashim|Holy of Holies]]), which is the holiest site in Judaism. A second building, the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], was also erected on the Temple Mount in 705.

Between the 7th and 11th centuries, Jewish scribes, called the [[Masoretes]] and located in Galilee and Jerusalem, established the [[Masoretic Text]], the final text of the [[Hebrew Bible]].

==Crusades and Mongols (1099–1291) ==
{{main|Kingdom of Jerusalem|Maimonides}}
[[File:1099jerusalem.jpg|thumb|The [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Siege of Jerusalem]], 1099, during the [[First Crusade]]]]
In 1099, the [[First Crusade]] took Jerusalem and established a [[Catholic]] kingdom, known as the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. During the conquest, both Muslims and Jews were indiscriminately massacred or sold into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biu.ac.il/js/rennert/history_9.html Jerusalem in the Crusader Period] Jerusalem: Life throughout the ages in a holy city] David Eisenstadt, March 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pogroms of 1096|murder of Jews]] began as the Crusaders travelled across Europe and continued when they reached the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Prawer |first=Joshua |authorlink=Joshua Prawer |title=The History of the Jews in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem |year=1988 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0198225577}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashkenazi orthodox Jews still recite a [[Av HaRachamim|prayer in memory]] of the death and destruction caused by the Crusades.

Around 1180, [[Raynald of Châtillon]], ruler of [[Oultrejordain|Transjordan]], caused increasing conflict with the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] Sultan [[Saladin]] (Salah-al-Din), leading to the defeat of the Crusaders in the 1187 [[Battle of Hattin]] (above [[Tiberias]]). Saladin was able to peacefully take Jerusalem and conquered most of the former Kingdom of Jerusalem. Saladin's court physician was [[Maimonides]], a refugee from persecution in [[Córdoba, Spain]]. This was the end of the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]] and Maimonides possessed extensive knowledge of Greek and Arab medicine. His religious writings (in Hebrew and [[Judeo-Arabic]]) are still studied by Orthodox Jews. Maimonides was [[Tomb of Maimonides|buried in Tiberias]]. A Crusader state centred round [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] survived in weakened form for another century.

From 1260 to 1291 the area became the [[Mongol raids into Palestine|frontier between Mongol invaders]] ([[Franco-Mongol alliance|occasional Crusader allies]]) and the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] of Egypt. The conflict impoverished the country and severely reduced the population. Sultan [[Qutuz]] of Egypt eventually defeated the Mongols in the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] ("Goliath's spring" near [[Ein Harod]]), ending the Mongol advances, and his successors eliminated the Crusader states. The last Crusader state, the [[Kingdom of Acre]], fell in 1291, ending the Crusades.

==Mamluk period (1291–1517) ==
{{Further|Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)}}
Egyptian Mamluk sultan, [[Baibars]] (1260–1277), conquered the last outposts of Crusader rule in [[Siege of Acre (1291)|1291]]. The [[Mamluk]]s ruled Palestine until 1516, regarding it as part of [[Bilad a-Sham|Syria]]. In [[Hebron]], Baibars banned Jews from worshipping at the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] (the second-holiest site in Judaism); the ban remained in place until its conquest by Israel 700 years later.&lt;ref&gt;''International Dictionary of Historic Places: Middle East and Africa'' by Trudy Ring, Robert M. Salkin, Sharon La Boda, pp. 336–339&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mamluks, continuing the policy of the Ayyubids, made the strategic decision to destroy the coastal area and to bring desolation to many of its cities, from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] in the north to Gaza in the south. [[sea port|Ports]] were destroyed and various materials were dumped to make them inoperable. The goal was to prevent attacks from the sea, given the fear of the return of the crusaders. This had a long-term effect on those areas, which remained sparsely populated for centuries. The activity in that time concentrated more inland.&lt;ref&gt;Myriam Rosen-Ayalon, ``Between Cairo and Damascus: Rural Life and Urban Economics in the Holy Land During the Ayyuid, Maluk and Ottoman Periods'' in ''The Archaeology of Society in the Holy Land'' edited Thomas Evan Levy, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The collapse of the Crusades was followed by increased persecution and expulsions of Jews in Europe. Expulsions [[Edict of Expulsion|began in England]] (1290) and were followed by France (1306).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/gallery/expuls.HTM |title=Map of Jewish expulsions and resettlement areas in Europe. 1100–1500. |year=2005 |work=A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust |publisher=University of South Florida |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/jewish/1182-jewsfrance1.asp |title=The Expulsion of the Jews from France, 1182 CE |last=Halsall |first=Paul |year=1998 |work=Internet Jewish History Sourcebook |publisher=Fordham University |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, [[History of the Jews in Spain#Turning point (1212–1300)|persecution]] of the highly integrated and successful Jewish community began, including massacres and forced conversions. During the [[Black Death]], many Jews were murdered after being accused of poisoning wells. The completion of the [[Reconquista|Christian reconquest]] of Spain led to expulsion of the Jews of [[Alhambra decree|Spain in 1492]] and [[History of the Jews in Portugal|Portugal in 1497]]. These were the wealthiest and most integrated Jewish communities in Europe. Many Jews converted to Christianity, however many [[Marrano|secretly practised Judaism]] and prejudice against converts (regardless of their sincerity) persisted, leading many former Jews to move to the New World (see [[History of the Jews in Latin America]]). Most of the expelled [[Sephardi Jews|Spanish Jews]] moved to North Africa, [[History of the Jews in Poland|Poland]], to the Ottoman Empire and to the region of [[Bilad a-Sham]], which roughly corresponds to the ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)]]. In Italy, Jews living in the Papal States were required to live in [[ghetto]]s (see [[Cum nimis absurdum]]). The last compulsory Ghetto, [[Roman Ghetto|in Rome]], was abolished in the 1880s.

==Ottoman period (1516–1917)==
{{Further|Ottoman Syria}}
Under the Mamluks, the area was a province of [[Bilad a-Sham]] (Syria). It was [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–1517)|conquered]] by Turkish Sultan [[Selim I]] in 1516–17, becoming a part of the province of [[Ottoman Syria]] for the next four centuries, first as the [[Damascus Eyalet]] and later as the [[Syria Vilayet]] (following the [[Tanzimat]] reorganization of 1864).

===Old Yishuv===
{{Main|Old Yishuv|Spanish inquisition}}
[[File:Rabbi-Caro.jpg|thumb|upright|left|16th-century [[Safed]] rabbi [[Joseph ben Ephraim Karo|Joseph Karo]], author of the [[Shulchan Aruch|Jewish law book]]]]
Between 1535 and 1538 [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (ruled 1520 - 1566) built the current [[Walls of Jerusalem|city walls of Jerusalem]]; Jerusalem had been without walls since the early 13th century. The construction followed the historical outline of the city, but left out a key section of the [[City of David]] (today part of [[Silwan]]) and what is now known as [[Mount Zion]].
Suleiman, who massively expanded the Ottoman Empire, encouraged Jews fleeing persecution in Spain and Portugal to settle in the Ottoman Empire and his personal physician was [[Moses Hamon]], an inquisition survivor. In 1558 [[Selim II]] (1566 - 1574, successor to Suleiman) gave control of Tiberias to Doña [[Gracia Mendes Nasi]], one of the richest women in Europe and an escapee from the inquisition. She encouraged Jewish refugees to settle in the area which led to Safed becoming a centre for study of the [[Kabbalah]]. Her daughter's husband, [[Joseph Nasi]], was made governor of Tiberias and he encouraged Jewish settlement from Italy.&lt;ref&gt;The Ghetto of Venice by Riccardo Calimani, pg 94, Mondadori 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  

From the Middle Ages on, there was small scale individual Jewish migration to the [[Land of Israel]], which increased when persecution grew elsewhere. Jewish population was concentrated in [[Jerusalem]], [[Hebron]], [[Safed]] and [[Tiberias]], known in Jewish tradition as the [[Four Holy Cities]].

In 1660, a Druze [[Druze power struggle (1658–1667)#Lebanon and Galilee campaign|revolt]] led to the destruction of [[1660 destruction of Safed|Safed]] and [[1660 destruction of Tiberias|Tiberias]].&lt;ref name="Barnay, Y 1992 p. 149"&gt;Barnay, Y.

It was the time when the Jewish settlements of Galilee were destroyed by the Druze: Tiberias was completely desolate and only a few of former Safed residents had returned...."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1663 [[Sabbatai Zevi]] settled in Jerusalem, and was proclaimed as the Jewish Messiah by [[Nathan of Gaza]]. He acquired a large number of followers before going to Istanbul in 1666, where Sultan [[Suleiman II]] forced him to covert to Islam. Many of his followers converted, forming a sect that still exists in Turkey, known as the [[Dönmeh]]. In the late 18th century a local Arab ''[[sheikh]]'' [[Zahir al-Umar]] created a ''de facto'' independent Emirate in the Galilee. Ottoman attempts to subdue the Sheikh failed, but after Zahir's death the Ottomans restored their rule in the area.

In 1799 [[Napoleon]] briefly [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|occupied]] the country and [[Napoleon and the Jews#Bonaparte's proclamation to the Jews of Africa and Asia|planned a proclamation]] inviting Jews to create a state. The proclamation was shelved following his [[Siege of Acre (1799)|defeat at Acre]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Tuchman, Bible and Sword: How the British came to Palestine, Macmillan 1956, chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1831, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], an Ottoman ruler who left the Empire and tried to modernize Egypt, [[Egyptian–Ottoman War (1831–1833)|conquered]] Ottoman Syria and tried to revive and resettle much of its regions. His conscription policies led to a popular [[1834 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab revolt]] in 1834, resulting in major casualties for the local Arab peasants, and massacres of Christian and Jewish communities by the rebels. Following the revolt, Muhammad Pasha, the son of Muhammad Ali, expelled nearly 10,000 of the local peasants to Egypt, while bringing loyal Egyptian peasants and discharged soldiers to settle the coastline of Ottoman Syria. Northern [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] was settled by his Sudanese troops.

[[File:Kerem Avraham, Jewish workers.jpg|thumb|Jewish workers in [[Kerem Avraham]] neighbourhood of Jerusalem (c. 1850s)]]
In 1838 there was another [[1838 Druze revolt|revolt]] by the Druze. In 1839 [[Moses Montefiore]] met with Muhammed Pasha in Egypt and signed an agreement to establish 100–200 Jewish villages in the [[Damascus Eyalet]] of [[Ottoman Syria]],&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Tuchman, Bible and Sword: How the British came to Palestine, Macmillan 1956, page 194-5&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1840 the Egyptians withdrew before the deal was implemented, returning the area to Ottoman governorship. In 1844, Jews constituted the largest population group in Jerusalem and by 1890 an absolute majority in the city, but as a whole the Jewish population made up far less than 10% of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/israel/advocacy/how_to_respond/establishment.asp?xflag=1 |title=How to Respond to Common Misstatements About Israel |publisher=Anti-Defamation League |year=2006 |accessdate=4 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mideastweb.org/palpop.htm |title=The Population of Palestine Prior to 1948 |publisher=MidEastWeb.org |year=2005 |accessdate=4 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868, the Ottomans banished the [[Bahá'u'lláh]], one of the founders of the Bahá'í Faith, to Acre where he is buried, and the movement subsequently established its global administrative centre in nearby [[Haifa]].

===Birth of Zionism===
{{Main|History of Zionism|Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem}}
{{Aliyah}}

During the 19th century, Jews in Western Europe were increasingly granted citizenship and [[Jewish emancipation|equality before the law]]; however, in Eastern Europe, they faced growing [[History of zionism#Persecution in Russia (before the revolution)|persecution and legal restrictions]], including widespread [[pogrom]]s in which thousands were murdered, raped or lost their property. Half the world's Jews lived in the Russian Empire, where they were severely persecuted and restricted to living in the [[Pale of Settlement]].  National groups in the Empire, such as the Poles, Lithuanians and Ukrainians were agitating for independence and often regarded the Jews as undesirable aliens. The Jews were usually the only non-Christian minority and spoke a distinct language ([[Yiddish]]). An independent Jewish national movement first began to emerge in the Russian Empire and the millions of Jews who were fleeing the country (mostly to the USA) carried the seeds of this nationalism wherever they went.

In 1870, an agricultural school, the [[Mikveh Israel]], was founded near [[Jaffa]] by the [[Alliance Israelite Universelle]], a French Jewish association. In 1878, "Russian" Jewish emigrants established the village of [[Petah Tikva]], followed by [[Rishon LeZion]] in 1882. "Russian" Jews established the [[Bilu]] and [[Hovevei Zion]] ("Lovers of Zion") movements to assist settlers and these created communities that, unlike the traditional Ashkenazi-Jewish communities, sought to be self-reliant rather than dependent on donations from abroad. Existing Ashkenazi-Jewish communities were concentrated in the [[Four Holy Cities]], extremely poor and lived on donations from Europe. The new migrants created small agricultural settlements. In Jaffa a vibrant commercial community developed in which Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews inter-mingled. Many early migrants left due to difficulty finding work and the early settlements often remained dependent on foreign donations. Despite the difficulties, more settlements arose and the community grew.

The new migration was accompanied by a [[revival of the Hebrew language]] and attracted Jews of all kinds; religious, secular, nationalists and [[Labor Zionism|left-wing socialists]]. Socialists aimed to reclaim the land by becoming peasants or workers and forming [[Kibbutz|collectives]]. In Zionist history, the different waves of Jewish settlement are known as "[[aliyah]]". During the [[First Aliyah]], between 1882 and 1903, approximately 35,000 Jews moved to what is now Israel. The first wave coincided with a wave of Jewish migration and [[Messianism]] among [[Yemenite Jews]] and [[Bukharan Jews]]. By 1890, Jews were a majority in [[Jerusalem]], although the country as a whole was populated mainly by Muslim (settled and nomad Bedouins) and Christian Arabs.

In 1896 [[Theodor Herzl]] published ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' (''The Jewish State''), in which he asserted that the solution to growing [[antisemitism]] in Europe (the so-called "[[Jewish Question]]") was to establish a Jewish state. In 1897, the [[Zionist Organisation]] was founded and the [[First Zionist Congress]] proclaimed its aim "to establish a home for the Jewish people in Palestine secured under public law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2004/7/Herzl+and+Zionism.htm |title=Herzl and Zionism |date=20 July 2004 |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Zionism was regarded with suspicion by the Ottoman rulers and was unable to make major progress.

Between 1904 and 1914, around 40,000 Jews settled in the area now known as Israel (the [[Second Aliyah]]). In 1908 the Zionist Organisation set up the Palestine Bureau (also known as the "Eretz Israel Office") in Jaffa and began to adopt a systematic Jewish settlement policy. Migrants were mainly from Russia (which then included part of Poland), escaping persecution. The first [[Kibbutz]], [[Degania Alef|Degania]], was founded by nine Russian socialists in 1909. In 1909 residents of Jaffa established the first entirely Hebrew-speaking city, [[Ahuzat Bayit]] (later renamed [[Tel Aviv]]). Hebrew newspapers and books were published, [[Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium|Hebrew schools]], Jewish political parties and workers organizations were established.

===World War I===
{{Main|Occupied Enemy Territory Administration|Balfour Declaration}}
[[File:OETA Syria.png|thumb|[[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration]], 1918]]
During [[World War I]], most Jews supported the Germans because they were fighting the Russians who were regarded as the Jews' main enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Weizmann, the Making of a Statesman by [[Jehuda Reinharz]], Oxford 1993, chapters 3 &amp; 4&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, the government sought Jewish support for the war effort for a variety of reasons including an erroneous antisemitic perception of "Jewish power" over the Ottoman Empire's [[Young Turks]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;[[David Fromkin]], [[A Peace to End All Peace]], part VI pp. 253–305&lt;/ref&gt; and a desire to secure American Jewish support for US intervention on Britain's behalf.

There was already sympathy for the aims of [[Zionism]] in the British government, including the Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]].&lt;ref&gt;''God, Guns and Israel'', Jill Hamilton, UK 2004, Especially chapter 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1917, the British Army drove the Turks [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign#Palestine campaign|out of Southern Syria]],&lt;ref&gt;''God, Guns and Israel'', Jill Hamilton, UK 2004, Especially chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt; and the British foreign minister, [[Lord Balfour]], sent a public letter to [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]], a leading member of his party and leader of the Jewish community. The letter subsequently became known as the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]]. It stated that the British Government "view[ed] with favour the establishment in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] of a national home for the Jewish people".

The agreement gave Britain control over what parties would begin to call "Palestine".

A [[Jewish Legion]] composed largely of Zionist volunteers organized by [[Jabotinsky]] and [[Trumpeldor]] participated in the British invasion. It also participated in the failed [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. A [[Nili|Zionist spy network]] provided the British with details of Ottoman troops.

==British Mandate of Palestine (1920–1948) ==
{{Main|Mandatory Palestine}}

===First years===
{{See also|Jewish Agency for Israel}}
The [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate]] (in effect, British rule) of Palestine, including the Balfour Declaration, was confirmed by the [[League of Nations]] in 1922 and came into effect in 1923. The boundaries of Palestine initially included modern [[Jordan]], which was [[Emirate of Transjordan|removed]] from the territory by [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] a few years later. Britain signed a treaty with the United States (which did not join the League of Nations) in which the United States endorsed the terms of the Mandate.

Between 1919 and 1923, another 40,000 Jews arrived in Palestine, mainly escaping the post-[[Russian Revolution|revolutionary]] chaos of Russia ([[Third Aliyah]]), as over 100,000 Jews were massacred in this period in Ukraine and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/131078|first=Peter|author2=Pipe, Richard|last= Kenez|last3=Pipes|first3=Richard|title=The Prosecution of Soviet History: A Critique of Richard Pipes' The Russian Revolution |journal=Russian Review|volume=50| issue=3|year=1991|pages=345–51|jstor=131078|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these immigrants became known as "[[wikt:pioneer|pioneers]]" (halutzim), experienced or trained in agriculture and capable of establishing self-sustaining economies. Malarial marshes in the [[Jezreel Valley]] and [[Hefer Plain]] were drained and converted to agricultural use. Land was bought by the [[Jewish National Fund]], a Zionist charity that collected money abroad for that purpose. A mainly socialist underground Jewish militia, [[Haganah]] ("Defense"), was established to defend outlying Jewish settlements.

[[File:Founding of the Hebrew University.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The opening ceremony of The [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] visited by [[Arthur Balfour]], 1 April 1925]]
The French [[Franco-Syrian War|victory]] over the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]] and the Balfour Declaration led to the emergence of [[Palestinian Nationalism]] and Arab rioting in [[1920 Nebi Musa riots|1920]] and [[Jaffa riots|1921]]. In response, the British authorities imposed immigration quotas for Jews. Exceptions were made for Jews with over 1,000 pounds in cash (roughly 100,000 pounds at year 2000 rates) or Jewish professionals with over 500 pounds. The [[Jewish Agency]] issued the British entry permits and distributed funds donated by Jews abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peel Commission]], (Peel report) p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1924 and 1929, 82,000 more Jews arrived ([[Fourth Aliyah]]), fleeing antisemitism in Poland and Hungary, and because the United States [[Immigration Act of 1924]] now kept Jews out. The new arrivals were mainly middle-class families who moved into towns and established small businesses and workshops—although lack of economic opportunities meant that approximately a quarter later left. The first electricity generator was built in Tel Aviv in 1923 under the guidance of [[Pinhas Rutenberg]], a former [[Commissar]] of St Petersburg in Russia's pre-Bolshevik [[Kerensky Government]]. In 1925 the Jewish Agency established the [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem and the [[Technion]] (technological university) in Haifa. British authorities introduced the [[Palestine pound]] (worth 1000 "Mills") in 1927, replacing the [[Egyptian pound]] as the unit of currency in the Mandate.&lt;ref&gt;The Roots of Separatism in Palestine: British Economic Policy, 1920-1929 by BJ Smith 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1928, the democratically elected Va'ad Leumi ([[Jewish National Council]] or JNC) became the main institution of the Palestine Jewish community ("[[Yishuv]]") and included non-Zionist Jews. As the Yishuv grew, the JNC adopted more government-type functions, such as education, health care and security. With British permission, the Va'ad raised its own taxes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amalnet.k12.il/meida/history/hisi1085.htm (in Hebrew accessed 22/4/2009) [[Peel Commission]], (Peel report) pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; and ran independent services for the Jewish population.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peel Commission]], (Peel report) chapters 5, 8 and 16&lt;/ref&gt; From 1929 its leadership was elected by Jews from 26 countries.

In 1929 tensions grew over the Kotel ([[Wailing Wall]]), a narrow alleyway where Jews were banned from using chairs or any furniture (many of the worshipers were elderly). The [[Haj Amin al-Husseini|Mufti]] claimed it was Muslim property and that the Jews were seeking control of the Temple Mount. This (and general animosity) led to the August [[1929 Palestine riots]]. The [[1929 Hebron massacre|main victims]] were the ancient Jewish community at Hebron, which came to an end. The riots led to right-wing Zionists establishing their own militia in 1931, the [[Irgun]] Tzvai Leumi (National Military Organization, known in Hebrew by its acronym "Etzel").

Zionist political parties provided private education and health care: the [[General Zionists]], the [[Mizrachi (political party)|Mizrahi]] and the [[Labor Zionism|Socialist Zionists]], each established independent health and education services and operated sports organizations funded by local taxes, donations and fees (the British administration did not invest in public services). During the whole interwar period, the British, appealing to the terms of the Mandate, rejected the principle of majority rule or any other measure that would give the Arab population, who formed the majority of the population, control over Palestinian territory.

===Increase of Jewish immigration===
{{Main|Fifth Aliyah|Nuremberg Laws|Tripartite_Pact}}
In 1933, the Jewish Agency and the Nazis negotiated the [[Ha'avara Agreement]] (transfer agreement), under which 50,000 Jews would be transferred to Palestine. The Jews' possessions were confiscated and in return the Nazis allowed the Ha'avara organization to purchase 14 million pounds worth of German goods for export to Palestine and use it to compensate the immigrants. Although many Jews wanted to leave Nazi Germany, the Nazis prevented Jews from taking any money and restricted them to two suitcases so few could pay the British entry tax and many were afraid to leave. The agreement was controversial and the Labour Zionist leader who negotiated the agreement, [[Haim Arlosoroff]], was assassinated in Tel Aviv in 1933. The assassination was used by the British to create tension between the Zionist left and the Zionist right. Arlosoroff had been the boyfriend of [[Magda Goebbels|Magda Ritschel]] some years before she married [[Joseph Goebbels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/reich-mother-loved-to-death/171407.article|title=Reich mother loved to death|work=[[Times Higher Education]]|date=6 September 2002|accessdate=5 June 2016|last=Pine|first= Lisa |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been speculation that he was assassinated by the Nazis to hide the connection but there is no evidence for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Qui a tué Arlozoroff ?|first=Tobie|last=Nathan|date=12 May 2010|publisher=Grasset}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Palestine, Jewish immigration (and the Ha'avara goods) helped the economy to flourish. The British used the taxes paid by the Jewish population to build a port and oil refineries at Haifa and to fund their government in Transjordan. Industrialization began to change the predominantly agricultural Palestinian economy.

Between 1929 and 1938, 250,000 Jews arrived in Palestine ([[Fifth Aliyah]]). 174,000 arrived between 1933 and 1936, after which the British increasingly prevented immigration. Migrants were mainly from Germany and included professionals, doctors, lawyers and professors. German architects of the [[Bauhaus]] school made Tel-Aviv the world's only city with purely [[White City (Tel Aviv)|Bauhaus neighbourhoods]] and Palestine had the highest per-capita percentage of doctors in the world.

Fascist regimes were emerging across Europe and persecution of Jews increased. In many countries, Jews reverted to being non-citizens deprived of civil and economic rights, subject to arbitrary persecution. Significantly antisemitic governments came to power in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (the government increasingly boycotted Jews and by 1937 had totally excluded all Jews),&lt;ref&gt;Social and Political History of the Jews in Poland, 1919–1939 By Joseph Marcus, Mouton 1983, pg 366&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hungary during World War II|Hungary]], [[Romania in World War II|Romania]] and the Nazi created states of [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]] and [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovakia]], while [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] annexed [[Anschluss|Austria]] and the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Czech territories]].

===Arab revolt and the White Paper===
{{Main|1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|White Paper of 1939}}
[[File:Ghaffis in Nesher 2.jpg|thumb|[[Jewish Settlement Police]] members watching the settlement [[Nesher]] during [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936–1939 Arab revolt]]]]
Jewish immigration and Nazi propaganda contributed to the large-scale [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine]], a largely nationalist uprising directed at ending British rule. The head of the Jewish Agency, Ben-Gurion, responded to the Arab Revolt with a policy of "[[Havlagah]]"—self-restraint and a refusal to be provoked by Arab attacks in order to prevent polarization. The Etzel group broke off from the Haganah in opposition to this policy.

The British responded to the revolt with the [[Peel Commission]] (1936–37), a public inquiry that recommended that an exclusively Jewish territory be created in the [[Galilee]] and western coast (including the [[population transfer]] of 225,000 Arabs); the rest becoming an exclusively Arab area. The two main Jewish leaders, [[Chaim Weizmann]] and [[David Ben-Gurion]], had convinced the [[World Zionist Congress|Zionist Congress]] to approve equivocally the Peel recommendations as a basis for more negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William Roger Louis|title=Ends of British Imperialism: The Scramble for Empire, Suez, and Decolonization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQnpQNKeKKAC|year=2006|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-347-6|page=391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris, One state, two states:resolving the Israel/Palestine conflict, 2009, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uM_kFX6edX8C The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited], p. 48; p. 11 "while the Zionist movement, after much agonising, accepted the principle of partition and the proposals as a basis for negotiation"; p. 49 "In the end, after bitter debate, the Congress equivocally approved –by a vote of 299 to 160 – the Peel recommendations as a basis for further negotiation."&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was rejected outright by the Palestinian Arab leadership and they renewed the revolt, which caused the British to appease the Arabs, and to abandon the plan as unworkable.&lt;ref&gt;For more information see ''Palestine: Retreat from the Mandate, The making of British Policy, 1936–1945'' by Michael Cohen, New York 1979 Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uM_kFX6edX8C The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited], p. 11, "The AHC renewed the revolt. Whitehall ... took vigorous steps to appease the Palestinians."&lt;/ref&gt;

Testifying before the Peel Commission, Weizmann said "There are in Europe 6,000,000 people ... for whom the world is divided into places where they cannot live and places where they cannot enter." In 1938, the US called an [[Évian Conference|international conference]] to address the question of the vast numbers of Jews trying to escape Europe. Britain made its attendance contingent on Palestine being kept out of the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Conor Cruise O'Brien|title=The Siege|date=2015|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber Limited|isbn=9780571324545|page=233|quote=The outside world, while shocked by Nazi atrocities, did little to help the victims. A conference of thiry-one countries, which met at Evian in early July did no more than confirm the validity of Weizmann's diagnosis, before the Peel Commission, of the condition of the European Jews in the late thirties: ... the world is divided into places where they cannot live and places into which they cannot enter." Palestine was excluded from the Evian agenda at the insistence of the British Government.}}&lt;/ref&gt; No Jewish representatives were invited. The Nazis proposed their own solution: that the Jews of Europe be shipped to Madagascar (the [[Madagascar Plan]]).

With millions of Jews trying to leave Europe and every country in the world closed to Jewish migration, the British decided to close Palestine. The [[White Paper of 1939]], recommended that an independent Palestine, governed jointly by Arabs and Jews, be established within 10 years. The White Paper agreed to allow 75,000 Jewish immigrants into Palestine over the period 1940–44, after which migration would require Arab approval. Both the Arab and Jewish leadership rejected the White Paper. In March 1940 the British High Commissioner for Palestine issued an edict banning Jews from purchasing land in 95% of Palestine. Jews now resorted to illegal immigration: ([[Aliyah Bet]] or "Ha'apalah"), often organized by the [[Mossad Le'aliyah Bet]] and the Irgun. Very few Jews managed to escape Europe between 1939 and 1945. Those caught by the British were mostly [[History of the Jews in Mauritius|sent to Mauritius]].

===World War II and the Holocaust===

During the [[Second World War]], the Jewish Agency worked to establish a Jewish army that would fight alongside the British forces. Churchill supported the plan but British Military and government opposition led to its rejection. The British demanded that the number of Jewish recruits match the number of Arab recruits,&lt;ref&gt;''Palestine: Retreat from the Mandate, The making of British Policy, 1936–1945'' by Michael Cohen, New York 1979 p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; but few Arabs would fight for Britain, and the Palestinian leader, the [[Haj Amin al-Husseini|Mufti of Jerusalem]], allied with Nazi Germany.

In May 1941, the [[Palmach]] was established to defend the [[Yishuv]] against the planned [[Axis powers|Axis]] invasion through [[North African Campaign|North Africa]]. The British refusal to provide arms to the Jews, even when Rommel's forces were [[200 days of dread|advancing through Egypt]] in June 1942 (intent on occupying Palestine) and the 1939 White Paper, led to the emergence of a Zionist leadership in Palestine that believed conflict with Britain was inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;''Palestine: Retreat from the Mandate, The making of British Policy, 1936–1945'' by Michael Cohen, New York 1979 pp. 122–130&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the Jewish Agency called on Palestine's Jewish youth to volunteer for the British Army (both men and women). 30,000 Palestinian Jews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Niewyk |first=Donald L. |title=The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QQ7AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA247|publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2000 |page=247 |isbn=0231112009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 6,000 Palestinian Arabs enlisted in the British armed forces during the war. In June 1944 the British agreed to create a [[Jewish Brigade]] that would fight in Italy.

Approximately 1.5 million Jews around the world served in every branch of the allied armies, mainly in the Soviet and US armies. 200,000 Jews died serving in the Soviet army alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yadvashem.org/holocaust/about/combat-resistance/jewish-soldiers "Jewish Soldiers in the Allied Armies"]. [[Yad Vashem]].&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these war veterans later volunteered to fight for Israel or were active in its support.

A small group (about 200 activists), dedicated to resisting the British administration in Palestine, broke away from the Etzel (which advocated support for Britain during the war) and formed the "Lehi" ([[Stern Gang]]), led by [[Avraham Stern]]. In 1943, the [[USSR]] released the Revisionist Zionist leader [[Menachem Begin]] from the [[Gulag]] and he went to Palestine, taking command of the Etzel organization with a policy of increased conflict against the British. At about the same time [[Yitzhak Shamir]] escaped from the [[Irgun and Lehi internment in Africa|camp in Eritrea]] where the British were holding Lehi activists without trial, taking command of the Lehi (Stern Gang).

Jews in the Middle East were also affected by the war. Most of North Africa came under Nazi control and many Jews were used as slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007312|title=Jews in North Africa: Oppression and Resistance|website=www.ushmm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1941 [[1941 Iraqi coup d'état|pro-Axis coup in Iraq]] was accompanied by [[Farhud|massacres]] of Jews. The Jewish Agency put together plans for a last stand in the event of Rommel invading Palestine (the Nazis planned to exterminate Palestine's Jews).&lt;ref&gt;''Nazi Palestine: The Plans for the Extermination of the Jews in Palestine'' by Mallman and Cuppers, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1939 and 1945, the Nazis, [[Responsibility for the Holocaust|aided by local forces]], led systematic efforts to kill every person of Jewish extraction in Europe (The [[Holocaust]]), causing the deaths of approximately 6 million Jews. A quarter of those killed were children. The Polish and German Jewish communities, which played an important role in defining the pre-1945 Jewish world, mostly ceased to exist. In the United States and Palestine, Jews of European origin became disconnected from their families and roots. [[Sephardi Jews|Sepharadi]] and [[Mizrahi Jews]], who had been a minority, became a much more significant factor in the Jewish world. Those Jews who survived in central Europe, were [[Displaced persons camp|displaced persons]] (refugees); an [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]], established to examine the Palestine issue, surveyed their ambitions and found that over 95% wanted to migrate to Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1946/02/03/2743526/unrra-polls-displaced-jews-on-emigration-plans-first-vote-shows-palestine-is-favored |title=Unrra Polls Displaced Jews on Emigration Plans; First Vote Shows Palestine is Favored |publisher=JTA |date=1946-02-03 |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/educational_materials/shapira_survivors.asp |title=Survivors of the Holocaust - Educational Materials - Education &amp; E-Learning |publisher=Yad Vashem |date= |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Between National Socialism and Soviet Communism: Displaced Persons in Postwar Germany by Anna Holian Michigan 2011 pp 181–2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Zionist movement the moderate Pro-British (and British citizen) Weizmann, whose son died flying in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], was undermined by Britain's anti-Zionist policies.&lt;ref&gt;''Palestine: Retreat from the Mandate, The making of British Policy, 1936–1945'' by Michael Cohen, New York 1979 pp. 125–135&lt;/ref&gt; Leadership of the movement passed to the Jewish Agency in Palestine, now led by the anti-British Socialist-Zionist party ([[Mapai]]) and led by [[David Ben-Gurion]]. In the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], US Jews now dominated the Zionist movement.

===Illegal Jewish immigration and insurgency===
{{Main|Bricha|Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine}}
{{See also|Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–46}}
The [[British Empire]] was severely weakened by the war. In the Middle East, the war had made Britain conscious of its dependence on Arab oil. British firms controlled Iraqi oil and Britain ruled Kuwait, Bahrain and the Emirates. Shortly after [[VE Day]], the Labour Party won the general election in Britain. Although Labour Party conferences had for years called for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, the Labour government now decided to maintain the 1939 White Paper policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sofer |first=Sasson |title=Zionism and the Foundations of Israeli Diplomacy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |page=41 |isbn=9780521038270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:19450715 Buchenwald survivors arrive in Haifa.jpg|thumb|[[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] survivors arrive in [[Haifa]] to be arrested by the British, 15 July 1945]]
Illegal migration ([[Aliyah Bet]]) became the main form of Jewish entry into Palestine. Across Europe [[Bricha]] ("flight"), an organization of former [[Jewish partisans|partisans]] and [[Jewish resistance under Nazi rule|ghetto fighters]], smuggled Holocaust survivors from Eastern Europe to Mediterranean ports, where small boats tried to breach the British blockade of Palestine. Meanwhile, Jews from Arab countries began moving into Palestine overland. Despite British efforts to curb immigration, during the 14 years of the Aliyah Bet, over 110,000 Jews entered Palestine. By the end of World War II, the Jewish population of Palestine had increased to 33% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mideastweb.org/palpop.htm |title=The Population of Palestine Prior to 1948 |publisher=MidEastWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to win independence, Zionists now waged a [[British–Zionist conflict|guerrilla war]] against the British. The main underground Jewish militia, the Haganah, formed an alliance called the [[Jewish Resistance Movement]] with the Etzel and Stern Gang to fight the British. In June 1946, following instances of Jewish [[Night of the Bridges|sabotage]], the British launched [[Operation Agatha]], arresting 2700 Jews, including the leadership of the Jewish Agency, whose headquarters were raided. Those arrested were held without trial.

On July 4 1946 [[Kielce Pogrom|a massive pogrom in Poland]] led to a wave of Holocaust survivors fleeing Europe for Palestine. Three weeks later (21 July), Etzel [[King David Hotel bombing|bombed the British Military Headquarters]] in the King David Hotel (Jerusalem) killing 91 people. In the days following the bombing, Tel Aviv was placed under curfew and over 120,000 Jews, nearly 20% of the Jewish population of Palestine, were questioned by the police. In the US, Congress criticized British handling of the situation and considered delaying [[Anglo-American loan|loans]] that were vital to British post-war recovery&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jpost.com/Features/A-debt-the-British-paid-and-one-they-didnt&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Between 1945 and 1948, 100,000–120,000 Jews left Poland. Their departure was largely organized by Zionist activists in Poland under the umbrella of the semi-clandestine organization ''[[Berihah]]'' ("Flight").&lt;ref name="YV-archive3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collections1.yadvashem.org/notebook_ext.asp?item=51009 |title=Cracow, Poland, Postwar, Yosef Hillpshtein and his friends of the Bericha movement |publisher=Yad Vashem |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Berihah'' was also responsible for the organized emigration of Jews from [[History of the Jews in Romania#Post-War|Romania]], Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, totalling 250,000 (including Poland) Holocaust survivors. The British imprisoned the Jews trying to enter Palestine in the [[Atlit detainee camp]] and [[Cyprus internment camps]]. Those held were mainly Holocaust survivors, including large numbers of children and orphans. In response to Cypriot fears that the Jews would never leave (since they lacked a state or documentation) and because the 75,000 quota established by the 1939 White Paper had never been filled, the British allowed the refugees to enter Palestine at a rate of 750 per month.

By 1947 the Labour Government was ready to refer the Palestine problem to the newly created United Nations.

During the visit the British Foreign Secretary [[Ernest Bevin]] ordered an illegal immigrant ship, the ''[[Exodus 1947]]'', to be sent back to Europe. The migrants on the ship were forcibly removed by British troops at Hamburg.

The principal non-Zionist Orthodox Jewish (or [[Haredi]]) party, [[Agudat Israel]], recommended to UNSCOP that a Jewish state be set up after reaching a religious [[Status quo (Israel)|status quo agreement]] with Ben-Gurion regarding the future Jewish state. The agreement granted an exemption from military service to a quota of [[yeshiva]] (religious seminary) students and to all orthodox women, made the Sabbath the national weekend, guaranteed [[Kosher]] food in government institutions and allowed Orthodox Jews to maintain a separate education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news1.co.il/uploadFiles/781353175640107.doc |script-title=he:מכתב הסטטוס קוו |date=19 June 1947 |language=Hebrew |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither Britain nor the UN Security Council took any action to implement the resolution and Britain continued detaining Jews attempting to enter Palestine. Concerned that partition would severely damage Anglo-Arab relations, Britain denied UN representatives access to Palestine during the period between the adoption of Resolution 181 (II) and the termination of the British Mandate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Trygve Lie]], In the Cause of Peace, Seven Years with the United Nations (New York: MacMillan 1954) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; The British withdrawal was finally completed in May 1948.

===Civil War===
{{Main|1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine}}
[[File:Jerusalem convoy.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Supply convoy on its way to [[Battle for Jerusalem (1948)|besieged]] [[Jerusalem]], April 1948]]
The General Assembly's vote caused joy in the Jewish community and discontent among the Arab community. Violence broke out between the sides, escalating into [[1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine|civil war]]. From January 1948, operations became increasingly militarized, with the intervention of a number of [[Arab Liberation Army]] regiments inside Palestine, each active in a variety of distinct sectors around the different coastal towns. They consolidated their presence in [[Galilee]] and [[Samaria]].&lt;ref name="Yoav Gelber 2006 pp.51-56"&gt;[[#gelber|Yoav Gelber (2006)]], pp. 51–56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni]] came from Egypt with several hundred men of the [[Army of the Holy War]]. Having recruited a few thousand volunteers, he organized the blockade of the 100,000 Jewish residents of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Larry Collins 1971 p.7"&gt;[[#lapierre collins|Dominique Lapierre et Larry Collins (1971)]], chap. 7, pp. 131–153&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yishuv]] tried to supply the city using convoys of up to 100 armoured vehicles, but largely failed. By March, almost all [[Haganah]]'s armoured vehicles had been destroyed, the blockade was in full operation, and hundreds of Haganah members who had tried to bring supplies into the city were killed.&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.163"&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to 100,000 Arabs, from the urban upper and middle classes in Haifa, Jaffa and Jerusalem, or Jewish-dominated areas, evacuated abroad or to Arab centres eastwards.&lt;ref name="Benny Morris 2003 p.67"&gt;[[#morris birth|Benny Morris (2003)]], p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; This situation caused the US to withdraw their support for the Partition plan, thus encouraging the [[Arab League]] to believe that the Palestinian Arabs, reinforced by the Arab Liberation Army, could put an end to the plan for partition. The British, on the other hand, decided on 7 February 1948 to support the annexation of the Arab part of Palestine by [[Jordan|Transjordan]].&lt;ref name="Henry Laurens 2005 p.83"&gt;[[#laurens|Henry Laurens (2005)]], p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Declaration of State of Israel 1948.jpg|thumb|[[David Ben-Gurion]] proclaiming the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] in 1948]]
[[David Ben-Gurion]] reorganized Haganah and made conscription obligatory. Every Jewish man and woman in the country had to receive military training. Thanks to funds raised by [[Golda Meir]] from sympathisers in the United States, and Stalin's decision to support the [[Zionism|Zionist]] cause, the Jewish representatives of Palestine were able to purchase important arms in Eastern Europe.

Ben-Gurion gave [[Yigael Yadin]] the responsibility to plan for the announced intervention of the Arab states. The result of his analysis was [[Plan Dalet]], in which Haganah passed from the defensive to the offensive. The plan sought to establish Jewish territorial continuity by conquering mixed zones. [[Tiberias]], [[Haifa]], [[Safed]], [[Beisan]], [[Jaffa]] and Acre fell, resulting in the flight of more than 250,000 Palestinian Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#laurens|Henry Laurens (2005)]], pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; The situation pushed the leaders of the neighbouring Arab states to intervene.

On 14 May 1948, on the day the last British forces left from Haifa, the [[Jewish People's Council]] gathered at the [[Tel Aviv Museum]] and proclaimed [[Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel|the establishment]] of a [[Jewish state]] in [[Eretz Israel]], to be known as the [[State of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/Declaration+of+Establishment+of+State+of+Israel.htm Declaration of Establishment of State of Israel: 14 May 1948: Retrieved 2 June 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321213130/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/Declaration%20of%20Establishment%20of%20State%20of%20Israel.htm |date=21 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State of Israel (1948–present)==

===War of Independence===
{{Main|1948 Arab–Israeli War}}
[[File:Raising the Ink Flag at Umm Rashrash (Eilat).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Avraham Adan]] raising the [[Ink Flag]] marking the end of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]]]
Immediately following the declaration of the new state, both [[superpower]] leaders, US President [[Harry S. Truman]] and Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], recognized the new state.
The [[Arab League]] members Egypt, Transjordan, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq refused to accept the UN partition plan and proclaimed the right of self-determination for the Arabs across the whole of Palestine. The Arab states marched their forces into what had, until the previous day, been the British Mandate for Palestine, starting the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|first Arab–Israeli War]]. The Arab states had heavy military equipment at their disposal and were initially on the offensive (the Jewish forces were not a state before 15 May and could not buy heavy arms). On 29 May 1948, the British initiated [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 50]] declaring an arms embargo on the region. [[Czechoslovakia]] [[Arms shipments from Czechoslovakia to Israel 1947–1949|violated the resolution]], supplying the Jewish state with critical military hardware to match the (mainly British) heavy equipment and planes already owned by the invading Arab states. On 11 June, a month-long UN truce was put into effect.

Following independence, the [[Haganah]] became the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF). The [[Palmach]], [[Irgun|Etzel]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] were required to cease independent operations and join the IDF. During the ceasefire, Etzel attempted to bring in a private arms shipment aboard a ship called "[[Altalena]]". When they refused to hand the arms to the government, Ben-Gurion ordered that the ship be sunk. Several Etzel members were killed in the fighting.

Large numbers of Jewish immigrants, many of them World War II veterans and Holocaust survivors, now began arriving in the new state of Israel, and many joined the IDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hagana.co.il/show_item.asp?levelId=59798&amp;itemId=47310&amp;itemType=3 |publisher=hagana.co.il |script-title=he:גיוס חוץ לארץ |accessdate=2007-12-11 |language=Hebrew |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231104437/http://www.hagana.co.il/show_item.asp?levelId=59798&amp;itemId=47310&amp;itemType=3 |archivedate=31 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an initial loss of territory by the Jewish state and its occupation by the Arab armies, from July the tide gradually turned in the Israelis' favour and they pushed the Arab armies out and conquered some of the territory that had been included in the proposed Arab state. At the end of November, tenuous local ceasefires were arranged between the Israelis, Syrians and Lebanese. On 1 December [[Abdullah I of Jordan|King Abdullah]] announced the union of Transjordan with Arab Palestine west of the Jordan; only Britain recognized the annexation.

===Armistice Agreements===
{{Main|1949 Armistice Agreements}}
[[File:Cia-is-map2.png|thumb|upright|[[Green Line (Israel)|1949 Green Line]]]]
Israel signed [[1949 Armistice Agreements|armistices]] with Egypt (24 February), Lebanon (23 March), Jordan (3 April) and Syria (20 July). No actual peace agreements were signed. With [[1949 Armistice Agreements|permanent ceasefire]] coming into effect, Israel's new borders, later known as the [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]], were established. These borders were not recognized by the Arab states as international boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Green Line: the name given to the 1949 Armistice lines that constituted the de facto borders of pre-1967 Israel — [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/israel/il_glos.html "Glossary: Israel"], ''[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF had overrun [[Galilee]], [[Jezreel Valley]], [[West Jerusalem]], the [[Israeli coastal plain|coastal plain]] and the [[Negev]]. The Syrians remained in control of a strip of territory along the Sea of Galilee originally allocated to the Jewish state, the Lebanese occupied a tiny area at [[Rosh HaNikra, Israel|Rosh Hanikra]], and the Egyptians retained the Gaza strip and still had some forces surrounded inside Israeli territory. Jordanian forces remained in [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|the West Bank]], where the British had stationed them before the war. Jordan annexed the areas it occupied while Egypt kept [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|Gaza as an occupied zone]].

Following the ceasefire declaration, Britain released over 2,000 Jewish detainees it was still holding in Cyprus and recognized the state of Israel. On 11 May 1949, Israel was admitted as a member of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/gov_un_mem_dat-government-un-membership-date|title=Countries Compared by Government &gt; UN membership date. International Statistics at NationMaster.com|website=www.nationmaster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of an Israeli population of 650,000, some 6,000 men and women were killed in the fighting, including 4,000 soldiers in the IDF. According to United Nations figures, 726,000 Palestinians [[1948 Palestinian exodus|had fled or were evicted]] by the Israelis between 1947 and 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|2004|pp=604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except in Jordan, the Palestinian refugees were settled in large refugee camps in poor, overcrowded conditions and denied citizenship by their host countries. In December 1949, the UN (in response to a British proposal) established an agency ([[UNRWA]]) to provide aid to the Palestinian refugees. It became the largest single UN agency and is the only UN agency that serves a single people.

A 120-seat parliament, the [[Knesset]], met first in [[Tel Aviv]] then moved to [[Jerusalem]] after the 1949 ceasefire. In January 1949, Israel held its [[Israeli legislative election, 1949|first elections]]. The Socialist-Zionist parties [[Mapai]] and [[Mapam]] won the most seats (46 and 19 respectively). Mapai's leader, [[David Ben-Gurion]], was appointed [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]], he formed a coalition which did not include Mapam who were [[Stalinist]] and loyal to the USSR (another Stalinist party, non-Zionist [[Maki (historical political party)|Maki]] won 4 seats). The Knesset elected [[Chaim Weizmann]] as the first (largely ceremonial) [[President of Israel]]. [[Hebrew]] and [[Arabic]] were made the official languages of the new state. All governments have been [[coalitions]]—no party has ever won a majority in the Knesset. From 1948 until 1977 all governments were led by [[Mapai]] and the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]], predecessors of the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labour Party]]. In those years [[Labor Zionism|Labour Zionists]], initially led by [[David Ben-Gurion]], dominated Israeli politics and the economy was run on primarily [[Socialism|socialist lines]].

Within three years (1948 to 1951), immigration doubled the Jewish population of Israel and left an indelible imprint on Israeli society.&lt;ref&gt;''Immigrants in Turmoil: Mass Immigration to Israel and its Repercussions in the 1950s and After'' Dvora Hacohen, Syracuse University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www1.cbs.gov.il/reader/shnaton/templ_shnaton_e.html?num_tab=st02_01&amp;CYear=2006 |publisher=Israel Central Bureau of Statistics |accessdate=7 August 2007 |year=2006 |title=Population, by Religion and Population Group |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033403/http://www1.cbs.gov.il/reader/shnaton/templ_shnaton_e.html?num_tab=st02_01&amp;CYear=2006 |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, 700,000 Jews settled in Israel during this period.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris, ''Righteous Victims'', chap.VI.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 300,000 arrived from Asian and North African nations as part of the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]].&lt;ref name=sachar_pp395-403&gt;Sachar, pp. 395–403.&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, the largest group (over 100,000) was from Iraq. The rest of the immigrants were from Europe, including more than 270,000 who came from Eastern Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Tom Segev, ''1949. The First Israelis'', Owl Books, 1986, p.96.&lt;/ref&gt; mainly Romania and Poland (over 100,000 each). Nearly all the Jewish immigrants could be described as [[refugee]]s, however only 136,000 who immigrated to Israel from Central Europe, had international certification because they belonged to the 250,000 Jews registered by the allies as displaced after World War II and living in [[Displaced persons camps in post-World War II Europe|displaced persons camp]]s in Germany, Austria and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005462 |title=Displaced Persons |work=Holocaust Encyclopedia |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 the Knesset passed the [[Law of Return]], which granted to all Jews and those of Jewish ancestry, and their spouses, the right to settle in Israel and gain citizenship. That year, 50,000 Yemenite Jews (99%) were [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|secretly flown]] to Israel. In 1951 Iraqi Jews were granted temporary permission to leave the country and 120,000 (over 90%) opted [[Operation Ezra and Nehemiah|to move to Israel]]. Jews also fled from Lebanon, Syria and Egypt. By the late sixties, about 500,000 Jews had left Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. Over the course of twenty years, some 850,000 Jews from Arab countries (99%) relocated to Israel (680,000), France and the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il VI- The Arab Refugees – Introduction]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mr4x36zY?url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/ |date=17 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Group seeks justice for 'forgotten' Jews |first=Warren |last=Hoge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/world/americas/04iht-nations.4.8182206.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 November 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land and property left behind by the Jews (much of it in Arab city centres) is still a matter of some dispute. Today there are about 9,000 Jews living in Arab states, of whom 75% live in Morocco and 15% in Tunisia.

Between 1948 and 1958, the population of Israel rose from 800,000 to two million. During this period, food, clothes and furniture had to be rationed in what became known as the [[Austerity in Israel|Austerity Period]] (''Tkufat haTsena''). Immigrants were mostly refugees with no money or possessions and many were housed in temporary camps known as [[ma'abarot]]. By 1952, over 200,000 immigrants were living in tents or prefabricated shacks built by the government. Israel received financial aid from private donations from [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee|outside the country]] (mainly the United States).&lt;ref&gt;''Mishtar HaTsena'' (in Hebrew), Dr Avigail Cohen &amp; Haya Oren, Tel Aviv 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure on the new state's finances led Ben-Gurion to sign a [[Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany|reparations agreement]] with [[West Germany]]. During the Knesset debate some 5,000 demonstrators gathered and riot police had to cordon the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/1,7340,L-3306796,00.html |script-title=he:היום שבו נכבשה הכנסת (כמעט) |language=Hebrew |publisher=[[Ynet]] |accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel received several billion marks and in return agreed to open diplomatic relations with Germany.

At the end of 1953, Ben-Gurion retired to [[Kibbutz]] [[Sde Boker]] in the [[Negev]].

In 1949, education was made free and compulsory for all citizens until the age of 14. The state now funded the party-affiliated Zionist education system and a new body created by the Haredi [[Agudat Israel]] party. A separate body was created to provide education for the remaining Palestinian-Arab population. The major political parties now competed for immigrants to join their education systems. The government banned the existing educational bodies from the transit camps and tried to mandate a unitary secular socialist education&lt;ref&gt;The melting pot in Israel: the commission of inquiry concerning education in the early years of the state by Tzvi Tzameret, Albany 2002 chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; under the control of "camp managers" who also had to provide work, food and housing for the immigrants. There were attempts to force orthodox Yemenite children to adopt a secular life style by teachers, including many instances of Yemenite children having their [[Payot|side-curls]] cut by teachers. This led to the first Israeli public inquiry (the Fromkin Inquiry),&lt;ref&gt;For more information see ''The melting pot in Israel'' by Tzvi Tzameret, Albany 2002&lt;/ref&gt; the collapse of the coalition, and an [[Israeli legislative election, 1951|election]] in 1951, with little change in the results. In 1953 the party-affiliated education system was scrapped and replaced by a secular state education system and a state-run Modern Orthodox system. Agudat Israel were allowed to maintain their existing school system.

In its early years Israel sought to maintain a non-aligned position between the super-powers. However, in 1952, an antisemitic public trial was staged in Moscow in which a group of Jewish doctors were accused of trying to poison Stalin (the [[Doctors' plot]]), followed by a similar trial in Czechoslovakia ([[Slánský trial]]). This, and the failure of Israel to be included in the [[Bandung Conference]] (of [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned states]]), effectively ended Israel's pursuit of non-alignment. On 19 May 1950, Egypt announced that the [[Suez Canal]] was closed to Israeli ships and commerce. In 1952 a [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|military coup]] in Egypt brought [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Abdel Nasser]] to power. The United States pursued close relations with the new Arab states, particularly the Nasser-led Egyptian [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers Movement]] and [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia]]. Israel's solution to diplomatic isolation was to establish good relations with newly independent states in [[Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;"Israel's Military Aid to Africa, 1960–66", Abel Jacob in ''The Journal of Modern African Studies'', vol. 9, no. 2 (August 1971), pp. 165–187&lt;/ref&gt; and with France, which was engaged in the [[Algerian War]].

In the [[Israeli legislative election, 1955|January 1955 elections]] Mapai won 40 seats and the Labour Party 10, [[Moshe Sharett]] became prime minister of Israel at the head of a left-wing coalition. Between 1953 and 1956, there were intermittent clashes along all of Israel's borders as Arab [[List of attacks against Israeli civilians before 1967|terrorism]] and breaches of the ceasefire resulted in Israeli [[Retribution operations|counter-raids]]. [[Palestinian fedayeen]] attacks, often organized and sponsored by the Egyptians, were made from [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|(Egyptian occupied) Gaza]]. Fedayeen attacks led to a growing cycle of violence as Israel launched [[Unit 101|reprisal attacks]] against Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer C. Tucker, Priscilla Mary Roberts (eds.).

[[ABC-CLIO]]. p. 229. {{ISBN|978-1-85109-842-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 the [[Uzi]] submachine gun first entered use by the Israel Defense Forces.

Archaeologist and General [[Yigael Yadin]] purchased the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] on behalf of the State of Israel. The entire first batch to be discovered were now owned by Israel and housed in the [[Shrine of the Book]] at the [[Israel Museum]].

Sharett's government was brought down by the [[Lavon Affair]], a crude plan to disrupt US–Egyptian relations, involving Israeli agents planting bombs at American sites in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/lavon_eng.htm |title=Lavon Affair |work=Lexicon of Terms |publisher=Knesset |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan failed when eleven agents were arrested. Defense Minister [[Pinhas Lavon|Lavon]] was blamed despite his denial of responsibility. The Lavon affair led to Sharett's resignation and Ben-Gurion returned to the post of prime minister.

In 1956, the increasingly pro-Soviet President Nasser of Egypt, announced the nationalization of the (French and British owned) [[Suez Canal]], which was Egypt's main source of foreign currency. Egypt also blockaded the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] preventing Israeli access to the [[Red Sea]]. Israel made a [[Protocol of Sèvres|secret agreement]] with the French at Sèvres to co-ordinate military operations against Egypt. Britain and France had already begun secret preparations for military action. It has been alleged that the French also agreed to build a [[Negev Nuclear Research Center|nuclear plant]] for the Israelis and that by 1968 this was able to produce [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|nuclear weapons]]. Britain and France arranged for Israel to give them a pretext for seizing the Suez Canal. Israel was to attack Egypt, and Britain and France would then call on both sides to withdraw. When, as expected, the Egyptians refused, Anglo-French forces would invade to take control of the Canal.

[[File:Israeli troops in sinai war.jpg|thumb|Israeli paratroopers dig in near the [[Mitla Pass]], 31 October 1956]]
Israeli forces, commanded by General [[Moshe Dayan]], [[Operation Kadesh|attacked]] Egypt on 29 October 1956. On 30 October Britain and France made their pre-arranged call for both sides to stop fighting and withdraw from the Canal area, and for them to be allowed to take up positions at key points on the Canal. Egypt refused and the allies commenced air strikes on 31 October aimed at neutralizing the Egyptian air force. By 5 November the Israelis had overrun the [[Sinai]]. The Anglo-French invasion began that day. There was uproar in the UN, with the United States and USSR for once in agreement in denouncing the actions of Israel, Britain and France. A demand for a ceasefire was reluctantly accepted on 7 November.

At Egypt's request, the UN sent an [[United Nations Emergency Force|Emergency Force]] (UNEF), consisting of 6,000 peacekeeping troops from 10 nations to supervise the ceasefire. This was the first ever UN peacekeeping operation. From 15 November the UN troops marked out a zone across the Sinai to separate the Israeli and Egyptian forces. Upon receiving US guarantees of Israeli access to the Suez Canal, freedom of access out of the Gulf of Aqaba and Egyptian action to stop Palestinian raids from Gaza, the Israelis withdrew to the Negev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/past/unef1backgr2.html#three |title=First United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF I) - Background |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice the Suez Canal remained closed to Israeli shipping. The conflict marked the end of West-European dominance in the Middle East.

Nasser emerged as the victor in the conflict, having won the political battle, however the Israeli military learnt that it did not need British or French support in order to conquer Sinai and that it could conquer the Sinai peninsula in a few days. The Israeli political leadership learnt that Israel had a limited time frame within which to operate militarily after which international political pressure would restrict Israel's freedom of action.

In 1956, two [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|modern-orthodox]] (and [[Religious Zionism|religious-zionist]]) parties, [[Mizrachi (political party)|Mizrachi]] and [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]], joined to form the [[National Religious Party]]. The party was a component of every Israeli coalition until 1992, usually running the Ministry of Education. Mapai was once again victorious in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1959|1959 elections]], increasing its number of seats to 47, Labour had 7. Ben-Gurion remained Prime Minister.

In 1959, there were renewed skirmishes along Israel's borders that continued throughout the early 1960s. The Arab League continued to maintain an [[Arab League boycott of Israel|economic boycott]] and there was a dispute over water rights in the River Jordan basin. With Soviet backing, the Arab states, particularly Egypt, were continuing to build up their forces. Israel's main military [[France–Israel relations|hardware supplier was France]].

[[File:1961-04-13 Tale Of Century - Eichmann Tried For War Crimes.ogv|thumb|US newsreel on the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]]]]
[[Rudolph Kastner]], a minor political functionary, was accused of collaborating with the Nazis and sued his accuser. Kastner lost the trial and was assassinated two years later. In 1958 the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] exonerated him. In May 1960 [[Adolf Eichmann]], one of the chief administrators of the Nazi Holocaust, was located in Argentina by the [[Mossad]], which later kidnapped him to Israel. In 1961 he was put on trial, and after several months found guilty and sentenced to death. He was hanged in 1962 and is the only person ever sentenced to death by an Israeli court. Testimonies by Holocaust survivors at the trial and the extensive publicity that surrounded it has led the trial to be considered a turning point in public awareness of the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;"The Eichmann Trial and American Jewry: A Reassessment", Françoise S. Ouzan in ''Jewish Political Studies Review'' 19:1–2 (Spring 2007), see also [[Hannah Arendt]], ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]'' (published 1963)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961 a [[Herut]] no-confidence motion over the Lavon affair led to Ben-Gurion's resignation. Ben-Gurion declared that he would only accept office if Lavon was fired from the position of the head of [[Histadrut]], Israel's labour union organization. His demands were accepted and Mapai won the [[Israeli legislative election, 1961|1961 election]] (42 seats keeping Ben-Gurion as PM) with a slight reduction in its share of the seats. Menachem Begin's Herut party and the [[Liberal Party (Israel)|Liberals]] came next with 17 seats each. In 1962 the [[Mossad]] began assassinating German rocket scientists working in Egypt after one of them reported the missile program was designed to carry chemical warheads. This action was condemned by Ben-Gurion and led to the Mossad director, [[Isser Harel]], resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Isser Harel |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1422449/Isser-Harel.html |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 February 2003 |accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 Ben-Gurion quit again over the Lavon scandal. His attempts to make his party [[Mapai]] support him over the issue failed. [[Levi Eshkol]] became leader of Mapai and the new prime minister.

In 1963 [[Yigael Yadin]] began excavating [[Masada]]. In 1964, Egypt, Jordan and Syria developed a unified military command. Israel completed work on a [[National Water Carrier of Israel|national water carrier]], a huge engineering project designed to transfer Israel's allocation of the [[Jordan river]]'s waters towards the south of the country in realization of Ben-Gurion's dream of mass Jewish settlement of the [[Negev]] desert. The Arabs responded by trying to divert the headwaters of the Jordan, leading to growing [[War over Water (Jordan river)|conflict]] between Israel and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_periods3.html |title=The Disaster of 1967 |accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, Israeli Rabbinical authorities accepted that the [[Bene Israel]] of India were indeed Jewish and most of the remaining [[Indian Jews]] migrated to Israel. The 2,000-strong Jewish community of [[Cochin Jews|Cochin]] had already migrated in 1954. Ben-Gurion quit Mapai to form the new party [[Rafi (political party)|Rafi]], he was joined by [[Shimon Peres]] and [[Moshe Dayan]]. Begin's [[Herut]] party joined with the Liberals to form [[Gahal]]. Mapai and Labour united for the [[Israeli legislative election, 1965|1965 elections]], winning 45 seats and maintaining [[Levi Eshkol]] as Prime Minister. Ben-Gurion's Rafi party received 10 seats, Gahal got 26 seats becoming the second largest party.

Until 1966, Israel's principal arms supplier was [[France]], however in 1966, following the withdrawal from [[Algeria]], [[Politics of grandeur|Charles de Gaulle]] announced France would cease supplying Israel with arms (and refused to refund money paid for 50 warplanes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hnn.us/articles/751.html |title=When Did the U.S. and Israel Become Allies?

Included in the military hardware would be over 200 [[M48 Patton|M48 tanks]]. In May of that year the US also agreed to provide [[A-4 Skyhawk]] tactical aircraft to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.israeli-weapons.com/weapons/vehicles/tanks/magach/Patton_Tanks_in_Israeli_Service.htm|title=Patton Tanks in Israeli Service|website=www.israeli-weapons.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herring |first=George C. |title=The American Century and Beyond: U.S. Foreign Relations, 1893–2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E9VKDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA447|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2017 |page=447 |isbn=0190212470}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aloni |first=Shlomo |title=Israeli A-4 Skyhawk Units in Combat |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pXKHCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT8|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2013 |page=8 |isbn=1849081298}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 security restrictions placed on [[Arab-Israelis]] were eased and efforts made to integrate them into Israeli life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lustick |first=Ian |title=Arabs in the Jewish State: Israel's control of a national minority |url= |year=1980 |page=123 |isbn=0292703473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, [[Television in Israel|Black and white TV]] broadcasts began. On 15 May 1967, the first public performance of [[Naomi Shemer]]'s classic song "[[Jerusalem of Gold]]" took place and over the next few weeks it dominated the Israeli airwaves. Two days later Syria, Egypt and Jordan amassed troops along the Israeli borders, and Egypt closed the [[Straits of Tiran]] to Israeli shipping. Nasser demanded that the [[United Nations Emergency Force|UNEF]] leave Sinai, threatening escalation to a full war. Egyptian radio broadcasts talked of a coming genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1627015,00.html |title=In the Shadow of the Six-Day War |last=Mcgirk |first=Tim |date=31 May 2007 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sixdaywar.co.uk/timeline.htm |title=Six Day War Comprehensive Timeline |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tbsjournal.com/James.html |title=Whose Voice?

Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Iraq signed defence pacts and Iraqi troops began deploying to Jordan, Syria and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;The Times (London), 1st June 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Algeria also announced that it would send troops to Egypt. Between 1963 and 1967 [[Egypt and weapons of mass destruction|Egyptian troops had tested chemical weapons]] on Yemenite civilians as part of an [[North Yemen Civil War|Egyptian intervention in support of rebels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wcfia.harvard.edu/publications/forgotten-gas-attacks-yemen-haunt-syria-crisis|title=Forgotten Gas Attacks in Yemen Haunt Syria Crisis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel responded by calling up its civilian reserves, bringing much of the Israeli economy to a halt. The Israelis set up a national unity coalition, including for the first time [[Menachem Begin]]'s party, [[Herut]], in a coalition. During a national radio broadcast, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol stammered, causing widespread fear in Israel. To calm public concern [[Moshe Dayan]] (Chief of Staff during the Sinai war) was appointed Defence Minister.

On the morning before Dayan was sworn in, 5 June 1967, the Israeli air force launched [[Operation Focus|pre-emptive attacks]] destroying first the Egyptian air force, and then later the same day destroying the air forces of Jordan and Syria. Israel then [[Six-Day War|defeated]] (almost successively) Egypt, Jordan and Syria. By 11 June the Arab forces were routed and all parties had accepted the cease-fire called for by UN Security Council Resolutions 235 and 236. Israel gained control of the [[Sinai Peninsula]], the [[Gaza Strip]], the [[Golan Heights]], and the formerly Jordanian-controlled [[West Bank]] of the [[Jordan River]]. [[East Jerusalem]] was arguably&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lustick |first=Ian |date=January 1997 |title=Has Israel Annexed East Jerusalem? |journal=Middle East Policy |volume=V |issue=1 |pages=34–45 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Middle East Policy Council |issn=1061-1924 |oclc=4651987544 |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4967.1997.tb00247.x |accessdate=8 July 2007 |url=http://www.mepc.org/journal_vol5/9701_lustick.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120090306/http://www.mepc.org/journal_vol5/9701_lustick.asp |archivedate=20 November 2009 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerusalem Law|annexed]] by Israel. Residents were given permanent residency status and the option of applying for Israeli citizenship. The annexation was not recognized internationally (the Jordanian annexation of 1948 was also unrecognized).

Other areas occupied remained under military rule (Israeli civil law did not apply to them) pending a final settlement. The Golan was also [[Golan Heights Law|annexed]] in 1981. On 22 November 1967, the Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|Resolution 242]], the "land for peace" formula, which called for the establishment of a just and lasting peace based on Israeli withdrawal from territories occupied in 1967 in return for the end of all states of belligerency, respect for the sovereignty of all states in the area, and the right to live in peace within secure, recognized boundaries. The resolution was accepted by both sides, though with different interpretations, and has been the basis of all subsequent peace negotiations. After 1967 the US began supplying Israel with aircraft and the Soviet block (except Romania) [[Soviet Union and the Arab–Israeli conflict|broke off relations]] with Israel. [[1968 Polish political crisis|Antisemitic purges]] led to the final migration of the last [[Polish Jews]] to Israel.

For the first time since the end of the British Mandate, Jews could visit the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]] and pray at the [[Western Wall]] (the holiest site in modern Judaism), to which they had been denied access by the Jordanians in contravention of the 1949 Armistice agreement. The four-meter-wide public alley beside the Wall was expanded into a massive plaza and worshippers were allowed to sit, or use other furniture, for the first time in centuries. In [[Hebron]], Jews gained access to the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] (the second most holy site in Judaism) for the first time since the 14th century (previously Jews were only allowed to pray at the entrance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/special/israel/points_of_interest_cdo/aid/588225/jewish/Cave-of-the-Patriarchs.htm |title=Cave of the Patriarchs |publisher=Chabad |accessdate=2 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318073338/http://www.chabad.org/special/israel/points_of_interest_cdo/aid/588225/jewish/Cave-of-the-Patriarchs.htm |archivedate=18 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A third Jewish holy site, [[Rachel's Tomb]], in [[Bethlehem]], also became accessible. [[Energy in Egypt|Sinai oil fields]] made Israel self-sufficient in energy.

In 1968 [[Moshe Levinger]] led a group of [[Religious Zionist]]s who created the first [[Israeli settlement|Jewish settlement]], a town near Hebron called [[Kiryat Arba]]. There were no other religious settlements until after 1974. Ben-Gurion's [[Rafi (political party)|Rafi]] party merged with the Labour-Mapai alliance. Ben-Gurion remained outside as an independent. In 1968, compulsory education was extended until the age of 16 for all citizens (it had been 14) and the government embarked on an extensive program of [[Social integration|integration]] in education. In the major cities children from mainly [[Sephardi]]/[[Mizrahi]] neighbourhoods were [[bus]]ed to newly established [[middle school]]s in better areas. The system remained in place until after 2000.

In March 1968, Israeli forces attacked the Palestinian militia, [[Fatah]], at its [[Battle of Karameh|base in the Jordanian town of Karameh]]. The attack was in response to land mines placed on Israeli roads. The Israelis retreated after destroying the camp, however the Israelis sustained unexpectedly high casualties and the attack was not viewed as a success. Despite heavy casualties, the Palestinians claimed victory, while Fatah and the [[PLO]] (of which it formed part) became famous across the Arab world. In early 1969, fighting broke out between Egypt and Israel along the Suez Canal. In retaliation for repeated Egyptian shelling of Israeli positions along the Suez Canal, Israeli planes made deep strikes into Egypt in the 1969–1970 "[[War of Attrition]]".

In early 1969, Levi Eshkol died in office of a heart attack and [[Golda Meir]] became Prime Minister with the largest percentage of the vote ever won by an Israeli party, winning 56 of the 120 seats after the [[Israeli legislative election, 1969|1969 election]].

[[File:MV Netanya.jpg|thumb|MV ''Netanya'', one of the ships assigned to support boats in the [[Cherbourg Project]]]]

In December 1969, Israeli naval commandos [[Cherbourg Project|took five missile boats]] during the night from Cherbourg Harbour in France. Israel had paid for the boats but the French had refused to supply them. In July 1970 the Israelis [[Operation Rimon 20|shot down five Soviet fighters]] that were aiding the Egyptians in the course of the [[War of Attrition]]. Following this, the US worked to calm the situation and in August 1970 a cease fire was agreed.

In [[Black September in Jordan|September 1970]] [[King Hussein]] of [[Jordan]] drove the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] out of his country. On September 18, 1970, Syrian tanks invaded Jordan, intending to aid the PLO. At the request of the US, Israel moved troops to the border and threatened Syria, causing the Syrians to withdraw. The centre of PLO activity then shifted to [[Lebanon]], where the 1969 [[Cairo Agreement (1969)|Cairo agreement]] gave the Palestinians autonomy within the south of the country. The area controlled by the PLO became known by the international press and locals as "[[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon|Fatahland]]" and contributed to the 1975–1990 [[Lebanese Civil War]]. The event also led to [[Hafez al-Assad]] taking power in Syria. Egyptian President Nasser died immediately after and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]].

Increased [[Zionology|Soviet antisemitism]] and enthusiasm generated by the 1967 victory led to a wave of Soviet Jews applying to [[Aliyah from the Soviet Union in the 1970s|emigrate]] to Israel. Those who left could only take two suitcases. Most Jews were [[Refusenik|refused exit visas]] and persecuted by the authorities. Some were arrested and sent to [[Gulag]] camps, becoming known as [[Prisoners of Zion]]. During 1971, violent demonstrations by the [[Israeli Black Panthers]], made the Israeli public aware of resentment among [[Mizrahi]] Jews at ongoing discrimination and social gaps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europe-solidaire.org/spip.php?page=article_impr&amp;id_article=3744 |title=30 years to the Black Panthers in Israel |last=Chetrit |first=Sami Shalom |year=2003 |accessdate=4 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603110755/http://www.europe-solidaire.org/spip.php?page=article_impr&amp;id_article=3744 |archivedate=3 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 the US [[Jewish Mafia]] leader, [[Meyer Lansky]], who had taken refuge in Israel, was deported to the United States.

At the 1972 [[Munich Olympics]], two members of the Israeli team were killed, and nine members [[Munich massacre|taken hostage by Palestinian terrorists]]. A botched German rescue attempt [[Munich Massacre|led to the death of the rest]] along with five of the eight hijackers.

In 1972 the new Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]] expelled the Soviet advisers from Egypt. This and frequent invasion exercises by Egypt and Syria led to Israeli complacency about the threat from these countries. In addition the desire not to be held responsible for initiating conflict and an election campaign highlighting security, led to an Israeli failure to mobilize, despite receiving warnings of an impending attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/a-royal-s-life-1.243745 |title=A royal's life |last=Shamir |first=Shimon |date=10 April 2008 |newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Israeli Tanks Cross the Suez Canal - Flickr - Israel Defense Forces.jpg|thumb|left|143rd Division crossing the [[Suez Canal]] in the direction of [[Cairo]] during the [[Yom Kippur War]], 15 October 1973]]

The [[Yom Kippur War]] (also known as the October War) began on 6 October 1973 (the Jewish [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]]), the holiest day in the Jewish calendar and a day when adult Jews are required to fast. The Syrian and Egyptian armies launched a well-planned surprise attack against the unprepared Israeli Defense Forces. For the first few days there was a great deal of uncertainty about Israel's capacity to repel the invaders. Both the Soviets and the Americans (at the orders of [[Richard Nixon]]) [[Operation Nickel Grass|rushed arms to their allies]]. The Syrians were repulsed by the [[Valley of Tears|tiny remnant of the Israeli tank force]] on the Golan and, although the Egyptians captured a strip of territory in Sinai, Israeli forces [[Battle of Ismailia|crossed the Suez Canal]], trapping the Egyptian Third Army in Sinai and were 100 kilometres from Cairo. The war cost Israel over 2,000 dead, resulted in a heavy arms bill (for both sides) and made Israelis more aware of their vulnerability. It also led to heightened [[DEFCON|superpower tension]]. Following the war, both Israelis and Egyptians showed greater willingness to negotiate. On 18 January 1974, extensive diplomacy by US Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] led to a [[United Nations Disengagement Observer Force Zone|Disengagement of Forces agreement]] with the Egyptian government and on 31 May with the Syrian government.

The war led the Saudi government to initiate the [[1973 oil crisis]], an oil embargo in conjunction with [[OPEC]], against countries trading with Israel. Severe shortages led to massive increases in the price of oil, and as a result, many countries broke off relations with Israel or downgraded relations, and Israel was banned from participation in the [[Asian Games]] and other Asian sporting events.

State funding was introduced for elected parties. The new system made parties independent of wealthy donors and gave Knesset members more power over party funding, however it also made them less dependent on existing party structures and able to take their funding elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.knesset.gov.il/mmm/data/pdf/me00636.pdf accessed March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the December 1973 elections, Gahal and a number of right-wing parties united to form the [[Likud]] (led by Begin). In the [[Israeli legislative election, 1973|December 1973 elections]], Labour won 51 seats, leaving Golda Meir as Prime Minister. The Likud won 39 seats.

In May 1974, [[DFLP|Palestinians]] attacked a school in [[Ma'alot massacre|Ma'alot]], holding 102 children hostage. Twenty-two children were killed. In November 1974 the PLO was granted observer status at the UN and [[Yasser Arafat]] addressed the General Assembly. Later that year the [[Agranat Commission]], appointed to assess responsibility for Israel's lack of preparedness for the war, exonerated the government of responsibility, and held the [[David Elazar|Chief of Staff]] and [[Eli Zeira|head of military intelligence]] responsible. Despite the report, public anger at the Government led to [[Golda Meir]]'s resignation.

Following Meir's resignation, [[Yitzhak Rabin]] (Chief of Staff during the Six Day War) became prime minister. [[Modern Orthodox Jews]] ([[Religious Zionist]] followers of the teachings of [[Abraham Isaac Kook|Rabbi Kook]]), formed the [[Gush Emunim]] movement, and began an organized drive to settle the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]]. In November 1975 the United Nations General Assembly, under the guidance of Austrian Secretary General [[Kurt Waldheim]], adopted [[UN General Assembly Resolution 3379|Resolution 3379]], which asserted [[Zionism]] to be a form of racism. The General Assembly rescinded this resolution in December 1991 with [[UN General Assembly Resolution 46/86|Resolution 46/86]]. In March 1976 there was a massive [[Land Day#The protest of 1976|strike by Israeli-Arabs]] in protest at a government plan to expropriate land in the Galilee.

In July 1976, an [[Air France]] plane carrying 260 people was hijacked by [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – External Operations|Palestinian]] and [[Revolutionary Cells (RZ)|German]] terrorists and flown to Uganda, then ruled by [[Idi Amin Dada]]. There, the Germans separated the Jewish passengers from the non-Jewish passengers, releasing the non-Jews. The hijackers threatened to kill the remaining, 100-odd Jewish passengers (and the French crew who had refused to leave). Despite the distances involved, Rabin ordered a daring [[Operation Entebbe|rescue operation]] in which the kidnapped Jews were freed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Terrorism/entebbe.html |title=The Entebbe Rescue Mission |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; UN Secretary General Waldheim described the raid as "a serious violation of the national sovereignty of a United Nations member state" (meaning Uganda).&lt;ref&gt;''National Review'', 9 July 2007, vol.

In 1976, the ongoing [[Lebanese Civil War]] led Israel to allow South Lebanese to [[Good Fence|cross the border]] and work in Israel. In January 1977, French authorities arrested [[Abu Daoud]], the planner of the Munich massacre, releasing him a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945702-3,00.html | work=Time | title=Terrorists: L'Affaire Daoud: Too Hot to Handle | date=24 January 1977 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1977 [[Anatoly Sharansky]], a prominent [[Refusenik]] and spokesman for the [[Moscow Helsinki Group]], was sentenced to 13 years' hard labour.

Rabin resigned on April 1977 after it emerged that his [[Leah Rabin|wife]] maintained a dollar account in the United States (illegal at the time), which had been opened while Rabin was Israeli ambassador. The incident became known as the [[Dollar Account affair]]. [[Shimon Peres]] informally replaced him as prime minister, leading the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]] in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|subsequent elections]].

===1977–1983: Begin===
{{Further|Camp David Accords|1978 South Lebanon conflict|1982 Lebanon War}}
{{See also2|[[Eighteenth government of Israel|Eighteenth]]|[[Nineteenth government of Israel|Nineteenth]] governments of Israel}}
In a surprise result, the [[Likud]] led by [[Menachem Begin]] won 43 seats in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 elections]] (Labour got 32 seats). This was the first time in Israeli history that the government was not led by the left. A key reason for the victory was anger among [[Mizrahi Jews]] at discrimination, which was to play an important role in Israeli politics for many years. Talented small town Mizrahi social activists, unable to advance in the Labour party, were readily embraced by Begin. Moroccan-born [[David Levy (Israeli politician)|David Levy]] and Iranian-born [[Moshe Katzav]] were part of a group who won Mizrahi support for Begin. Many Labour voters voted for the [[Democratic Movement for Change]] (15 seats) in protest at high-profile corruption cases. The party joined in coalition with Begin and disappeared at the next election.

In addition to starting a process of healing the Mizrahi–[[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] divide, Begin's government included [[Agudat Israel|Ultra-Orthodox Jews]] and was instrumental in healing the Zionist–Ultra-Orthodox rift, however it did so at the cost of expanding the exemption from military service to all [[Haredi]] Jewish students of military age. This led to creation of a huge class of unemployed Haredi Jews (the exemption was conditional on attendance of a religious seminary, so they kept studying until they were too old for military service). By remaining students, they were a massive burden on the state, while also failing to participate in the military burden.

Begin's liberalization of the economy led to [[hyper-inflation]] (around 150% inflation) but enabled Israel to begin receiving US financial aid. Begin actively supported [[Gush Emunim]]'s efforts to settle the [[West Bank]] and Jewish settlements in the occupied territories received government support, thus laying the grounds for intense conflict with the Palestinian population of the occupied territories.

In November 1977, Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]] broke 30 years of hostility with Israel by visiting Jerusalem at the invitation of Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]]. Sadat's two-day visit included a speech before the [[Knesset]] and was a turning point in the history of the conflict. The Egyptian leader created a new psychological climate in the [[Middle East]] in which peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours seemed possible. Sadat recognized Israel's right to exist and established the basis for direct negotiations between Egypt and Israel. Following Sadat's visit, 350 Yom Kippur War veterans organized the [[Peace Now]] movement to encourage Israeli governments to make peace with the Arabs.

In March 1978, eleven armed Lebanese Palestinians reached Israel in boats and [[Coastal Road Massacre|hijacked a bus]] carrying families on a day outing, killing 38 people, including 13 children. The attackers opposed the Egyptian–Israeli peace process. Three days later, Israeli forces crossed into Lebanon beginning [[Operation Litani]]. After passage of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 425]], calling for Israeli withdrawal and the creation of the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] (UNIFIL) peace-keeping force, Israel withdrew its troops.

In September 1978, US President [[Jimmy Carter]] invited President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin to meet with him at [[Camp David]], and on 11 September they agreed on a [[Camp David Accords|framework]] for peace between Israel and Egypt, and a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. It set out broad principles to guide negotiations between Israel and the Arab states. It also established guidelines for a West Bank–Gaza transitional regime of full autonomy for the Palestinians residing in these territories, and for a [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|peace treaty between Egypt and Israel]]. The treaty was signed 26 March 1979 by Begin and Sadat, with President Carter signing as witness. Under the treaty, Israel returned the Sinai peninsula to Egypt in April 1982. The final piece of territory to be repatriated was [[Taba (Egypt)|Taba]], adjacent to [[Eilat]], returned in 1989. The [[Arab League]] reacted to the peace treaty by suspending Egypt from the organization and moving its headquarters from [[Cairo]] to [[Tunis]]. [[Sadat]] was assassinated in 1981 by [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad|Islamic fundamentalist]] members of the Egyptian army who opposed peace with Israel. Following the agreement Israel and Egypt became the two largest [[United States foreign aid|recipients]] of [[United States Agency for International Development|US military and financial aid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/124970.pdf |title=Foreign Aid: An Introduction to U.S. Programs and Policy |last1=Tarnoff |first1=Curt |last2=Lawson |first2=Marian Leonardo |date=9 April 2009 |work=CRS Reports |publisher=Congressional Research Service |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Iraq and Afghanistan have now [[Financial cost of the Iraq War|overtaken them]]).

In December 1978 the Israeli [[Merkava]] battle tank entered use with the IDF. In 1979, over 40,000 [[Iranian Jews]] migrated to Israel, escaping the [[Islamic Revolution]] there. On 30 June 1981, the Israeli air force [[Operation Opera|destroyed the Osirak nuclear reactor]] that [[France]] was building for [[Iraq]]. Three weeks later, Begin won yet again, in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|1981 elections]] (48 seats Likud, 47 Labour). [[Ariel Sharon]] was made defence minister. The new government [[Golan Heights Law|annexed the Golan Heights]] and banned the [[El Al|national airline]] from flying on [[Shabbat]].&lt;ref name="shabbat"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishgates.org/history/modhis/elal.stm | title=El-Al, Israel's Airline | publisher=Gates of Jewish Heritage |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010222124207/http://www.jewishgates.org/history/modhis/elal.stm |archivedate = 2001-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1980s a diverse set of [[Science and technology in Israel|high-tech]] industries had [[Silicon Wadi|developed]] in Israel.

In the decades following the 1948 war, Israel's border with [[Lebanon]] was quiet compared to its borders with other neighbours. But the 1969 [[Cairo Agreement (1969)|Cairo agreement]] gave the PLO a free hand to [[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon|attack]] Israel from South Lebanon. The area was governed by the PLO independently of the Lebanese Government and became known as "[[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon|Fatahland]]" ([[Fatah]] was the largest faction in the PLO). Palestinian irregulars constantly [[Katyusha rocket launcher|shelled]] the Israeli north, especially the town of [[Kiryat Shmona]], which was a Likud stronghold inhabited primarily by Jews who had fled the Arab world. Lack of control over Palestinian areas was an important factor in causing [[Lebanese civil war|civil war in Lebanon]].

In June 1982, the attempted assassination of [[Shlomo Argov]], the ambassador to Britain, was used as a pretext for an Israeli invasion aiming to drive the PLO out of the southern half of Lebanon. Sharon agreed with [[Chief of General Staff (Israel)|Chief of Staff]] [[Raphael Eitan]] to expand the invasion deep into Lebanon even though the cabinet had only authorized a 40 kilometre deep invasion.&lt;ref&gt;''Israel's Lebanon War'' by [[Ze'ev Schiff]] and [[Ehud Ya'ari]], Touchstone 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion became known as the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and the Israeli army occupied [[Beirut]], the only time an Arab capital has been occupied by Israel. Some of the [[Shi'a Islam in Lebanon|Shia]] and [[Maronites|Christian]] population of [[South Lebanon]] welcomed the Israelis, as PLO forces had maltreated them, but Lebanese resentment of Israeli occupation grew over time and the [[Amal Movement|Shia]] became gradually [[Musa al-Sadr|radicalized]] under Iranian guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gloria-center.org/2000/09/eisenberg-2000-09-02/ |title=Do Good Fences Make Good Neighbors?: Israel and Lebanon after the Withdrawal |last=Eisenberg |first=Laura Zittrain |date=2 September 2000 |work=Middle East Review of International Affairs |publisher=Global Research in International Affairs (GLORIA) Center |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constant casualties among Israeli soldiers and Lebanese civilians led to growing opposition to the war in Israel.

In August 1982, the PLO withdrew its forces from Lebanon (moving to [[Tunisia]]). Israel helped engineer the election of a new Lebanese president, [[Bashir Gemayel]], who agreed to recognize Israel and sign a peace treaty. Gemayal was assassinated before an agreement could be signed, and one day later [[Kataeb Party|Phalangist]] Christian forces led by [[Elie Hobeika]] entered two Palestinian refugee camps and [[Sabra and Shatila massacre|massacred]] the occupants. The massacres led to the biggest [[anti-war protest|demonstration]] ever in Israel against the war, with as many as 400,000 people (almost 10% of the population) gathering in Tel Aviv. In 1983, an [[Kahan commission|Israeli public inquiry]] found that Israel's defence minister, Sharon, was indirectly but personally responsible for the massacres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Belgium opens way for Sharon trial |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2662635.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=15 January 2003 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also recommended that he never again be allowed to hold the post (it did not forbid him from being Prime Minister). In 1983, the [[May 17 Agreement]] was signed between Israel and Lebanon, paving the way for an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese territory through a few stages. Israel continued to operate against the PLO until its eventual departure in 1985, and kept a small force stationed in Southern Lebanon in support of the [[South Lebanon Army]] until May 2000.

In September 1983, Begin resigned and was succeeded by [[Yitzhak Shamir]] as prime minister. The [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984 election]] was inconclusive, and led to a power sharing agreement between [[Shimon Peres]] of the Alignment (44 seats) and Shamir of Likud (41 seats). Peres was prime minister from 1984 to 1986 and Shamir from 1986 to 1988. In 1984, continual discrimination against Sephardi Ultra-Orthodox Jews by the Ashkenazi Ultra-Orthodox establishment led political activist [[Aryeh Deri]] to leave the [[Agudat Israel]] party and join former chief [[Rabbi Ovadia Yosef]] in forming [[Shas]], a new party aimed at the non-Ashkenazi Ultra-Orthodox vote. The party won 4 seats in the first election it contested and over the next twenty years was the third largest party in the Knesset. Shas established a nationwide network of free Sephardi Orthodox schools. In 1984, during a severe [[1983–85 famine in Ethiopia|famine]] in [[Ethiopia]], 8,000 [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]] were [[Operation Moses|secretly transported]] to Israel. In 1986 [[Natan Sharansky]], a famous Russian human rights activist and Zionist [[refusenik]] (denied an exit visa), was released from the [[Gulag]] in return for two Soviet spies.

In June 1985, Israel withdrew most of its troops from Lebanon, leaving a residual Israeli force and an Israeli-supported [[South Lebanon Army|militia]] in [[southern Lebanon]] as a "[[Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon|security zone]]" and buffer against attacks on its northern territory. Since then, IDF [[South Lebanon conflict (1982–2000)|fought]] for many years against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] organization [[Hezbollah]], which became a growing threat to Israel. By July 1985, Israel's [[1983 Israel bank stock crisis|inflation]], buttressed by complex [[index linking]] of salaries, had reached 480% per annum and was the highest in the world. Peres introduced [[1985 Israel Economic Stabilization Plan|emergency control of prices]] and cut government expenditure successfully bringing inflation under control. The currency (known as the [[old Israeli shekel]]) was replaced and renamed the [[Israeli new shekel]] at a rate of 1,000 old shkalim = 1 new shekel. In October 1985, Israel responded to a Palestinian terrorist attack in Cyprus by [[Operation Wooden Leg|bombing]] the PLO headquarters in Tunis. Growing Israeli settlement and continuing occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, led to the [[First Intifada|first Palestinian Intifada]] (uprising) in 1987, which lasted until the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]], despite Israeli attempts to suppress it. [[Human rights]] abuses by Israeli troops led a group of Israelis to form [[B'Tselem]], an organization devoted to improving awareness and compliance with human rights requirements in Israel.

In August 1987, the Israeli government cancelled the [[IAI Lavi]] project, an attempt to develop an independent Israeli fighter aircraft. The Israelis found themselves unable to sustain the huge development costs, and faced US opposition to a project that threatened US influence in Israel and US global military ascendancy. In September 1988, Israel launched an [[Ofeq]] reconnaissance satellite into orbit, using a [[Shavit]] rocket, thus becoming one of only eight countries possessing a capacity to [[Timeline of first orbital launches by country|independently launch satellites]] into space (two more have since developed this ability). The Alignment and Likud remained neck and neck in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1988|1988 elections]] (39:40 seats). Shamir successfully formed a national unity coalition with [[Alignment (political party)|the Labour Alignment]]. In March 1990, Alignment leader [[Shimon Peres]] engineered a defeat of the government in a non-confidence vote and then tried to form a new government. [[The dirty trick (Israel)|He failed]] and Shamir became prime minister at the head of a right-wing coalition.

In 1990, the [[Soviet Union]] finally permitted free [[Aliyah from the Commonwealth of Independent States in the 1990s|emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel]]. Prior to this, Jews trying to leave the USSR faced [[Refusenik (Soviet Union)|persecution]]; those who succeeded arrived as refugees. Over the next few years some one million Soviet citizens migrated to Israel. Although there was concern that some of the new immigrants had only a very tenuous connection to Judaism, and many were accompanied by non-Jewish relatives, this massive wave of migration slowly transformed Israel, bringing large numbers of highly educated Soviet Jews and creating a powerful Russian culture in Israel.

In August 1990, Iraq invaded [[Kuwait]], triggering the [[Gulf War]] between Iraq and a large allied force, led by the [[United States]]. Iraq attacked Israel with 39 [[Scud missile]]s. Israel did not retaliate at request of the US, fearing that if Israel responded against Iraq, other Arab nations might desert the allied coalition. Israel provided gas masks for both the Palestinian population and Israeli citizens, while Netherlands and the United States deployed [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot defence batteries]] in Israel as protection against the Scuds. In May 1991, during a 36-hour period, 15,000 [[Beta Israel]] (Ethiopian Jews) were [[Operation Solomon|secretly airlifted]] to Israel. The coalition's victory in the Gulf War opened new possibilities for regional peace, and in October 1991 the US President, [[George H.W. Bush]], and Soviet Union Premier, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], jointly convened a [[Madrid Conference of 1991|historic meeting in Madrid]] of Israeli, Lebanese, Jordanian, Syrian, and Palestinian leaders. Shamir opposed the idea but agreed in return for loan guarantees to help with absorption of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. His participation in the conference led to the collapse of his (right-wing) coalition.

In the [[Israeli legislative election, 1992|1992 elections]], the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labour Party]], led by [[Yitzhak Rabin]], won a significant victory (44 seats) promising to pursue peace while promoting Rabin as a "tough general" and pledging not to deal with the PLO in any way. The pro-peace Zionist party [[Meretz]] won 12 seats, and the Arab and communist parties a further 5, meaning that parties supporting a peace treaty had a full (albeit small) majority in the Knesset. Later that year, the Israeli electoral system was changed to allow for direct election of the prime minister. It was hoped this would reduce the power of small parties (mainly the religious parties) to extract concessions in return for coalition agreements. The new system had the opposite effect; voters could split their vote for prime minister from their (interest based) party vote, and as a result larger parties won fewer votes and smaller parties becoming more attractive to voters. It thus increased the power of the smaller parties. By the 2006 election the system was abandoned.

On 25 July 1993, Israel carried out a week-long [[Operation Accountability|military operation]] in Lebanon to attack [[Hezbollah]] positions. On 13 September 1993, Israel and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) signed the [[Oslo Accords]] (a Declaration of Principles)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/Peace/dop.html Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302173924/http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/Peace/dop.html |date=2 March 2017 }} Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt; on the South Lawn of the [[White House]]. The principles established objectives relating to a transfer of authority from Israel to an interim [[Palestinian Authority]], as a prelude to a final treaty establishing a Palestinian state, in exchange for mutual recognition. The DOP established May 1999 as the date by which a permanent status agreement for the West Bank and Gaza Strip would take effect. In February 1994, [[Baruch Goldstein]], a follower of the [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]] party, killed 29 Palestinians and wounded 125 at the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] in [[Hebron]], which became known as the [[Cave of the Patriarchs massacre]]. Kach had been barred from participation in the 1992 elections (on the grounds that the movement was racist). It was subsequently made illegal. Israel and the PLO signed the [[Gaza–Jericho Agreement]] in May 1994, and the [[Agreement on Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities]] in August, which began the process of transferring authority from Israel to the Palestinians. On 25 July 1994, Jordan and Israel signed the [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty|Washington Declaration]], which formally ended the [[war|state of war]] that had existed between them since 1948 and on 26 October the [[Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace]], witnessed by US President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/Main%20Points%20of%20Israel-Jordan%20Peace%20Treaty Main Points of Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty 26 October 1994] Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/peacetreaty.html Treaty of Peace between The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and The State of Israel] King Hussein website&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and PLO Chairman [[Yasser Arafat]] signed the [[Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip|Israeli–Palestinian Interim Agreement]] on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip on 28 September 1995 in Washington. The agreement was witnessed by President Bill Clinton on behalf of the United States and by Russia, Egypt, Norway and the European Union, and incorporates and supersedes the previous agreements, marking the conclusion of the first stage of negotiations between Israel and the PLO. The agreement allowed the PLO leadership to relocate to the occupied territories and granted autonomy to the Palestinians with talks to follow regarding final status. In return the Palestinians promised to abstain from use of terror and changed the [[Palestinian National Covenant]], which had called for the expulsion of all Jews who migrated after 1917 and the elimination of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mideastweb.org/plocha.htm|title=PLO Covenant (Charter) 1968|website=www.mideastweb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement was opposed by [[Hamas]] and other Palestinian factions, which launched [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks#1990s|suicide bomber attacks]] at Israel. Rabin had a [[Israeli Gaza Strip barrier|barrier]] constructed around Gaza to prevent attacks. The growing separation between Israel and the "[[Palestinian Territories]]" led to a labour shortage in Israel, mainly in the construction industry. Israeli firms began importing [[Demographics of Israel#Foreign workers|labourers]] from the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[China]] and [[Romania]]; some of these labourers stayed on without visas. In addition, a growing number of Africans began illegally migrating to Israel. On 4 November 1995, a far-right-wing [[Yigal Amir|religious Zionist]] opponent of the [[Oslo Accords]], [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin]]. In February 1996 Rabin's successor, [[Shimon Peres]], called early elections. In April 1996, Israel launched an [[Operation Grapes of Wrath|operation]] in southern Lebanon as a result of Hezbollah's [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha]] [[List of Lebanese rocket attacks on Israel|rocket attacks]] on Israeli population centres along the border.

The May 1996 [[Israeli legislative election, 1996|elections]] were the first featuring [[Israeli prime ministerial election, 1996|direct election of the prime minister]] and resulted in a narrow election victory for [[Likud]] leader [[Binyamin Netanyahu]]. A spate of suicide bombings reinforced the Likud position for security. [[Hamas]] claimed responsibility for most of the bombings. Despite his stated differences with the [[Oslo Accords]], Prime Minister Netanyahu continued their implementation, but his prime ministership saw a marked slow-down in the Peace Process. Netanyahu also pledged to gradually reduce US aid to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/boldaid.html |title=Israel's Bold Initiative to Reduce U.S. Aid |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1996, a [[Western Wall Tunnel#Northern exit|Palestinian riot]] broke out against the creation of an exit in the Western Wall tunnel. Over the subsequent few weeks, around 80 people were killed as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/548443.stm |title=Mayor halts Temple Mount dig |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=5 May 2009 | date=3 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_15349.html |title=Palestinian Authority |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1997 Netanyahu signed the [[Hebron Protocol]] with the Palestinian Authority, resulting in the redeployment of Israeli forces in [[Hebron]] and the turnover of civilian authority in much of the area to the Palestinian Authority.

In the [[Israeli legislative election, 1999|election]] of July 1999, [[Ehud Barak]] of the Labour Party became Prime Minister. His party was the largest in the Knesset with 26 seats. In September 1999 the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] ruled that the use of torture in interrogation of Palestinian prisoners was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stoptorture.org.il/en/skira90-99 |title=1990–1999 &amp;#124; הוועד הציבורי נגד עינויים בישראל |publisher=Stoptorture.org.il |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807200124/http://www.stoptorture.org.il/en/skira90-99 |archivedate=7 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 March 2000, [[Pope John Paul II]] arrived in Israel for a historic visit.

On 25 May 2000, Israel unilaterally [[South Lebanon conflict (1982–2000)#2000: Israeli withdrawal|withdrew]] its remaining forces from the "security zone" in southern Lebanon. Several thousand members of the [[South Lebanon Army]] (and their families) left with the Israelis. The UN Secretary-General concluded&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2000/20000618.sc6878.doc.html Security Council endorses Secretary-General's conclusion on Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon as of 16 June] United Nations, 18 June 2000&lt;/ref&gt; that, as of 16 June 2000, Israel had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in accordance with [[UN Security Council Resolution 425]].

In the Fall of 2000, [[2000 Camp David Summit|talks were held at Camp David]] to reach a final agreement on the Israel/Palestine conflict. Ehud Barak offered to meet most of the Palestinian teams requests for territory and [[concession (politics)|political concessions]], including Arab parts of east Jerusalem; however, Arafat abandoned the talks without making a counterproposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iris.org.il/camp_david2.htm Israeli Proposal to Palestinians and Syria] Information Regarding Israel's Security (IRIS)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following its withdrawal from South Lebanon, Israel became a member of the [[Western European and Others Group]] at the United Nations. Prior to this Israel was the only nation at the UN which was not a member of any group (The Arab states would not allow it to join the Asia group), which meant it could not be a member of the Security Council or appoint anyone to the International Court and other key UN roles. Since December 2013 it has been a permanent member of the group.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/depts/DGACM/RegionalGroups.shtml see the note at the bottom.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2000, [[Aryeh Deri]] was sentenced to 3 years in prison for bribe taking. Deri is regarded as the mastermind behind the rise of Shas and was a government minister at the age of 24. Political manipulation meant the investigation lasted for years. Deri subsequently sued a Police Officer who alleged that he was linked to the traffic-accident death of a witness, who was run over in New York by a driver who had once been in the employ of an associate of Deri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=	Dalia Shehori |date=5 March 2003 |title='If I could sue the judges for libel, I would': Aryeh Deri sues a police commander to clear his name |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/if-i-could-sue-the-judges-for-libel-i-would-1.17233 |newspaper=Haaretz |accessdate=2 April 2015}}, see also {{cite web |date=16 January 2011 |title=&lt;bdi dir="rtl"&gt;מה חלקו של אריה דרעי ברצח חמותו אסתר ורדבר?&lt;/bdi&gt; |language=he |trans-title=What was the share of Aryeh Deri in the murder of his mother-in-law Esther Bradbury |url=http://bektzara.blogspot.co.il/2012/10/blog-post_8671.html |publisher=חדשות בקצרה בתמונות ומסמכים (News briefs, photos and documents) |accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 September 2000, Israeli opposition leader [[Ariel Sharon]] visited the Al-Aqsa compound, or [[Temple Mount]], the following day the Palestinians launched the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]]. David Samuels and Khaled Abu Toameh have stated that the uprising was planned much earlier.&lt;ref name=toameh&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=29 March 2006 |url=http://www.mafhoum.com/press3/111P55.htm |title=How the war began |author=Khaled Abu Toameh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/09/in-a-ruined-country/304167/ |title=In a Ruined Country |last=Samuels |first=David |date=September 2005 |work=[[The Atlantic]] |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2000, Palestinians destroyed [[Joseph's Tomb]], a Jewish shrine in [[Nablus]].

The [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow missile]], a missile designed to destroy [[ballistic missile]]s, including [[Scud missile]]s, was first deployed by Israel. In 2001, with the Peace Process increasingly in disarray, Ehud Barak called a [[Israeli prime ministerial election, 2001|special election for Prime Minister]]. Barak hoped a victory would give him renewed authority in negotiations with the Palestinians. Instead opposition leader [[Ariel Sharon]] was elected PM. After this election, the system of directly electing the Premier was abandoned.

[[File:Westbank barrier.png|thumb|upright|The [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] route built (red), under construction (pink) and proposed (white), {{as of|2011|6|lc=on}}]]
The failure of the peace process, increased Palestinian terror and occasional [[2000–2006 Shebaa Farms conflict|attacks]] by [[Hezbollah]] from Lebanon, led much of the Israeli public and political leadership to lose confidence in the Palestinian Authority as a peace partner. Most felt that many Palestinians viewed the peace treaty with Israel as a temporary measure only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Karsh |first=Efraim |title=Islamic Imperialism: A History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmZP3mixescC&amp;pg=PA181|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2006 |page=181 |isbn=0300106033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Israelis were thus anxious to disengage from the Palestinians. In response to a wave of [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks#2000s|suicide bomb attacks]], culminating in the "[[Passover massacre]]" (see [[List of Israeli civilian casualties in the Second Intifada]]), Israel launched [[Operation Defensive Shield]] in March 2002, and Sharon began the construction of a [[Israeli West Bank barrier|barrier]] around the West Bank. Around the same time, the Israeli town of [[Sderot]] and other Israeli communities near Gaza became subject to constant [[Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel|shelling]] and mortar bomb attacks from Gaza.

Thousands of Jews from Latin America began [[Aliyah from Latin America in the 2000s|arriving]] in Israel due to economic crises in their countries of origin. In January 2003 separate [[Israeli legislative election, 2003|elections]] were held for the Knesset. Likud won the most seats (27). An anti-religion party, [[Shinui]], led by media pundit [[Tommy Lapid]], won 15 seats on a secularist platform, making it the third largest party (ahead of orthodox [[Shas]]). Internal fighting led to Shinui's demise at the next election. In 2004, the [[African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem|Black Hebrews]] were granted permanent residency in Israel. The group had begun migrating to Israel 25 years earlier from the United States, but had not been recognized as Jews by the state and hence not granted citizenship under Israel's [[Law of Return]]. They had settled in Israel without official status. From 2004 onwards, they received citizen's rights.

The Sharon government embarked on an extensive program of construction of [[Desalination#Israel|desalinization plants]] that freed Israel of the fear of drought. Some of the Israeli desalinization plants are the largest of their kind in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.water-technology.net/projects/israel/|title=Ashkelon Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) Plant, Israel|website=Water Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2004, Israel launched [[Operation Rainbow (2004)|Operation Rainbow]] in southern Gaza to create a safer environment for the IDF soldiers along the [[Philadelphi Route]]. On September 30, 2004, Israel carried out [[Operation Days of Penitence]] in northern Gaza to destroy the launching sites of Palestinian rockets which were used to attack Israeli towns. In 2005, all Jewish settlers were evacuated from [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] (some forcibly) and their homes demolished. [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|Disengagement from the Gaza Strip]] was completed on 12 September 2005. Military disengagement from the northern West Bank was completed ten days later.

In 2005 Sharon left the Likud and formed a new party called [[Kadima]], which accepted that the peace process would lead to creation of a Palestinian state. He was joined by many leading figures from both Likud and Labour.

Hamas won the [[Palestinian legislative election, 2006]], the first and only genuinely free Palestinian elections. Hamas' leaders rejected all agreements signed with Israel, refused to recognize Israel's right to exist, refused to abandon terror, and occasionally [[Hamas–UNRWA Holocaust dispute|claimed the Holocaust was a Jewish conspiracy]]. The withdrawal and Hamas victory left the status of Gaza unclear, Israel claimed it was no longer an occupying power but continued to control air and sea access to Gaza although it did not exercise [[sovereignty]] on the ground. Egypt insisted that it was still occupied and refused to open border crossings with Gaza, although it was free to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biu.ac.il/Besa/MSPS83.pdf |title=Is Gaza Occupied?

On April 2006 [[Ariel Sharon]] was incapacitated by a severe [[haemorrhagic stroke]] and [[Ehud Olmert]] became [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2003/3/Ehud+Olmert.htm |title=Ehud Olmert |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ehud Olmert]] was elected Prime Minister after his party, [[Kadima]], won the most seats (29) in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2006]]. In 2005 [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] was officially elected president of Iran; since then, Iranian policy towards Israel has grown more [[Israel–Iran proxy conflict|confrontational]]. Israeli analysts believe Ahmadinejad has worked to undermine the peace process with arms supplies and aid to Hezbullah in South Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2009/03/politics-iranrsquos-anti-israel-rhetoric-aimed-at-arab-opinion/ |title=Iran’s Anti-Israel Rhetoric Aimed at Arab Opinion |last=Porter |first=Gareth |date=9 March 2009 |publisher=Inter Press Service |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is [[Iran and weapons of mass destruction|developing nuclear weapons]], possibly for use against Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Threats_to_Israel/Iran.html |title=Potential Threats To Israel: Iran |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian support for Hezbollah and its nuclear arms program are in contravention of UN Security Council resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559|1559]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1747|1747]]. Iran also [[International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust|encourages Holocaust denial]]. Following the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, Hezbollah had mounted periodic attacks on Israel, which did not lead to Israeli retaliation. Similarly, the withdrawal from Gaza led to incessant shelling of towns around the Gaza area with only minimal Israeli response. The failure to react led to criticism from the Israeli right and undermined the government.

On 14 March 2006, Israel carried out an [[Operation Bringing Home the Goods|operation]] in the Palestinian Authority prison of [[Jericho]] in order to capture [[Ahmad Sa'adat]] and several Palestinian Arab prisoners located there who assassinated Israeli politician [[Rehavam Ze'evi]] in 2001. The operation was conducted as a result of the expressed intentions of the newly elected Hamas government to release these prisoners. On 25 June 2006, a Hamas force crossed the border from Gaza and [[2006 Hamas cross-border raid|attacked]] a tank, capturing Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]], sparking [[2006 Israel–Gaza conflict|clashes]] in Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/5142376.stm |title=In pictures: Gaza crisis |date=3 July 2006 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Idf back from lebanon.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nahal Brigade]] soldiers returning after the [[2006 Lebanon War]]]]

On 12 July, Hezbollah [[Zar'it-Shtula incident|attacked Israel]] from Lebanon, shelled Israeli towns and attacked a border patrol, taking two dead or badly wounded Israeli soldiers. These incidents led Israel to initiate the [[2006 Lebanon War|Second Lebanon War]], which lasted through August 2006. Israeli forces entered some villages in Southern Lebanon, while the air force attacked targets all across the country. Israel only made limited ground gains until the launch of [[Operation Changing Direction 11]], which lasted for 3 days with disputed results. Shortly before a UN ceasefire came into effect, Israeli troops [[Battle of Wadi Saluki|captured Wadi Saluki]]. The war concluded with Hezbollah evacuating its forces from Southern Lebanon, while the IDF remained until its positions could be handed over to the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] and [[UNIFIL]].

In 2007 education was made compulsory until the age of 18 for all citizens (it had been 16). Refugees from the [[War in Darfur|genocide in Darfur]], mostly Muslim, arrived in Israel illegally, with some given Asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1931160,00.html |title=Israel's Illegal Immigrants — and Their Children |last=Kalman |first=Matthew |date=21 October 2009 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Immigration/SudaneseRefugees.html |title=Sudanese Refugees in Israel |last=Scheinerman |first=Naomi |work=Jewish Virtual Library |publisher=American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise |accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Illegal immigration from Africa to Israel|Illegal immigrants]] arrived mainly from Africa in addition to foreign workers overstaying their visas. The numbers of such migrants are not known, and estimates vary between 30,000 and over 100,000.

An American billionaire casino owner, [[Sheldon Adelson]], set up a free newspaper [[Israel Hayom]] with the express intention of reducing the influence of the dominant (centre-left) newspaper [[Yediot Ahronot]] and causing a right-ward shift in Israeli politics by supporting Netanyahu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2016/israel|title=Israel|website=freedomhouse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 2007, the Israeli Air Force [[Operation Orchard|destroyed]] a nuclear reactor in Syria. On 28 February 2008, Israel launched a [[Operation Hot Winter|military campaign]] in Gaza in response to the constant firing of [[Qassam rocket]]s by Hamas militants. On July 16, 2008, Hezbollah [[2008 Israel-Hezbollah prisoner swap|swapped]] the bodies of Israeli soldiers [[Ehud Goldwasser]] and [[Eldad Regev]], kidnapped in 2006, in exchange for the Lebanese terrorist [[Samir Kuntar]], four [[Lebanese prisoners in Israel|Hezbollah prisoners]], and the bodies of 199 Palestinian Arab and Lebanese fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Israeli-experts-say-many-Lebanese-are-not-celebrating|first=Nathan|last=Cohen|newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=17 July 2008|title=Israeli experts say many Lebanese are not celebrating}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olmert came under investigation for corruption and this led him to announce on 30 July 2008, that he would be stepping down as Prime Minister following election of a new leader of the [[Kadima]] party in September 2008. [[Tzipi Livni]] won the election, but was unable to form a coalition and Olmert remained in office until the general election.

In the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|2009 legislative election]] Likud won 27 seats and Kadima 28; however, the right-wing camp won a majority of seats, and President Shimon Peres called on Netanyahu to form the government. Russian immigrant-dominated [[Yisrael Beiteinu]] came third with 15 seats, and Labour was reduced to fourth place with 13 seats. In 2009, Israeli billionaire [[Yitzhak Tshuva]] announced the discovery of [[Tamar gas field|huge natural gas reserves]] off the coast of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel Billionaire Tshuva Strikes Gas, Fueling Expansion in Energy, Hotels |first1=David |last1=Wainer |first2=Calev |last2=Ben-David |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-21/israel-billionaire-tshuva-strikes-gas-fueling-expansion-in-energy-hotels.html |newspaper=Bloomberg |date=22 April 2010 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 2010, an [[Gaza flotilla raid|international incident]] broke out in the Mediterranean Sea when foreign activists trying to break the [[Blockade of the Gaza Strip#Naval blockade|maritime blockade]] over Gaza, clashed with Israeli troops.

On 14 July 2011, the [[2011 Israeli housing protests|largest social protest in the history of Israel]] began in which hundreds of thousands of protesters from a variety of [[socio-economic]] and religious backgrounds in Israel protested against the continuing rise in the [[cost of living]] (particularly housing) and the deterioration of public services in the country (such as health and education). The peak of the demonstrations took place on 3 September 2011, in which about 400,000 people demonstrated across the country.

In October 2011, [[Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange|a deal was reached]] between Israel and [[Hamas]], by which the kidnapped Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]] was released in exchange for 1,027 [[Palestinian prisoners in Israel|Palestinians]] and [[Arab citizens of Israel|Arab-Israeli]] prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-10/17/c_131194865.htm Hamas to gain politically from prisoner swap deal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105105418/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-10/17/c_131194865.htm |date=5 January 2014 }}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30218">'''Homochirality''' is a uniformity of [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]], or handedness. Objects are ''chiral'' when they cannot be superposed on their mirror images. For example, the left and right hands of a human are approximately mirror images of each other but are not their own mirror images, so they are ''chiral''. In [[biology]], 19 of the 20 natural [[amino acid]]s are homochiral, being &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-chiral (left-handed), while [[sugar]]s are &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-chiral (right-handed).&lt;ref name="Lehninger"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nelson, Lehninger et al |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry |date=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homochirality'' can also refer to ''enantiomerically pure'' substances in which all the constituents are the same [[enantiomer]] (a right-handed or left-handed version of an atom or molecule), but some sources discourage this use of the term.

It is unclear whether homochirality has a purpose, however, it appears to be a form of information storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=James D.|title=A new definition of life|journal=Chirality|date=March 2009|volume=21|issue=3|pages=354–358|doi=10.1002/chir.20590|pmid=18571800}}&lt;/ref&gt; One suggestion is that it reduces [[entropy]] barriers in the formation of large organized molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Julian|first1=Ryan R.|last2=Myung|first2=Sunnie|last3=Clemmer|first3=David E.|title=Do Homochiral Aggregates Have an Entropic Advantage?|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=January 2005|volume=109|issue=1|pages=440–444|doi=10.1021/jp046478x|pmid=16851034}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been experimentally verified that amino acids form large aggregates in larger abundance from [[enantiopure]] substrates than from [[racemic]] ones.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

It is not clear whether homochirality emerged before or after life, and many mechanisms for its origin have been proposed.&lt;ref name=jafarpour2017 /&gt; Some of these models propose three distinct steps: ''mirror-symmetry breaking'' creates a minute enantiomeric imbalance, ''chiral amplification'' builds on this imbalance, and ''chiral transmission'' is the transfer of chirality from one set of molecules to another.

==In biology==

Amino acids are the building blocks of [[peptide]]s and [[enzyme]]s while sugar-peptide chains are the backbone of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reusch|first1=William|title=Peptides &amp; Proteins|url=https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/protein2.htm|website=Natural Products|publisher=Michigan State University|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lam|first1=Eric|chapter=Nucleic acids and proteins|editor-last1=Dey|editor-first1=P.M.|editor-last2=Harborne|editor-first2=J.B.|title=Plant Biochemistry.|date=1997|publisher=Elsevier|location=Burlington|isbn=9780080525723|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biological organisms, amino acids appear almost exclusively in the left-handed form (&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids) and sugars in the right-handed form (R-sugars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zubay |first1=Geoffrey |title=Origins of Life: On Earth and in the Cosmos |date=2000 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780080497617 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=August 2018}} Since the enzymes catalyze reactions, they enforce homochirality on a great variety of other chemicals, including [[hormone]]s, toxins, fragrances and food flavors.&lt;ref name=Seckbach&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seckbach|first1=edited by Joseph|title=Genesis - in the beginning : precursors of life, chemical models and early biological evolution|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9789400729407}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|493&amp;ndash;494}} [[Glycine]] is achiral, as are some other non-[[proteinogenic]] amino acids are either achiral (such as [[dimethylglycine]]) or of the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; enantiomeric form.

Biological organisms easily discriminate between molecules with different chiralities. This can affect physiological reactions such as smell and taste. [[Carvone]], a [[terpenoid]] found in [[essential oil]]s, smells like mint in its L-form and [[caraway]] in its R-form.&lt;ref name=Seckbach/&gt;{{rp|494}}{{verify source|date=August 2018}} [[Limonene]] tastes like lemons when right-handed and oranges when left-handed.&lt;ref name=Hazen&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hazen|first1=Robert M.|author-link=Robert Hazen|title=Genesis : the scientific quest for life's origins|date=2007|publisher=Joseph Henry|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780309103107}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|168}}

Homochirality also affects the response to drugs. [[Thalidomide]], in its left-handed form, cures [[morning sickness]]; in its right-handed form, it causes birth defects.&lt;ref name=Hazen/&gt;{{rp|168}} Unfortunately, even if a pure left-handed version is administered, some of it can convert to the right-handed form in the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Silas|title=Chiral Toxicology: It's the Same Thing... Only Different|issue=1|url=http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/110/1/4.full|journal=Toxicological Sciences|volume=110|accessdate=16 April 2016|pages=4–30|doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfp097|pmid=19414517|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many drugs are available as both a [[racemic mixture]] (equal amounts of both chiralities) and an [[enantiopure drug]] (only one chirality). Depending on the manufacturing process, enantiopure forms can be more expensive to produce than stereochemical mixtures.&lt;ref name=Hazen/&gt;{{rp|168}}

Chiral preferences can also be found at a macroscopic level. Snail shells can be right-turning or left-turning helices, but one  form or the other is strongly preferred in a given species. In the edible snail ''[[Helix pomatia]]'', only one out of 20,000 is left-helical.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meierhenrich|first1=Uwe|title=Amino acids and the asymmetry of life caught in the act of formation|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=9783540768869}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61&amp;ndash;62}} The coiling of plants can have a preferred chirality and even the chewing motion of cows has a 10% excess in one direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Andrew M.|title=Astrochemistry From Astronomy to Astrobiology.|date=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester|isbn=9780470091388|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
===Symmetry breaking===
Known mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the [[electroweak interaction]]; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] light, [[Quartz|quartz crystal]]s, or the Earth's rotation; and statistical fluctuations during racemic synthesis.&lt;ref name="Plasson2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plasson |first1=Raphaël |last2=Kondepudi |first2=Dilip K. |last3=Bersini |first3=Hugues |last4=Commeyras |first4=Auguste |last5=Asakura |first5=Kouichi |display-authors=3 |date=August 2007 |title=Emergence of homochirality in far-from-equilibrium systems: Mechanisms and role in prebiotic chemistry |journal=[[Chirality (journal)|Chirality]] |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=589–600 |doi=10.1002/chir.20440 |issn=0899-0042 |pmid=17559107}} "Special Issue: Proceedings from the Eighteenth International Symposium on Chirality (ISCD-18), Busan, Korea, 2006"&lt;/ref&gt; Once established, chirality would be selected for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart Clark (author) |date=July–August 1999 |title=Polarized Starlight and the Handedness of Life |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=87 |issue=4 |page=336 |bibcode=1999AmSci..87..336C |doi=10.1511/1999.4.336 |issn=0003-0996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small [[enantiomeric excess]] can be amplified into a large one by [[Autocatalysis#Asymmetric autocatalysis|asymmetric autocatalysis]], such as in the [[Soai reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shibata |first1=Takanori |last2=Morioka |first2=Hiroshi |last3=Hayase |first3=Tadakatsu |last4=Choji |first4=Kaori |last5=Soai |first5=Kenso |display-authors=3 |date=17 January 1996 |title=Highly Enantioselective Catalytic Asymmetric Automultiplication of Chiral Pyrimidyl Alcohol |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=118 |issue=2 |pages=471–472 |doi=10.1021/ja953066g |issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; In asymmetric autocatalysis, the catalyst is a chiral molecule, which means that a chiral molecule is catalysing its own production.

One supposition is that the discovery of an enantiomeric imbalance in molecules in the [[Murchison meteorite]] supports an extraterrestrial origin of homochirality: there is evidence for the existence of [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized light]] originating from [[Mie scattering]] on aligned interstellar dust particles which may trigger the formation of an [[enantiomeric excess]] within chiral material in space.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich/&gt;{{rp|123&amp;ndash;124}} Interstellar and near-stellar magnetic fields can align dust particles in this fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Helman |first=Daniel S |date=6 July 2018 |title=Galactic Distribution of Chirality Sources of Organic Molecules |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=151 |pages=595–602 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.07.008 |issn=0094-5765|bibcode=2018AcAau.151..595H |arxiv=1612.06720 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another speculation (the Vester-Ulbricht hypothesis) suggests that fundamental chirality of physical processes such as that of the beta decay (see [[Parity (physics)|Parity violation]]) leads to slightly different half-lives of biologically relevant molecules. Homochirality may also result from [[spontaneous absolute asymmetric synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guava.physics.uiuc.edu/~nigel/courses/569/Essays_Fall2006/files/Rajan.pdf|title=How did protein amino acids get left-handed while sugars got right-handed?|first=Aruna|last=Rajan|publisher=Term Paper for Physics 569*|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soai_interview&gt;{{cite journal | journal= Highlights in Chemical Science |year= 2008 |issue= 5 |url= http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2008/05/Kenso_Soai_interview.asp |title= Interview: In the beginning... |accessdate=June 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible that homochirality is simply a result of the natural autoamplification process of life—that either the formation of life as preferring one chirality or the other was a chance rare event which happened to occur with the chiralities we observe, or that all chiralities of life emerged rapidly but due to catastrophic events and strong competition, the other unobserved chiral preferences were wiped out by the preponderance and metabolic, enantiomeric enrichment from the 'winning' chirality choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ermann |first1=L |title=Homochirality: the key to unlocking the origin of life? |journal=Applied Theoretical Biology |date=2013 |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=21–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of chirality consensus as a natural autoamplification process has been associated with the [[2nd law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cause of chirality consensus | author= Jaakkola, S., Sharma, V. and Annila, A.| journal = Curr.

===Amplification===
====Theory====
[[File:Frank's model phase portrait.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Phase portrait of Frank's model: starting from almost everywhere in &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; plane (except &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; = &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; line), the system approaches to one of the homochiral states]]
In 1953, [[Frederick Charles Frank|Charles Frank]] proposed a model to demonstrate that homochirality is a consequence of [[autocatalysis]].&lt;ref name="frank1953"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=F.C. |year=1953 |title=On spontaneous asymmetric synthesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=11 |pages=459–463 |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(53)90082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his model the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; enantiomers of a chiral molecule are autocatalytically produced from an achiral molecule A

:A + &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; → 2&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;,{{pad}}A + &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; → 2&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;

while suppressing each other through a reaction that he called ''mutual antagonism''

:&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; → ∅.
In this model the racemic state is unstable in the sense that the slightest enantiomeric excess will be amplified to a completely homochiral state. This can be shown by computing the reaction rates from the [[law of mass action]]:
:&lt;math chem&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d[\ce L]}{dt}  &amp;= k_a [\ce L] - k_d \ce{[L] [D]}\\
\frac{d[\ce D]}{dt}  &amp;= k_a [\ce D] - k_d \ce{[L] [D]},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k_a&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for the autocatalytic reactions, &lt;math&gt;k_d&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for mutual antagonism reaction, and the concentration of A is kept constant for simplicity. By defining the enantiomeric excess &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math chem&gt;\Phi = \frac{[\ce D] - [\ce L]}{[\ce D] + [\ce L]},&lt;/math&gt;
we can compute the rate of change of enatiomeric excess using [[chain rule]] from the rate of change of the concentrations of enantiomeres &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;.
:&lt;math chem&gt;
\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = \left(\frac{2k_d \ce{[L] [D]}}{[\ce D] + [\ce L]}\right)\Phi.
&lt;/math&gt;
Linear stability analysis of this equation shows that the racemic state &lt;math&gt;\Phi = 0&lt;/math&gt; is unstable. Starting from [[almost everywhere]] in the concentration space, the system evolves to a homochiral state.

It is generally understood that autocatalysis alone does not yield to homochirality, and the presence of the mutually antagonistic relationship between the two enantiomers is necessary for the instability of the racemic mixture. However, recent studies show that homochirality could be achieved from autocatalysis in the absence of the mutually antagonistic relationship, but the underlying mechanism for symmetry-breaking is different.&lt;ref name="jafarpour2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2017 |title=Noise-induced symmetry breaking far from equilibrium and the emergence of biological homochirality |journal=Physical Review E |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=032407 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.95.032407|pmid=28415353 |bibcode=2017PhRvE..95c2407J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jafarpour2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2015 |title=Noise-induced mechanism for biological homochirality of early life self-replicators |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=115 |issue=15 |pages=158101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.158101|pmid=26550754 |arxiv=1507.00044 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115o8101J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Experiments====
There are several laboratory experiments that demonstrate how a small amount of one enantiomer at the start of a reaction can lead to a large excess of a single enantiomer as the product. For example, the Soai reaction is [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic]]. If the reaction is started with some of one of the product enantiomers already present, the product acts as an [[Enantioselective synthesis|enantioselective]] catalyst for production of more of that same enantiomer.&lt;ref name=shibata&gt;{{cite journal|title=Highly Enantioselective Catalytic Asymmetric Automultiplication of Chiral Pyrimidyl Alcohol|author1=Takanori Shibata |author2=Hiroshi Morioka |author3=Tadakatsu Hayase |author4=Kaori Choji |author5=Kenso Soai | journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | year=1996| volume= 118 | issue=2| pages=471–472 | doi=10.1021/ja953066g}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial presence of just 0.2 [[Equivalent (chemistry)|equivalent]] one enantiomer can lead to up to 93% [[enantiomeric excess]] of the product.

In this system, a small enantiomeric excess of catalyst leads to a large enantiomeric excess of product.

This finding may have consequences for the development of the [[Mars Organic Detector]] scheduled for launch in 2013 which aims to recover trace amounts of amino acids from the Mars surface exactly by a sublimation technique.

A high asymmetric amplification of the [[enantiomeric excess]] of sugars are also present in the [[amino acid]] catalyzed asymmetric formation of [[carbohydrates]]&lt;ref name=Engqvist&gt;{{cite journal| title=Plausible origins of homochirality in the amino acid catalyzed neogenesis of carbohydrates|author1=Armando Córdova |author2=Magnus Engqvist |author3=Ismail Ibrahem |author4=Jesús Casas |author5=Henrik Sundén | journal=[[Chem.

One classic study involves an experiment that takes place in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=kondepudi&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Sodium Chlorate Crystallization| author= Kondepudi, D. K., Kaufman, R. J. &amp; Singh, N.| journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 250 | pages = 975–976|year=1990|doi=10.1126/science.250.4983.975|pmid=17746924|issue=4983|bibcode = 1990Sci...250..975K }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[sodium chlorate]] is allowed to [[crystallization|crystallize]] from water and the collected crystals examined in a [[polarimeter]], each crystal turns out to be chiral and either the [[Levorotation|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;]] form or the [[Dextrorotation|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;]] form. In an ordinary experiment the amount of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; crystals collected equals the amount of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; crystals (corrected for statistical effects). However, when the sodium chlorate solution is stirred during the crystallization process the crystals are either exclusively &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; or exclusively &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;. In 32 consecutive crystallization experiments 14 experiments deliver &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-crystals and 18 others &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-crystals. The explanation for this symmetry breaking is unclear but is related to [[autocatalysis]] taking place in the [[nucleation]] process.

In a related experiment, a crystal suspension of a racemic [[amino acid]] derivative continuously stirred, results in a 100% crystal phase of one of the enantiomers because the enantiomeric pair is able to equilibrate in solution  (compare with [[dynamic kinetic resolution]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noorduin|first1=Wim L.|last2=Izumi|first2=Toshiko|last3=Millemaggi|first3=Alessia|last4=Leeman|first4=Michel|last5=Meekes|first5=Hugo|last6=Van Enckevort|first6=Willem J.

===Transmission===
Many strategies in [[asymmetric synthesis]] are built on chiral transmission. Especially important is the so-called [[organocatalysis]] of organic reactions by proline for example in [[Mannich reaction]]s.

==Optical resolution in racemic amino acids==
There exists no theory elucidating correlations among &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. If one takes, for example, [[alanine]], which has a small [[methyl]] group, and [[phenylalanine]], which has a larger [[benzyl]] group, a simple question is in what aspect, &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-alanine resembles &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine more than &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine, and what kind of mechanism causes the selection of all &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. Because it might be possible that alanine was &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and phenylalanine was &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;.

It was reported&lt;ref name=kojo&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Kojo |author2=H. Uchino |author3=M. Yoshimura |author4=K. Tanaka |title = Racemic D,L-asparagine causes enantiomeric excess of other coexisting racemic D,L-amino acids during recrystallization: a hypothesis accounting for the origin of L-amino acids in the biosphere.| journal = [[Chem. Comm.]] | pages= 2146–2147 | year= 2004|doi = 10.1039/b409941a|pmid=15467844|issue=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 that excess racemic [[asparagine|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-asparagine]] (Asn), which spontaneously forms crystals of either isomer during recrystallization, induces asymmetric resolution of a co-existing racemic amino acid such as [[arginine]] (Arg), [[aspartic acid]] (Asp), [[glutamine]] (Gln), [[histidine]] (His), [[leucine]] (Leu), [[methionine]] (Met), [[phenylalanine]] (Phe), [[serine]] (Ser), [[valine]] (Val), [[tyrosine]] (Tyr), and [[tryptophan]] (Trp). The [[enantiomeric excess]] {{math|ee {{=}} 100 &amp;times;(&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;)/(&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;+&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;)}} of these amino acids was correlated almost linearly with that of the inducer, i.e., Asn. When recrystallizations from a mixture of 12 &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids (Ala, Asp, Arg, Glu, Gln, His, Leu, Met, Ser, Val, Phe, and Tyr) and excess &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-Asn were made, all amino acids with the same configuration with Asn were preferentially co-crystallized.&lt;ref name=kojo/&gt; It was incidental whether the enrichment took place in &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;- or &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-Asn, however, once the selection was made, the co-existing amino acid with the same configuration at the α-carbon was preferentially involved because of thermodynamic stability in the crystal formation. The maximal ee was reported to be 100%. Based on these results, it is proposed that a mixture of racemic amino acids causes spontaneous and effective optical resolution, even if asymmetric synthesis of a single amino acid does not occur without an aid of an optically active molecule.

This is the first study elucidating reasonably the formation of chirality from racemic amino acids with experimental evidences.

==History of term==
This term was introduced by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] in 1904, the year that he published his Baltimore Lecture of 1884. Kelvin used the term homochirality as a relationship between two molecules, i.e. two molecule are homochiral if they have the same chirality.&lt;ref name=Engqvist/&gt;&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=David G.|title=Stereochemistry|date=2001|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-84755-194-8|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, however, homochiral has been used in the same sense as [[enantiomer]]ically pure. This is permitted in some journals (but not encouraged),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anslyn|first1=Eric V.|last2=Dougherty|first2=Dennis A.|title=Modern physical organic chemistry|date=2006|publisher=University Science Books|location=Sausalito, Calif.|isbn=9781891389313}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|342}}&lt;ref&gt;However, the message can be confusing. In {{cite journal|last1=Moss|first1=G. P.|title=Basic terminology of stereochemistry (IUPAC Recommendations 1996)|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|date=1 January 1996|volume=68|issue=12|pages=2193–2222|doi=10.1351/pac199668122193|url=https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/pac.1996.68.issue-12/pac199668122193/pac199668122193.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2018}}, the entry for ''Enantiomerically Pure/Enantiopure'' says "Use of homochiral as a synonym is strongly discouraged"; but the entry for ''Homochiral'' says "See ''enantiomerically pure/enantiopure''."&lt;/ref&gt; its meaning changing into the preference of a process or system for a single [[optical isomer]] in a pair of isomers in these journals.

==Career==

Pollmann began her career as an assistant professor first in Bielefeld (1990–91), then in [[University of Konstanz|Konstanz]] (1991–95), teaching Latin, and she spent some time on postdoctoral studies at [[University College London]], funded by the [[Alexander von Humboldt]] Stipend (1993–95). In 1994, she finished her [[Habilitation]] at Konstanz, and she moved to the [[University of St Andrews]] to take up a post as a lecturer in Classics (1995–2000). In 2000, she was promoted to the rank of professor.&lt;ref name="st-andrews.ac.uk"&gt;https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/karla-friedel-lore-pollmann(22802a2e-0f77-4da5-8a19-d75fa682996e).html&lt;/ref&gt; Pollmann is a visiting professor at many institutions, including the [[University of Vienna]], the [[University of British Columbia]] (Green College), [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College Oxford]], the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study, and the University of Århus, where she has been made an adjunct professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tf.uio.no/english/research/networks/ec/newsletters/june2008.html|title=Newsletter No. 12, June 2008 - The Faculty of Theology|author=|date=|website=www.tf.uio.no|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was elected professor extraordinary at Stellenbosch University for 2011-2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/classics/news/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 she founded the Centre for Early Christianity and its Reception at the [[University of Kent]], and was director of the school between 2014 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reading.ac.uk/classics/about/staff/k-f-l-pollmann.aspx|title=Karla Pollmann, University of Reading|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is head of the School of Humanities at the University of Reading.

Pollmann is a college peer review member of the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] and has served on various of its panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/About/Publications/Documents/annualreport201011.pdf|title=404 - Arts and Humanities Research Council|author=|date=|website=www.ahrc.ac.uk|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is on the editorial or advisory board of several journals and encyclopedias, including ''Societies'', ''Oxford Journal of Reception Studies'', ''Millennium'', ''Journal of Ancient Christianity'', ''Lexikon der Bibelhermeneutik'', ''Augustiniana'', ''Hypomnemata'', and ''Thoemmes Dictionary of British Classicists: 1500-1960'',&lt;ref&gt;https://risweb.st-andrews.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/karla-friedel-lore-pollmann(22802a2e-0f77-4da5-8a19-d75fa682996e)/activities.html&lt;/ref&gt; and is editor-in-chief of the international and interdisciplinary ''Oxford Guide to the Historical Reception of Augustine''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/Philosophy/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780199299164#Description&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interests==

Pollmann works on ancient texts of Antiquity ranging from [[Homer]] to the early Christian writers. She is particularly interested in the interface between Classics and [[Theology]], especially the reception of Classical thought and literature in Christian writers and the amalgamation and transformation of ideas from Classical and Late Antiquity. More recently she has become interested in the reception of early Christian thought in later times, and this interest led to her directing an international and interdisciplinary project funded by the [[Leverhulme Trust]] on the reception of Augustine of Hippo from his death in 430 to 2000.&lt;ref name="st-andrews.ac.uk"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5316">[[File:Orestes 338-44 WDL4309.png|thumb|Musical fragment from the first stasimon of ''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]'' by Euripides (lines 338-344, Vienna Papyrus G 2315)]]
'''Katolophyromai''' ({{lang-el|κατολοφύρομαι}}), is the headword in a musical fragment from the first [[stasimon]] of ''[[Orestes (play)|Orestes]]'' by [[Euripides]] (lines 338-344, Vienna Papyrus G 2315). It means "I cry, lament so much." In 1892, among a number of papyri from [[Hermopolis]], Egypt, in the collection of [[Archduke Rainer Ferdinand of Austria]], a fragment was discovered and published&lt;ref&gt;Mitteilungen aus der Sammlung der Papyrus Erzherzog Rainer vol. 5 part 3&lt;/ref&gt; by the papyrologist [[Karl Wessely]], containing a mutilated passage with [[musical notation]]. Although Vienna Papyrus G 2315 dates to the third century B.C., the melody recorded on it may have been written much earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Mathiesen (1999) places it about 125 years after the death of Euripides. Cambridge University Press (1928) in the Augustan age.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
The full text of the musical fragment reads as follows:

:[I cry, I cry, your mother’s blood that drives you mad, great happiness in mortals never lasting, but like a sail of a swift ship, which a god shook up and plunged it with terrible troubles into the greedy and deadly waves of sea.]}}

The arrangement of the fragmentary text differs from the traditional editions, in which the lines begin with {{lang|grc|ματέρος αἷμα}} (mother’s blood) and {{lang|grc|κατολοφύρομαι}} appears after {{lang|grc|βροτοῖς}} (mortals). Unlike other fragments, however, the text and musical notations are quite well preserved.

==Poetic features==
The [[Meter (poetry)|rhythm]] of the song is [[catalectic]] [[trochaic tetrameter]] and the ''tónos'' or ''trópos'' is [[Lydian mode|Lydian]]. The preserved vocal notes coincide with the Ancient Doric or Phrygian ''harmonia'' transmitted by [[Aristides Quintilianus]],&lt;ref&gt;Aristides Quintilianus. ''On Music'' 1.18 and 2.80. https://books.google.com/books?id=8xS_ky1OhqAC&amp;pg=PA392&amp;lpg=PA392&amp;dq=Aristides+Quintilianus+On+Music&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wx0nTNxSRn&amp;sig=os9mEJO5UimjIGM7Qx4oMhaiiwM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihv6zJ5eXRAhXs24MKHfhhCoYQ6AEISDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Aristides%20Quintilianus%20On%20Music&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; the Damon ''harmoniai'', in [[enharmonic genus]], which was usual in tragedy of fifth century BC.

==Authorship==
Whether this fragment represents the original music Euripides composed in 408 BC is an open question, given also the absence of 5th century BC musical inscriptions. Nevertheless, there is some evidence in favour of the authenticity. [[Psellus]] and [[Plutarch]] credit Euripides and [[Agathon]] with the introduction of chromatic genus and the fragment accords with it but also with observations of [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] and [[Aristophanes]] about the complexity of Euripidean style, which appear in the source: alteration of textual rhythm, reduplication of syllables and chromatic or disjunct musical lines. If the Hellenistic and Roman era musicians and musicologists imitated and reproduced the Classical works the same way librarians, grammarians, [[Atticist]]s did for literature, this would be another argument or point of further discussion.

'''Levedi''', or '''Levedias''', '''Lebedias''', and '''Lebedi'''{{citation needed|date = July 2015}} was the first known [[voivode]] of the [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]].&lt;ref&gt;Gyula Moravcsik, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3al15wpFWiMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Constantine+Porphyrogenitus+de+Administrando+Imperio&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eFOqUeu0M8qT0AXygoH4DQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA Constantine Porphyrogenitus de Administrando Imperio], Dumbarton Oaks Center for Byzantine Studies, 1967, p 171&lt;/ref&gt; Levedi's wife was a [[Khazar]] princess, and he was close to the Khazar ruling dynasty. He may himself have been part Khazar. According to [[Constantine VII|Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus']] ''[[De administrando imperio]]'', the Khazars sought to make Levedi the paramount ruler of all the Hungarian tribes, but he refused, possibly because he was childless or because his close ties to the Khazar government were resented by other Magyar leaders. Instead, Levedi proposed [[Álmos]] and his son [[Árpád]] as leaders of the Magyars. The [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] settlement between the [[Volga]] river and the [[Urals]] the mountains were named ''Lebedia'' soon to become ''[[Levedia]]'' after Levedi.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grozerarchery.com/magyar.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name and title ==

The only source of Levedi's life is the ''[[De administrando imperio]]'',{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=112}} a book written by the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] around 950.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=8}} According to historian [[Omeljan Pritsak]], Levedi's name, which was actually a title, derived from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] expression ''"alp edi"'', or "brave lord".{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=112}} The Hungarian historian [[Gyula Kristó]], who refuses Pritsak's theory, says that Levedi's name is connected to the Hungarian verb ''"lesz"'' ("be").{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=112}} A similar proper name (Lewedi) was recorded in a Hungarian charter, issued in 1138.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=112}}

When writing about Levedi, Porphyrogenitus emphasized "the illustriousness of his race".&lt;ref&gt;''Constantine Porphyrogenitus: De Administrando Imperio'' (ch. 38), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=9}} Porphyrogenitus's narration suggests that Levedi was born between around 800 and 815, because he seems to have been older than [[Álmos]] who was born in the 820s.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=114}} Levedi bore the title "[[voivode]]", which is of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=115}} When using that title, Porphyrogenitus always referred to the heads of the seven Magyar tribes.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=114}} Historian Dezső Paizs says that Levedi was the head of the Megyer tribe, but his theory has not been widely accepted.{{sfn|Kristó|1996|p=9}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40570">This article lists notable '''industrial disasters''', which are [[disasters]] caused by [[industry|industrial]] companies, either by accident, [[negligence]] or incompetence. They are a form of industrial [[Work accident|accident]] where great damage, injury or loss of life are caused.

Other disasters can also be considered industrial disasters, if their causes are rooted in the products or processes of industry. For example, the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871 was made more severe due to the heavy concentration of lumber industry facilities, wood houses, and fuel and other chemicals in a small area.

The [[Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents]] is designed to protect people and the environment from industrial accidents. The Convention aims to prevent accidents from occurring, to reduce their frequency and severity, and to mitigate their effects. The Convention addresses primarily industrial accidents in one country that affect the population and the environment of another country.

==Defense industry==
* '''December 6, 1917:''' [[Halifax, Canada]]. The [[Halifax Explosion]]. A ship loaded with about 9,000 tons of high explosives destined for France caught fire as a result of a collision in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] harbour, and exploded. The explosion killed about 2,000 and injured about 9,000.
* '''October 4, 1918:''' [[T. A. Gillespie Company Shell Loading Plant explosion]]. An ammunition plant in [[Sayreville, New Jersey]] exploded, killing approximately 100 people, destroying 300 buildings and causing $18 million in damages.
*'''March 1, 1924:''' [[1924 Nixon Nitration Works disaster]]. A plant for processing ammonium nitrate in [[Edison, New Jersey]] exploded, killing 24 people, injuring 100 and destroying several buildings.
* '''July 17, 1944:''' [[Port Chicago disaster|Port Chicago Disaster]]. A munitions explosion that killed 320 people occurred at the [[Port Chicago Naval Magazine]] in [[Port Chicago, California]].

* '''August 9, 1965:''' [[Little Rock AFB]] in [[Searcy, Arkansas|Searcy]], Arkansas.  53 contract workers were killed during a fire at a [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] [[missile silo]].  The cause of the fire was determined to be a welding rod damaging a hydraulic hose. This allowed hydraulic vapors to leak and spread throughout the silo, which were then ignited by an open flame.
* '''April 13, 1976:''' [[Lapua Cartridge Factory explosion]]. An explosion in a munitions factory in [[Lapua]], [[Finland]] kills 40 workers.
* '''April 10, 1988:''' [[Ojhri Camp]]. A military storage center in Rawalpindi, Pakistan exploded, killing more than 90 people.

* '''October 1957:''' The [[Windscale fire]], the worst nuclear accident in Great Britain's history, released substantial amounts of radioactive contamination into the surrounding area at Windscale, Cumberland (now Sellafield, Cumbria).
* '''May 1962:''' The [[Centralia, Pennsylvania]] coal mine fire began, forcing the gradual evacuation of the Centralia borough. The fire continues to burn in the abandoned borough.
* '''March 4, 1965''' The Natchitoches explosion: A 32-inch gas transmission pipeline, north of [[Natchitoches, Louisiana]], belonging to the Tennessee Gas Pipeline exploded and burned from stress corrosion cracking on March 4, killing 17 people. At least 9 others were injured, and 7 homes 450 feet from the rupture were destroyed. The same pipeline had also had an explosion on May 9, 1955, just 930 feet (280 m) from the 1965 failure.
* '''March 1967:''' The {{SS|Torrey Canyon||2}} [[Oil tanker|supertanker]] was shipwrecked off the west coast of Cornwall, England, causing an environmental disaster. This was the first major [[oil spill]] at sea.
* '''August 1975:''' The [[Banqiao Dam]] failed in the Henan Province of China due to extraordinarily heavy precipitation from the remnants of [[Typhoon Nina (1975)|Typhoon Nina]] and poor construction quality of the dam, which was built during the [[Great Leap Forward]]. The flood immediately killed over 100,000 people, and another 150,000 died of subsequent epidemic diseases and famine, bringing the total death toll to around 250,000 and making it the worst technical disaster ever.
* '''March 16, 1978:''' The ''[[Amoco Cadiz]]'', a [[Oil tanker|VLCC]] owned by the company Amoco (now merged with BP) sank near the northwest coast of France, resulting in the spilling of 68,684,000 US gallons of crude oil (1,635,000 barrels).

'''Matija Mesić''' ([[Brod na Savi]], February 19, 1826 - [[Zagreb]], December 5, 1878) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] historian, university professor, the first rector of the [[University of Zagreb]].

He graduated [[philosophy]] at the Royal Academy of Science in 1844, and [[theology]] at the [[Vienna]] [[Pázmáneum]] in 1848. After being ordained and a short chapel service, he worked as a probationary professor of history and geography at the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Zagreb. In the period 1851-1853 he studied history and geography in Vienna and [[Prague]]. He received a professorship at the Law Academy in Zagreb in 1854, working as a director of the same institution since 1871.

He participated in the work of [[Croatian parliament]] and served as the president of [[Matica ilirska]]. He was a full member of the [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] since 1867. In 1874 he was selected as a full professor of [[History of Croatia|Croatian history]] at the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Zagreb|Faculty of Philosophy]].

In the academic year 1874/75 he had the honor to be the first rector of the Royal University of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] in Zagreb. In the opening ceremony, on the October 19th 1874, he held his famous speech in which he warned on the importance of modern university.

In his works he systematically and critically dealt with the period of Croatian history of late [[Middle Ages]] in the period of [[Jagiellon dynasty]]. A street on [[Šalata]] in Zagreb bears his name since 1928.

The '''Middelaldercentret''' ({{Lang-en|The Medieval Centre}}) is an experimental [[living history]] museum in [[Denmark]], which depicts the [[middle ages]] in the Denmark of the late 14th and early 15th centuries. It is located in [[Sundby (Lolland)|Sundby Lolland]], some 4&amp;nbsp;km northwest of the centre of [[Nykøbing Falster]] on the waterfront of [[Guldborgsund]].

It features a town built as part of a typical Danish [[market town]] with craftsmen, a [[harbour]] with ships and boats, and a market place. The employees are dressed in period costumes and live and work in the houses and do everyday activities such as craftmanship, cooking and weapon training. Furthermore, the museum has a variety of siege weapons of the period, such as [[trebuchet]]s, a [[ballista]] and a [[cannon]] and smaller weapons such as [[Arquebus|handguns]], [[longbow]]s and [[crossbow]]s. All of the items are built on site using period tools. Activities include live firing of the weapons daily, [[archery]], [[jousting|knightly tournaments]], and demonstrations of crafts and tasks from the [[Middle Ages|late 14th century]] and early 15th centuries.

The employees are both permanent staff and unemployed people sent in job training from the [[Guldborgsund Municipality|municipality]]. In addition, a support association exists, from which a large group of volunteers participates in the daily work. All the involved people "live in the medieval period", which means that they do not know of modern things like [[television]], [[cellphone]]s and so on. The former [[curator]] of the centre was the [[historian]], [[writer]] and [[lecturer]] [[Kåre Johannessen]]. By 2016, the curator was Thit Birk Petersen.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.middelaldercentret.dk/en/about-us | title = About Us | accessdate = 2015-05-29 | publisher = Middelaldercentret}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides normal museum activities, the Middle Ages Centre does extensive research within the middle ages and different medieval technologies, and the museum has reconstructed weapons, ships, clothing and [[diving equipment]] among others. The museum has a reputation of being the most authentic place in [[Europe]] within the medieval period.&lt;ref name='kes.org'&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.kes.org.uk/living-history.html | title = Living History | accessdate = 2013-09-17 | publisher = [[King Edward's School, Birmingham|King Edwards School]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the authenticity the medieval town has been used as a setting for many movies, documentaries and TV-series.

[[File:Jousting at Middelaldercentret2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[jousting]] at the museum.]]
The Middle Ages Centre started with the reconstruction of a medieval [[siege weapon]], called a [[trebuchet]], built to mark the 700th anniversary of Nykøbing Falster in 1989. The local museum reconstructed the trebuchet and the experiment ran for three weeks in which 15000&lt;ref name='Historie'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.middelaldercentret.dk/Ommiddelaldercentret/lidthistorie.html | title = Lidt historie | accessdate = 2013-01-30 | publisher = www.Middelaldercentret.dk | language = Danish | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121115082148/http://www.middelaldercentret.dk/Ommiddelaldercentret/lidthistorie.html | archivedate = 2012-11-15 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;-30000&lt;ref name='Jagt'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://politiken.dk/incoming/ECE214732/jagt-paa-krudt-til-perfekte-vaaben/ | title = Jagt på krudt til perfekte våben | accessdate = 2013-01-30 | last = Schmidt | first = Anders Legarth | date = 2006-01-26 | work = [[Politiken]] | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; people visited the site. Given the considerable  interest in the trebuchet, a scoping project, "Medieval Technology Centre", was conducted for two months in the summer of 1991. The project consisted of a series of workshops and a kitchen tent set up around the trebuchet. As a private institution, The Middle Ages Centre was founded in 1992. Two years later, in 1994, a donation from Arbejdsmarkedets Feriefond (a [[Foundation (non-profit)|non-profit foundation]]) made it possible to build an entire settlement with houses, tournament lists, a harbour, and a new entrance building.&lt;ref name='Historie'/&gt;&lt;ref name='archive_archaeology'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://archive.archaeology.org/online/interviews/vemming/index.html | title = Reconstructing Medieval Artillery | accessdate = 2013-01-30 | date = June 14, 2005 | publisher = http://archive.archaeology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, more houses have been built and one major new project is carried out each year.

== Concept ==
Living history is central to The Middle Ages Centre and the focus is a Danish market town in the period around the year 1400. The centre follows the current calendar, but offset by 610 years - 2014 the year 1404 is depicted and so on.

The Centre's work is based on very thorough research. The purpose of the work is partly dissemination, but also academic research, especially in the form of so-called [[experimental archaeology]] where ancient tools and technology is reconstructed on the basis of extant sources and objects in exhibitions around the world, and then tested in practice.

Staff and volunteers dress in period costume, and live in the opening hours just as they would have 610 years ago. Both volunteers and employees are thoroughly trained so as to make sure that they are professionally equipped to assume the role of medieval people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://middelaldercentret.dk/Engelsk/volounteers.html | title = Becoming volunteer at the Medieval Centre | accessdate = 2013-01-30 | publisher = Middelaldercentret.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://guldborgsundgildet.dk/ViewSubPage.aspx?id=4 | title = Frivillig på feltet | accessdate = 2013-03-07 | publisher = Guldborgsundgildet.dk | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither [[glasses]] nor [[piercing]]s are allowed and the inhabitants don't know about mobile phones, TV or other modern things, as these are not a part of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://middelaldercentret.dk/Ommiddelaldercentret/formidlingen.html | title = En særlig formidlingsform: Vi er i Det Herrens År ... | accessdate = 2013-01-30 | publisher = Middelaldercentret.dk | language = Danish | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121116153637/http://www.middelaldercentret.dk/Ommiddelaldercentret/formidlingen.html | archivedate = 2012-11-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Volunteers are co-ordinated by the Guldborgsund Guild (Guldborgsund Gildet).&lt;ref&gt;[http://guldborgsundgildet.dk/ViewContentPage.aspx?id=1 Guldborgsund Gildet]. Official Website of the Volunteer community&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum has a restaurant called ''The Golden Swann'', which is furnished as a dining hall at a major Danish castle around 1400. It serves authentic medieval food by candlelight. The restaurant is independent but meets the same requirements regarding authenticity as the rest of the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://middelaldercentret.dk/Engelsk/placestoeat.html | title = Are you in need of a refreshment | accessdate = 2013-01-30 | publisher = Middelaldercentret.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre was the first in the world to reconstruct an actual working trebuchet in 1989.&lt;ref name='archive_archaeology'/&gt; Since then the centre has been hired to help build the [[Warwick Castle#The Warwick trebuchet|trebuchet]] at [[Warwick Castle]], [[Warwickshire]], [[England]] which is the largest functioning trebuchet in the world.&lt;ref name='archive_archaeology'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.warwicksiege.com/warwick_trebuchet.asp | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060221034628/http://www.warwicksiege.com/warwick_trebuchet.asp | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2006-02-21 | title = The Warwick Trebuchet | accessdate = 2013-01-30 | publisher = warwicksiege.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[Moesgård Museum]] the museum has reconstructed the world's oldest cannon cast in [[bronze]].&lt;ref name='Jagt'/&gt;

The centre participated in [[Galathea expeditions|the third Galathea expedition]] (2006-2007) and researched both [[sulfur]] and [[Nitratine|saltpeter]] in [[black powder]] production in [[Puducherry]], [[India]] and transportation to [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://middelaldercentret.dk/Engelsk/aboutthecentre.html | title = About the centre | accessdate = 2013-01-30 | publisher = Middelaldercentret.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, research regarding textiles, winter habitation, and the manufacture of medieval war machinery has been carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://middelaldercentret.dk/Engelsk/projects.html | title = Research and projects | accessdate = 2013-01-30 | publisher = Middelaldercentret.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval [[Historical reenactment|reenactment]] groups from around the world visit the centre during the season. Since 2010, there has been held a week-long festival during the summer holidays, where international reenactment groups have been invited. During these specific festivals, the time period and region of interest being portrayed been extended to embrace broader medieval life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.middelaldercentret.dk/events/ridderfestival.html

'''Multilineal evolution''' is a  20th-century [[social theory]] about the [[evolution of societies]] and [[culture]]s. It is composed of many competing theories by various sociologists and anthropologists. This theory has replaced the older 19th century set of theories of [[unilineal evolution]].

When critique of classical social evolutionism became widely accepted, modern anthropological and sociological approaches have changed to reflect their responses to the critique of their predecessor. Modern theories are careful to avoid unsourced, ethnocentric speculation, comparisons, or value judgements; more or less regarding individual societies as existing within their own historical contexts. These conditions provided the context for new theories such as [[cultural relativism]] and multilineal evolution.

By the 1940s cultural anthropologists such as [[Leslie White]] and [[Julian Steward]] sought to revive an evolutionary model on a more scientific basis, and succeeded in establishing an approach known as the [[neoevolutionism]]. White rejected the opposition between "primitive" and "modern" societies but did argue that societies could be distinguished based on the amount of energy they harnessed, and that increased energy allowed for greater social differentiation. Steward on the other hand rejected the 19th century notion of progress, and instead called attention to the Darwinian notion of "adaptation", arguing that all societies had to adapt to their environment in some way.

The anthropologists [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[Elman Service]] wrote a book, ''Evolution and Culture'', in which they attempted to synthesize White's and Steward's approaches. Other anthropologists, building on or responding to work by White and Steward, developed theories of cultural ecology and ecological anthropology. The most prominent examples are [[Peter Vayda]] and [[Roy Rappaport]]. By the late 1950s, students of Steward such as [[Eric Wolf]] and [[Sidney Mintz]] turned away from cultural ecology to [[Marxism]], [[World Systems Theory]], [[Dependency theory]] and [[Marvin Harris]]'s [[Cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]].

Today most anthropologists continue to reject 19th century notions of progress and the three original assumptions of unilineal evolution. Following Steward, they take seriously the relationship between a culture and its environment in attempts to explain different aspects of a culture. But most modern cultural anthropologists have adopted a general systems approach, examining cultures as emergent systems and argue that one must consider the whole social environment, which includes political and economic relations among cultures. There are still others who continue to reject the entirety of the evolutionary thinking and look instead at historical contingencies, contacts with other cultures, and the operation of cultural symbol systems. As a result, the simplistic notion of 'cultural evolution' has grown less useful and given way to an entire series of more nuanced approaches to the relationship of culture and environment. In the area of development studies, authors such as [[Amartya Sen]] have developed an understanding of 'development' and 'human flourishing' that also question more simplistic notions of progress, while retaining much of their original inspiration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18742">'''Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún''' (often abbreviated as '''Òkè-Ìlá''') is an ancient city in southwestern Nigeria that was capital of the ancient [[Igbomina]]-[[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] city-state of the same name.

Òkè-Ìlá is a city in [[Osun State|Ọs&amp;#x323;un State]], [[Nigeria]]. It is situated in the northeastern part of [[Yorubaland]] in southwestern Nigeria. Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún’s sister city (and sister kingdom) [[Ila, Nigeria|Ìlá Òràngún]] is located about {{convert|12|km|mi|frac=2}} to the northeast, separated by the north-trending ridges and gorges of the Oke-Ila Quartzites.

Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún is currently capital of [[Ifedayo|Ifedayo Local Government Area]]  of [[Osun State|Ọsun State]]. The Ifedayo LGA (Local Government Area) Secretariat is located on the northern outskirts of the town. The administration of the two major towns and the several smaller towns and villages is conducted from the Ifedayo LGA Secretariat.

==Location==
Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún is located at {{coord|7.955|N|4.986|E|region:NG_type:city(35000)|display=inline,title}}, at an elevation of {{convert|1863|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} on one of the several mountains adjoining the eastern flanks of the [[Oke-Ila Ridge]], a part of the [[Yoruba Hills]].  Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún is about {{convert|190|km}} directly west of the [[Confluence (geography)|confluence]] of the Rivers [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Benue River|Benue]] at [[Lokoja]] and about {{convert|45|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Osogbo]] the capital of [[Osun State]]. It is about {{convert|240|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Lagos]] with [[Ibadan]] at about midway between. It is about {{convert|160|km|abbr=on|-1}} southeast of the ancient city of Oyo (Oyo-Ile or [[Old Oyo]]) and about {{convert|130|km|abbr=on}} east of modern [[Oyo, Nigeria|Oyo]] (Ago d'Oyo).

==Ila-Yara: ancient history ==

===Original unified city-state at Ila-Yara ===
Before a dispute and split several centuries ago, the present Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún and [[Ila, Nigeria|Ìlá Òràngún]] constituted the original united kingdom centered on [[Ila-Yara|Ìlá-Yàrà]], a city-state founded, according to legend, by [[Oduduwa]]'s fourth son (according to legend), named Fagbamila and nicknamed [[Orangun|Òràngún]].

The dispute, said to be a succession dispute in one account, or a relocation site dispute by another account, centered on two brother-princes (Àpàkíìmò and Arútú Olúòkun) and their supporters, and led to  a split of the Ila-Yara city-state and the eventual emigration of both factions from the Ila-Yara site.

===Factional histories since Ila-Yara===
Oral history of Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún kingdom claims, that the dispute arose from the selection of a new site to move the kingdom to. Unfortunately, the [[Ifá|Ifa]] oracle acknowledged as suitable both soil samples from the site selected by the Ìlá-Yàrà kingdom's official delegates commissioned by Prince Àpàkíìmò, as well as the site selected by the unofficial delegates commissioned by the kingdom's youth led by Àpàkíìmò's brother, Prince Arútú Olúòkun.

The kingdom's royal council insisted on the site selected by the kingdom's official delegates while the young people argued the advantages of the site selected by the delegates they commissioned. The younger prince, Arútú Olúòkun's faction led a migration of his faction out of Ìlá-Yàrà and founded [[Ìlá-Magbon]]. Thereafter, (according to oral history of Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún kingdom), the official Ìlá-Yàrà kingdom under the "de jure" Òràngún Àpàkíìmò, migrated to their preferred site. The faction of the prince, Àpàkíìmò at Ìlá-Yàrà, founded Igbóhùn, is the modern Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún.

Oral history states that when earthworm pests subsequently bothered Prince Arútú faction's settlement at [[Ila-Magbon]], Prince Arútú Olúòkun elected to "sink into the ground", because he was no longer able to travel when told by the Ifa oracle that they had to move to the [[Ila-Odo]] site which is the location of the modern [[Ila, Nigeria|Ìlá Òràngún]], where the "Òrèrè" staff was first stuck into the ground. Oral history of Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún kingdom also claims, that Òfínní, an Òràngún deposed from the Òràngún Àpàkíìmò;'s kingdom at Igbóhùn was the first Òràngún officially installed by the youth's faction after their exit from Ìlá-Yàra

==Migrations==

===Relocations===
Since the migration from Ìlá-Yàrà, the Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún kingdom had settled at various locations, the most notable being [[Igbohun]] (the original name and site of the city-state), [[Okiri]], [[Iladun]], [[Omi-Osun ruins|Omi-Ọsun]] (along the [[Omi Osun|Omi-Ọsun]] river, a source of the [[Osun River]]), and the present site (Oke-Ila), which oral history claims is partly superimposed on, and contiguous with, the original Igbohun site, and reputedly has twice been previously occupied and abandoned.

===Refugee settlements===
The [[original]] population of the Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún kingdom has over the centuries been joined by waves of [[human migration|migrations]] from other parts of Yorubaland, as well as [[refugees]] of various conflicts in the near and distant parts of [[Igbomina]]land. An example of additions to the original population are the [[Obalumo|Ọba'lúmọ̀]] of [[Isedo, Nigeria|Ìsèdó]] group who were also of the earlier  [[Oba, Nigeria|Òbà]] diaspora.

Oral history gives examples of historical refugees that were hosted by the Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún kingdom in separate [[Quarter (country subdivision)|quarters]] or [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]], but have subsequently returned to their [[homeland]]s, such as the [[Rore, Nigeria|Rore]] (or Irore), the [[Arandun]] and the [[Ora-Igbomina]] kingdoms.&lt;ref name="Babalola, Olufemi Oladapo 1984"&gt;Babalola, Olufemi Oladapo. “The Obaala Babalola Adekeye's History of Oke-Ila Orangun - Historical and Constitutional Development of The Ìgbómìnà-Yorùbá Kingdom of Oke-Ila Orangun from its Foundation to [[British people|British]] Imperio-Colonialism”. ''Butubutu Publishers''. [[Austin, Texas]]. August 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is conceivable that the Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún kingdom itself had similarly been temporary guests as war-refugees of their neighbour-kingdoms, just like their sister-kingdom Ìlá Òràngún was for 15 years a refugee-kingdom at [[Omupo]] during the 19th century wars with the [[Ibadan]] empire, in which Oke-Ila and other [[Igbomina]] kingdoms were part of the "Ekiti Parapo" alliance with the [[Ijesha]], fighting off the "tyranny" of Ibadan's "ajele" system of [[tribute]]-tax apportionment and collection.

===Wars and slave raids===
Both  he domestic/internal [[African Slave Trade]] and the "export" oriented [[Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade]] adversely impacted the Oke-Ila Orangun Kingdom. Although various  Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún oral-historians claim (like most Yoruba cities and kingdom) never to have been [[wikt:vanquish|vanquish]]ed or captured for [[enslavement]], [[wikt:snippet|snippet]]s of clan-histories and kingdom-histories reveal that the Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún kingdom was bothered for a significant part of its history by slave-raids and attacks from its [[neighbours]].&lt;ref name="Babalola, Olufemi Oladapo 1984" /&gt; During the reign of one of her kings, the Orangun himself was a "king-in-[[exile]]" and a "[[refugee]]" for 40 years in the Oro kingdom (now in [[Kwara State]]) - a complex of nine consolidated settlements several kilometres northwest of his Oke-Ila Orangun kingdom. The return of this Orangun to the Omi-Osun area near the devastated old capital, gave him the nickname "Ayunrobo" - one who went to Oro and made it back.

===Immigrants profile===
The newer waves of migrations that stayed on in Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún can usually be identified from their traditional orature [[Verse (poetry)|verses]] which usually make [[nostalgic]] references to their original homeland. Apart from the Isedo quarter/ward of Oke-Ila, the Iranyin quarter/ward is also an identifiable immigrant group that consolidated with the Oke-Ila Orangun kingdom. It is not yet ascertained if the Alapinni quarter of Oke-Ila Orangun are secondary immigrants from [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] or direct immigrants from the then adjoining [[Bida Emirate|Nupe]] territories as were the Alapinni clan of the old Oyo Empire. The Aworo clan is said by oral-historians to be from Ekiti while orature citation of parts of the clan make references to Oyo as origin. The relationship of the Elemona clan to the Yoruba kingdom of Ilemona (west of Oke-Ila), is yet speculative until corroborated from their clan orature-verses. Similarly is the possible connection of the Obajoko title of the Iranyin clan to the Yoruba kingdom of Iranyin west of Oke-Ila.

==The place, the people and the culture ==

===Population and culture===

Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún has a population estimated (2005) to be 35,000 (suspected to be an under-estimation).

The people of Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún kingdom speak a distinctive dialect of the [[Yoruba language]] called [[Igbomina]] (or Ogbonna). The people are mostly agrarian but have a significant number of artisans, traders, hunters of wild game, school-teachers and other professionals.

Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún is famous for the energetic dancing and acrobatic skills of its [[Elewe]], the region's primary [[Egungun]], a dancing masquerade ensemble representing the ancestors during various traditional festivals. The Egungun Elewe is unique to the Igbomina Yoruba subgroup. There are other less popular but unique and peculiar Egungun in the kingdom.

===Natural sites===
Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún is notable for the adventurous and breathtaking [[Ayikunugba Waterfalls]] (also spelt Ayikunnugba Waterfalls) situated in a cliffed gorge, and its associated caves with "mythical" underground passages. The Ayikunugba (or Ayikunnugba) Waterfalls is located southwest of the town, along the north trending ridge-and-gorge series of the [[Oke-Ila Ridge]] complex. Another tourist site is the [[Oke Lanfo]] Peak located southeast of Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún, from the top of which a panoramic view of the surrounding towns within 50 kilometers can be seen. The ridges and gorges consist of the geologically defined [[Oke-Ila Quartzites]], a series of metamorphic rocks of [[Pan-African age]] ( about 550 million years old).n

== Orangun, the Paramount King - from Nigerian independence to present day==

===Orangun Samuel Adeyemi, Arojojoye III ===
From Nigeria's independent take-off at the end of her colonial era under the British, Oba Samuel Adeyemi, Arojojoye reigned as Orangun, the [[Paramount leader|Paramount]] King of Oke-Ila from 1969 until he "joined the [[ancestors]]" in November 2005. This ancient and historic Yoruba kingdom recorded several "firsts" during Orangun Adeyemi's reign, among which are the tarring of the link-road joining the city to the inter-state road at Asanlu junction, the inauguration of the premier community-sponsored secondary school -the Oke-Ila Grammar School (an alumnus of which rose to become in 2007 a full professor), the establishment of pipe-borne water supply, the electrification of the city, the designation of the city as capital of the new local government, and the construction of the local government headquarters in the city. Orangun Samuel Adeyemi led the kingdom of Oke-Ila Orangun into the third [[millennium]] before he joined his ancestors.

===Orangun Adedokun Abolarin, Aroyinkeye I===
Soon after the turn of the millennium, the current [[Orangun]] of Oke-Ila Orangun in Ifedayo Local Government area of Osun State, Oba Adedokun Abolarin was installed on December 8, 2006. Oba Adedokun Abolarin is from the Obasolo Ruling House, one of the three ruling houses among which the title rotates in Oke-Ila Orangun.

The new Òràngún of Òkè-Ìlá, Oba Adedokun Abolarin is a highly educated professional, holding a law degree, after a master's degree in International Relations, following a bachelor's degree in Political Science, all from [[Obafemi Awolowo University]] (formerly University of Ife). Until his installation, the new Òràngún of Òkè-Ìlá, Oba Adedokun Abolarin, a professional [[lawyer]] licensed to practice law in the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] of Nigeria, was the [[partner (business rank)|principal]] [[Partner (business rank)|partner]] of Dokun Abolarin &amp; Co., a firm of Solicitors and Legal Consultants, which had served as Company Secretary to various corporations among whom are Tell Publications (Publishers of Tell Magazine), Pacific Holdings, Peachtree Communications Ltd, Sportsmark International and Springtime Development Foundation.

Oba Adedokun Abolarin is an academic authority on Nigerian government and politics having researched and written on the period from the 1914 amalgamation to recent times, in which he evaluated component elements of federal, regional/state, and local government administration, analyzed Nigerian foreign policy, political parties and pressure groups.

As is traditional among the Yoruba for a new king or monarch, Oba Adedokun Abolarin chose at his installation the “reign name” Aroyinkeye I, translating as “one who finds honey to tend the title”. Citizens of this ancient [[Igbomina]]-Yoruba kingdom across Nigeria, and especially Europe and the Americas often express their thrill and excitement at the prospect of the development which the well-educated king promises for the city and its satellite towns.

==Historical quarter/ward kings (realm/township royalties), dynastic heads==

=== Immigrant dynasties===
Oke-Ila Orangun has a couple of historical minor kings (or royals) under the Orangun of Oke-Ila. These are kings of the wards/quarters (townships or sub-towns) of Oke-Ila that consolidated as immigrant communities in the last five centuries of Oke-Ila history, as early as at its foundation subsequent to the exodus from [[Ila Yara|Ila-Yara]]. These Realm/Ward/Township Royalties retain varying degrees of royal privileges and perform their ancient royal traditions, which in Yoruba tradition is to be exercised in their [[clan]]'s territory within the consolidated kingdom. However overriding royal power is retained over the entire kingdom by the [[Orangun]] who is paramount king over the entire kingdom.

The "Ward/Township King" of the [[Isedo|Ìsèdó-Oke]] group is titled [[Obalumo|Ọba'lúmọ]]. The Ìsèdó-Oke group was the earliest (and possibly the largest single group) to join with the then Orangun [[Apakiimo]] to found his new kingdom (now called Oke-Ila) towards the end of the 15th century, about 1490 AD. The "Realm/Ward/Township royal" of the [[Iranyin]] group is titled  "[[Obanla]]"   but the position has not been filled in living memory. The role of the Obanla seems to have been taken up by (or given to) the [[Obajoko]] in the modern Royal Council of the Oke-Ila Orangun kingdom. The Iranyin group seem to be a more recent "consolidant" with Orangun's kingdom at Oke-Ila relative to the Isedo group.

=== The "Crowned Heads/Crownly Heads" Caucus &amp; incumbents ===
In the traditional royal council of Oke-Ila, both "ward/township kings" are constituted with other royal clans  - the heads of the Orangun ruling houses, into the Oriade ("Crowned Heads/Crownly Heads") - a "royal heritage caucus" of the "senate" or superior royal council.

==== "Minor kings" (of ancient immigrant wards/quarters) ====
&lt;br /&gt;
The current [[Obalumo|Ọba'lúmọ̀]] of [[Isedo|Ìsèdó-Oke]] ward/township is [[His Royal Highness]], Dr. Olúfẹ́mi Ọládàpọ̀ Babalọlá. Oral historians state that Iranyin ward/township also has a royal title called '''"Obanla"''' but the highest ranking title-holder from the Iranyin ward is the Obajoko of Iranyin ward/township. (The  "Obanla" title also exists in Ila Orangun). It is not clear if any other clan in Oke-Ila has maintained substantial relics of royal privileges. It seems that such clans would presumably be represented in the "Arewa" senate, except if removed or proscribed for some reason in historical times (before the British colonial period). However, a few other clans have maintained symbolic  noble privileges.

====Orangun Dynasty - ruling house heads====
&lt;br /&gt;
The heads of the Orangun ruling houses that are part of this "royal heritage caucus" of the "senate of ten" - (Arewa) are His Royal Highness, The Obasolo: Prince Adeoti Adesoji and  His Royal Highness, The Elemoogun: Prince  Adeyemi Olatunde.

==Educational &amp; religious institutions==
Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún has several primary and secondary schools most of which are privately owned. The premier secondary institution is the Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún Grammar School. The first primary schools are the Seventh-day Adventist Day School situated at the foot of a peak on the west edge of the city, and the Baptist Day School situated at the foot of the mountain on which the old city is located.

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] of Nigeria and the [[Baptist]] Church ([[Nigerian Baptist Convention]]) were the first churches to be established in the city. Both denominations now have multiple churches in the city. Other churches include the [[Church of Nigeria]] ([[Anglican Communion]]), the [[Apostolic Church (denomination)|Apostolic Church]], the [[Christ Apostolic Church]], the [[Cherubim &amp; Seraphim]] Church, the [[Aladura]] [[Church of the Lord (Aladura)|Church of the Lord]], and many others. The city has a central [[Mosque|masjid]] and other minor mosques where Muslims worship. The percentage of adherents of traditional religions is decreasing but there are worshipers of the major Yoruba traditional religions like [[Sango]], [[Ogoun|Ogun]], and [[Egungun]].

Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún's town hall adjoins the palace of the Òràngún, the paramount king of the kingdom.  It is named [[Apakiimo]] Town Hall, in honor of the last king of the unified kingdom who led the final exodus from [[Ila-Yara]], capital city of the original unified kingdom that subsequently became the sister kingdoms of Òkè-Ìlá Òràngún and [[Ila, Nigeria|Ìlá Òràngún]].

'''Peter Bielik''' is a Slovak historian, who withdrew his candidacy for director of the [[National Memory Institute (Slovakia)|National Memory Institute]] due to controversy over his remarks blaming Jewish [[Holocaust survivors]] for the September 1945 [[Topoľčany pogrom]].

==Life==
Bielik was an editor of ''Svedectvo'' ("Testimony"), a journal published by the Political Prisoners' Association of Anti-Communist Resistance (PV ZPKO), and an official representative of the PV ZPKO.{{sfn|Nedelsky|2016|pp=973, 976}} The journal, which has been criticized by Slovakia's Jewish community, is noted for undercurrents of [[antisemitism]] and frequently publishing [[apologetic]], mythologizing articles about convicted Slovak nationalist war criminals.{{sfn|Nedelsky|2016|pp=983–986}}

Following the death of [[Ján Langoš]], the director of the [[National Memory Institute (Slovakia)|National Memory Institute]], in 2006, the rightwing [[Slovak National Party]] (SNS) proposed Bielik as a candidate for his replacement.{{sfn|Nedelsky|2016|p=976}} In an article the previous year, Bielik had criticized the documentary ''[[Miluj blížneho svojho]]'' ("Love thy neighbor"), about the [[Topoľčany pogrom]], because he felt it was [[anti-Catholic]]. Instead, Bielik cited contemporary reports stating that "the Jews behaved very arrogantly and imperiously, trying to systematically occupy important positions in the economic, public, and political spheres". In his article, Bielik made no mention of the Holocaust,{{sfn|Nedelsky|2016|pp=976–977}} which claimed the lives of the majority of Slovak Jews, and was perpetrated by the collaborationist [[Slovak State]] in concert with [[Nazi Germany]].{{sfn|Kamenec|2002|p=130}}

Bielik presents Slovaks who stole from Jews during the war as victims of the Jews' efforts to regain their property, and the Jews as ungrateful to the majority of Slovaks to whom they supposedly owed their lives. His perspective was criticized by the contemporary Slovak media, which identified him as a supporter of the Slovak State.{{sfn|Nedelsky|2016|pp=976–977}} The Slovak Jewish newspaper ''Delet'' criticized Bielik for blaming Jews for the Topoľčany pogrom and accused him of [[Holocaust trivialization|minimizing the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lesná |first1=Ľuba |title=Quo Vadis Matica slovenská? |url=http://www.delet.sk/spravy-a-politika/editorial/quo-vadis-matica-slovenska |accessdate=11 October 2018 |work=Delet |date=8 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708015429/http://www.delet.sk/spravy-a-politika/editorial/quo-vadis-matica-slovenska |archive-date=8 July 2018 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; American historian Nadya Nedelsky compared Bielik's portrayal of the Jews with that of President [[Jozef Tiso]], a noted Holocaust perpetrator in Slovakia: to Tiso, Slovak people were victims saving themselves by deporting Jews, while to Bielik, the Slovaks are "victims and saviors of these [Jewish] perpetrators". As a result of the controversy, he withdrew his candidacy for the directorship.{{sfn|Nedelsky|2016|p=978}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Franek |first1=Jaro |title=Malé slovenské škandály |url=https://www.holocaust.cz/zdroje/clanky-z-ros-chodese/ros-chodes-2007/brezen-7/male-slovenske-skandaly-2/ |publisher=Terezín Initiative |accessdate=11 October 2018 |trans-title=A small Slovak scandal |language=cs |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170528045709/http://www.holocaust.cz/zdroje/clanky-z-ros-chodese/ros-chodes-2007/brezen-7/male-slovenske-skandaly-2/ |archive-date=28 May 2017 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he still ran for the Board of Directors, whose nominees have to be approved by the [[Slovak Parliament]]; he was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Nedelsky|2016|pp=979–980}}

In 2008, Bielik published a book titled ''Masoneria – nieszczęście naszych czasów'' ("Freemasonry — the plague of our time"), in which he blamed [[Mason (Freemasonry)|Freemasons]] for a host of social problems, including "revolts, upheavals, revolutions, murders... heresy, secularization, atheism, spiritualism, reincarnation, radical feminism, pornography, artificial contraception, sterilization, divorce, abortion and euthanasia" according to the Polish magazine ''[[Focus.pl|Focus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pytko |first1=Kazimierz |title=Opłaceni przez diabła |url=https://www.focus.pl/artykul/oplaceni-przez-diabla |accessdate=11 October 2018 |work=[[Focus.pl|Focus]] |date=29 December 2008 |language=pl-PL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018}}, Bielik was the chairman of the board of Camera Obskura, a non-profit organization that organized a conference on the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] at [[Comenius University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Konferencia August '68 v Bratislave privíta popredných domácich aj zahraničných historikov |url=https://www.bratislavskenoviny.sk/zivot-v-meste/51080-konferencia-august-68-v-bratislave-privita-poprednych-domacich-aj-zahranicnych-historikov |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=Bratislavské noviny |agency=TASR |date=16 September 2018 |language=sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Somali-Kenyan conflict''' within [[Kenya]] has been a consistent issue since the colonial period. Problems have ranged from petty skirmishes between the two communities, to police harassment, extortion, home invasions, physical violence, and [[List of massacres in Kenya|massacres]] perpetrated against the Somali-Kenyan community.

==Background==
{{main|Shifta War}}
Throughout much of the 20th century, the [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|Northern Frontier District]] (NFD) was a part of the [[Jubaland]] region in present-day southern [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name="Ospftf"&gt;{{cite book|last=Osman|first=Mohamed Amin AH|title=Somalia, proposals for the future|year=1993|publisher=SPM|pages=1–10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSsOAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 June 1960, four days before granting [[British Somaliland]] independence, the British government declared that all [[Somali people|Somali]]-inhabited areas of East Africa should be unified in one administrative region. However, after the dissolution of the former British colonies in the region, Britain granted administration of the Northern Frontier District to Kenyan nationalists despite an informal plebiscite demonstrating the overwhelming desire of the region's population to join the newly formed [[Somali Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;David D. Laitin, ''Politics, Language, and Thought: The Somali Experience'', (University Of Chicago Press: 1977), p.75&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of Kenyan independence in August 1963, British officials belatedly realised that the new Kenyan administration was not willing to give up the Somali-inhabited areas it had just been granted administration of. Led by the Northern Province People's Progressive Party (NPPPP), Somalis in the NFD vigorously sought union with their kin in the Somali Republic to the north.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Baker, ''Escape from Domination in Africa: Political Disengagement &amp; Its Consequences'', (Africa World Press: 2003), p.83&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Kenyan government enacted a number of repressive measures designed to frustrate their efforts in what came to be known as the [[Shifta War]].&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;Rhoda E. Howard, ''Human Rights in Commonwealth Africa'', (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.: 1986), p.95&lt;/ref&gt; Although the conflict ended in a cease-fire, Somalis in the region still identify and maintain close ties with their kin in Somalia.&lt;ref name="Godfrey"&gt;Godfrey Mwakikagile, ''Kenya: identity of a nation'', (Godfrey Mwakikagile: 2007), p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; They have traditionally married within their own community and formed a cohesive ethnic network.&lt;ref name="Jkuatstaic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.

==Petty skirmishes==
Between 2010–2012, Somali herders in the [[Kitui District]] in the [[Eastern Province (Kenya)|Eastern Province]] clashed with the Kenyan [[Kamba people|Kamba]] community along the Kitui and [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana River]] boundary. The conflict was related to pastureland for livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kambas and Somalis Conflict|url=https://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/mutha_somali_v_kamba.pdf|accessdate=13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical massacres==

===Garissa massacre===
{{main|Garissa Massacre}}
The [[Garissa Massacre]] was a 1980 massacre of ethnic [[Somali people|Somali]] residents by the Kenyan government in the [[Garissa District]] of the [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]]. The incident occurred when government forces, acting on the premise of flushing out a local hoodlum known as Abdi Madobe, set fire to a residential estate called Bulla Kartasi, killing people and raping women. They then forcefully interned the populace in a primary school for three days without food or water, resulting in over 3000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/5466737/Ahmed-Issac-Legal-Impediments-to-Development-in-Northern-Kenya |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023104324/http://www.scribd.com/doc/5466737/Ahmed-Issac-Legal-Impediments-to-Development-in-Northern-Kenya |archivedate=23 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }} p.10 Legal Impediments to Development in Northern Kenya, Ahmed Issack&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wagalla Massacre===
{{main|Wagalla massacre}}
The [[Wagalla massacre]] was a massacre of ethnic Somalis by Kenyan security forces on 10 February 1984 in [[Wajir District]], North Eastern Province.

The massacre took place on 10 February 1984 at the [[Wagalla Airstrip]]. The facility is situated approximately 15&amp;nbsp;km (9&amp;nbsp;mi) west of the district capital of [[Wajir]] in the [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]], a region primarily inhabited by ethnic Somalis. Kenyan troops had descended on the area to reportedly help diffuse clan-related conflict. However, according to eyewitness testimony, about 5,000 Somali men were then taken to an airstrip and prevented from accessing water and food for five days before being executed by Kenyan soldiers.&lt;ref name="Wmrookp"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12463001 Wagalla massacre: Raila Odinga orders Kenya probe]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the chairman of [[The Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission of Kenya]], a government oversight body that had been formed in response to the [[2007–2008 Kenyan crisis|2008 Kenyan post-election violence]], the Wagalla massacre represents the worst human rights violation in Kenya's history.&lt;ref name="Wmrookp"/&gt;

===Garissa University College Massacre=== 
On 2 April 2015, gunmen stormed the Garissa University College in Garissa, Kenya, killing 147 people, and injuring 79 or more. The militant group [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]] from southern Somalia, which the gunmen claimed to be from, took responsibility for the attack. The gunmen took over 700 students hostage, freeing [[Muslim]]s and killing and raping those who identified as [[Christian]]s. The siege ended the same day, when all four of the attackers were killed. Five men were later arrested in connection with the attack, and a bounty was placed for the arrest of a suspected organizer.

The attack was the deadliest in Kenya since the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]], and is the second deadliest overall, with more casualties than the [[2002 Mombasa attacks]], the 2013 [[Westgate shopping mall attack]], the [[2014 Nairobi bus bombings]], the [[2014 Gikomba bombings]], the [[2014 Mpeketoni attacks]] and the [[2014 Lamu attacks]].

==2012–2013 conflict==
{{main|Operation Linda Nchi|2011–14 terrorist attacks in Kenya}}
In October 2011, the coordinated [[Operation Linda Nchi]] between the [[Military of Somalia|Somali military]] and the [[Kenya Defence Forces|Kenyan military]] began against Al-Shabaab.&lt;ref name="Tssgskfm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/agriculture/InsidePage.php?id=2000045933&amp;cid=4&amp; |title=Somalia government supports Kenyan forces' mission |publisher=Standardmedia.co.ke |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314153558/http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/agriculture/InsidePage.php?id=2000045933&amp;cid=4&amp; |archivedate=14 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jointc"&gt;[http://www.mfa.go.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=399:joint-communique&amp;catid=35:news Joint Communique – Operation Linda Nchi]&lt;/ref&gt; The mission was officially led by the [[Somali Armed Forces]], with the Kenyan forces providing a support role.&lt;ref name="Jointc"/&gt;

Since the Operation Linda Nchi began, Al-Shabaab vowed retaliation against the Kenyan authorities. At the militant group's urging,&lt;ref name="Rastrikwhb"&gt;[http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/al-shabaab-retaliate-kenya-"huge-blasts" Al-Shabaab to retaliate in Kenya with "huge blasts"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; a significant and increasing number of terrorist attacks in Kenya have since been carried out by local Kenyans, many of whom are recent converts to [[Islam]].&lt;ref name="Nkanbotib"&gt;[http://www.newsomali.com/2011/10/29/7571/ Kenya: A new breed of terrorist is born]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates in 2012 placed the figure of Kenyan fighters at around 10% of Al-Shabaab's total forces.&lt;ref name="Rspiaamgga"&gt;{{cite news|title=Special Report: In Africa, a militant group's growing appeal|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/30/us-shabaab-east-africa-idUSBRE84T0NI20120530|newspaper=Reuters|date=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referred to as the "Kenyan Mujahideen" by Al-Shabaab's core members,&lt;ref name="Nkanbotib"/&gt; the converts are typically young and overzealous, poverty making them easier targets for the group's recruitment activities. Because the Kenyan insurgents have a different profile from the Somali and Arab militants that allows them to blend in with the general population of Kenya, they are also often harder to track. Reports suggest that Al-Shabaab is attempting to build an even more multi-ethnic generation of fighters in the larger region.&lt;ref name="Rspiaamgga"/&gt; One such recent convert who helped carry out the [[Kampala]] bombings but now cooperates with the Kenyan police believes that in doing so, the group is essentially trying to use local Kenyans to do its "dirty work" for it while its core members escape unscathed.&lt;ref name="Nkanbotib"/&gt; According to diplomats, Muslim areas in coastal Kenya and [[Tanzania]], such as [[Mombasa]] and [[Zanzibar]], are also especially vulnerable for recruitment.&lt;ref name="Rspiaamgga"/&gt;

On 18 November 2012, 10 people were killed and 25 seriously injured when an explosion ripped apart a route 28 mass transit mini-bus ([[matatu]]) in [[Eastleigh, Kenya|Eastleigh]]. The blast was believed to have been an improvised explosive device or bomb of some sort.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/6-dead-in-Eastleigh-matatu-explosion/-/539546/1624650/-/14asbjk/-/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Looting and destruction of Somali-owned homes and shops by angry mobs of young Kenyans ensued.&lt;ref name="Rkscin"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gogoneni|first=Rupo|title=Kenyans, Somalis clash in Nairobi|url=http://www.english.rfi.fr/africa/20121121-somalis-kenyans-clash-nairobi|accessdate=21 November 2012|newspaper=RFI|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somalis defended their property, and interpreted the bus explosion as a pretext for non-Somalis to steal from their community.&lt;ref name=Pbbkasin&gt;{{cite news|last=Vincenot|first=Aymeric|title=Pitched battles between 'Kenyans' and Somalis in Nairobi|url=http://www.namibian.com.na/news/africa/full-story/archive/2012/november/article/pitched-battles-between-kenyans-and-somalis-in-nairobi/|accessdate=21 November 2012|newspaper=AFP|date=21 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130221115819/http://www.namibian.com.na/news/africa/full-story/archive/2012/november/article/pitched-battles-between-kenyans-and-somalis-in-nairobi/|archivedate=21 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 November 2012, Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) swooped on Garissa in a military operation. KDF soldiers subsequently burned down the local market and shot at a crowd of protesters,&lt;ref name="Hsiltbbmwtw"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aynte|first=Abdi|title=How Shabaab is losing the battle, but maybe winning the war|url=http://africanarguments.org/2012/11/21/how-shabaab-is-losing-the-battle-but-maybe-winning-the-war-%E2%80%93-by-abdi-aynte/|accessdate=21 November 2012|newspaper=African Arguments|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; killing a woman and injuring 10 people. Another 35 residents were also receiving treatment at the provincial hospital after being assaulted by the soldiers, including a chief and two pupils. A group of MPs led by [[Farah Maalim]] accused Kenyan officers of inciting violence, raping women and shooting at students, and threatened to take the matter to the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) if the perpetrators were not brought to justice.&lt;ref name="Wktiigs"&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman killed, 10 injured in Garissa swoop |url=http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/article-96560/woman-killed-10-injured-garissa-swoop |accessdate=21 November 2012 |newspaper=The Star |date=21 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128023359/http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/article-96560/woman-killed-10-injured-garissa-swoop |archivedate=28 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masouuf"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wafula|first=Caroline|title=MPs accuse State of using undue force|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/MPs-accuse-State-of-using-undue-force/-/1064/1625062/-/uc0i5vz/-/index.html|accessdate=21 November 2012|newspaper=Daily Nation|date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maalim also suggested that the deployment of the soldiers was unconstitutional and had not received the requisite parliamentary approval,&lt;ref name="Wktiigs"/&gt; and that the ensuing rampage cost Garissa entrepreneurs over Sh1.5 billion to Sh2 billion in missed revenue.&lt;ref name="Masouuf"/&gt; Additionally, Sheikhs with the CPK threatened to sue the military commanders for crimes against humanity committed during the operation.&lt;ref name="Wktiigs"/&gt; However, general harassment of the Somali community by Kenyan policemen continued, with some officers going as far as invading the homes of Somali businesspeople to steal precious jewellery, foreign currencies and electronic devices, including expensive phones, laptops and other personal accessories.&lt;ref name="Ktcohsot"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mohammed|first=Guled|title=Kenya: The Cost of Harassing Somalis Over Terror|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201301100532.html|accessdate=13 January 2013|newspaper=The Star|date=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By January 2013, a mass exodus of Somali residents was reported. Hundreds of Somali entrepreneurs withdrew between Sh10 to Sh40 billion from their bank accounts in Kenya, with the intention of reinvesting most of that money back home in Somalia. The collective departures most affected Eastleigh's real estate sector, as landlords struggled to find Kenyans able to afford the high rates of the apartments and shops vacated by the Somalis.&lt;ref name="Ktcohsot"/&gt;

Maritime border dispute is a problem which Kenya claims over Somali waters and the solution was held by the ICJ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1368">A '''squeeze''' or '''squeeze paper''' is a reverse copy of an [[Epigraphy|inscription]], made by applying moist [[filter paper]] and pushing into the indentations by percussive use of a stiff brush.   The paper is allowed to dry and then removed.  The image is reversed from the inscription, and  protrudes from the squeeze paper.

The use of a squeeze allows more information to be gleaned than examining the original inscription, for example curves inside the cuts can identify the scribe who originally carved the inscription.&lt;ref name="TIH"&gt;Taking Inscriptions Home  University of Reading, Ure Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

Squeezes can also (and some have been since the 1950s) be made by applying layers of [[liquid latex]].  This method works best on horizontal surfaces.&lt;ref name="TIH" /&gt;

Modern digitising methods mean that the image can be restored to the original orientation.

Large collections of squeezes are held by the ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]'' and other epigraphic collections.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5491">{{about|the Babylonian month|the Mesopotamian god after which the month takes its name|Dumuzid the Shepherd|the corresponding Hebrew month|Tammuz (Hebrew month)}}
'''Tammuz''' was a month in the [[Babylonian calendar]], named for one of the main [[Babylonia]]n gods, [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] (Sumerian: ''Dumuzid'', "son of life").&lt;ref name=Hastingsp676&gt;Hastings, 2004, p. 676.&lt;/ref&gt; Many different calendar systems have since adopted Tammuz to refer to a month in the summer season.  

In the [[Hebrew calendar]], [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]] is the tenth month of the civil year and the fourth month of the ecclesiastical year on the [[Hebrew calendar]]. It is a summer month of 29 days. Tammuz is also the name for the month of July in the [[Gregorian calendar]] in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (تموز), [[Syriac language|Syriac]] (''ܬܡܘܙ'') and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ("Temmuz").&lt;ref name=Craggp260&gt;Cragg, 1991, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival for the deity Tammuz was held throughout the month of Tammuz in midsummer, and celebrated his death and resurrection.&lt;ref name=Bromileyp89/&gt; The first day of the month of Tammuz was the day of the [[new moon]] of the [[summer solstice]].&lt;ref name=Kittop825&gt;Kitto, 1846, p. 825.&lt;/ref&gt; On the second day of the month, there was lamentation over the death of Tammuz, on the 9th, 16th and 17th days torchlit processions, and on the last three days, an image of Tammuz was buried.&lt;ref name=Bromileyp89&gt;Bromiley, 1995, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Arabic sources===
Tammuz is the month of July in [[Arabic language|Arabic]],&lt;ref name="Craggp260" /&gt; and references to the month of Tammuz, its history, and celebratory rites with which it is associated are discussed in [[Arabic literature]] from the 9th to 11th centuries AD.&lt;ref name=Fullerp200&gt;Fuller, 1864, pp. 200-201.&lt;/ref&gt; In his translation of an earlier work, [[Ibn Wahshiyya]] (c. 9th-10th century AD), enumerates the months of the [[Babylonia]]n year adding a remark that [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]] lived in [[Babylonia]] before the coming of the [[Chaldea]]ns and belonged to an ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n tribe called Ganbân.&lt;ref name=Fullerp200/&gt; He further adds that the [[Sabians]] in [[Harran]] and Babylonia still lamented the loss of Tammuz every July, but that the origin of the worship had been lost.&lt;ref name=Fullerp200/&gt; [[Ibn al-Nadim|Al-Nadim]] in his 10th century work ''Kitab al-Fehrest'' drawing from a work on [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] calendar feast days, describes a Tâ'ûz festival that took place in the middle of the month of Tammuz.&lt;ref name=Fullerp200/&gt; Women bewailed the death of Tammuz at the hands of his master who was said to have "ground his bones in a mill and scattered them to the wind."&lt;ref name=Fullerp200/&gt; Consequently, women would forgo the eating of ground foods during the festival time.&lt;ref name=Fullerp200/&gt; The same festival is mentioned in the 11th century by [[Ibn Athir]] as still taking place in the month of Tammuz on the banks of the [[Tigris]] river.&lt;ref name=Fullerp200/&gt;

[[Ma'ruf al-Rusafi]] (1875–1945), a leading [[Iraq]]i poet, wrote a poem entitled ''Tammuz al-Hurriyya'' ("July, the month of freedom") to celebrate the [[Young Turk Revolution]] of 1908 and the deposition of [[Abdul Hamid II|'Abd al-Hamid]], the last [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] [[sultan]].&lt;ref name=Genequandp614&gt;Genequand, 1986, p. 614.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1958 revolution in Iraq took place on the 14th of July. The 1968 [[Ba'ath]] revolution in Iraq took place in the month of Tammuz, and the [[Osirak]] nuclear reactor built by [[Saddam Hussein]] in 1977 and destroyed by [[Israel]] in 1981 was known domestically as Tammuz, a reference to the month of July when temperatures in Iraq reach their highest levels and it is unbearably hot.&lt;ref name=Obeidip42&gt;Obeidi and Pitzer, 2004, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[2006 Lebanon War]] is known in [[Lebanon]] and much of the [[Arab world]] as حرب تموز ''Ḥarb Tammūz'' (the July War), following the Arab custom of naming the [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Arab-Israeli wars]] by months or years.

The '''Tanais Tablets''' are two tablets dated late 2nd-3rd century AD, and written in [[Greek language|Greek]] from the city of [[Tanais]], in the proximity of modern [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Russia]].{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=15}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ustinova |first=Yulia |date=1999 |title=The Supreme Gods of the Bosporan Kingdom: Celestial Aphrodite and the Most High God |url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=ARyeneZne9gC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq=tanais+stone&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2mqmU5ruGIvboASd1ICYDg&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=tanais%20stone&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Brill |page=194 |isbn=9004112316 |accessdate=June 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Tanais was composed of a mixed [[Greek people|Greek]] and [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] population. The tablets are public inscriptions which commemorate renovation works in the city. One of the tablets, Tanais Tablet A, is damaged and is not fully reconstructed.{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=19-20}} The other one, Tanais Tablet B, is fully preserved and is dated to 220 AD.{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=22}}
 
The tablets were discovered by Russian archaeologist Pavel Mikhailovich Leontjev in 1853 and are today kept in the lapidary of the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=9}} The tablets are considered important for the early [[Croats|Croatian]] history.

==Significance==
Among the names on the tablets are those of three men: Horoúathos, Horoáthos, and Horóathos (Χορούαθ[ος], Χοροάθος, Χορόαθος).{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=9}} Those names scholars interpret as [[anthroponym]]s of the Croatian ethnonym ''Hrvat''.{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=25-27}} The ethnonym ''Hrvat'' is generally considered to be of Iranian origin,&lt;ref name="Gluhak"&gt;{{citation |first=Alemko |last=Gluhak |author-link=Alemko Gluhak |title=Podrijetlo imena Hrvat |trans-title=The origin of the ethnonym Hrvat |publisher=[[Jezik]] (Croatian Philological Society) |location=Zagreb |year=1990 |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&amp;id_clanak_jezik=116509&amp;lang=en |language=Croatian |pages=131–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Matasovic"&gt;{{citation |first=Ranko |last=Matasović |author-link=Ranko Matasović |title=Poredbenopovijesna gramatika hrvatskoga jezika |trans-title=A Comparative and Historical Grammar of Croatian |publisher=[[Matica hrvatska]] |location=Zagreb |year=2008 |isbn=978-953-150-840-7 |language=Croatian |pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that can be traced to the Tanais Tablets.&lt;ref name="Gluhak"/&gt;{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=25-27}} The Tanais Tablet B mentions Horoathos as the son of Sandarz which is a [[Scythian languages|Scytho-Sarmatian]] name, and scholars view this as an indication that early Croats could have been at that time [[Sarmatians]] or [[Alans]] who became [[Slavicisation|Slavicized]] in the following centuries.&lt;ref name="Gluhak"/&gt;{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=25-27}}

==Research history==
The tablets were discovered by the Russian archeologist Pavel Mihajlovič Leontjev (1822-1874) in September 1853. Mostly international scholars wrote about the tablets, while of Croatian scholars [[Stjepan Krizin Sakač]], [[Dominik Mandić]] and [[Radoslav Katičić]].{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=10}} However, during the time of [[Yugoslavia]], Yugoslavian scholars avoided discussing them,{{sfn|Džino|2010|p=21}} or mainly wrote about them in a superficial way and misinterpreted ([[Ferdo Šišić]], [[Trpimir Macan]], Josip Horvat, [[Bogo Grafenauer]], Jaroslav Šidak, Gordan Ravančić, Ivan Biondić, Stjepan Pantelić etc.),{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=10-19}} and sometimes malicious manner, for example, [[Miroslav Krleža]] saw the connection as "historical lunacy", while [[Nada Klaić]] ignored and only mentioned them for the criticizing of the Iranian-Caucasian theory of the Croatian ethnogenesis.{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=11}} The open debate only followed after the collapse of Yugoslav Communism.{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=11}}

First who connected the tablets personal names with Croatian ethnonym was A. L. Pogodin in 1902,{{sfn|Heršak, Nikšić|2007|p=263}}{{sfn|Heršak, Lazanin|1999|p=26}} while first who considered such a thesis and Iranian origin was [[Konstantin Josef Jireček]] in 1911.{{sfn|Košćak|1995|p=110}} It should be noted that some scholars use this tablets only to explain the etymology, and not necessarily the ethnogenesis.{{sfn|Heršak, Nikšić|2007|p=260}}

However, whether the early Croats have been Slavs who taken the name of Iranian origin or were ruled by Sarmatian elite caste,&lt;ref name="Gluhak"/&gt; or were Slavicized Sarmatians,&lt;ref name="Gluhak"/&gt; the remote Irano-Sarmatian elements or influences on the Croatian ethnogenesis cannot be entirely excluded.{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=12}}{{sfn|Džino|2010|p=21}} Still, the secure connection of those three personal names with the Croatian ethnonym, or ethnic identity, is rather difficult without more evidence.{{sfn|Džino|2010|p=21}}

==Tanais Tablet A==
[[File:Танаис, археологический музей-заповедник-14.jpg|thumb|Tanais table A]]

The Tablet A is the larger and older inscription, dated to 175-211 AD, and which originates from the time when king [[Tiberius Julius Sauromates II]] (175-211 AD) ruled the [[Bosporan Kingdom]].{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=19}} The marble tablet (0.92 x 0.73 x 0.09) probably sustained heavy damage even before the excavation.{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=19}} Thirty-two lines from thirty fragments were saved from the inscription.{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=20}} The public inscription mentions the king, the synod, or devotional assembly, the leadership of the devotional assembly, and its regular members, which were slightly less than forty.{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=20}} The fourth line ends by mentioning of the father of the devotional assembly, Horoúathos (Χορούαθος), who is referred to by name in the fifth line,{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=20}} and amongst others an unknown male who is said to be the son of Horoáthos (Χοροάθου) is also cited.{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=21}} The inscription ends with the date, from which is saved only the appellation of the Greek-Macedonian month, which corresponds to either July or August.{{sfn|Škegro|2005|p=21}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4330">'''Thierry de Limburg Stirum''' ([[Antwerp]] 11 April 1827 - [[Brussels]] 6 March 1911) was a Belgian historian, and Senator.

==Family==

Count Thierry Marie Joseph de [[Limburg Stirum]] was the son of Willem de [[Limburg Stirum]] (1795–1889) and Albertine de Pret de Calesberg (1800–1856). Willem, of Dutch and Gelders origin, served in the French imperial army and later in the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] army after 1815. Following the creation of Belgium, Thierry received Belgian citizenship in 1841.

He married in 1856 Countess Marie-Thérèse de Thiennes Leyenburg et de [[Rumbeke]] ([[Ghent]] 1828 - Brussels 1909), daughter of Count François de Thiennes, Chamberlain of King Guillaume of the Netherlands and Baroness Asterie de Draeck.

They had four children, among whom were [[Henri, Count of Limburg Stirum|Henri de Limburg Stirum]] (1864–1953), mayor of [[Rumbeke]] and [[Evrard, Count of Limburg Stirum|Evrard de Limburg Stirum]] (1868–1938), mayor of [[Huldenberg]], who both had numerous descendents.

==Life==

Thierry de Limburg Stirum was Doctor in Law ([[KU Leuven]]) and Belgian [[senator]] for the department of [[Ostende]]-[[Veurne]]-[[Diksmuide]] from 1878 to 1900.

He was president of the [[Conseil Heraldique]] and president of the Royal Commission for Ancient Laws and Ordinances.

In 1870 he became a member of the [[Genootschap voor geschiedenis te Brugge|Society for History of Bruges]], known under the name 'Société d'Emulation'. From 1891 until his death he was president of that Society.

'''Thomas Campbell Wasson''' (February 8, 1896 &amp;ndash; 23 May 1948) was an [[United States|American]] diplomat who was killed while serving as the Consul General for the United States in [[Jerusalem]]. He was also a member of the [[United Nations]] Truce Commission.&lt;ref&gt;'Taking Sides', Stephen Green, Faber And Faber, 1984. {{ISBN|0-571-13271-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography ==
Wasson was born February 8, 1896 in [[Great Falls, Montana]] and raised in [[Newark, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [https://www.nytimes.com/1948/05/23/archives/wasson-long-in-service-started-as-clerk-in-the-melbourne-consulate.html "Wasson Long In Service; Started as Clerk in the Melbourne Consulate in 1924"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 23, 1948. Accessed March 7, 2018. "Mr. Wasson was born in Great Falls, Mont., on Feb, 8, 1896, the son of Edmund Atwill and Mary DeVeny Wasson, His family moved to Newark, N. J., shortly after is birth and he received his schooling in the Newark grammar and high schools."&lt;/ref&gt; From 1926 to 1929, he served as the United States Vice Consul in [[Melbourne, Australia]]. In 1932, he was Vice Consul in [[Puerto Cortes]], [[Honduras]], and in 1938, became the Consul in [[Lagos, Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicalgraveyard.com] political graveyard web site. Omits subsequent Jerusalem posting&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1948, Wasson was appointed as the Consul General for the US in Jerusalem.
[[File:Thomas C. Wasson - Funeral.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Funeral of Thomas C. Wasson and US Naval Officer Herbert C. Walker, Santa Maria Convent of the Sisters of the Holy Rosary, Jerusalem, May 1948; photo taken by [[John Roy Carlson]]]]

On 19 May 1948, ''[[The Scotsman]]'' quoted a report by Wasson saying the British Consul had a "narrow escape" when the consulate came under gunfire. On 22 May, it was reported that Wasson had attempted to stop the [[Arab Legion]] shelling of the [[Hadassah Hospital]] and [[Hebrew University]] on [[Mount Scopus]]: "The American Consul is reported to have contacted the Legion requesting it to stop firing on Jewish positions in and around the buildings. The Legion's commander replied that the buildings were being used by Jewish forces to mortar and machine-gun the Arab-occupied Sheikh Jarrah quarter and handed the Consul surrender terms to convey to the Jews. The commander asked that all fighting Jews in the hospital and university surrender as prisoners of war and that all doctors, nurses, professors, and scientists be handed over to the Red Cross."

Later the same day, just after 2.00pm, Wasson was shot while returning to the US Consulate from a meeting of the UN Truce Commission at the French Consulate in Jerusalem. While crossing Wauchope Street (now Abraham Lincoln/Hess) to enter the alley leading to the consulate, he was shot by a .30 caliber rifle. The bullet entered his chest via his right upper arm and left level to his second costal cartilage.&lt;ref&gt;UN Security Council, telegram S/771, 22 May 1948&lt;/ref&gt; Wasson died the following day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afsa.org/plaquelist.cfm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427075802/http://www.afsa.org/plaquelist.cfm# |date=2010-04-27 }} American Foreign Service Association web site: 'shot by sniper'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Our Jerusalem', Bertha Spafford Vester, Copyright dated 1950, printed in Lebanon. p.379 quotes diary: 'shot by Jews'&lt;/ref&gt;

Wasson's funeral was narrated by the American journalist [[Arthur Derounian]] (John Roy Carlson) in his book "Cairo to Damascus".&lt;ref&gt;John Roy Carlson, ''Cairo to Damascus'', Chapter XV: A Week of Agony: A Consule is Murdered, pp. 279-280.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wasson was replaced by Vice-Consul William Burdette.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Scotsman]], May 24th, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; Wasson's body was returned to the [[United States]] and interred at [[Washington National Cathedral]].

==Dispute about shooter==
The shooter was never identified. In the aftermath of the killing, there were contradictory reports on whether the gun was fired by an Arab or Jew. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on 23 May that Wasson "on his death bed stated that Arabs had shot him," but retracted the statement two weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Green 'Taking Sides'.Faber &amp; Faber. 1984. {{ISBN|0-571-13271-5}}. pp.32/33. quoting New York Times 23 May and 5 June 1948&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 May, [[The Scotsman]] newspaper quoted an Israeli government statement that Wasson "was killed by Arab bullets." According to [[The New York Post]] (NYP) on 8 June, sources in [[Amman]] claimed Wasson was shot by the Israelis, but that this was contradicted by Wasson's alleged last words in hospital. The NYP report claimed that an American government document stated that his dying words, to the Jewish nurses at his bedside, were that he had been shot by Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.varchive.org/obs/480608.htm America’s Sorry Record in Failing to Protect Flag or Citizen Abroad Since Nov.], New York Post, Tuesday, June 8, 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first edition of her book "Our Jerusalem", a history of the [[American Colony (Jerusalem)|American Colony]] in Jerusalem, [[Bertha Spafford Vester]] quotes her diary entry for 23 May 1948: "Our American Consul, Mr. Robert Wasson was shot by Jews on Friday and died today."&lt;ref&gt;"Our Jerusalem. An American Family in the Holy City 1881-1949." p.379. Published by the Middle East Export Press.INC. Printed in Lebanon. Copyright, 1950 Bertha Spafford Vesta and Evelyn Wells.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his account, published in 1960, the Military Governor of Jerusalem, Dov Joseph, wrote that Wasson "was shot on 22 May by an Arab sniper."&lt;ref&gt;'The Faithful City', Simon and Schuster, 1960. p.219&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomatic reports==
On April 15, 1948, in a report concerning the [[Hadassah Hospital Convoy Massacre]], Wasson wrote, "American correspondent eye witnessed removal from trucks large quantities arms and ammunition and speculated whether for escort or other purpose."

On April 17, 1948, he wrote: " . . . queried as to whether convoy included armoured cars, Haganah guards, arms and ammunition in addition to doctors, nurses and patients, Kohn [of the Jewish Agency] replied in affirmative saying it was necessary to protect convoy."&lt;ref&gt;Telegrams 439 &amp; 455, Jerusalem Consular Files, Series 800 Palestine, Record Group 84, National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18, 1948, Wasson wrote: "Looting in the captured Arab areas has now been so widespread and has been regarded with such indifference by the authorities that it is difficult not to think it is officially tolerated."&lt;ref&gt;'O Jerusalem', Larry Collins, Dominique Lapierre. 1972. p.588&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beauchamp7.JPG|thumb|A caricature in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' from 1899, showing [[William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp|a British peer]] wearing white tie]]
'''White tie''', also called '''full evening dress''' or a '''dress suit''', is the most formal evening [[Western dress codes|dress code in Western high fashion]]. For men, it consists of a black dress [[tailcoat]] worn over a white starched [[shirt]], [[piqu%C3%A9_(weaving)|marcella]] [[waistcoat]] and the eponymous white [[bow tie]] worn around a [[detachable collar]]. High-waisted black [[trousers]] and [[patent leather]] shoes complete the outfit, although decorations can be worn and a [[top hat]] and white scarf are acceptable as accessories. Women wear full length [[evening gown|evening]] or [[ball gown]] and, optionally, jewellery, tiaras, a small bag and evening gloves. 

The dress code's origins can be traced to the end of the 18th century, when high society men began abandoning their [[breeches]], lacy shirts and richly decorated evening coats for more austere tailcoats in dark colours, a look inspired by the country gentleman. Fashionable [[dandies]] like [[Beau Brummell]] popularised a [[minimalist]] style in the [[Regency era]], tending to favour dark blue or black tailcoats, often with trousers instead of breeches, and white shirts, waistcoats and cravats. By the 1840s the minimalist black and white combination had become the standard evening wear for [[upper class]] men. Despite the emergence of the [[Tuxedo|dinner jacket]] (or tuxedo) as a less formal and more comfortable alternative in the 1880s, full evening dress remained the staple. At the [[1900s in fashion|turn of the 20th century]], white became the only colour of waistcoats and ties worn with full evening dress, contrasting with black ties and waistcoats with the dinner jacket, an ensemble which became known as [[black tie]].

From the 1920s onward black tie slowly replaced white tie as the default evening wear for important events, so that by the 21st century white tie had become rare. White tie nowadays tends to be reserved for special ceremonies—especially [[state dinner]]s—and a very select group of social events such as the [[Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner|Al Smith Memorial Dinner]] in New York, the [[Commemoration ball]]s at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], certain [[May Ball|May Balls]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], the June Ball at [[University of Durham | Durham University]], the Christmas ball at [[Buckingham Palace]], dinners of certain American hereditary societies, and very formal weddings. The [[Vienna Opera Ball]] and the [[Nobel Prize]] ceremony are white tie events, and some European universities retain it as the dress code for doctoral conferment ceremonies.

===Traditions===

According to the British etiquette guide ''[[Debrett's]]'', the central components of full evening dress for men are a white [[Piqué (weaving)|marcella]] shirt with a detachable wing [[Collar (clothing)|collar]] and single [[cuff]]s, fastened with studs and [[cufflink]]s; the eponymous white marcella [[bow tie]] is worn around the collar, while a low-cut marcella [[waistcoat]] is worn over the shirt. Over this is worn a black single-breasted [[barathea]] wool or ultrafine [[Herringbone (cloth)|herringbone]] tailcoat with silk peak [[lapel]]s. The trousers have double-braiding down the outside of both legs, while the correct shoes are [[patent leather]] or highly polished black [[dress shoes]]. Although a white scarf remains popular in winter, the traditional white gloves, [[top hats]], canes and cloaks are now rare. Women wear a full-length evening dress, with the option of jewellery, a tiara, a pashmina, coat or wrap. Long gloves are not compulsory.&lt;ref name="debretts"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.debretts.com/british-etiquette/british-behaviour/h/dress-codes/white-tie|title=White Tie|work=Debrett's|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The waistcoat should not be visible below the front of the tailcoat, which necessitates a high waistline and (often) braces for the trousers. As one style writer for [[GQ]] magazine summarises "The simple rule of thumb is that you should only ever see black and white not black, white and black again".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author-first=Robert|author-last=Johnston|title=Attire to suit the occasion|work=GQ|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/style/style-shrink/expert-answer-/style-shrink-dress-suit-etiquette|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Evening Tailcoat|work=Ede &amp; Ravenscroft|url=http://shop.edeandravenscroft.com/collections/white-tie/products/evening-tail-coat|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Debrett's'' accepts double cuffs for shirts worn with white tie,&lt;ref name="debretts"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.debretts.com/british-etiquette/british-behaviour/h/dress-codes/white-tie|title=White Tie|work=Debrett's|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; some tailors and merchant suggest that single, linked cuffs are the most traditional and formal variation acceptable under the dress code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savvyrow.co.uk/blogs/savvy-blog/16133636-white-tie-dress-code "White tie dress code"]. ''Savvy Row''. Retrieved 26 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Decorations may also be worn and, unlike ''Debrett's'', [[Cambridge University]]'s ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]'' student newspaper suggests a top hat, opera cloak and silver-topped cane are acceptable accessories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author-last=Sharpe|author-first=James|title=Fix Up, Look Sharpe: Dress codes|work=Varsity|date=9 May 2011|url=http://www.varsity.co.uk/fashion/archives/fix-up-look-sharpe-dress-codes|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some invitations to white-tie events, like the last published edition of the British ''Lord Chamberlain's Guide to Dress at Court'', state that national costume or national dress may be substituted for white tie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/prtcl/vest-eng.cfm |year=1985| title=Dress| work="Diplomatic and Consular Relations and Protocol" External Affairs |author=Canadian Heritage |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/ceremonies/dresscode/| title=The Dress Code at the Nobel Banquet: What to wear?|author= Nobleprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other variations===

====Military dress====
Prior to World War II formal style of military dress was generally restricted to the [[British Armed Forces|British]], [[British Empire]] and [[United States armed forces]]; although the French, [[Imperial German Navy|Imperial German]], Swedish and other navies had adopted their own versions of mess dress during the late nineteenth century, influenced by the [[Royal Navy]].{{sfnp|Knötel|Knötel|Sieg|1980|pp=442–445}}

In the US Army, [[Mess_dress#United_States|evening mess uniform]], in either blue or white, is the appropriate military uniform for white-tie occasions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncoguide.com/files/da-pam-670_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|date=December 2016}} The blue mess and white mess uniforms are black-tie equivalents, although the [[Army Service Uniform]] with bow tie are accepted, especially for non-commissioned officers and newly commissioned officers. For white-tie occasions, of which there are almost none in the United States outside the national capital region for US Army, an officer must wear a wing-collar shirt with white tie and white vest. For black-tie occasions, officers must wear a turndown collar with black tie and black cummerbund.  The only outer coat prescribed for both black- and white-tie events is the army blue cape with branch color lining.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncoguide.com/files/da-pam-670_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Clerical dress====
Certain clergymen wear, in place of white-tie outfits, a [[cassock]] with [[ferraiolo]]ne, which is a light-weight ankle-length cape intended to be worn indoors.  The colour and fabric of the ferraiolone is determined by the rank of the cleric and can be scarlet watered silk, purple silk, black silk or black wool. For outerwear the black cape (cappa nigra), also known as a choir cape (cappa choralis), is most traditional.  It is a long black woollen cloak fastened with a clasp at the neck and often has a hood.  Cardinals and bishops may also wear a black plush hat or, less formally, a [[biretta]]. In practice, the cassock and especially the ferraiolone have become much less common and no particular formal attire has appeared to replace them.  The most formal alternative is a clerical waistcoat incorporating a Roman collar (a rabat) worn with a collarless French cuff shirt and a black suit, although this is closer to "black-tie" than white-tie.
Historically, clerics in the [[Church of England]] would wear a knee-length cassock called an apron, accompanied by a tailcoat with silk facings but no lapels, for a white tie occasion. In modern times this is rarely seen. However, if worn, the knee-length cassock is now replaced with normal dress trousers.

== 19th century: origins and development ==
[[File:Kabarett der Komiker; Rudolf Platte 013558c.jpg|thumb|The German actor [[Rudolf Platte]] wearing white tie on stage in 1937]]

Throughout the [[Early Modern period]], western European male courtiers and aristocrats donned elaborate clothing at ceremonies and dinners: coats (often richly decorated), frilly and lacy shirts and breeches formed the backbone of their most formal attire. As the 18th century drew to a close, high society began adopting more austere clothing which drew inspiration from the dark hues and simpler designs adopted by country gentlemen.&lt;ref name=":26"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2014/02/tuxedos_at_the_oscars_a_guide_to_appreciating_the_best_and_worst_menswear.html|title = A Field Guide to Tuxedos|last = Marshall|first = Peter|date = |work = Slate|access-date = 30 September 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 18th century, two forms of tail coat were in common use by upper class men in Britain and continental Europe: the more formal dress coat (cut away horizontally at the front) and the less formal [[morning coat]], which curved back from the front to the tails. From around 1815, a knee-length garment called the [[frock coat]] became increasingly popular and was eventually established, along with the morning coat, as smart daywear in Victorian England. The dress coat, meanwhile, became reserved for wear in the evening.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2003, pp. 886&lt;/ref&gt; The [[dandy]] [[Beau Brummell]] adopted a minimalistic approach to evening wear—a white waistcoat, dark blue tailcoat, black pantaloons and striped stockings.&lt;ref&gt;Carter 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Although Brummell felt black an ugly colour for evening dress coats, it was adopted by other dandies, like [[Charles Baudelaire]], and black and white had become the standard colours by the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 1982, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2003, p. 887&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the 19th century, the monotone colour scheme became a codified standard for evening events after 6 p.m. in upper class circles.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; The styles evolved and evening dress consisted of a black dress coat and trousers, white or black waistcoat, and a bow tie by the 1870s. The [[dinner jacket]] (tuxedo) emerged as a less formal and more comfortable alternative to full evening dress in the 1880s and, by the early 20th century, full evening dress meant wearing a white waistcoat and tie with a black tailcoat and trousers, the tuxedo incorporated a black bow tie and waistcoat: white tie had become distinct from black tie.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2003, pp. 888, 890&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its growing popularity, the dinner jacket remained the reserve of family dinners and gentlemen's clubs during the late Victorian period.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;

==20th century==
[[File:StateLibQld 1 104628 Guests pictured at the Royal Ball, Brisbane, 1954.jpg|thumb|Guests at the white-tie Royal Ball in [[Brisbane]], 1954]]
By the turn of the 20th century, full evening dress consisted of a black tailcoat made of heavy fabric weighing 16-18 oz per yard. Its lapels were medium width and the white shirt worn beneath it had a heavily starched, stiff front, fastened with pearl or black studs and either a winged collar or a type called a "poke", consisting of a high band with a slight curve at the front.&lt;ref&gt;Schoeffler 1973, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I, the dinner jacket became more popular, especially in the US, and informal variations sprang up, like the soft, turn-down collar shirt and later the double-breasted jacket;&lt;ref&gt;Schoeffler 1973, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; relaxing social norms in [[Jazz Age]] America meant white tie was replaced by black tie as the default evening wear for young men, especially at nightclubs.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; According to ''[[The Delineator]]'', the years after [[World War I]] saw white tie "almost abandoned".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=c6EeAQAAMAAJ The Delineator]'', vol. 128 (January 1936), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; But it did still have a place: the American etiquette writer [[Emily Post]] stated in 1922 that "A gentleman must always be in full dress, tail coat, white waistcoat, white tie and white gloves" when at the opera, yet she called the tuxedo "essential" for any gentleman, writing that "It is worn every evening and nearly everywhere, whereas the tail coat is necessary only at balls, formal dinners, and in a box at the opera."&lt;ref&gt;Emily Post (1922). ''[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14314/14314-h/14314-h.htm Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics and at Home]''. New York and London: Funk and Wagnalls co. chap. vi, xxxiv&lt;/ref&gt; 

It also continued to evolve. White tie was worn with slim-cut trousers in the early 1920s; by 1926, wide-lapelled tailcoats and double-breasted waistcoats were in vogue.&lt;ref&gt;Schoeffler 1973, pp. 169-170&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Edward VIII|Duke of Windsor]] (then Prince of Wales and later Edward VIII) wore a [[midnight blue]] tailcoat, trousers and waistcoat in the 1920s and 1930s both to "soften" the contrast between black and white and allow for photographs to depict the nuances of his tailoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/82170|title = Evening suit|date = |accessdate = 1 October 2015|website = The Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The late 1920s and 1930s witnessed a resurgence in the dress code's popularity,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schoeffler 1973, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; but by 1953, one etiquette writer stressed that "The modern trend is to wear 'tails' only for the most formal and ceremonious functions, such as important formal dinners, balls, elaborate evening weddings, and opening night at the opera".&lt;ref&gt;Lillian Eichler Watson (1953). ''New Standard Book of Etiquette''. New York: Garden Publishing Company. p. 358&lt;/ref&gt;

The last president to have worn white tie at a [[United States presidential inauguration]] was President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1961, who wore  [[morning dress]] for [[Inauguration of John F. Kennedy|his inauguration]], and a white tie ensemble for his [[United States presidential inaugural balls|inauguration ball]].

== 21st century ==
White tie is rarely worn in the early 21st century.&lt;ref name="debretts"/&gt; Nevertheless, it survives as the formal dress code for royal ceremonies, [[debutante ball]]s, and a select group of other social events in some countries. The male form has also been adopted for some formal weddings.&lt;ref name="debretts"/&gt;

Notable international recurrent white tie events include the [[Nobel Prize]] ceremony in [[Sweden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/ceremonies/dresscode/|title=The Dress Code at the Nobel Banquet|work=Nobel Prize|publisher=Nobel Foundation|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Vienna Opera Ball]] in [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author-last=Blake|author-first=Matt|title=A fight at the Opera Ball!

In [[Scandinavia]] and the [[Netherlands]], white tie is the traditional attire for [[doctoral]] conferments and is prescribed at some Swedish and Finnish universities, where it is worn with a [[top hat]] variant called a [[doctoral hat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Degree conferment celebrations for new PhDs|work=Uppsala University|url=http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/conferment-ceremony/|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Degree Ceremonies 2006|work=University of Vaasa|url=http://lipas.uwasa.fi/promootio/en/dress.html|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author-first=Beth|author-last=Miller|title=A sword, a hat and three unforgettable days in Helsinki|work=Washington University in St Louis|date=31 August 2010|url=http://news.wustl.edu/news/Pages/21091.aspx|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ditzhuyzen|first1=Reinildis van|title=De Dikke Ditz: Hoe hoort het eigenlijk?|publisher=H.
