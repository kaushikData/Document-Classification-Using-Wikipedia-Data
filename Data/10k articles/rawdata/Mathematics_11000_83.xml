      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6105">'''Alhazen's problem''' is a problem in [[geometrical optics]] first formulated by [[Ptolemy]] in 150 AD.&lt;ref name=Weiss&gt;{{cite web | last=Weisstein | first=Eric | title=Alhazen's Billiard Problem  | publisher=[[Mathworld]] | url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/AlhazensBilliardProblem.html | accessdate=2008-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is named for the 11th-century Arab mathematician [[Alhazen]] (''Ibn al-Haytham'') who presented a geometric solution in his ''[[Book of Optics]]''. The algebraic solution involves [[quartic equation]]s and was found only as late as 1965, by Jack M. Elkin.

==Geometric formulation==
{{see|Geometrical optics}}
The problem comprises drawing lines from two points in a circle meeting at a third point on its [[circumference]] and making equal angles with the [[Surface normal|normal]] at that point. 
Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, "Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer." This leads to an [[Quartic equation|equation of the fourth degree]].&lt;ref name=MacTutor&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Al-Haytham|title=Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weiss/&gt;

==Alhazen's solution==
Ibn al-Haytham solved the problem using [[conic section]]s and a geometric proof.
He derived a formula for the sum of fourth powers, where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated.

His method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers, although he did not himself do this (perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in). 
He used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an [[Integral|integration]], where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a [[paraboloid]].&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;Victor J. Katz (1995), "Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India", ''Mathematics Magazine'''''68''' (3): 163–174 [165-9 &amp; 173-4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algebraic solution==
Later mathematicians such as [[Christiaan Huygens]], [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]], [[Guillaume de l'Hôpital]], [[Isaac Barrow]], and many others, attempted to find an algebraic solution to the problem, using various methods, including [[analytic geometry|analytic methods of geometry]] and derivation by [[complex number]]s.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = John D. | year = 1992 | title = The Remarkable Ibn al-Haytham | url = | journal = The Mathematical Gazette | volume = 76 | issue = 475| pages = 189–198 | doi=10.2307/3620392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An algebraic solution to the problem was finally found in 1965 by Jack M. Elkin, an actuarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Elkin|first=Jack M.|title=A deceptively easy problem|journal=Mathematics Teacher|volume=58|issue=3|pages=194–199|year=1965|jstor=27968003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other solutions were discovered in 1989, by Harald Riede&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Riede|first=Harald|title=Reflexion am Kugelspiegel. Oder: das Problem des Alhazen|journal=Praxis der Mathematik|volume=31|issue=2|pages=65–70|year=1989|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1997 by the [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] mathematician [[Peter M. Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Neumann|first=Peter M.|author-link=Peter M. Neumann|title=Reflections on Reflection in a Spherical Mirror|journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=105|issue=6|pages=523–528|year=1998|jstor=2589403|mr=1626185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Highfield |first=Roger |date=1 April 1997 |title=Don solves the last puzzle left by ancient Greeks |journal=[[Electronic Telegraph]] |volume=676 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1997/04/01/ngre01.html |accessdate=2008-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041123051228/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1997%2F04%2F01%2Fngre01.html |archivedate=November 23, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalization==
Recently, Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs researchers solved the extension of Alhazen's problem to general rotationally symmetric quadric mirrors including hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptical mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Agrawal |first=Amit |last2=Taguchi |first2=Yuichi |last3=Ramalingam |first3=Srikumar |year=2011 |title=Beyond Alhazen's Problem: Analytical Projection Model for Non-Central Catadioptric Cameras with Quadric Mirrors |publisher=IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition |url=http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~aagrawal/cvpr11/fp/fp.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307040949/http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~aagrawal/cvpr11/fp/fp.html |archivedate=2012-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They showed that the mirror reflection point can be computed by solving an eighth degree equation in the most general case. If the camera (eye) is placed on the axis of the mirror, the degree of the equation reduces to six.&lt;ref name=AgrawalECCV10&gt;{{Citation|last=Agrawal |first=Amit |last2=Taguchi |first2=Yuichi |last3=Ramalingam |first3=Srikumar |year=2010 |title=Analytical Forward Projection for Axial Non-Central Dioptric and Catadioptric Cameras |publisher=European Conference on Computer Vision |url=http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~aagrawal/eccv10/fp/fp.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307042704/http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~aagrawal/eccv10/fp/fp.html |archivedate=2012-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen's problem can also be extended to multiple refractions from a spherical ball. Given a light source and a spherical ball of certain refractive index, the closest point on the spherical ball where the light is refracted to the eye of the observer can be obtained by solving a tenth degree equation.&lt;ref name=AgrawalECCV10/&gt;

The theory of these figures was developed extensively by the ancient Greek mathematicians, surviving especially in works such as those of Apollonius of Perga. The conic sections pervade modern mathematics.]]

'''Apollonius of [[Perga]]''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀπολλώνιος ὁ Περγαῖος}}; {{lang-la|Apollonius Pergaeus}}; late 3rd{{snd}}early 2nd centuries BC) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[geometer]] and [[astronomer]] known for his theories on the topic of [[conic sections]]. Beginning from the theories of [[Euclid]] and [[Archimedes]] on the topic, he brought them to the state they were in just before the invention of [[analytic geometry]]. His definitions of the terms [[ellipse]], [[parabola]], and [[hyperbola]] are the ones in use today.

Apollonius worked on many other topics, including astronomy. Most of the work has not survived except in fragmentary references in other authors. His hypothesis of eccentric orbits to explain the apparently aberrant motion of the planets, commonly believed until the Middle Ages, was superseded during the Renaissance.

==Life==
For such an important contributor to the field of mathematics, scant biographical information remains. The 6th century Palestinian commentator, [[Eutocius of Ascalon]], on Apollonius’ major work, ''Conics'', states:&lt;ref&gt;Eutocius, ''Commentary on Conica'', Book I, Lines 5-10, to be found translated in {{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Thomas|1953|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Apollonius, the geometrician, ...  came from Perga in Pamphylia in the times of Ptolemy Euergetes, so records Herakleios the biographer of Archimedes ....”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Perga]] at the time was a Hellenized city of [[Pamphylia]] in [[Anatolia]]. The ruins of the city yet stand. It was a center of Hellenistic culture. Euergetes, “benefactor,” identifies [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]], third Greek dynast of Egypt in the diadochi succession. Presumably, his “times” are his regnum, 246-222/221 BC. Times are always recorded by ruler or officiating magistrate, so that if Apollonius was born earlier than 246, it would have been the “times” of Euergetes’ father. The identity of Herakleios is uncertain. The approximate times of Apollonius are thus certain, but no exact dates can be given.&lt;ref&gt;Studies on the dates of Apollonius are in essence a juggling of the dates of individuals mentioned by Apollonius and other ancient authors. There is the question of exactly what event occurred 246 - 222, whether birth or education. Scholars of the 19th and earlier 20th centuries tend to favor an earlier birth, 260 or 262, in an effort to make Apollonius more the age-mate of Archimedes. Some inscriptional evidence that turned up at Pompeii make Philonides the best dated character. He lived in the 2nd century BC. Since Apollonius' life must be extended into the 2nd century, early birth dates are less likely. A more detailed presentation of the data and problems may be found in {{cite book | title=The Ancient Tradition of Geometric Problems | first=Wilbur Richard | last=Knorr | location=Cambridge, MA | publisher=Birkhäuser Boston | year=1986 | chapter=The Successors of Archimedes in the Third Century}} The dichotomy between conventional dates deriving from tradition and a more realistic approach is shown by {{cite encyclopedia | title=Apollonius of Perga | encyclopedia=A to Z of Mathematicians | last=McElroy | first=Tucker | year=2005}} McElroy at once gives 262 - 190 (high-side dates) and explains that it should be late 3rd - early 2nd as it is in this article.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure  Specific birth and death years stated by the various scholars are only speculative.&lt;ref name=friedintro&gt;{{Harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|loc=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eutocius appears to associate Perga with the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] of Egypt. Never under Egypt, Perga in 246 BC belonged to the [[Seleucid Empire]], an independent [[diadochi]] state ruled by the Seleucid dynasty. During the last half of the 3rd century BC, Perga changed hands a number of times, being alternatively under the Seleucids and under the [[Kingdom of Pergamon]] to the north, ruled by the [[Attalid dynasty]]. Someone designated “of Perga” might well be expected to have lived and worked there. To the contrary, if Apollonius was later identified with Perga, it was not on the basis of his residence. The remaining autobiographical material implies that he lived, studied and wrote in Alexandria.

A letter by the Greek mathematician and astronomer [[Hypsicles]] was originally part of the supplement taken from Euclid's Book XIV, part of the thirteen books of Euclid's Elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The thirteen books of Euclid's Elements|author=Thomas Little Heath|url=https://archive.org/stream/thirteenbookseu03heibgoog#page/n521/mode/2up/search/Antiphon|year=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|"[[Basilides of Tyre]], O [[Protarchus]], when he came to Alexandria and met my father, spent the greater part of his sojourn with him on account of the bond between them due to their common interest in mathematics. And on one occasion, when looking into the tract written by Apollonius about the comparison of the [[dodecahedron]] and [[icosahedron]] inscribed in one and the same sphere, that is to say, on the question what ratio they bear to one another, they came to the conclusion that Apollonius' treatment of it in this book was not correct; accordingly, as I understood from my father, they proceeded to amend and rewrite it. But I myself afterwards came across another book published by Apollonius, containing a demonstration of the matter in question, and I was greatly attracted by his investigation of the problem. Now the book published by Apollonius is accessible to all; for it has a large circulation in a form which seems to have been the result of later careful elaboration."

"For my part, I determined to dedicate to you what I deem to be necessary by way of commentary, partly because you will be able, by reason of your proficiency in all mathematics and particularly in geometry, to pass an expert judgment upon what I am about to write, and partly because, on account of your intimacy with my father and your friendly feeling towards myself, you will lend a kindly ear to my disquisition. But it is time to have done with the preamble and to begin my treatise itself."}}

===The times of Apollonius===
Apollonius lived toward the end of a historical period now termed the [[Hellenistic Period]], characterized by the superposition of Hellenic culture over extensive non-Hellenic regions to various depths, radical in some places, hardly at all in others. The change was initiated by [[Philip II of Macedon]] and his son, [[Alexander the Great]], who, subjecting all of Greece is a series of stunning victories, went on to conquer the [[Persian Empire]], which ruled territories from Egypt to Pakistan. Philip was assassinated in 336 BC. Alexander went on to fulfill his plan by conquering the vast Persian empire.

===The short autobiography of Apollonius===
The material is located in the surviving false “Prefaces” of the books of his ''Conics.'' These are letters delivered to influential friends of Apollonius asking them to review the book enclosed with the letter. The Preface to Book I, addressed to one Eudemus, reminds him that ''Conics'' was initially requested by a house guest at Alexandria, the geometer, Naucrates, otherwise unknown to history. Naucrates had the first draft of all eight books in his hands by the end of the visit. Apollonius refers to them as being “without a thorough purgation” (''ou diakatharantes'' in Greek, ''ea non perpurgaremus'' in Latin). He intended to verify and emend the books, releasing each one as it was completed.

Hearing of this plan from Apollonius himself on a subsequent visit of the latter to Pergamon, Eudemus had insisted Apollonius send him each book before release. The circumstances imply that at this stage Apollonius was a young geometer seeking the company and advice of established professionals. Pappus states that he was with the students of [[Euclid]] at Alexandria. Euclid was long gone. This stay had been, perhaps, the final stage of Apollonius’ education. Eudemus was perhaps a senior figure in his earlier education at Pergamon; in any case, there is reason to believe that he was or became the head of the Library and Research Center ([[Museum]]) of Pergamon. Apollonius goes on to state that the first four books were concerned with the development of elements while the last four were concerned with special topics.

There is something of a gap between Prefaces I and II. Apollonius has sent his son, also Apollonius, to deliver II. He speaks with more confidence, suggesting that Eudemus use the book in special study groups, which implies that Eudemus was a senior figure, if not the headmaster, in the research center. Research in such institutions, which followed the model of the [[Lycaeum]] of [[Aristotle]] at Athens, due to the residency of [[Alexander the Great]] and his companions in its northern branch, was part of the educational effort, to which the library and museum were adjunct. There was only one such school in the state. Owned by the king, it was under royal patronage, which was typically jealous, enthusiastic, and participatory. The kings bought, begged, borrowed and stole the precious books whenever and wherever they could. Books were of the highest value, affordable only to wealthy patrons. Collecting them was a royal obligation. Pergamon was known for its parchment industry, whence “[[parchment]]” is derived from “Pergamon.”

Apollonius brings to mind [[Philonides of Laodicea]], a geometer whom he introduced to Eudemus in [[Ephesus]]. Philonides became Eudemus' student. He lived mainly in Syria during the 1st half of the 2nd century BC. Whether the meeting indicates that Apollonius now lived in Ephesus is unresolved. The intellectual community of the Mediterranean was international in culture. Scholars were mobile in seeking employment. They all communicated via some sort of postal service, public or private. Surviving letters are abundant. They visited each other, read each other's works, made suggestions to each other, recommended students and accumulated a tradition termed by some “the golden age of mathematics.”

Preface III is missing. During the interval Eudemus passed away, says Apollonius in IV, again supporting a view that Eudemus was senior over Apollonius. Prefaces IV–VII are more formal, omitting personal information and concentrating on summarizing the books. They are all addressed to a mysterious Attalus, a choice made “because”, as Apollonius writes to Attalus, “of your earnest desire to possess my works.” By that time a good many people at Pergamum had such a desire. Presumably, this Attalus was someone special, receiving copies of Apollonius’ masterpiece fresh from the author's hand. One strong theory is that Attalus is [[Attalus II Philadelphus]], 220-138 BC, general and defender of his brother's kingdom ([[Eumenes II]]), co-regent on the latter's illness in 160 BC, and heir to his throne and his widow in 158 BC. He and his brother were great patrons of the arts, expanding the library into international magnificence. The dates are consonant with those of Philonides, while Apollonius’ motive is consonant with Attalus' book-collecting initiative.

Apollonius sent to Attalus Prefaces V–VII. In Preface VII he describes Book VIII as “an appendix” ... “which I will take care to send you as speedily as possible.” There is no record that it was ever sent or ever completed. It may be missing from history because it was never in history, Apollonius having died before its completion.

== Documented works of Apollonius ==
Apollonius was a prolific geometer, turning out a large number of works. Only one survives, ''Conics''. It is a dense and extensive reference work on the topic, even by today's standards, serving as a repository of now little known geometric propositions as well as a vehicle for some new ones devised by Apollonius. Its audience was not the general population, which could not read or write. It was always intended for savants of mathematics and their small number of educated readers associated with the state schools and their associated libraries. It always was, in other words, a library reference work. Its basic definitions have become an important mathematical heritage. For the most part its methods and conclusions have been superseded by Analytic Geometry.

Of its eight books, only the first four have a credible claim to descent from the original texts of Apollonius. Books 5-7 have been translated from the Arabic into Latin. The original Greek has been lost. The status of Book VIII is unknown. A first draft existed. Whether the final draft was ever produced is not known. A "reconstruction" of it by Edmond Halley exists in Latin. There is no way to know how much of it, if any, is verisimilar to Apollonius. Halley also reconstructed ''De Rationis Sectione'' and ''De Spatii Sectione''. Beyond these works, except for a handful of fragments, documentation that might in any way be interpreted as descending from Apollonius ends.

Many of the lost works are described or mentioned by commentators. In addition are ideas attributed to Apollonius by other authors without documentation. Credible or not, they are hearsay. Some authors identify Apollonius as the author of certain ideas, consequently named after him. Others attempt to express Apollonius in modern notation or phraseology with indeterminate degrees of fidelity.

=== ''Conics'' ===
The Greek text of ''Conics'' uses the Euclidean arrangement of definitions, figures and their parts; i.e., the “givens,” followed by propositions “to be proved.” Books I-VII present 387 propositions. This type of arrangement can be seen in any modern geometry textbook of the traditional subject matter. As in any course of mathematics, the material is very dense and consideration of it, necessarily slow.  Apollonius had a plan for each book, which is partly described in the ''Prefaces''. The headings, or pointers to the plan, are somewhat in deficit, Apollonius having depended more on the logical flow of the topics.

An intellectual niche is thus created for the commentators of the ages. Each must present Apollonius in the most lucid and relevant way for his own times. They use a variety of methods: annotation, extensive prefatory material, different formats, additional drawings, superficial reorganization by the addition of capita, and so on. There are subtle variations in interpretation. The modern English speaker encounters a lack of material in English due to the preference for New Latin by English scholars. Such intellectual English giants as Edmund Halley and Isaac Newton, the proper descendants of the Hellenistic tradition of mathematics and astronomy,  can only be read and interpreted in translation by populations of English speakers unacquainted with the classical languages; that is, most of them.

Presentations written entirely in native English begin in the late 19th century. Of special note is Heath's ''Treatise on Conic Sections''. His extensive prefatory commentary includes such items as a lexicon of Apollonian geometric terms giving the Greek, the meanings, and usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|pp=clvii-clxx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting that “the apparently portentious bulk of the treatise has deterred many from attempting to make its acquaintance,”&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga||Heath|1896|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; he promises to add headings, changing the organization superficially, and to clarify the text with modern notation. His work thus references two systems of organization, his own and Apollonius’, to which concordances are given in parentheses.

Heath's work is indispensable. He taught throughout the early 20th century, passing away in 1940, but meanwhile another point of view was developing. [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)]], which had been a military school since colonial times, preceding the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland]], to which it is adjacent, in 1936 lost its accreditation and was on the brink of bankruptcy. In desperation the board summoned [[Stringfellow Barr]] and [[Scott Buchanan]] from the [[University of Chicago]], where they had been developing a new theoretical program for instruction of the Classics. Leaping at the opportunity, in 1937 they instituted the “new program” at St. John's, later dubbed the [[Great Books]] program, a fixed curriculum that would teach the works of select key contributors to the culture of western civilization. At St. John's, Apollonius came to be taught as himself, not as some adjunct to [[analytic geometry]].

The “tutor” of Apollonius was [[R. Catesby Taliaferro]], a new PhD in 1937 from the [[University of Virginia]]. He tutored until 1942 and then later for one year in 1948, supplying the English translations by himself, translating Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' and Apollonius’ ''Conics''. These translations became part of the Encyclopædia Britannica's [[Great Books of the Western World]] series. Only Books I-III are included, with an appendix for special topics. Unlike Heath, Taliaferro did not attempt to reorganize Apollonius, even superficially, or to rewrite him. His translation into modern English follows the Greek fairly closely. He does use modern geometric notation to some degree.

Contemporaneously with Taliaferro's work, [[Ivor Bulmer-Thomas|Ivor Thomas]] an Oxford don of the World War II era, was taking an intense interest in Greek mathematics. He planned a compendium of selections, which came to fruition during his military service as an officer in the [[Royal Norfolk Regiment]]. After the war it found a home in the [[Loeb Classical Library]], where it occupies two volumes, all translated by Thomas, with the Greek on one side of the page and the English on the other, as is customary for the Loeb series. Thomas' work has served as a handbook for the golden age of Greek mathematics. For Apollonius he only includes mainly those portions of Book I that define the sections.

Heath, Taliaferro, and Thomas satisfied the public demand for Apollonius in translation for most of the 20th century. The subject moves on. More recent translations and studies incorporate new information and points of view as well as examine the old.

====Book I====
[[File:Cono cortes 2.png|thumb|300px|Perspective illustration of one branch of a double cone showing the relevant planes: base, axial plane, of a circle, of an ellipse, of a parabola, of a hyperbola (only half is in this branch), the intersections of the latter two with the base, and the diameters of the sections.]]
Book I presents 58 propositions. Its most salient content is all the basic definitions concerning cones and conic sections. These definitions are not exactly the same as the modern ones of the same words. [[Etymology|Etymologically]] the modern words derive from the ancient, but the etymon often differs in meaning from its [[Linguistic reconstruction|reflex]].

A [[conical surface]] is generated by a [[line segment]] rotated about a [[bisection|bisector]] point such that the end points trace [[circle]]s, each in its own [[Plane (geometry)|plane]]. A [[cone]], one branch of the double conical surface, is the surface with the point ([[Apex (geometry)|apex]] or [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]]), the circle ([[Base (geometry)|base]]), and the axis, a line joining vertex and center of base.

A “[[Cross section (geometry)|section]]” (Latin sectio, Greek tome) is an imaginary “cutting”  of a cone by a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]].
* Proposition I.3: “If a cone is cut by a plane through the vertex, the section is a triangle.” In the case of a double cone, the section is two triangles such that the angles at the vertex are [[angle|vertical angles]].
* Proposition I.4 asserts that sections of a cone parallel to the base are circles with centers on the axis.&lt;ref&gt;Note that the Greek geometers were not defining the circle, the ellipse, and other figures as conic sections. This would be circular definition, as the cone was defined in terms of a circle. Each figure has its own geometric definition, and in addition, is being shown to be a conic section.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Proposition I.13 defines the ellipse, which is conceived as the cutting of a single cone by a plane inclined to the plane of the base and intersecting the latter in a line perpendicular to the diameter extended of the base outside the cone (not shown). The angle of the inclined plane must be greater than zero, or the section would be a circle. It must be less than the corresponding base angle of the axial triangle, at which the figure becomes a parabola. 
* Proposition I.11 defines a parabola. Its plane is parallel to a side in the conic surface of the axial triangle. 
* Proposition I.12 defines a hyperbola. Its plane is parallel to the axis. It cut both cones of the pair, thus acquiring two distinct branches (only one is shown).

The Greek geometers were interested in laying out select figures from their inventory in various applications of engineering and architecture, as the great inventors, such as Archimedes, were accustomed to doing. A demand for conic sections existed then and exists now. The development of mathematical characterization had moved geometry in the direction of [[Greek geometric algebra]], which visually features such algebraic fundamentals as assigning values to line segments as variables. They used a coordinate system intermediate between a grid of measurements and the [[Cartesian coordinate system]]. The theories of proportion and application of areas allowed the development of visual equations. (See below under Methods of Apollonius).

[[File:Parabola connection with areas of a square and a rectangle.gif|thumb|250px|The animated figure depicts the method of "application of areas" to express the mathematical relationship that characterizes a parabola. The upper left corner of the changing rectangle on the left side and the upper right corner on the right side is "any point on the section." The animation has it following the section. The orange square at the top is "the square on the distance from the point to the diameter; i.e., a square of the ordinate. In Apollonius, the orientation is horizontal rather than the vertical shown here. Here it is the square of the abscissa. Regardless of orientation, the equation is the same, names changed. The blue rectangle on the outside is the rectangle on the other coordinate and the distance p. In algebra, x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = py, one form of the equation for a parabola. If the outer rectangle exceeds py in area, the section must be a hyperbola; if it is less, an ellipse.]]
The “application of areas” implicitly asks, given an area and a line segment, does this area apply; that is, is it equal to, the square on the segment? If yes, an applicability (parabole) has been established. Apollonius followed Euclid in asking if a rectangle on the [[abscissa]] of any point on the section applies to the square of the [[ordinate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|p=c}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it does, his word-equation is the equivalent of

:{{math|y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} kx}}

which is one modern form of the equation for a [[parabola]]. The rectangle has sides k and x. It was he who accordingly named the figure, parabola, “application.”

The “no applicability” case is further divided into two possibilities. Given a function, f(x), such that, in the applicability case, {{math|y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} g(x)}}, in the no applicability case, either {{math|y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; g(x)}} or {{math|y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; g(x)}}. In the former, g(x) falls short of y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by a quantity termed the ellipsis, ”deficit.”  In the latter, g(x) overshoots by a quantity termed the hyperbole, “surfit.”

Applicability could be achieved by adding the deficit, {{math|y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} f(x) {{=}} g(x) + d}}, or subtracting the surfit, g(x) - s. The figure compensating for a deficit was named an ellipse; for a surfit, a hyperbola.&lt;ref&gt;Note that a circle, being another case of the deficit, is sometimes considered a kind of ellipse with a single center instead of two foci.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms of the modern equation depend on the translation and rotation of the figure from the origin, but the general equation for an ellipse,

:{{math|Ax&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + By&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} C}}

can be placed in the form

&lt;math&gt;y^2 {{=}} \left | \frac{{A}}{{B}}x^2\right | + \frac{{C}}{{B}}&lt;/math&gt;

where C/B is the d, while an equation for the hyperbola,

:{{math|Ax&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - By&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} C}}

becomes

&lt;math&gt;y^2 {{=}} \left | \frac{{A}}{{B}}x^2\right | - \frac{{C}}{{B}}&lt;/math&gt;

where C/B is the s.&lt;ref&gt;Note that y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = g(x) is not the equation for a parabola, which is y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = kx, the x being a lower power.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Book II====
Book II contains 53 propositions. Apollonius says that he intended to cover "the properties having to do with the diameters and axes and also the [[asymptotes]] and other things ... for limits of possibility." His definition of "diameter" is different from the traditional, as he finds it necessary to refer the intended recipient of the letter to his work for a definition. The elements mentioned are those that specify the shape and generation of the figures. [[Tangents]] are covered at the end of the book.

====Book III====
Book III contains 56 propositions. Apollonius claims original discovery for theorems "of use for the construction of solid loci ... the three-line and four-line [[Locus (mathematics)|locus]] ...." The locus of a conic section is the section. The three-line locus problem (as stated by Taliafero's appendix to Book III) finds "the locus of points whose distances from three given fixed straight lines ... are such that the square of one of the distances is always in a constant ratio to the rectangle contained by the other two distances." This is the proof of the application of areas resulting in the parabola.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}} The four-line problem results in the ellipse and hyperbola. Analytic geometry derives the same loci from simpler criteria supported by algebra, rather than geometry, for which Descartes was highly praised. He supersedes Apollonius in his methods.

====Book IV====
Book IV contains 57 propositions. The first sent to Attalus, rather than to Eudemus, it thus represents his more mature geometric thought. The topic is rather specialized: "the greatest number of points at which sections of a cone can meet one another, or meet a circumference of a circle, ...." Nevertheless, he speaks with enthusiasm, labeling them "of considerable use" in solving problems (Preface 4).&lt;ref&gt;Many of the commentators and translators, as well, no doubt, as copyists, have been explicitly less than enthusiastic about their use, especially after analytic geometry, which can do most of the problems by algebra without any stock of constructions. Taliaferro stops at Book III. Heath attempts a digest of the book to make it more palatable to the reader ({{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|loc=Intersecting Conics}}) Fried is more true to Apollonius, supplying an extensive critical apparatus instead ({{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Fried|2002|loc=Footnotes}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Book V====
Book V, known only through translation from the Arabic, contains 77 propositions, the most of any book.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cover the ellipse (50 propositions), the parabola (22), and the hyperbola (28).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are not explicitly the topic, which in Prefaces I and V Apollonius states to be maximum and minimum lines. These terms are not explained. In contrast to Book I, Book V contains no definitions and no explanation.

The ambiguity has served as a magnet to exegetes of Apollonius, who must interpret without sure knowledge of the meaning of the book's major terms. Until recently Heath's view prevailed: the lines are to be treated as normals to the sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apollonius of Pergas|Heath|1896|loc=Normals as Maxima and Minima}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] in this case is the [[perpendicular]] to a curve at a [[tangent point]] sometimes called the foot. If a section is plotted according to Apollonius’ coordinate system (see below under Methods of Apollonius), with the diameter (translated by Heath as the axis) on the x-axis and the vertex at the origin on the left, the phraseology of the propositions indicates that the minima/maxima are to be found between the section and the axis. Heath is led into his view by consideration of a fixed point p on the section serving both as tangent point and as one end of the line. The minimum distance between p and some point g on the axis must then be the normal from p.

In modern mathematics, normals to curves are known for being the location of the [[center of curvature]] of that small part of the curve located around the foot. The distance from the foot to the center is the [[radius of curvature]]. The latter is the [[radius]] of a circle, but for other than circular curves, the small [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] can be approximated by a circular arc. The curvature of non-circular curves; e.g., the conic sections, must change over the section. A map of the center of curvature; i.e., its locus, as the foot moves over the section, is termed the [[evolute]] of the section. Such a figure, the edge of the successive positions of a line, is termed an [[Envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] today. Heath believed that in Book V we are seeing Apollonius establish the logical foundation of a theory of normals, evolutes, and envelopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|loc=Propositions Leading Immediately to the Determination of the Evolute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heath's was accepted as the authoritative interpretation of Book V for the entire 20th century, but the changing of the century brought with it a change of view. In 2001, Apollonius scholars Fried &amp; Unguru, granting all due respect to other Heath chapters, balked at the historicity of Heath's analysis of Book V, asserting that he “reworks the original to make it more congenial to a modern mathematician ... this is the kind of thing that makes Heath’s work of dubious value for the historian, revealing more of Heath’s mind than that of Apollonius.”&lt;ref name=fried148&gt;{{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his arguments are in summary as follows. There is no mention of maxima/minima being per se normals in either the prefaces or the books proper.&lt;ref&gt;Normalis is a perfectly good Latin word meaning "measured with a norma," or square. Halley uses it to translate Pappus' eutheia, "right-placed," which has a more general sense of directionally right. For "the perpendicular to," the mathematical Greeks used "the normal of," where the object of "of" could be any figure, usually a straight line. What Fried is saying is that there was no standard use of normal to mean normal of a curve, nor did Apollonius introduce one, although in several isolated cases he did describe one.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of Heath's selection of 50 propositions said to cover normals, only 7, Book V: 27-33, state or imply maximum/minimum lines being perpendicular to the tangents. These 7 Fried classifies as isolated, unrelated to the main propositions of the book. They do not in any way imply that maxima/minima in general are normals. In his extensive investigation of the other 43 propositions, Fried proves that many cannot be.&lt;ref&gt;Fried &amp; Unguru dedicate an entire chapter to these criticisms:{{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|loc=Maximum and Minimum Lines: Book V of the Conica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fried and Unguru counter by portraying Apollonius as a continuation of the past rather than a foreshadowing of the future. First is a complete philological study of all references to minimum and maximum lines, which uncovers a standard phraseology. There are three groups of 20-25 propositions each.&lt;ref&gt;A summary table is given in {{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first group contains the phrase “from a point on the axis to the section,” which is exactly the opposite of a hypothetical “from a point on the section to the axis.” The former does not have to be normal to anything, although it might be. Given a fixed point on the axis, of all the lines connecting it to all the points of the section, one will be longest (maximum) and one shortest (minimum). Other phrases are “in a section,” “drawn from a section,” “cut off between the section and its axis,” cut off by the axis,” all referring to the same image.

In the view of Fried and Unguru, the topic of Book V is exactly what Apollonius says it is, maximum and minimum lines. These are not code words for future concepts, but refer to ancient concepts then in use. The authors cite Euclid, Elements, Book III, which concerns itself with circles, and maximum and minimum distances from interior points to the circumference.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fried|Unguru|2001|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without admitting to any specific generality they use terms such as “like” or “the analog of.” They are known for innovating the term “neusis-like.” A [[neusis construction]] was a method of fitting a given segment between two given curves. Given a point P, and a ruler with the segment marked off on it. one rotates the ruler around P cutting the two curves until the segment is fitted between them. In Book V, P is the point on the axis. Rotating a ruler around it, one discovers the distances to the section, from which the minimum and maximum can be discerned. The technique is not applied to the situation, so it is not neusis. The authors use neusis-like, seeing an archetypal similarity to  the ancient method.&lt;ref name=fried148/&gt;

====Book VI====
Book VI, known only through translation from the Arabic, contains 33 propositions, the least of any book. It also has large [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]], or gaps in the text, due to damage or corruption in the previous texts.

The topic is relatively clear and uncontroversial. Preface 1 states that it is “equal and similar sections of cones.” Apollonius extends the concepts of congruence and similarity presented by Euclid for more elementary figures, such as triangles, quadrilaterals, to conic sections. Preface 6 mentions “sections and segments” that are “equal and unequal” as well as “similar and dissimilar,” and adds some constructional information.

Book VI features a return to the basic definitions at the front of the book. “[[Extensionality|Equality]]” is determined by an application of areas. If one figure; that is, a section or a segment, is “applied” to another (Halley's ''si applicari possit altera super alteram''), they are “equal” (Halley's ''aequales'') if they coincide and no line of one crosses any line of the other. This is obviously a standard of [[congruence (geometry)|congruence]] following Euclid, Book I, Common Notions, 4: “and things coinciding (''epharmazanta'') with one another are equal (''isa'').” Coincidence and equality overlap, but they are not the same: the application of areas used to define the sections depends on quantitative equality of areas but they can belong to different figures.

Between instances that are the [[Identity (philosophy)|same]] (homos), being equal to each other, and those that are [[Difference (philosophy)|different]], or [[Inequality (mathematics)|unequal]], are figures that are “same-ish” (hom-oios), or [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]]. They are neither entirely the same nor different, but share aspects that are the same and do not share aspects that are different. Intuitively the geometricians had [[Scale (ratio)|scale]] in mind; e.g., a map is similar to a topographic region. Thus figures could have larger or smaller versions of themselves.

The aspects that are the same in similar figures depend on the figure. Book 6 of Euclid's Elements presents similar triangles as those that have the same corresponding angles. A triangle can thus have miniatures as small as you please, or giant versions, and still be “the same” triangle as the original.

In Apollonius' definitions at the beginning of Book VI, similar right cones have similar axial triangles. Similar sections and segments of sections are first of all in similar cones. In addition, for every abscissa of one must exist an abscissa in the other at the desired scale. Finally, abscissa and ordinate of one must be matched by coordinates of the same ratio of ordinate to abscissa as the other. The total effect is as though the section or segment were moved up and down the cone to achieve a different scale.&lt;ref&gt;A mathematical explanation as well as precis of each proposition in the book can be found in {{harvnb|Toomer|1990|pp=lxi-lxix}} Note that translations of the definitions vary widely as each English author attempts to paraphrase the complexities in clear and succinct English. In essence, no such English is available.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Book VII ====
Book VII, also a translation from the Arabic, contains 51 Propositions. These are the last that Heath considers in his 1896 edition. In Preface I, Apollonius does not mention them, implying that, at the time of the first draft, they may not have existed in sufficiently coherent form to describe. Apollonius uses obscure language, that they are “peri dioristikon theorematon”, which Halley translated as “de theorematis ad determinationem pertinentibus,” and Heath as “theorems involving determinations of limits.” This is the language of definition, but no definitions are forthcoming. Whether the reference might be to a specific kind of definition is a consideration but to date nothing credible has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;A summary of the question can be found at {{harvnb|Heath|1896|p=lxx}}. Most writers have something to say about it; for example, {{cite book | first=GJ | last=Toomer | year=1990 | title=Apollonius Conics Book V to VII: the Arabic Translation of the Lost Greek Original in the Version of the Banu Musa | volume=I | series=Sources in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences 9 | location=New York | publisher=Springer | pages=lxix-lxx | quote=we may regard the establishment of limits of solution as its main purpose}} Toomer’s view is given without specifics or reference to any text of Book VII except the Preface.&lt;/ref&gt; The topic of Book VII, completed toward the end of Apollonius’ life and career, is stated in Preface VII to be [[diameter]]s and “the figures described upon them,” which must include [[conjugate diameters]], as he relies heavily on them. In what way the term “limits” or “determinations” might apply is not mentioned.

Diameters and their conjugates are defined in Book I (Definitions 4-6). Not every diameter has a conjugate. The topography of a diameter (Greek diametros) requires a regular [[curve]]d [[shape|figure]]. Irregularly-shaped areas, addressed in modern times, are not in the ancient game plan. Apollonius has in mind, of course, the conic sections, which he describes in often convolute language: “a curve in the same plane” is a circle, ellipse or parabola, while “two curves in the same plane” is a hyperbola. A [[chord (geometry)|chord]] is a straight line whose two end points are on the figure; i.e., it cuts the figure in two places. If a grid of parallel chords is imposed on the figure, then the diameter is defined as the line bisecting all the chords, reaching the curve itself at a point called the vertex. There is no requirement for a closed figure; e.g., a parabola has a diameter.

A parabola has [[Symmetry (geometry)|symmetry]] in one dimension. If you imagine it folded on its one diameter, the two halves are congruent, or fit over each other. The same may be said of one branch of a hyperbola. Conjugate diameters (Greek suzugeis diametroi, where suzugeis is “yoked together”), however, are symmetric in two dimensions. The figures to which they apply require also an areal center (Greek kentron), today called a [[centroid]], serving as a center of symmetry in two directions. These figures are the circle, ellipse, and two-branched hyperbola. There is only one centroid, which must not be confused with the [[Focus (geometry)|foci]]. A diameter is a chord passing through the centroid, which always bisects it.

For the circle and ellipse, let a grid of parallel chords be superimposed over the figure such that the longest is a diameter and the others are successively shorter until the last is not a chord, but is a tangent point. The tangent must be parallel to the diameter. A conjugate diameter bisects the chords, being placed between the centroid and the tangent point. Moreover, both diameters are conjugate to each other, being called a conjugate pair. It is obvious that any conjugate pair of a circle are perpendicular to each other, but in an ellipse, only the major and minor axes are, the elongation destroying the perpendicularity in all other cases.

Conjugates are defined for the two branches of a [[hyperbola]] resulting from the cutting of a double cone by a single plane. They are called conjugate branches. They have the same diameter. Its centroid bisects the segment between vertices. There is room for one more diameter-like line: let a grid of lines parallel to the diameter cut both branches of the hyperbola. These lines are chord-like except that they do not terminate on the same continuous curve. A conjugate diameter can be drawn from the centroid to bisect the chord-like lines.

These concepts mainly from Book I get us started on the 51 propositions of Book VII defining in detail the relationships between sections, diameters, and conjugate diameters. As with some of Apollonius other specialized topics, their utility today compared to Analytic Geometry remains to be seen, although he affirms in Preface VII that they are both useful and innovative; i.e., he takes the credit for them.

=== Lost and reconstructed works described by Pappus ===
Pappus mentions other treatises of Apollonius:
# Λόγου ἀποτομή, ''De Rationis Sectione'' ("Cutting of a Ratio")
# Χωρίου ἀποτομή, ''De Spatii Sectione'' ("Cutting of an Area")
# Διωρισμένη τομή, ''De Sectione Determinata'' ("Determinate Section")
# Ἐπαφαί, ''De Tactionibus'' ("Tangencies")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mackenzie|first=Dana|date=|title=A Tisket, a Tasket, an Apollonian Gasket|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/a-tisket-a-tasket-an-apollonian-gasket/|journal=American Scientist|volume=98, January–February 2010|issue=1|pages=10–14|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Νεύσεις, ''De Inclinationibus'' ("Inclinations")
# Τόποι ἐπίπεδοι, ''De Locis Planis'' ("Plane Loci").
Each of these was divided into two books, and—with the ''Data'', the ''Porisms'', and ''Surface-Loci'' of Euclid and the ''Conics'' of Apollonius—were, according to Pappus, included in the body of the ancient analysis.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}} Descriptions follow of the six works mentioned above.

==== ''De Rationis Sectione'' ====
''De Rationis Sectione'' sought to resolve a simple problem: Given two straight lines and a point in each, draw through a third given point a straight line cutting the two fixed lines such that the parts intercepted between the given points in them and the points of intersection with this third line may have a given ratio.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}}

==== ''De Spatii Sectione'' ====
''De Spatii Sectione'' discussed a similar problem requiring the rectangle contained by the two intercepts to be equal to a given rectangle.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}}

In the late 17th century, [[Edward Bernard]] discovered a version of ''De Rationis Sectione'' in the [[Bodleian Library]]. Although he began a translation, it was Halley who finished it and included it in a 1706 volume with his restoration of ''De Spatii Sectione''.

==== ''De Sectione Determinata'' ====
''De Sectione Determinata'' deals with problems in a manner that may be called an analytic geometry of one dimension; with the question of finding points on a line that were in a ratio to the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |date=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=Apollonius of Perga |page=142|quote=The Apollonian treatise ''On Determinate Section'' dealt with what might be called an analytic geometry of one dimension. It considered the following general problem, using the typical Greek algebraic analysis in geometric form: Given four points A, B, C, D on a straight line, determine a fifth point P on it such that the rectangle on AP and CP is in a given ratio to the rectangle on BP and DP. Here, too, the problem reduces easily to the solution of a quadratic; and, as in other cases, Apollonius treated the question exhaustively, including the limits of possibility and the number of solutions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific problems are: Given two, three or four points on a straight line, find another point on it such that its distances from the given points satisfy the condition that the square on one or the rectangle contained by two has a given ratio either (1) to the square on the remaining one or the rectangle contained by the remaining two or (2) to the rectangle contained by the remaining one and another given straight line. Several have tried to restore the text to discover Apollonius's solution, among them Snellius ([[Willebrord Snell]], [[Leiden]], 1698); [[Alexander Anderson (mathematician)|Alexander Anderson]] of [[Aberdeen]], in the supplement to his ''Apollonius Redivivus'' (Paris, 1612); and [[Robert Simson]] in his ''Opera quaedam reliqua'' (Glasgow, 1776), by far the best attempt.{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}}

==== ''De Tactionibus'' ====

:''For more information, see [[Problem of Apollonius]].''

''De Tactionibus'' embraced the following general problem: Given three things (points, straight lines, or circles) in position, describe a circle passing through the given points and touching the given straight lines or circles. The most difficult and historically interesting case arises when the three given things are circles. In the 16th century, [[François Viète|Vieta]] presented this problem (sometimes known as the Apollonian Problem) to [[Adrianus Romanus]], who solved it with a [[hyperbola]]. Vieta thereupon proposed a simpler solution, eventually leading him to restore the whole of Apollonius's treatise in the small work ''Apollonius Gallus'' (Paris, 1600). The history of the problem is explored in fascinating detail in the preface to [[J. W. Camerer]]'s brief ''Apollonii Pergaei quae supersunt, ac maxime Lemmata Pappi in hos Libras, cum Observationibus, &amp;c'' (Gothae, 1795, 8vo).{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}}

==== ''De Inclinationibus'' ====
The object of ''De Inclinationibus'' was to demonstrate how a straight line of a given length, tending towards a given point, could be inserted between two given (straight or circular) lines. Though [[Marin Getaldić]] and [[Hugo d'Omerique]] (''Geometrical Analysis'', Cadiz, 1698) attempted restorations, the best is by Samuel Horsley (1770).{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}}

==== ''De Locis Planis'' ====
''De Locis Planis'' is a collection of propositions relating to loci that are either straight lines or circles. Since Pappus gives somewhat full particulars of its propositions, this text has also seen efforts to restore it, not only by [[P. Fermat]] (''Oeuvres'', i., 1891, pp.&amp;nbsp;3–51) and [[F. Schooten]] (Leiden, 1656) but also, most successfully of all, by R. Simson (Glasgow, 1749).{{sfn|Heath|1911|p=187}}

[[File:Conica of Apollonius of Perga fol. 162b and 164a.jpg|thumbnail|right|Pages from the 9th century Arabic translation of the ''Conics'']]
The early printed editions began for the most part in the 16th century. At that time, scholarly books were expected to be in Latin, today's [[New Latin]]. As almost no manuscripts were in Latin, the editors of the early printed works translated from the Greek or Arabic to Latin. The Greek and Latin were typically juxtaposed, but only the Greek is original, or else was restored by the editor to what he thought was original. Critical apparatuses were in Latin. The ancient commentaries, however, were in ancient or medieval Greek. Only in the 18th and 19th centuries did modern languages begin to appear. A representative list of early printed editions is given below. The originals of these printings are rare and expensive. For modern editions in modern languages see the references.

''De Sectione Rationis'' comes from an unpublished manuscript in Arabic in the [[Bodleian Library]] at Oxford originally partially translated by [[Edward Bernard]] but interrupted by his death. It was given to [[Edmond Halley]], professor, astronomer, mathematician and explorer, after whom [[Halley's Comet]] later was named. Unable to decipher the corrupted text, he abandoned it. Subsequently, [[David Gregory (mathematician)]] restored the Arabic for [[Henry Aldrich]], who gave it again to Halley. Learning Arabic, Halley created ''De Sectione Rationis'' and as an added emolument for the reader created a Neo-Latin translation of a version of ''De Sectione Spatii'' reconstructed from Pappus Commentary on it. The two Neo-Latin works and Pappus' ancient Greek commentary were bound together in the single volume of 1706. The author of the Arabic manuscript is not known. Based on a statement that it was written under the "auspices" of [[Al-Ma'mun]], Latin Almamon, astronomer and Caliph of Baghdad in 825, Halley dates it to 820 in his "Praefatio ad Lectorem."

The question of exactly what items are to be regarded as “faithful” pervades today's literature.&lt;/ref&gt; Books I-IV had never been lost. They appear with the Greek in one column and Halley's Latin in a parallel column. Books V-VI came from a windfall discovery of a previously unappreciated translation from Greek to Arabic that had been purchased by the antiquarian scholar [[Jacobus Golius]] in [[Aleppo]] in 1626. On his death in 1696 it passed by a chain of purchases and bequests to the Bodleian Library (originally as MS Marsh 607, dated 1070).&lt;ref&gt;For a more precise version of the chain see {{cite web | first=Colin | last=Wakefield | title=Arabic Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library | url=http://www.islamicmanuscripts.info/reference/books/Russell-1994-Arabick/Russell-1994-Arabick-128-146-Wakefield.pdf | pages=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The translation, dated much earlier, comes from the branch of Almamon's school entitled the [[Banū Mūsā]], “sons of Musa,” a group of three brothers, who lived in the 9th century. The translation was performed by writers working for them.&lt;ref name=friedintro/&gt; In Halley's work, only the Latin translation of Books V-VII is given. This is its first printed publication. Book VIII was lost before the scholars of Almamon could take a hand at preserving it. Halley's concoction, based on expectations developed in Book VII, and the lemmas of Pappus, is given in Latin. The commentaries of Pappus, Serenus and Eutocius are included as a guide to the interpretation of the ''Conics''.

== Ideas attributed to Apollonius by other writers ==

=== Apollonius' failed astronomy ===
The [[hypothesis]] of eccentric [[orbit]]s, or equivalently, [[deferent and epicycle]]s, to explain the apparent motion of the planets and the varying speed of the [[Moon]], is also attributed to him. Ptolemy describes [[Apollonius' theorem]] in the ''[[Almagest]]'' XII.1.

=== Methods of Apollonius ===
According to Heath,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|p=ci}}&lt;/ref&gt; “The Methods of Apollonius” were not his and were not personal. Whatever influence he had on later theorists was that of geometry, not of his own innovation of technique. Heath says, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;“As a preliminary to the consideration in detail of the methods employed in the Conics, it may be stated generally that they follow steadily the accepted principles of geometrical investigation which found their definitive expression in the Elements of Euclid.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With regard to moderns speaking of golden age geometers, the term "method" means specifically the visual, reconstructive way in which the geometer unknowingly produces the same result as an algebraic method used today. As a simple example, algebra finds the area of a square by squaring its side. The geometric method of accomplishing the same result is to construct a visual square. Geometric methods in the golden age could produce most of the results of elementary algebra.

====Geometrical algebra====
[[File:Пифагоровы штаны.png|thumb|200px|left|Visual form of the Pythagorean theorem as the ancient Greeks saw it. The blue square is the sum of the other two squares.]]
Heath goes on to use the term [[Greek geometric algebra|geometrical algebra]] for the methods of the entire golden age. The term is “not inappropriately” called that, he says. Today the term has been resurrected for use in other senses (see under [[geometric algebra]]). Heath was using it as it had been defined by [[Henry Burchard Fine]] in 1890 or before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Fine | first=Henry B | authorlink=Henry Burchard Fine | year=1902 | title=The number-system of algebra treated theoretically and historically | location=Boston | publisher=Leach | pages=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fine applies it to [[La Géométrie]] of [[René Descartes]], the first full-blown work of [[analytic geometry]]. Establishing as a precondition that “two algebras are formally identical whose fundamental operations are formally the same,” Fine says that Descartes’ work “is not ... mere numerical algebra, but what may for want of a better name be called the algebra of line segments. Its symbolism is the same as that of numerical algebra; ....”

For example, in Apollonius a line segment AB (the line between Point A and Point B) is also the numerical length of the segment. It can have any length. AB therefore becomes the same as an [[Variable (mathematics)|algebraic variable]], such as x (the unknown), to which any value might be assigned; e.g., x=3.

Variables are defined in Apollonius by such word statements as “let AB be the distance from any point on the section to the diameter,” a practice that continues in algebra today. Every student of basic algebra must learn to convert “word problems” to algebraic variables and equations, to which the rules of algebra apply in solving for x. Apollonius had no such rules. His solutions are geometric.

Relationships not readily amenable to pictorial solutions were beyond his grasp; however, his repertory of pictorial solutions came from a pool of complex geometric solutions generally not known (or required) today. One well-known exception is the indispensable [[Pythagorean Theorem]], even now represented by a right triangle with squares on its sides illustrating an expression such as a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The Greek geometers called those terms “the square on AB,” etc. Similarly, the area of a rectangle formed by AB and CD was "the rectangle on AB and CD."

These concepts gave the Greek geometers algebraic access to [[Linear equation|linear functions]] and [[quadratic functions]], which latter the conic sections are. They contain [[Exponentiation|powers]] of 1 or 2 respectively. Apollonius had not much use for cubes (featured in [[solid geometry]]), even though a cone is a solid. His interest was in conic sections, which are plane figures. Powers of 4 and up were beyond visualization, requiring a degree of abstraction not available in geometry, but ready at hand in algebra.

====The coordinate system of Apollonius====
[[File:Cartesian-coordinate-system Oxy P.svg|thumb|200px|Cartesian coordinate system, standard in analytic geometry]]
All ordinary measurement of length in public units, such as inches, using standard public devices, such as a ruler, implies public recognition of a [[Regular grid|Cartesian grid]]; that is, a surface divided into unit squares, such as one square inch, and a space divided into unit cubes, such as one cubic inch. The [[ancient Greek units of measurement]] had provided such a grid to Greek mathematicians since the Bronze Age. 
Prior to Apollonius, [[Menaechmus]] and [[Archimedes]] had already started locating their figures on an implied window of the common grid by referring to distances conceived to be measured from a left-hand vertical line marking a low measure and a bottom horizontal line marking a low measure, the directions being rectilinear, or perpendicular to one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|p=cxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; These edges of the window become, in the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], the axes. One specifies the rectilinear distances of any point from the axes as the [[coordinates]]. The ancient Greeks did not have that convention. They simply referred to distances.

Apollonius does have a standard window in which he places his figures. Vertical measurement is from a horizontal line he calls the “diameter.”  The word is the same in Greek as it is in English, but the Greek is somewhat wider in its comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius, ''Conics'', Book I, Definition 4. Refer also to {{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|p=clxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the figure of the conic section is cut by a grid of parallel lines, the diameter bisects all the line segments included between the branches of the figure. It must pass through the vertex (koruphe, "crown"). A diameter thus comprises open figures such as a parabola as well as closed, such as a circle. There is no specification that the diameter must be perpendicular to the parallel lines, but Apollonius uses only rectilinear ones.

The rectilinear distance from a point on the section to the diameter is termed tetagmenos in Greek, etymologically simply “extended.”  As it is only ever extended “down” (kata-) or “up” (ana-), the translators interpret it as [[ordinate]]. In that case the diameter becomes the x-axis and the vertex the origin. The y-axis then becomes a tangent to the curve at the vertex. The [[abscissa]] is then defined as the segment of the diameter between the ordinate and the vertex.

Using his version of a coordinate system, Apollonius manages to develop in pictorial form the geometric equivalents of the equations for the conic sections, which raises the question of whether his coordinate system can be considered Cartesian. There are some differences. The Cartesian system is to be regarded as universal, covering all figures in all space applied before any calculation is done. It has four quadrants divided by the two crossed axes. Three of the quadrants include negative coordinates meaning directions opposite the reference axes of zero.

Apollonius has no negative numbers, does not explicitly have a number for zero, and does not develop the coordinate system independently of the conic sections. He works essentially only in Quadrant 1, all positive coordinates. Carl Boyer, a modern historian of mathematics, therefore says:&lt;ref name="Boyer Apollonius"&gt;{{cite book |first=Carl B. | last=Boyer | authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer | title=A History of Mathematics | edition=Second | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | date=1991 | isbn=0-471-54397-7| chapter=Apollonius of Perga | pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;”However, Greek geometric algebra did not provide for negative magnitudes; moreover, the coordinate system was in every case superimposed ''a posteriori'' upon a given curve in order to study its properties .... Apollonius, the greatest geometer of antiquity, failed to develop analytic geometry....’’&lt;/blockquote&gt;

No one denies, however, that Apollonius occupies some sort of intermediate niche between the grid system of conventional measurement and the fully developed Cartesian Coordinate System of Analytic Geometry. In reading Apollonius, one must take care not to assume modern meanings for his terms.

====The theory of proportions====
{{main article|Ratio|Proportionality (mathematics)|Magnitude (mathematics)|Fraction (mathematics)|Eudoxus of Cnidus}}
Apollonius uses the "Theory of Proportions" as expressed in [[Euclid]]’s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', Books 5 and 6. Devised by Eudoxus of Cnidus, the theory is intermediate between purely graphic methods and modern number theory. A standard decimal number system is lacking, as is a standard treatment of fractions. The propositions, however, express in words rules for manipulating fractions in arithmetic. Heath proposes that they stand in place of multiplication and division.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Apollonius of Perga|Heath|1896|pp=ci – cii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the term “magnitude”  Eudoxus hoped to go beyond numbers to a general sense of size, a meaning it still retains. With regard to the figures of Euclid, it most often means numbers, which was the Pythagorean approach. [[Pythagoras]] believed the universe could be characterized by quantities, which belief has become the current scientific dogma. Book V of Euclid begins by insisting that a magnitude (megethos, “size”) must be divisible evenly into units (meros, “part”). A magnitude is thus a multiple of units. They do not have to be standard measurement units, such as meters or feet. One unit can be any designated line segment.

There follows perhaps the most useful fundamental definition ever devised in science: the ratio (Greek [[logos]], meaning roughly “explanation.”) is a statement of relative magnitude. Given two magnitudes, say of segments AB and CD. the ratio of AB to CD, where CD is considered unit, is the number of CD in AB; for example, 3 parts of 4, or 60 parts per million, where [[Parts-per notation|ppm]] still uses the “parts” terminology. The ratio is the basis of the modern fraction, which also still means “part,” or “fragment”,  from the same Latin root as fracture.
The ratio is the basis of mathematical prediction in the logical structure called a “proportion”  (Greek analogos). The proportion states that if two segments, AB and CD, have the same ratio as two others, EF and GH, then AB and CD are proportional to EF and GH, or, as would be said in Euclid, AB is to CD as EF is to GH.

Algebra reduces this general concept to the expression AB/CD = EF/GH. Given any three of the terms, one can calculate the fourth as an unknown. Rearranging the above equation, one obtains AB = (CD/GH)•EF, in which, expressed as y = kx, the CD/GH is known as the “constant of proportionality.” The Greeks had little difficulty with taking multiples (Greek pollaplasiein), probably by successive addition.

Apollonius uses ratios almost exclusively of line segments and areas, which are designated by squares and rectangles. The translators have undertaken to use the colon notation introduced by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]'', 1684.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A history of mathematical notations | first=Florian | last=Cajori | location=New York | publisher=Dover Publications | year=1993 | page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here is an example from ''Conics'', Book I, on Proposition 11:

:Literal translation of the Greek: Let it be contrived that the (square) of BC be to the (rectangle) of BAC as FH is to FA
:Taliaferro’s translation: “Let it be contrived that sq. BC : rect. BA.AC :: FH : FA”
:Algebraic equivalent: BC&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/BA•BC = FH/FA

He is known for [[mental math]] capabilities and "[[mathemagician|Mathemagics]]" performances in front of live audiences. His mathematical abilities have been highlighted in newspaper and magazine articles, at [[TED Talks]] and on the [[Colbert Report]].

==Education==
Benjamin earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree with highest honors in applied mathematics at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in 1983. He then went on to receive a [[Master of Science]] degree in 1985 and a [[Doctorate of Philosophy]] in engineering in mathematical sciences at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1989. His PhD dissertation was titled "Turnpike Structures for Optimal Maneuvers", and was supervised by [[Alan J. Goldman]].&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.math.hmc.edu/~benjamin/benjamin.info.html | title=Curriculum Vitae: Arthur T. Benjamin | publisher=Harvey Mudd College | accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his freshman year at CMU he wrote the lyrics and created the magic effects for the musical comedy, ''Kije!'', in collaboration with author Scott McGregor and composer Arthur Darrell Turner. This musical was the winner of an annual competition and was first performed as the CMU's Spring Musical in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smcgregor.com/kije/|title=Kije!

==Career==
===Academic===
[[File:Arthur Benjamin Washington 2009.jpg|thumb|Arthur Benjamin at the Joint Mathematics Meetings in [[Washington, DC]], January 2009.]]
Benjamin held several mathematics positions while attending university, including stints with the [[National Bureau of Standards]], the [[National Security Agency]], and the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]]. Upon receipt of his PhD he was hired as an assistant professor of mathematics at Harvey Mudd College. He is currently a full professor at Harvey Mudd and was [[chairman|chair]] of the mathematics department from 2002 to 2004. He has published over 90 academic papers and five books.&lt;ref name=CV /&gt; He has also filmed several sets of lectures on mathematical topics for [[The Great Courses]] series from [[The Teaching Company]], including a course on Discrete Mathematics, Mental Math, and The Mathematics of Games and Puzzles: From Cards to Sudoku. He served as co-editor of ''[[Math Horizons]]'' magazine for five years.&lt;ref name="TGC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=328 | title=Professor Arthur T.

===Mathemagics===
[[File:LightningFastCalculatorBeatsElectronicCalculator.jpg|left|thumb|Arthur Benjamin performs at the 1983 [[CSICOP]] Conference in [[Buffalo, NY]].]]
Benjamin has long had an interest in [[magic (illusion)|magic]]. While in college he honed his skills as a magician and attended magic conferences. At one of these conferences he met well-known magician and [[skeptic]] [[James Randi]], who greatly influenced Benjamin's decision to perform Mathemagics shows for live audiences. Randi invited him to perform his mathematical tricks on a television program called ''Exploring Psychic Powers Live'', co-hosted by [[Uri Geller]]. Randi also encouraged Benjamin to become involved in the growing skeptical movement. He attended early meetings of the Southern California Skeptics in the 1990s, which later evolved into the [[Skeptics Society]]. It was at these meetings that he met Skeptics Society President [[Michael Shermer]], who would later become a co-author on three of Benjamin's books.&lt;ref name="MTS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://meettheskeptics.libsyn.com/mts-meet-arthur-benjamin | title=MTS: Meet Arthur Benjamin | work=Meet the Skeptics! | date=20 March 2011 | accessdate=13 January 2014 | author=Brown, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benjamin regularly performs his Mathemagics program for live audiences at schools, colleges, conferences, and even at [[The Magic Castle]] in [[Hollywood, California]].&lt;ref name="Perform"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.math.hmc.edu/~benjamin/mathemagics/performances.html | title=Recent &amp; Upcoming Performances | publisher=Harvey Mudd College | work=Arthur Benjamin: The Art of Mental Calculation | accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These shows feature Benjamin performing mathematical feats like rapidly [[squaring]] numbers with up to five digits and correctly identifying the day of the week on which audience members were born based on their birth dates.&lt;ref name="TEDmagic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ted.com/talks/arthur_benjamin_does_mathemagic.html | title=Arthur Benjamin Does Mathemagic | publisher=TED | work=TED Talks | date=December 2007 | accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also featured in ''Mathemagics'', a multimedia disc released for the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]] in 1994, which consists largely of short demonstrations and lessons by Benjamin in mental math and mathemagics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Mathemagics|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=70 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1995|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1345">In a [[technical drawing]], a '''basic dimension''' is a theoretically exact dimension, given from a datum to a feature of interest.  In [[Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing]],  basic dimensions are defined as a numerical value used to describe the theoretically exact size, profile, orientation or location of a feature or datum target.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;ASME Y14.5M-1994 Dimensioning and Tolerancing&lt;/ref&gt; 

Allowable variations from the theoretically exact geometry are indicated by feature control frames, notes, and tolerances '''on other non-basic dimensions'''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Basic dimensions are currently denoted by enclosing the number of the dimension in a [[rectangle]].

In earlier times, they were denoted by appending "BASIC" or "BSC" to the dimension&lt;ref&gt;Tool and Manufacturing Engineers Handbook Desk Edition, Volume 5, 9-1&lt;/ref&gt;

When features are located using BASIC dimensions by chain dimensioning, there is no accumulation of tolerance between features, because the dimensions refer to the theoretically perfect position of the feature, not the actual location of the feature within the range permitted by tolerances.&lt;ref&gt;Tool and Manufacturing Engineers Handbook Desk Edition, Volume 5, 9-1&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3309">The '''Bateman Manuscript Project''' was a major effort at collation and encyclopedic compilation of the mathematical theory of [[special functions]]. It resulted in the eventual publication of five important reference volumes, under the editorship of [[Arthur Erdélyi]].

==Overview==
The theory of special functions was a core activity of the field of [[applied mathematics]], from the middle of the nineteenth century to the advent of high-speed [[electronic computing]]. The intricate properties of [[spherical harmonics]], [[elliptic function]]s and other staples of problem-solving in [[mathematical physics]], [[astronomy]] and right across the [[physical sciences]], are not easy to document completely, absent a theory explaining the inter-relationships. [[Mathematical table]]s to perform actual calculations needed to mesh with an adequate theory of how functions could be transformed into those already tabulated.

[[Harry Bateman]], a distinguished applied mathematician, undertook the somewhat [[Quixotism|quixotic]] task of trying to collate the content of the very large literature. On his death in 1946, his papers on this project were still in a uniformly rough state. The publication of the edited version provided special functions texts more up-to-date than, for example, the classic [[Whittaker &amp; Watson]].

The volumes were out of print for many years, and copyright in the works reverted to the [[California Institute of Technology]], who renewed them in the early 1980s.  [[Dover Publications|Dover]] planned to  reprint them for publication in 2007 but this never occurred {{Citation needed|reason=Is there any written statement on this plan?.|date=October 2016}}.  In 2011, the California Institute of Technology gave permission for scans of the volumes to be made publicly available (see References).

Other mathematicians involved in the project include [[Wilhelm Magnus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16697">[[File:Beta-skeleton.svg|thumb|300px|The circle-based 1.1-skeleton (heavy dark edges) and 0.9-skeleton (light dashed blue edges) of a set of 100 random points in a square.]]
In [[computational geometry]] and [[geometric graph theory]], a '''''β''-skeleton''' or '''beta skeleton''' is an [[undirected graph]] defined from a set of points in the [[Euclidean plane]]. Two points ''p'' and ''q'' are connected by an edge whenever all the angles ''prq'' are sharper than a threshold determined from the numerical parameter&amp;nbsp;''β''.

==Circle-based definition==
[[File:Beta-skeleton regions.svg|thumb|The empty regions ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''pq''&lt;/sub&gt; defining the circle-based ''β''-skeleton. Left: ''β''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1. Center: ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. Right: ''β''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.]]
Let ''β'' be a positive [[real number]], and calculate an angle ''θ'' using the formulas

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \begin{cases} \sin^{-1} \frac{1}{\beta}, &amp; \text{if }\beta \ge 1 \\ \pi - \sin^{-1}{\beta}, &amp; \text{if }\beta\le 1\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

For any two points ''p'' and ''q'' in the plane, let ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''pq''&lt;/sub&gt; be the set of points for which angle ''prq'' is greater than&amp;nbsp;''θ''. Then ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''pq''&lt;/sub&gt; takes the form of a union of two open disks with diameter ''βd''(''p'',''q'') for ''β''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1 and ''θ''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;π/2, and it takes the form of the intersection of two open disks with diameter ''d''(''p'',''q'')/''β'' for ''β''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1 and ''θ''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;π/2. When ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 the two formulas give the same value ''θ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;π/2, and ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''pq''&lt;/sub&gt; takes the form of a single open disk with ''pq'' as its diameter.

The ''β''-skeleton of a [[Isolated point|discrete set]] ''S'' of points in the plane is the [[undirected graph]] that connects two points ''p'' and ''q'' with an edge ''pq'' whenever ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''pq''&lt;/sub&gt; contains no points of ''S''. That is, the ''β''-skeleton is the empty region graph defined by the regions ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''pq''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="ccl"&gt;{{harvtxt|Cardinal|Collette|Langerman|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When ''S'' contains a point ''r'' for which angle ''prq'' is greater than ''θ'', then ''pq'' is not an edge of the ''β''-skeleton; the ''β''-skeleton consists of those pairs ''pq'' for which no such point ''r'' exists.

==Lune-based definition==
Some authors use an alternative definition in which the empty regions ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''pq''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''β''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 are not unions of two disks but rather [[Lens (geometry)|lenses]] (more often called in this context "[[Lune (mathematics)|lunes]]"), intersections of two congruent disks with diameter ''βd''(''pq''), such that line segment ''pq'' lies on a radius of both disks and such that the points ''p'' and ''q'' both lie on the boundary of the intersection. As with the circle-based ''β''-skeleton, the lune-based ''β''-skeleton has an edge ''pq'' whenever region ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''pq''&lt;/sub&gt; is empty of other input points. For this alternative definition, the [[relative neighborhood graph]] is a special case of a ''β''-skeleton with ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. The two definitions coincide for ''β''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1, and for larger values of ''β'' the circle-based skeleton is a [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] of the lune-based skeleton.

One important difference between the circle-based and lune-based ''β''-skeletons is that, for any point set that does not lie on a single line, there always exists a sufficiently large value of ''β'' such that the circle-based ''β''-skeleton is the [[empty graph]]. In contrast, if a pair of points ''p'' and ''q'' has the property that, for all other points ''r'', one of the two angles ''pqr'' and ''qpr'' is obtuse, then the lune-based ''β''-skeleton will contain edge ''pq'' no matter how large ''β'' is.

==History==
''β''-skeletons were first defined by {{harvtxt|Kirkpatrick|Radke|1985}} as a [[Scale invariance|scale-invariant]] variation of the [[alpha shape]]s of {{harvtxt|Edelsbrunner|Kirkpatrick|Seidel|1983}}. The name, "''β''-skeleton", reflects the fact that in some sense the ''β''-skeleton describes the shape of a set of points in the same way that a [[topological skeleton]] describes the shape of a two-dimensional region. Several generalizations of the ''β''-skeleton to graphs defined by other empty regions have also been considered.&lt;ref name="ccl"/&gt;&lt;ref name="v"/&gt;

==Properties==
If ''β'' varies continuously from 0 to ∞, the circle-based ''β''-skeletons form a sequence of graphs extending from the [[complete graph]] to the [[empty graph]]. The special case ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 leads to the [[Gabriel graph]], which is known to contain the [[Euclidean minimum spanning tree]]; therefore, the ''β''-skeleton also contains the Gabriel graph and the minimum spanning tree whenever ''β''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1.

For any constant ''β'', a [[fractal]] construction resembling a flattened version of the [[Koch snowflake]] can be used to define a sequence of point sets whose ''β''-skeletons are paths of arbitrarily large length within a unit square. Therefore, unlike the closely related [[Delaunay triangulation]], ''β''-skeletons have unbounded [[stretch factor]] and are not [[geometric spanner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Eppstein|2002}}; {{harvtxt|Bose|Devroye|Evans|Kirkpatrick|2002}}; {{harvtxt|Wang|Li|Moaveninejad|Wang|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algorithms==
A [[naïve algorithm]] that tests each triple ''p'', ''q'', and ''r'' for membership of ''r'' in the region ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''pq''&lt;/sub&gt; can construct the ''β''-skeleton of any set of ''n'' points in time O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

When ''β''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;1, the ''β''-skeleton (with either definition) is a subgraph of the Gabriel graph, which is a subgraph of the [[Delaunay triangulation]]. If ''pq'' is an edge of the Delaunay triangulation that is not an edge of the ''β''-skeleton, then a point ''r'' that forms a large angle ''prq'' can be found as one of the at most two points forming a triangle with ''p'' and ''q'' in the Delaunay triangulation. Therefore, for these values of ''β'', the circle-based ''β''-skeleton for a set of ''n'' points can be constructed in time O(''n''&amp;nbsp;log&amp;nbsp;''n'') by computing the Delaunay triangulation and using this test to filter its edges.&lt;ref name="v"&gt;{{harvtxt|Veltkamp|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''β''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;1, a different algorithm of {{harvtxt|Hurtado|Liotta|Meijer|2003}} allows the construction of the ''β''-skeleton in time O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). No better worst-case time bound is possible because, for any fixed value of ''β'' smaller than one, there exist point sets in general position (small perturbations of a [[regular polygon]]) for which the ''β''-skeleton is a [[complete graph]] with a quadratic number of edges. In the same quadratic time bound, the entire ''β''-spectrum (the sequence of circle-based ''β''-skeletons formed by varying ''β'') may also be calculated.

==Applications==
The circle-based ''β''-skeleton may be used in [[image analysis]] to reconstruct the shape of a two-dimensional object, given a set of sample points on the boundary of the object (a computational form of the [[connect the dots]] puzzle where the sequence in which the dots are to be connected must be deduced by an algorithm rather than being given as part of the puzzle). Although, in general, this requires a choice of the value of the parameter ''β'', it is possible to prove that the choice ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.7 will correctly reconstruct the entire boundary of any smooth surface, and not generate any edges that do not belong to the boundary, as long as the samples are generated sufficiently densely relative to the local [[curvature]] of the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Amenta|Bern|Eppstein|1998}}; {{harvtxt|O'Rourke|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However in experimental testing a lower value, ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.2, was more effective for reconstructing street maps from sets of points marking the center lines of streets in a [[geographic information system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Radke|Flodmark|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For generalizations of the ''β''-skeleton technique to reconstruction of surfaces in three dimensions, see {{harvtxt|Hiyoshi|2007}}.

Circle-based ''β''-skeletons have been used to find subgraphs of the [[minimum weight triangulation]] of a point set: for sufficiently large values of ''β'', every ''β''-skeleton edge can be guaranteed to belong to the minimum weight triangulation. If the edges found in this way form a [[connected graph]] on all of the input points, then the remaining minimum weight triangulation edges may be found in [[polynomial time]] by [[dynamic programming]]. However, in general the minimum weight triangulation problem is NP-hard, and the subset of its edges found in this way may not be connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Keil|1994}}; {{harvtxt|Cheng|Xu|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''β''-skeletons have also been applied in [[machine learning]] to solve geometric [[Statistical classification|classification]] problems&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Zhang|King|2002}}; {{harvtxt|Toussaint|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[wireless ad hoc network]]s as a mechanism for controlling communication complexity by choosing a subset of the pairs of wireless stations that can communicate with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Bhardwaj|Misra|Xue|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parametrized proximity graphs based ''β''-skeletons are to be applied in [[visual perception]] and [[pattern recognition]] also used to find family of proximity graphs, geometric graphs in which two vertices are connected with an edge if and only if they satisfy particular geometric requirements. For β-skeletons such edge between points v1 and v2 exists if no point from a given set lies inside a set called β-neighborhood (β-lune, respectively) of v1 and v2. &lt;ref&gt; {{ harvtxt|Majewska.G.| β-skeletons-proximity graphs| 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12948">In [[mathematics]], '''Bhargava's factorial function''', or simply '''Bhargava factorial''',  is a certain generalization of the [[factorial]] function developed by the [[Fields Medal]] winning mathematician [[Manjul Bhargava]] as part of his thesis in [[Harvard University]] in 1996. The Bhargava factorial has the property that many [[number theory|number-theoretic]] results involving the ordinary factorials remain true even when the factorials are replaced by the Bhargava factorials. Using an arbitrary [[infinite set|infinite subset]] ''S'' of the set ''Z'' of integers, Bhargava associated a positive integer with every positive integer ''k'', which he denoted by ''k'' !&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, with the property that if we take ''S'' = ''Z'' itself, then the integer associated with ''k'', that is ''k'' !&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt;, would turn out to be the ordinary factorial of ''k''.

==Motivation for the generalization==
The [[factorial]] of a [[non-negative integer]] ''n'', denoted by ''n''!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to ''n''. For example, 5! = 5×4×3×2×1 = 120. By convention, the value of 0! is defined as 1. This  classical factorial function appears prominently in many theorems in [[number theory]]. The following are a few of these theorems.&lt;ref name=MAA/&gt;

# For any positive integers ''k'' and ''l'', (''k'' + ''l'')! is a multiple of ''k''! ''l''!.
# Let ''f''(''x'') be a primitive [[integer polynomial]], that is, a polynomial in which the coefficients are integers and are [[relatively prime]] to each other. If the degree of ''f''(''x'') is ''k'' then the [[greatest common divisor]] of the set of values of ''f''(''x'') for integer values of ''x'' is a [[divisor]] of ''k''!.
# Let ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, . . . , ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; be any ''n'' + 1 integers. Then the product of their pairwise differences is a multiple of 0! 1! ... ''n''!.
# Let ''Z'' be the set of integers and ''n'' any integer. Then the number of [[polynomial function]]s from the [[ring of integers]]  ''Z'' to the [[quotient ring]]  ''Z''/''nZ'' is given by &lt;math&gt;\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{n}{\gcd(n,k!)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Bhargava posed to himself the following problem and obtained an affirmative answer: In the above theorems, can one replace the set of integers by some other set ''S'' (a subset of ''Z'', or a subset of some [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]]) and define a function depending on ''S'' which assigns a value to each non-negative integer ''k'', denoted by ''k''!&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt;, such that the statements obtained from the theorems given earlier by replacing ''k''! by ''k''!&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; remain true?

==The generalisation==

* Let ''S'' be an arbitrary infinite subset of the set ''Z'' of integers.
* Choose a prime number ''p''.
* Construct an ordered sequence {''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, . . . } of numbers chosen from ''S'' as follows (such a sequence is called a ''p''-ordering of ''S''):
:# ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is any arbitrary element of ''S''.
:# ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is any arbitrary element of ''S'' such that the highest power of ''p'' that divides ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is minimum.
:# ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is any arbitrary element of ''S'' such that the highest power of ''p'' that divides (''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)(''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is minimum.
:# ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is any arbitrary element of ''S'' such that the highest power of ''p'' that divides (''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)(''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is minimum.
:# . . . and so on.
* Construct a ''p''-ordering of ''S'' for each prime number ''p''. (For a given prime number ''p'', the ''p''-ordering of ''S'' is not unique.)
* For each non-negative integer ''k'', let ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'', ''p'') be the highest power of ''p'' that divides (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) . . . (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;). The sequence {''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'', ''p''), ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'', ''p''), ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'', ''p''), ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'', ''p''), . . . } is called the associated ''p''-sequence of ''S''. This is independent of any particular choice of ''p''-ordering of ''S''. (We assume that ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'', ''p'') = 1 always.)
* The factorial of the integer ''k'', associated with the infinite set ''S'', is defined as &lt;math&gt;k!_{S}=\prod_p v_k(S,p)&lt;/math&gt;, where the product is taken over all prime numbers ''p''.

==Example: Factorials using set of prime numbers==

Let ''S'' be the set of all prime numbers ''P'' = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, . . . }.
:* Choose ''p'' = 2 and form a ''p''-ordering of ''P''.
::* Choose ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 19 arbitrarily from ''P''.
::* To choose ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:
:::* The highest power of ''p'' that divides 2&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = −17 is 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1. Also, for any ''a'' ≠ 2 in P, ''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is divisible by 2. Hence, the highest power of ''p'' that divides (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) is minimum when ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 and the minimum power is 1. Thus ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is chosen as 2 and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'', 2) = 1.
::* To choose ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:
:::* It can be seen that for each element ''a'' in ''P'', the product ''x'' = (''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;19)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2) is divisible by 2. Also, when ''a'' = 5, ''x'' is divisible 2  and it is not divisible by any higher power of 2. So, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may be chosen as 5. We have ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'', 2) = 2.
::* To choose ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:
:::* It can be seen that for each element ''a'' in ''P'', the product ''x'' = (''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;19)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;5) is divisible by 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8. Also, when ''a'' = 17, ''x'' is divisible 8  and it is not divisible by any higher power of 2. Choose ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 17. Also we have ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'',2) = 8.
::* To choose ''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:
:::* It can be seen that for each element ''a'' in ''P'', the product ''x'' = (''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;19)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;5)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;17) is divisible by 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 16. Also, when ''a'' = 23, ''x'' is divisible 16  and it is not divisible by any higher power of 2. Choose ''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 23. Also we have ''v''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'',2) = 16.
::* To choose ''a''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;:
:::* It can be seen that for each element ''a'' in ''P'', the product ''x'' = (''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;19)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;5)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;17)(''a''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;23) is divisible by 2&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = 128. Also, when ''a'' = 31, ''x'' is divisible 128  and it is not divisible by any higher power of 2. Choose ''a''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 31. Also we have ''v''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'',2) = 128.
::* The process is continued. Thus a 2-ordering of P is {19, 2, 5, 17, 23, 31, . . . } and the associated 2-sequence is {1, 1, 2, 8, 16, 128, . . . }, assuming that ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''P'', 2) = 1.

:* For ''p'' = 3, one possible ''p''-ordering of ''P'' is the sequence {2, 3, 7, 5, 13, 17, 19, . . . } and the associated ''p''-sequence of ''P'' is {1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 9, . . . }.

:* For ''p'' = 5, one possible ''p''-ordering of ''P'' is the sequence {2, 3, 5, 19, 11, 7, 13, . . . } and the associated ''p''-sequence is  {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, . . .}.

:* It can be shown that for ''p'' ≥ 7, the first few elements of the associated ''p''-sequences are {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,  . . . }.


The first few factorials associated with the set of prime numbers are obtained as follows {{OEIS|id=A053657}}.

==Example: Factorials using the set of natural numbers==

Let ''S'' be the set of natural numbers ''Z''.

:* For ''p'' = 2, the associated ''p''-sequence is {1, 1, 2, 2, 8, 8, 16, 16, 128, 128, 256, 256, . . . }.
:* For ''p'' = 3, the associated ''p''-sequence is {1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 9, 9, 9, 27, 27, 27, 81, 81, 81, . . .}.
:* For ''p'' = 5, the associated ''p''-sequence is {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 25, 25, 25, 25, 25, . . . }.
:* For ''p'' = 7, the associated ''p''-sequence is {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, . . .}.
:* . . . and so on.

Thus the first few factorials using the natural numbers are

:* 0!&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1×1×1×1×1×. . . = 1.
:* 1!&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1×1×1×1×1×. . . = 1.
:* 2!&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2×1×1×1×1×. . . = 2.
:* 3!&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2×3×1×1×1×. . . = 6.
:* 4!&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt; = 8×3×1×1×1×. . . = 24.
:* 5!&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt; = 8×3×5×1×1×. . . = 120.
:* 6!&lt;sub&gt;''Z''&lt;/sub&gt; = 16×9×5×1×1×. . . = 720.

In [[set theory]] and its applications throughout [[mathematics]], a '''class''' is a collection of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] (or sometimes other mathematical objects) that can be unambiguously defined by a property that all its members share. The precise definition of "class" depends on foundational context. In work on [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], the notion of class is informal, whereas other set theories, such as [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], axiomatize the notion of "proper class", e.g., as entities that are not members of another entity.

A class that is not a set (informally in Zermelo–Fraenkel) is called a '''proper class''', and a class that is a set is sometimes called a '''small class'''. For instance, the class of all [[ordinal number]]s, and the class of all sets, are proper classes in many formal systems.

Outside set theory, the word "class" is sometimes used synonymously with "set". This usage dates from a historical period where classes and sets were not distinguished as they are in modern set-theoretic terminology. Many discussions of "classes" in the 19th century and earlier are really referring to sets, or perhaps to a more ambiguous concept.

==Examples==
The collection of all algebraic objects of a given type will usually be a proper class. Examples include the class of all [[group (mathematics)|group]]s, the class of all [[vector space]]s, and many others. In [[category theory]], a category whose collection of objects forms a proper class (or whose collection of [[morphism]]s forms a proper class) is called a [[large category]].

The [[surreal number]]s are a proper class of objects that have the properties of a [[field (mathematics)|field]].

Within set theory, many collections of sets turn out to be proper classes. Examples include the class of all sets, the class of all ordinal numbers, and the class of all cardinal numbers.

One way to prove that a class is proper is to place it in [[bijection]] with the class of all ordinal numbers. This method is used, for example, in the proof that there is no [[free lattice#The complete free lattice|free]] [[complete lattice#Free complete lattices|complete lattice]] on three or more [[Generator (mathematics)|generators]].

== Paradoxes ==
The [[naive set theory#Paradoxes|paradoxes of naive set theory]] can be explained in terms of the inconsistent assumption that "all classes are sets". With a rigorous foundation, these paradoxes instead suggest [[proof (mathematics)|proof]]s that certain classes are proper (i.e., that they are not sets). For example, [[Russell's paradox]] suggests a proof that the class of all sets which do not contain themselves is proper, and the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] suggests that the class of all [[ordinal numbers]] is proper. The paradoxes do not arise with classes because there is no notion of classes containing classes. Otherwise, one could, for example, define a class of all classes that do not contain themselves, which would lead to a Russell paradox for classes.  A [[conglomerate (set theory)|conglomerate]], on the other hand, can have proper classes as members.

== Classes in formal set theories ==

[[ZF set theory]] does not formalize the notion of classes, so each formula with classes must be reduced syntactically to a formula without classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/abeq2.html |title=abeq2 - Metamath Proof Explorer |publisher=us.metamath.org |date=1993-08-05 |accessdate=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, one can reduce the formula &lt;math&gt;A = \{x\mid x=x \}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\forall x(x\in A\leftrightarrow x=x)&lt;/math&gt;. Semantically, in a [[metalanguage]], the classes can be described as equivalence classes of logical formulas: If &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] interpreting ZF, then the object language class builder expression &lt;math&gt;\{x\mid \phi \}&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; by the collection of all the elements from the domain of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; on which &lt;math&gt;\lambda x\phi&lt;/math&gt; holds; thus, the class can be described as the set of all predicates equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (including &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; itself). In particular, one can identify the "class of all sets" with the set of all predicates equivalent to &lt;math&gt;x=x&lt;/math&gt;.

Because classes do not have any formal status in the theory of ZF, the axioms of ZF do not immediately apply to classes. However, if an [[inaccessible cardinal]] &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is assumed, then the sets of smaller rank form a model of ZF (a [[Grothendieck universe]]), and its subsets can be thought of as "classes".

In ZF, the concept of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] can also be generalised to classes. A class function is not a function in the usual sense, since it is not a set; it is rather a formula &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; with the property that for any set &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; there is no more than one set &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; such that the pair &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. For example, the class function mapping each set to its successor may be expressed as the formula &lt;math&gt;y = x \cup \{x\}&lt;/math&gt;. The fact that the ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; may be expressed with the shorthand notation &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = y&lt;/math&gt;.

Another approach is taken by the [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel axioms]] (NBG); classes are the basic objects in this theory, and a set is then defined to be a class that is an element of some other class. However, the class existence axioms of NBG are restricted so that they only quantify over sets, rather than over all classes. This causes NBG to be a [[conservative extension]] of ZF.

[[Morse–Kelley set theory]] admits proper classes as basic objects, like NBG, but also allows quantification over all proper classes in its class existence axioms. This causes MK to be strictly stronger than both NBG and ZF.

In other set theories, such as [[New Foundations]] or the theory of [[semiset]]s, the concept of "proper class" still makes sense (not all classes are sets) but the criterion of sethood is not closed under subsets. For example, any set theory with a universal set has proper classes which are subclasses of sets.

Every element of a class is a set. A [[conglomerate (set theory)|conglomerate]], on the other hand, can have proper classes as members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5131">In algebraic geometry, given a morphism ''f'': ''X'' → ''S'' of schemes, the '''cotangent sheaf''' on ''X'' is the [[sheaf of modules|sheaf of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt;-modules]] that [[representable functor|represents]] (or classifies) ''S''-[[derivation (differential algebra)|derivations]] &lt;ref&gt;http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/08RL&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense: for any &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}_X&lt;/math&gt;-modules ''F'', there is an isomorphism
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\Omega_{X/S}, F) = \operatorname{Der}_S(\mathcal{O}_X, F)&lt;/math&gt;
that depends naturally on ''F''. In other words, the cotangent sheaf is characterized by the universal property: there is the differential &lt;math&gt;d: \mathcal{O}_X \to \Omega_{X/S}&lt;/math&gt; such that any ''S''-derivation &lt;math&gt;D: \mathcal{O}_X \to F&lt;/math&gt; factors as &lt;math&gt;D = \alpha \circ d&lt;/math&gt; with some &lt;math&gt;\alpha: \Omega_{X/S} \to F&lt;/math&gt;.

In the case ''X'' and ''S'' are affine schemes, the above definition means that &lt;math&gt;\Omega_{X/S}&lt;/math&gt; is the module of [[Kähler differential]]s. The standard way to construct a cotangent sheaf (e.g., Hartshorne, Ch II. § 8) is through a diagonal morphism (which amounts to gluing modules of Kähler differentials on affine charts to get the globally-defined cotangent sheaf.) The [[dual module]] of the cotangent sheaf on a scheme ''X'' is called the '''tangent sheaf''' on ''X'' and is sometimes denoted by &lt;math&gt;\Theta_X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;In concise terms, this means:
:&lt;math&gt;\Theta_X \overset{\mathrm{def}} = \mathcal{H}om_{\mathcal{O}_X}(\Omega_X, \mathcal{O}_X) = \mathcal{D}er(\mathcal{O}_X).&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two important exact sequences:
#If ''S'' →''T'' is a morphism of schemes, then
#:&lt;math&gt;f^* \Omega_{S/T} \to \Omega_{X/T} \to \Omega_{X/S} \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;
#If ''Z'' is a closed subscheme of ''X'' with ideal sheaf ''I'', then
#:&lt;math&gt;I/I^2 \to \Omega_{X/S} \otimes \mathcal{O}_Z \to \Omega_{Z/S} \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hartshorne|loc=Ch. II, Proposition 8.12.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/79956/jacobian-criterion-for-smoothness-of-schemes as well as {{harv|Hartshorne|loc=Ch. II, Theorem 8.17.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cotangent sheaf is closely related to [[smooth variety|smoothness]] of a variety or scheme. For example, an algebraic variety is [[smooth variety|smooth]] of dimension ''n'' if and only if Ω&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[locally free sheaf]] of rank ''n''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hartshorne|loc=Ch. II, Theorem 8.15.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction through a diagonal morphism ==
{{See also|cotangent bundle#The cotangent sheaf}}
Let &lt;math&gt;f: X \to S&lt;/math&gt; be a morphism of schemes as in the introduction and Δ: ''X'' → ''X'' ×&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; ''X'' the diagonal morphism. Then the image of Δ is [[locally closed]]; i.e., closed in some open subset ''W'' of ''X'' ×&lt;sub&gt;''S''&lt;/sub&gt; ''X'' (the image is closed if and only if ''f'' is [[separated morphism|separated]]). Let ''I'' be the ideal sheaf of Δ(''X'') in ''W''. One then puts:
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_{X/S} = \Delta^* (I/I^2)&lt;/math&gt;
and checks this sheaf of modules satisfies the required universal property of a cotangent sheaf (Hartshorne, Ch II. Remark 8.9.2). The construction shows in particular that the cotangent sheaf is [[quasi-coherent sheaf|quasi-coherent]]. It is coherent if ''S'' is [[Noetherian scheme|Noetherian]] and ''f'' is of finite type.

The above definition means that the cotangent sheaf on ''X'' is the restriction to ''X'' of the [[conormal sheaf]] to the diagonal embedding of ''X'' over ''S''.

== Relation to a tautological line bundle ==
{{main|Euler sequence}}

The cotangent sheaf on a projective space is related to the [[tautological line bundle]] ''O''(-1) by the following exact sequence: writing &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}^n_R&lt;/math&gt; for the projective space over a ring ''R'',
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to \Omega_{\mathbf{P}^n_R/R} \to \mathcal{O}_{\mathbf{P}^n_R}(-1)^{\oplus(n+1)} \to \mathcal{O}_{\mathbf{P}^n_R} \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;

(See also [[Chern class#Complex projective space]].)

== Cotangent stack ==
For this notion, see § 1 of
:A. Beilinson and V. Drinfeld, Quantization of Hitchin’s integrable system and Hecke eigensheaves [http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~mitya/langlands/hitchin/BD-hitchin.pdf]&lt;ref&gt;see also: § 3 of http://www.math.harvard.edu/~gaitsgde/grad_2009/SeminarNotes/Sept22(Dmodstack1).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
There, the cotangent stack on an algebraic stack ''X'' is defined as the [[relative Spec]] of the symmetric algebra of the tangent sheaf on ''X''. (Note: in general, if ''E'' is a [[locally free sheaf]] of finite rank, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Spec}(\operatorname{Sym}(\check{E}))&lt;/math&gt; is the [[algebraic vector bundle]] corresponding to ''E''.)

See also: [[Hitchin fibration]] (the cotangent stack of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Bun}_G(X)&lt;/math&gt; is the total space of the Hitchin fibration.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2095">In [[probability theory]], for a [[probability measure]] '''P''' on a [[Hilbert space]] ''H'' with [[inner product]] &lt;math&gt;\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle &lt;/math&gt;, the '''covariance''' of '''P''' is the [[bilinear form]] Cov:&amp;nbsp;''H''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''H''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cov}(x, y) = \int_{H} \langle x, z \rangle \langle y, z \rangle \, \mathrm{d} \mathbf{P} (z)&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''H''. The '''covariance operator''' ''C'' is then defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cov}(x, y) = \langle Cx, y \rangle&lt;/math&gt;

(from the [[Riesz representation theorem]], such operator exists if Cov is [[Bilinear form#On normed vector spaces|bounded]]). Since Cov is symmetric in its arguments, the covariance operator is
[[self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]] (the infinite-dimensional analogy of the transposition symmetry in the finite-dimensional case). When '''P''' is a centred [[Gaussian measure]], ''C'' is also a [[nuclear operator]]. In particular, it is a [[compact operator]] of [[trace class]], that is, it has finite [[trace (mathematics)|trace]].

Even more generally, for a [[probability measure]] '''P''' on a [[Banach space]] ''B'', the covariance of '''P''' is the [[bilinear form]] on the [[algebraic dual]] ''B''&lt;sup&gt;#&lt;/sup&gt;, defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cov}(x, y) = \int_{B} \langle x, z \rangle \langle y, z \rangle \, \mathrm{d} \mathbf{P} (z)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \langle x, z \rangle &lt;/math&gt; is now the value of the linear functional ''x'' on the element ''z''.

Quite similarly, the [[covariance function]] of a function-valued [[random element]] (in special cases called [[random process]] or [[random field]]) ''z'' is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Cov}(x, y) = \int z(x) z(y) \, \mathrm{d} \mathbf{P} (z) = E(z(x) z(y))&lt;/math&gt;

where ''z''(''x'') is now the value of the function ''z'' at the point ''x'', i.e., the value of the [[linear functional]] &lt;math&gt; u \mapsto u(x) &lt;/math&gt; evaluated at ''z''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9325">In [[geometry]], the problem of '''dividing a circle into areas''' by means of an inscribed [[polygon]] with ''n'' sides, in such a way as to ''maximise'' the number of areas created by the edges and [[diagonal]]s, has a solution by an inductive method.

== Lemma ==

[[Image:DividingACircleIntoAreas-Box.png|right|150px|Lemma]]
If we already have ''n'' points on the circle and add one more point, we draw ''n'' lines from the new point to previously existing points. Two cases are possible. In the first case ('''a'''), the new line passes through a point where two or more old lines (between previously existing points) cross. In the second case ('''b'''), the new line crosses each of the old lines in a different point. It will be useful to know the following fact.

'''Lemma'''. We can choose the new point ''A'' so that case ''b'' occurs for each of the new lines.

'''Proof'''. Notice that, for the case ''a'', three points must be on one line: the new point ''A'', the old point ''O'' to which we draw the line, and the point ''I'' where two of the old lines intersect. Notice that there are ''n'' old points ''O'', and hence finitely many points ''I'' where two of the old lines intersect. For each ''O'' and ''I'', the line ''OI'' crosses the circle in one point other than ''O''.  Since the circle has infinitely many points, it has a point ''A'' which will be on none of the lines ''OI''. Then, for this point ''A'' and all of the old points ''O'', case ''b'' will be true.

This lemma means that, if there are ''k'' lines crossing ''AO'', then each of them crosses ''AO'' at a different point and ''k+1'' new areas are created by the line ''AO''.

== Solution ==

=== Inductive method ===

The lemma establishes an important property for solving the problem. By employing an [[mathematical induction|inductive proof]], one can arrive at a formula for ''f''(''n'') in terms of ''f''(''n'' − 1).

[[Image:DividingACircleIntoAreas.svg|right|180px|Proof]]

In the figure you can see the dark lines connecting
points 1 through 4 dividing the circle into 8 total
regions (i.e., ''f''(4) = 8).  This figure illustrates the inductive
step from ''n'' = 4 to ''n'' = 5 with the dashed lines.  When the fifth point is added (i.e., when
computing ''f''(5) using ''f''(4)), this results
in four new lines (the dashed lines in the diagram) being added, numbered 1 through 4, one for each point that they connect
to. The number of new regions introduced by the fifth point can
therefore be determined by considering the number of regions added by
each of the 4 lines.  Set ''i'' to count the lines we are adding.
Each new line can cross a number of existing lines, depending on which
point it is to (the value of ''i'').  The new lines will never cross
each other, except at the new point.

The number of lines that each new line intersects can be determined by
considering the number of points on the "left" of the line and the
number of points on the "right" of the line.  Since all existing
points already have lines between them, the number of points on the
left multiplied by the number of points on the right is the number of
lines that will be crossing the new line.  For the line to point ''i'',
there are

:''n'' − ''i''  − 1

points on the left and

:''i'' − 1 points

on the right, so
a total of

: (''n''  − ''i''  − 1) (''i''  − 1)

lines must be crossed.

In this example, the lines to ''i'' = 1 and ''i'' = 4 each cross zero lines,
while the lines to ''i'' = 2  and ''i'' = 3 each cross two lines (there are two
points on one side and one on the other).

So the recurrence can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)=f(n-1)+\sum^{n-1}_{i=1}\left(1+\left(n-i-1\right)\left(i-1\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

which can be easily reduced to

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)=f(n-1)+\sum^{n-1}_{i=1}\left(2-n+ni-i^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

using the sums of the first &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt; natural numbers and the first &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt; squares, this combines to

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)=f(n-1)+\frac{1}{6}n^3-n^2+\frac{17}{6}n-2&lt;/math&gt;

Finally

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)=\sum^{n}_{k=1}\left(\frac{1}{6}k^3-k^2+\frac{17}{6}k-2\right)+1&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;f(0)=1&lt;/math&gt;

which yields

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)=\frac{n}{24}(n^3-6n^2+23n-18)+1&lt;/math&gt;

=== Combinatorics and topology method ===

The lemma asserts that the number of regions is maximal if all "inner" intersections of chords are simple (exactly two chords pass through each point of intersection in the interior). This will be the case if the points on the circle are chosen "[[in general position]]". Under this assumption of "generic intersection", the number of regions can also be determined in a non-inductive way, using the formula for the [[Euler characteristic]] of a [[Connectivity (graph theory)#Definitions of components.2C cuts and connectivity|connected]] [[planar graph]] (viewed here as a graph embedded in the 2-[[sphere]] S&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;).

A planar graph determines a [[cell decomposition]] of the plane with ''F'' faces (2-dimensional cells), ''E'' edges (1-dimensional cells) and ''V'' vertices (0-dimensional cells). As the graph is connected, the Euler relation for the 2-dimensional sphere S&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\, V-E+F=2 &lt;/math&gt;
holds. View the diagram (the circle together with all the chords) above as a planar graph. If the general formulas for ''V'' and ''E'' can both be found, the formula for ''F'' can also be derived, which will solve the problem.

Its vertices include the ''n'' points on the circle, referred to as the exterior vertices, as well as the interior vertices, the intersections of distinct chords in the interior of the circle. The "generic intersection" assumption made above guarantees that each interior vertex is the intersection of no more than two chords.

Thus the main task in determining ''V'' is finding the number of interior vertices. As a consequence of the lemma, any two intersecting chords will uniquely determine an interior vertex. These chords are in turn uniquely determined by the four corresponding endpoints of the chords, which are all exterior vertices. Any four exterior vertices determine a [[cyclic quadrilateral]], and all cyclic quadrilaterals are convex [[quadrilateral]]s, so each set of four exterior vertices have exactly one point of intersection formed by their diagonals(chords). Further, by definition ''all'' interior vertices are formed by intersecting chords.

Therefore each interior vertex is uniquely determined by a combination of four exterior vertices, where the number of interior vertices is given by
:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{interior}} = { n \choose 4 },&lt;/math&gt;
and so
:&lt;math&gt;V = V_{\text{exterior}} + V_{\text{interior}} = n + { n \choose 4 }.&lt;/math&gt;

The edges include the ''n'' [[circular arc]]s connecting pairs of adjacent exterior vertices, as well as the chordal line segments (described below) created inside the circle by the collection of chords. Since there are two groups of vertices: exterior and interior, the chordal line segments can be further categorized into three groups:
# Edges directly (not cut by other chords) connecting two exterior vertices. These are chords between adjacent exterior vertices, and form the perimeter of the polygon. There are ''n'' such edges.
# Edges connecting two interior vertices.
# Edges connecting an interior and exterior vertex.

To find the number of edges in groups 2 and 3, consider each interior vertex, which is connected to exactly four edges. This yields
:&lt;math&gt;4{ n \choose 4 }&lt;/math&gt;
edges. Since each edge is defined by two endpoint vertices, and we only enumerated the interior vertices, group 2 edges are counted twice while group 3 edges are counted once only.

Notice that every chord that is cut by another (i.e., chords not in group 1) must contain two group 3 edges, its beginning and ending chordal segments. As chords are uniquely determined by two exterior vertices, there are altogether
:&lt;math&gt;2\left( { n \choose 2 } - n \right)&lt;/math&gt;
group 3 edges. This is twice the total number of chords that are not themselves members of group 1.

The sum of these results divided by two gives the combined number of edges in groups 2 and 3. Adding the ''n'' edges from group 1, and the ''n'' circular arc edges brings the total to
:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{4{ n \choose 4 } + 2\left( { n \choose 2 } - n \right)}{2} + n + n = 2{ n \choose 4 } + { n \choose 2 } + n.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting ''V'' and ''E'' into the Euler relation solved for ''F'', &lt;math&gt;\, F = E - V + 2, &lt;/math&gt; one then obtains
:&lt;math&gt; F = { n \choose 4 } + { n \choose 2 } + 2.&lt;/math&gt;

Since one of these faces is the exterior of the circle, the number of regions ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt; inside the circle is ''F'' − 1, or

:&lt;math&gt; r_G={n \choose 4}+{n \choose 2}+1,&lt;/math&gt;

which resolves to

:&lt;math&gt;r_G=\frac{n!}{(n-4)! 4!}+\frac{n!}{(n-2)! 2!}+1&lt;/math&gt;

which yields the same quartic polynomial obtained by using the inductive method

:&lt;math&gt;r_G=\frac{1}{24}n(n^3-6n^2+23n-18)+1&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5285">In [[graph theory]], an '''edge-graceful''' graph labeling is a type of [[graph labeling]]. This is a labeling for [[simple graph]]s in which no two distinct [[edge (graph theory)|edge]]s connect the same two distinct [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]], no edge connects a vertex to itself, and the graph is [[Connected graph|connected]]. Edge-graceful labelings were first introduced by S. Lo in his seminal paper.&lt;ref&gt;Lo (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

Given a graph ''G'', we denote the set of edges by ''E''(''G'') and the vertices by ''V''(''G''). Let q be the [[cardinality]] of ''E''(''G'') and ''p'' be that of ''V''(''G''). Once a labeling of the edges is given, a vertex ''u'' of the graph is labeled by the sum of the labels of the edges incident to it, modulo ''p''. Or, in symbols, the induced labeling on the vertex ''u'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;V(u)=\Sigma E(e) \mod |V(G)|&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V''(''u'') is the label for the vertex and ''E''(''e'') is the assigned value of an edge incident to ''u''.

The problem is to find a labeling for the edges such that all the labels from 1 to ''q'' are used once and the induced labels on the vertices run from 0 to ''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. In other words, the resulting set for labels of the edges should be &lt;math&gt;\{1,2 \dots q\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{0,1 \dots p-1\}&lt;/math&gt; for the vertices.

A graph ''G'' is said to be edge-graceful if it admits an edge-graceful labeling.

== Examples ==

=== Paths ===

Consider a [[path (graph theory)|path]] with two vertices, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Here the only possibility is to label the only edge in the graph 1. The induced labeling on the two vertices are both 1. So ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is not edge-graceful.

Appending an edge and a vertex to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the path with three vertices. Denote the vertices by ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Label the two edges in the following way: the edge (''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is labeled 1 and (''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) labeled 2. The induced labelings on ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are then 1, 0, and 2 respectively. This is an edge-graceful labeling and so ''P''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is edge-graceful.

Similarly, one can check that ''P''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is not edge-graceful.

In general, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is edge-graceful when ''m'' is odd and not edge-graceful when it is even. This follows from a necessary condition for edge-gracefulness (see below).

=== Cycles ===

Consider the [[cycle graph|cycle]] with three vertices, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This is simply a triangle. One can label the edges 1, 2, and 3, and check directly that, along with the induced labeling on the vertices, this gives an edge-graceful labeling.

Similar to paths, &lt;math&gt;C_m&lt;/math&gt; is edge-graceful when ''m'' is odd and not when ''m'' is even.

An edge-graceful labeling of &lt;math&gt;C_5&lt;/math&gt; is shown in the following figure:

[[Image:Edge graceful c5.svg]]

== A necessary condition ==

Lo gave a necessary condition for a graph to be edge-graceful. It is that a graph with ''q'' edges and ''p'' vertices is edge graceful only if

:&lt;math&gt;\; q(q+1)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Congruence relation#modular arithmetic|congruent]] to &lt;math&gt;\frac{p(p-1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt; modulo ''p''.

or, in symbols,

:&lt;math&gt;q(q+1) \equiv \frac{p(p-1)}{2} \mod p.&lt;/math&gt;

This is referred to as '''Lo's condition''' in the literature. This follows from the fact that the sum of the labels of the vertices is twice the sum of the edges, modulo ''p''. This is useful for disproving a graph is edge-graceful. For instance, one can apply this directly to the path and cycle examples given above.

== Further selected results ==

*The [[Petersen graph]] is not edge-graceful.
*The [[star graph]] &lt;math&gt;S_m&lt;/math&gt; (a central node and ''m'' legs of length 1) is edge-graceful when ''m'' is [[even number|even]] and not when ''m'' is [[odd number|odd]].
*The [[friendship graph]] &lt;math&gt;F_m&lt;/math&gt; is edge-graceful when ''m'' is odd and not when it is even.
*[[Regular tree]]s, &lt;math&gt;T_{m,n}&lt;/math&gt; (depth ''n'' with each non-leaf node emitting ''m'' new vertices) are edge-graceful when ''m'' is even for any value ''n'' but not edge-graceful whenever ''m'' is odd.
*The [[complete graph]] on ''n'' vertices, &lt;math&gt;K_n&lt;/math&gt;, is edge-graceful unless ''n'' is [[singly even]], &lt;math&gt;n=2\mod 4&lt;/math&gt;.
*The [[ladder graph]] is never edge-graceful.

An effective method is sometimes also called '''mechanical''' method or procedure.&lt;ref name=alanturingnet&gt;{{cite web|last=Copeland|first=B.J.|title=The Turing-Church Thesis|url=http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/reference%20articles/The%20Turing-Church%20Thesis.html|work=AlanTuring.net|publisher=Turing Archive for the History of Computing|date=June 2000|accessdate=23 March 2013|authorlink=Jack Copeland |author2=Copeland, Jack |author3=Proudfoot, Diane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The definition of an effective method involves more than the method itself. In order for a method to be called effective, it must be considered with respect to a class of problems. Because of this, one method may be effective with respect to one class of problems and ''not'' be effective with respect to a different class.

A method is formally called effective for a class of problems when it satisfies these criteria:
* It consists of a finite number of exact, finite instructions.
* When it is applied to a problem from its class:
** It always finishes (''terminates'') after a finite number of steps.
** It always produces a correct answer.
* In principle, it can be done by a human without any aids except writing materials.
* Its instructions need only to be followed [[Rigour|rigorously]] to succeed. In other words, it requires no [[ingenuity]] to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, ''effective procedure''&lt;/ref&gt;

Optionally, it may also be required that the method never returns a result as if it were an answer when the method is applied to a problem from ''outside'' its class. Adding this requirement reduces the set of classes for which there is an effective method.

==Algorithms==
An effective method for calculating the values of a function is an [[algorithm]]. Functions for which an effective method exists are sometimes called '''effectively calculable'''.

==Computable functions==
Several independent efforts to give a formal characterization of effective calculability led to a variety of proposed definitions ([[Recursion|general recursion]], [[Turing machine]]s, [[λ-calculus]]) that later were shown to be equivalent. The notion captured by these definitions is known as [[Computable function|recursive or effective computability]].

The [[Church-Turing thesis]] states that the two notions coincide: any [[number-theoretic function]] that is effectively calculable is [[computable function|recursively computable]]. As this is not a mathematical statement, it cannot be proven by a [[mathematical proof]].

[[Image:Ptolemaic elements.svg|250px|right|thumb|The basic elements of [[Ptolemaic astronomy]], showing a planet on an [[epicycle]] with a [[deferent]] and an equant point.]]

'''Equant''' (or '''punctum aequans''') is a [[mathematical]] concept developed by [[Claudius Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century AD to account for the observed motion of the planets. The equant is used to explain the observed speed change in planetary orbit during different stages of the orbit. This planetary concept allowed Ptolemy to keep the theory of uniform circular motion alive by stating that the path of heavenly bodies was uniform around one point and circular around another point.

== Placement ==
The '''equant point''' (shown in the diagram by the large&amp;nbsp;•&amp;nbsp;), is placed so that it is directly opposite to Earth from the [[deferent and epicycle|deferent]]'s center, known as the ''eccentric'' (represented by the&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;). A [[planet]] or the center of an [[epicycle]] (a smaller circle carrying the planet) was conceived to move at a constant [[angular speed]] with respect to the equant. In other words, to a hypothetical observer placed at the equant point, the epicycle's center (indicated by the small&amp;nbsp;·&amp;nbsp;) would appear to move at a steady angular speed. However, the epicycle's center will not move at a constant speed along its deferent.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite journal| first=James| last=Evans| title=On the function and probable origin of Ptolemy's equant| date=April 18, 1984| url=http://www2.ups.edu/faculty/jcevans/Equant.pdf| accessdate=August 29, 2014| journal=[[American Journal of Physics]]| volume=52| number=12| pages=1080–89| doi=10.1119/1.13764| bibcode=1984AmJPh..52.1080E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the implementation of the equant was to maintain a semblance of constant [[diurnal motion|circular motion]] of [[astronomical object|celestial bodies]], a long-standing article of faith originated by [[Aristotle]] for philosophical reasons, while also allowing for the best match of the computations of the observed movements of the bodies, particularly in the size of the [[apparent retrograde motion]] of all [[Solar System]] bodies except the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]].

== Equation ==
The angle α whose vertex is at the center of the deferent and whose sides intersect the planet and the equant respectively is a function of time&amp;nbsp;''t'':

: &lt;math&gt; \alpha(t) = \Omega t - \arcsin\left(\frac{E}{R} \sin(\Omega t) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where Ω is the constant angular speed seen from the equant which is situated at a distance ''E'' when the radius of the deferent is&amp;nbsp;''R''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath639/kmath639.htm  Eccentrics, deferents, epicycles and equants (Mathpages)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The equant model has a body in motion on a circular path that does not share a center with Earth. The moving object's speed will actually vary during its orbit around the outer circle (dashed line), faster in the bottom half and slower in the top half. The motion is considered uniform only because the planet sweeps around equal angles in equal times from the equant point. The speed of the object is non-uniform when viewed from any other point within the orbit.

==Discovery and use==
Ptolemy introduced the equant in "[[Almagest]]". The evidence that the equant was a required adjustment to [[Aristotelian physics]] relied on observations made by himself and a certain "Theon" (perhaps, [[Theon of Smyrna]]).&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;

In models of the universe that precede Ptolemy, generally attributed to [[Hipparchus]], the eccentric and epicycles were already a feature. The Roman Pliny in the 1st century CE, who apparently had access to writings of late Greek astronomers, and not being an astronomer himself, still correctly identified the lines of apsides for the five known planets and where they pointed in the zodiac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D2&amp;force=y| accessdate=August 7, 2014| last=Pliny the Elder| title=The Natural History, Book 2: An account of the world and the elements, Chapter 13: Why the same stars appear at some times more lofty and some times more near}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such data requires the concept of eccentric centers of motion.  Most of what we know about Hipparchus comes to us through mentions of his works by Ptolemy in the ''Almagest''. Hipparchus' models' features explained differences in the length of the seasons on Earth (known as the "first anomaly"), and the appearance of retrograde motion in the planets (known as the "second anomaly"). But Hipparchus was unable to make the predictions about the location and duration of retrograde motions of the planets match observations; he could match location, or he could match duration, but not both simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://science.larouchepac.com/kepler/astronomianova/part1/5| title=The New Astronomy - Equants, from Part 1 of Kepler's Astronomia Nova| publisher=science.larouchepac.com| accessdate=August 1, 2014}} An excellent video on the effects of the equant&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy's introduction of the equant resolved that contradiction: the location was determined by the deferent and epicycle, while the duration was determined by uniform motion around the equant.

Ptolemy's model of astronomy was used as a technical method that could answer questions regarding astrology and predicting planets positions for almost 1500 years, even though the equant and eccentric were violations of pure [[Aristotelian physics]] which required all motion to be centered on the Earth.  For many centuries rectifying these violations was a preoccupation among scholars, culminating in the solutions of [[Ibn al-Shatir]] and [[Copernicus]]. Ptolemy's predictions, which required constant oversight and corrections by concerned scholars over those centuries, culminated in the observations of [[Tycho Brahe]] at [[Uraniborg]].

It wasn't until [[Johannes Kepler]] published his ''[[Astronomia Nova]]'', based on the data he and Tycho collected at Uraniborg, that Ptolemy's model of the heavens was entirely supplanted by a new geometrical model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Michael| last=Perryman| title=History of Astrometry| date=2012-09-17| arxiv=1209.3563|bibcode = 2012EPJH...37..745P |doi = 10.1140/epjh/e2012-30039-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal|arxiv=0906.0484|last=Bracco|author2=Provost|title=Had the planet Mars not existed: Kepler's equant model and its physical consequences|journal=European Journal of Physics|date=2009|volume=30|pages=1085–92|doi=10.1088/0143-0807/30/5/015|bibcode = 2009EJPh...30.1085B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

The equant solved the last major problem of accounting for the anomalistic motion of the planets but was believed by some to compromise the principles of the ancient Greek philosopher/astronomers, namely uniform circular motion about the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Helden|title=Ptolemaic System| url=http://galileo.rice.edu/sci/theories/ptolemaic_system.html| accessdate=20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uniformity was generally assumed to be observed from the center of the deferent, and since that happens at only one point, only non-uniform motion is observed from any other point. Ptolemy moved the observation point explicitly off the center of the deferent to the equant. This can be seen as breaking part of the uniform circular motion rules. Noted critics of the equant include the Persian astronomer [[Nasir al-Din Tusi]] who developed the [[Tusi-couple]] as an alternative explanation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Craig G. Fraser|title=The Cosmos: A Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3tJr_vl6rYsC&amp;pg=PA39|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-33218-0|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], whose alternative was a new pair of epicycles for each deferent. Dislike of the equant was a major motivation for Copernicus to construct his heliocentric system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Kuhn| first = Thomas| authorlink = Thomas Kuhn| title = [[The Copernican Revolution (book)|The Copernican Revolution]]| publisher = [[Harvard University Press]]| year = 1957| isbn = 0-674-17103-9| pages=70–71}} (copyright renewed 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Koestler|Koestler A.]] (1959), ''[[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler book)|The Sleepwalkers]]'', Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, p.&amp;nbsp;322; see also p.&amp;nbsp;206 and refs therein. [https://archive.org/details/ArthurKoestler-TheSleepwalkers-AHistoryOfMansChangingVisionOfThe]&lt;/ref&gt; This violation of perfect circular motion around the center of the deferent bothered many thinkers, especially Copernicus who mentions the equant as a monstrous construction in ''De Revolutionibus''. Copernicus' movement of the Earth away from the center of the universe obviated the primary need for Ptolemy's epicycles by explaining retrograde movement as an optical illusion, but he re-instituted two smaller epicycles into each planet's motion in order to replace the equant.

In [[computing]], a '''fixed-point number''' representation is a [[real data type]] for a number that has a fixed number of digits after (and sometimes also before) the [[radix point]] (after the decimal point '.' in English decimal notation). Fixed-point number representation can be compared to the more complicated (and more computationally demanding) [[floating point|floating-point]] number representation.

Fixed-point numbers are useful for representing [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractional values]], usually in base 2 or base 10, when the executing [[central processing unit|processor]] has no [[floating point unit]] (FPU) or if fixed-point provides improved performance or accuracy for the application at hand. Older or low-cost [[embedded system|embedded]] [[microprocessor]]s and [[microcontroller]]s do not have an FPU.

==Representation==
A value of a fixed-point data type is essentially an [[integer]] that is scaled by an implicit specific factor determined by the type. For example, the value 1.23 can be represented as 1230 in a fixed-point data type with scaling factor of 1/1000, and the value 1,230,000 can be represented as 1230 with a scaling factor of 1000.  Unlike floating-point data types, the scaling factor is the same for all values of the same type, and does not change during the entire computation.

The scaling factor is usually a [[power (mathematics)|power]] of 10 (for human convenience) or a power of 2 (for computational efficiency).  However, other scaling factors may be used occasionally, e.g. a time value in hours may be represented as a fixed-point type with a scale factor of 1/3600 to obtain values with one-second accuracy.

The maximum value of a fixed-point type is simply the largest value that can be represented in the underlying integer type multiplied by the scaling factor; and similarly for the minimum value.

==Operations==
To convert a number from a fixed point type with scaling factor ''R'' to another type with scaling factor ''S'', the underlying integer must be multiplied by ''R'' and divided by ''S''; that is, multiplied by the ratio ''R''/''S''.  Thus, for example, to convert the value 1.23 = 123/100 from a type with scaling factor ''R''=1/100 to one with scaling factor ''S''=1/1000, the underlying integer 123 must be multiplied by (1/100)/(1/1000) = 10, yielding the representation 1230/1000.  If ''S'' does not divide ''R'' (in particular, if the new scaling factor ''S'' is greater than the original ''R''), the new integer will have to be [[rounding|rounded]].  The rounding rules and methods are usually part of the language's specification.

To add or subtract two values of the same fixed-point type, it is sufficient to add or subtract the underlying integers, and keep their common scaling factor.  The result can be exactly represented in the same type, as long as no [[arithmetic overflow|overflow]] occurs (i.e. provided that the sum of the two integers fits in the underlying integer type). If the numbers have different fixed-point types, with different scaling factors, then one of them must be converted to the other before the sum.

To multiply two fixed-point numbers, it suffices to multiply the two underlying integers, and assume that the scaling factor of the result is the product of their scaling factors. This operation involves no rounding. For example, multiplying the numbers 123 scaled by 1/1000 (0.123) and 25 scaled by 1/10 (2.5) yields the integer 123×25 = 3075 scaled by (1/1000)×(1/10) = 1/10000, that is 3075/10000 = 0.3075. If the two operands belong to the same fixed-point type, and the result is also to be represented in that type, then the product of the two integers must be explicitly multiplied by the common scaling factor; in this case the result may have to be rounded, and overflow may occur. For example, if the common scaling factor is 1/100, multiplying 1.23 by 0.25 entails multiplying 123 by 25 to yield 3075 with an intermediate scaling factor of 1/10000.  This then must be multiplied by 1/100 to yield either 31 (0.31) or 30 (0.30), depending on the rounding method used, to result in a final scale factor of 1/100.

To divide two fixed-point numbers, one takes the integer quotient of their underlying integers, and assumes that the scaling factor is the quotient of their scaling factors. The first division involves rounding in general. For example, division of 3456 scaled by 1/100 (34.56) and 1234 scaled by 1/1000 (1.234) yields the integer 3456÷1234 = 3 (rounded) with scale factor (1/100)/(1/1000) = 10, that is, 30.  One can obtain a more accurate result by first converting the [[dividend]] to a more precise type: in the same example, converting 3456 scaled by 1/100 (34.56) to 3,456,000 scaled by 1/100000, before dividing by 1234 scaled by 1/1000 (1.234), would yield 3456000÷1234 = 2801 (rounded) with scaling factor (1/100000)/(1/1000) = 1/100, that is 28.01 (instead of 30).  If both operands and the desired result are represented in the same fixed-point type, then the quotient of the two integers must be explicitly divided by the common scaling factor.

==Binary vs. decimal==
The two most common classes of fixed-point types are decimal and binary. Decimal fixed-point types have a scaling factor that is a power of ten; for binary fixed-point types it is a power of two.

Binary fixed-point types are most commonly used, because the rescaling operations can be implemented as fast [[bit shift]]s. Binary fixed-point numbers can represent fractional powers of two exactly, but, like binary floating-point numbers, cannot exactly represent fractional powers of ten.  If exact fractional powers of ten are desired, then a decimal format should be used.  For example, one-tenth (0.1) and one-hundredth (0.01) can be represented only approximately by binary fixed-point or binary floating-point representations, while they can be represented exactly in decimal fixed-point or decimal floating-point representations.  These representations may be encoded in many ways, including [[binary-coded decimal]] (BCD).

==Notation==
{{main article|Q (number format)}}

There are various notations used to represent word length and radix point in a binary fixed-point number. In the following list, ''f'' represents the number of fractional bits, ''m'' the number of magnitude or integer bits, ''s'' the number of sign bits, and ''b'' the total number of bits.

* '''Q'''''f'': The "Q" prefix. For example, Q15 represents a number with 15 fractional bits. This notation is ambiguous since it does not specify the word length, however it is usually assumed that the word length is either 16 or 32 bits depending on the target processor in use.&lt;ref name="ti"&gt;Texas Instruments, [http://focus.ti.com/lit/ug/spru565b/spru565b.pdf TMS320C64x DSP Library Programmer's Reference], Appendix A.2&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Q'''''m'''''.'''''f'': The unambiguous form of the "Q" notation. Since the entire word is a 2's complement integer, a sign bit is implied.  For example, Q1.30 describes a number with 1 integer bit and 30 fractional bits stored as a 32-bit 2's complement integer.&lt;ref name="ti"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/fixedpoint/ref/bp7g699.html#f6811|title=MathWorks Fixed-Point Toolbox Documentation Glossary|author=|date=|website=mathworks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''fx'''''m'''''.'''''b'': The "fx" prefix is similar to the above, but uses the word length as the second item in the dotted pair. For example, fx1.16 describes a number with 1 magnitude bit and 15 fractional bits in a 16 bit word.&lt;ref name="vsi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vissim.com/products/addons/vissim/fixed-point.html|title=VisSim is now solidThinking Embed|first=solidThinking,|last=Inc.|date=|website=www.vissim.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''s''''':'''''m''''':'''''f'': Yet other notations include a sign bit, such as this one used in the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] GS User's Guide.&lt;ref&gt;PS2 GS User's Guide, Chapter 7.1 "Explanatory Notes"&lt;/ref&gt; It also differs from conventional usage by using a colon instead of a period as the separator. For example, in this notation, 0:8:0 represents an unsigned 8-bit integer.

==Precision loss and overflow==
Because fixed point operations can produce results that have more bits than the [[operand]]s, information loss is possible. For instance, the result of fixed point multiplication could potentially have as many bits as the sum of the number of bits in the two operands. In order to fit the result into the same number of bits as the operands, the answer must be [[Rounding|rounded]] or [[Truncation|truncated]]. If this is the case, the choice of which bits to keep is very important. When multiplying two fixed point numbers with the same format, for instance with &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; integer bits, and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; fractional bits, the answer could have up to &lt;math&gt;2I&lt;/math&gt; integer bits, and &lt;math&gt;2Q&lt;/math&gt; fractional bits.

For simplicity, many fixed-point multiply procedures use the same result format as the operands. This has the effect of keeping the middle bits; the &lt;var&gt;I&lt;/var&gt;-number of least significant integer bits, and the &lt;var&gt;Q&lt;/var&gt;-number of most significant fractional bits. Fractional bits lost below this value represent a precision loss which is common in fractional multiplication. If any integer bits are lost, however, the value will be radically inaccurate. Some model-based fixed-point packages&lt;ref name="vsi-fp"&gt;VisSim Fixed-Point User Guide|http://www.vissim.com/downloads/doc/EmbeddedControlsDeveloper_UGv80.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; allow you to specify a result format different from the input formats. This allows you to maximize precision and avoid overflow.

Some operations, like divide, often have built-in result limiting so that any positive overflow results in the largest possible number that can be represented by the current format. Likewise, negative overflow results in the largest negative number represented by the current format. This built in limiting is often referred to as ''saturation''.

Some processors support a hardware [[overflow flag]] that can generate an [[Exception handling|exception]] on the occurrence of an overflow, but it is usually too late to salvage the proper result at this point.

==Computer language implementations==
Very few computer languages include built-in support for fixed point values, because for most applications, binary or decimal floating-point representations are usually simpler to use and accurate enough. Floating-point representations are easier to use than fixed-point representations, because they can handle a wider dynamic range and do not require programmers to specify the number of digits after the radix point.  However, if they are needed, fixed-point numbers can be implemented even in programming languages like [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], which do not commonly include such support.

A common use of fixed-point [[Binary-coded decimal|BCD]] numbers is for storing monetary values, where the inexact values of binary floating-point numbers are often a liability. Historically, fixed-point representations were the norm for decimal data types; for example, in [[PL/I]] or [[COBOL]]. The [[Ada programming language]] includes built-in support for both fixed-point (binary and decimal) and floating-point. [[JOVIAL programming language|JOVIAL]] and [[Coral 66]] also provide both floating- and fixed-point types.

ISO/IEC TR 18037&lt;ref&gt;JTC1/SC22/WG14, [http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/projects#18037 status of TR 18037: Embedded C]&lt;/ref&gt; specifies fixed-point data types for the C programming language; vendors are expected to implement the language extensions for fixed point arithmetic in coming years. Fixed-point support is implemented in [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]].&lt;ref&gt;GCC wiki, [https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/FixedPointArithmetic Fixed-Point Arithmetic Support]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Using GCC, [https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Fixed-Point.html section 5.13 Fixed-Point Types]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[C Sharp language|C#]] includes a decimal type, which supports a precision of 28-29 significant digits.

[[Python (programming language)|Python]] has included the [https://docs.python.org/2/library/decimal.html decimal] module in its standard libraries since version 2.4 (November, 2004).

Almost all relational [[database]]s, and the [[SQL]], support fixed-point decimal arithmetic and storage of numbers. [[PostgreSQL]] has a special &lt;tt&gt;numeric&lt;/tt&gt; type for exact storage of numbers with up to 1000 digits.&lt;ref&gt;PostgreSQL manual, [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/static/datatype-numeric.html#DATATYPE-NUMERIC-DECIMAL section 8.1.2. Arbitrary Precision Numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software application examples==
{{example farm|section|date=August 2018}}

* [[libfixmath]] is a recent open-source library for the manipulation of fixed point numbers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/libfixmath|title=Google Code Archive - Long-term storage for Google Code Project Hosting.|author=|date=|website=code.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; it currently supports [[Q (number format)|Q16.16]] and [[Q (number format)|Q0.32]] formats and provides an interface similar to [[math.h]].
*The [https://github.com/nestlabs/nlutilities Nest Labs Utilities library], provides a limited set of macros and functions for fixed point numbers, particularly when dealing with those numbers in the context of sensor sampling and sensor outputs.
* [[GnuCash]] is an application for tracking money which is written in C. It switched from a floating-point representation of money to a fixed-point implementation as of version 1.6. This change was made to trade the less predictable rounding errors of floating-point representations for more control over rounding (for example, to the nearest [[Cent (currency)|cent]]).
* [[Tremor (software)|Tremor]], [[Toast (GSM)|Toast]] and [[MPEG Audio Decoder|MAD]] are software libraries which decode the [[Vorbis|Ogg Vorbis]], [[Full Rate|GSM Full Rate]] and [[MP3]] audio formats respectively. These codecs use fixed-point arithmetic because many audio decoding hardware devices do not have an FPU (partly to save money, but primarily to save power - integer units are much smaller in silicon area than an FPU) and audio decoding requires performance to the extent a software implementation of floating-point on low-speed devices would not produce output in real time.
* All [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] engines on Sony's original [[PlayStation]], Sega's [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]], Nintendo's [[Game Boy Advance]] (only [[2D computer graphics|2D]]), [[Nintendo DS]] (2D and 3D), [[Nintendo Gamecube]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2014/03/15/pixel-processing-problems/|title=Dolphin Emulator|author=|date=|website=Dolphin Emulator}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[GP2X Wiz]] video game systems use fixed-point arithmetic for the same reason as Tremor and Toast: to gain throughput on an architecture without an FPU (e.g. the PlayStation included hardware support for 4.12bit values in its transformation coprocessor).
* The [[OpenGL ES]] 1.x specification includes a fixed point profile, as it is an API aimed for embedded systems, which do not always have an FPU.
* [[TeX font metric]] files use 32-bit signed fixed-point numbers, with 12 bits to the left of the decimal, extensively.
* The [[dc (computer program)|dc]] and [[bc programming language|bc]] programs are [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic|arbitrary precision]] calculators, but only keep track of a (user-specified) fixed number of fractional digits.
* [[VisSim]] A visually programmed block diagram language supporting a fixed-point block set to allow simulation and automatic code generation of fixed-point operations. Both word size and radix point can be specified on an operator basis.
* [[Fractint]] represents numbers as [[Q (number format)|Q2.29]] fixed-point numbers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/periodicity.html#integer_math_anchor Fractint, A Little Code]&lt;/ref&gt; to speed up drawing on old PCs with [[Intel 80386|386]] or [[Intel 80486SX|486SX]] processors, which lacked an FPU.
* ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' was the last [[first-person shooter]] title by [[id Software]] to use a 16.16 fixed point representation for all of its non-integer computations, including map system, geometry, rendering, player movement etc. This was done in order for the game to be playable on 386 and 486SX CPUs without an FPU. For compatibility reasons, this representation is still used in modern [[List of Doom source ports|''Doom'' source port]]s.
* [[SystemC]] provides signed and unsigned fixed point data types.
* [[WavPack|Wavpack]] is a fixed-point, lossless audio compressor. Its creator, David Bryant, justifies the decision to implement fixed instead of floating point: " I believe that integer operations are less susceptible to subtle chip to chip variations that could corrupt the lossless nature of the compression."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WavPack Technical Description|url = http://www.wavpack.com/technical.htm|website = www.wavpack.com|accessdate = 2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* fixed point numbers are sometimes used for storing and manipulating images and video frames. Processors with [[SIMD]] units aimed at image processing may include instructions suitable for handling packed fixed point data.

'''Game design''' is the art of applying [[design]] and aesthetics to create a [[game]] for entertainment or for educational, exercise, or experimental purposes. Increasingly, elements and principles of game design are also applied to other interactions, particularly virtual ones (see [[gamification]]).

Game design creates goals, rules and challenges to define a [[board game]], [[card game]], [[dice game]], [[casino game]], [[role-playing game]], [[sport]], [[video game]], [[Wargame (video games)|war game]] or [[simulation]] that produces desirable interactions among its participants and, possibly, spectators.

Academically, game design is part of [[game studies]], while [[game theory]] studies strategic decision making (primarily in non-game situations). Games have historically inspired seminal research in the fields of [[probability]], [[artificial intelligence]], economics, and [[optimization theory]]. Applying game design to itself is a current research topic in [[metadesign]].

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
Sports (see [[history of sports]]), [[gambling]], and [[board games]] are known, respectively, to have existed for at least nine thousand,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20110317/PC20/303179904 Hartsell, Jeff., Wrestling 'in our blood,' says Bulldogs' Luvsandorj, 17 March 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; six thousand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bose|first=M. L.|title=Social And Cultural History Of Ancient India (revised &amp; Enlarged Edition)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_PpdZosif4C&amp;pg=PA179|year=1998|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-81-7022-598-0|page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; and four thousand years.&lt;ref name="Soubeyrand"&gt;{{cite web |last=Soubeyrand |first=Catherine |url=http://www.gamecabinet.com/history/Senet.html |title=The Game of Senet |accessdate=2014-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folk process===
Tabletop games played today whose descent can be traced from ancient times include [[chess]], [[go (game)|go]], [[pachisi]], [[backgammon]], [[mahjong]], [[mancala]], and [[pick-up sticks]]. The rules of these games were not codified until early modern times and their features gradually evolved and changed over time, through the [[folk process]]. Given this, these games are not considered to have had a designer or been the result of a [[design| design process]] in the modern sense.

After the rise of commercial game publishing in the late 19th century, many games which had formerly evolved via folk processes became commercial properties, often with custom scoring pads or preprepared material. For example, the similar public domain games [[Generala]], [[Yacht (dice game)|Yacht]], and [[Yatzy]] led to the commercial game [[Yahtzee]] in the mid-1950s.

Today, many commercial games, such as [[Taboo (game)|Taboo]], [[Balderdash]], [[Pictionary]], or [[Time's Up! (game)|Time's Up!]], are descended from traditional [[parlour games]]. Adapting traditional games to become commercial properties is an example of game design.

Similarly, many sports, such as [[soccer]] and [[baseball]], are the result of folk processes, while others were designed, such as [[basketball]], invented in 1891 by [[James Naismith]].

===New media===
Technological advances have provided new media for games throughout history.

The printing press allowed packs of [[playing cards]], adapted from [[Mahjong]] tiles, to be mass-produced, leading to many new [[card games]]. Accurate topographic maps produced as lithographs and provided free to Prussian officers helped popularize [[wargaming]]. Cheap bookbinding (printed labels wrapped around cardboard) led to mass-produced [[board games]] with custom boards.  Inexpensive (hollow) lead figurine casting contributed to the development of [[miniature wargaming]]. Cheap custom dice led to [[poker dice]]. [[Flying disc]]s led to [[disc golf]] and [[Ultimate (game)|Ultimate]]. [[Personal computers]] contributed to the popularity of [[computer games]], leading to the wide availability of [[video game consoles]] and [[video games]]. [[Smart phones]] have led to a proliferation of [[mobile games]].

The first games in a new medium are frequently adaptations of older games. [[Pong]], one of the first widely disseminated video games, adapted [[table tennis]]. Later games will often exploit distinctive properties of a new medium. Adapting older games and creating original games for new media are both examples of game design.

==Theory==
{{main|Game studies}}
{{off topic|date=May 2017}}
Game studies or gaming theory is a discipline that deals with the critical study of games, game design, players, and their role in society and culture. Prior to the late-twentieth century, the academic study of games was rare and limited to fields such as history and [[anthropology]]. As the video game revolution took off in the early 1980s, so did academic interest in games, resulting in a field that draws on diverse methodologies and schools of thought. These influences may be characterized broadly in three ways: the social science approach, the humanities approach, and the industry and engineering approach.&lt;ref&gt;Konzack, Lars (2007). "Rhetorics of Computer and Video Game Research" in Williams &amp; Smith (ed.) The Players' Realm: Studies on the Culture of Video Games and gaming. McFarland.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, the social scientific approach has concerned itself with the question of "What do games do to people?" Using tools and methods such as surveys, controlled laboratory experiments, and ethnography researchers have investigated both the positive and negative impacts that playing games could have on people.
More sociologically informed research has sought to move away from simplistic ideas of gaming as either 'negative' or 'positive', but rather seeking to understand its role and location in the complexities of everyday life.&lt;ref name="Crawford 2012"&gt;{{cite book| last = Crawford| first=G. |author-link=Garry Crawford | year = 2012| title = Video Gamers| publisher = Routledge |location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general terms, the humanities approach has concerned itself with the question of "What meanings are made through games?" Using tools and methods such as interviews, ethnographies and participant observation, researchers have investigated the various roles that videogames play in people's lives and activities together with the meaning they assign to their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Consalvo, 2007{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an industry perspective, a lot of game studies research can be seen as the academic response to the videogame industry's questions regarding the products it creates and sells. The main question this approach deals with can be summarized as "How can we create better games?" with the accompanying "What makes a game good?" "Good" can be taken to mean many different things, including providing an entertaining and an engaging experience, being easy to learn and play, and being innovative and having novel experiences. Different approaches to studying this problem have included looking at describing how to design games&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Griffiths |first1=M. |year=1999 |title=Violent video games and aggression: A review of the literature |journal=Aggression and violent behavior |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=203–212 |url=http://ocw.metu.edu.tr/pluginfile.php/2352/mod_resource/content/1/Griffiths_LitReview.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126121553/http://ocw.metu.edu.tr/pluginfile.php/2352/mod_resource/content/1/Griffiths_LitReview.pdf |archivedate=26 November 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rollings and Morris, 2000;{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}} Rouse III, 2001{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extracting guidelines and rules of thumb for making better games&lt;ref&gt;Fabricatore et al., 2002;{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}} Falstein, 2004{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategic decision making===
{{main|Game theory}}
Game theory is a study of strategic [[decision making]]. Specifically, it is "the study of [[mathematical model]]s of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers".&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger B. Myerson]] (1991). ''Game Theory: Analysis of Conflict,'' Harvard University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=E8WQFRCsNr0C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA1 1]. Chapter-preview links, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E8WQFRCsNr0C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PR7 vii–xi].&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative term suggested "as a more descriptive name for the discipline" is ''interactive [[decision theory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Aumann|R. J. Aumann]] ([[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics|[1987] ]] 2008). "game theory," Introduction, ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_G000007&amp;q=game%20theory&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=3 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt;
The subject first addressed [[zero-sum game]]s, such that one person's gains exactly equal net losses of the other participant or participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Leonard |first=Robert |title=Von Neumann, Morgenstern, and the Creation of Game Theory |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |isbn=9780521562669 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, however, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and has developed into an [[umbrella term]] for the logical side of decision science.

The games studied in game theory are well-defined mathematical objects. To be fully defined, a game must specify the following elements: the [[Player (game)|''players'' of the game]], the ''information'' and ''actions'' available to each player at each decision point, and the [[Utility|''payoffs'']] for each outcome. (Rasmusen refers to these four "essential elements" by the acronym "PAPI".)&lt;ref name="r7"&gt;• Eric Rasmusen (2007). ''Games and Information'', 4th ed. [http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP001009.html Description] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=5XEMuJwnBmUC&amp;printsec=fnd&amp;pg=PR5 chapter-preview.]&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • [[David M. Kreps]] (1990). ''Game Theory and Economic Modelling''. [http://econpapers.repec.org/bookchap/oxpobooks/9780198283812.htm Description.]&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; • R. Aumann and S. Hart, ed. (1992, 2002). ''Handbook of Game Theory with Economic Applications'' v. 1, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/handbooks/15740005/1 ch. 3–6] and v. 3, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1574000502030060 ch. 43].&lt;/ref&gt; A game theorist typically uses these elements, along with a [[solution concept]] of their choosing, to deduce a set of equilibrium [[Strategy (game theory)|strategies]] for each player such that, when these strategies are employed, no player can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy. These equilibrium strategies determine an [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]] to the game—a stable state in which either one outcome occurs or a set of outcomes occur with known probability.

==Design elements==
Games can be characterized by "what the player does"&lt;ref name="craw"&gt;
{{cite book
|title=[[Chris Crawford on Game Design]]
|isbn=0-88134-117-7
|last=Crawford
|first=Chris

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and what the player experiences. This is often referred to as [[gameplay]]. Major key elements identified in this context are tools and rules that define the overall context of game.

===Tools of play===
Games are often classified by the components required to play them (e.g. [[miniatures game|miniatures]], a [[ball game|ball]], [[card game|card]]s, [[board game|a board and pieces]], or a [[computer game|computer]]). In places where the use of leather is well established, the ball has been a popular game piece throughout recorded history, resulting in a worldwide popularity of ball games such as [[rugby football|rugby]], [[basketball]], [[association football|football]], [[cricket]], [[tennis]], and [[volleyball]]. Other tools are more idiosyncratic to a certain region. Many countries in Europe, for instance, have unique standard decks of [[playing card]]s. Other games such as [[chess]] may be traced primarily through the development and evolution of its game pieces.

Many game tools are tokens, meant to represent other things. A token may be a pawn on a board, [[play money]], or an intangible item such as a point scored.

Games such as [[hide-and-seek]] or [[tag (game)|tag]] do not utilise any obvious tool; rather, their interactivity is defined by the environment. Games with the same or similar rules may have different gameplay if the environment is altered. For example, hide-and-seek in a school building differs from the same game in a park; an [[auto race]] can be radically different depending on the [[race track|track]] or [[street racing|street]] course, even with the same cars.

===Rule development===
{{see also|Game mechanics|gameplay|balance (game design)}}

Whereas games are often characterized by their tools, they are often defined by their rules. While rules are [[house rules|subject to variations and changes]], enough change in the rules usually results in a "new" game. There are exceptions to this in that some games deliberately involve the changing of their own rules, but even then there are often immutable [[meta]]-rules.

Rules generally determine turn order, the rights and responsibilities of the players, each player's goals, and how game components interact with each other in to produce changes in a game's state. Player rights may include when they may spend resources or move tokens.

====Victory conditions====
Common win conditions are being first to amass a certain quota of points or tokens (as in [[Settlers of Catan]]), having the greatest number of tokens at the end of the game (as in [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]), some relationship of one's game tokens to those of one's opponent (as in chess's [[checkmate]]), or reaching a certain point in a storyline (as in most roleplay-games).

===Single or multiplayer===
Most games require multiple players. Single-player games are unique in respect to the type of challenges a player faces. Unlike a game with multiple players competing with or against each other to reach the game's goal, a single-player game is against an element of the environment, against one's own skills, against time, or against chance. This is also true of [[cooperative games]], in which multiple players share a common goal and win or lose together.

Many games described as "single-player" or "cooperative" could alternatively be described as puzzles or recreations, in that they do not involve strategic behavior (as defined by game theory), in which the expected reaction of an opponent to a possible move becomes a factor in choosing which move to make.

Games against opponents simulated with [[artificial intelligence]] differ from other single-player games in that the algorithms used usually do incorporate strategic behavior.

===Storyline and plot===
Stories told in games may focus on narrative elements that can be communicated through the use of mechanics and player choice. Narrative plots in games generally have a clearly defined and simplistic structure. Mechanical choices on the part of the designer(s) often drastically effect narrative elements in the game. However, due to a lack of unified and standardized teaching and understanding of narrative elements in games, individual interpretations, methods, and terminology vary wildly. Because of this, most narrative elements in games are created unconsciously and intuitively. However, as a general rule, game narratives increase in complexity and scale as player choice or game mechanics increase in complexity and scale. One example of this is removing a players ability to directly affect the plot for a limited time. This lack of player choice necessitates an increase in mechanical complexity, and could be used as a metaphor to symbolize depression that is felt by a character in the narrative.

===Luck and strategy===
A game's tools and rules will result in its requiring skill, strategy, [[luck]], or a combination thereof, and are classified accordingly.

[[Games of skill]] include games of physical skill, such as [[wrestling]], [[tug of war]], [[hopscotch]], [[shooting sport|target shooting]], and [[horseshoes]], and games of mental skill such as [[checkers]] and [[chess]]. [[Games of strategy]] include checkers, chess, [[go (board game)|go]], [[arimaa]], and [[tic-tac-toe]], and often require special equipment to play them. [[Games of chance]] include gambling games ([[blackjack]], [[mah-jongg]], [[roulette]], etc.), as well as [[snakes and ladders]] and [[rock, paper, scissors]]; most require equipment such as cards or [[dice]].

Most games contain two or all three of these elements. For example, [[American football]] and baseball involve both physical skill and strategy while [[tiddlywinks]], [[poker]], and [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] combine strategy and chance. Many card and board games combine all three; most [[trick-taking game]]s involve mental skill, strategy, and an element of chance, as do many strategic board games such as [[Risk (game)|Risk]], [[Settlers of Catan]], and [[Carcassonne (board game)|Carcassonne]].

===Use as educational tool===
{{Further|Learning through play}}
By learning through play{{efn|a term used in education and [[psychology]] to describe how a child can learn to make sense of the world around them}} children can develop social and [[Cognition|cognitive]] skills, mature emotionally, and gain the [[self-confidence]] required to engage in new experiences and environments.&lt;ref&gt;Human growth and the development of personality, Jack Kahn, Susan Elinor Wright, [[Pergamon Press]], {{ISBN|978-1-59486-068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Key ways that young children learn include playing, being with other people, being active, exploring and new experiences, talking to themselves, communication with others, meeting physical and mental challenges, being shown how to do new things, practicing and repeating skills and having fun.&lt;ref&gt;Learning, playing and interacting. Good practice in early years foundation stage. Page 9{{full citation needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Play develops children's content knowledge and provides children the opportunity to develop social skills, competences and disposition to learn.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, E. and J. Attfield. (2005). Play, learning and the early childhood curriculum. 2nd ed. London: Paul Chapman&lt;/ref&gt;  Play-based learning is based on a Vygotskian model of [[scaffolding]] where the teacher pays attention on specific elements of the play activity and provides encouragement and feedback on children's learning.&lt;ref name="text2"&gt;Martlew, J., Stephen, C. &amp; Ellis, J. (2011). Play in the primary school classroom? The experience of teachers supporting children's learning through a new pedagogy. Early Years, 31(1), 71–83.&lt;/ref&gt; When children engage in real-life and imaginary activities, play can be challenging in children's thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Whitebread, D., Coltman, P., Jameson, H. &amp; Lander, R. (2009). Play, cognition and self regulation: What exactly are children learning when they learn through play? Educational &amp; Child Psychology, 26(2), 40–52.&lt;/ref&gt; To extend the learning process, sensitive intervention can be provided with adult support when necessary during play-based learning.&lt;ref name="text2" /&gt;

==Development process==
Game design is part of a game's development from concept to its final form. Typically, the development process is an [[iterative]] process, with repeated phases of testing and revision. During revision, additional design or re-design may be needed.

===Development team===
{{anchor|Game designer}}

====Game designer====
A game designer (or inventor) is the person who invents a game's concept, its central mechanisms, and its rules.

Often, the game designer also invents the game's title and, if the game isn't abstract, its theme. Sometimes these activities are done by the game publisher, not the designer, or may be dictated by a licensed property (such as when designing a game based on a film).

====Game developer====
A game developer is the person who fleshes out the details of a game's design, oversees its testing, and revises the game in response to player feedback.

Often the game designer is also its developer, although some publishers do extensive development of games to suit their particular target audience after licensing a game from a designer. For larger games, such as [[collectible card games]] and most video games, a team is used and the designer and developer roles are usually split among multiple people.

====Game artist====
{{main|Game artist}}
A game artist is an artist who creates art for one or more types of games.

Many graphic elements of games are created by the designer when producing a prototype of the game, revised by the developer based on testing, and then further refined by the artist and combined with artwork as a game is prepared for publication or release.

For video games, game artists are responsible for all of the aspects of [[game development]] that call for [[visual art]].&lt;ref name="gamespot"&gt;[http://uk.gamespot.com/features/so-you-want-to-be-an-artist-6144426/ Gamespot UK – So You Want To Be An: Artist] – Accessed 17 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Game artists are often vital to and credited in [[role-playing game]]s, [[collectible card game]]s and video games.&lt;ref name="artofvideogames"&gt;[http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/ Exhibitions: The Art of Video Games] – Accessed 17 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concept===
A game concept is an idea for a game, briefly describing its core play mechanisms, who the players represent, and how they win or lose.

A game concept may be "pitched" to a game publisher in a similar manner as film ideas are [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitched]] to potential film producers. Alternatively, game publishers holding a game [[license]] to [[intellectual property]] in other media may solicit game concepts from several designers before picking one to design a game, typically paying the designer in advance against future [[royalties]].

===Design===
During design, a game concept is fleshed out. Mechanisms are specified in terms of components (boards, cards, on-screen entities, etc.) and rules. The play sequence and possible player actions are defined, as well as how the game starts, ends, and what is its winning condition. In video games, [[storyboards]] and screen mockups may be created.

===Prototype===
A game prototype is a draft version of a game used for testing. Typically, creating a prototype marks the shift from game design to game development and testing. Although prototyping in regards to human-computer interaction and interaction design are both studied, the use of prototyping in game design has remained relatively unexplored. It's known that game design has clear benefits from prototyping, such as exploring new game design possibilities and technologies, the field of game design has different characteristics than other types of software industries that considers prototyping in game design in a different category and need a new perspective&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265974873_Prototyping_in_Game_Design_Externalization_and_Internalization_of_Game_Ideas|title=(PDF) Prototyping in Game Design: Externalization and Internalization of Game Ideas|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Testing===
Game testing is a major part of game development. During testing, players play the game and provide feedback on its gameplay, the usability of its components or screen elements, the clarity of its goals and rules, ease of learning, and enjoyment to the game developer. The developer then revises the design, its components, presentation, and rules before testing it again. Later testing may take place with [[focus groups]] to test consumer reactions before publication.

During testing, various [[balance (game design)|balance]] issues may be identified, requiring changes to the game's design.

[[Game testing|Video game testing]] is a [[software testing]] process for [[quality control]] of video games.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bates|Bates 2004]], pp. 176–180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Novak95"&gt;[[#MoNov|Moore, Novak 2010]], p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxland3012"&gt;[[#Oxland|Oxland 2004]], p. 301-302&lt;/ref&gt; The primary function of game testing is the discovery and documentation of [[Software bug|software defect]]s (aka bugs). Interactive entertainment software testing is a highly technical field requiring [[computing]] expertise, analytic competence, critical evaluation skills, and endurance.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bates|Bates 2004]], pp. 178, 180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxland301"&gt;[[#Oxland|Oxland 2004]], p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
Different types of games pose different game design issues.

===Board games===
[[File:DarrowPage1.png|thumb|235px|[[Charles Darrow]]'s 1935 patent for ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' includes specific design elements developed during the prototype phase. Prototypes are very common in the later stages of board game design, and "prototype circles" in many cities today provide an opportunity for designers to play and critique each other's games.&lt;ref name=neyfakh/&gt;&lt;ref name=wadley/&gt;]]
[[Board game]] design is the development of rules and presentational aspects of a board game. When a player takes part in a game, it is the player's self-subjection to the rules that creates a sense of purpose for the duration of the game.&lt;ref name=neyfakh&gt;Neyfakh, Leon. "Quest for fun; Sometimes the most addictive new technology comes in a simple cardboard box". ''[[Boston Globe]]''. 11 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining the players' interest throughout the gameplay experience is the goal of board game design.&lt;ref name=wadley&gt;Wadley, Carma. "Rules of the game: Do you have what it takes to invent the next 'Monopoly'?" ''[[Deseret News]]''. 18 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve this, board game designers emphasize different aspects such as social interaction, strategy, and competition, and target players of differing needs by providing for short versus long-play, and luck versus skill.&lt;ref name=wadley/&gt; Beyond this, board game design reflects the culture in which the board game is produced.

The most ancient board games known today are over 5000 years old. They are frequently [[abstract strategy game|abstract]] in character and their design is primarily focused on a core set of simple rules. Of those that are still played today, games like [[go (game)|go]] (c.400BC), [[mancala]] (c.700AD), and [[chess]] (c.600AD) have gone through many presentational and/or rule variations. In the case of chess, for example, [[chess variants|new variants]] are developed constantly, to focus on certain aspects of the game, or just for variation's sake.

Traditional board games date from the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Whereas ancient board game design was primarily focused on rules alone, traditional board games were often influenced by [[Victorian era|Victorian]] mores. Academic (e.g. history and geography) and moral didacticism were important design features for traditional games, and [[Puritan]] associations between dice and the [[Devil]] meant that early American game designers eschewed their use in board games entirely.&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;Johnson, Bruce E. "Board games: affordable and abundant, boxed amusements from the 1930s and '40s recall the cultural climate of an era." ''[[Country Living]]''. 1 December 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Even traditional games that did use dice, like ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' (based on the 1906 ''[[The Landlord's Game]]''), were rooted in educational efforts to explain political concepts to the masses. By the 1930s and 1940s, board game design began to emphasize amusement over education, and characters from comic strips, radio programmes, and (in the 1950s) television shows began to be featured in board game adaptations.&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;

Recent developments in modern board game design can be traced to the 1980s in Germany, and have led to increased popularity of "[[German-style board game]]s" (also known as "Eurogames" or "designer games"). The design emphasis of these board games is to give players meaningful choices.&lt;ref name=neyfakh/&gt; This is manifested by eliminating elements like randomness and luck to be replaced by skill, strategy, and resource competition, by removing the potential for players to fall irreversibly behind in the early stages of a game, and by reducing the number of rules and possible player options to produce what [[Alan R. Moon]] has described as "elegant game design".&lt;ref name=neyfakh/&gt; The concept of elegant game design has been identified by ''[[The Boston Globe]]'''s Leon Neyfakh as related to [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]'s concept of "[[flow (psychology)|flow]]" from his 1990 book, "Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience".&lt;ref name=neyfakh/&gt;

Modern technological advances have had a democratizing effect on board game production, with services like [[Kickstarter]] providing designers with essential startup capital and tools like [[3D Printing|3D printers]] facilitating the production of game pieces and board game prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;Whigfield, Nick. "Video Hasn't Killed Interest in Board Games ; New Technologies Have Contributed to Revival of Tabletop Entertainment". ''[[The Irish Times]]''. 12 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, Monica. "Rolling the dice on a jolly good pastime". ''[[The Washington Post]]''. 29 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A modern adaptation of figure games are [[miniature wargame]]s like ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]''.

===Card games===
[[Card game]]s include games with cards that are custom-tailored to the game, as in many modern games, as well as those whose design is constricted by the type of the [[deck of cards]], like [[Tarot]] or the [[Suit (cards)|four-suited]] Latin decks. Card games can be played for fun, such as [[Go Fish]], or as gambling games, such as [[Poker]].

In Asian cultures, special sets of tiles can serve the same function as cards, as in [[mahjong]], a game similar to (and thought to be the distant ancestor of) the Western card game [[rummy]]. Western [[dominoes]] games are believed to have developed from Asian tile games in the 18th century.

''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' was the first [[collectible card game]] (or "trading card game") in 1993.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The line between card and board games is not clear-cut, as many card games, such as [[solitaire]], involve playing cards to form a "tableau", a spatial layout or board. Many board games, in turn, uses specialized cards to provide random events, such as the Chance cards of [[Monopoly (game)]], or as the central mechanism driving play, as in many [[Board wargame#Card-driven|card-driven wargames]].

As cards are typically shuffled and revealed gradually during play, most card games involve randomness, either initially or during play, and hidden information, such as the cards in a player's hand.  This is in contrast to many board games, in which most of the game's current state is visible to all participants, even though players may also have a small amount of private information, such as the letter tiles on each player's rack during [[Scrabble]].

How players play their cards, revealing information and interacting with previous plays as they do so, is central to card game design. In partnership card games, such as [[Contract Bridge|Bridge]], rules limiting communication between players on the same team become an important part of the game design. This idea of limited communication has been extended to cooperative card games, such as [[Hanabi (card game)|Hanabi]].

===Dice games===
[[File:Pokerwürfel.jpg|thumb|right|A set of [[poker dice]] and a dice cup]]

[[Dice game]]s are among the oldest known games and have often been associated with gambling. Non-gambling dice games, such as [[Yatzy]], [[Poker dice]], or [[Yahtzee]] became popular in the mid-20th century.

The line between dice and board games is not clear-cut, as dice are often used as randomization devices in board games, such as Monopoly or [[Risk]], while serving as the central drivers of play in games such as [[Backgammon]] or [[Pachisi]].

Dice games differ from card games in that each throw of the dice is an [[independent event]], whereas the odds of a given card being drawn is affected by all the previous cards drawn or revealed from a deck. Dice game design often centers around forming scoring combinations and managing re-rolls, either by limiting their number, as in Yahtzee, or by introducing a press-your-luck element, as in [[Can't Stop (board game)|Can't Stop]].

===Casino games===
{{See also|House edge}}
[[File:Slot machine.jpg|thumb|All casino games are designed to mathematically favor the house. The [[house edge]] for a [[slot machine]] can range widely between 2 and 15 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Shackleford|Shackleford, Michael]]. "[http://wizardofodds.com/gambling/house-edge House Edge of casino games compared]". Wizardofodds.com. Retrieved 9 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Casino game]] design can entail the creation of an entirely new casino game, the creation of a variation on an existing casino game, or the creation of a new [[side bet]] on an existing casino game.&lt;ref name=lubin&gt;Lubin, Dan. "Casino Game Design: From Cocktail Napkin Sketch to Casino Floor". Available: [http://gamingmath.com/misc/casino-game-design.pdf]. Retrieved 13 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Casino game mathematician, [[Michael Shackleford]] has noted that it is much more common for casino game designers today to make successful variations than entirely new casino games.&lt;ref name=shackleford&gt;[[Michael Shackleford|Shackleford, Michael]]. "[http://wizardofodds.com/gambling/ten-commandments-game-inventors Ten Commandments for Game Inventors]". Wizardofodds.com. Retrieved 13 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Gambling columnist [[John Grochowski]] points to the emergence of community-style [[slot machine]]s in the mid-1990s, for example, as a successful variation on an existing casino game type.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Grochowski|Grochowski, John]]. "Gaming Guru: Tracing Back the Roots of Some Popular Gaming Machines at Casinos". ''[[The Press of Atlantic City]]''. 28 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the majority of other games which are designed primarily in the interest of the player, one of the central aims of casino game design is to optimize the [[house advantage]] and maximize revenue from [[gambler]]s. Successful casino game design works to provide entertainment for the player and revenue for the gambling house.

To maximise player entertainment, casino games are designed with simple easy-to-learn rules that emphasize winning (i.e. whose rules enumerate many victory conditions and few loss conditions&lt;ref name=shackleford/&gt;), and that provide players with a variety of different gameplay postures (e.g. [[Hand (card games)|card hands]]).&lt;ref name=lubin/&gt; Player entertainment value is also enhanced by providing gamblers with familiar gaming elements (e.g. dice and cards) in new casino games.&lt;ref name=lubin/&gt;&lt;ref name=shackleford/&gt;

To maximise success for the gambling house, casino games are designed to be easy for [[croupier]]s to operate and for [[pit manager]]s to oversee.&lt;ref name=lubin/&gt;&lt;ref name=shackleford/&gt;

The two most fundamental rules of casino game design is that the games must be non-fraudable&lt;ref name=lubin/&gt; (including being as nearly as possible immune from [[advantage gambling]]&lt;ref name=shackleford/&gt;), and that they must mathematically favor the house winning. Shackleford suggests that the optimum casino game design should give the house an edge of smaller than 5%.&lt;ref name=shackleford/&gt;

===Role-playing games===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
{{see also|List of role-playing game designers}}

The design of role-playing games requires the establishment of [[Campaign setting|setting]], [[Character creation|characters]], and basic [[role-playing game system|gameplay rules or mechanics]]. After a role-playing game is produced, additional design elements are often devised by the players themselves. In many instances, for example, [[character creation]] is left to the players. Likewise, the progression of a role-playing game is determined in large part by the [[gamemaster]] whose individual campaign design may be directed by one of several [[role-playing game theory|role-playing game theories]].

There is no central core for [[tabletop role-playing game]] theory because different people want such different things out of the games.  Probably the most famous category of RPG theory, [[GNS Theory]] assumes that people want one of three things out of the game – a better, more interestingly challenging game, to create a more interesting [[narrative|story]], or a better simulation – in other words better rules to support [[worldbuilding]]. GNS Theory has been abandoned by its creator, partly because it neglects emotional investment, and partly because it just didn't work properly. There are techniques that people use (such as [[dice pool]]s) to better create the game they want – but with no consistent goal or agreement for what makes for a good game there's no overarching theory generally agreed on.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

[[Image:Battle for Mandicor 0.0.5.png|thumb|Video game [[Software prototyping|prototypes]] created during the pre-production design phase are often used as a [[proof of concept]] for the implementation of new rules or gameplay features.]]
Video game design is a process that takes place in the [[Game development#Pre-production|pre-production]] phase of video game development. In the video game industry, game design describes the creation of the content and rules of a video game.&lt;ref name=Brathwaite&gt;{{cite book | title=Challenges for Game Designers | last1=Brathwaite | first1=Brenda | authorlink1 = Brenda Brathwaite | last2=Schreiber | first2=Ian | pages=2–5 | year=2009 | publisher=Charles River Media | isbn=158450580X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of this process for the game designer is to provide players with the opportunity to make meaningful decisions in relation to playing the game.&lt;ref name=Brathwaite/&gt; [[Video game design#Game elements|Elements of video game design]] such as the establishment of fundamental [[gameplay]] rules provide a framework within which players will operate, while the addition of narrative structures provide players with a reason to care about playing the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Video Game Design Revealed | last=Lecky-Thompson | first=Guy W. | pages=43–45 | year=2008 | publisher=Cengage Learning | isbn=1584506075 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To establish the rules and narrative, an internally consistent [[game world]] is created, requiring visual, audio, and programming development for world, [[Characterization|character]], and [[level design]]. The amount of work that is required to accomplish this often demands the use of a design team which may be divided into smaller [[Video game design#Disciplines|game design disciplines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Ultimate Guide to Video Game Writing and Design | last1=Dille | first1=Flint | authorlink1 = Flint Dille |last2=Platten | first2=John Zuur| pages=137–149 | year=2007 | publisher=Lone Eagle | isbn=158065066X }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to maintain internal consistency between the teams, a specialized [[software design document]] known as a "[[game design document]]" (and sometimes an even broader scope "game bible" document) provides overall contextual guidance on ambient mood, appropriate tone, and other less tangible aspects of the game world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Level Up!: The Guide to Great Video Game Design | last1=Rogers | first1=Scott | pages=57–81 | year=2010 | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | isbn=0470970928 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===War games===
{{expand section|date=May 2014}}
[[File:HG Wells playing to Little Wars.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[H. G. Wells]] playing ''[[Little Wars]]'']]

The first military [[Wargaming|war games]], or [[Kriegsspiel (wargame)|Kriegsspiel]], were designed in [[Prussia]] in the 19th century to train staff officers.&lt;ref name="KRIEG"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/spielzeug/0,1518,625745,00.html|title=Wie preußische Militärs den Rollenspiel-Ahnen erfanden|last=Lischka|first=Konrad|date=22 June 2009|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|language=German|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also [[Wargaming|played as a hobby for entertainment]].

Modern war games are designed to test [[military doctrine|doctrines]], [[Military strategy|strategies]] and [[Military tactics|tactics]] in full scale exercises with [[opposing force]]s at venues like the [[National Training Center|NTC]], [[Fort Polk#JRTC moves to Polk|JRTC]] and the [[Joint Multinational Readiness Center|JMRC]], involving [[NATO]] countries.

Lewis was born in [[Boston]]{{r|cv}} and grew up in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley, {{shy|Massa|chu|setts}}]].{{r|defended}} His parents were physicians{{snd}}his father a hospital chief of [[anesthesiology]] and his mother the head of the [[Dever State School]] for [[Intellectual disability|{{shy|intel|lec|tu|ally}} disabled children]].{{r|dever}} His father was a [[World War II]] veteran and the son of a [[German people|German]] [[Lutheran]] father and a [[Russian Jews|Russian Jewish]] mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lewis  |first=Harry R. |authorlink=   |title= 2002: America and the Curricular Review  |publisher=[[Harvard University]]|date=2002 |url= https://lewis.seas.harvard.edu/pages/2002-america-and-curricular-review |quote=My father, the son of a German Lutheran immigrant on one side and a Russian Jewish immigrant on the other, must have wondered who precisely were the vanquished and rescued individuals he encountered while he was in the Army in Europe.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating ''[[summa cum laude]]'' at the end of the eleventh grade at Boston's [[Roxbury Latin School]] he entered Harvard College, where he was for a time a third-string [[lacrosse]] goalie.{{r|defended}}

Lewis has said that he discovered "I wasn't a real {{shy|math|e|ma|ti|cian}} [once] I got out of the amateur leagues of high school mathematics", but was "tremendously excited" by the computer-science research {{shy|oppor|tu|nities}} at Harvard.{{ran|L2}}
As a senior he lectured a graduate class using a computer-graphics program, SHAPE{{shy}}SHIFTER, which he had developed for displaying [[complex plane|complex-plane]] {{shy|trans|for|ma|tions}} on a [[cathode ray tube]]. SHAPE{{shy}}SHIFTER automatically recognized formulas and commands hand-entered via a stylus on a [[RAND tablet]], and could be "trained" to recognize the handwriting of individual users.{{r|stops}}{{r|graphics}}
There being no degree program in computer science ''per se'' at Harvard at the time,{{ran|L2}} in 1968 Lewis received his BA (''summa'', [[Quincy House (Harvard)|Quincy House]]) in [[applied mathematics]]{{r|bradley}}{{r|diversity}} and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]].{{r|pbk}}

After two years as a mathematician and computer scientist for the [[National Institutes of Health]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]],
he spent a year in Europe as a [[Frederick Sheldon Traveling Fellow]].
He then returned to Harvard, where he earned his M.A. in 1973 and PhD in 1974, after which he was immediately appointed Assistant Professor of Computer Science. He became an Associate Professor in 1978, and has been [[Gordon McKay#legacy|Gordon McKay]] Professor of Computer Science since 1981.{{r|cv}}

Lewis plans to retire in 2020,{{r|retiring}} at which time a new professorship in Engineering and Applied Sciences, endowed by former student Larry Lebowitz, will be named for Lewis and for his wife Marlyn McGrath, who is Harvard's director of admissions.{{r|lebowitz}}

Lewis has pointed out that{{snd}}largely because his career began when the field of computer science "barely existed", and Harvard offered almost no computer science courses at the undergraduate level{{snd}}he originated almost all the courses he has taught.{{r|bits_odd}} It was his proposal, in the late 1970s, that Harvard create a major specifically for computer science{{r|major}}
(which until then had been a branch of Harvard's applied mathematics program).{{ran|L2}}

From 2003 to 2008 he was designated a Harvard College Professor in recognition of "particularly distinguished contributions to undergraduate teaching".{{r|hcp}}
Six of his teaching assistants{{r|TFs}} are now members of the Harvard faculty{{r|bits_odd}} and many others are professors of computer science (or related disciplines) elsewhere;{{r|bits_30th}}
many have gone on to win teaching awards themselves, including [[Eric S. Roberts|Eric Roberts]] ([[Association for Computing Machinery]] Karlstrom Award),{{r|karlstrom}} Nicholas Horton ([[Robert V. Hogg]] Award),{{r|sigmaa}} Joseph A. Konstan (University of Minnesota Distinguished University Teaching Professor, Graduate/Professional Teaching Award),{{r|jkonaw}} and [[Margo Seltzer]] ([[Herchel Smith]] Professor of Computer Science at Harvard, [[Phi Beta Kappa]] teaching award, Abramson Teaching Award).{{r|seltzer}}

His undergraduate students have included [[Mark Zuckerberg]] (whose website "Six Degrees to Harry Lewis" was a precursor to [[Facebook]]{{snd}}''six degrees'' being a reference to the [[Six degrees of separation#Kevin Bacon game|small world hypothesis]]),{{refn|group=Note|name=zuck|In 2004 Zuckerberg wrote to Lewis,
:Professor, I've been interested in graph theory and its applications to social networks for a while now, so I did some research{{nbsp}} ... that has to do with linking people through articles they appear in from [''[[The Crimson]]'', the Harvard student newspaper]. I thought people would find this interesting, so I've set up a preliminary site that allows people to find the connection (through people and articles) from any person to the most frequently mentioned person in the time frame I looked at. That person is you.{{paragraph break}}I wanted to ask your permission to put this site up though, since it has your name in its title.

After some discussion Lewis gave his approval: "Sure, what the hell. Seems harmless."{{r|facebook_bundle}}

Lewis is the author or coauthor of three undergraduate textbooks:
*''An Introduction to Computer Programming and Data Structures using MACRO-11'' (1981).{{ran|L81}} [[MACRO-11]] was an [[assembly language]] for [[PDP-11]] computers.
*''Elements of the Theory of Computation'' (1981, with [[Christos H. Papadimitriou]]){{ran|LP81}} covers [[automata theory]], [[computational complexity theory]], and the theory of [[formal language]]s;&lt;!--this is from Greenleaf--&gt; its inclusion of complexity theory and [[mathematical logic]] was innovative for its time.&lt;!--this is from Gallier--&gt; It has been called an "excellent traditional text" but one whose terse and heavily mathematical style can be intimidating.&lt;!--this is from Greenleaf--&gt; Although intended for undergraduates, it has also been used for introductory graduate courses.&lt;!--this is from Gallier--&gt;
*''Data Structures and Their Algorithms'' (1991, with Larry Denenberg).{{ran|LD}}

Lewis also teaches a course on amateur athletics and the social history of sports in America.{{r|cv}}

==Dean of Harvard College==

Future Harvard professor [[Margo Seltzer]] is at left.}}{{r|bits_30th}} ]]

In 1994 Lewis coauthored the "comprehensive" ''Report on the Structure of Harvard College'',{{r|constructing}}{{r|structure}} and in 1995{{r|hcp}} he was appointed dean of Harvard College, responsible for the nonacademic aspects of undergraduate life.{{r|forced}} In that capacity he oversaw a number of sometimes-controversial policy changes, including changes to the handling of allegations of sexual assault, reorganization of the college's public-service programs, a crackdown on underage alcohol use, and random assignment of students to upperclass houses (countering the social segregation found under the prior system of assignment according to student preference).{{refn|group=Note|See [[Harvard College#house system|Harvard College §{{nbsp}}House system]].}}{{r|bradley}}{{r|trying}}
He also pressed improvements to advising and health care.{{r|bradley}}{{r|conclude}}{{r|deconstructing}}
A colleague has said that Lewis "reshaped undergraduate life more powerfully than anyone else in recent memory."{{r|someday}}

After the 2001 inauguration of [[Harvard University]]'s twenty-seventh president, [[Lawrence Summers#Harvard president|Lawrence Summers]], Lewis and Summers came into conflict over the direction of the College and its educational philosophy.{{r|bradley}}{{r|departure}}{{r|constructing}}{{r|philosophy_bundle}} Lewis, for example, emphasized the importance of extracurricular pursuits, advising incoming freshmen that "flexibility in your schedule, unstructured time in your day, and evenings spent with your friends rather than your books are all, in a larger sense, essential for your education", while Summers complained of an insufficiently intellectual "Camp Harvard" and admonished students that "You are here to work, and your business here is to learn."{{r|x168}}{{ran|L06|pp=86-90}}{{ran|L1}} After Lewis issued what ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' called "a scathing indictment of the view that increasing intellectual rigor ought to be the [College's] priority"{{snd}}pointing out that prospective employers show less interest in grades than in personal qualities built outside the classroom{{r|departure}}{{snd}}he was peremptorily removed as dean in March 2003.{{r|departure}}{{r|debunking}}{{r|deconstructing}}{{r|bradley}}

Lewis continued to teach throughout his time as dean.{{r|hcp}} In 2015 he served as interim Dean of the [[Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences]].{{r|newdean}}

==Writings on education and technology==

Lewis is a Faculty Associate of Harvard's [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]].{{r|cyberlaw}}
In addition to his research publications and textbooks, he has written a number of works on higher education and the impact of computers on society.

Drawing heavily on his experience as dean of Harvard College, his ''[[Excellence Without a Soul|Excellence Without A Soul: How a Great University Forgot Education]]'' (2006) critiques what he sees as the abandonment by American universities, including Harvard, of the
{{quote|fundamental job of [[undergraduate education]]{{nbsp}} ... to turn eighteen- and nineteen-year-olds into twenty-one- and twenty-two-year-olds, to help them grow up, to learn who they are, to search for a larger purpose for their lives, and to leave college as better human beings.{{ran|L06|p=xii}}
}}
In "Renewing the Civic Mission of American Higher Education" (with Ellen Condliffe Lagemann, 2012) Lewis warns that "a flourishing multiplicity of worthy but uncoordinated agendas has crowded out higher education's commitment to the common good":
{{quote|{{shy|The ongoing erosion of civic concerns within American higher education is alarming and dangerous{{nbsp}} ... [Colleges] are a natural place for citizens to learn values beyond their own personal welfare, to see themselves as part of a society of mutual rights and respon|si|bil|i|ties. They should be settings in which engagement with questions concerning justice and goodness is essential to daily routines{{nbsp}} ... Effective civic education must simul|ta|ne|ously involve students' capacities for thinking intel|lec|tu|ally, for making moral judgments, and for [taking action in response to those judgments]{{nbsp}} ... Free societies will not thrive unless colleges, graduate schools, and pro|fes|sional schools understand that the civic health of the nation is one of their central respon|si|bil|ities.}}{{wbr}}{{ran|LL|p=10-11}} }}

Developed from a course taught by its authors,
''Blown to Bits: Your Life, Liberty, and Happiness After the Digital Explosion'' (2008, with [[Hal Abelson]] and [[Ken Ledeen]]) explores the origins and consequences of the 21st-century explosion in digital information, including its impact on culture and privacy:
{{quote|It is now possible, in principle, to remember everything that anyone says, writes, sings, draws, or photographs. ''Everything''&lt;!-- If digitized, the world has enough disks and memory chips to save it all, for as long as civilization can keep producing computers and disk drives.--&gt;{{nbsp}} ... Global computer networks can make it available to everywhere in the world, almost instantly. And computers are powerful enough to extract meaning from all that information, to find patterns and make connections in the blink of an eye.{{paragraph break}}In centuries gone by, others may have dreamed these things could happen, in utopian fantasies or in nightmares. But now they are happening.{{ran|ALL|p=xiii}} }}

''Baseball as a Second Language: Explaining the Game Americans Use to Explain Everything Else'' (self-published as an experiment in [[open access]] in 2011){{r|bits_baseball}} discusses the many ways baseball concepts and imagery have made their way into American English.{{r|branca}} It was inspired by Lewis' experiences explaining baseball to international students.{{r|bits_baseball}}

==Research==
[[File:HarryLewis_Harvard_OfficeKnickKnacks.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Lewis in his office (2016)]]

Lewis' undergraduate thesis describing SHAPESHIFTER, "Two applications of hand-printed two-dimensional computer input",{{ran|L68}} was written under [[computer graphics]] pioneer [[Ivan Sutherland]]{{r|cv}}
and presented at the 23rd National Conference of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] in 1968.
It was followed by several papers on related topics.{{r|graphics}}

Much of Lewis' subsequent research concerned the [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of problems in [[mathematical logic]].
His doctoral thesis, "Herbrand Expansions and Reductions of the [[Entscheidungsproblem|Decision Problem]]", was supervised by [[Burton Dreben]] and dealt with [[Herbrand's theorem]].{{r|cv}}{{r|mathgen}}
His 1979 book, ''Unsolvable classes of quantificational formulas''{{ran|L79}}
complemented ''The Decision Problem: Solvable classes of quantificational formula'' by Dreben and [[Warren Goldfarb]].{{r|DG}}

His 1978 paper "Renaming a set of clauses as a Horn set" addressed the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], of determining whether a logic formula in [[conjunctive normal form]] can be made true by a suitable assignment of its variables. In general, these problems are hard, but there are two major subclasses of satisfiability for which [[polynomial time]] solutions are known: [[2-satisfiability]] (where each clause of the formula has two literals) and [[Horn-satisfiability]] (where each clause has at most one positive literal). Lewis expanded the second of these subclasses, by showing that the problem can still be solved in polynomial time
when the input is not already in Horn form, but can be put into Horn form by replacing some variables by their negations. The problem of choosing which variables to negate to make each clause get two positive literals, making the re-signed instance into a Horn set, turns out to be expressible as an instance of 2-satisfiability, the other solvable case of the satisfiability problem. By solving a 2-satisfiability instance to turn the given input into a Horn set, Lewis shows that the instances that can be turned into Horn sets can also be solved in polynomial time.{{ran|L78}} The time for the sign reassignment in the original version of what Lindhorst and Shahrokhi called "this elegant result"{{r|linsha}} was {{math|''O''{{hsp}}(''mn''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} for an instance with {{mvar|m}} clauses and {{mvar|n}} variables, but it can be reduced to [[linear time]] by breaking long input clauses into smaller clauses and applying a faster 2-satisfiability algorithm.{{r|aspvall}}

Lewis' paper "Complexity results for classes of quantificational formulas" (1980) deals with the computational complexity of problems in [[first-order logic]]. Such problems are [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] in general, but there are several special classes of these problems, defined by restricting the order in which their quantifiers appear, that were known to be decidable. One of these special classes, for instance, is the [[Bernays–Schönfinkel class]]. For each of these special classes, Lewis establishes tight
exponential time bounds either for [[DTIME|deterministic]] or [[NTIME|nondeterministic time complexity]]. For instance, he shows that the Bernays–Schönfinkel class is [[NEXPTIME]]-complete, and more specifically that its nondeterministic time complexity is both upper- and lower-bounded by a singly exponential function of the input length.{{ran|L80}}
[[Egon Börger|Börger]], Grädel, and [[Yuri Gurevich|Gurevich]] write that "this paper initiated the study of the complexity of decidable classes of the decision problem".{{r|bgg}}

"A logic of concrete time intervals" (1990) concerned [[temporal logic]].{{ran|L90}} This paper accompanied an earlier Aiken Computation Laboratory technical report, "Finite-state analysis of asynchronous circuits with bounded temporal uncertainty", where he first proposed the representation of an [[asynchronous circuit]], with bounded temporal uncertainty on gate transition events, as a [[finite-state machine]]. This paper was the earliest work on the verification of timing properties that modeled time both asynchronously and continuously, neither discretizing time nor imposing a global clock.{{r|dill}}

Some of Lewis' other heavily cited research papers extend beyond logic.
His paper "Symbolic evaluation and the global value graph" (1977, with his student [[John Reif]]) concerned [[data-flow analysis]] and [[symbolic execution]] in [[compiler]]s.{{ran|RL}}
And his paper "Symmetric space-bounded computation" (1982, with [[Christos Papadimitriou]]){{ran|LP82}}
was the first to define [[symmetric Turing machine]]s and symmetric [[space complexity]] classes such as [[SL (complexity)|SL]] (an [[undirected graph|undirected]] or [[reversible computing|reversible]] analogue of [[nondeterministic space]] complexity, later shown to coincide with deterministic [[logarithmic space]]).{{r|moore}}
In 1982, he chaired the program committee for the [[Symposium on Theory of Computing]],{{ran|STOC}} one of the two top research conferences in [[theoretical computer science]], considered broadly.{{r|fich}}

==Personal==
Lewis is a [[Visitor]] of [[Ralston College]] and a [[Trustee|Life Trustee]] of the [[Roxbury Latin School]].{{r|roxbury}} From 1995 to 2003 he was [[Trustee of the Charity of Edward Hopkins]].{{r|cv}}
''[[Washington Post]]'' journalist [[David Fahrenthold]] is his son-in-law;{{r|wedding}} while still a Harvard undergraduate, Fahrenthold wrote of his future father-in-law:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1855">[[File:homoeoid3d.jpg|thumb|Homoeoid in 3D]]
A '''homoeoid''' is a shell (a bounded region) bounded by two [[concentric]], [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] [[ellipse]]s (in 2D) or [[ellipsoid]]s (in 3D).&lt;ref&gt;[[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar|Chandrasekhar, S.]]: ''Ellipsoidal Figures of Equilibrium'', Yale Univ. Press. London (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Routh|Routh, E. J.]]: ''A Treatise on Analytical Statics, Vol II'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (1882)&lt;/ref&gt;
When the thickness of the shell becomes negligible, it is called a '''thin homoeoid'''. The name homoeoid was coined by [[Lord Kelvin]] and [[Peter Tait (physicist)|Peter Tait]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Bateman]]. "Partial differential equations of mathematical physics.", Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1932 (1932).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical definition==
If the outer shell is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}+\frac{z^2}{c^2}=1
&lt;/math&gt;
with semiaxes &lt;math&gt;a,b,c&lt;/math&gt; the inner shell is given for &lt;math&gt;0 \leq m \leq 1 &lt;/math&gt; by

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}+\frac{z^2}{c^2}=m^2
&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''thin homoeoid''' is then given by the limit
&lt;math&gt;
m \to 1
&lt;/math&gt;

==Physical meaning==
A homoeoid can be used as a construction element of a matter or charge distribution. The gravitational or electromagnetic [[potential]] of a homoeoid homogeneously filled with matter or charge is constant inside the shell. This means that a test mass or charge will not feel any force inside the shell.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Chasles]], [http://sites.mathdoc.fr/JMPA/PDF/JMPA_1840_1_5_A41_0.pdf ''Solution nouvelle du problème de l’attraction d’un ellipsoïde hétérogène sur un point exterieur''], Jour. Liouville 5, 465–488 (1840)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12408">In [[calculus]] and other branches of [[mathematical analysis]], limits involving an algebraic combination of functions in an independent variable may often be evaluated by replacing these functions by their [[limit (mathematics)|limits]]; if the expression obtained after this substitution does not give enough information to determine the original limit, it is said to take on an '''indeterminate form'''. The term was originally introduced by [[Cauchy]]'s student [[Moigno]] in the middle of the 19th century.

The indeterminate forms typically considered in the literature are denoted:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac 00,~ \frac{\infty}{\infty},~ 0\times\infty,~ 1^\infty,~ \infty-\infty,~ 0^0 \text{ and } \infty^0 .&lt;/math&gt;

== Discussion ==
The most common example of an indeterminate form occurs as the ratio of two functions, in which both of these functions tend to zero in the limit, and is referred to as "the indeterminate form 0/0". As ''x'' approaches 0, the ratios ''x''/''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''/''x'', and ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''x'' go to ∞, 1, and 0 respectively. In each case, if the limits of the numerator and denominator are substituted, the resulting expression is 0/0, which is undefined. So, in a manner of speaking, 0/0 can take on the values 0, 1, or ∞, and it is possible to construct similar examples for which the limit is any particular value.

More formally, when given that the [[function (mathematics)|functions]] ''f''(''x'') and ''g''(''x'') both approach 0 as ''x'' approaches some [[limit point]] ''c'' one does not have enough information to evaluate the [[limit of a function|limit]]

: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} .&lt;/math&gt;

Not every undefined algebraic expression corresponds to an indeterminate form. For example, the expression 1/0 is undefined as a [[real number]] but does not correspond to an indeterminate form, because any limit that gives rise to this form will [[divergence to infinity|diverge to infinity]].

An indeterminate form expression may have a value in some contexts.
For example, if ''κ'' is an infinite [[cardinal number]], then expressions 0&lt;sup&gt;''κ''&lt;/sup&gt;, 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, 1&lt;sup&gt;''κ''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''κ''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; are well defined in the context of [[Cardinal number#Cardinal arithmetic|cardinal arithmetic]]. See also [[Zero to the power of zero]]. Note that [[#Expressions that are not indeterminate forms|zero to the power infinity is not an indeterminate form]].

== Some examples and non-examples ==
=== Indeterminate form 0/0 ===
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Indeterminate form - x over x.gif|(1)
File:Indeterminate form - x2 over x.gif|(2)
File:Indeterminate form - sin x over x close.gif|(3)
File:Indeterminate form - complicated.gif|(4)
File:Indeterminate form - 2x over x.gif|(5)
File:Indeterminate form - x over x3.gif|(6)
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The indeterminate form 0/0 is particularly common in [[calculus]] because it often arises in the evaluation of [[derivative]]s using their limit definition.

As mentioned above,
: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x}{x} = 1, \qquad &lt;/math&gt; (see fig.1)
while
: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x^{2}}{x} = 0,  \qquad &lt;/math&gt; (see fig.2)
This is enough to show that 0/0 is an indeterminate form.
Other examples with this indeterminate form include
: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(x)}{x} = 1, \qquad &lt;/math&gt; (see fig.3)
and
: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 49} \frac{x - 49}{\sqrt{x}\, - 7} = 14, \qquad &lt;/math&gt; (see fig.4)
Direct substitution of the number that ''x'' approaches into any of these expressions shows that these are examples of the indeterminate form 0/0, but these limits take many different values. Any desired value ''a'' can be obtained for this indeterminate form as follows:
: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{ax}{x} = a . \qquad &lt;/math&gt; (see fig.5)
The value infinity can also be obtained (in the sense of divergence to infinity):
: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{x}{x^3} = \infty . \qquad &lt;/math&gt; (see fig.6)

===Indeterminate form 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; ===
{{main|Zero to the power of zero}}

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Indeterminate form - x0.gif|(7)
File:Indeterminate form - 0x.gif|(8)
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The following limits illustrate that the expression 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is an indeterminate form:

: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 0^+} x^0 = 1 , \qquad &lt;/math&gt; (see fig.7)

: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 0^+} 0^x = 0 . \qquad &lt;/math&gt; (see fig.8)

Thus, in general, knowing that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \;=\; 0\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\lim_{x \to c} g(x) \;=\; 0&lt;/math&gt; is not sufficient to calculate the limit

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} f(x)^{g(x)} .&lt;/math&gt;

If the functions ''f'' and ''g'' are [[Analytic function|analytic]] at ''c'', and ''f'' is positive for ''x'' sufficiently close (but not equal) to ''c'', then the limit of ''f''(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;''g''(''x'')&lt;/sup&gt; will be 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2689754 |author1=Louis M. Rotando |author2=Henry Korn |title=The indeterminate form 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; |journal=Mathematics Magazine |date=January 1977 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=41&amp;ndash;42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, use the transformation in the [[#List of indeterminate forms|table]] below to evaluate the limit.

=== Expressions that are not indeterminate forms ===

The expression 1/0 is not commonly regarded as an indeterminate form because there is not an infinite range of values that ''f''/''g'' could approach. Specifically, if ''f'' approaches 1 and ''g'' approaches 0, then ''f'' and ''g'' may be chosen so that (1) ''f''/''g'' approaches +∞, (2) ''f''/''g'' approaches −∞, or (3) the limit fails to exist. In each case the absolute value |''f''/''g''| approaches +∞, and so the quotient ''f''/''g'' must diverge, in the sense of the [[extended real number]]s. (In the framework of the [[projectively extended real line]], the limit is the [[Point at infinity|unsigned infinity]] ∞ in all three cases.) Similarly, any expression of the form ''a''/0, with {{nowrap|''a'' ≠ 0}} (including {{nowrap|1=''a'' = +∞}} and {{nowrap|1=''a'' = −∞}}), is not an indeterminate form since a quotient giving rise to such an expression will always diverge.

The expression 0&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; is not an indeterminate form. The expression 0&lt;sup&gt;+∞&lt;/sup&gt; has the limiting value 0 for the given individual limits, and the expression 0&lt;sup&gt;−∞&lt;/sup&gt; is equivalent to 1/0.

== Evaluating indeterminate forms ==

The adjective ''indeterminate'' does ''not'' imply that the limit does not exist, as many of the examples above show. In many cases, algebraic elimination, [[L'Hôpital's rule]], or other methods can be used to manipulate the expression so that the limit can be evaluated.

For example, the expression ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''x'' can be simplified to ''x'' at any point other than ''x'' = 0. Thus, the limit of this expression as ''x'' approaches 0 (which depends only on points ''near'' 0, not at ''x'' = 0 itself) is the limit of ''x'', which is 0. Most of the other examples above can also be evaluated using algebraic simplification.

===Equivalent infinitesimal===
When two variables &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; converge to zero at the same point and &lt;math&gt;\lim \frac{\beta}{\alpha} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, they are called ''equivalent infinitesimal''.

For the evaluation of the indeterminate form 0/0, we can use the following equivalent [[infinitesimal]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vaxasoftware.com/doc_eduen/mat/infiequi.pdf|title=Table of equivalent infinitesimals|last=|first=|date=|website=Vaxa Software|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x \sim \sin x,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x \sim \arcsin x,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x \sim \sinh x,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x \sim \tan x,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x \sim \arctan x,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x \sim \ln(1 + x),&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;1 - \cos x \sim \frac{x^2}{2},&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\cosh x - 1 \sim \frac{x^2}{2},&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;a^x - 1 \sim x \ln a,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e^x - 1\sim x,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(1 + x)^a - 1 \sim ax.&lt;/math&gt;

For example:
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{x^3} \left[\left(\frac{2+ \cos x}{3}\right)^x-1\right] = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{x\ln{\frac{2 + \cos x}{3}}} -1}{x^3} =  \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{x^2} \ln \frac{2+ \cos x}{3} = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{x^2} \ln \left(\frac{\cos x -1}{3}+1\right) = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\cos x -1}{3x^2} = -\frac{1}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
|}
Here is a brief proof:

Suppose there are two equivalent infinitesimals &lt;math&gt;\alpha \sim \alpha'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta \sim \beta'&lt;/math&gt;.
:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\lim \frac{\beta}{\alpha} = \lim \frac{\beta \beta' \alpha'}{\beta' \alpha' \alpha} = \lim \frac{\beta}{\beta'} \lim \frac{\alpha'}{\alpha} \lim \frac{\beta'}{\alpha'} = \lim \frac{\beta'}{\alpha'}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

===L'Hôpital's rule===
{{main|L'Hôpital's rule}}
L'Hôpital's rule is a general method for evaluating the indeterminate forms 0/0 and ∞/∞. This rule states that (under appropriate conditions)
: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} , \! &lt;/math&gt;
where ''f&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' and ''g&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' are the [[derivative (calculus)|derivative]]s of ''f'' and ''g''. (Note that this rule does ''not'' apply to expressions ∞/0, 1/0, and so on; these expressions are not indeterminate forms.) These derivatives will allow one to perform algebraic simplification and eventually evaluate the limit.

L'Hôpital's rule can also be applied to other indeterminate forms, using first an appropriate algebraic transformation. For example, to evaluate the form 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt; \ln \lim_{x \to c} f(x)^{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to c} \frac{\ln f(x)}{1/g(x)} . \! &lt;/math&gt;
The right-hand side is of the form ∞/∞, so L'Hôpital's rule applies to it. Note that this equation is valid (as long as the right-hand side is defined) because the [[natural logarithm]] (ln) is a [[continuous function]]; it is irrelevant how well-behaved ''f'' and ''g'' may (or may not) be as long as ''f'' is asymptotically positive.

Although L'Hôpital's rule applies both to 0/0 and to ∞/∞, one of these forms may be more useful than the other in a particular case (because of the possibility of algebraic simplification afterwards). One can change between these forms, if necessary, by transforming ''f''/''g'' to (1/''g'')/(1/''f'').

A. Goguen and R. M. Burstall, Institutions: Abstract Model Theory for Specification and Programming, Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery 39, pp. 95–146, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of institutions makes it possible to develop concepts of [[specification language]]s (like structuring of specifications, parameterization, implementation, refinement, development), [[proof calculi]] and even [[tool]]s in a way completely independent of the underlying logical system. There are also [[morphism]]s that allow to relate and translate logical systems. Important applications of this are re-use of logical structure (also called borrowing), heterogeneous specification and combination of logics. 

The spread of [[institutional model theory]] has generalized various notions and results of [[model theory]] and institutions themselves have impacted the progress of [[universal logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Razvan Diaconescu, "Three decades of institution theory" in Universal Logic: An Anthology edited by Jean-Yves Béziau 2012 Springer
{{ISBN|978-3-0346-0144-3}} pp 309-322&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;T. Mossakowski, J. A. Goguen, R. Diaconescu, A. Tarlecki, "What is a Logic?", '. In Jean-Yves Beziau (Ed.), [https://www.springer.com/birkhauser/mathematics/book/978-3-7643-8353-4 Logica Universalis: Towards a General Theory of Logic],  pp.&amp;nbsp;113–133. Birkhäuser, Basel, 2005, 2nd Edition 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The theory of institutions does not assume anything about the nature of the logical system. That is, [[Interpretation (logic)|model]]s and [[Sentence (mathematical logic)|sentences]] may be arbitrary objects; the only assumption is that there is a '''satisfaction relation''' between models and sentences, telling whether a sentence holds in a model or not. Satisfaction is inspired by [[T-schema|Tarski's truth definition]], but can in fact be any binary relation.
A crucial feature of institutions now is that models, sentences and their satisfaction are always being considered to live in some vocabulary or context  (called '''signature''') that defines the (non-logical) symbols that may be used in sentences and that need to be interpreted in models. Moreover, '''signature morphisms''' allow to extend signatures, change notation etc. Nothing is assumed about signatures and signature morphisms except that signature morphisms can be composed; this amounts to having a 
[[Category (mathematics)|category]] of signatures and morphisms. Finally, it is assumed that signature morphisms lead to translations of sentences and models in a way that satisfaction is preserved. While sentences are translated along with signature morphisms (think of symbols being replaced along the morphism), models are translated (or better: reduced) '''against''' signature morphisms: for example, in case of a signature extension, a model of the (larger) target signature may be reduced to a model of the (smaller) source signature by just forgetting some components of the model.

Formally, an institution consists of

* a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] &lt;math&gt;Sign&lt;/math&gt; of '''signatures''',
* a [[functor]] &lt;math&gt;sen:Sign \to &lt;/math&gt;[[Category of sets|Set]] giving, for each signature &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the set of '''sentences''' &lt;math&gt;sen(\Sigma)&lt;/math&gt;, and for each signature morphism &lt;math&gt;\sigma:\Sigma\to\Sigma'&lt;/math&gt;, the '''sentence translation map''' &lt;math&gt;sen(\sigma):sen(\Sigma)\to sen(\Sigma')&lt;/math&gt;, where often &lt;math&gt;sen(\sigma)(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math&gt;\sigma(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;,
* a [[functor]] &lt;math&gt;Mod:Sign^{op}\to&lt;/math&gt;[[Category of small categories|Cat]] giving, for each signature &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the category of '''models''' &lt;math&gt;Mod(\Sigma)&lt;/math&gt;, and for each signature morphism &lt;math&gt;\sigma:\Sigma\to\Sigma'&lt;/math&gt;, the '''reduct functor''' &lt;math&gt;Mod(\sigma):Mod(\Sigma')\to Mod(\Sigma)&lt;/math&gt;, where often &lt;math&gt;Mod(\sigma)(M')&lt;/math&gt; is written as &lt;math&gt;M'|_{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;,
* a satisfaction [[Binary relation|relation]] &lt;math&gt;{\models_{\Sigma}}\subseteq|{Mod(\Sigma)|\times sen(\Sigma)}&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\in Sign&lt;/math&gt;,

such that for each &lt;math&gt;\sigma:\Sigma\to\Sigma'&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Sign&lt;/math&gt; the following '''satisfaction condition'''  holds:

&lt;math&gt;M'\models_{\Sigma'}\sigma(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;M'|_{\sigma}
\models_{\Sigma} \varphi&lt;/math&gt;

for each &lt;math&gt;M'\in Mod(\Sigma')&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi\in sen(\Sigma)&lt;/math&gt;.

The satisfaction condition expresses that truth is invariant under change of notation 
(and also under enlargement or quotienting of context).

Strictly speaking, the model functor ends in the "category" of all large categories.

'''Jeffry Ned Kahn''' is a professor of mathematics at [[Rutgers University]] notable for his work in [[combinatorics]]. Kahn received his Ph.D from [[The Ohio State University]] in 1979 after completing his dissertation under his advisor [[Dijen K. Ray-Chaudhuri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy |id=9979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 he showed the importance of the [[bundle theorem]] for ovoidal [[Möbius plane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Inversive planes satisfying the bundle theorem'', Journal Combinatorial Theory, Serie A, Vol.29, 1980, p. 1-19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, together with [[Gil Kalai]], he disproved [[Borsuk's conjecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Jeff|last1=Kahn|first2=Gil|last2=Kalai|author2-link=Gil Kalai|arxiv=math.MG/9307229 |title=A counterexample to Borsuk's conjecture|journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=29|year=1993|pages=60–62|doi=10.1090/S0273-0979-1993-00398-7|mr=1193538}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 he was awarded the [[Pólya Prize (SIAM)]].

'''Sir John George Shaw-Lefevre''' [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] (24 January 1797 &amp;ndash; 20 August 1879) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] barrister, [[Whig (British political faction)|Whig]] politician and civil servant.

==Life==
Shaw-Lefevre was the son of [[Charles Shaw-Lefevre (MP)|Charles Shaw-Lefevre]] by his wife Helen, daughter of John Lefevre. [[Charles Shaw-Lefevre, 1st Viscount Eversley]], was his elder brother. He was educated at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he was [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Senior Wrangler]] in 1818, and was [[Call to the Bar|called to the Bar]], [[Inner Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=SHW811JG|name=Shaw-Lefevre, John George}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1820. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url = http://royalsociety.org/dserve/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=1&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27shaw-lefevre%27%29| title = Library and Archive catalogue|publisher = Royal Society|accessdate = 2012-08-03}} &lt;/ref&gt;

He was returned to Parliament for [[Petersfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Petersfield]] in December 1832, but was unseated on petition in March 1833. He served under [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Lord Grey]] as [[Under-Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]] in 1834. The latter year Shaw-Lefevre was appointed a [[Poor Law Commissioner]] after the passing of the [[Poor Law Amendment Act]], which he remained until 1841. Between 1856 and 1875 he served as [[Clerk of the Parliaments]]. He also helped found the [[University of London]] and served as its Vice-Chancellor for many years. He was made a [[Order of the Bath|KCB]] in 1857 for his public services.

Shaw-Lefevre married Rachel Emily, daughter of Ichabod Wright, in 1824. They had one surviving son, [[George Shaw-Lefevre, 1st Baron Eversley|George]], who became a prominent politician and was ennobled as Baron Eversley, and five daughters.  One daughter, [[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]], was the first Principal of [[Somerville Hall]]; another daughter, Rachel, married [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Arthur Hamilton-Gordon]], son of the Prime Minister the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|4th Earl of Aberdeen]].

Shaw-Lefevre died in August 1879, aged 82. His wife lived for six more years before dying in February 1885.

The [[Lefevre Peninsula]] in [[South Australia]], was named by [[Governor of South Australia|Governor]] [[John Hindmarsh]] on 3 June 1837 after Shaw-Lefevre, who was one of South Australia's Colonisation Commissioners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.placenames.sa.gov.au/ PlaceNames Online - South Australian State Gazetteer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517083043/http://www.placenames.sa.gov.au/ |date=17 May 2008 }} Site is a searchable database.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2970">In [[mathematics]], the '''Khintchine inequality''', named after [[Aleksandr Khinchin]] and spelled in multiple ways in the Roman alphabet, is a theorem from [[probability]], and is also frequently used in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Heuristically, it says that if we pick &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; [[complex numbers]] &lt;math&gt; x_1,\dots,x_N \in\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, and add them together each multiplied by a random sign &lt;math&gt;\pm 1 &lt;/math&gt;, then the [[expected value]] of the sum's [[absolute value|modulus]], or the modulus it will be closest to on average, will be not too far off from &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{|x_1|^{2}+\cdots + |x_N|^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Statement of theorem==

Let &lt;math&gt; \{\varepsilon_n\}_{n=1}^N &lt;/math&gt; be [[i.i.d.]] [[random variables]] 
with &lt;math&gt;P(\varepsilon_n=\pm1)=\frac12&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n=1,\ldots, N&lt;/math&gt;, 
i.e., a sequence with [[Rademacher distribution]]. Let &lt;math&gt; 0&lt;p&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt; x_1,\ldots,x_N\in \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt; A_p \left( \sum_{n=1}^N |x_n|^2 \right)^{1/2} \leq \left(\operatorname{E} \left|\sum_{n=1}^N \varepsilon_n x_n\right|^p \right)^{1/p}  \leq B_p \left(\sum_{n=1}^N |x_n|^2\right)^{1/2} &lt;/math&gt;

for some constants &lt;math&gt; A_p,B_p&gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; depending only on &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Expected value]] for notation). The sharp values of the constants &lt;math&gt;A_p,B_p&lt;/math&gt; were found by Haagerup (Ref. 2; see Ref. 3 for a simpler proof). It is a simple matter to see that &lt;math&gt;A_p = 1&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;p \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;B_p = 1&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; p \le 2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Uses in analysis==

The uses of this inequality are not limited to applications in [[probability theory]]. One example of its use in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] is the following: if we let &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; be a [[linear operator]] between two [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]] &lt;math&gt; L^p(X,\mu)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; L^p(Y,\nu) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1\leq p &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;, with bounded [[operator norm|norm]] &lt;math&gt; \|T\|&lt;\infty &lt;/math&gt;, then one can use Khintchine's inequality to show that

:&lt;math&gt; \left\|\left(\sum_{n=1}^N |Tf_n|^2 \right)^{1/2} \right\|_{L^p(Y,\nu)}\leq C_p \left\|\left(\sum_{n=1}^N |f_n|^2\right)^{1/2} \right\|_{L^p(X,\mu)} &lt;/math&gt;

for some constant &lt;math&gt;C_p&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; depending only on &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\|T\|&lt;/math&gt;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1066">In [[cryptanalysis]], a '''kiss''' is a pair of identical messages sent using different ciphers, one of which has been broken. The term was used at [[Bletchley Park]] during [[World War II]]. A deciphered message in the breakable system provided a "[[crib (cryptanalysis)|crib]]" (piece of known plaintext) which could then be used to read the unbroken messages. One example was where messages read in a German [[meteorology|meteorological]] cipher could be used to provide cribs for reading the difficult 4-wheel Naval [[Enigma Machine|Enigma]] cipher.

:''cribs from re-encipherments .... were known as 'kisses' in Bletchley Park parlance because the relevant signals were marked with  'xx' ''&lt;ref&gt;Smith &amp; Erskine (2001) p 69&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. '''Lawrence Jerome Fogel''' (March 2, 1928 – February 18, 2007) was a pioneer in [[evolutionary computation]] and human factors analysis. He is known as the inventor of [[active noise cancellation]] and the father of [[evolutionary programming]]. His scientific career spanned nearly six decades and included [[electrical engineering]], [[aerospace engineering]], [[communication theory]], human factors research, [[information processing]], [[cybernetics]], biotechnology, [[artificial intelligence]], and [[computer science]].

==Aerospace engineering and antenna design==

During 1948-1949, shortly after completing his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from [[New York University]], Lawrence Fogel worked at Watson Laboratories (USAF) computing radiation patterns for VHF and UHF radio direction finders for use in ground-to-air operations. He designed feedback amplifier filters to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for these radio systems. At [[Eglin Air Force Base]], he controlled the final flight test program for the Diversity Antenna Array. Between 1950 and 1953, Fogel worked for Coles Signal Laboratory (U.S. Army Signal Corps) as an engineer in charge of the installation of electronic communication and navigation equipment in Army aircraft and helicopters. He completed his master's degree in electrical engineering at this same time from [[Rutgers University]]. During his time with Stavid Engineering, Inc. (New Jersey) between 1953 and 1956, he directed field operations of the [[SSM-N-8 Regulus|Regulus Missile]] guidance system for submarines and also assisted with the design of flight instrumentation, communications, and electronics for aircraft and helicopters. As a part of this research, he formulated a solution for a mathematical model of the human operator as part of an aircraft flight control system that included such qualities as anticipation, development of a computer facility incorporating such a mode for use in the design of more effective human-machine relations. His efforts also led to five patents between 1958 and 1961 regarding [[active noise cancellation]] to reduce noise in helicopter cockpit environments for improved communication. These were the first patents in noise-cancelling headphone systems.

==Information theory and human factors research==

Fogel was also interested in [[information theory]] and communications, especially those associated with aircraft instrument displays. He published several articles intended to link communication theory and instrument design.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fogel |first=Lawrence J. |last2= |first2= |date=1955 |title=A Communication Theory Approach Toward the Design of Aircraft Instrument Displays |url= |journal=Aeronautical and Navigational Electronics |publisher= |volume=March |issue= |pages=1–30 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fogel |first=Lawrence J. |last2= |first2= |date=1955 |title=A Note on a Measure for Meaning |url= |journal=Proceedings of the IRE |publisher= |volume=43 |issue=8 |pages=1018 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These investigations led to other strategies to help with air traffic control, as this was similar to the information transfer of knowledge to humans that was experienced in the cockpit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fogel |first=Lawrence J. |last2=Cafarelli |first2=N.J. |date=1955 |title=Analytic Approach to the General Air Traffic Control Problem |url= |journal=Aeronautical Electronics Digest |publisher=IRE |volume=May |issue= |pages=396 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Dynamics - Convair==

In 1956, Fogel moved to [[San Diego, California]] to work for [[Convair]], a division of [[General Dynamics|General Dynamics Corporation]]. He worked as head of the Reliability Group with the responsibility for maintaining and improving the overall reliability of systems such as the [[Convair F-102 Delta Dagger|F-102 Delta Dagger]], [[Convair F-106 Delta Dart|F-106 Delta Dart]], [[Convair 880]] transport, and other missile and electronics products. He was responsible for human engineering systems design and analysis for manned aircraft. Fogel initiated a program of investigation into the use of anticipatory displays that allow the pilot to "fly ahead" of the aircraft system being controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fogel |first=Lawrence J. |last2= |first2= |date=1957 |title=The Human Computer in Flight Control |url= |journal=IRE Transactions on Electronic Computers |publisher= |volume=EC-6 |issue=3 |pages=197–202 |doi= 10.1109/tec.1957.5222022|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fogel |first=Lawrence J. |last2= |first2= |date=1958 |title=Naturalness and Selectivity are Keys to Better Cockpit Display |url= |journal=Aviation Age Magazine |publisher= |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=32–37 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He invented and patented a new display called the "Kinelog," which for the first time offered the pilot inter-sensory compatibility as a protection against the onset of vertigo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fogel |first=Lawrence J. |last2= |first2= |date=1959 |title=A New Concept: The Kinalog System |url= |journal=Journal of the Human Factors Society |publisher= |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=30–37 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fogel |first=Lawrence J. |last2= |first2= |date=1959 |title=New Instrumentation Concepts for Manned Flight |url= |journal=Proceedings of the IRE |publisher= |volume=47 |issue=11 |pages=1978–1992 |doi= 10.1109/jrproc.1959.287214|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Science Foundation==

On leave from Convair, Lawrence Fogel served as Special Assistant to the Associate Director (Research) at the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) from July 1960 to July 1961. While at the NSF, Fogel represented the Associate Director at technical and professional meetings related to the merit of individual research proposals or to the effect of national policies on future manpower and economic and military strength. He devised mathematical models for the projection of the economic value of science funding. These projections were coordinated with many agencies including the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]], and the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]]. This effort culminated in a report to the U.S. Congress on the worth of investing in scientific progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bolt |first=Richard H. |last2=Fogel |first2=Lawrence J. |date=1961 |title=Investing in Scientific Progress |url= |journal= |publisher=National Science Foundation |volume=NSF Report No. 61-27 |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at NSF, Fogel's interest in [[cybernetics]], [[biotechnology]], and consciousness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fogel |first=Lawrence J. |date=1962 |title=Levels of Intelligence in Decision Making |url= |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |publisher= |volume=89 |issue=5 |pages=732–751 |doi= 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1961.tb20175.x|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to a hypothesis that a simulation of evolution on computers could be used to generate [[artificial intelligence]] without the need for [[expert system]]s. These theories were first tested successfully upon his return to Convair in 1961.

In 1960, Fogel served as a member of the founding editorial board for the journal ''IRE Transactions on Human Factors in Electronics.'' He remained as a part of that editorial board as that journal transitioned to the IEEE and became ''IEEE Transactions on Man-Machine Systems,'' a predecessor to ''IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Piuri |first=Vincenzo |last2= |first2= |date=2008 |title=In Memoriam-Dr. Lawrence J. Fogel |url= |journal=IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine |publisher= |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=68–69 |doi= 10.1109/mci.2007.913359|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Dynamics - astronautics==

While at Convair during 1961-1965, Fogel explored [[evolutionary programming]] for time-series prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fogel |first=Lawrence J. |date=1962 |title=Autonomous Automata |url= |journal=Industrial Research |publisher= |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=14–19 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fogel |first=Lawrence J. |last2= |first2= |date=1959 |title=New Instrumentation Concepts for Manned Flight |url= |journal=Proceedings of the IRE |publisher= |volume=47 |issue=11 |pages=1978–1992 |doi= 10.1109/jrproc.1959.287214|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fogel |first=Lawrence J. |last2=|first2= |last3= |first3= |date=1962 |title=Toward Inductive Inference Automata |url= |journal= |publisher=International Federation for Information Processing |volume=August |issue=Proceedings of the Congress, Munich |pages= |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These experiments validated the merit of the approach and this became the basis of Fogel's Ph.D. dissertation "On the Organization of Intellect" at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] where he received the Ph.D. in 1964 in biotechnology with minors in mathematics and communication theory. His was the first dissertation in the field of [[evolutionary computation]]. The dissertation became the basis of several papers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fogel |first=Lawrence J. |last2=Owens |first2=Alvin J. |last3=Walsh |first3=Michael J. |date=1964 |title=On the Evolution of Artificial Intelligence |url= |journal=Proceedings of the Fifth National Symposium on Human Factors in Electronics, San Diego, CA May 5–6 |publisher=IEEE |volume= |issue= |pages=63–76 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fogel |first=Lawrence J. |last2=Owens |first2=Alvin J. |last3=Walsh |first3=Michael J. |date=1964 |title=An Evolutionary Prediction Technique |url= |journal=IEEE International Symposium on Microwaves, Circuit Theory, and Information Theory, September |publisher=IEEE |volume= |issue= |pages=173–174 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the first book in the field of [[evolutionary computation]] ''Artificial Intelligence Through Simulated Evolution'' co-authored with Alvin Owens and Michael Walsh, also from Convair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fogel |first=Lawrence J. |last2=Owens |first2=Alvin J. |last3=Walsh |first3=Michael J. |title=Artificial Intelligence Through Simulated Evolution |year=1966 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QMLaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Artificial+intelligence+through+simulated+evolution&amp;dq=Artificial+intelligence+through+simulated+evolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MrAgVf3SJ4urogTg4YC4DA&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fogel continued to publish on these concepts in the scientific literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fogel |first=Lawrence J. |last2=Owens |first2=Alvin J. |last3=Walsh |first3=Michael J. |date=1966 |title=Intelligent Decision Making Through a Simulation of Evolution |url= |journal=Behavioral Science |publisher= |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=253–272 |doi= 10.1002/bs.3830110403|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Atmar |first=Wirt |last2= |first2= |date=2008 |title=In Memoriam-Reflections on Larry Fogel's Contributions to Computational Intelligence |url= |journal=IEEE Computational Intelligence Society |publisher= |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=76–77 |doi= 10.1109/mci.2007.913365|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his role as Senior Staff Scientist in Astronautics for General Dynamics, he provided improved the reliability of complex missile systems and information processing systems. Fogel devised the COFEC Reliability Data System for the [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas]] rocket. The Atlas was built at Convair in San Diego as America's first [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]. The Atlas D was used for [[Project Mercury]] to launch astronauts into low-Earth orbit in the 1960s. He also focused on how humans sense and process information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fogel |first=Lawrence J. |title=Human Information Processing |year=1963 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Human_information_processing.html?id=fHBRAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fogel also became associated with the burgeoning field of [[cybernetics]] and served as the third president of the [[American Society for Cybernetics]] in 1969, following [[Warren Sturgis McCulloch|Warren McCulloch]]. He also served as the founding editor-in-chief for the [[Cybernetics and Systems|''Journal of Cybernetics'']] and helped organize the second and third annual symposia of the American Society for Cybernetics (1964, 1965).

==Evolutionary programming==

In 1965, Fogel left General Dynamics to form a new company, Decision Science, Inc. in San Diego, specifically for applications of evolutionary programming. He served as President and directed research and real-world applications in the areas of information science, computer simulation, prediction, and systems control. Decision Science, Inc. was the first company specifically applying [[evolutionary computation]] to solve real-world problems. The methods were further developed through the efforts of Alvin Owens and George Burgin and formed the basis of a new generation of flight simulator first deployed at [[Langley Research Center]] for the purpose of air-to-air combat training. This approach was called the Adaptive Maneuvering Logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fogel |first=Lawrence J. |last2=Burgin |first2=George |date=1972 |title=Air-to-Air Combat Tactics Synthesis and Analysis Program Based on an Adaptive Maneuvering Logic  |url= |journal=Journal of Cybernetics |publisher= |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=60–68 |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burgin |first=George |last2=Owens |first2=Alvin J. |title=An Adaptive Maneuvering Logic Computer Program for the Simulation of One-to-One Air-to-Air Combat, Vol. II, NASA Report CR-2853 |year=1975 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19750024717.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burgin |first=George |last2= |first2= |date=2008 |title=In Memoriam-Reflections on Larry Fogel at Decision Science, Inc.

In 1982, Decision Science, Inc. was acquired by the Titan Corporation, a defense contractor in San Diego. Fogel continued working as a Vice President at Titan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ray |first=Gene |last2= |first2= |date=2008 |title=In Memoriam-Reflections on Larry Fogel at The Titan Corporation (1982-1988) |url= |journal=IEEE Computational Intelligence Society |publisher= |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=72–73 |doi= 10.1109/mci.2007.913362|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in 1988 as a Vice President of [[Lockheed Martin Orincon|ORINCON Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rickard |first=Terry |last2= |first2= |date=2008 |title=In Memoriam-Reflections on Larry Fogel at ORINCON Corporation (1988-1993) |url= |journal=IEEE Computational Intelligence Society |publisher= |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=73–74 |doi= 10.1109/mci.2007.913363|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, he was a co-founder in the formation of a new company, Natural Selection, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Porto |first=Bill |last2= |first2= |date=2008 |title=In Memoriam-Reflections on Larry Fogel at Natural Selection, Inc.

Lawrence Fogel was the President of Natural Selection, Inc. until his death in 2007.

==Personal life==

Fogel was also well known for his interest in radio-controlled sailboats and sailplanes. He was a passionate enthusiast and preservation advocate for the [[Torrey Pines Gliderport]] in San Diego. In the 1970s, he wrote a monthly column on RC soaring for ''Model Builder'' magazine. He was twice president of the Torrey Pines Gulls R/C Soaring Club, co-founded the Torrey Pines Scale Soaring Society, and was president of the National Soaring Society from 1975 to 1977. He was recognized with the highest membership grade of Fellow by the [[Academy of Model Aeronautics]] in 1996.

Fogel also enjoyed music and was proficient on piano, flute, saxophone, clarinet, and other instruments. He often enjoyed playing jazz at the Catamaran Hotel and other locations in San Diego and Washington, D.C.

There are many alternatives to the [[Calculus|classical calculus]] of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]; for example, each of the infinitely many [[Multiplicative calculus#History|non-Newtonian calculi]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Grossman and R. Katz, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RLuJmE5y8pYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false, ''Non-Newtonian Calculus''], {{isbn|0-912938-01-3}}, Lee Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally an alternative calculus is more suited than the classical calculus for expressing a given scientific or mathematical idea.&lt;ref&gt;Agamirza E.

The table below is intended to assist people working with the alternative calculus called the [[Multiplicative calculus|"geometric calculus"]] (or its discrete analog). Interested readers are encouraged to improve the table by inserting citations for verification, and by inserting more functions and more calculi.

== Table==

In the following table &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)=\frac{\Gamma'(x)}{\Gamma(x)}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[digamma function]], &lt;math&gt;K(x)=e^{\zeta^\prime(-1,x)-\zeta^\prime(-1)}=e^{\frac{z-z^2}{2}+\frac z2 \ln (2\pi)-\psi^{(-2)}(z)}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[K-function]], &lt;math&gt;(!x)=\frac{\Gamma(x+1,-1)}{e}&lt;/math&gt; is [[subfactorial]], &lt;math&gt;B_a(x)=-a\zeta(-a+1,x)&lt;/math&gt; are the generalized to real numbers [[Bernoulli polynomials]].

Lobb numbers form a natural generalization of the [[Catalan number]]s, which count the number of complete strings of balanced parentheses of a given length. Thus, the ''n''th Catalan number equals the Lobb number ''L''&lt;sub&gt;0,''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Lobb numbers are parameterized by two non-negative [[integers]] ''m'' and ''n'' with ''n''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0.  The (''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'')&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Lobb number ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is given in terms of [[binomial coefficient]]s by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;L_{m,n} = \frac{2m+1}{m+n+1}\binom{2n}{m+n} \qquad\text{ for }n \ge m \ge 0.&lt;/math&gt;

As well as counting sequences of parentheses, the Lobb numbers also count the number of ways in which ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''m'' copies of the value +1 and ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'' copies of the value −1 may be arranged into a sequence such that all of the [[partial sum]]s of the sequence are non-negative.

The '''method of exhaustion''' ({{lang|la|methodus exhaustionibus}}, or {{lang|fr|méthode des anciens}}) is a method of  finding the [[area]] of a [[shape]] by [[Inscribed figure|inscribing]] inside it a sequence of [[polygon]]s whose [[area]]s [[limit (mathematics)|converge]] to the area of the containing [[shape]]. If the sequence is correctly constructed, the difference in area between the ''n''-th polygon and the containing shape will become arbitrarily small as ''n'' becomes large. As this difference becomes arbitrarily small, the possible values for the area of the shape are systematically "exhausted" by the lower bound areas successively established by the sequence members.

The method of exhaustion typically required a form of [[proof by contradiction]], known as ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''.  This amounts to finding an area of a region by first comparing it to the area of a second region (which can be “exhausted” so that its area becomes arbitrarily close to the true area). The proof involves assuming that the true area is greater than the second area, and then proving that assertion false, and then assuming that it is less than the second area, and proving that assertion false, too.

== History ==
[[File:Grégoire de Saint-Vincent (1584-1667).jpg|thumb|150px|right|Gregory of Saint Vincent]]
The idea originated in the late 5th century BC with [[Antiphon (person)|Antiphon]], although it is not entirely clear how well he understood it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Antiphon.html The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was made rigorous a few decades later by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], who used it to calculate areas and volumes. It was later reinvented in [[Chinese mathematics|China]] by [[Liu Hui]] in the 3rd century AD in order to find the area of a circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|series=Chinese studies in the history and philosophy of science and technology|volume=130|title=A comparison of Archimedes' and Liu Hui's studies of circles|first1=Liu|last1=Dun|first2=Dainian|last2=Fan|first3=Robert Sonné|last3=Cohen|publisher=Springer|year=1966|isbn=0-7923-3463-9|page=279|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jaQH6_8Ju-MC}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jaQH6_8Ju-MC&amp;pg=PA279 Chapter , p. 279]&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of the term was in 1647 by [[Grégoire de Saint-Vincent|Gregory of Saint Vincent]] in ''Opus geometricum quadraturae circuli et sectionum''.

The method of exhaustion is seen as a precursor to the methods of [[calculus]]. The development of [[analytical geometry]] and rigorous [[integral calculus]] in the 17th-19th centuries subsumed the method of exhaustion so that it is no longer explicitly used to solve problems. An important alternative approach was [[Cavalieri's principle]], also termed the "[[method of indivisibles]]", which eventually evolved into the [[infinitesimal]] calculus of Roberval, Torricelli, Wallis, Leibniz, and others.

=== Euclid ===
[[Euclid]] used the method of exhaustion to prove the following six propositions in the book 12 of his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''.
; Proposition 2
: The area of circles is proportional to the square of their diameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookXII/propXII2.html|title=Euclid's Elements, Book XII, Proposition 2|website=aleph0.clarku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Proposition 5
: The volumes of two tetrahedra of the same height are proportional to the areas of their triangular bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookXII/propXII5.html|title=Euclid's Elements, Book XII, Proposition 5|website=aleph0.clarku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Proposition 10
: The volume of a cone is a third of the volume of the corresponding cylinder which has the same base and height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookXII/propXII10.html|title=Euclid's Elements, Book XII, Proposition 10|website=aleph0.clarku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Proposition 11
: The volume of a cone (or cylinder) of the same height is proportional to the area of the base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookXII/propXII11.html|title=Euclid's Elements, Book XII, Proposition 11|website=aleph0.clarku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Proposition 12
: The volume of a cone (or cylinder) that is similar to another is proportional to the cube of the ratio of the diameters of the bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookXII/propXII12.html|title=Euclid's Elements, Book XII, Proposition 12|website=aleph0.clarku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Proposition 18
: The volume of a sphere is proportional to the cube of its diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookXII/propXII18.html|title=Euclid's Elements, Book XII, Proposition 18|website=aleph0.clarku.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archimedes ===
{{Main|Pi}}
[[File:Archimedes pi.svg|thumb|right|300px|Archimedes used the method of exhaustion to compute the area inside a circle]]

[[Archimedes]] used the method of exhaustion as a way to compute the area inside a circle by filling the [[circle]] with a [[polygon]] of a greater area and greater number of [[Edge (geometry)|sides]].  The quotient formed by the area of this polygon divided by the square of the circle radius can be made arbitrarily close to  π as the number of polygon sides becomes large, proving that the area inside the circle of radius r is πr&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,  [[π]] being defined as the ratio of the circumference to the diameter (C/d) or of the area of the circle to the square of its radius (A/r²).

He also provided the bounds 3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;''/''&lt;sub&gt;71&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''π''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;''/''&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;, (giving a range of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''/''&lt;sub&gt;497&lt;/sub&gt;) by comparing the perimeters of the circle with the perimeters of the inscribed and circumscribed 96-sided regular polygons.

Other results he obtained with the method of exhaustion included&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* The area bounded by the intersection of a line and a parabola is 4/3 that of the triangle having the same base and height;
* The area of an ellipse is proportional to a rectangle having sides equal to its major and minor axes;
* The volume of a sphere is 4 times that of a cone having a base of the same radius and height equal to this radius;
* The volume of a cylinder having a height equal to its diameter is 3/2 that of a sphere having the same diameter;
* The area bounded by one spiral rotation and a line is 1/3 that of the circle having a radius equal to the line segment length;
* Use of the method of exhaustion also led to the successful evaluation of an infinite geometric series (for the first time).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20309">'''Operad theory''' is a field of [[mathematics]] concerned with prototypical [[algebra over a field|algebras]] that model properties such as [[commutativity]] or [[anticommutativity]] as well as various amounts of [[associativity]]. Operads generalize the various [[associativity]] properties already observed in [[Algebra over a field|algebras]] and [[coalgebra]]s such as [[Lie algebra]]s or [[Poisson algebra]]s by modeling computational trees within the algebra. Algebras are to operads as [[group representation]]s are to [[group (mathematics)|group]]s. An operad can be seen as a set of [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]], each one having a fixed finite number of inputs (arguments) and one output, which can be composed one with others. They form a [[Category theory|category-theoretic]] analog of [[universal algebra]].

Operads originate in [[algebraic topology]] from the study of iterated [[loop space]]s by [[Michael Boardman|J. Michael Boardman]] and [[Rainer M.

==Definition==

===Non-symmetric operad===
A '''non-symmetric operad''' (sometimes called an '''operad without permutations''', or a '''non-&lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;''' or '''plain''' operad) consists of the following:
* a sequence &lt;math&gt;(P(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; of sets, whose elements are called ''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-ary operations'',
* an element &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;P(1)&lt;/math&gt; called the ''identity'',
* for all positive integers &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k_1,\ldots,k_n&lt;/math&gt;, a ''composition'' function

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\circ: P(n)\times P(k_1)\times\cdots\times P(k_n) &amp; \to P(k_1+\cdots+k_n)\\
(\theta,\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n) &amp; \mapsto \theta\circ(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n),
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
satisfying the following coherence axioms:
* ''identity'': &lt;math&gt;\theta\circ(1,\ldots,1)=\theta=1\circ\theta&lt;/math&gt;
* ''associativity'':
:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; \theta \circ (\theta_1 \circ (\theta_{1,1}, \ldots, \theta_{1,k_1}), \ldots, \theta_n \circ (\theta_{n,1}, \ldots,\theta_{n,k_n})) \\
= {} &amp; (\theta \circ (\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_n)) \circ (\theta_{1,1}, \ldots, \theta_{1,k_1}, \ldots, \theta_{n,1}, \ldots, \theta_{n,k_n})
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

(the number of arguments corresponds to the arities of the operations).

Alternatively, a plain operad is a [[multicategory (category theory)|multicategory]] with one object.

===Symmetric operad===
A '''symmetric operad''' (often just called '''operad''') is a non-symmetric operad &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; as above, together with a right action of the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_n&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt;, satisfying the above associative and identity axioms, as well as

*''equivariance'': given permutations &lt;math&gt;s_i \in \Sigma_{k_i}, t\in \Sigma_n&lt;/math&gt;,
:: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp; (\theta*t)\circ(\theta_{t_1},\ldots,\theta_{t_n}) = (\theta\circ(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n))*t; \\[2pt]
&amp; \theta\circ(\theta_1*s_1,\ldots,\theta_n*s_n) = (\theta\circ(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n))*(s_1,\ldots,s_n)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
(where by [[abuse of notation]], &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; on the right hand side of the first equivariance relation is the element
of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{k_1+\dots+k_n}&lt;/math&gt; that acts on the set &lt;math&gt;\{1, 2, \dots , k_1+\dots +k_n\}&lt;/math&gt; by breaking it into &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; blocks, the first of size &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt;, the second of size &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;, through the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th block of size &lt;math&gt;k_n&lt;/math&gt;, and then permutes these &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; blocks by &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;).

The permutation actions in this definition are vital to most applications, including the original application to loop spaces.

=== Morphisms ===
A '''morphism of operads''' &lt;math&gt;f:P\to Q&lt;/math&gt; consists of a sequence
:&lt;math&gt;(f_n:P(n)\to Q(n))_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt;
which:
* preserves the identity: &lt;math&gt;f(1)=1&lt;/math&gt;
* preserves composition: for every ''n''-ary operation &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and operations &lt;math&gt;\theta_1 , \ldots , \theta_n&lt;/math&gt;,
:: &lt;math&gt;
f(\theta\circ(\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_n))
= f(\theta)\circ(f(\theta_1),\ldots,f(\theta_n))
&lt;/math&gt;
* preserves the permutation actions: &lt;math&gt;f(x*s)=f(x)*s&lt;/math&gt;.

=== In other categories ===
We have so far considered only operads in the [[Category theory|category]] of sets. It is actually possible to define operads in any [[symmetric monoidal category]] (or, for non-symmetric operads, any [[monoidal category]]).

A common example would be given by the category of [[topological space]], with the monoidal product given by the [[Cartesian product]]. In this case, a topological operad is given by a sequence of ''spaces'' (instead of sets) &lt;math&gt;\{ P(n) \}_{n \ge 0}&lt;/math&gt;. The structure maps of the operad (the composition and the actions of the symmetric groups) must then be assumed to be continuous. The result is called a ''topological operad''. Similarly, in the definition of a morphism, it would be necessary to assume that the maps involved are continuous.

Other common settings to define operads include, for example, [[Module (mathematics)|module]] over a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], [[chain complex]]es, [[groupoid]]s (or even the category of categories itself), [[coalgebra]]s, etc.

== Understanding the axioms ==

===Associativity axiom===
"Associativity" means that ''composition'' of operations is associative
(the function &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; is associative), analogous to the axiom in category theory that &lt;math&gt;f \circ (g \circ h) = (f \circ g) \circ h&lt;/math&gt;; it does ''not'' mean that the operations ''themselves'' are associative as operations.
Compare with the [[#Associative_operad|associative operad]], below.

Associativity in operad theory means that one can write [[Expression (mathematics)|expressions]] involving operations without ambiguity from the omitted compositions, just as associativity for operations allows one to write products without ambiguity from the omitted parentheses.

For instance, suppose that &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is a binary operation, which is written as &lt;math&gt;\theta(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(ab)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; may or may not be associative.

Then what is commonly written &lt;math&gt;((ab)c)&lt;/math&gt; is unambiguously written operadically as &lt;math&gt;\theta \circ (\theta,1)&lt;/math&gt; . This sends &lt;math&gt;(a,b,c)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(ab,c)&lt;/math&gt; (apply &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; on the first two, and the identity on the third), and then the &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; on the left "multiplies" &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.
This is clearer when depicted as a tree:

[[File:OperadTreeCompose1.svg|Tree before composition]]

which yields a 3-ary operation:

[[File:OperadTreeCompose2.svg|Tree after composition]]
{{Clear}}

However, the expression &lt;math&gt;(((ab)c)d)&lt;/math&gt; is ''a priori'' ambiguous:
it could mean &lt;math&gt;\theta \circ ((\theta,1) \circ ((\theta,1),1))&lt;/math&gt;, if the inner compositions are performed first, or it could mean &lt;math&gt;(\theta \circ (\theta,1)) \circ ((\theta,1),1)&lt;/math&gt;,
if the outer compositions are performed first (operations are read from right to left).
Writing &lt;math&gt;x=\theta, y=(\theta,1), z=((\theta,1),1)&lt;/math&gt;, this is &lt;math&gt;x \circ (y \circ z)&lt;/math&gt; versus &lt;math&gt;(x \circ y) \circ z&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the tree is missing "vertical parentheses":

[[File:OperadTreeCompose3.svg|Tree before composition]]

If the top two rows of operations are composed first (puts an upward parenthesis at the &lt;math&gt;(ab)c\ \ d&lt;/math&gt; line; does the inner composition first), the following results:

[[File:OperadTreeCompose4.svg|Intermediate tree]]

which then evaluates unambiguously to yield a 4-ary operation.
As an annotated expression:
:&lt;math&gt;\theta_{(ab)c\cdot d} \circ ((\theta_{ab \cdot c},1_d) \circ ((\theta_{a\cdot b},1_c),1_d))&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:OperadTreeCompose5.svg|Tree after composition]]

If the bottom two rows of operations are composed first (puts a downward parenthesis at the &lt;math&gt;ab\quad c\ \ d&lt;/math&gt; line; does the outer composition first), following results:

[[File:OperadTreeCompose6.svg|Intermediate tree]]

which then evaluates unambiguously to yield a 4-ary operation:

[[File:OperadTreeCompose5.svg|Tree after composition]]

The operad axiom of associativity is that ''these yield the same result,'' and thus that the expression &lt;math&gt;(((ab)c)d)&lt;/math&gt; is unambiguous.

===Identity axiom===
The identity axiom (for a binary operation) can be visualized in a tree as:

[[Image:OperadIdentityAxiom.svg|The axiom of identity in an operad]]

meaning that the three operations obtained are equal: pre- or post- composing with the identity makes no difference. Note that, as for categories, &lt;math&gt;1 \circ 1 = 1&lt;/math&gt; is a corollary of the identity axiom.

==="Little something" operads===
A '''little discs operad''' or, '''little balls operad''' or, more specifically, the '''little ''n''-discs operad''' is a topological operad defined in terms of configurations of disjoint ''n''-dimensional [[disc (mathematics)|disc]]s inside a unit ''n''-disc centered in the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] of  '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. The operadic composition for little 2-discs is illustrated in the figure.&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Giachetta, Luigi Mangiarotti, [[Sardanashvily|Gennadi Sardanashvily]] (2005) ''Geometric and Algebraic Topological Methods in Quantum Mechanics,'' {{isbn|981-256-129-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fLbisfrkWpoC&amp;pg=PA474&amp;lpg=PA474&amp;dq=%22Little+discs+operad%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=NNKTqHPeX7&amp;sig=KVdeG4dbMj1GfggbYd3zeNVs_zQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA474,M1 pp. 474,475]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally the '''little ''n''-cubes operad''' or the '''little intervals operad''' (initially called little ''n''-cubes [[PRO (category theory)|PROP]]s) was defined by [[Michael Boardman]] and [[Rainer Vogt]]  in a similar way, in terms of configurations of disjoint [[axis-aligned]] ''n''-dimensional [[hypercube]]s (n-dimensional [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]]) inside the [[unit hypercube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Axiomatic, Enriched and Motivic Homotopy Theory|last=Greenlees|first=J.

===Associative operad===
Another class of examples of operads are those capturing the structures of algebraic structures, such as associative algebras, commutative algebras and Lie algebras. Each of these can be exhibited as a finitely presented operad, in each of these three generated by binary operations.

Thus, the associative operad is generated by a binary operation &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, subject to the condition that
:&lt;math&gt;\psi\circ(\psi,1)=\psi\circ(1,\psi).&lt;/math&gt;

This condition ''does'' correspond to [[associativity]] of the binary operation &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;; writing &lt;math&gt;\psi(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; multiplicatively, the above condition is &lt;math&gt;(ab)c = a(bc)&lt;/math&gt;. This associativity of the ''operation'' should not be confused with associativity of ''composition''; see the [[#Axiom_of_associativity|axiom of associativity]], above.

This operad is [[terminal object|terminal]] in the category of non-symmetric operads, as it has exactly one ''n''-ary operation for each ''n,'' corresponding to the unambiguous product of ''n'' terms: &lt;math&gt;x_1 \dotsb x_n&lt;/math&gt;. For this reason, it is sometimes written as 1 by category theorists (by analogy with the one-point set, which is terminal in the category of sets).

===Terminal symmetric operad===
The terminal symmetric operad is the operad whose algebras are commutative monoids, which also has one ''n''-ary operation for each ''n'', with each &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; acting trivially; this triviality corresponds to commutativity, and whose ''n''-ary operation is the unambiguous product of ''n''-terms, where order does not matter:
:&lt;math&gt;x_1 \dotsb x_n = x_{\sigma(1)} \dotsb x_{\sigma(n)}&lt;/math&gt;
for any permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma \in S_n&lt;/math&gt;.

===Operads from the symmetric and braid groups===
There is an operad for which each &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;. The composite &lt;math&gt;\sigma \circ (\tau_1, \dots, \tau_n)&lt;/math&gt; permutes its inputs in blocks according to &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and within blocks according to the appropriate &lt;math&gt;\tau_i&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, there is a non-&lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; operad for which each &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is given by the Artin [[braid group]] &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, this non-&lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; operad has the structure of a braided operad, which generalizes the notion of an operad from symmetric to braid groups.

===Linear algebra===
In [[linear algebra]], one can consider vector spaces to be algebras over the operad &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; (the infinite [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]], so only finitely many terms are non-zero; this corresponds to only taking finite sums), which parametrizes [[linear combinations]]: the vector &lt;math&gt;(2,3,-5,0,\dots)&lt;/math&gt; for instance corresponds to the linear combination
:&lt;math&gt;2v_1 + 3v_2 -5v_3 + 0v_4 + \cdots.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, one can consider [[affine combination]]s, [[conical combination]]s, and [[convex combination]]s to correspond to the sub-operads where the terms sum to 1, the terms are all non-negative, or both, respectively. Graphically, these are the infinite affine hyperplane, the infinite hyper-octant, and the infinite simplex. This formalizes what is meant by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; being or the standard simplex being model spaces, and such observations as that every bounded [[convex polytope]] is the image of a simplex. Here suboperads correspond to more restricted operations and thus more general theories.

This point of view formalizes the notion that linear combinations are the most general sort of operation on a vector space – saying that a vector space is an algebra over the operad of linear combinations is precisely the statement that ''all possible'' algebraic operations in a vector space are linear combinations. The basic operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication are a [[generating set]] for the operad of all linear combinations, while the linear combinations operad canonically encodes all possible operations on a vector space.

'''PRESENT''' is a lightweight [[block cipher]], developed by the [[Orange Labs]] (France), [[Ruhr University Bochum]] (Germany) and the [[Technical University of Denmark]] in 2007. PRESENT is designed by Andrey Bogdanov, Lars R. Knudsen, Gregor Leander, Christof Paar, Axel Poschmann, Matthew J. B. Robshaw, Yannick Seurin, and  C. Vikkelsoe.&lt;ref name=paper&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bogdanov|first1=Andrey|last2=Knudsen|first2=Lars R.|last3=Leander|first3=Gregor|last4=Paar|first4=Christof|last5=Poschmann|first5=Axel|last6=Robshaw|first6=Matthew J.

==Overview==

The block size is 64 bits and the key size can be 80 bit or 128 bit. The non-linear layer is based on a single 4-bit S-box which was designed with hardware optimizations in mind. ''PRESENT'' is intended to be used in situations where low-power consumption and high chip efficiency is desired. The [[International Organization for Standardization]] and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] included PRESENT in the new international standard for lightweight cryptographic methods.&lt;ref name="KUL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=56552 |title=ISO/IEC 29192-2:2012 |author=ISO |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cryptanalysis==
A truncated [[Differential cryptanalysis|differential attack]] on 26 out of 31 rounds of ''PRESENT'' was suggested in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blondeau|first1=Cline|last2=Nyberg|first2=Kaisa|title=Links between truncated differential and multidimensional linear properties of block ciphers and underlying attack complexities|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|date=2014|volume=8441|issue=Advances in Cryptology EUROCRYPT 2014|pages=165–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several full-round attacks using [[Biclique attack|biclique cryptanalysis]] have been introduced on ''PRESENT''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Biclique cryptanalysis of PRESENT-80 and PRESENT-128|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-014-1103-3|journal = The Journal of Supercomputing|date = 2014-01-28|issn = 0920-8542|pages = 95–103|volume = 70|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/s11227-014-1103-3|language = en|first = Changhoon|last = Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Biclique cryptanalysis of MIBS-80 and PRESENT-80 block ciphers|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sec.1375/abstract|journal = Security and Communication Networks|date = 2015-10-06|issn = 1939-0122|pages = |doi = 10.1002/sec.1375|language = en|first = Mohammad Hossein|last = Faghihi Sereshgi|first2 = Mohammad|last2 = Dakhilalian|first3 = Mohsen|last3 = Shakiba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By design all block ciphers with a block size of 64 bit can have problems with block collisions if they are used with large amounts of data.&lt;ref&gt;

It can be used to find the roots of a [[forest (graph theory)|forest]] of [[rooted tree]]s, and can also be applied to parallelize many other [[graph algorithm]]s including [[connected component (graph theory)|connected component]]s, [[minimum spanning trees]], and [[biconnected components]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite books |first=Joseph |last=JáJá |title=An Introduction to Parallel Algorithms |publisher=Addison Wesley |year=1992 |isbn=0-201-54856-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== List ranking ==

One of the simpler tasks that can be solved by a pointer jumping algorithm is the ''list ranking'' problem. This problem is defined as follows: given a linked list of {{mvar|N}} nodes, find the distance (measured in the number of nodes) of each node to the end of the list. The distance {{mono|d(n)}} is defined as follows, for nodes {{mono|n}} that point to their successor by a pointer called {{mono|next}}:

* If {{mono|n.next}} is [[Null pointer|{{mono|nil}}]], then {{mono|d(n) {{=}} 0}}.
* For any other node, {{mono|d(n) {{=}} d(n.next) + 1}}.

This problem can easily be solved in linear time on a sequential machine, but a parallel algorithm can do better: given {{mvar|n}} processors, the problem can be solved in [[logarithmic time]], {{math|''O''(log ''N'')}}, by the following pointer jumping algorithm:&lt;ref name="clrs"&gt;{{Introduction to Algorithms|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|693}}

** If {{mono|n.next {{=}} nil}}, set {{mono|d[n] ← 0}}.
** Else, set {{mono|d[n] ← 1}}.
* While any node {{mono|n}} has {{mono|n.next ≠ nil}}:
** For each processor/list node {{mvar|n}}, in parallel:
*** If {{mono|n.next ≠ nil}}:
**** Set {{mono|d[n] ← d[n] + d[n.next]}}.
**** Set {{mono|n.next ← n.next.next}}.
{{frame-footer}}
&lt;/div&gt;

The pointer jumping occurs in the last line of the algorithm, where each node's {{mono|next}} pointer is reset to skip the node's direct successor. It is assumed, as in common in the [[parallel random access machine|PRAM]] model of computation, that memory access are performed in lock-step, so that each {{mono|n.next.next}} memory fetch is performed before each {{mono|n.next}} memory store; otherwise, processors may clobber each other's data, producing inconsistencies.{{r|clrs}}{{rp|694}}

Analyzing the algorithm yields a logarithmic running time. The initialization loop takes constant time, because each of the {{mvar|N}} processors performs a constant amount of work, all in parallel. The inner loop of the main loop also takes constant time, as does (by assumption) the termination check for the loop, so the running time is determined by how often this inner loop is executed. Since the pointer jumping in each iteration splits the list into two parts, one consisting of the "odd" elements and one of the "even" elements, the length of the list pointed to by each processor's {{mono|n}} is halved in each iteration, which can be done at most  {{math|''O''(log ''N'')}} time before each list has a length of at most one.{{r|clrs}}{{rp|694–695}}

== Root finding ==

Following a [[path (graph theory)|path]] in a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is an inherently serial operation, but pointer jumping reduces the total amount of work by following all paths simultaneously and sharing results among dependent operations. Pointer jumping iterates and finds a ''successor'' — a [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] closer to the tree root — each time. By following successors computed for other vertices, the traversal down each path can be doubled every iteration, which means that the tree roots can be found in [[logarithmic time]].

Pointer doubling operates on an array &lt;tt&gt;successor&lt;/tt&gt; with an entry for every vertex in the graph. Each &lt;tt&gt;successor[''i'']&lt;/tt&gt; is initialized with the parent index of vertex &lt;tt&gt;''i''&lt;/tt&gt; if that vertex is not a root or to &lt;tt&gt;''i''&lt;/tt&gt; itself if that vertex is a root. At each iteration, each successor is updated to its successor's successor. The root is found when the successor's successor points to itself.

The following [[pseudocode]] demonstrates the algorithm.

 '''Input:''' An array parent representing a forest of trees. parent[i] is the parent of vertex i or itself for a root
 '''Output:''' An array containing the root ancestor for every vertex
 
 '''for''' ''i'' ← 1 '''to''' length(parent) '''do in parallel'''
     successor[''i''] ← parent[''i'']
 '''while''' true
     '''for''' ''i'' ← 1 '''to''' length(successor) '''do in parallel'''
        successor_next[''i''] ← successor[successor[''i'']]
    '''if''' successor_next = successor '''then'''
        break
     '''for''' ''i'' ← 1 '''to''' length(successor) '''do in parallel'''
        successor[''i''] ← successor_next[''i'']
 '''return''' successor

The following image provides an example of using pointer jumping on a small forest. On each iteration the successor points to the vertex following one more successor. After two iterations, every vertex points to its root node.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2737">The '''Press–Schechter formalism''' is a [[mathematical model]] for predicting the number of objects (such as [[galaxies]] or [[galaxy clusters]]) of a certain mass within a given volume of the Universe. It was described in a famous [[Academic paper|paper]] by [[William H. Press]] and [[Paul L. Schechter|Paul Schechter]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1974ApJ...187..425P Formation of Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies by Self-Similar Gravitational Condensation], W.H. Press, P. Schechter, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In the context of [[Dark matter|cold dark matter]] cosmological models,
perturbations on all scales are imprinted on the universe at very early times,
for example by quantum fluctuations during an [[Inflationary cosmology|inflationary era]].
Later, as radiation redshifts away, these become mass perturbations, and they
start to grow linearly.  Only long after that, starting with small mass scales
and advancing over time to larger mass scales, do the perturbations actually
collapse to form (for example) galaxies or clusters of galaxies, in so-called
hierarchical structure formation (see [[Physical cosmology]]).

Press and Schechter observed that the fraction of mass in collapsed objects
more massive than some mass M is related to the fraction of volume samples
in which the smoothed initial density fluctuations are above some
density threshold.  This yields a formula for the mass function (distribution
of masses) of objects at any given time.

==Result==

The Press–Schechter formalism predicts that the number of objects with mass between &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M+dM&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;N(M)dM = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\left(1+\frac{n}{3}\right)\frac{\bar{\rho}}{M^2}\left(\frac{M}{M^*}\right)^{\left(3+n\right)/6}\exp\left(-\left(\frac{M}{M^*}\right)^{\left(3+n\right)/3}\right)dM&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\bar{\rho}&lt;/math&gt; is the mean (baryonic and dark) matter density of the universe, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the index of the power spectrum of the fluctuations in the early universe &lt;math&gt;P(k)\propto k^n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;M^*&lt;/math&gt; is a critical mass above which structures will form.

Qualitatively, the prediction is that the mass distribution is a power law for
small masses, with an exponential cutoff above some characteristic mass that
increases with time.  Such functions had previously been noted by Schechter
as observed [[Luminosity function (astronomy)|luminosity functions]],
and are now known as Schechter luminosity functions.  The Press-Schechter
formalism provided the first quantitative model for how such functions might
arise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7028">'''Rodica Eugenia Simion''' (January 18, 1955 – January 7, 2000) was a [[Romanian-American]] mathematician.  She was the Columbian School Professor of Mathematics at [[George Washington University]]. Her research concerned [[combinatorics]]: she was a pioneer in the study of [[permutation pattern]]s, and an expert on [[noncrossing partition]]s.

==Biography==
Simion was one of the top competitors in the Romanian national [[International Mathematical Olympiad|mathematical olympiads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=GW mourns after math professor passes away|first=Theresa|last=Crapanzano|date=January 20, 2000|journal=The GW Hatchet|url=http://www.gwhatchet.com/2000/01/20/gw-mourns-after-math-professor-passes-away/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from the [[University of Bucharest]] in 1974, and immigrated to the United States in 1976.&lt;ref name="stanley"&gt;{{citation|first=Richard P.|last=Stanley|authorlink=Richard P. Stanley|journal=Pi Mu Epsilon Journal|volume=11|year=2000|pages=83–86|title=Rodica Simion: January 18, 1955 – January 7, 2000|url=http://www-math.mit.edu/~rstan/papers/pimuep.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She did her graduate studies at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], earning a Ph.D. in 1981 under the supervision of [[Herbert Wilf]].&lt;ref name="stanley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|id=15214}}&lt;/ref&gt; After teaching at [[Southern Illinois University]] and [[Bryn Mawr College]], she moved to George Washington University in 1987, and became Columbian School Professor in 1997.&lt;ref name="stanley"/&gt;

==Research contributions==
Simion's thesis research concerned the [[concave function|concavity]] and [[unimodal function|unimodality]] of certain combinatorially defined sequences,&lt;ref name="wilf"&gt;{{citation|title=Rodica Simion (1955–2000)|first=Herbert|last=Wilf|authorlink=Herbert Wilf|url=http://www.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/Remembrances/Simion.html|publisher=Remarks at a special session of an AMS meeting in Washington, D.C.|date=January 2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and included what [[Richard P. Stanley]] calls "a very influential result" that the zeros of certain polynomials are all real.&lt;ref name="stanley"/&gt;

Next, with Frank Schmidt, she was one of the first to study the combinatorics of [[permutation pattern|sets of permutations defined by forbidden patterns]]; she found a [[bijective proof]] that the [[stack-sortable permutation]]s and the permutations formed by interleaving two monotonic sequences are equinumerous, and found [[Enumerations of specific permutation classes|combinatorial enumerations of many permutation classes]].&lt;ref name="stanley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilf"/&gt; The "simsun permutations" were named after her and Sheila Sundaram, after their initial studies of these objects;&lt;ref name="z"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simion also did extensive research on [[noncrossing partition]]s, and became "perhaps the world's leading authority" on them.&lt;ref name="stanley"/&gt;

==Other activities==
Simion was the main organizer of an exhibit about mathematics, ''Beyond Numbers'', at the [[Maryland Science Center]], based in part on her earlier experience organizing a similar exhibit at George Washington University.&lt;ref name="stanley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Rodion Osievich Kuzmin''' ({{lang-ru|Родион Осиевич Кузьмин}}, Nov. 9, 1891, Riabye village in the [[Haradok]] district &amp;ndash; March 24, 1949, [[Leningrad]]) was a [[Russia]]n [[mathematician]], known for his works in [[number theory]] and [[mathematical analysis|analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Venkov|first=B. A.|last2=Natanson|first2=I. P.|author2-link=Isidor Natanson|title=R. O. Kuz’min (1891–1949) (obituary)|journal=Uspekhi Matematicheskikh Nauk|volume=4|issue=4|pages=148&amp;ndash;155|url=http://mi.mathnet.ru/umn8643}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His name is sometimes transliterated as Kusmin. He was an Invited Speaker of the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1928 in Bologna.&lt;ref&gt;Kuzmin, R. "Sur un problème de Gauss." In ''Atti del Congresso Internazionale dei Matematici: Bologna del 3 al 10 de settembre di 1928'', vol. 6, pp. 83–90. 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected results==
* In 1928, Kuzmin solved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuzmin|first=R.O.|title=On a problem of Gauss|journal=Dokl. Akad. Nauk SSSR|year=1928|pages=375&amp;ndash;380}}&lt;/ref&gt; the following problem due to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] (see [[Gauss&amp;ndash;Kuzmin distribution]]): if ''x'' is a random number chosen uniformly in (0,&amp;nbsp;1), and
::&lt;math&gt; x = \frac{1}{k_1 + \frac{1}{k_2 + \cdots}}&lt;/math&gt;
:is its [[continued fraction]] expansion, find a bound for
::&lt;math&gt; \Delta_n(s) = \mathbb{P} \left\{ x_n \leq s \right\} - \log_2(1+s),&lt;/math&gt;
:where
::&lt;math&gt; x_n = \frac{1}{k_{n+1} + \frac{1}{k_{n+2} + \cdots}} .&lt;/math&gt;
:Gauss showed that ''&amp;Delta;''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tends to zero as ''n'' goes to infinity, however, he was unable to give an explicit bound. Kuzmin showed that
::&lt;math&gt;  |\Delta_n(s)| \leq  C e^{- \alpha \sqrt{n}}~,&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''C'',''&amp;alpha;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 are numerical constants. In 1929, the bound was improved to ''C''&amp;nbsp;0.7&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; by [[Paul Lévy (mathematician)|Paul Lévy]].

* In 1930, Kuzmin proved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuzmin|first=R. O.|title=On a new class of transcendental numbers|journal=Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR (math.)|volume=7|year=1930|pages=585&amp;ndash;597|url=http://mi.mathnet.ru/eng/izv5316}}&lt;/ref&gt; that numbers of the form ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''a'' is [[algebraic number|algebraic]] and ''b'' is a real [[quadratic irrational]], are [[transcendental number|transcendental]]. In particular, this result implies that [[Gelfond–Schneider constant]]
::&lt;math&gt;2^{\sqrt{2}}=2.6651441426902251886502972498731\ldots&lt;/math&gt;
:is transcendental. See [[Gelfond–Schneider theorem]] for later developments.

* He is also known for the [[Kusmin-Landau inequality]]: If &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; is continuously differentiable with monotonic derivative &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt; \Vert f'(x) \Vert \geq \lambda &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;  (where &lt;math&gt;\Vert \cdot \Vert &lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Nearest integer function]]) on a finite interval &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, then 
::&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n\in I} e^{2\pi if(n)}\ll \lambda^{-1}. &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2196">In [[mathematics]] &amp;mdash; more specifically, in [[functional analysis]] and [[numerical analysis]] &amp;mdash; '''Stechkin's lemma''' is a result about the [[Lp space|ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; norm]] of the tail of a [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]], when the whole sequence is known to have finite ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; norm.  Here, the term &amp;ldquo;tail&amp;rdquo; means those terms in the sequence that are not among the ''N'' largest terms, for an arbitrary [[natural number]] ''N''.  Stechkin's lemma is often useful when [[approximation theory|analysing]] best-''N''-term approximations to [[function (mathematics)|functions]] in a given basis of a [[function space]].  The result was originally proved by Stechkin in the case &lt;math&gt;q = 2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Statement of the lemma==

Let &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; p &lt; q &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; be a countable [[index set]].  Let &lt;math&gt;(a_{i})_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; be any sequence indexed by &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, and for &lt;math&gt;N \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; let &lt;math&gt;I_{N} \subset I&lt;/math&gt; be the indices of the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; largest terms of the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_{i})_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; in [[absolute value]].  Then

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \sum_{i \in I \setminus I_{N}} | a_{i} |^{q} \right)^{1/q} \leq \left( \sum_{i \in I} | a_{i} |^{p} \right)^{1/p} \frac{1}{N^{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;r = \frac{1}{p} - \frac{1}{q} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, Stechkin's lemma controls the ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; norm of the tail of the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_{i})_{i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; (and hence the ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; norm of the difference between the sequence and its approximation using its &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; largest terms)  in terms of the ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; norm of the full sequence and an rate of decay.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5567">In [[probability theory]], '''stochastic drift''' is the change of the average value of a [[stochastic process|stochastic (random) process]].  A related concept is the '''drift rate,''' which is the rate at which the average changes. For example, a process that counts the number of heads in a series of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; fair [[coin toss]]es has a drift rate of 1/2 per toss. This is in contrast to the random fluctuations about this average value. The stochastic mean of that coin-toss process is 1/2 and the drift rate of the stochastic mean is 0, assuming 1=heads and 0=tails.

==Stochastic drifts in population studies==
[[Longitudinal studies]] of secular events are frequently conceptualized as consisting of a trend component fitted by a [[polynomial]], a cyclical component often fitted by an analysis based on [[autocorrelation]]s or on a [[Fourier series]], and a random component (stochastic drift) to be removed.

In the course of the [[time series analysis]], identification of cyclical and stochastic drift components is often attempted by alternating autocorrelation analysis and differencing of the trend. Autocorrelation analysis helps to identify the correct phase of the fitted model while the successive differencing transforms the stochastic drift component into [[white noise]].

Stochastic drift can also occur in [[population genetics]] where it is known as [[genetic drift]].  A ''finite'' population of randomly reproducing organisms would experience changes from generation to generation in the frequencies of the different genotypes.  This may lead to the fixation of one of the genotypes, and even the emergence of a [[speciation|new species]].  In sufficiently small populations, drift can also neutralize the effect of deterministic [[natural selection]] on the population.

==Stochastic drift in economics and finance==

Time series variables in economics and finance — for example, [[stock price]]s, [[gross domestic product]], etc. — generally evolve stochastically and frequently are [[Stationary process|non-stationary]]. They are typically modelled as either [[trend stationary]] or [[Unit root|difference stationary]].  A trend stationary process {''y''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;} evolves according to

:&lt;math&gt;y_t = f(t) + e_t&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is time, ''f'' is a deterministic function, and ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is a zero-long-run-mean stationary random variable.  In this case the stochastic term is stationary and hence there is no stochastic drift, though the time series itself may drift with no fixed long-run mean due to the deterministic component ''f''(''t'') not having a fixed long-run mean. This non-stochastic drift can be removed from the data by regressing &lt;math&gt;y_t&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; using a functional form coinciding with that of ''f'', and retaining the stationary residuals. In contrast, a unit root (difference stationary) process evolves according to 

:&lt;math&gt;y_t = y_{t-1} + c + u_t&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_t&lt;/math&gt; is a zero-long-run-mean stationary random variable; here ''c'' is a non-stochastic drift parameter: even in the absence of the random shocks ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;, the mean of ''y'' would change by ''c'' per period.  In this case the non-stationarity can be removed from the data by [[first difference|first differencing]], and the differenced variable &lt;math&gt;z_t = y_t - y_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt; will have a long-run mean of ''c'' and hence no drift. But even in the absence of the parameter ''c'' (that is, even if ''c''=0), this unit root process exhibits drift, and specifically stochastic drift, due to the presence of the stationary random shocks ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;: a once-occurring non-zero value of ''u'' is incorporated into the same period's ''y'', which one period later becomes the one-period-lagged value of ''y'' and hence affects the new period's ''y'' value, which itself in the next period  becomes the lagged ''y'' and affects the next ''y'' value, and so forth forever. So after the initial shock hits ''y'', its value is incorporated forever into the mean of ''y'', so we have stochastic drift. Again this drift can be removed by first differencing ''y'' to obtain ''z'' which does not drift.

In the context of [[monetary policy]], one policy question is whether a central bank should attempt to achieve a fixed growth rate of the [[price level]] from its current level in each time period, or whether to target a return of the price level to a predetermined growth path.  In the latter case no price level drift is allowed away from the predetermined path, while in the former case any stochastic change to the price level permanently affects the expected values of the price level at each time along its future path.  In either case the price level has drift in the sense of a rising expected value, but the cases differ according to the type of non-stationarity: difference stationarity in the former case, but trend stationarity in the latter case.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22868">The '''time-weighted return (TWR)'''&lt;ref&gt;''Measuring Investment Performance of Pension Funds'', Bank Administration Institute, December 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ínvestment Performance Measurement'', William G. Bain, Woodhead Publishing; 1 edition (March 13, 1996) {{ISBN|978-1855731950}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of calculating investment return. To apply the time-weighted return method, combine the returns over sub-periods, by compounding them together, resulting in the overall period return. The rate of return over each different sub-period is weighted according to the duration of the sub-period.

The time-weighted method differs from other methods of calculating investment return only in the particular way it compensates for external flows - see below.

==External flows==
The time-weighted return is a measure of the historical performance of an investment portfolio which compensates for ''external flows''. External flows are net movements of value which result from transfers of cash, securities or other instruments, into or out of the portfolio, with no simultaneous equal and opposite movement of value in the opposite direction, as in the case of a purchase or sale, and which are not income from the investments in the portfolio, such as interest, coupons or dividends.

To compensate for external flows, the overall time interval under analysis is divided into contiguous sub-periods at each point in time within the overall time period whenever there is an external flow. In general, these sub-periods will be of unequal lengths. The returns over the sub-periods between external flows are linked geometrically (compounded) together, i.e. by multiplying together the growth factors in all the sub-periods. (The growth factor in each sub-period is equal to 1 plus the return over the sub-period.)

===The problem of external flows===
To illustrate the problem of external flows, consider the following example.

====Example 1====
Suppose an investor transfers $500 into a portfolio at the beginning of Year 1, and another $1,000 at the beginning of Year 2, and the portfolio has a total value of $1,500 at the end of the Year 2. The net gain over the two-year period is zero, so intuitively, we might expect that the return over the whole 2-year period to be 0%. If the cash flow of $1,000 at the beginning of Year 2 is ignored, then the simple method of calculating the return without compensating for the flow will be 200% ($1,000 divided by $500). Intuitively, 200% is incorrect.

If we add further information however, a different picture emerges. If the initial investment gained 100% in value over the first year, but the portfolio then declined by 25% during the second year, we would expect the overall return over the two-year period to be the result of compounding a 100% gain ($500) with a 25% loss (also $500). The time-weighted return is found by multiplying together the growth factors for each year, i.e. the growth factors before and after the second transfer into the portfolio, then subtracting one, and expressing the result as a percentage:

:&lt;math&gt;(1+1.0)(1-0.25)-1 = 2.0 \times 0.75-1 = 1.5-1 = 0.5 = 50\% &lt;/math&gt;.

We can see from the time-weighted return that the absence of any net gain over the two-year period was due to bad timing of the cash inflow at the beginning of the second year.

The time-weighted return appears in this example to overstate the return to the investor, because he sees no net gain. However, by reflecting the performance each year compounded together on an equalized basis, the time-weighted return recognizes the performance of the investment activity independently of the poor timing of the cash flow at the beginning of Year 2. If all the money had been invested at the beginning of Year 1, the return by any measure would most likely have been 50%. $1,500 would have grown by 100% to $3,000 at the end of Year 1, and then declined by 25% to $2,250 at the end of Year 2, resulting in an overall gain of $750, i.e. 50% of $1,500.

=== Adjustment for flows ===
Measuring the performance of a portfolio in the absence of flows is trivial:

:&lt;math&gt;r= \frac{M_2 -M_1}{M_1}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; is the portfolio's final value, &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; is the portfolio's initial value, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the portfolio's return over the period.

The growth factor is:

:&lt;math&gt;1+r= \frac{M_2}{M_1}&lt;/math&gt;

External flows during the period being analyzed complicate the performance calculation.  If external flows are not taken into account, the performance measurement is distorted: a flow into the portfolio would cause this method to overstate the true performance, while flows out of the portfolio would cause it to understate the true performance.

To compensate for an external flow &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; into the portfolio at the ''beginning'' of the period, adjust the portfolio's initial value &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; by adding &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt;. The return is:

:&lt;math&gt;r= \frac{M_2 - (M_1 + C_1)}{M_1 + C_1}&lt;/math&gt;

and the corresponding growth factor is:

:&lt;math&gt;1+r= \frac{M_2}{M_1 + C_1}&lt;/math&gt;

To compensate for an external flow &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt; into the portfolio just before the valuation &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; at the ''end'' of the period, adjust the portfolio's final value &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; by subtracting &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;. The return is:

:&lt;math&gt;r= \frac{(M_2 - C_2) - M_1}{M_1}&lt;/math&gt;

and the corresponding growth factor is:

:&lt;math&gt;1+r= \frac{M_2 - C_2}{M_1}&lt;/math&gt;

===Time-weighted return compensating for external flows===
Suppose that the portfolio is valued immediately after each external flow. The value of the portfolio at the end of each sub-period is adjusted for the external flow which takes place immediately before. External flows into the portfolio are considered positive and flows out of the portfolio are negative.

:&lt;math&gt;1+r= \frac{M_1 -C_1}{M_0}\times\frac{M_2 -C_2}{M_1}\times\frac{M_3 -C_3}{M_2}\times \cdots \times\frac{M_{n-1} -C_{n-1}}{M_{n-2}}\times\frac{M_{n} -C_{n}}{M_{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the "true time-weighted return" of the portfolio,

:&lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial portfolio value,

:&lt;math&gt;M_t&lt;/math&gt; is the portfolio value at the end of sub-period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, immediately after external flow &lt;math&gt;C_t&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;M_n&lt;/math&gt; is the final portfolio value,

:&lt;math&gt;C_t&lt;/math&gt; is the net external flow into the portfolio which occurs just before the end of sub-period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;,

and
:&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of sub-periods.

Note that if there is an external flow occurring at the end of the overall period, then the number of sub-periods &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; matches the number of flows. However, if there is no flow at the end of the overall period, then &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; is zero, and the number of sub-periods &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is one greater than the number of flows.

Note also that if the portfolio is valued immediately before each flow instead of immediately after, then each flow should be used to adjust the starting value within each sub-period, instead of the ending value, resulting in a different formula:

:&lt;math&gt;1+r= \frac{M_1}{M_0 +C_0}\times\frac{M_2}{M_1+C_1}\times\frac{M_3}{M_2 +C_2}\times...\times\frac{M_{n-1}}{M_{n-2} +C_{n-2}}\times\frac{M_{n}}{M_{n-1} +C_{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the "true time-weighted return" of the portfolio,

:&lt;math&gt;M_0&lt;/math&gt; is the initial portfolio value,

:&lt;math&gt;M_t&lt;/math&gt; is the portfolio value at the end of sub-period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, immediately before external flow &lt;math&gt;C_t&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;M_n&lt;/math&gt; is the final portfolio value,

:&lt;math&gt;C_t&lt;/math&gt; is the net external flow into the portfolio which occurs at the beginning of sub-period &lt;math&gt;{t+1}&lt;/math&gt;,

and
:&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of sub-periods.

==Explanation==

===Why it is called "time-weighted"===

The term ''time-weighted'' is best illustrated with ''continuous (logarithmic) rates of return''. The overall rate of return is the time-weighted average of the continuous rate of return in each sub-period.

In the absence of flows,

:&lt;math&gt;\text {End value} = \text {start value} \times e^{rt}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the ''[[rate of return|continuous rate of return]]'' and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the length of time.

====Example 2====

Over a period of a decade, a portfolio grows by a continuous rate of return of 5% p.a. over three of those years, and 10% p.a. over the other seven years.

:&lt;math&gt;\text {End value} = \text {start value} \times e^{0.05 \times 3} \times e^{0.10 \times 7}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;=\text {start value} \times e^{\left(0.05 \times \frac {3}{10} + 0.10 \times \frac {7}{10} \right) \times 10}&lt;/math&gt;

The continuous time-weighted rate of return over the ten-year period is the time-weighted average:

:&lt;math&gt;5\% \times \frac{3}{10} + 10\% \times \frac{7}{10} =
\frac{5\% \times 3 + 10\% \times 7}{10} = 8.5\%&lt;/math&gt;

===Ordinary time-weighted rate of return===

====Example 3====

Consider another example to calculate the annualized ordinary rate of return over a five-year period of an investment which returns 10% p.a. for two of the five years, and -3% p.a. for the other three. The ordinary time-weighted return over the five-year period is:

:&lt;math&gt;(1+0.10)(1+0.10)(1-0.03)(1-0.03)(1-0.03)-1&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= 1.1^2 \times 0.97^3-1&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= 0.104334\ldots &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= 10.4334\ldots\% &lt;/math&gt;

and after annualization, the rate of return is:

:&lt;math&gt;(1.1^2 \times 0.97^3)^{1/(2+3)} -1&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = 1.0200\ldots-1&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= 2.00\ldots\% \text { p.a.}&lt;/math&gt;

The length of time over which the rate of return was 10% was two years, which appears in the power of two on the 1.1 factor:

:&lt;math&gt;1.1^2&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, the rate of return was -3% for three years, which appears in the power of three on the 0.97 factor. The result is then annualized over the overall five-year period.

==Portfolio performance measurement==
Investment managers are judged on investment activity which is under their control. If they have no control over the timing of flows, then compensating for the timing of flows, applying the true time-weighted return method to a portfolio, is a superior measure of the performance of the investment manager, at the overall portfolio level.

===Internal flows and the performance of elements within a portfolio===
''Internal flows'' are transactions such as purchases and sales of holdings within a portfolio, in which the cash used for purchases, and the cash proceeds of sales, is also contained in the same portfolio, so there is no external flow. A cash dividend on a stock in a portfolio, which is retained in the same portfolio as the stock, is a flow from the stock to the cash account within the portfolio. It is internal to the portfolio, but external to both the stock and the cash account when they are considered individually, in isolation from one another.

The time-weighted method only captures the effect attributable to the size and timing of internal flows in aggregate, i.e. insofar as they result in the overall performance of the portfolio. This is for the same reason, which is the time-weighted method neutralizes the effect of flows. It therefore does not capture the performance of parts of a portfolio, such as the performance due to individual security-level decisions, so effectively as it captures the overall portfolio performance.

The time-weighted return of a particular security, from initial purchase to eventual final sale, is the same, regardless of the presence or absence of interim purchases and sales, their timing, size and the prevailing market conditions. It always matches the share price performance (including dividends, etc.). Unless this feature of the time-weighted return is the desired objective, it arguably makes the time weighted method less informative than alternative methodologies for investment performance attribution at the level of individual instruments. For performance attribution at individual security level to be meaningful in many cases depends on the return being different from the share price return. If the individual security return matches the share price return, the transaction timing effect is zero.

See Example 4 below, which illustrates this feature of the time-weighted method.

====Example 4====
Let us imagine an investor purchases 10 shares at 10 dollars per share. Then the investor adds another 5 shares in the same company bought at the market price of 12 dollars per share (ignoring transaction costs). The entire holding of 15 shares is then sold at 11 dollars per share.

The second purchase appears to be badly timed, compared with the first. Is this poor timing apparent, from the time-weighted (holding-period) return of the shares, in isolation from the cash in the portfolio?

To calculate the time-weighted return of these particular shareholdings, in isolation from the cash used to purchase the shares, treat the purchase of shares as an external inflow. Then the first sub-period growth factor, preceding the second purchase, when there are just the first 10 shares, is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\text{End value}}{\text {start value}} = \frac {10 \times 12}{10 \times 10} = \frac {120}{100} = 1.2&lt;/math&gt;

and growth factor over the second sub-period, following the second purchase, when there are 15 shares altogether, is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\text{End value}}{\text {start value}} = \frac {15 \times 11}{15 \times 12} = \frac {165}{180} = 0.91666\ldots&lt;/math&gt;

so the overall period growth factor is:

:&lt;math&gt;\text {Product of sub-period growth factors} = \text {first sub-period growth factor} \times \text{second sub-period growth factor}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \frac {120}{100} \times \frac {165}{180}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \frac {120 \times 165}{100 \times 180}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \frac {19,800}{18,000}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= 1.1&lt;/math&gt;

and the time-weighted holding-period return is:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{Growth factor} - 1 = 0.1 = 10\%&lt;/math&gt;

which is the same as the simple return calculated using the change in the share price:

:&lt;math&gt;= \frac {\text {End value} - \text{start value}}{\text{start value}} = \frac {11-10}{10}&lt;/math&gt;

The poor timing of the second purchase has made no difference to the performance of the investment in shares, calculated using the time-weighted method, compared for instance with a pure buy-and-hold strategy (i.e. buying all the shares at the beginning, and holding them until the end of the period).

==Comparison with other returns methods==
Other methods exist to compensate for external flows when calculating investment returns. Such methods are known as "money-weighted" or "dollar-weighted" methods. The time-weighted return is higher than the result of other methods of calculating the investment return when external flows are badly timed - refer to Example 4 above.

===Internal rate of return===
One of these methods is the [[internal rate of return]]. Like the true time-weighted return method, the internal rate of return is also based on a compounding principle. It is the discount rate that will set the [[net present value]] of all external flows and the terminal value equal to the value of the initial investment. However, solving the equation to find an estimate of the internal rate of return generally requires an iterative numerical method and sometimes returns multiple results.

The internal rate of return is commonly used for measuring the performance of [[private equity]] investments, because the principal partner (the investment manager) has greater control over the timing of cash flows, rather than the limited partner (the end investor).

===Simple Dietz method===
{{Main|Simple Dietz method}}
The [[Simple Dietz method]]&lt;ref&gt;Dietz, Peter O. ''Pension Funds: Measuring Investment Performance''. Free Press, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; applies a simple rate of interest principle, as opposed to the compounding principle underlying the internal rate of return method, and further assumes that flows occur at the midpoint within the time interval (or equivalently that they are distributed evenly throughout the time interval).  However, the Simple Dietz method is unsuitable when such assumptions are invalid, and will produce different results to other methods in such a case.

The simple Dietz returns of two or more different constituent assets in a portfolio over the same period can be combined together to derive the simple Dietz portfolio return, by taking the weighted average. The weights are the start value plus half the net inflow.

====Example 5====
Applying the Simple Dietz method to the shares purchased in Example 4 (above):

:&lt;math&gt;\text {Simple Dietz return} = \frac {\text {gain or loss}}{\text {start value} + \frac {1}{2} \times \text {net inflow}}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text {Gain or loss} = \text {end value} - \text {start value} - \text {net inflow}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= 165 - 100 - 60&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= 5&lt;/math&gt;

so

:&lt;math&gt;\text {Simple Dietz return} = \frac {5}{100 + \frac {1}{2} \times 60}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= \frac {5}{130}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;= 3.86 \% \text { (2 d. p.)}&lt;/math&gt;

which is noticeably lower than the 10% time-weighted return.

===Modified Dietz method===
{{Main|Modified Dietz method}}
The [[Modified Dietz method]] is another method which, like the Simple Dietz method, applies a simple rate of interest principle. Instead of comparing the gain in value (net of flows) with the initial value of the portfolio, it compares the net gain in value with average capital over the time interval. Average capital allows for the timing of each external flow.  As the difference between the Modified Dietz method and the internal rate of return method is that the Modified Dietz method is based on a simple rate of interest principle, whereas the internal rate of return method applies a compounding principle, the two methods produce similar results over short time intervals, if the rates of return are low. Over longer time periods, with significant flows relative to the size of the portfolio, and where the returns are not low, then the differences are more significant.

Like the simple Dietz method, the Modified Dietz returns of two or more different constituent assets in a portfolio over the same period can be combined together to derive the Modified Dietz portfolio return, by taking the weighted average. The weight to be applied to the return on each asset in this case is the average capital of the asset.

====Example 6====
Referring again to the scenario described in Examples 4 and 5, if the second purchase occurs exactly halfway through the overall period, the Modified Dietz method has the same result as the Simple Dietz method.

If the second purchase is earlier than halfway through the overall period, the gain, which is 5 dollars, is still the same, but the average capital is greater than the start value plus half the net inflow, making the denominator of the Modified Dietz return greater than that in the Simple Dietz method. In this case, the Modified Dietz return is less than the Simple Dietz return.

If the second purchase is later than halfway through the overall period, the gain, which is 5 dollars, is still the same, but the average capital is less than the start value plus half the net inflow, making the denominator of the Modified Dietz return less than that in the Simple Dietz method. In this case, the Modified Dietz return is greater than the Simple Dietz return.

No matter how late during the period the second purchase of shares occurs, the average capital is greater than 100, and so the Modified Dietz return is less than 5 percent. This is still noticeably less than the 10 percent time weighted return.

===Linked returns methods===
Calculating the "true time-weighted return" depends on the availability of portfolio valuations during the investment period. If valuations are not available when each flow occurs, the time-weighted return can only be estimated by linking returns for contiguous sub-periods together geometrically, using sub-periods at the end of which valuations are available. Such an approximate time-weighted return method is prone to overstate or understate the true time-weighted return.

''Linked Internal Rate of Return (LIROR)'' is another such method which is sometimes used to approximate the true time-weighted return. It combines the true time-weighted rate of return method with the [[internal rate of return]] (IRR) method. The internal rate of return is estimated over regular time intervals, and then the results are linked geometrically. For example, if the internal rate of return over successive years is 4%, 9%, 5% and 11%, then the LIROR equals 1.04 x 1.09 x 1.05 x 1.11 – 1 = 32.12%. If the regular time periods are not years, then either calculate the un-annualized holding period version of the IRR for each time interval, or calculate the IRR for each time interval firstly, and then convert each one to a holding period return over the time interval, then link together these holding period returns to obtain the LIROR.

===Returns methods in the absence of flows===
If there are no external flows, then all these methods (time-weighted return, [[internal rate of return]], [[Modified Dietz Method]] etc.) give identical results - it is only the various ways they handle flows which makes them different from each other.

==Logarithmic returns==
{{further information| rate of return}}
The ''continuous'' or ''logarithmic return'' method is not a competing method of compensating for flows. It is simply the natural logarithm  &lt;math&gt;ln(\frac {M_2}{M_1})&lt;/math&gt; of the growth factor.

==Fees==
To measure returns net of fees, allow the value of the portfolio to be reduced by the amount of the fees. To calculate returns gross of fees, compensate for them by treating them as an external flow, and exclude the negative effect of accrued fees from valuations.

==Annual rate of return==
Any confusion over the meaning of the term ''return'' or ''[[rate of return]]'' should be avoided. The return calculated by these methods is the return per dollar (or per some other unit of currency), not per year (or other unit of time). Annualization, which means conversion to an annual rate of return, is a separate process. Refer to the article [[rate of return]].

The General System has been described in [[Timed_Event_System#References|[Zeigler76]]] and [[Timed_Event_System#References|[ZPK00]]] with the stand points to define (1) the time base, (2) the admissible input segments, (3) the system states, (4) the state trajectory with an admissible input segment, (5) the output for an given state.

A Timed Event System defining the state trajectory associated with the current and [[Event Segment|event segments]] came from the class of General System to allows non-deterministic behaviors in it [[Timed_Event_System#References|[Hwang2012]]]. Since [[Behavior of DEVS|the behaviors of DEVS]] can be described by Timed Event System, [[DEVS]] and [[RTDEVS]] is a sub-class or an equivalent class of Timed Event System.

== Timed Event Systems ==
A timed event system is a structure 
&lt;center&gt; &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}=&lt;Z, Q, Q_0, Q_A,\Delta&gt; &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt; \,Z &lt;/math&gt; is ''the set of events''; 
*&lt;math&gt; \,Q&lt;/math&gt; is ''the set of states''; 
*&lt;math&gt; \,Q_0 \subseteq Q&lt;/math&gt; is ''the set of initial states'';  
*&lt;math&gt; Q_A \subseteq Q&lt;/math&gt; is ''the set of accepting states'';
*&lt;math&gt; \Delta \subseteq Q \times \Omega_{Z,[t_l,t_u]} \times Q&lt;/math&gt;  is ''the set of state trajectories'' in which &lt;math&gt; (q,\omega,q') \in \Delta &lt;/math&gt; indicates that a state &lt;math&gt;q \in Q&lt;/math&gt; can change into &lt;math&gt;q' \in Q&lt;/math&gt; along with an [[Event Segment|event segment]] &lt;math&gt;\omega \in \Omega_{Z,[t_l, t_u]}&lt;/math&gt;. If two state trajectories &lt;math&gt; (q_1,\omega_1,q_2) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(q_3, \omega_2, q_4) \in \Delta &lt;/math&gt; are called contiguous if &lt;math&gt; q_2 = q_3&lt;/math&gt;, and two event trajectories &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega_2 &lt;/math&gt; are contiguous.  Two contiguous state trajectories &lt;math&gt;(q,\omega_1,p) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(p,\omega_2, q') \in \Delta &lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; (q,\omega_1\omega_2,q') \in \Delta &lt;/math&gt;.

== Behaviors and Languages of Timed Event System ==
Given a timed event system &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{G}=&lt;Z,Q,Q_0,Q_A,\Delta&gt;&lt;/math&gt;, ''the set of its behaviors'' is called its ''language'' depending on the
observation time length. Let &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; be the observation time length.
If &lt;math&gt;0 \le t &lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, ''&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;-length observation language of''
&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;L(\mathcal{G}, t)&lt;/math&gt;, and defined as
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; 
L(\mathcal{G},t)=\{\omega \in \Omega_{Z,[0,t]}:  \exists (q_0, \omega, q) \in
\Delta, q_0 \in Q_0, q \in Q_A\}. 
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
We call an event segment &lt;math&gt;\omega \in \Omega_{Z,[0,t]} &lt;/math&gt; a &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;-length behavior of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt; \omega \in L(\mathcal{G},t)&lt;/math&gt;.

By sending the observation time length &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; to infinity, we define ''infinite length observation language of'' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;
is denoted by &lt;math&gt;L(\mathcal{G}, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;, and defined as
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;  
L(\mathcal{G},\infty)= \{\omega \in \underset{t \rightarrow \infty} \lim
\Omega_{Z,[0,t]}: \exists \{q: (q_0, \omega, q) \in
\Delta, q_0 \in Q_0 \} \subseteq Q_A \}. 
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt; 
We call an event segment &lt;math&gt; \omega \in \underset{t \rightarrow \infty} \lim
\Omega_{Z,[0,t]}&lt;/math&gt; an infinite-length behavior of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{G}&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt; \omega \in L(\mathcal{G},\infty)&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Galileo Galilei, Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche Intorno a Due Nuove Scienze, 1638 (1400x1400).png|thumb|[[Galileo Galilei]]: ''Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche Intorno a Due Nuove Scienze'' (1638)]]
The '''''Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences''''' ({{lang-it|Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche Intorno a Due Nuove Scienze}}, {{IPA-it|diˈskorsi e dimostratˈtsjoːni mateˈmaːtike inˈtorno a ˈduːe ˈnwɔːve ˈʃɛntse|pron}}), published in 1638 was [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo's]] final book and a scientific testament covering much of his work in [[physics]] over the preceding thirty years.

After his ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', the [[Roman Inquisition]] had banned the publication of any of Galileo's works, including any he might write in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|_note-publication-ban}}{{Harv|Drake|1978|p=367}} See [[Galileo affair#note-publication-ban|Galileo affair]] for further details.&lt;/ref&gt; After the failure of his initial attempts to publish ''Two New Sciences'' in [[France]], [[Germany]], and [[Poland]], it was published by [[Lodewijk Elzevir]] who was working in [[Leiden]], [[South Holland]], where the writ of the Inquisition was of less consequence (see [[House of Elzevir]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The foundation of mechanics|url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n38/mode/1up|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=Jul 6, 1914|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fra Fulgenzio Micanzio, the official theologian of the Republic of Venice, had initially offered to help Galileo publish in Venice the new work, but he pointed out that publishing the ''Two New Sciences'' in Venice might cause Galileo unnecessary trouble; thus, the book was eventually published in Holland. Galileo did not seem to suffer any harm from the Inquisition for publishing this book since in January 1639, the book reached Rome's bookstores, and all available copies (about fifty) were quickly sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Finocchiaro|editor1-first=Maurice A.|title=The Trial of Galileo: Essential Documents|date=2014|publisher=[[Hackett Publishing Company]]|isbn=1624661327|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Discourses'' was written in a style similar to ''Dialogues'', in which three men (Simplicio, Sagredo, and Salviati) discuss and debate the various questions Galileo is seeking to answer. There is a notable change in the men, however; Simplicio, in particular, is no longer quite as simple-minded, stubborn and Aristotelian as his name implies. His arguments are representative of Galileo's own early beliefs, as Sagredo represents his middle period, and Salviati proposes Galileo's newest models.

==Introduction==
The book is divided into four days, each addressing different areas of physics. Galileo dedicates ''Two New Sciences'' to Lord Count of Noailles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plotnitsky|first=Arkady|author2=Reed, David|title=Discourse, Mathematics, Demonstration, and Science in Galileo's Discourses Concerning Two New Sciences|journal=Configurations|date=1 January 2001|volume=9|issue=1|pages=37–64|doi=10.1353/con.2001.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Figure 1 of Galileo's Two New Sciences (First Day).jpg|thumb|Figure 1 out of Galileo's ''Two New Sciences'' in the First Day section]]
In the First Day, Galileo addressed topics that were discussed in [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's Physics]] and also the Aristotelian school [[Mechanics (Aristotle)|Mechanics]]. It also provides an introduction to the discussion of both of the new sciences. The likeness between the topics discussed, specific questions that are hypothesized, and the style and sources throughout give Galileo the backbone to his First Day. The First Day introduces the speakers in the dialogue: Salviati, Sagredo, and Simplicio, the same as in the [[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogue]]. These three people are all Galileo just at different stages of his life, Simplicio the youngest and Salviati, Galileo's closest counterpart. It also provides an introduction to the discussion of both of the new sciences. The second day addresses the question of the strength of materials.

The Third and Fourth days address the science of motion. The Third day discusses uniform and naturally accelerated motion, the issue of terminal velocity having been addressed in the First day. The Fourth day discusses [[projectile motion]].

In ''Two Sciences'' uniform motion is defined as a motion that, over ''any'' equal periods of time, covers equal distance. With the use of the quantifier ″any″, uniformity is introduced and expressed more explicitly than in previous definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Plotnitsky, Arkady; Reed, David (1 January 2001).

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Day one: Resistance of bodies to separation===
[50] '''Preliminary discussions.''' 
Sagredo (taken to be the younger Galileo) cannot understand why with machines one cannot argue from the small to the large: "I do not see that the properties of circles, triangles and...solid figures should change with their size". Salviati (speaking for Galileo) says the common opinion is wrong. Scale matters: a horse falling from a height of 3 or 4 cubits will break its bones whereas a cat falling from twice the height won't, nor will a grasshopper falling from a tower.

[56] The first example is a hemp rope which is constructed from small fibres which bind together in the same way as a rope round a windlass to produce something much stronger. Then the vacuum that prevents two highly polished plates from separating even though they slide easily gives rise to an experiment to test whether water can be expanded or whether a vacuum is caused. In fact, Sagredo had observed that a suction pump could not lift more than 18 cubits of water and Salviati observes that the weight of this is the amount of resistance to a void. The discussion turns to the strength of a copper wire and whether there are minute void spaces inside the metal or whether there is some other explanation for its strength.

[68] This leads into a discussion of infinites and the continuum and thence to the observation that the number of squares equal the number of roots. He comes eventually to the view that "if any number can be said to be infinite, it must be unity" and demonstrates a construction in which an infinite circle is approached and another to divide a line.

[85] The difference between a fine dust and a liquid leads to a discussion of light and how the concentrated power of the sun can melt metals. He deduces that light has motion and describes an (unsuccessful) attempt to measure its speed.

[106] Aristotle believed that bodies fell at a speed proportional to weight but Salviati doubts that Aristotle ever tested this. He also did not believe that motion in a void was possible, but since air is much less dense than water Salviati asserts that in a medium devoid of resistance (a vacuum) all bodies—a lock of wool or a bit of lead—would fall at the same speed. Large and small bodies fall at the same speed through air or water providing they are of the same density. Since ebony weighs a thousand times as much as air (which he had measured), it will fall only a very little more slowly than lead which weighs ten times as much. But shape also matters—even a piece of gold leaf (the heaviest of metals) floats through the air and a bladder filled with air falls much more slowly than lead.

[128] Measuring the speed of a fall is difficult because of the small time intervals involved and his first way round this used pendulums of the same length but with lead or cork weights. The period of oscillation was the same, even when the cork was swung more widely to compensate for the fact that it soon stopped.

[139] This leads to a discussion of the vibration of strings and he suggests that not only the length of the string is important for pitch but also the tension and the weight of the string.

===Day two: Cause of cohesion===
[151] Salviati proves that a balance can not only be used with equal arms but with unequal arms with weights inversely proportional to the distances from the fulcrum. Following this he shows that the moment of a weight suspended by a beam supported at one end is proportional to the square of the length. The resistance to fracture of beams of various sizes and thicknesses is demonstrated, supported at one or both ends.

[169] He shows that animal bones have to be proportionately larger for larger animals and the length of a cylinder that will break under its own weight. He proves that the best place to break a stick placed upon the knee is the middle and shows how far along a beam that a larger weight can be placed without breaking it.

[178] He proves that the optimum shape for a beam supported at one end and bearing a load at the other is parabolic. He also shows that hollow cylinders are stronger than solid ones of the same weight.

===Day three: Naturally accelerated motion===
[191] He first defines uniform (steady) motion and shows the relationship between speed, time and distance. He then defines uniformly accelerated motion where the speed increases by the same amount in increments of time. [[Falling bodies]] start very slowly and he sets out to show that their velocity increases in simple proportionality to time, not to distance which he shows is impossible.

[208] He shows that the distance travelled in naturally accelerated motion is proportional to the square of the time. He describes an experiment in which a steel ball was rolled down a groove in a piece of wooden moulding 12 cubits long (about 5.5m) with one end raised by one or two cubits. This was repeated, measuring times by accurately weighing the amount of water that came out of a thin pipe in a jet from the bottom of a large jug of water. By this means he was able to verify the uniformly accelerated motion. He then shows that whatever the inclination of the plane, the square of the time taken to fall a given vertical height is proportional to the inclined distance.

[221] He next considers descent along the chords of a circle, showing that the time is the same as that falling from the vertex, and various other combinations of planes. He gives an erroneous solution to the [[brachistochrone curve|brachistochrone problem]], claiming to prove that the arc of the circle is the fastest descent. 16 problems with solutions are given.

===Day four: The motion of projectiles===
[[File:Figure 126 of Galileo's Two New Sciences out of the Fourth Day section.jpg|thumb|Figure 126 of Galileo's ''Two New Sciences'' out of the Fourth Day section]]
[268] The motion of projectiles consists of a combination of uniform horizontal motion and a naturally accelerated vertical motion which produces a [[Parabola|parabolic]] curve. Two motions at right angles can be calculated using the sum of the squares. He shows in detail how to construct the parabolas in various situations and gives tables for altitude and range depending on the projected angle.

[274] Air resistance shows itself in two ways: by affecting less dense bodies more and by offering greater resistance to faster bodies. A lead ball will fall slightly faster than an oak ball, but the difference with a stone ball is negligible. However the speed does not go on increasing indefinitely but reaches a maximum. Though at small speeds the effect of air resistance is small, it is greater when considering, say, a ball fired from a cannon.

[292] The effect of a projectile hitting a target is reduced if the target is free to move. The velocity of a moving body can overcome that of a larger body if its speed is proportionately greater than the resistance.

[310] A cord or chain stretched out is never level but also approximates to a parabola. (But see also [[catenary]].)

==Methodology==
Many contemporary scientists, such as [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], dispute Galileo’s methodology for conceptualizing his law of falling bodies. Two of the main arguments are that his epistemology followed the example of Platonist thought or hypothetico-deductivist. It has now been considered to be ''ex suppositione'', or knowing the how and why effects from past events in order to determine the requirements for the production of similar effects in the future. Galileo methodology mirrored that of Aristotelian and Archimedean epistemology. Following a letter from [[Cardinal Bellarmine]] in 1615 Galileo distinguished his arguments and [[Copernicus]]' as natural suppositions as opposed to the “fictive” that are “introduced only for the sake of astronomical computations,” such as [[Plato]]'s hypothesis on eccentrics and equants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Jones|title=Galileo and Reasoning Ex Suppositione: The Methodology of the Two New Sciences|journal=PSA:Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association|volume=1974|pages=90|jstor=495799|doi=10.1007/978-94-010-1449-6_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo’s earlier writing considered Juvenilia, or youthful writings, are considered his first attempts at creating lecture notes for his course “hypothesis of the celestial motions” while teaching in at the [[University of Padua]]. These notes mirrored those of his contemporaries at the Collegio as well as contained an “Aristotelian context with decided Thomistic ([[St. Thomas Aquinas]]) overtones.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Jones|title=Galileo and Reasoning Ex Suppositione: The Methodology of the Two New Sciences|journal=PSA:Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association|volume=1974|pages=86|jstor=495799|doi=10.1007/978-94-010-1449-6_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These earlier papers are believed to have encouraged him to apply demonstrative proof in order to give validity to his discoveries on motion.

Discovery of folio 116v gives evidence of experiments that had previously not been reported and therefore demonstrated Galileo’s actual calculations for the Law of Falling Bodies.

His methods of experimentation have been proved by the recording and recreation done by scientists such as James MacLachlan, Stillman Drake, R.H. Taylor and others in order to prove he did not merely imagine his ideas as historian [[Alexandre Koyré]] argued, but sought to prove them mathematically.

Galileo believed that knowledge could be acquired through reason, and reinforced through observation and experimentation. Thus, it can be argued that Galileo was a rationalist, and also that he was an empiricist.

==The two new sciences==
The two sciences mentioned in the title are the strength of materials and the motion of objects (the forbearers of modern [[materials science|material engineering]] and [[kinematics]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tucker McElroy, ''A to Z of Mathematicians'', Facts on File (Infobase Publishing), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In the title of the book "mechanics" and "motion" are separate, since at Galileo's time "mechanics" meant only [[statics]] and strength of materials.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Gindikin]], ''Tales of Physicists and Mathematicians'', Springer Science &amp; Business Media, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo had started an additional section on the force of percussion, but was not able to complete it to his own satisfaction.

===The science of materials===
The discussion begins with a demonstration of the reasons that a large structure proportioned in exactly the same way as a smaller one must necessarily be weaker known as the [[square–cube law]]. Later in the discussion this principle is applied to the thickness required of the bones of a large animal, possibly the first quantitative result in [[biology]], anticipating [[J. B. S. Haldane]]'s work ''On Being the Right Size, and other essays,'' edited by [[John Maynard Smith]].

===The motion of objects===
Galileo expresses clearly for the first time the constant acceleration of a falling body which he was able to measure accurately by slowing it down using an inclined plane.

In ''Two New Sciences'', Galileo (Salviati speaks for him) used a wood [[Molding (decorative)|molding]], "12 cubits long, half a cubit wide and three finger-breadths thick" as a [[Inclined plane|ramp]] with a straight, smooth, polished [[Groove (engineering)|groove]] to study rolling balls ("a hard, smooth and very round bronze ball"). He lined the groove with "[[parchment]], also smooth and polished as possible". He inclined the ramp at various angles, effectively slowing down the acceleration enough so that he could measure the elapsed time. He would let the ball roll a known distance down the ramp, and use a [[water clock]] to measure the time taken to move the known distance. This clock was
&lt;blockquote&gt;a large vessel of water placed in an elevated position; to the bottom of this vessel was soldered a pipe of small diameter giving a thin jet of water, which we collected in a small glass during the time of each descent, whether for the whole length of the channel or for a part of its length. The water collected was weighed, and after each descent on a very accurate balance, the differences and ratios of these weights gave him the differences and ratios of the times. This was done with such accuracy that although the operation was repeated many, many times, there was no appreciable discrepancy in the results.&lt;ref&gt;[[Galileo]] 1638 ''Discorsi e dimostrazioni matematiche, intorno à due nuove scienze'' '''213''', Leida, Appresso gli Elsevirii ([[Leiden]]: [[House of Elzevir|Louis Elsevier]]), or ''Mathematical discourses and demonstrations, relating to Two New Sciences'', English translation by Henry Crew and Alfonso de Salvio 1914.

====The law of falling bodies====
While Aristotle had observed that heavier objects fall more quickly than lighter ones, in ''Two New Sciences'' Galileo postulated that this was due ''not'' to inherently stronger forces acting on the heavier objects, but to the countervailing forces of air resistance and friction. To compensate, he conducted experiments using a shallowly inclined ramp, smoothed so as to eliminate as much friction as possible, on which he rolled down balls of different weights. In this manner, he was able to provide empirical evidence that matter accelerates vertically downward at a constant rate, regardless of mass, due to the effects of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, William. "Galileo and Reasoning Ex Suppositione: The Methodology of the Two New Sciences." (92).&lt;/ref&gt;

The unreported experiment found in folio 116V tested the constant rate of acceleration in falling bodies due to gravity.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, William. "Galileo and Reasoning Ex Suppositione: The Methodology of the Two New Sciences." (96).&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment consisted of dropping a ball from specified heights onto a deflector in order to transfer its motion from vertical to horizontal. The data from the inclined plane experiments were used to calculate the expected horizontal motion. However, discrepancies were found in the results of the experiment: the observed horizontal distances disagreed with the calculated distances expected for a constant rate of acceleration. Galileo attributed the discrepancies to air resistance in the unreported experiment, and friction in the inclined plane experiment. These discrepancies forced Galileo to assert that the postulate held only under "ideal conditions," i.e., in the absence of friction and/or air resistance.

====Bodies in motion====
Aristotelian physics argued that the Earth must not move as humans are unable to perceive the effects of this motion.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Jones. "Gassendi's Defence of Galileo: The Politics of Discretion." (224)&lt;/ref&gt; A popular justification of this is the experiment of an archer shooting an arrow straight up into the air. If the Earth were moving, Aristotle argued, the arrow should fall in a different location than the launch point. Galileo refuted this argument in ''Two New Sciences''. He provided the example of sailors aboard a boat at sea. The boat is obviously in motion, but the sailors are unable to perceive this motion. If a sailor were to drop a weighted object from the mast, this object would fall at the base of the mast rather than behind it (due to the ship's forward motion). This was the result of simultaneously the horizontal and vertical motion of the ship, sailors, and ball.

====Relativity of motions====
[[File:Galileo-1638-173.jpg|thumb|100px|Picture in Galileo's ''Discorsi'' (1638) illustrating relativity of motions]]
One of Galileo’s experiments regarding falling bodies was that describing the relativity of motions, explaining that, under the right circumstances, “one motion may be superimposed upon another without effect upon either…”. In ''Two New Sciences'', Galileo made his case for this argument and it would become the basis of [[Newton's first law]], the law of inertia.

He poses the question of what happens to a ball dropped from the mast of a sailing ship or an arrow fired into the air on the deck. According to [[Aristotle]]'s physics, the ball dropped should land at the stern of the ship as it falls straight down from the point of origin. Likewise the arrow when fired straight up should not land in the same spot if the ship is in motion. Galileo offers that there are two independent motions at play. One is the accelerating vertical motion caused by gravity while the other is the uniform horizontal motion caused by the moving ship which continues to influence the trajectory of the ball through the principle of inertia. The combination of these two motions results in a parabolic curve. The observer cannot identify this parabolic curve because the ball and observer share the horizontal movement imparted to them by the ship, meaning only the perpendicular, vertical motion is perceivable. Surprisingly, nobody had tested this theory with the simple experiments needed to gain a conclusive result until [[Pierre Gassendi]] published the results of said experiments in his letters entitled ''De Motu Impresso a Motore Translato'' (1642).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howard|first=Jones|title=Gassendi's defense of Galileo: The Politics of Discretion|year=1988|publisher=Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies|location=Binghamton, N.Y.|pages=221–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infinity==
{{main article|Galileo's paradox}}

The book also contains a discussion of [[infinity]]. Galileo considers the example of numbers and [[square number|their squares]]. He starts by noting that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It cannot be denied that there are as many [squares] as there are numbers because every number is a [square] root of some square:

1 &amp;harr; 1, 2 &amp;harr; 4, 3 &amp;harr; 9, 4 &amp;harr; 16, and so on. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

(In modern language, there is a [[bijection]] between the elements of the set of positive integers N and the set of squares S, and S is a proper subset of [[Natural density|density zero]].) But he notes what appears to be a contradiction: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yet at the outset we said there are many more numbers than squares, since the larger portion of them are not squares. Not only so, but the proportionate number of squares diminishes as we pass to larger numbers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He resolves the contradiction by denying the possibility of comparing infinite numbers (and of comparing infinite and finite numbers): 
&lt;blockquote&gt;We can only infer that the totality of all numbers is infinite, that the number of squares is infinite, and that the number of their roots is infinite; neither is the number of squares less than the totality of all numbers, nor the latter greater than the former; and finally the attributes "equal," greater," and "less," are not applicable to infinite, but only to finite, quantities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This conclusion, that ascribing sizes to infinite sets should be ruled impossible, owing to the contradictory results obtained from these two ostensibly natural ways of attempting to do so, is a resolution to the problem that is consistent with, but less powerful than, the methods used in modern mathematics. The resolution to the problem may be generalized by considering Galileo's first definition of what it means for sets to have equal sizes, that is, the ability to put them in one-to-one correspondence. This turns out to yield a way of comparing the sizes of infinite sets that is free from contradictory results.

These issues of infinity arise from problems of rolling circles. If two concentric circles of different radii roll along lines, then if the larger does not slip it appears clear that the smaller must slip. But in what way? Galileo attempts to clarify the matter by considering hexagons and then extending to rolling 100 000-gons, or n-gons, where he shows that a finite number of finite slips occur on the inner shape. Eventually, he concludes "the line traversed by the larger circle consists then of an infinite number of points which completely fill it; while that which is traced by the smaller circle consists of an infinite number of points which leave empty spaces and only partly fill the line," which would not be considered satisfactory now.

==Reactions by commentators==
::"So great a contribution to physics was ''Two New Sciences'' that scholars have long maintained that the book anticipated [[Isaac Newton's laws of motion]]." --[[Stephen Hawking]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Hawking]], ed. p. 397, ''On the Shoulders of Giants''.&lt;/ref&gt;

::"Galileo ... is the father of modern [[physics]]—indeed of modern [[science]]"—[[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Hawking]], ed. p. 398, ''On the Shoulders of Giants''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of ''Two New Sciences'' was pure mathematics, as has been pointed out by the mathematician [[Alfréd Rényi]], who argued that it was the most significant book on mathematics in over 2000 years: Greek mathematics did not deal with motion, and so they never formulated mathematical laws of motion, even though Archimedes developed differentiation and integration. ''Two New Sciences'' opened the way to treating physics mathematically by treating motion mathematically for the first time. The Greek mathematician [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] had designed his paradoxes to prove that motion could not be treated mathematically, and that any attempt to do so would lead to paradoxes. (He regarded this as an inevitable limitation of mathematics.) Aristotle reinforced this belief, saying that mathematic could only deal with abstract objects that were immutable. Galileo used the very methods of the Greeks to show that motion could indeed be treated mathematically. His idea was to separate out the paradoxes of the infinite from Zeno's paradoxes. He did this in several steps. First, he showed that the infinite sequence S of the squares 1, 4, 9, 16, ...contained as many elements as the sequence N of all positive integers. See the [[Two New Sciences#Infinity|Infinity]] section.This is now referred to as [[Galileo's paradox]]. Then, using Greek style geometry, he showed a short line interval contained as many points as a longer interval. At some point he formulates the general principle that a smaller infinite set can have just as many points as a larger infinite set containing it. It was then clear that Zeno's paradoxes on motion resulted entirely from this paradoxical behavior of infinite quantities. Having removed this 2000-year-old stumbling block, Galileo went on to introduce his mathematical laws of motion, anticipating Newton.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Renyi, ''Dialogs on Mathematics'', Holden-Day, San Francisco, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gassendi's thoughts===
[[Pierre Gassendi]] defended Galileo's opinions in his book, ''De Motu Impresso a Motore Translato''. In Howard Jones' article, ''Gassendi's Defence of Galileo: The Politics of Discretion'', Jones says Gassendi displayed an understanding of Galileo's arguments and a clear grasp of their implications for the physical objections to the earth's motion.

===Koyré's thoughts===
The [[law of falling bodies]] was published by Galileo in 1638. But in the 20th century some authorities challenged the reality of Galileo's experiments. In particular, the French [[History of science and technology|historian of science]] [[Alexandre Koyré]] bases his doubt on the fact that the experiments reported in ''Two New Sciences'' to determine the law of acceleration of falling bodies, required accurate measurements of time which appeared to be impossible with the technology of 1600. According to Koyré, the law was created deductively, and the experiments were merely illustrative [[thought experiment]]s. In fact, Galileo's water clock (described above) provided sufficiently accurate measurements of time to confirm his conjectures.

Later research, however, has validated the experiments. The experiments on falling bodies (actually rolling balls) were replicated using the methods described by Galileo,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|title=An experiment in the history of science|first=Thomas B.|last=Settle|year=1961|journal=Science|volume=133|issue=3445|pages=19–23|doi=10.1126/science.133.3445.19|pmid=17759858|bibcode=1961Sci...133...19S }}
&lt;/ref&gt; and the precision of the results was consistent with Galileo's report. Later research into Galileo's unpublished working papers from 1604 clearly showed the reality of the experiments and even indicated the particular results that led to the time-squared law.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25286">'''Universal algebra''' (sometimes called '''general algebra''') is the field of [[mathematics]] that studies [[algebraic structure]]s themselves, not examples ("models") of algebraic structures.
For instance, rather than take particular groups as the object of study, in universal algebra one takes the class of groups as an object of study.

==Basic idea==
In universal algebra, an '''algebra''' (or '''algebraic [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]]''') is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' together with a collection of operations on ''A''.  An '''''n''-[[arity|ary]] [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]''' on ''A'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that takes ''n'' elements of ''A'' and returns a single element of ''A''.  Thus, a 0-ary operation (or ''nullary operation'') can be represented simply as an element of ''A'', or a ''[[Constant (mathematics)|constant]]'', often denoted by a letter like ''a''.  A 1-ary operation (or ''[[unary operation]]'') is simply a function from ''A'' to ''A'', often denoted by a symbol placed in front of its argument, like ~''x''.  A 2-ary operation (or ''[[binary operation]]'') is often denoted by a symbol placed between its arguments, like ''x''&amp;nbsp;∗&amp;nbsp;''y''.  Operations of higher or unspecified ''[[arity]]'' are usually denoted by function symbols, with the arguments placed in parentheses and separated by commas, like ''f''(''x'',''y'',''z'') or ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).  Some researchers allow [[infinitary]] operations, such as &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\bigwedge_{\alpha\in J} x_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; where ''J'' is an infinite [[index set]], thus leading into the algebraic theory of [[complete lattice]]s.  One way of talking about an algebra, then, is by referring to it as an [[Outline of algebraic structures#Types of algebraic structures|algebra of a certain type]] &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is an ordered sequence of natural numbers representing the arity of the operations of the algebra.

It is also possible to define an algebra via the [[Finitary relation|relations]] in the algebra instead of the operations. [[Variety (universal algebra)#Birkhoff's theorem|Birkhoff's Theorem]] states that the two definitions are equivalent, i.e., there is a [[Galois connection]] between relational and operational structures. This connection can be easily illustrated on the case of [[lattice (order)|lattices]], where the algebraic structure can be given by the operations [[join (mathematics)|join]] and [[join and meet|meet]] or by introducing a [[Partially ordered set|partial order]] relation. The relational point of view is useful in computational problems, in particular for the [[constraint satisfaction problem]] (CSP).

===Equations===
After the operations have been specified, the nature of the algebra is further defined by [[axiom]]s, which in universal algebra often take the form of [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]], or '''equational laws.'''    An example is the [[associative]] axiom for a binary operation, which is given by the equation ''x''&amp;nbsp;∗&amp;nbsp;(''y''&amp;nbsp;∗&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;= (''x''&amp;nbsp;∗&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;∗&amp;nbsp;''z''.  The axiom is intended to hold for all elements ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' of the set ''A''.

==Varieties==
{{Main|Variety (universal algebra)}}

A collection of algebraic structures defined by identities is called a [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]] or '''equational class'''. Some authors consider varieties to be the main focus of universal algebra.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Restricting one's study to varieties rules out:

* [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]], including  [[universal quantification]] (&lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;), except before an equation, and [[existential quantification]] (&lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt;)
** [[Predicate logic]] in particular is ruled out 
* All [[Finitary relation|relations]] except equality, in particular [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]], both {{nowrap|''a'' ≠ ''b''}} and [[Order theory|order relations]]

The study of equational classes can be seen as a special branch of [[model theory]], typically dealing with structures having operations only (i.e. the [[signature (logic)|type]] can have symbols for functions but not for [[Finitary relation|relations]] other than equality), and in which the language used to talk about these structures uses equations only.

Not all [[algebraic structure]]s in a wider sense fall into this scope. For example, [[ordered group]]s involve an ordering relation, so would not fall within this scope.

The class of [[field (mathematics)|field]]s is not an equational class because there is no type (or "signature") in which all field laws can be written as equations (inverses of elements are defined for all ''non-zero'' elements in a field, so inversion cannot be added to the type).

One advantage of this restriction is that the structures studied in universal algebra can be defined in any [[category theory|category]] that has ''finite [[product (category theory)|product]]s''. For example, a [[topological group]] is just a group in the category of [[topological space]]s.

===Examples===
Most of the usual algebraic systems of mathematics are examples of varieties, but not always in an obvious way&amp;nbsp;– the usual definitions often involve quantification or inequalities.

====Groups====
To see how this works, let's consider the definition of a [[group (mathematics)|group]].  Normally a group is defined in terms of a single binary operation ∗, subject to these axioms:

* [[associative|Associativity]] (as in the [[#Equations|previous section]]):  ''x''&amp;nbsp;∗&amp;nbsp;(''y''&amp;nbsp;∗&amp;nbsp;''z'')&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; (''x''&amp;nbsp;∗&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;∗&amp;nbsp;''z''; &amp;nbsp; formally: ∀''x'',''y'',''z''. ''x''∗(''y''∗''z'')=(''x''∗''y'')∗''z''.
* [[Identity element]]:  There exists an element ''e'' such that for each element ''x'', ''e''&amp;nbsp;∗&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; ''x''&amp;nbsp;∗&amp;nbsp;''e''; &amp;nbsp; formally: ∃''e'' ∀''x''. ''e''∗''x''=''x''=''x''∗''e''.
* [[Inverse element]]:  It can easily be seen that the identity element is unique. If this unique identity element is denoted by ''e'' then for each ''x'', there exists an element ''i'' such that ''x''&amp;nbsp;∗&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; ''e''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp; ''i''&amp;nbsp;∗&amp;nbsp;''x''; &amp;nbsp; formally: ∀''x'' ∃''i''. ''x''∗''i''=''e''=''i''∗''x''.

(Some authors also use an axiom called "[[Closure (mathematics)|closure]]", stating that ''x''&amp;nbsp;∗&amp;nbsp;''y'' belongs to the set ''A'' whenever ''x'' and ''y'' do.  But from a universal algebraist's point of view, that is already implied by calling ∗ a binary operation.)

This definition of a group is problematic from the point of view of universal algebra.  The reason is that the axioms of the identity element and inversion are not stated purely in terms of equational laws but also have clauses involving the phrase "there exists ... such that ...".  This is inconvenient; the list of group properties can be simplified to universally quantified equations by adding a nullary operation ''e'' and a unary operation ~ in addition to the binary operation ∗. Then list the axioms for these three operations as follows:

* Associativity:  {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∗ (''y'' ∗ ''z'') &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;}} {{nowrap|(''x'' ∗ ''y'') ∗ ''z''}}.
* Identity element:  {{nowrap|1=''e'' ∗ ''x'' &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;}} {{nowrap|1=''x'' &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;}} {{nowrap|''x'' ∗ ''e''}}; formally: ∀''x''. ''e''∗''x''=''x''=''x''∗''e''.
* Inverse element:  {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∗ (~''x'') &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;}} {{nowrap|1=''e'' &amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;}} {{nowrap|(~''x'') ∗ ''x''}} &amp;nbsp; formally: ∀''x''. ''x''∗~''x''=''e''=~''x''∗''x''.
(Of course, we usually write "''x''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;" instead of "~''x''", which shows that the notation for operations of low [[arity]] is not ''always'' as given in the second paragraph.)

What has changed is that in the usual definition there are:

* a single binary operation ([[signature (logic)|signature]] (2))
* 1 equational law (associativity)
* 2 quantified laws (identity and inverse)
...while in the universal algebra definition there are
* 3 operations: one binary, one unary, and one nullary ([[signature (logic)|signature]] (2,1,0))
* 3 equational laws (associativity, identity, and inverse)
* no quantified laws (except for outermost universal quantifiers which are allowed in varieties)

It is important to check that this really does capture the definition of a group.  The reason that it might not is that specifying one of these universal groups might give more information than specifying one of the usual kind of group.  After all, nothing in the usual definition said that the identity element ''e'' was ''unique''; if there is another identity element ''e''', then it is ambiguous which one should be the value of the nullary operator ''e''.  Proving that it is unique is a common beginning exercise in classical group theory textbooks.  The same thing is true of [[inverse element]]s.  So, the universal algebraist's definition of a group is equivalent to the usual definition.

At first glance this is simply a technical difference, replacing quantified laws with equational laws. However, it has immediate practical consequences – when defining a [[group object]] in category theory, where the object in question may not be a set, one must use equational laws (which make sense in general categories), and cannot use quantified laws (which do not make sense, as objects in general categories do not have elements). Further, the perspective of universal algebra insists not only that the inverse and identity exist, but that they be maps in the category. The basic example is a [[topological group]] – not only must the inverse exist element-wise, but the inverse map must be continuous (some authors also require the identity map to be a [[closed inclusion]], hence [[cofibration]], again referring to properties of the map).

====Other examples====
Most algebraic structures are examples of universal algebras.

* [[Ring (mathematics)|Rings]], [[semigroup]]s, [[quasigroup]]s, [[groupoid]]s, [[Magma (mathematics)|magmas]], [[Loop (algebra)|loops]], and others.
* [[Vector space]]s or [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over a fixed field or rings are universal algebras. The operations, in this case, are addition and, for each element of the field or ring, scalar multiplication by this element.

Examples of relational algebras include [[semilattice]]s, [[lattice (order)|lattices]] or [[Boolean algebra]]s.

==Basic constructions==
We assume that the type, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, has been fixed.  Then there are three basic constructions in universal algebra: homomorphic image, subalgebra, and product.

A [[homomorphism]] between two algebras ''A'' and ''B'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''h'': ''A''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''B'' from the set A to the set B such that, for every operation ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; of A and corresponding ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; of B (of arity, say, ''n''), ''h''(''f''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;))&amp;nbsp;= ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;(''h''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;),...,''h''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)).  (Sometimes the subscripts on ''f'' are taken off when it is clear from context which algebra the function is from.) For example, if ''e'' is a constant (nullary operation), then ''h''(''e''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''e''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;.  If ~ is a unary operation, then ''h''(~''x'')&amp;nbsp;= ~''h''(''x'').  If ∗ is a binary operation, then ''h''(''x''&amp;nbsp;∗&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;= ''h''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;∗&amp;nbsp;''h''(''y'').  And so on.  A few of the things that can be done with homomorphisms, as well as definitions of certain special kinds of homomorphisms, are listed under the entry [[Homomorphism]].  In particular, we can take the homomorphic image of an algebra, ''h''(''A'').

A subalgebra of ''A'' is a subset of ''A'' that is closed under all the operations of ''A''.  A product of some set of algebraic structures is the [[cartesian product]] of the sets with the operations defined coordinatewise.

* [[Variety (universal algebra)#Birkhoff's theorem|Birkhoff's HSP Theorem]], which states that a class of algebras is a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] if and only if it is closed under homomorphic images, subalgebras, and arbitrary direct products.

==Motivations and applications==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}

In addition to its unifying approach, universal algebra also gives deep theorems and important examples and counterexamples. It provides a useful framework for those who intend to start the study of new classes of algebras.
It can enable the use of methods invented for some particular classes of algebras to other classes of algebras, by recasting the methods in terms of universal algebra (if possible), and then interpreting these as applied to other classes. It has also provided conceptual clarification; as J.D.H. Smith puts it, ''"What looks messy and complicated in a particular framework may turn out to be simple and obvious in the proper general one."''

In particular, universal algebra can be applied to the study of [[monoid]]s, [[ring (algebra)|rings]], and [[lattice (order)|lattice]]s.  Before universal algebra came along, many theorems (most notably the [[isomorphism theorem]]s) were proved separately in all of these classes, but with universal algebra, they can be proven once and for all for every kind of algebraic system.

The 1956 paper by Higgins referenced below has been well followed up for its framework for a range of particular algebraic systems, while his 1963 paper is notable for its discussion of algebras with operations which are only partially defined, typical examples for this being categories and groupoids. This leads on to the subject of [[higher-dimensional algebra]] which can be defined as the study of algebraic theories with partial operations whose domains are defined under geometric conditions. Notable examples of these are various forms of higher-dimensional categories and groupoids.

===Constraint satisfaction problem===
{{Main|Constraint satisfaction problem}}

Universal algebra provides a natural language for the [[constraint satisfaction problem|constraint satisfaction problem (CSP)]]. CSP refers to an important class of computational problems where, given a relational algebra {{mvar|A}} and an existential [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]] &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; over this algebra, the question is to find out whether &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; can be satisfied in {{mvar|A}}. The algebra {{mvar|A}} is often fixed, so that {{math|CSP&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;}} refers to the problem whose instance is only the existential sentence &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

It is proved that every computational problem can be formulated as {{math|CSP&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for some algebra {{mvar|A}}.

For example, the [[graph coloring|''n''-coloring]] problem can be stated as CSP of the algebra &lt;math&gt;\big(\{0,1,\dots,n-1\}, \neq\big)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. an algebra with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; elements and a single relation, inequality.

The dichotomy conjecture (proved in April 2017) states that if {{mvar|A}} is a finite algebra, then {{math|CSP&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is either [[P (complexity)|P]] or [[NP-completeness|NP-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv | last = Zhuk | first = Dmitriy | title = The Proof of CSP Dichotomy Conjecture | eprint = 1704.01914 | date = 2017 | class = cs.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==
{{Further|Category theory|Operad theory|Partial algebra|Model theory}}

Universal algebra has also been studied using the techniques of [[category theory]].  In this approach, instead of writing a list of operations and equations obeyed by those operations, one can describe an algebraic structure using categories of a special sort, known as [[Lawvere theory|Lawvere theories]] or more generally [[algebraic theory|algebraic theories]].  Alternatively, one can describe algebraic structures using [[monad (category theory)|monad]]s.  The two approaches are closely related, with each having their own advantages.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation|last1=Hyland|first1=Martin|last2=Power|first2=John|date=2007|title=The Category Theoretic Understanding of Universal Algebra: Lawvere Theories and Monads|url =http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~martin/Research/Publications/2007/hp07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In particularly, every Lawvere theory gives a monad on the category of sets, while any 'finitary' monad on the category of sets arises from a Lawvere theory.  However, a monad describes algebraic structures within one particular category (for example the category of sets), while algebraic theories describe structure within any of a large class of categories (namely those having finite [[product (category theory)|products]]).

A more recent development in category theory is [[operad theory]]&amp;nbsp;– an operad is a set of operations, similar to a universal algebra, but restricted in that equations are only allowed between expressions with the variables, with no duplication or omission of variables allowed.  Thus, rings can be described as the so-called 'algebras' of some operad, but not groups, since the law &lt;math&gt;g g^{-1} = 1&lt;/math&gt; duplicates the variable ''g'' on the left side and omits it on the right side.  At first this may seem to be a troublesome restriction, but the payoff is that operads have certain advantages: for example, one can hybridize the concepts of ring and vector space to obtain the concept of [[associative algebra]], but one cannot form a similar hybrid of the concepts of group and vector space.

Another development is [[partial algebra]] where the operators can be [[partial function]]s.  Certain partial functions can also be handled by a generalization of Lawvere theories known as [[essentially algebraic theory|essentially algebraic theories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=essentially+algebraic+theory|title=Essentially algebraic theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another generalization of universal algebra is [[model theory]], which is sometimes described as "universal algebra + logic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn=0444880542 | author=C.C. Chang and H. Jerome Keisler | title=Model Theory | publisher=North Holland | series=Studies in Logic and the Foundation of Mathematics | volume=73 | edition=3rd | year=1990 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s book ''A Treatise on Universal Algebra,'' published in 1898, the term ''universal algebra'' had essentially the same meaning that it has today. Whitehead credits [[William Rowan Hamilton]] and [[Augustus De Morgan]] as originators of the subject matter, and [[James Joseph Sylvester]] with coining the term itself.&lt;ref name="Gratzer.1968"&gt;{{cite book | author=George Grätzer | editor=M.H. Stone and L. Nirenberg and S.S. Chern | title=Universal Algebra | location= | publisher=Van Nostrand Co., Inc | edition=1st | year=1968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|v}}

At the time structures such as [[Lie algebra]]s and [[hyperbolic quaternion]]s drew attention to the need to expand algebraic structures beyond the associatively multiplicative class. In a review [[Alexander Macfarlane]] wrote: "The main idea of the work is not unification of the several methods, nor generalization of ordinary algebra so as to include them, but rather the comparative study of their several structures."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Macfarlane]] (1899) [https://ia601900.us.archive.org/14/items/jstor-1626993/1626993.pdf Review:''A Treatise on Universal Algebra'' (pdf)], [[Science (journal)|Science]] 9: 324–8 via [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; At the time [[George Boole]]'s algebra of logic made a strong counterpoint to ordinary number algebra, so the term "universal" served to calm strained sensibilities.

Whitehead's early work sought to unify [[quaternions]] (due to Hamilton), [[Grassmann]]'s [[Exterior algebra#History|Ausdehnungslehre]], and Boole's algebra of logic.  Whitehead wrote in his book:
:''"Such algebras have an intrinsic value for separate detailed study; also they are worthy of comparative study, for the sake of the light thereby thrown on the general theory of symbolic reasoning, and on algebraic symbolism in particular. The comparative study necessarily presupposes some previous separate study, comparison being impossible without knowledge."''&lt;ref name="Gratzer.1968"/&gt;

Whitehead, however, had no results of a general nature. Work on the subject was minimal until the early 1930s, when [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[Øystein Ore]] began publishing on universal algebras.  Developments in [[metamathematics]] and [[category theory]] in the 1940s and 1950s furthered the field, particularly the work of [[Abraham Robinson]], [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Andrzej Mostowski]], and their students (Brainerd 1967).

In the period between 1935 and 1950, most papers were written along the lines suggested by Birkhoff's papers, dealing with [[Free object|free algebras]], congruence and subalgebra lattices, and homomorphism theorems. Although the development of mathematical logic had made applications to algebra possible, they came about slowly; results published by [[Anatoly Maltsev]] in the 1940s went unnoticed because of the war. Tarski's lecture at the 1950 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Cambridge ushered in a new period in which model-theoretic aspects were developed, mainly by Tarski himself, as well as C.C. Chang, [[Leon Henkin]], [[Bjarni Jónsson]], [[Roger Lyndon]], and others.

In the late 1950s, [[Edward Marczewski]]&lt;ref&gt;Marczewski, E. "A general scheme of the notions of independence in mathematics." Bull. Acad. Polon. Sci. Ser. Sci. Math. Astronom. Phys. '''6''' (1958), 731–736.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized the importance of free algebras, leading to the publication of more than 50 papers on the algebraic theory of free algebras by Marczewski himself, together with [[Jan Mycielski]], Władysław Narkiewicz, Witold Nitka, J. Płonka, S. Świerczkowski, [[Kazimierz Urbanik|K. Urbanik]], and others.

Starting with [[William Lawvere]]'s thesis in 1963, techniques from category theory have become important in universal algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Lawvere|first1=William F.|authorlink=William Lawvere|date=1964|title=Functorial Semantics of Algebraic Theories (PhD Thesis)|url = http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/5/tr5abs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
