      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37820">'''AICPA Statements of Position''' (SOPs), available full-text at the links below from the [[University of Mississippi]]'s Library Digital Collections with the permission of the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA), have been issued by the AICPA's Accounting Standards Division since 1974 and are meant to influence the development of [[accounting]] standards and to propose revisions to the AICPA's Audit and Accounting Guide (AAGs) series.&lt;ref&gt;''Statements of Position of the Accounting Standards Division as of January 1, 1978.''American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''AICPA Technical Practice Aids as of June 1, 2008.'' American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Those SOPs dealing with accounting standards are superseded by the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board|FASB's]] [http://asc.fasb.org Accounting Standards Codification].

Audit and Attest SOPs were issued to revise or supplement the AICPA's Audit and Accounting Guides, provide implementation guidance for specific types of audit and attest engagements, and guidance in specialized areas of audit and attest.  These SOPs have the same authority as the AAGs.

The full-text in the list below links to reproductions of SOPs as originally issued.  Revisions, deletions, and status changes are recorded in the annual AICPA publication ''Technical Practice Aids'' which began in 1977.

My parents had a lot of books around the house. My mum was a consumer of literature…I had read a lot and upon leaving secondary school, I knew I wanted to do literature, entertainment and all that...All though my stay in university I was always writing, so it was natural that I continued when I left.. Eventually, I got a chance to write for Encomium and within a month or two, they gave me the music column to handle."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Why I chose to be a journalist without formal training' -NET newspaper publisher, Ayeni Adekunle |url=http://encomium.ng/classics-why-i-chose-to-be-a-journalist-without-formal-training-net-newspaper-publisher-ayeni-adekunle/ |date=28 February 2012 |newspaper=Encomium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Working for Encomium I knew I wasn't going to be there for too long, I had always wanted to do my own stuff, but needed to gain some experience working for others. But because I wanted to also taste the other side of the print media, I joined Thisday newspaper and finally, The Punch. It was after that that I felt it was time for me to start my own newspaper."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thenetng/BHM Founder, 'Ayeni The Great' Speaks To Pulse |url=http://pulse.ng/gist/thenetng-bhm-founder-ayeni-the-great-speaks-to-pulse-com-ng-id2505357.html |date=27 November 2014 |website=Pulse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adekunle Ayeni founded [[Black House Media]] in 2006 for public relations services. In 2012, he led a team of software and content developers in [Nigeria] to unveil the BHM App, which is the "first PR mobile application" in Nigeria. The application has been described as "a complete resource centre for the entire media and marketing communications industries especially for the clients seeking information about PR agencies in the country." It took Ayeni and his team one year to develop the BHM App. Ayeni, in an interview he held with Raheem Akingbolu of [[ThisDay]] newspapers, said that the BHM App development was informed by "the crave for best practice. It is high time the Public Relations industry in Nigeria kept the world abreast about its stories and the great things happening in the market. It is our belief that Agencies' database, news hub, social PR, news and tips and workshop videos that would be on this application will help marketing practitioners, including journalists to be more accurate and informed." The application was unveiled at an event graced by industry experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ayeni Adekunle's BHM Launches Nigeria's First PR App |url=http://www.sabinews.com/all-news/ayeni-adekunle-bhm-launches-nigerias-first-pr-app/ |author=Editor |date=5 August 2014 |newspaper=SabiNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ayeni: PR is About the Truth Well Told |url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/ayeni-pr-is-about-the-truth-well-told/190335/ |author=Raheem Akingbolu |date=2 October 2014 |newspaper=ThisDay |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123534/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/ayeni-pr-is-about-the-truth-well-told/190335/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trending Market |url=http://brandsmart.com.ng/news/trending-markets/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150309095946/http://brandsmart.com.ng/news/trending-markets/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-03-09 |newspaper=BrandsMart }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayeni posited that "there is nothing like Digital PR…What we need to focus on, and talk about is Today's PR and Today's online communities. Today's PR is about story telling, about content.

'''Alfred Victor Philadelphe du Pont de Nemours''' (April 11, 1798 &amp;ndash; October 4, 1856) was [[French American]] [[chemist]] and [[industrialist]], who was the eldest son and successor of [[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont]], the founder of the [[DuPont|E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]].

==Early life and family==
{{main|Du Pont family}}
Du Pont was born in [[Paris]], son of [[Éleuthère Irénée du Pont]] and Sophie Madeleine Dalmas du Pont. He came to the United States in 1800 as an infant and grew up around the gunpowder mills founded by his father on the [[Brandywine Creek (Christina River)|Brandywine Creek]] in [[Delaware]]. Later he attended Mount Airy College, in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]], [[Pennsylvania]] and then studied chemistry at [[Dickinson College]]. While there he was president of ''Belles Lettres Literary Society'' and became a friend of one of his professors, [[Thomas Cooper (US politician)|Thomas Cooper]]. He later became Cooper's  assistant at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  Du Pont married American Margaretta Elizabeth "Molly" La Motte (or Lammot) in 1824; they had seven children.

==E.I. du Pont Company==
In 1818, du Pont returned home to help his father rebuild the gunpowder company after a disastrous explosion that killed 33 people and injured his mother. He worked closely with the men in the mills and was particularly interested in researching new gunpowder chemical developments. The laboratory was his home. However, after spending nearly 20 years as a "powderman," and after a reorganization of the partnership by James Antoine Bidermann, he became head of the company in 1837. It was a difficult role for him, and after leading the company through a recovery from a disastrous mill explosion in 1847, he retired in poor health in 1850.

==Death and legacy==
Alfred du Pont died October 4, 1856 at Eleutherian Mills, near [[Greenville, Delaware|Greenville]], [[Delaware]], and is buried in the du Pont de Nemours Cemetery near Greenville.

His son, Alfred Victor du Pont, would become a founding father of [[Phi Kappa Sigma]] in 1850.

That same year, he co-established the International Soft switch Consortium (ISC) and developed the first mobile soft switch system in the world and the first carrier-class streaming media exchange and IPTV system.&lt;ref name="labs"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://labs.chinamobile.com/members/info_7|title=中国移动研究院|accessdate=31 August 2017|work=labs.chinamobile.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political campaigns==
===1986 campaign for Mayor===
Gurley announced his candidacy for [[mayor of the District of Columbia]] in 1986.&lt;ref name= anacostia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Sandra. "Wilson Says He Probably Will Not Run for Mayor". ''The Washington Post''. April 9, 1986. p. B1.&lt;/ref&gt; Unemployed and living in [[Anacostia]], Gurley ran as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate, challenging [[Marion Barry]]'s reelection.&lt;ref name= anacostia/&gt; Gurley said he was running for office so that a lifelong District resident would be in charge of the District's government.&lt;ref name= anacostia/&gt; Gurley advocated for improvements to the District's prison system and housing department, and he said that Mayor Barry's leadership was "decaying".&lt;ref name= anacostia/&gt;

The District of Columbia Office of Business and Economic Development opened a neighborhood revitalization office in Anacostia, in order to give low-interest loans to small businesses for upgrades to the business' outside appearance.&lt;ref name= third&gt;Jackson, Kirk. "Third Neighborhood Revitalization Office Opens". ''Washington Informer''. May 21, 1986. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Gurley described the office as "a solution in search of a problem".&lt;ref name= third/&gt; Gurley said that businesses in Anacostia needed "money" and "technical assistance" rather than an governmental agency that did little more than "filling office space".&lt;ref name= third/&gt;

During a scheduled debate among the mayoral candidates, Gurley called for the [[death penalty]] for [[drug addiction|drug addicts]] who contribute to [[drug overdose]]s of other people.&lt;ref name= clash&gt;Brisbane, Arthur S. "Barry, Challengers Clash on issues at Forum". ''The Washington Post''. July 24, 1986. p. C5.&lt;/ref&gt; The audience loudly booed him for his statement.&lt;ref name= clash/&gt; Gurley later corrected himself, saying he meant to say he supported the death penalty for [[drug dealer]]s who contribute to drug overdoses.&lt;ref name= clash/&gt;

Gurley said that drug dealers should not be eligible for [[bail]] or [[parole]].&lt;ref name= notasingle&gt;Brisbane, Arthur S. "D.C. Mayoral Campaign Not a Single-Issue Race: Candidates Cite Drugs, Crime, Housing and Jobs". ''The Washington Post''. September 3, 1986. p.

"Foes Challenge Barry's Record On Housing and Rent Control". ''The Washington Post''. July 30, 1986. p. B7.&lt;/ref&gt; At another campaign stop, Gurley said that vacant houses should be renovated more quickly and that new housing developments should have more homes available for low- and middle-income residents.&lt;ref name= notasingle/&gt;

Gurley repeated his campaign theme of "anybody but Barry".&lt;ref name= accuse&gt;Brisbane, Arthur S. "Challengers Accuse Barry of Mismanagement: Mayor Defends Record, Says He Has Decreased Crime, Improved Employment". ''The Washington Post''. August 20, 1986. p. C3.&lt;/ref&gt; Gurley criticized Barry for sending [[Marion C. Barry|his son]] to a private school.&lt;ref name= accuse/&gt; Gurley noted that public schooling was suitable for [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]]'s [[Amy Carter|daughter]] but not for Barry's son.&lt;ref name= accuse/&gt; Gurley suggested that Barry would increase funding for public schools if his own son were attending them.&lt;ref name= accuse/&gt; Gurley said he would voluntarily take a [[drug test]] and challenged Barry to do the same.&lt;ref name= notasingle/&gt;

Gurley said the most serious problem facing the District was that federal authorities had taken control of certain functions of the [[government of the District of Columbia]] due to mismanagement, resulting in what Gurley called "the loss of [[District of Columbia home rule|home rule]]".&lt;ref name= vg1986&gt;"District of Columbia Voters' Guide". ''The Washington Post''. September 4, 1986. p. VG2.&lt;/ref&gt; Gurley said that the District had not improved at all during the previous four years, with the exception of [[downtown, Washington, D.C.|downtown]].&lt;ref name= vg1986/&gt;

At a meeting of the District of Columbia Ward 6 Democrats, the group decided to endorse Barry for reelection.&lt;ref name= ward6dems&gt;Brisbane, Arthur S. "Barry Wins Endorsement: Foes Decry 'Staged Event' in D.C. Ward 6". ''The Washington Post''. August 6, 1986. p.

Barry won the primary election with 71 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Brisbane, Arthur S. "Barry Gains Landslide In District: Clarke, Nathanson Win, Spaulding Loses In Voting for Council".

At a debate held in March, Gurley advocated for a publicly funded military school for youths in order to prevent drug use.&lt;ref name= marchdebate&gt;Melton, R. H. "Democratic Hopefuls Debate Without Barry". ''The Washington Post''. March 22, 1990. p. D1.&lt;/ref&gt; In Gurley's words, the District should "grab these kids off the street from mothers who don't care" and enroll them at the military academy.&lt;ref name= marchdebate/&gt;

In May, Gurley was interviewed about his mayoral campaign on [[WHUT-TV|WHUT]]'s "Evening Exchange".&lt;ref&gt;Carmody, John. "The TV Column". ''The Washington Post''. May 15, 1990. p. C6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gurley continued to support the establishment of a public military school for youth in the District. Gurley wanted police officers to walk the streets in order to stop individuals from [[loitering]].&lt;ref name= vg1990/&gt;  Gurley wanted to make sure taxis would serve the neighborhood of Anacostia so that people doing neighborhood patrols could teach children instead.&lt;ref name= vg1990/&gt; Gurley wanted the District to use property confiscated in drug arrests to be used to fund drug education and prevention, additional pay for police officers, and youth-recreation projects.&lt;ref name= vg1990/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6207">'''Carbonatation''' is a [[chemical reaction]] in which [[calcium hydroxide]] reacts with [[carbon dioxide]] and forms insoluble [[calcium carbonate]]:

:Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;rarr; CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The process of forming a carbonate is sometimes referred to as "[[carbonation]]", although this term usually refers to the process of dissolving carbon dioxide in water.

==Concrete==
[[File:Betonrot Hippodroom.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Carbonatation induced rebar corrosion]]
Carbonatation is a slow process that occurs in [[concrete]] where [[Lime (material)|lime]] ([[Calcium oxide|CaO]], or [[Calcium hydroxide|Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]&lt;sub&gt;([[Aqueous solution|au]])&lt;/sub&gt;) in the [[cement]] reacts with [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the [[air]] and forms calcium carbonate.

The water in the pores of Portland cement concrete is normally [[alkaline]] with a [[pH]] in the range of 12.5 to 13.5. This highly alkaline environment is one in which the steel [[rebar]] is passivated and is protected from corrosion. According to the [[Pourbaix diagram]] for iron, the metal is passive when the pH is above 9.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.corrosion-doctors.org/Thermo/ironE-pH.htm |title=Pourbaix diagram of iron |publisher=Corrosion-doctors.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The carbon dioxide in the air reacts with the [[alkali]] in the cement and makes the pore water more acidic, thus lowering the pH. Carbon dioxide will start to carbonatate the cement in the concrete from the moment the object is made. This carbonatation process will start at the surface, then slowly move deeper and deeper into the concrete. The rate of carbonatation is dependent on the relative humidity of the concrete - a 50% relative humidity being optimal. If the object is cracked, the carbon dioxide in the air will be better able to penetrate into the concrete.

Eventually this may lead to corrosion of the rebar and structural damage or failure.

==Sugar refining==
The carbonatation process is used in the production of [[sugar]] from [[sugar beet]]s. 
It involves the introduction of [[limewater]] (milk of lime - [[calcium hydroxide]] [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]) and carbon dioxide enriched gas into the "raw juice" (the sugar rich liquid prepared from the diffusion stage of the process) to form calcium carbonate and precipitate impurities that are then removed. The whole process takes place in "carbonatation tanks" and processing time varies from 20 minutes to an hour.

Carbonatation involves the following effects: 
* The increase in [[alkalinity]] [[coagulation|coagulates]] [[protein]]s in the juice.
* Calcium carbonate absorbs colourants
* Alkalinity destroys some [[monosaccharide]] sugars, mostly [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]

The target is a large particle that naturally settles rapidly to leave a clear juice. The juice at the end is approximately 15 [[Brix|°Bx]] and 90% [[sucrose]]. The [[pH]] of the thin juice produced is a balance between removing as much [[calcium]] from the solution and the expected pH drop across later processing. If the juice goes [[acid]]ic in the [[crystallization|crystallisation]] stages then sucrose rapidly breaks down to [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]; not only do glucose and fructose affect crystallisation but they are ''[[molasses|molassagenic]]'' taking equivalent amounts of sucrose on to the molasses stage.

The carbon dioxide gas bubbled through the mixture forms calcium carbonate. The non-sugar solids are incorporated into the calcium carbonate particles and removed by natural (or assisted) [[sedimentation]] in tanks.

There are several systems of carbonatation, named from the companies that first developed them. They differ in how the lime is introduced, the temperature and duration of each stage, and the separation of the solids from the liquid. 
* [[John V. N. Dorr|Dorr]] (also [[Dorr-Oliver]]) - a continuous process using two tanks with recycling ("1st carbonatation") to build up particle size for natural [[flocculation]]. The recycling ratio is about 7:1. The particles are separated under gravity in a thickening stage in a vessel called a [[clarifier]]. The clear juice is then gassed further in another tank ("2nd carbonatation") and filtered. The concentrated mud (underflow) from the clarifier is filtered and/or pressed to recover more liquid. The Dorr process is low in maintenance and man-power but susceptible to filtration problems when frost damaged beets are processed. It is favoured in the UK and the USA.
* DDS (''Det Danske Sukkerfabrik'' - "The Danish Sugarfactory") -- multistage process involving pre-liming where the [[pH]] of the juice is gradually increased to start precipitation of proteins, followed by addition of further lime and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas. The particles are removed at each stage by filtration.
* RT (''Raffinerie Tirlemontoise'' - "[[Sugar refinery of Tienen]]") - another multistage process with a pre-liming stage. Particles also removed by filtration.

Both DDS and RT processes are favoured by [[Europe]]an factories. The carbonatation system is generally matched to the [[Sugar beet#Diffusion|diffusion scheme]]; juice from RT diffusers being processed by the RT carbonatation.

The clear juice from carbonatation is generally known as "thin juice". it may undergo pH adjustment with [[soda ash]] and addition of [[sulfur]] ("sulfitation") prior to the next stage which is concentration by multiple effect evaporation.

==Water softening==
The carbonatation reaction takes place during [[lime softening]] (Clark's process) in [[water softening]].

In the United Kingdom, a '''competent person''' is designated by a company to ensure that the company's [[Health-and-safety|health and safety]] responsibilities are being met.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/competence/what-is-competence.htm|title=What is Competence? - Competence in health and safety|website=www.hse.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a legal obligation required of the company, to ensure that the business understands, and can act on, the health and safety risks that might occur during their particular type of work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Recognition of competence is defined as requiring "sufficient training and experience or knowledge and other qualities" to be able to effectively oversee health and safety in the business,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/3242/regulation/7/made|title=The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; although specialised industries may have additional, more specific requirements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3249">The '''Credit Managers' Index''' '''(CMI)''' is a monthly economic indicator of financial activity reflecting credit managers' responses to levels of favorable and unfavorable factors. The measure has been sourced in stories from publications such as the ''Wall Street Journal'', ''CFO'' and ''Bloomberg''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ww2.cfo.com/credit/2015/09/credit-managers-index-continues-decline/|title=Credit Managers' Index Continues to Decline -|last=Kuehner-Hebert|first=Katie|date=2015-09-30|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-11-01/economy-looking-up-ahead-of-big-jobs-number|title=Economy Looking Up Ahead of Big Jobs Number|last=Coy|first=Peter|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2007/10/01/woes-dont-extend-to-credit-managers/|title=Woes Don’t Extend to Credit Managers|last=WSJ|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tracked since February 2002, the CMI is produced by the [[National Association of Credit Management]] (NACM)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nacm.org/cmi.html|title=Credit Managers' Index (CMI)|website=nacm.org|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently conducted by Armada Corporate Intelligence's Chris Kuehl, who also serves as NACM's economic advisor. The CMI is compiled through a voluntary poll of credit and finance professionals in the service and manufacturing sectors. The CMI results generally are released on the last business day of each month.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.nacm.org/CMI/PDF/CMIcurrent.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A CMI number of more than 50 indicates an economy in expansion; less than 50 indicates contraction.

Unlike many economic indexes, the CMI resisted the month-to-month swings during the most recent{{when?|date=October 2017}} economic downturn. The index accurately signaled that the economic plunge was stabilizing and beginning to recover from the recession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nacmnc.org/news/news.asp?id=271241|title=Simple Act, Huge Impact - NACM North Central|website=www.nacmnc.org|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chartered Institute of Credit Management (CICM) in the UK produces a similar Index&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cicm.com/credit-management-index/|title=CICM UK Credit Management Index - Chartered Institute of Credit Management|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a quarterly basis reflecting its members' responses to questions about the same factors and it uses the same methodology.

==Methodology==
The index is based on survey responses of approximately 1,000 trade credit managers in the second half of each month. There is typically an approximately equal representation between the manufacturing and service sectors. Respondents from throughout the United States are asked to comment on whether they are seeing improvement, deterioration, or no change for various favorable and unfavorable factors.

The computation of seasonality is based on the formula used by the U.S. Census Bureau and most of the federal government's statistical gathering apparatus. This is designed to streamline comparisons between the CMI diffusion index and comparable indices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4992">'''Eugene Lawrence "Gene" Case''' (December 6, 1937 &amp;ndash; September 9, 2010) was an American [[advertising]] executive who developed campaigns for Mennen [[Skin Bracer]] and [[Tums]], and developed ads for political campaigns for [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]] campaign, as well as for [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and [[Robert F. Wagner]]. Case was a founder of the firm Jordan McGrath Case &amp; Partners.

Case was born on December 6, 1937, in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], where his father worked for the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]. The success his father had in the [[New Deal]] helped shape Case's liberal philosophy, saying "''I saw government lift [my home] region out of Appalachian-style poverty".&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Todd. [http://adage.com/article?article_id=145864 "Gene Case, 72, Dies of Heart Attack"], ''[[Advertising Age]]'', September 13, 2010. Accessed September 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;'' He earned his undergraduate degree from [[Cornell University]], where he majored in architecture and was a member of the [[Quill and Dagger]] society. He entered the advertising field in 1961, when he took a position as a copywriter at the [[J. Walter Thompson]] agency.&lt;ref name=NYTObit&gt;Weber, Bruce. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/business/media/14case.html "Gene Case, Who Marketed After-Shave and Politicians, Dies at 72"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 13, 2010. Accessed September 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

While with [[DDB Worldwide|Doyle Dane Bernbach]], Case worked with [[Tony Schwartz (sound archivist)|Tony Schwartz]] as part of the team that developed the "[[Daisy (advertisement)|Daisy ad]]" for Johnson's 1964 campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Robert. [https://books.google.com/books?id=7PlUY5YSp_sC&amp;pg=PA57 ''Daisy Petals and Mushroom Clouds: LBJ, Barry Goldwater, and the Ad that Changed American Politics''], p. 57,  [[Louisiana State University Press]], 2011. {{ISBN|080714293X}}. Accessed December 4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Depicting a girl counting petals plucked from a daisy, the voiceover changes to a countdown that ends with the mushroom cloud of a nuclear explosion. Case wrote the copy for another Johnson ad in which a man who says he had always been a Republican speaks to the camera for four minutes about his fear of [[Barry Goldwater]] being elected. Case worked for [[Nelson Rockefeller]]'s successful bid for a third term as [[Governor of New York]] in the [[New York state election, 1966|1966 elections]] where he produced ads on pollution control, and he later worked on [[New York City]] mayoral bids by [[Robert F. Wagner]] and [[Bella Abzug]].&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt;

Case founded Jordan McGrath Case &amp; Partners with [[Helmut Krone]] in 1969, operating out of a suite at the [[Plaza Hotel]], with Pat McGrath joining shortly thereafter. A $500,000 campaign they nabbed that year for [[Angostura bitters]] was the agency's first commercial account.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-58826834.html "30 YEARS OF JORDAN, MCGRATH"], ''[[Advertising Age]]'', May 24, 1999. Accessed September 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; There he developed the "Thanks. I needed that." campaign for Mennen's Skin Bracer aftershave and the ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''-inspired "tum-ta-tum-tum" for [[Tums]] antacid. At its peak in the 1990s the firm had 350 employees and $500 million in annual billings. He and his partners sold Jordan McGrath to the [[France|French]] advertising firm [[Havas]] in 1999.&lt;ref name=NYT1999/&gt;

Case established the advocacy ad group Avenging Angels in 2002, creating ads for liberal causes such as those that supported a ban on assault weapons, opposed the war in Iraq, sought to stem nuclear proliferation and for the [[Hudson River]] advocacy group [[Riverkeeper]]. He told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that he was glad that he had made the shift back to issue advertising, saying "I've never been so productive, so happy — and so poor."&lt;ref name=NYTObit/&gt; Anti-Iraq War ads that Case had developed featuring [[Janeane Garofalo]] and [[Susan Sarandon]] in February 2003 were rejected by the major U.S. broadcast networks which said that they don't accept advocacy ads.&lt;ref name=NYT1999&gt;Lauro, Patricia Winters.

Accessed September 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Case died in [[Manhattan]] at age 72 on September 9, 2010, due to a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. He was survived by his third wife and their daughter, a daughter and two sons from his first marriage, a son from his second marriage and nine grandchildren.

'''Globalization''' [[-ise vs -ize|or]] '''[[wiktionary:globalisation#English|globalisation]]''' is the process  of [[foreign relations|interaction]] and integration between people, companies, and governments [[world]]wide. Globalization has grown due to advances in [[transportation]] and [[communication]] technology. With increased global interactions comes the growth of international [[trade]], [[idea]]s, and [[culture]]. Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration that's associated with social and cultural aspects. However, [[wiktionary:conflict|conflicts]] and [[diplomacy]] are also large parts of the [[history of globalization]], and modern globalization.

Economically, globalization involves goods and services, and the economic resources of capital, technology, and data.&lt;ref name="Albrow"&gt;Albrow, Martin and Elizabeth King (eds.) (1990). ''Globalization, Knowledge and Society'' London: Sage. {{ISBN|9780803983236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlbrowKing1990"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Martin |last1=Albrow|first2=Elizabeth |last2=King|title=Globalization, knowledge, and society: readings from International sociology|url={{google books|id=lfe1AAAAIAAJ|plainurl=yes}}|year=1990|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=978-0-8039-8323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALso, with the expansions of global markets liberalize the economic
activities of exchange of goods and funds. Removal of Cross-Border Trades barriers has made formation of
Global Markets more feasible. [https://ijbssnet.com/journals/Vol_2_No_23_Special_Issue_December_2011/36.pdf.

==Etymology and usage==
The term ''globalization'' derives from the word ''globalize'', which refers to the emergence of an international network of economic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=globalization|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest known usages of the term as a noun was in a 1930 publication entitled ''Towards New Education'', where it denoted a holistic view of human experience in education.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50297775?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Globalization&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|date=September 2009|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'globalization' had been used in its economic sense at least as early as 1981, and in other senses since at least as early as 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/business/06levitt.html | title=Theodore Levitt, 81, Who Coined the Term 'Globalization', Is Dead | date=6 July 2006 | accessdate=23 April 2014 | author=Feder, Barnaby J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore Levitt is credited with popularizing the term and bringing it into the mainstream business audience in the later half of the 1980s. Since its inception, the concept of globalization has inspired competing definitions and interpretations. Its antecedents date back to the great movements of trade and [[empire]] across [[Asia]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] from the 15th century onward.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G. (ed.). (2004). ''Globalization in World History.'' London: Norton, pp. 4–8. {{ISBN|978-0393979428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakari13"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakari|first=Mohamed El-Kamel|title=Globalization and Sustainable Development: False Twins?|journal=New Global Studies|volume=7|issue=3|pages=23–56|issn=1940-0004|doi=10.1515/ngs-2013-021|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the complexity of the concept, various research projects, articles, and discussions often stay focused on a single aspect of globalization.&lt;ref name="GCSP"&gt;Al-Rodhan, R.F. Nayef and Gérard Stoudmann. (2006). [http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf Definitions of the Globalization: A Comprehensive Overview and a Proposed Definition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119215401/http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] [[Martin Albrow]] and Elizabeth King define globalization as "all those processes by which the people of the world are incorporated into a single world society."&lt;ref name="Albrow" /&gt; In ''The Consequences of Modernity'', [[Anthony Giddens]] writes: "Globalization can thus be defined as the intensification of worldwide [[social relation]]s which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony. (1991). ''The Consequences of Modernity'' Cambridge: Polity Press. p. 64. {{ISBN|9780745609232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, [[Roland Robertson]], professor of sociology at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and an early writer in the field, described globalization as "the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization : social theory and global culture|last=Robertson|first=Roland|publisher=Sage|year=1992|isbn=0803981872|edition= Reprint.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Global Transformations'', [[David Held]] and his co-writers state:
{{quote|text=Although in its simplistic sense globalization refers to the widening, deepening and speeding up of global interconnection, such a definition begs further elaboration. ... Globalization can be on a continuum with the local, national and regional. At one end of the continuum lie social and economic relations and networks which are organized on a local and/or national basis; at the other end lie social and economic relations and networks which crystallize on the wider scale of regional and global interactions. Globalization can refer to those spatial-temporal processes of change which underpin a transformation in the organization of human affairs by linking together and expanding human activity across regions and continents. Without reference to such expansive spatial connections, there can be no clear or coherent formulation of this term. ... A satisfactory definition of globalization must capture each of these elements: extensity (stretching), intensity, velocity and impact.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David; Goldblatt, David; McGrew, Anthony; Perraton, Jonathan (1999). ''Global Transformations'' Cambridge: Polity Press. {{ISBN|9780745614984}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=|}}

Held and his co-writers' definition of globalization in that same book as "transformation in the spatial organization of social relations and transactions—assessed in terms of their extensity, intensity, velocity and impact—generating transcontinental or inter-regional flows" was called "probably the most widely-cited definition" in the 2014 [[Pankaj Ghemawat|DHL Global Connectiveness Index]].&lt;ref name="DHL"/&gt;

Swedish journalist Thomas Larsson, in his book ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'', states that globalization:
{{quote|is the process of world shrinkage, of distances getting shorter, things moving closer. It pertains to the increasing ease with which somebody on one side of the world can interact, to mutual benefit, with somebody on the other side of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Thomas. (2001). ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'' Washington, D.C.: Cato Institute. p. 9. {{ISBN|978-1930865150}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] defines globalization with a more direct and historically contextualized emphasis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Globalization is the extension of social relations across world-space, defining that world-space in terms of the historically variable ways that it has been practiced and socially understood through changing world-time.&lt;ref name=James2005&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2005 | last=James |first=Paul | title=  ‘Arguing Globalizations: Propositions Towards an Investigation of Global Formation’ | url= https://www.academia.edu/5246805/Arguing_Globalizations_Propositions_Towards_an_Investigation_of_Global_Formation | journal= Globalizations | volume= 2 | issue=  2 | pages=193–209 | doi=10.1080/14747730500202206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Manfred Steger]], professor of [[global studies]] and research leader in the [[Global Cities Institute]] at [[RMIT University]], identifies four main empirical [[dimensions of globalization]]: economic, political, cultural, and [[Ecology|ecological]]. A fifth dimension—the ideological—cutting across the other four. The ideological dimension, according to Steger, is filled with a range of [[Norm (social)|norms]], claims, beliefs, and narratives about the phenomenon itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last=Steger|first=Manfred|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955226-9|location=New York|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James and Steger stated that the concept of globalization "emerged from the intersection of four interrelated sets of '[[Community of practice|communities of practice]]' ([[Étienne Wenger|Wenger]], 1998): academics, journalists, publishers/editors, and librarians."&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt;{{Rp|424}} They note the term was used "in education to describe the global life of the mind"; in [[international relations]] to describe the extension of the [[European Economic Community|European Common Market]]; and in journalism to describe how the "American Negro and his problem are taking on a global significance".&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt; They have also argued that four different forms of globalization can be distinguished that complement and cut across the solely empirical dimensions.&lt;ref name=James2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=‘Levels of Subjective Globalization: Ideologies, Imaginaries, Ontologies’|url=https://www.academia.edu/4311113/Levels_of_Subjective_Globalization_Ideologies_Imaginaries_Ontologies|journal=Perspectives on Global Development and Technology|volume=12|issue=1–2|author1=Manfred B. Steger|author2=Paul James}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James, the oldest dominant form of globalization is embodied globalization, the movement of people. A second form is agency-extended globalization, the circulation of agents of different institutions, organizations, and [[Polity|polities]], including [[Imperialism|imperial]] agents. Object-extended globalization, a third form, is the movement of [[Commodity|commodities]] and other objects of exchange. He calls the transmission of ideas, images, knowledge, and information across world-space disembodied globalization, maintaining that it is currently the dominant form of globalization. James holds that this series of distinctions allows for an understanding of how, today, the most embodied forms of globalization such as the movement of [[refugee]]s and [[Immigration|migrants]] are increasingly restricted, while the most disembodied forms such as the circulation of financial instruments and codes are the most [[Deregulation|deregulated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2014|title=‘Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens’|url=https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens|journal=Citizenship Studies|volume=18|issue=2|pages=208–23|doi=10.1080/13621025.2014.886440|pmid=|access-date=|via=|last1=James|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalist [[Thomas L. Friedman]] popularized the term [[The World Is Flat|"flat world"]], arguing that [[Global trade|globalized trade]], [[outsourcing]], [[supply chain|supply-chaining]], and political forces had permanently changed the world, for better and worse. He asserted that the pace of globalization was quickening and that its impact on business organization and practice would continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas L. "The Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention". ''Emerging: A Reader.'' Ed. Barclay Barrios. Boston: Bedford, St. Martins, 2008. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] defined "economic globalization" as the opening and deregulation of [[Commodity market|commodity]], [[Capital market|capital]], and [[Labour economics|labor markets]] that led toward present [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] globalization. He used "political globalization" to refer to the emergence of a transnational [[élite]] and a phasing out of the [[nation-state]]. Meanwhile, he used "cultural globalization" to reference the worldwide homogenization of culture. Other of his usages included "[[Ideology|ideological]] globalization", "[[Technology|technological]] globalization", and "social globalization".&lt;ref&gt;Fotopoulos, Takis. (2001).

Lechner and Boli (2012) define globalization as more people across large distances becoming connected in more and different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner,  Frank J. and John Boli (eds.) (2011). ''The Globalization Reader.'' New Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Globophobia" is used to refer to the fear of globalization, though it can also mean the [[balloon phobia|fear of balloons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henwood|first1=Doug|title=Beyond Globophobia|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/beyond-globophobia|work=[[The Nation]]|date=1 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Ross|title=Globophobia|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/12049/globophobia-17/|work=[[The Spectator]]|date=20 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008"&gt;{{cite book|editor=George Ritzer|editorlink=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XKnmvRATtfAC|page=16}}|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of globalization}}
{{See also|Timeline of international trade}}

There are both [[Proximate and ultimate causation|distal and proximate causes]] which can be traced in the historical factors affecting globalization. Large-scale globalization began in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Rourke |first=Kevin H. |first2=Jeffrey G. |last2=Williamson |year=2002 |title=When Did Globalization Begin? |journal=European Review of Economic History |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=23–50 |doi=10.1017/S1361491602000023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaic===
[[File:Archaic globalization.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|The 13th century world-system, as described by [[Janet Abu-Lughod]]]]
{{Main|Archaic globalization}}

Archaic globalization conventionally refers to a phase in the history of globalization including globalizing events and developments from the time of the earliest [[civilization]]s until roughly the 1600s. This term is used to describe the relationships between communities and [[State (polity)|states]] and how they were created by the geographical spread of ideas and social norms at both local and regional levels.&lt;ref name="M 45"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this schema, three main prerequisites are posited for globalization to occur. The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how [[Western world|Western states]] have adapted and implemented learned principles from the [[Eastern world|East]].&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; Without the spread of traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions of states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and certain parts of Europe.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within a close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and thus another phase of globalization can occur. The third has to do with inter-dependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own [[Production (economics)|production]] and resources to work. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt;

Also posited is a "multi-polar" nature to archaic globalization, which involved the active participation of non-Europeans. Because it predated the [[Great Divergence]] of the nineteenth century, where [[Western Europe]] pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of [[industrial production]] and [[Output (economics)|economic output]], archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by Europe but also by other economically developed [[Old World]] centers such as [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]], coastal [[China]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Hans Köchler|Kochler]]|first=Hans|title=Globality versus Democracy: The Changing Nature of International Relations in the Era of Globalization|year=2000|publisher=International Progress Organization|location=Vienna|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NanbanCarrack.jpg|thumb|right|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], 17th-century Japanese [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]]]]

The German [[Economic history|historical economist]] and sociologist [[Andre Gunder Frank]] argues that a form of globalization began with the rise of trade links between [[Sumer]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in the third millennium [[Common Era|B.C.E.]]  This archaic globalization existed during the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Age]], when commercialized urban centers enveloped the axis of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture that reached from [[India]] to [[Spain]], including [[Alexandria]] and the other [[Alexander the Great|Alexandrine]] cities. Early on, the geographic position of Greece and the necessity of [[import]]ing wheat forced the Greeks to engage in maritime trade. Trade in ancient Greece was largely unrestricted: the state controlled only the supply of grain.&lt;ref name="GL-H-09"&gt;Frank, Andre Gunder. (1998). ''ReOrient: Global economy in the Asian age.''

Trade on the [[Silk Road]] was a significant factor in the development of civilizations from China, [[South Asian history|Indian subcontinent]], [[Persia]], Europe, and [[Arabia]], opening long-distance political and economic interactions between them.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China, common goods such as salt and sugar were traded as well; and [[religion]]s, [[syncretic]] philosophies, and various technologies, as well as [[disease]]s, also traveled along the Silk Routes. In addition to economic trade, the Silk Road served as a means of carrying out cultural trade among the civilizations along its network.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of people, such as refugees, artists, craftsmen, [[Missionary|missionaries]], robbers, and envoys, resulted in the exchange of religions, art, [[language]]s, and new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/legacy-silk-road | title = The Legacy of the Silk Road | publisher = Yale Global | date = 25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern===
{{Main|Proto-globalization}}

"[[Early modern period|Early modern]]-" or "proto-globalization" covers a period of the history of globalization roughly spanning the years between 1600 and 1800. The concept of "proto-globalization" was first introduced by [[historian]]s [[A. G. Hopkins]] and [[Christopher Bayly]]. The term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of high "modern globalization" in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G., ed., 2003. Globalization in World History. New York City, NY: Norton. {{ISBN|0-393-97942-3}} pp. 4–5, 7&lt;/ref&gt; This phase of globalization was characterized by the rise of maritime European empires, in the 16th and 17th centuries, first the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire]]s, and later the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[British Empire]]s. In the 17th century, world trade developed further when [[Chartered company|chartered companies]] like the [[British East India Company]] (founded in 1600) and the [[Dutch East India Company]] (founded in 1602, often described as the first [[multinational corporation]] in which [[stock]] was offered) were established.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, K.N. (1965\1999). ''The English East India Company: The Study of an Early Joint-stock Company 1600–1640 (Vol. 4).'' London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early modern globalization is distinguished from modern globalization on the basis of [[expansionism]], the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period is marked by such trade arrangements as the [[East India Company]], the shift of [[hegemony]] to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the rise of newfound commodities—most particularly [[slave trade]]. [[The Triangular Trade]] made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The transfer of animal stocks, plant crops, and epidemic diseases associated with [[Alfred W. Crosby]]'s concept of the [[Columbian Exchange]] also played a central role in this process. European, [[Muslim]], Indian, [[Southeast Asia]]n, and Chinese merchants were all involved in early modern trade and communications, particularly in the Indian Ocean region.

===Modern===
According to economic historians Kevin H. O'Rourke, Leandro Prados de la Escosura, and Guillaume Daudin, several factors promoted globalization in the period 1815-1870:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-economic-history-of-modern-europe/trade-and-empire/BE789F27408634F4749D61F013897C04|title=Trade and empire (Chapter 4) - The Cambridge Economic History of Modern Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Core|pages=100–101|language=en|access-date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars brought in an era of relative peace in Europe.
* Innovations in transportation technology reduced trade costs substantially.
* New industrial military technologies increased the power of European states and the United States, and allowed these powers to forcibly open up markets across the world and extend their empires.
* A gradual move towards greater liberalization in European countries.
During the 19th century, globalization approached its form as a direct result of the [[industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]]. [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]] allowed [[standardization|standardized]] production of household items using [[economies of scale]] while rapid [[population growth]] created sustained [[demand]] for commodities. In the 19th century, steamships reduced the cost of international transport significantly and [[railroads]] made inland transportation cheaper. The transport revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; More nations embraced [[international trade]].&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century [[imperialism]] such as in [[Scramble for Africa|Africa]] and [[Western imperialism in Asia|Asia]]. The invention of [[shipping container]]s in 1956 helped advance the globalization of commerce.&lt;ref name="Levinson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/how-the-invention-of-a-box-changed-our-world/2006/06/11/1149964409162.html%0A|title=How the invention of a box changed our world – Business – smh.com.au|last=Gittins|first=Ross|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], work by politicians led to the agreements of the [[Bretton Woods Conference]], in which major governments laid down the framework for [[International monetary systems|international monetary policy]], commerce, and finance, and the founding of several [[international institution]]s intended to facilitate economic growth by lowering [[trade barrier]]s. Initially, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) led to a series of agreements to remove trade restrictions. GATT's successor was the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), which provided a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and a dispute resolution process. Exports nearly doubled from 8.5% of total gross world product in 1970 to 16.2% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | title = World Exports as Percentage of Gross World Product | publisher=[[Global Policy Forum]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080712023541/http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | archivedate = 12 July 2008 | accessdate =11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of using global agreements to advance trade stumbled with the failure of the [[Doha Development Round]] of trade negotiation. Many countries then shifted to bilateral or smaller multilateral agreements, such as the 2011 [[South Korea–United States Free Trade Agreement]].

Since the 1970s, aviation has become increasingly affordable to [[middle class]]es in [[developed countries]]. [[Open skies]] policies and [[low-cost carrier]]s have helped to bring [[Competition (economics)|competition]] to the [[Market (economics)|market]]. In the 1990s, the growth of low-cost communication networks cut the cost of communicating between different countries. More work can be performed using a computer without regard to location. This included accounting, software development, and engineering design.

[[Student exchange program]]s became popular after [[World War II]], and are intended to increase the participants' understanding and tolerance of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their social horizons. Between 1963 and 2006 the number of students studying in a foreign country increased 9 times.&lt;ref name=varghese/&gt;

Economic globalization is the increasing economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in cross-[[border]] movement of goods, services, technology, and capital.&lt;ref name="Joshi, Rakesh Mohan 2009"&gt;Joshi, Rakesh Mohan, (2009) International Business, Oxford University Press, New Delhi and New York {{ISBN|0-19-568909-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as [[tariff]]s, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic globalization is the process of increasing [[economic integration]] between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, T: "Year 12 Economics", p. 9. Tim Riley Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises: Globalization of production; which refers to the obtention of goods and services from a particular source from different locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality. Likewise, it also comprises globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace.

Current globalization trends can be largely accounted for by developed economies integrating with less developed economies by means of [[foreign direct investment]], the reduction of trade barriers as well as other economic reforms, and, in many cases, [[immigration]]. more apparently, before the phase of Globalization, United States of America was a dominant country which held the essential economic power in world export.

If people are also free to move between the countries, in addition to a free-trade agreement, it would also be considered an [[open border]].

[[William I. Robinson]]'s theoretical approach to globalization is a critique of Wallerstein's World Systems Theory.  He believes that the global capital experienced today is due to a new and distinct form of globalization which began in the 1980s.  Robinson argues not only are economic activities expanded across national boundaries but also there is a transnational fragmentation of these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=William I.|title=Globalization and the sociology of Immanuel Wallerstein: A critical appraisal|journal=International Sociology|volume=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One important aspect of Robinson's globalization theory is that production of goods are increasingly global.  This means that one pair of shoes can be produced by six different countries, each contributing to a part of the production process.

{{Main|Cultural globalization}}

Cultural globalization refers to the transmission of ideas, meanings, and values around the world in such a way as to extend and intensify social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Paul|title=Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|url=https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet, [[popular culture]] media, and international travel. This has added to processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe. The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders. The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level. Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities. It brings increasing interconnectedness among different populations and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred B. Steger and Paul James, ‘Ideologies of Globalism’, in Paul James and Manfred B. Steger, eds, [https://uws.academia.edu/PaulJames Globalization and Culture: Vol. 4, Ideologies of Globalism], Sage Publications, London, 2010.  {{Cite book|title=The Anthropology of Globalization|last1=Inda|first1=Jonathan|last2=Rosaldo|first2=Renato|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2002|chapter=Introduction: A World in Motion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cross-cultural communication]] is a field of study that looks at how people from differing cultural backgrounds communicate, in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeavour to communicate across cultures. [[Intercultural communication]] is a related field of study.

[[Cultural diffusion]] is the spread of [[culture|cultural]] items—such as [[idea]]s, [[fashion|styles]], [[religion]]s, [[technology|technologies]], [[contact linguistics|languages]] etc.
Cultural globalization has increased cross-cultural contacts, but may be accompanied by a decrease in the uniqueness of once-isolated communities. For example, [[sushi]] is available in Germany as well as Japan, but [[Disneyland Paris|Euro-Disney]] outdraws the city of Paris, potentially reducing demand for "authentic" French pastry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v25n3/globalization.pdf |title=Globalization and Culture |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |last2=Barber |first2=Benjamin |journal=Cato Policy Report |date=May–June 2003 |accessdate=15 March 2017|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, S (2009) [http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf Macaulay's (Cyber) Children: The Cultural Politics of Outsourcing in India].

Globalization has expanded recreational opportunities by spreading pop culture, particularly via the Internet and satellite television.

Religions were among the earliest cultural elements to globalize, being spread by force, migration, [[evangelism|evangelists]], imperialists, and traders. [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and more recently sects such as [[Mormonism]] are among those religions which have taken root and influenced endemic cultures in places far from their origins.&lt;ref&gt;McAlister, Elizabeth. 2005.

The term globalization implies transformation. Cultural practices including traditional music can be lost or turned into a fusion of traditions. Globalization can trigger a state of emergency for the preservation of musical heritage. Archivists may attempt to collect, record, or transcribe repertoires before melodies are assimilated or modified, while local musicians may struggle for [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] and to preserve local musical traditions. Globalization can lead performers to discard traditional instruments. Fusion genres can become interesting fields of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Thomas. 2004.

Music has an important role in economic and cultural development during globalization. Music genres such as [[jazz]] and [[reggae]] began locally and later became international phenomena. Globalization gave support to the [[world music]] phenomenon by allowing music from developing countries to reach broader audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. (2002.)

[[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] claimed that the perception of consumption can be seen as self-identification and the formation of identity. Musically, this translates into each individual having their own musical identity based on likes and tastes. These likes and tastes are greatly influenced by culture, as this is the most basic cause for a person's wants and behavior. The concept of one's own culture is now in a period of change due to globalization. Also, globalization has increased the interdependency of political, personal, cultural, and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, David and Keneth Gloag. 2005. Musicology: The Key Concepts.

A 2005 [[UNESCO]] report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/template/pdf/cscl/IntlFlows_EN.pdf |title=International Flows of Selected Goods and Services |format=PDF |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that cultural exchange is becoming more frequent from Eastern Asia, but that Western countries are still the main exporters of cultural goods. In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US. Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the [[European Union]]'s shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America. Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries.

Some critics of globalization argue that it harms the diversity of cultures. As a dominating country's culture is introduced into a receiving country through globalization, it can become a threat to the diversity of local culture. Some argue that globalization may ultimately lead to [[Westernization]] or Americanization of culture, where the dominating cultural concepts of economically and politically powerful Western countries spread and cause harm to local cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aleteia.org/2018/04/11/why-do-we-need-religion-in-a-globalized-world/|title=Why do we need religion in a globalized world?|date=11 April 2018|work=Aleteia — Catholic Spirituality, Lifestyle, World News, and Culture|access-date=12 April 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization is a diverse phenomenon which relates to a multilateral political world and to the increase of cultural objects and markets between countries. The Indian experience particularly reveals the [[Cultural pluralism|plurality]] of the impact of cultural globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Biswajit (2011).

==Political globalization==
{{Main|Political globalization}}
[[File:67º Período de Sesiones de la Asamblea General de Naciones Unidas (8020913157).jpg|thumb|The [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations Headquarters]] in [[New York City]]]]

In general, globalization may ultimately reduce the importance of [[nation state]]s. [[Supranational]] institutions such as the [[European Union]], the [[WTO]], the [[G8]] or the [[International Criminal Court]] replace or extend national functions to facilitate international agreement.&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could ultimately lead to a [[global union]], based on the [[European Union]] model.&lt;ref name="mcclintock1"&gt;John McClintock (2010). "The Uniting of Nations: An Essay on Global Governance (3rd ed. revised and updated)". Publisher: P.I.E. Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intergovernmentalism]] is a term in [[political science]] with two meanings. The first refers to a theory of regional integration originally proposed by [[Stanley Hoffmann]]; the second treats states and the national government as the primary factors for integration.&lt;ref name="japss2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contribution of the Neofunctionalist and Intergovernmentalist Theories to the Evolution of the European Integration Process|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/14._Mogaarticle.pdf|publisher=Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Teodor Lucian Moga|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Multi-level governance]] is an approach in [[political science]] and [[public administration theory]] that originated from studies on [[European integration]]. Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy.  It illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority.

Some people are citizens of multiple nation-states. [[Multiple citizenship]], also called dual citizenship or multiple nationality or  dual nationality, is a person's [[citizenship]] status, in which a person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one [[Sovereign state|state]] under the laws of those states.

Increasingly, [[non-governmental organization]]s influence public policy across national boundaries, including [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian aid]] and [[International development|developmental efforts]].&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Philanthropic organizations with global missions are also coming to the forefront of humanitarian efforts; charities such as the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Accion International]], the Acumen Fund (now [[Acumen Fund|Acumen]]) and the [[Echoing Green]] have combined the [[business model]] with [[philanthropy]], giving rise to business organizations such as the [[Global Philanthropy Group]] and new associations of philanthropists such as the [[Global Philanthropy Forum]].  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation projects include a current multibillion-dollar commitment to funding immunizations in some of the world's more impoverished but rapidly growing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Vaccine-Delivery|title=Vaccine Delivery|work=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hudson Institute]] estimates total private philanthropic flows to developing countries at [[US$]]59 billion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/2012IndexofGlobalPhilanthropyandRemittances.pdf ''The Index of Global Philanthropy and Remittances 2012''.

As a response to globalization, some countries have embraced [[isolationism|isolationist]] policies. For example, the [[North Korea]]n government makes it very difficult for foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do. Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions the government does not wish them to enter. Citizens cannot freely leave the country.&lt;ref name=nkr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northkoreanrefugees.com/2008-exodus.htm |title=North Korean Refugees NGO |publisher=Northkoreanrefugees.com |date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unhcr&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,PRK,4562d8cf2,487ca236c0,0.html |title=UNHCR Freedom in the World 2008 – North Korea |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018022844/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CPRK%2C4562d8cf2%2C487ca236c0%2C0.html |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other dimensions==
Scholars also occasionally discuss other, less common dimensions of globalization, such as [[environmental globalization]] (the internationally coordinated practices and regulations, often in the form of international treaties, regarding environmental protection)&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"&gt;{{cite book|first=Karl S. |last=Zimmerer|title=Globalization &amp; New Geographies of Conservation|url={{google books|id=UdLK-UGj7YkC|page=1|plainurl=yes}}|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-98344-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[military globalization]] (growth in global extent and scope of security relationships).&lt;ref name="Krishnan2016"&gt;{{cite book|first=Armin |last=Krishnan|title=War as Business: Technological Change and Military Service Contracting|url={{google books|id=1ymrCwAAQBAJ|page=PA157|plainurl=yes}}|date=3 March 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-00049-5|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those dimensions, however, receive much less attention the three described above, as academic literature commonly subdivides globalization into three major areas: [[economic globalization]], [[cultural globalization]] and [[political globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"/&gt;

===Movement of people===
[[File:World-airline-routemap-2009.png|thumb|Scheduled [[airline]] traffic in 2009]]
An essential aspect of globalization is movement of people, and state-boundary limits on that movement have changed across history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2014 | last1= James| first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens | url= https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens | journal= Citizenship Studies | volume=  18 | issue=  2 | pages= 208–23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of tourists and business people opened up over the last century. As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. For example, travel across the [[Atlantic ocean]] used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Boustan, Adain May . "Fertility and Immigration." UCLA. 15 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, modern aviation has made long-distance transportation quick and affordable.

[[Tourism]] is travel for pleasure. The developments in technology and transport infrastructure, such as [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jets]], [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], and more [[accessible tourism|accessible]] [[airport]]s have made many types of tourism more affordable. International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012.&lt;ref name="Barom2012"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |title=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]] |journal=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |date=January 2013 |volume=11 |issue=1 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228162347/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Travel visa|visa]] is a conditional authorization granted by a country to a foreigner, allowing them to enter and temporarily remain within, or to leave that country. Some countries – such as those in the [[Schengen Area]] – have agreements with other countries allowing each other's citizens to travel between them without visas. The [[World Tourism Organization]] announced that the number of tourists who require a visa before traveling was at its lowest level ever in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/travel/visa-requirements-for-tourism-eased-around-the-world-says-un-agency-365446391.html Visa requirements for tourism eased around the world, says UN agency]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |title=Visa Openness Report 2015 January 2016 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123123959/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |archivedate=23 January 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immigration]] is the international movement of people into a destination [[country]] of which they are not natives or where they do not possess [[citizenship]] in order to settle or reside there, especially as [[Permanent residency|permanent residents]] or [[Naturalization|naturalized]] citizens, or to take-up [[employment]] as a [[migrant worker]] or temporarily as a [[foreign worker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/immigration|title=immigration|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immigration| title=immigrate|publisher=Merriam-Webster, In.|website=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCUK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's who: Definitions|url=http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/policy_research/the_truth_about_asylum/the_facts_about_asylum|first=|last=|publisher=Refugee Council|location=London, England|year=2016|access-date= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[International Labour Organization]], {{as of|2014|lc=y}} there were an estimated 232 million international migrants in the world (defined as persons outside their country of origin for 12 months or more) and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mainstreaming of Migration in Development Policy and Integrating Migration in the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/genericdocument/wcms_220084.pdf|website=www.ilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; International movement of labor is often seen as important to economic development. For example, [[freedom of movement for workers in the European Union]] means that people can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country.

''[[Financial Times]]''. 1 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Globalization is associated with a dramatic rise in [[international education]].  More and more students are seeking higher education in foreign countries and many [[international student]]s now consider overseas study a stepping-stone to permanent residency within a country.&lt;ref name="gribble"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gribble | first1 = C | year = 2008 | title = Policy options for managing international student migration: the sending country's perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 25–39 | doi=10.1080/13600800701457830}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contributions that [[foreign student]]s make to host nation economies, both culturally and financially has encouraged major players to implement further initiatives to facilitate the arrival and integration of overseas students, including substantial amendments to [[immigration]] and visa policies and procedures.&lt;ref name="varghese"&gt;Varghese, N.V. 2008, 'Globalization of higher education and cross-border student mobility', International Institute for Educational Planning, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[transnational marriage]] is a [[marriage]] between two people from different countries. A variety of special issues arise in marriages between people from different countries, including those related to [[citizenship]] and culture, which add complexity and challenges to these kinds of relationships.
In an age of increasing globalization, where a growing number of people have ties to networks of people and places across the globe, rather than to a current geographic location, people are increasingly marrying across national boundaries. Transnational marriage is a by-product of the movement and migration of people.

===Movement of information===
{{See also|Internet}}
{{Internet users by region}}
Before electronic communications, long-distance communications relied on [[mail]]. Speed of global communications was limited by the maximum speed of courier services (especially horses and ships) until the mid-19th century. The [[electric telegraph]] was the first method of instant long-distance communication. For example, before the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took weeks because ships had to carry mail across the ocean. The first [[transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Lasting transatlantic telegraph connections were achieved in the 1865–1866. The first wireless telegraphy transmitters were developed in 1895.

The [[Internet]] has been instrumental in connecting people across geographical boundaries. For example, [[Facebook]] is a [[social networking service]] which has more than [[List of virtual communities with more than 100 million active users|1.65 billion monthly active users]] {{as of|2016|3|31|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="Facebook-Newsroom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Info – Facebook Newsroom|url=https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/|publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization can be spread by Global journalism which provides massive information and relies on the internet to interact,  "makes it into an everyday routine to investigate how people and their actions, practices, problems, life conditions etc. in different parts of the world are interrelated. possible to assume that global threats such as climate change precipitate the further establishment of global journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Berglez |date=2008 |title=WHAT IS GLOBAL JOURNALISM? |journal=Journalism Studies |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=845–858 &lt;!--was originally "5" but that's confusing--&gt; |doi=10.1080/14616700802337727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{See also|List of globalization-related indices}}

One index of globalization is the ''KOF Index of Globalization'', which measures three important dimensions of globalization:  economic, social, and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://globalization.kof.ethz.ch/ | title=KOF Index of Globalization | publisher=The KOF Swiss Economic Institute | work=ethz.ch | date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[A.T.

Measurements of economic globalization typically focus on variables such as [[trade]], [[Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI), [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), [[portfolio investment]], and [[income]].  However, newer indices attempt to measure globalization in more general terms, including variables related to political, social, cultural, and even environmental aspects of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vujakovic | first1 = Petra | year = 2010 | title = How to Measure Globalization?

==Support and criticism==
{{See also|Criticisms of globalization}}
Reactions to processes contributing to globalization have varied widely with a history as long as extraterritorial contact and trade. [[philosophy|Philosophical]] differences regarding the costs and benefits of such processes give rise to a broad-range of [[ideology|ideologies]] and [[social movements]].  Proponents of [[economic growth]], [[economic expansion|expansion]] and [[economic development|development]], in general, view globalizing processes as desirable or necessary to the well-being of human [[society]].&lt;ref name=Sen1970&gt;Sen, Amartya K. (1970).  ''Collective choice and social welfare.'' San Francisco, CA: Holden-Day.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antagonists view one or more globalizing processes as detrimental to social well-being on a global or local scale;&lt;ref name=Sen1970 /&gt; this includes those who social or [[natural environment|natural]] [[sustainability]] of long-term and continuous economic expansion, the social [[structural inequality]] caused by these processes, and the [[Colonialism|colonial]], [[Imperialism|imperialistic]], or [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[ethnocentrism]], [[cultural assimilation]] and [[cultural appropriation]] that underlie such processes.

Globalization tends to bring people into contact with foreign people and cultures. [[Xenophobia]] is the fear of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/xenophobia?q=xenophobia|title=Definition of xenophobia in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/xenophobia|title=Define Xenophobia at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and [[perception]]s of an [[ingroup]] towards an [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]], including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Guido Bolaffi. ''Dictionary of race, ethnicity and culture''. SAGE Publications Ltd., 2003. p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of globalization generally stem from discussions surrounding the impact of such processes on the planet as well as the human costs. They challenge directly traditional metrics, such as GDP, and look to other measures, such as the [[Gini coefficient]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20238991~menuPK:492138~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html|title=Poverty Analysis – Measuring Inequality|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Happy Planet Index]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.happyplanetindex.org/ |title=The Happy Planet Index |publisher=Neweconomics.org |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and point to a "multitude of interconnected fatal consequences–social disintegration, a breakdown of democracy, more rapid and extensive deterioration of the environment, the spread of new diseases, increasing poverty and alienation"&lt;ref name="The Hidden Connections"&gt;{{cite book | last = Capra | first = Fritjof | year = 2002 | title = The Hidden Connections | publisher=Random House | location = New York, New York | isbn = 0-385-49471-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they claim are the [[unintended consequences]] of globalization. Others point out that, while the forces of globalization have led to the spread of western-style democracy, this has been accompanied by an increase in inter-ethnic tension and violence as free market economic policies combine with democratic processes of universal suffrage as well as an escalation in militarization to impose democratic principles and as a means to conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Sorrells, Kathryn. Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion on globalization===

A 2005 study by Peer Fiss and Paul Hirsch found a large increase in articles negative towards globalization in the years prior. In 1998, negative articles outpaced positive articles by two to one.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"&gt;Fiss, Peer and Hirsch, Pal: "The Discourse of Globalization: Framing and Sensemaking of an Emerging Concept. American Sociological Review, February 2005. vol. 70 no 1: 29–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of newspaper articles showing negative framing rose from about 10% of the total in 1991 to 55% of the total in 1999. This increase occurred during a period when the total number of articles concerning globalization nearly doubled.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;

A number of international polls have shown that residents of Africa and Asia tend to view globalization more favorably than residents of Europe or North America. In Africa, a Gallup poll found that 70% of the population views globalization favorably.&lt;ref&gt;"Africans and Asians Tend to View Globalization Favorably. Europeans and Americans are More Skeptical". World Public Opinion.org. 7 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC found that 50% of people believed that economic globalization was proceeding too rapidly, while 35% believed it was proceeding too slowly.&lt;ref name=bbc08&gt;{{cite web| title = Widespread Unease about Economy and Globalization – Global poll| author = BBC World Service| date = 2008| accessdate = 24 March 2015| url = http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903173226/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| archivedate = 3 September 2014| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Philip Gordon stated that "a clear majority of Europeans believe that globalization can enrich their lives, while believing the European Union can help them take advantage of globalization's benefits while shielding them from its negative effects." The main opposition consisted of socialists, environmental groups, and nationalists. Residents of the EU did not appear to feel threatened by globalization in 2004. The EU job market was more stable and workers were less likely to accept wage/benefit cuts. Social spending was much higher than in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Philip. 2004. [http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace "Globalization: Europe's Wary Embrace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629191739/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace|date=29 June 2011}}.

Fiss, ''et al.'', surveyed US opinion in 1993. Their survey showed that, in 1993, more than 40% of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of globalization. When the survey was repeated in 1998, 89% of the respondents had a polarized view of globalization as being either good or bad. At the same time, discourse on globalization, which began in the financial community before shifting to a heated debate between proponents and disenchanted students and workers. Polarization increased dramatically after the establishment of the WTO in 1995; this event and subsequent protests led to a large-scale anti-globalization movement.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;
Initially, college educated workers were likely to support globalization. Less educated workers, who were more likely to compete with immigrants and workers in developing countries, tended to be opponents. The situation changed after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|financial crisis of 2007]]. According to a 1997 poll 58% of college graduates said globalization had been good for the US. By 2008 only 33% thought it was good. Respondents with high school education also became more opposed.&lt;ref name="ip08"&gt;Greg Ip: "The Declining Value Of Your College Degree", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. 17 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi, {{as of|1998|lc=y}} there was a perception in Japan that the economy was "Small and Frail". However, Japan was resource-poor and used exports to pay for its raw materials. Anxiety over their position caused terms such as ''[[internationalization]]'' and ''globalization'' to enter everyday language. However, Japanese tradition was to be as self-sufficient as possible, particularly in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi. 1998.

Many in developing countries see globalization as a positive force that lifts them out of poverty.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"/&gt; Those opposing globalization typically combine environmental concerns with nationalism.

In the book ''[[The End of Poverty]]'', Jeffrey Sachs discusses how many factors can affect a country's ability to enter the world market, including government [[Political corruption|corruption]]; legal and social disparities based on gender, ethnicity, or caste; diseases such as [[AIDS]] and [[malaria]]; lack of infrastructure (including transportation, communications, health, and trade); unstable political landscapes; [[protectionism]]; and geographic barriers.&lt;ref name="The End of Poverty"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sachs | first = Jeffrey | year = 2005 | title = The End of Poverty | publisher=The Penguin Press | location = New York, New York | isbn = 1-59420-045-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], a former adviser to the U.N. on globalization, holds that, although there are obvious problems with overly rapid development, globalization is a very positive force that lifts countries out of poverty by causing a virtuous economic cycle associated with faster economic growth.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bhagwati | first = Jagdish | title = In Defense of Globalization | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004 | location = Oxford, New York | url =| isbn =978-0195330939}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, economic growth does not necessarily mean a reduction in poverty; in fact, the two can coexist.

The flow of migrants to advanced economic countries has been claimed to provide a means through which global wages converge. An IMF study noted a potential for skills to be transferred back to developing countries as wages in those a countries rise.&lt;ref name="12th April 2000: IMF Publications"/&gt; Lastly, the dissemination of knowledge has been an integral aspect of globalization. Technological innovations (or technological transfer) is conjectured to benefit most the developing and least developing countries (LDCs), as for example in the adoption of [[mobile phones]].&lt;ref name="Saggi2002" /&gt;

There has been a rapid economic growth in Asia after embracing [[market orientation]]-based economic policies that encourage private [[property rights]], free enterprise and competition. In particular, in East Asian developing countries, [[GDP]] per head rose at 5.9% a year from 1975 to 2001 (according to 2003 [[Human Development Report]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2003|url= http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr03_complete.pdf|title=Human Development Report 2003|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of UNDP). Like this, the British economic journalist [[Martin Wolf]] says that incomes of poor developing countries, with more than half the world's population, grew substantially faster than those of the world's richest countries that remained relatively stable in its growth, leading to reduced international inequality and the incidence of poverty.

Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active [[economic liberalization]] and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality. According to Wolf, in the developing world as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in [[standards of living]] and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in [[fertility rate]] in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment.&lt;ref name="Wolf2004"&gt;{{cite book|url= http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|title= Why Globalization Works|publisher= [[Yale University Press]]|author= Martin Wolf|year= 2004|isbn= 978-0300102529|accessdate= 6 April 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130510120230/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|archivedate= 10 May 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of [[child labor]]. Thus, despite seemingly unequal [[distribution of income]] within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.

Per capita [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) growth among post-1980 globalizing countries accelerated from 1.4 percent a year in the 1960s and 2.9 percent a year in the 1970s to 3.5 percent in the 1980s and 5.0 percent in the 1990s. This acceleration in growth seems even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of 4.7 percent in the 1960s to 2.2 percent in the 1990s. Also, the non-globalizing developing countries seem to fare worse than the globalizers, with the former's annual growth rates falling from highs of 3.3 percent during the 1970s to only 1.4 percent during the 1990s. This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s—18 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial.&lt;ref name="DDollar"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dollar, David|author2=Kraay, Aart|title=Trade, Growth, and Poverty|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/09/dollar.htm|work=Finance and Development|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The globalization of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to the resurfacing of the idea that the growth of economic [[interdependence]] promotes peace.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite web |title=Globalisation promotes peace

Keynes had colourfully described the globalization before World War I in ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace'', Macmillan, 1919, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization allows corporations to [[outsource]] manufacturing and service jobs from high cost locations, creating economic opportunities with the most competitive wages and worker benefits.&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2008 39–72"/&gt; Critics of globalization say that it disadvantages poorer countries. While it is true that free trade encourages globalization among countries, some countries try to protect their domestic suppliers. The main export of poorer countries is usually [[agricultural production]]s. Larger countries often subsidize their [[Agricultural subsidy|farmers]] (e.g., the EU's [[Common Agricultural Policy]]), which lowers the market price for foreign crops.&lt;ref name="Hurst E.

===Global democracy===
{{Main|Democratic globalization}}

'''Democratic globalization''' is a movement towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]] that would give world citizens a say in political organizations. This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate oligopolies, ideological [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGO), political cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the British political thinker [[David Held]]. Advocates of [[democratic globalization]] argue that economic expansion and development should be the first phase of democratic globalization, which is to be followed by a phase of building [[International political economy|global political institutions]]. Dr. [[Francesco Stipo]], Director of the United States Association of the [[Club of Rome]], advocates unifying nations under a [[world government]], suggesting that it "should reflect the political and economic balances of world nations. A world confederation would not supersede the authority of the State governments but rather complement it, as both the States and the world authority would have power within their sphere of competence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacor.org/archive/index.html |title=USACOR.org |publisher=USACOR.org |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]] [[Douglas Roche]], [[Order of Canada|O.C.]], viewed globalization as inevitable and advocated creating institutions such as a [[direct election|directly elected]] [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] to exercise oversight over unelected international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roche|first=Douglas|title=The Case for a United Nations  Parliamentary Assembly|url=http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|publisher=The World Federalist Movement–Institute for Global Policy|accessdate=28 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531054746/http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|archivedate=31 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global civics===
{{Main|Global civics|Multiculturalism}}
{{See also|Global citizenship}}

Global civics suggests that [[civics]] can be understood, in a global sense, as a [[social contract]] between [[Global citizenship|global citizens]] in the age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altinay |first=Hakan |title=The Case for Global Civics |journal=Global Economy and Development at Brookings |year=2010 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603104201/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |archivedate=3 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World citizen]] has a variety of similar meanings, often referring to a person who disapproves of traditional [[geopolitical]] divisions derived from national [[citizenship]]. An early incarnation of this sentiment can be found in [[Socrates]], whom [[Plutarch]] quoted as saying: "I am not an Athenian, or a Greek, but a citizen of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcitizens.org.au|title=World Citizens Association Australia|work=World Citizens Association Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an increasingly interdependent world, world citizens need a compass to frame their mindsets and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility in world issues such as environmental problems and [[nuclear proliferation]].&lt;ref name = feasible&gt;{{cite journal | last = Altinay| first = Hakan| title= A Global Civics: Necessary?

Baha'i-inspired author Meyjes, while favoring the single world community and emergent global consciousness, warns of globalization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter = Language and Universalization: a ‘Linguistic Ecology’ Reading of Bahá’í Writ | first = Gregory Paul | last = Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes) | title = The Journal of Bahá’í Studies | publisher = Association for Bahá’í Studies | series = | volume =Volume IX (1) | year =1999 | location = Ottawa | pages = 51–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a cloak for an expeditious economic, social, and cultural Anglo-dominance that is insufficiently inclusive to inform the emergence of an optimal world civilization. He proposes a process of "[[Universalism#Non-religious Universalism|universalization]]" as an alternative.

[[Cosmopolitanism]] is the proposal that all human ethnic groups belong to a single [[community]] based on a shared [[morality]]. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a cosmopolitan or cosmopolite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmopolitan|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cosmopolitan?s=t|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive morality, a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations. The cosmopolitan community is one in which individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships based on mutual respect. For instance, [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, "Cosmopolitan Patriots," Critical Inquiry 23, no. 3 (Spring, 1997): 617–639.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian philosopher [[Marshall McLuhan]] popularized the term ''[[Global village (term)|Global Village]]'' beginning in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan and Bruce R. Powers (17 September 1992) The Global Village: Transformations in World Life and Media in the 21st century .

===International cooperation===
'''Military cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– Past examples of international cooperation exist. One example is the security cooperation between the United States and the former Soviet Union after the end of the Cold War, which astonished international society. Arms control and disarmament agreements, including the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (see [[START I]], [[START II]], [[START III]], and [[New START]]) and the establishment of [[NATO]]'s Partnership for Peace, the Russia NATO Council, and the [[G8]] Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, constitute concrete initiatives of arms control and de-nuclearization. The US–Russian cooperation was further strengthened by anti-terrorism agreements enacted in the wake of 9/11.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/brookings-audit/international-cooperation-stepping-stone-world-government |title=International cooperation as a stepping-stone to a world government &amp;#124; Global Policy Journal – Practitioner, Academic, Global Governance, International Law, Economics, Security, Institutions, Comment &amp; Opinion, Media, Events, Journal |publisher=Global Policy Journal |accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– One of the biggest successes of environmental cooperation has been the agreement to reduce chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions, as specified in the [[Montreal Protocol]], in order to stop ozone depletion. The most recent debate around nuclear energy and the non-alternative coal-burning power plants constitutes one more consensus on what not to do. Thirdly, significant achievements in IC can be observed through development studies.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"/&gt;

In ''The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy'', [[Christopher Lasch]] analyzes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-treachery-of-the-lites-elite-sense-of-irresponsibility-1610879.html |title=The treachery of the lites Elite sense of irresponsibility |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-03-10 |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the widening gap between the top and bottom of the social composition in the United States. For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to ''The revolt of the masses'' (1929) of the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset. According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations.
Globalization, according to the sociologist, has turned elites into tourists in their own countries. The de-nationalisation of business enterprise tends to produce a class who see themselves as "world citizens, but without accepting ... any of the obligations that citizenship in a polity normally implies". Their ties to an international culture of work, leisure, information – make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of  national decline. Instead of financing public services and the public treasury, new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos: private schools in their residential neighborhoods, private police, garbage collection systems. They have "withdrawn from common life".
Composed of those who control the international flows of capital and information, who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate. So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen. The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues. 
However, they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting loss of employment, the decline of the middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis.

D.A. Snow et al. contend that the [[anti-globalization movement]] is an example of a [[new social movement]], which uses tactics that are unique and use different resources than previously used before in other social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, D. A., Soule, S. A., &amp; Kriesi, H. (2004). The Blackwell companion to social movements. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most infamous tactics of the movement is the [[Battle of Seattle (1999)|Battle of Seattle]] in 1999, where there were protests against the World Trade Organization's Third Ministerial Meeting. All over the world, the movement has held protests outside meetings of institutions such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the World Economic Forum, and the Group of Eight (G8).&lt;ref name="stwr.org"/&gt; Within the Seattle demonstrations the protesters that participated used both creative and violent tactics to gain the attention towards the issue of globalization.

===Opposition to capital market integration===
{{Main|Anti-capitalist movements}}
[[File:Worldbank protest jakarta.jpg|thumb|World Bank Protester, [[Jakarta]], Indonesia]]

Capital markets have to do with raising and investing money in various human enterprises.  Increasing integration of these [[financial market]]s between countries leads to the emergence of a global capital marketplace or a single world market. In the long run, increased movement of capital between countries tends to favor owners of capital more than any other group; in the short run, owners and workers in specific sectors in capital-exporting countries bear much of the burden of adjusting to increased movement of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Invested Interests: The Politics of National Economic Policies in a World of  Global Finance|last=Frieden|first=Jeffry A.|journal=[[International Organization]]|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|issn=1531-5088|volume=45|issue=4|year=1991|pages=425–51|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033178|jstor=2706944|registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those opposed to capital market integration on the basis of [[human rights]] issues  are especially disturbed by the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by global and international institutions that, they say, promote [[neoliberalism]] without regard to ethical standards. Common targets include the [[World Bank]] (WB), [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and [[free trade]] treaties like the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI) and the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS). In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries, movement adherents claim free trade without measures in place to protect the under-capitalized will contribute only to the strengthening the power of industrialized nations (often termed the "North" in opposition to the developing world's "South").{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Anti-corporatism and anti-consumerism===
{{Main|Anti-corporatism|Anti-consumerism}}

[[Corporatism|Corporatist]] ideology, which privileges the rights of corporations ([[Legal personality|artificial or juridical persons]]) over those of [[natural person]]s, is an underlying factor in the recent rapid expansion of global commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2001/09/01/corporatism-goes-global | title=Corporatism Goes Global | author=Ottaway, Marina | journal=Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations | volume=7 | issue=3 | date=September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there have been an increasing number of books ([[Naomi Klein]]'s 2000 ''[[No Logo]]'', for example) and films (''e.g. [[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'' &amp; ''[[Surplus (film)|Surplus]]'') popularizing an [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] [[ideology]] to the public.

A related contemporary ideology, [[consumerism]], which encourages the personal acquisition of goods and services, also drives globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Lived effects of the Contemporary Economy: Globalization, Inequality, and Consumer Society. | author=Storper Michael | journal=Public Culture | year=2000 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=375–409 | doi=10.1215/08992363-12-2-375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-consumerism is a social movement against equating personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. Concern over the treatment of consumers by large corporations has spawned substantial activism, and the incorporation of [[consumer education]] into school [[curriculum|curricula]]. Social activists hold materialism is connected to [[Big-box store|global retail merchandizing]] and [[supplier convergence]], [[war]], greed, [[anomie]], [[crime]], environmental degradation, and general social [[malaise]] and discontent. One variation on this topic is activism by ''postconsumers'', with the strategic emphasis on moving ''beyond'' addictive consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Collective dissonance and the transition to post-consumerism | author=Cohen,  Maurie J. | journal=Futures |date=July 2013  | volume=52 | pages=42–51 | doi=10.1016/j.futures.2013.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global justice and inequality===

[[File:2014 Gini Index World Map, income inequality distribution by country per World Bank.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|Differences in national income equality around the world as measured by the national [[Gini coefficient]], 2014]]

The global justice movement is the loose collection of individuals and groups—often referred to as a "[[movement of movements]]"—who advocate [[fair trade]] rules and perceive current institutions of global economic integration as problems.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mertes, "A Movement of Movements", New York: Verso, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement is often labeled an anti-globalization movement by the mainstream media. Those involved, however, frequently deny that they are [[anti-globalization]], insisting that they support the globalization of communication and people and oppose only the global expansion of corporate power.&lt;ref&gt;della Porta, D. 2005. "The Social Bases of the Global Justice Movement: Some Theoretical Reflections and Empirical Evidence from the First European Social Forum." Civil Society and Social Movements Programme Paper No. 21.Geneva: UNRISD (United Nations Research Institute for Social Development).&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is based in the idea of [[social justice]], desiring the creation of a society or institution based on the principles of [[social equality|equality]] and [[solidarity]], the values of human rights, and the dignity of every human being.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Education and Social Justice By J.

Many nongovernmental organizations have now arisen to fight these inequalities that many in Latin America, Africa and Asia face. A few very popular and well known [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) include: [[War Child (charity)|War Child]], [[Red Cross]], [[Free The Children]] and [[CARE International]]. They often create partnerships where they work towards improving the lives of those who live in developing countries by building schools, fixing infrastructure, cleaning water supplies, purchasing equipment and supplies for hospitals, and other aid efforts.

====Social inequality====
{{Main|Social inequality|International inequality}}

The economies of the world have [[Development theory|developed]] unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis. From around 1980 through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly [[developing countries]], [[life expectancies]] began to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24835822 | title=How much do you know about the world? | publisher=BBC | date=2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Rosling, Hans| work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income, since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed—between Asia and the advanced economies of the West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally.  Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little. Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark. With a few exceptions—France, Japan, Spain—the top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead, while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/inequality-is-a-choice/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs | title=Inequality is a Choice | date=13 October 2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Stiglits Joseph E. | location=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2013, a tiny elite of multibillionaires, 85 to be exact, had amassed wealth equivalent to all the wealth owned by the poorest half (3.5 billion) of the world's total population of 7 billion.&lt;ref name="WEF2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC_GlobalAgendaOutlook_2014.pdf | title=Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of globalization argue that globalization results in weak [[trade union|labor unions]]: the surplus in cheap labor coupled with an ever-growing number of companies in transition weakened labor unions in high-cost areas. Unions become less effective and workers their enthusiasm for unions when membership begins to decline.&lt;ref name="Hurst E. Charles P.41"/&gt; They also cite an increase in the exploitation of [[child labour|child labor]]: countries with weak protections for children are vulnerable to infestation by rogue companies and criminal gangs who exploit them. Examples include [[quarry]]ing, salvage, and farm work as well as trafficking, bondage, forced labor, prostitution and pornography.&lt;ref name="Edmonds_Pavcni"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pavcnik | first = Nina |date=September 2005 | title = Child Labor in the Global Economy | journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–220 | doi = 10.1257/0895330053147895 | last2 = Pavcnik | first2 = Nina | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women often participate in the workforce in [[precarious work]], including [[export-oriented employment]].  Evidence suggests that while globalization has expanded women's access to employment, the long-term goal of transforming [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]] remains unmet and appears unattainable without regulation of capital and a reorientation and expansion of the state's role in funding public goods and providing a social safety net.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Seguino|first1=Stephanie|last2=Grown|first2=Caren|date=November 2006|title=Gender equity and globalization: macroeconomic policy for developing countries|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1081–104|doi=10.1002/jid.1295|ref=harv|author-link1=Stephanie Seguino|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.4614}} [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/Seguino_GrownGenderEquityandGlobalizationJID.pdf Pdf version – via the World Bank.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the intersectionality of gender, race, class, and more remain overlooked when assessing the impact of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, development, and globalization : economics as if all people mattered|last=Lourdes|first=Benería|others=Berik, Günseli,, Floro, Maria|isbn=9780415537483|edition= Second|location=New York|oclc=903247621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a study published by the IMF posited that [[neoliberalism]], the ideological backbone of contemporary globalized capitalism, has been "oversold", with the benefits of neoliberal policies being "fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries" and the costs, most significantly higher income inequality within nations, "hurt the level and sustainability of growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Foroohar |first=Rana |date=June 3, 2016 |title=Globalization's True Believers Are Having Second Thoughts|url=http://time.com/4356816/neoliberalism-imf-globalization/|work=TIME|location= |access-date=July 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-global governance===
{{Main|Global governance}}

Beginning in the 1930s, opposition arose to the idea of a world government, as advocated by organizations such as the [[World Federalist Movement]] (WFM). Those who oppose global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible, inevitably oppressive, or simply unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Paul. (2006.) ''The Parliament of Man: The Past, Present, and Future of the United Nations.'' New York: Harper Collins. {{ISBN|978-0375501654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, these opponents are wary of the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent. Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the [[League of Nations]] and, later, the [[United Nations]].

===Environmentalist opposition===
[[File:Madagascar highland plateau.jpg|thumb|[[Deforestation]] of the [[Madagascar]] Highland Plateau has led to extensive [[siltation]] and unstable flows of western [[river]]s.]]
{{Main|Environmentalism}}
{{See also|Global warming|Climate change|Deforestation}}

[[Environmentalism]] is a broad philosophy, ideology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/ideology.html |title=Ideology and Sustainability |publisher=Formal.stanford.edu |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ronald Bailey from the February 2002 issue |url=http://reason.com/archives/2002/02/01/debunking-green-myths |title=Debunking Green Myths |publisher=Reason.com |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Gibson. Environmentalism: Ideology and Power. Nova Science Pub Inc. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and social movement regarding concerns for environmental [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and improvement of the health of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Environmentalist concerns with globalization include issues such as [[global warming]], [[climate change]], global [[water supply]] and [[Water crisis|water crises]], inequity in [[energy consumption]] and [[energy conservation]], transnational [[air pollution]] and pollution of the [[world ocean]], [[overpopulation]], world [[habitat]] [[sustainability]], [[deforestation]], [[biodiversity]] and [[species extinction]].

One critique of globalization is that natural resources of the poor have been systematically taken over by the rich and the pollution promulgated by the rich is systematically dumped on the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Low, Nicholas. (2002). ''Global Ethics and Environment''. Routledge Science. {{ISBN|978-0415197359}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that Northern corporations are increasingly exploiting resources of less wealthy countries for their global activities while it is the South that is disproportionately bearing the environmental burden of the globalized economy. Globalization is thus leading to a type of" environmental [[apartheid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Frank J., and John Boli. 2012. ''The Globalization Reader'', 4th ed. Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0470655634}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helena Norberg-Hodge]], the director and founder of Local Futures/[[International Society for Ecology and Culture]], criticizes globalization in many ways. In her book ''[[Ancient Futures: Learning from Ladakh|Ancient Futures]]'', Norberg-Hodge claims that "centuries of ecological balance and social harmony are under threat from the pressures of development and globalization." She also criticizes the standardization and rationalization of globalization, as it does not always yield the expected growth outcomes. Although globalization takes similar steps in most countries, scholars such as Hodge claim that it might not be effective to certain countries and that globalization has actually moved some countries backward instead of developing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norberg-Hodge|first=Helena|title=Ancient futures : learning from Ladakh|year=1992|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0871566435|edition= Sierra Club Books paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related area of concern is the [[pollution haven hypothesis]], which posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require (see [[Race to the bottom]]).&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|author2=M. Scott Taylor|title=Unmasking the Pollution Haven Effect|journal=[[International Economic Review]]|year=2008|volume=49|issue=1|pages=223–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2008.00478.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often comes at the cost of environmentally sound practices. Developing countries with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]], and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards.  Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest [[environmental standard]]s or weakest enforcement.

== Food security ==
{{Main|Food security}}
The globalization of food production is associated with a more efficient system of food production. This is because crops are grown in countries with optimum growing conditions. This improvement causes an increase in the world's food supply which encourages improved food security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5160e.pdf|title=Food Security and International Trade Unpacking disputed narratives|last=Clapp|first=J|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
Norway's limited crop range advocates globalization of food production and availability. The northern-most country in Europe requires trade with other countries to ensure population food demands are met. The degree of self-sufficiency in food production is around 50% in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Flaten and Hisano, 2007. Food Security Policy in a Food Importing Country: The Case of Norway&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helmut Eberspächer''' (18 November 1915 – 19 June 2011) was a German businessman and chairman of [[Eberspächer]]. During [[World War II]], he served in the [[Wehrmacht]] as a fighter pilot. A [[flying ace]], he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] by [[Nazi Germany]].

In 1950, he and his cousin Walter took over the family business, Eberspächer GmbH. He ran the business as chairman until 1988, and remained as an honorary chairman until 2005. He also served on the board of the [[Confederation of German Employers' Associations]] (BDA) and the [[Verband der Automobilindustrie|German Automotive Industry Association]]. Under his leadership, Eberspächer became one of the leading automobile industry suppliers in Germany, with approximately 5,600 employees worldwide and 1.9 billion [[Euro]]s in sales in 2010.&lt;ref name="Eberspächer"&gt;{{cite web|work=Eberspächer |title=Helmut Eberspächer: a socio-politically committed entrepreneur |url=http://www.eberspaecher.com/nc/ca_fr/press/press-releases/individual-view/article/helmut-eberspaecher-ein-gesellschaftspolitisch-engagierter-unternehmer/8.html|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 he was fined for [[tax evasion]].

==Military career==
Eberspächer was born on 18 November 1915 in [[Tübingen]], [[Kingdom of Württemberg]], [[German Empire]]. In 1934 he volunteered for military service in the [[Reichswehr]], and served in an armoured reconnaissance battalion. In parallel to his military service he studied [[mechanical engineering]] at the [[University of Stuttgart]]. Following his graduation in 1939, he transferred to the Luftwaffe. From July 1940 to January 1943 he served with [[Lehrgeschwader 2]] (Demonstration Wing) on both [[Western Front (World War II)|Western]] and [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Fronts]]. He then converted to a [[ground attack]] role, and from March 1943 served with [[Schnellkampfgeschwader 10]] (10th Bomber Wing), flying fighter-bomber missions over southern England and anti-shipping operations in the English Channel and being appointed a squadron leader.&lt;ref name="Obermaier p105"&gt;Obermaier 1989, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on [[D-Day]] 6 June 1944, Eberspächer led four [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]s of 3./SKG 10 (3rd Squadron of SKG 10) over [[Normandy]]. At 05:01 they had intercepted a formation of [[Royal Air Force]] [[Avro Lancaster]]s. Three were claimed as downed by Eberspächer, one of them being Lancaster ND739 of [[No. 97 Squadron RAF]], flown by the squadron's commanding officer, W/C Jimmie Carter. His seven-man crew had earned four [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]es and three [[Distinguished Flying Medal]]s. The wreckage of ND739 was located and excavated in 2012. An assortment of items were recovered including the wedding ring belonging to crew member Albert Chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=DailyMail |title=For the love of Vera: D-Day Lancaster bomber crew identified 68 years on by poignant inscription on dead airman's ring |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2211250/Wreckage-Lancaster-bomber-crashed-D-Day-killing-crew-identified.html#ixzz2NeLRUuC6|accessdate=16 March 2013|location=London|date=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaloga 2011, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eberspächer was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Knight's Cross]] on 24 January 1945, after 170 missions over the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]]. He was credited with a total of seven aerial victories, including three at night.{{sfn|Brütting|1992|p=190}}

==Business career==
[[File:Jakob Eberspächer.jpg|thumb|right|Jakob Eberspächer, grandfather of Helmut and founder of the "Glasdachfabrik-Eberspächer".]]
After the war, Eberspächer joined the family business, which had been founded by his grandfather, Jakob Eberspächer, in 1865 as a plumber's workshop which was known as "Glasdachfabrik-Eberspächer" (Eberspächer Roof-Glazing). He succeeded [[Hanns-Martin Schleyer]] in 1978 as president of the ''Landesvereinigung Baden-Württembergischer Arbeitgeberverbände'' (State Federation of Baden-Württemberg Employers' Associations) after Schleyer was kidnapped and murdered by the [[Red Army Faction]] on 18 October 1977. Eberspächer also supported the [[Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart]].&lt;ref name="Eberspächer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart|title=Patrons|url=http://www.bachakademie.de/eng/836.html|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1989, in the aftermath of the [[Flick affair]], Eberspächer was fined 140,000 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] for [[tax evasion]]. He had transferred and donated more than 300,000 DM into the accounts of the political parties [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] via the "''Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wirtschaft Baden-Württemberg''" (the Society for the Advancement of Economics in Baden-Württemberg) between 1972 and 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|journal=Der Spiegel |volume=29|year=1989 |title=Kleines Licht|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13494402.html| language=German|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|journal=Der Spiegel |volume= 17|year=1989 |title=Mehr Steine als Brot|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13495402.html| language=German|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 19 June 2011 in [[Esslingen am Neckar]].&lt;ref name="Eberspächer"/&gt; The Eberspächer family are heirs of his business and are ranked 264th of the 500 richest Germans in 2013, with net assets of 450 Million Euros, an increase of 100 Million Euros over the year 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Güneri |first=Emel |date=1 February 2013 |work=

==Business interests==
The Huljich brothers (Chris, Paul and Michael), founded a food manufacturing business, at first under the name Top Hat Bacon, in the 1980s&lt;ref name="NBRRichList2010"&gt;The National Business Review, ''Rich List'', Auckland, 2010, p. 45 (published as an annex to ''The National Business Review'', 30 July 2010.)&lt;/ref&gt; specialising in various pork products or [[Charcuterie|small goods]] (e.g. processed meats bought from a delicatessen, such as [[bacon]], [[sausages]], [[pâté]] and [[salami]]). This enterprise grew into the Best Corporation (a major brand continued to be "Top Hat Bacon") which operated an important segment of the market in New Zealand and owned considerable assets in Australia.&lt;ref name="Eldred-Grigg"&gt;Stevan Eldred-Grigg, ''The Rich: A New Zealand History'', Penguin Books, Auckland, 1996, pp. 216 and 217&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s the three brothers sold Best Corporation to French food company [[Groupe Danone]] and also sold valuable Australian assets.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Rotherham, "Huljichs' Sydney bail-out signals return to bacon makin'", ''The Independent'',  16 December 1998, Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the sale of Best Corporation, the three  brothers separately invested their proceeds into different  interests:

The '''Institute of Certified Professional Managers''' (ICPM) is a US-based, non-profit, educational institute and certification body affiliated with the [[James Madison University]] College of Business, that provides education and [[Professional certification|certification]] in [[management]] to managers, supervisors and leaders working in all industries.  Founded in 1974.

== Certified Manager ==
The Institute of Certified Professional Managers (ICPM) sponsors the professional Certified Manager (CM) certification.  Through a comprehensive program of management and [[leadership]] development and [[Educational assessment|assessment]], the CM  certification validates managerial competency and leadership potential.

The CM certification program comprises application, [[training]] and assessment.  CM applicants meet eligibility requirements for [[education]] and experience to receive approval to pursue the CM certification.  Training on the comprehensive CM body of knowledge comprises 75–90 hours and can be completed in groups, as classroom training, or individually, as self-directed study. A job task analysis performed periodically confirms the [[knowledge, skills and abilities]] and forms the basis of the CM body of knowledge. Applicants control the pace of program completion within 15 months.

The CM certification is obtained by meeting eligibility requirements and passing three CM exams.  Certificants can use the “CM” professional credential after their name, i.e. John Smith, CM. Certificants complete professional development activities annually and pay a professional fee ($50) to maintain current CM status.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

== History ==
The Institute of Certified Professional Managers (ICPM) was established in 1974 through  a grant from the George R. Brown Foundation.  The Institute was formed to enhance recognition of management as a profession and to provide direction in the study of management.  Two organizations founded ICPM:  the International Management Council (IMC) and the [[National Management Association]] (NMA).

The International Management Council (IMC) was founded in 1903 by foremen who were members of the [[YMCA]] (Young Men's Christian Association).  Initially, named the Industrial Management Club, its mission was to train line managers for jobs in manufacturing.  IMC chapters were formed in over 40 US states and internationally in Taipei, Taiwan and Japan.  In 1971, the organization’s name was changed to the International Management Council and its membership expanded to include company presidents, managers and first line supervisors.  In 2003, IMC merged with the National Management Association.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

The [[National Management Association]] (NMA) was founded in 1925 by Mr. [[Charles F. Kettering]], a pioneer in human resource development.  Initially named the National Association of Foreman, today it goes by "NMA . . . THE Leadership Development Organization" to reflect its focus on leadership development.  NMA is a national, non-profit leadership development organization headquartered in [[Dayton]], [[Ohio]] with a membership of over 22,000.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2522">An '''interconnect agreement''' is a business [[contract]] between telecommunications organizations for the purpose of interconnecting their networks and exchanging telecommunications traffic. Interconnect agreements are found both in the [[public switched telephone network]] and the [[Internet]].

In the public switched telephone network, an interconnect agreement invariably involves settlement fees based on [[Calling party|call source]] and [[Called party|destination]], connection times and duration, when these fees do not cancel out between operators. 

On the Internet, where the concept of a "[[telephone call|call]]" is generally hard to define, settlement-free [[peering]] and [[Internet transit]] are common forms of interconnection. A contract for interconnection within the Internet is usually called a [[peering agreement]].

Interconnect agreements are typically complex [[contractual agreement]]s involving payment schemes and schedules, coordination of [[Policy-based routing|routing policies]], [[acceptable use policy|acceptable use policies]], traffic balancing requirements, technical standards, coordination of network operations, dispute resolution, etc. Legal and regulatory requirements are often an issue. For example, network operators may be forced by law to interconnect with their competitors. In the United States, the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] mandated methods of interconnection and the compensation models for doing so.

'''Juan Angel Tió Malaret''' (1874—1965) was a [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] [[politician]], businessman, entrepreneur and writer. He served as a member of the [[Senate of Puerto Rico]] from 1917 to 1920.

==Biography==

Juan Angel Tió Malaret was born February 26, 1874 in [[San Germán, Puerto Rico|San Germán]], [[Puerto Rico]] to Salvador Tió Urgell and Angela Malaret Anglada, both from [[Girona]], [[Catalonia]], in [[Spain]].

Tió Malaret was director of Caja de Ahorros, a small bank in Puerto Rico, until 1909. He then founded Caja Popular de Ahorros y Préstamos, incorporating it in 1917 as Banco de San Germán. He presided the institution until 1965. Tió was also owner of sugar mills Igualdad (in [[Añasco, Puerto Rico|Añasco]]) and Playa Grande (in [[Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques]]) until their expropriation at the start of [[World War II]].

In 1917, Tió Malaret was elected to the [[1st Puerto Rican Senate|first Senate of Puerto Rico]] for the [[Republican Party (Puerto Rico)|Republican Party]], representing the [[Puerto Rico Senatorial district IV|District of Mayagüez]]. He served in that position until 1920. 

In 1925, he served as mayor of [[San Germán, Puerto Rico|San Germán]] for several months. He was elected to the [[Senate of Puerto Rico|Senate]] again in 1928, this time as a member of the [[Alianza Puertorriqueña]] party, and served until 1932. At the 1932 elections, he was elected as mayor of San Germán again, serving until 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/Link%20P.R/www.linktopr.com/sangerman.html San Germán...

Angel Tió was also a writer and a [[poet]]. Some of his writings are featured in the book ''Horas Disipadas''. He also wrote the book ''Esencias del Folklore Puertorriqueño'', which was edited in 1967 by the San Germán Cultural Center.

Angel Tió was married to María Teresa Laura Nazario de Figueroa y Rodríguez de Astudillo. He died in August 12, 1965.

Born in [[Midland, Texas]], Bush graduated from [[Southern Methodist University]] in 1968 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[education]], and took a job as a [[second grade]] teacher. After attaining her [[master's degree]] in [[library science]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], she was employed as a librarian.

Bush met her future husband, George W. Bush, in 1977, and they were married later that year. The couple had twin daughters in 1981. Bush's political involvement began during her marriage. She campaigned with her husband during his unsuccessful 1978 run for the [[United States Congress]], and later for his successful [[Governor of Texas|Texas gubernatorial]] campaign.

As First Lady of Texas, Bush implemented many initiatives focused on health, education, and literacy.&lt;ref name=flt/&gt; In 1999–2000, she aided her husband in campaigning for the presidency in a number of ways, most notably delivering a keynote address at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]], which gained her national attention. She became First Lady after her husband was [[First inauguration of George W. Bush|inaugurated as president]] on January 20, 2001.

Polled by [[The Gallup Organization]] as one of the most popular First Ladies, Bush was involved in national and global concerns during her tenure.&lt;ref name=gallup/&gt; She continued to advance her trademark interests of education and literacy by establishing the semi-annual [[National Book Festival]] in 2001, and encouraged education on a worldwide scale. She also advanced women's causes through [[The Heart Truth]] and [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]] organizations. She represented the United States during her foreign trips, which tended to focus on HIV/AIDS and malaria awareness.

The year after their marriage, the couple began campaigning for George W. Bush's 1978 Congressional candidacy. According to George Bush, when he asked her to marry him, she had said, "Yes. But only if you promise me that I'll never have to make a campaign speech."&lt;ref name=unhillary/&gt; She soon relented, and gave her first stump speech for him in 1978 on the courthouse steps in [[Muleshoe, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Laura Welch Bush: Shy no more|first=John|last=Hanchette|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=June 23, 2000 |accessdate=April 21, 2011|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/e2147.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; After narrowly winning the [[primary election|primary]], he lost the general election.&lt;ref name=readherlips/&gt;

The Bushes had tried to conceive for three years, but pregnancy did not happen easily. On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to [[Twin#Fraternal (sororal; dizygotic) twins|fraternal twin]] daughters, [[Barbara Bush (born 1981)|Barbara]] and [[Jenna Bush Hager|Jenna]].&lt;ref name="Stritof, Sheri and Bob"/&gt; The twins were born five weeks early by an emergency [[Caesarean section]], as Laura had developed life-threatening [[pre-eclampsia]] (toxemia).&lt;ref name=readherlips/&gt;

Bush traveled to [[Kuwait]] in April 1993, accompanying her father-in-law and mother-in-law as well as brothers-in-law [[Jeb Bush|Jeb]] and [[Marvin Bush]] after former President Bush was invited to return to the [[Middle East]] for the first time since his presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=George H.

===Education and children===
Early into the administration, Bush made it known that she would focus much of her attention on education. This included recruiting highly qualified teachers to ensure that young children would be taught well.&lt;ref name=teach&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2001/02/wh-0226.html |title=First Lady Laura Bush Launches Education Initiatives |accessdate=May 26, 2008 |publisher=U.S. Department of Education |date=February 26, 2001 |archivedate=October 6, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006080554/http://www.ed.gov/news/pressreleases/2001/02/wh-0226.html |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also focused on early child development.&lt;ref name=teach/&gt; In 2001, to promote reading and education, she partnered with the [[Library of Congress]] to launch the annual [[National Book Festival]]. In January 2002, Bush testified before the Senate Committee on Education, asking for higher teachers' salaries and better training for [[Head Start Program|Head Start]] programs. She is also credited with creating a national initiative called "Ready to Read, Ready to Learn", which promotes reading at a young age. To promote American patriotic heritage in schools, she helped launch the [[National Anthem Project]]. In 2006, Bush and media executives worked together to provide a $500,000 grant for school libraries along the Gulf Coast which had been devastated by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.&lt;ref name="Bush Biography"/&gt;

Immediately following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Bush spoke regarding America's children:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e need to reassure our children that they are safe in their homes and schools. We need to reassure them that many people love them and care for them, and that while there are some bad people in the world, there are many more good people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=November 8, 2001 |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/11/20011108-7.html |title=Mrs. Laura Bush Speaks at the National Press Club |accessdate=May 25, 2008 |publisher=The White House |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514161913/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/11/20011108-7.html |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks, Bush inaugurated a music concert at the [[Kennedy Center]], organized to fundraise for families of the victims. Though she received applause, she returned the compliment to members of the audience and added that although the event was tragic, Americans had deepened their appreciation "of life itself, how fragile it can be, what a gift it is and how much we need each other".

Bush first became involved with [[The Heart Truth]] awareness campaign in 2003.&lt;ref name=ht&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/hearttruth/ambassador/index.htm |title=The Heart Truth Ambassador |accessdate=May 25, 2008 |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |archivedate=May 9, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509085726/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/hearttruth/ambassador/index.htm |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an organization established by the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] to raise awareness about [[heart disease]] in women, and how to prevent the condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 25, 2008 |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/hearttruth/whatis/index.htm |title=What is The Heart Truth? |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514223825/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/hearttruth/whatis/index.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She serves in the honorary position of ambassador for the program&lt;ref name=ht/&gt; leading the federal government's effort to give women a "wake up call" about the risk of heart disease.&lt;ref name=ht/&gt; She commented on the disease: "Like many women, I assumed heart disease was a man's disease and cancer was what we would fear the most. Yet heart disease kills more women in our country than all forms of cancer combined. When it comes to heart disease, education, prevention, and even a little red dress can save lives."&lt;ref name=ht/&gt; She has undertaken a signature personal element of traveling around the country and talking to women at hospital and community events featuring the experiences of women who live, or had lived, with the condition.&lt;ref name=ht/&gt; This outreach was credited with saving the life of one woman who went to the hospital after experiencing symptoms of a heart attack.&lt;ref name=ht/&gt;

With her predecessor, former First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]], Bush dedicated the First Ladies Red Dress Collection at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] in May 2005. It is an exhibit containing red suits worn by former First Ladies [[Lady Bird Johnson]], [[Betty Ford]], [[Rosalynn Carter]], Nancy Reagan, [[Barbara Bush]], [[Hillary Clinton]], and Laura Bush meant to raise awareness by highlighting America's first ladies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |title=First Ladies Red Dress Collection |accessdate=May 25, 2008 |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/hearttruth/events/first_ladies.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514201231/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/hearttruth/events/first_ladies.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has participated in fashion shows displaying red dresses worn on celebrities as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=May 25, 2008 |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/hearttruth/events/mbfw2008.htm |title=Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week: The Red Dress Collection 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509094818/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/hearttruth/events/mbfw2008.htm |archivedate=May 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush's mother, Jenna Welch, was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 78. She endured surgery and currently has no further signs of cancer. Laura Bush has become a breast cancer activist on her mother's behalf&lt;ref name=bc&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=December 13, 2006 |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/03/20030312-8.html |title=Remarks by Mrs. Bush at Susan G.

In November 2001, she became the first person other than a president to deliver the weekly presidential radio address. She used the opportunity to discuss the [[Women's rights in Afghanistan|plight of women in Afghanistan]] leading up to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]], saying "The brutal oppression of women is a central goal of the terrorists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/11/20011117.html |author=Laura Bush |title=Radio Address by Mrs. Bush |accessdate=December 13, 2006 |date=November 17, 2001 |publisher=Office of the First Lady |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514222608/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/11/20011117.html |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband was originally to give the address but he felt that she should do it; she later recalled, "At that moment, it was not that I found my voice.

===Campaigning===
[[File:Laura Bush-Bill Clinton.jpg|thumb|left|Bush appearing alongside [[Bill Clinton]] in New York, September 20, 2006]]
Bush campaigned for Republicans around the country in 2002 for that year's midterm elections, attending and hosting fundraisers as well as giving speeches that were deemed as the Bush administration "working against women's rights issues and using women to do their dirty work" and partly a test for Bush on how well she could campaign for her husband in the impending two years when he sought re-election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/west-wing-story-laura-bush-and-gender-card-146157|title=West Wing Story: Laura Bush and the Gender Card|first=Martha|last=Brant|publisher= Newsweek|date=October 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2004 election cycle, Bush made joint appearances with her husband on the campaign trail,&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/08/20040814-2.html President and Mrs. Bush's Remarks at Sioux City, Iowa Rally (August 14, 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt; including in battleground states such as Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/08/20040827-15.html Remarks by the President and the First Lady at Miami, Florida Rally (August 27, 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt; She advocated for his re-election in a speech at the [[2004 Republican National Convention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/31/gop.laurabush/index.html|title=Laura Bush urges nation to trust president |date=September 1, 2004|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was credited with having raised $15 million for her husband's campaign as well as the Republican Party while still succeeding in keeping a separate schedule that allowed for her to tend to the traditional duties she had as First Lady.&lt;ref name=Freerepublic&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1615918/posts|title=Laura Bush Hits the Campaign Trail|date=April 16, 2006|first=Anssie|last=Dasher|publisher=Free Republic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a July 2004 interview, [[Teresa Heinz]], wife of Democratic presidential nominee [[John Kerry]], said, "Well, you know, I don't know Laura Bush.

In races where the moderates are in the most trouble, Laura Bush is the one who can do the most good."&lt;ref name=campaignhit/&gt;

Sady Doyle reasoned that Bush was hard to dislike due to her adopting "the least partisan causes" such as literacy and breast cancer, which would attract the support of most Americans and her coming off as a "mild, polite, ordinary woman who might go to church with your mother, or organize suburban potlucks". Doyle furthered that her statements were never enough to offend others and the harshest criticism that could be bestowed upon her was that she was boring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2010/05/the-secret-inner-life-of-laura-bush/56644/|title=The Secret Inner Life of Laura Bush|date=May 13, 2010|first=Sady|last=Doyle|publisher=The Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She disagreed with [[Fox News]]' [[Chris Wallace (journalist)|Chris Wallace]] in 2006 when Wallace asked why the American people were beginning to lose confidence in President Bush, saying, "Well, I don't think they are. And I don't really believe those polls. I travel around the country, I see people, I see their response to my husband, I see their response to me. There are a lot of difficult challenges right now in the United States&amp;nbsp;... All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard. They're hard decisions to make. And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are. But I think people know that he is doing what he thinks is right for the United States, that he's doing what he – especially in the [[war on terror]], what he thinks he is obligated to do for the people in the United States, and that is to protect them&amp;nbsp;... When his polls were really high they weren't on the front page."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/05/20060512-11.html |title=Interview of Mrs. Laura Bush by Fox News |accessdate=May 28, 2008 |date=May 12, 2006 |publisher=The White House |archivedate=September 12, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912074853/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/05/20060512-11.html |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush said she was in the region in an attempt to improve America's image by highlighting concern for women's health, specifically promoting her breast cancer awareness work with the [[US-Middle East Partnership for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research]].&lt;ref name=middleeast&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=May 28, 2008 |date=October 28, 2007 |last=Wolfson |first=Paula |url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2007-10-28-voa11.html |title=Laura Bush Defines Her Policy Role |publisher=VOA News |archivedate=January 3, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103124331/http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2007-10-28-voa11.html |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=May 16, 2008 |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/05/20080516-19.html |title=Mrs. Bush's Remarks on the U.S.-Saudi Partnership for Breast Cancer Awareness and Research |publisher=The White House |place=[[King Fahd Medical City]], [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]] |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514222419/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/05/20080516-19.html |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; She defined the trip as successful, saying that [[stereotype]]s were broken on both sides.&lt;ref name=middleeast/&gt;

Overall, Bush traveled to 77 countries in the eight years of her husband's presidency, touring 67 of those during the second term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2009/05/laura-bush-fills-in-the-blanks-022897|title=Laura Bush fills in the blanks |first=Nia-Malika|last=Henderson|date=May 23, 2009|publisher=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on policy===
Bush is a [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]] and has identified herself with the GOP since her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watson|first1=Robert P.|title=Laura Bush: The Report to the First Lady 2005|date=2005|publisher=Nova Science Publisher |isbn=1594542902|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about abortion in 2000, Bush said she did not believe ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' should be overturned. She did not comment on whether women had the right to an abortion.&lt;ref name=abortion&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=May 28, 2008 |date=January 19, 2001 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/19/laurabush.abortion.02/ |title=Laura Bush's abortion comments 'personal views', Fleischer says |publisher=CNN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523020028/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/19/laurabush.abortion.02/ |archivedate=May 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did say, however, that the country should do "what we can to limit the number of abortions, to try to reduce the number of abortions in a lot of ways, and that is, by talking about responsibility with girls and boys, by teaching [[abstinence]], having abstinence classes everywhere in schools and in churches and in [[Sunday school]]".&lt;ref name=abortion/&gt;

Bush responded to a question during a 2006 interview concerning the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] by calling for elected leaders not to politicize [[same-sex marriage]], "I don't think it should be used as a campaign tool, obviously. It requires a lot of sensitivity to just talk about the issue&amp;nbsp;... a lot of sensitivity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2006/05/14/politics/p131514D67.DTL&amp;feed=rss.news |title=Mrs. Bush: Don't Campaign on Marriage Ban |last=Pickler |first=Nedra |accessdate=December 13, 2006 |date=May 14, 2006 |agency=Associated Press |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810084948/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2006%2F05%2F14%2Fpolitics%2Fp131514D67.DTL&amp;feed=rss.news |archivedate=August 10, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 12, 2005, while in South Africa, Bush suggested her husband replace retiring [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] with another woman. On October 2, during a private dinner at the White House with his wife, President Bush nominated [[Harriet Miers]] to replace O'Connor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/03/AR2005100300252.html|title=White House Counsel Miers Chosen for Court|author=Fletcher, Michael|accessdate=December 13, 2006|date=October 4, 2005|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, after Miers had faced intense criticism, Laura Bush questioned whether the charges were [[Sexism|sexist]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=VandeHei |first=Jim|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/11/AR2005101100456.html|title=Laura Bush Echoes Sexism Charge in Miers Debate|accessdate=December 13, 2006|date= October 12, 2005|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legacy ===
In late October 2008, days before that year's Presidential election, Bush hosted a three-hour session with staffers and historians discussing how she would like to be remembered, leading to this meeting being termed the "legacy lunch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/laura-bush-fills-in-the-blanks/|title=Laura Bush Fills In The Blanks|date=May 23, 2009|publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://parkcitiesblog.dallasnews.com/2009/05/laura-bush-shaping-her-own-leg.html/|title=Laura Bush: Shaping Her Own Legacy|publisher=Dallas Morning News|date=May 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Myra Gutin, this was the first time in history that a First Lady had ever directly reached out to historians to talk about her accomplishments. Attendants of the meeting said that Bush wanted to change the perception that she was a traditional First Lady in that she always stayed by her husband's side. Bush's chief of staff Anita McBride called this characterization of Bush "unfair" and though conceding that she was traditional, McBride noted Bush broke from tradition in addressing issues that were not customary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2009/05/laura-bush-fills-in-the-blanks-022897|title=Laura Bush fills in the blanks|publisher=POLITICO|date=May 23, 2009|first=Nia-Malika|last=Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, three months after the Bushes left office, Martha Gore wrote an op-ed piece titled "Laura Bush: A First Lady who made America proud", where she positively assessed Bush's role as First Lady and expressed Bush's successes were rooted in the dignity she brought to the office despite her reserved style as well as her making a good role model for young women and representing American womanhood at its finest. Gore concluded, "Now that Ms. Bush has returned to private life, she will continue to be remembered as a First Lady who did America proud."{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} A 2014 poll which asked who was the most popular First Lady in the past 25 years found Bush ranked in fourth place (out of 4 candidates), behind Hillary Clinton, mother-in-law Barbara and direct successor [[Michelle Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/05/09/first-ladies-poll-admired/8888099/|title=Who is the most admired first lady?|date=May 9, 2014|publisher=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/9/most-admired-first-ladies-barbara-bush-tied-hillar/|date=May 9, 2014 |publisher=Washington Times|title=It's official: Hillary Clinton was the best first lady}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Bush released her memoir, ''[[Spoken from the Heart]]'', in conjunction with a national tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/books/29book.html?pagewanted=all |title=Laura Bush, a Lonely Texas Girl Far From Home |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 28, 2010 |first=Michiko |last=Kakutani |accessdate=November 14, 2014 |deadurl=no |archivedate=November 18, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118015555/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/29/books/29book.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 11, 2010, during an interview on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', Bush was asked about [[same-sex marriage]]. She said she views it as a generational issue and said she believes it will be made legal in the future. Bush offered support for the issue by saying "when couples are committed to each other and love each other&amp;nbsp;... they ought to have the same sort of rights that everyone has." Bush referred to her 2000 interview, reaffirming her support for ''Roe v. Wade'', "I think it's important that [abortion] remain legal. Because I think it's important for people – that for medical reasons and, and other reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|HtNabdDx_mU|Laura Bush For Gay Marriage &amp; Pro-Choice!}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/09/27/george-w-bush-silent-on-same-sex-marriage-after-dad-helps-legalize-one |first=Steven|last=Nelson|title=George W.

On February 22, 2013, without her consent, she was included in a [[pro-gay]] advertisement from the Respect of Marriage Coalition. A statement from Bush's spokesperson states that Bush "did not approve of her inclusion in this advertisement nor is she associated with the group that made the ad in any way. When she became aware of the advertisement last night, we requested that the group remove her from it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abad-Santos |first=Alexander |title=Gay Marriage Supporter Laura Bush Wants Out of This Pro-Gay Marriage Ad |url=https://news.yahoo.com/gay-marriage-supporter-laura-bush-wants-pro-gay-153646950.html |accessdate=February 22, 2013 |publisher=[[Yahoo!

Bush continued to remain involved and concerned over the state of women in Afghanistan, speaking out editorials and appearances during 2013 that the women and girls who had been helped could not be abandoned during and after the planned [[withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="thd-hl"/&gt; In March 2016, Bush wrote an op-ed for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' on changes occurring among women in Afghanistan while noting continued violence and calling for American involvement in Afghanistan to be consistent and predictable in continuing along with the international community "to provide significant development assistance in the areas of health care, entrepreneurship and education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/how-afghanistans-women-are-helping-the-country-move-forward/2016/03/07/48f17ef2-e3ac-11e5-a6f3-21ccdbc5f74e_story.html?noredirect=on|title=How Afghanistan's women are helping the country move forward|first=Laura|last=Bush|publisher=Washington Post|date=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2016, Bush stated that she hoped the US remained in Afghanistan and had consulted with women there who feared the departure of American troops would create "a vacuum" similar to Iraq, furthering that the US "would have to start all over again" in the event that they withdrew troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/laura-bushs-case-for-remaining-in-afghanistan/489095/ |title=Laura Bush's Case for Remaining in Afghanistan|first=Yoni|last=Appelbaum|publisher=The Atlantic|date=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2017, Bush and [[First Lady of Afghanistan]] [[Rula Ghani]] traveled to Washington to rally lawmaker support for Afghanistan and women there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/13/politics/brooke-baldwin-laura-bush-rula-ghani-afghanistan-women/index.html|title=Laura Bush and Rula Ghani on 'opening the door' for women in Afghanistan|first=Brooke |last=Baldwin |publisher=CNN|date=November 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 17, 2018, Bush wrote an opinion piece firmly opposing the [[Trump administration family separation policy]] in the Washington Post.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/laura-bush-separating-children-from-their-parents-at-the-border-breaks-my-heart/2018/06/17/f2df517a-7287-11e8-9780-b1dd6a09b549_story.html Laura Bush: Separating children from their parents at the border ‘breaks my heart’]&lt;/ref&gt; She mentioned how her mother-in-law [[Barbara Bush]] had picked up a crying aids baby while on a visit to the HIV/Aids shelter "Grandma's House" in 1989. She mentioned this to indicate her shock upon discovery that the workers at the children's border shelter have been instructed "not to pick up or touch the children to comfort them".

In April 2013, Bush was in attendance at a news conference, where she said the recently built [[George W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2796">'''Louisa D'Andelot Carpenter''' (October 16, 1907 - February 8, 1976) was a [[du Pont]] heiress, [[Jazz Age]] [[socialite]] and [[aviator]].

==Biography==
She was born on October 16, 1907, to  [[R. R. M. Carpenter|Robert Ruliph Morgan Carpenter]] and Margaretta Lammot du Pont (May 12, 1884 - May 1973), daughter of [[Lammot du Pont]]. They were married December 18, 1906, in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. Her siblings were Irene "Renee" du Pont Carpenter Draper (January 21, 1911 - January 28, 1991), Nancy Gardiner Carpenter (June 19, 1912 - July 13, 1914), [[R. R. M. Carpenter, Jr.|Robert Ruliph Morgan Carpenter, Jr.]] (August 31, 1915 - 1990) and William Kemble Carpenter (May 27, 1919 - August 1987 [[Boca Raton, Florida]])

Louisa married [[du Pont]] executive John Lord King Jenney (September 8, 1904 - September 5, 2005) on July 20, 1929, and they were divorced in 1935. Jenney then remarried twice. First he married Anne Marshall West on November 11, 1938. After her death he married Mary Mellon Wise who survived his death.

Carpenter commissioned the paintings of [[thoroughbred]] horses "Jabneh" (b. 1952) in 1956 and his dam "Belle Soeur" (b. 1945) by equine artist [[Ann Collins]] in 1959.

She died when her private plane crashed near her [[Easton, Maryland]] farm on February 8, 1976, at the age of 68.

==Legacy==
Louisa enjoyed [[fox hunting]] as a [[Master of Fox Hounds]], shooting [[pheasant]]s, and riding and breeding horses. She was one of the first women airplane pilots.

Her circle of friends, socialites, acquaintances and lovers included Evelyn Eugenia (known as "Sister") and her sister [[Tallulah Bankhead]], [[Louise Brooks]], [[Marion Carstairs]], [[Noël Coward]], [[Greta Garbo]], [[Libby Holman]], [[Milly Monti]], [[Jane Bowles]] and [[Z. Smith Reynolds]]. Louisa was regarded as a [[lesbian]] and often appeared in public in men's suits and ties. When [[Libby Holman]] was indicted for the murder of her husband Zachary Smith Reynolds, Louisa Carpenter paid Libby's $25,000 [[bail]], appearing at the [[Wentworth, North Carolina]], courthouse in such mannish clothes that bystanders and reporters thought she was a man.

{{Intellectual property}}
In [[law]], '''misappropriation''' is the unauthorized use of another's name, likeness, or identity without that person's permission, resulting in harm to that person.

Another use of the word refers to intentional and illegal use of property or funds; it can particularly refer to when done by a [[public official]].

==Criminal law==
In criminal law, misappropriation is the intentional, illegal use of the [[property]] or funds of another person for one's own use or other unauthorized purpose, particularly by a public official, a [[trustee]] of a [[Trust law|trust]], an executor or administrator of a deceased person's [[estate (law)|estate]] or by any person with a responsibility to care for and protect another's assets (a [[fiduciary]] duty). Depending upon the [[jurisdiction]] and value of the property, misappropriation may be a [[felony]], a crime punishable by a prison sentence.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Scientific research==
In [[scientific method|scientific]] [[research]], misappropriation is a type of research misconduct. An investigator, scholar or reviewer can obtain novel ideas during the process of the exchange of ideas amongst colleagues and peers. However, improper use of such information could constitute fraud. This can include [[plagiarism]] of work or to make use of any information in breach of any duty of [[confidentiality]] associated with the review of manuscripts or grant applications.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Consequences of misappropriation==
Misappropriation can have very serious consequences, including imprisonment, fines, [[probation]], and a permanent criminal record.

The punishment for misappropriation may be determined by the value of the property affected and previous criminal record.

==Defenses==
Since misappropriation is considered a form of theft, arguments countering charges of theft can be modified and utilized against misappropriation, including:

*Property did not belong to the plaintiff. Information which is available to everyone, such as facts in a news story, is considered public and thus cannot be owned by the plaintiff.
*Independent development of property. The defendant did not “take” the plaintiff’s trade secrets if the defendant created the trade secrets independent of the plaintiff’s knowledge, resources and involvement.
*Consent by the plaintiff. If the plaintiff had given the defendant permission to use the property for a purpose, then the defendant cannot be guilty of misuse if the defendant used the property for that purpose.

==Differences between misappropriation and embezzlement==
[[Embezzlement]] is misappropriation when the property or funds involved have been lawfully entrusted to the embezzler. In circumstances where the funds are accessible to, but not entrusted to, the perpetrator, it is not embezzlement but can still be considered [[larceny]], misappropriation, misapplication, or some other similar term.

==Examples of misappropriation==
For an example, see [https://web.archive.org/web/20131112193722/http://www.courts.ca.gov/partners/documents/caci_2013_edition.pdf §1803] of the Judicial Council of California's Civil Jury Instructions from 2013.

'''Morris Herman DeGroot''' (June 8, 1931 – November 2, 1989) was an American statistician.

==Biography==
Born in [[Scranton]], [[Pennsylvania]], DeGroot graduated from [[Roosevelt University]] and earned master's and doctor's degrees from the [[University of Chicago]]. DeGroot joined [[Carnegie Mellon]] in 1957 and became a University Professor, the school's highest faculty position.

He was the founding editor of the [[review journal]] ''[[Statistical Science]]''.

==Academic works==
He wrote six books, edited four volumes and authored over one hundred papers.  Most of his research was on the theory of rational decision-making under uncertainty.  His ''Optimal Statistical Decisions'', published in 1970, is still recognized as one of the great books in the field. His courses on statistical decision theory taught at Carnegie-Mellon influenced [[Edward C. Prescott]] and [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Torsten |last=Persson |title=Economic Sciences, 1991–1995 |location= |publisher=World Scientific |year=1997 |isbn=981-02-3060-5 |pages=237–245 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hl3nkE1ZV8YC&amp;pg=PA237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; influential figures in the development of [[new classical macroeconomics]] and [[real business-cycle theory]]. DeGroot's undergraduate text, ''Probability and Statistics'', published in 1975, is widely recognized as a classic textbook.

An '''online research community''' (part of Research 2.0) is a part of an emerging and developing area in [[market research]] making  use of developments in [[Web 2.0]] technologies and [[online communities]]. They allow [[qualitative research]] to be conducted efficiently and deeply online.

Both public and private online communities offer opportunities for research, but many brands are wary of sharing company information openly. Invitation-only, private online communities centred on a single brand or customer segment may be the solution. These private communities can also engage customer groups or target consumers who might be difficult to reach using traditional off-line methodologies. Consumers enjoy this new, more participative research approach and the interaction with other users re-introduces the social context often missing from other research approaches that conceive of the consumer as an isolated individual.

Brands also benefit from online communities by having them on-hand to answer questions, test hypotheses, and observe. Online technology can adapt to almost any research need, be it showing creative stimulus material, gathering ideas for [[innovation]] and [[co-creation]] or simply an instant 'go/no go' needed. The continuity built through online networks brings new possibilities for supporting ideation processes. With a group of people on board, research can keep pace with internal development processes, providing a consumer feedback loop to check new ideas, such as product development, from inception to launch.

In an online research community members (rather than respondents) talk to each other – they exchange ideas and discuss issues with each other. Unlike a panel this lets researchers observe how people interact, the language they use, and lets them raise the questions they want to ask, which results in richer responses.

'''''Planet Money''''' is an American [[podcast]] and [[blog]] produced by [[NPR]]. Using "creative and entertaining" dialogue and narrative, Planet Money claims to be "The Economy Explained".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/04/27/135599807/about-planet-money|title=About Planet Money|last=|first=|date=April 1, 2010|website=www.npr.org/sections/money/|access-date=March 20, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320230833/https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/04/27/135599807/about-planet-money|archivedate=March 20, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The podcast launched on September 6, 2008 to cover the [[global financial crisis of 2008–2009]] in the wake of the [[Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac]]. It was created after the success of "[[The Giant Pool of Money]]", an episode of ''This American Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Giant Pool Of Money' Named To Decade Top 10 List |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/04/giant_pool_of_money_named_to_d.html |publisher=Planet Money |date=April 5, 2010 |accessdate=June 3, 2010 |quote='The Giant Pool of Money'—the hour-long ''This American Life'' episode that explained the housing bust and gave rise to Planet Money—was just named one of the top 10 works of U.S. journalism of the past decade. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408172914/http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2010/04/giant_pool_of_money_named_to_d.html |archivedate=April 8, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, episodes are hosted by [[Robert Smith (journalist)|Robert Smith]], Stacey Vanek Smith, Kenny Malone, [[Ailsa Chang]], Jacob Goldstein, Noel King, Sarah Gonzalez, Karen Duffin and Cardiff Garcia.

== Program ==
The length of the podcasts ranges between 6-30 minutes. Planet Money uses abridged narratives to tackle popular complex topics like [[Health care in the United States|American health care]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/03/27/597393265/costly-care-in-america|title=Costly Care In America|last=|first=|date=March 27, 2018|website=NPR.org|access-date=April 11, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410201528/https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/03/27/597393265/costly-care-in-america|archivedate=April 10, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[insider trading]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/03/23/596533461/episode-671-an-insider-trader-tells-all|title=An Insider Trader Tells All|last=|first=|date=March 23, 2018|website=NPR.org|access-date=April 11, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410201531/https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/03/23/596533461/episode-671-an-insider-trader-tells-all|archivedate=April 10, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to make economic journalism approachable to audiences that are interested in learning more about popular economic issues without an academic background in economics. The episodes are typically stand-alone. The interviewees or guest range from academic experts, business professionals or general members of the North American public. Providing listeners with primary source material, the podcast's host contributes contextual framing and commentary. The intimate stories are used as a leading thread and use commonplace language with entertaining plots to describe abstract or complex economic and political issues. This method of entertainment translates political or economic topics, that were historically dependent on academic language and higher education, to stories that engage the general public. This technique allows for larger and/or younger audiences while continuing to maintain contact with original markets by drawing from popular topics within North American culture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidshaywitz/2013/08/06/is-planet-money-bad-for-the-podcast-economy/#74dd6d6d10fc|title=Is Planet Money Bad For The Podcast Economy?|last=Shaywitz|first=David|date=Aug 6, 2013|website=Forbes|access-date=April 10, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413044615/https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidshaywitz/2013/08/06/is-planet-money-bad-for-the-podcast-economy/#74dd6d6d10fc|archivedate=April 13, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Planet Money'' also provides regular reports for ''[[Morning Edition]]'' and ''[[All Things Considered]]'' and occasional episodes of ''This American Life''. ''Planet Money'' was the first to report the small print in the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] that allowed deviation from the original [[Paulson plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2008/10/fine_print_a_backdoor_bailout.html |title=Fine Print: A 'Back-Door' Bailout? |work=Planet Money Blog |date=October 3, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424190014/http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2008/10/fine_print_a_backdoor_bailout.html |archivedate=April 24, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Max Baucus]] praised the show's attempts to explain the financial crisis "in terms the average American starts to understand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/includes/templates/library/flash_popup.php?pID=284419-1&amp;clipStart=8529.86&amp;clipStop=8654.54 |title=Treasury Sec.

&lt;/ref&gt;

''Planet Money'' was involved in a series about the [[Wells Fargo account fraud scandal]], which earned NPR a [[List_of_Peabody_Award_winners_(2010–19)#2016|2016 Peabody Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/about-npr/525542513/2016-peabody-award-for-nprs-investigation-of-wells-fargo-scandal|title=2016 Peabody Award For NPR's Investigation Of Wells Fargo Scandal|publisher=|accessdate=July 1, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180701140143/https://www.npr.org/about-npr/525542513/2016-peabody-award-for-nprs-investigation-of-wells-fargo-scandal|archivedate=July 1, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 2018, the first episode of ''Planet Money Shorts'' was released&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/03/30/598318231/watch-planet-money-shorts|title=Watch Planet Money Shorts|last=|first=|date=March 30, 2018|website=NPR.org|access-date=April 10, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409194551/https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2018/03/30/598318231/watch-planet-money-shorts|archivedate=April 9, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;. ''Planet Money Shorts'' consists of six episodes, each of which is less than five minutes. ''Planet Money'' is published by NPR and can be streamed or downloaded off of their webpage as an audio file or watched with visuals on their [[YouTube]] channel.

In 2017, ''The Indicator'' was launched as ''Planet Money''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s first spin-off hosted by ''Planet Money''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Stacey Vanek Smith and the ''[[Financial Times]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' Cardiff Garcia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/about-npr/567830557/npr-launches-the-indicator-from-planet-money|title=NPR Launches The Indicator from Planet Money|last=|first=|date=December 4, 2017|website=NPR.org|access-date=April 11, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410190005/https://www.npr.org/about-npr/567830557/npr-launches-the-indicator-from-planet-money|archivedate=April 10, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a similar storytelling approach, it delivers faster, shorter podcasts, more frequently. Each episode breaks down a big idea, using ''Planet Money''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s style of witty entertainment-journalism. Each episode is approximately 10 minutes or less and is published every weekday.

''Planet Money'' has launched unique projects including buying 100 barrels of crude oil and followed it from ground to gas tank; launched a satellite and built an algorithmic trading Twitter bot &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Inspired by the book: ''The Travels Of A T-shirt In The Global Economy'' by [[Pietra Rivoli]], the Planet Money team made a T-shirt and followed the shirt in a step-by-step journey from resource production to manufacturing, around the world &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.npr.org/tshirt/#/about|title=NPR T-shirt: How We Did This|last=|first=|date=December 2, 2013|website=NPR|access-date=March 20, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180411204328/http://apps.npr.org/tshirt/#/about|archivedate=April 11, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The design for the shirt was a squirrel hoisting a martini glass, which was meant to reference the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]]' phrase for the human elements in economics, the “animal spirits” &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. More than 25,000 of the shirts were sold online. The t-shirt sales were used as an effort that ultimately wound up on Kickstarter and turned out, unexpectedly, to be a runaway hit, raising more than 10x their original target of $50K &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidshaywitz/2013/08/06/is-planet-money-bad-for-the-podcast-economy/#13af402a10fc|title=Is Planet Money Bad For The Podcast Economy?|last=Shaywitz|first=David|date=Aug 6, 2013|work=Forbes Magazine|access-date=March 17, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321064835/https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidshaywitz/2013/08/06/is-planet-money-bad-for-the-podcast-economy/#13af402a10fc|archivedate=March 21, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Public Auditorium''' (also known as '''Public Hall''') is a multi-purpose [[performing arts]], [[entertainment]], [[sports venue|sports]], and [[Trade fair|exposition]] facility located in the civic center district of [[Downtown Cleveland|downtown]] [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].  The 10,000-capacity main auditorium shares its stage with a second [[Music venue|venue]] housed at the facility: the 3,000-capacity '''Music Hall'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.cleveland-oh.gov/CityofCleveland/Home/Government/CityAgencies/ParksRecreationandProperties/AuditoriumandConferenceCenter |title=Public Auditorium and Conference Center |publisher=City of Cleveland |accessdate=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2015|title=The Cleveland Group Plan of 1903: Public Auditorium/Public Hall|url=http://www.clevelandmemory.org/groupplan/auditorium.html|work=ClevelandMemory.org|publisher=Michael Schwartz Library - Cleveland State University|accessdate=March 2, 2015|quote=The Public Auditorium shares a stage with the Music Hall.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Public Auditorium was planned and funded prior to [[World War I]], construction did not begin until 1920, and the building did not open until 1922.  Designed by city architect J. Harold McDowell and Frank Walker of [[Walker and Weeks]] in a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style matching the other [[Group Plan]] buildings, it was the largest of its kind when opened, then seating 11,500.&lt;ref name=ech&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Auditorium |url=http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=PA5 |work=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History |date=May 13, 1998 |accessdate=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and expansion==
The auditorium cornerstone was laid October 20, 1920, and the completed building was dedicated April 15, 1922. Smith &amp; Oby was one local company involved in the project, at the time the largest convention hall in the United States. The main arena floor is {{convert|300|x|215|ft|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|80|ft|abbr=on}} high. No columns were used in its construction. With all its removable seats in place on the arena floor and in the balcony, the hall could seat 13,000.&lt;ref name=salisbury&gt;{{cite news|last=Salisbury|first=Wilma|title=An Unconventional Renovation|work=Plain Dealer Magazine|date=June 26, 1988|pages=10, 13, 15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main stage is {{convert|140|x|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} with a {{convert|72|x|42|ft|m|abbr=on}} proscenium arch. A key attraction was a spectacular pipe organ, Opus 328, the largest ever built at one time by [[E.M. Skinner]] with 10,010 pipes and 150 direct speaking stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.municipalorgans.net/?page_id=344|title=The Cleveland Public Auditorium &amp; its Organ |publisher=The American Municipal Pipe Organ Website |year=2009 |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Preserve historic pipe organ housed in Public Auditorium| date=May 10, 2009| last=Robinson| first=Racquel| url=http://www.cleveland.com/opinion/index.ssf/2009/05/preserve_historic_pipe_organ_h.html| work=The Plain Dealer| accessdate=July 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belowground, a basement Exhibition Hall provided more than {{convert|28500|ft2|m2|abbr=on}} of exhibition space. This space was reached by an elegant stone staircased with bronze lights which led down from Public Auditorium's lobby. But the exhibition space itself was uninviting. It had an [[asphalt]] floor, was undecorated, and was interrupted by more than 40 columns.&lt;ref name=salisbury /&gt;

Public Auditorium was considered so advanced architecturally that it became the model for similar public auditoriums in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]], and [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=salisbury /&gt;

==Greater Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame==
The [[Greater Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame]] displays duplicates of many of the plaques it has awarded in the lobby at the Lakeside Avenue entrance to the Cleveland Public Auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clevelandsportshall.com/about-hall/&lt;/ref&gt;

===1928 and 1936 additions===
In 1928, the Music Hall and Little Theater were added at the south end of Public Auditorium, and a terrace added to the north end.&lt;ref name=salisbury /&gt; The stage between the main hall and Music Hall was shared by both halls by employing a curtain system.

In 1936, two underground spaces were added to Public Auditorium.  The ballroom was built beneath Mall B of the [[The Mall (Cleveland)|Cleveland Mall]], while the Lakeside Exhibition Hall (also known as the North Exhibition Hall) was built below Mall C between the [[Cuyahoga County Courthouse]] and [[Cleveland City Hall]].&lt;ref name=salisbury /&gt;

The seating capacity of the main auditorium, including the main floor and the U-shaped balcony, was eventually reduced to about 10,000.&lt;ref name=gleisserfacelift&gt;{{cite news|last=Gleisser|first=Marcus|title=Convention Center Face Lift, Surgery Almost Complete|work=The Plain Dealer|date=April 17, 1987|page=B16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music Hall seats 3,000,&lt;ref name=gleisserfacelift /&gt; and the Little Theater 600.&lt;ref name=gleisserfacelift /&gt;

===1964 alterations===
In 1964, the city constructed a [[Cleveland Convention Center (demolished)|new underground convention center]]. The ballroom/exhibition space below Mall B was demolished and a much larger "Great Hall" (the convention center) built in its place.  A tunnel was constructed below Lakeside Avenue to connect the new "Great Hall" to the Lakeside Exhibition Hall. On the west side of Public Auditorium, a four-story (one source says three-and-a-half story)&lt;ref name=gleisserfacelift /&gt; modern glass and metal entrance pavilion added new lobby space for both buildings.

===1987 renovations===
From 1983 to 1987, the convention center and Public Auditorium were both extensively renovated. The Exhibition Hall below Public Auditorium was radically changed, with a lobby/ballroom created out of former service space at the north end of the hall. A stone staircase was built in this area to connect the space to the hall above.&lt;ref name=salisbury /&gt; This area could accommodate up to 2,000 people.  The rest of the old Exhibition Hall was turned into 15 meeting rooms (ranging in size from 10 to 700 seats), office space, a [[Bar#Types|cocktail lounge]], and a [[piano bar]] arranged around a central block.&lt;ref name=firstphase&gt;{{cite news|title=Convention Center Unveils First Phase of Renovations|work=The Plain Dealer|date=June 10, 1986|page=C3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A corridor hugged the exterior wall of the old hall, providing access to the meeting rooms. This corridor had decorative stone panels on one side and painted wood on the other, and was lined with sturdy chair upholstered in luggage fabric. The old asphalt floor was covered with concrete, and then tiled and carpeted. [[Cove lighting]] lit the corridor and meeting rooms.&lt;ref name=salisbury /&gt; The Lakeside Exhibition Hall was converted into a ballroom with kitchen, and the north wall of the hall torn out and replaced with a glass [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] that had views of [[Lake Erie]].

The bathrooms in Public Auditorium were renovated to make them accessible as well as modern,&lt;ref name=hicksboardOKs&gt;{{cite news|last=Hicks|first=Jonathan P.|title=Board OKs $28 Million Convention Center Renovation|work=The Plain Dealer|date=December 1, 1984|page=E2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all public spaces in Public Auditorium were retiled, repainted, and replastered, while furniture received new upholstery.&lt;ref name=dewittixcenter&gt;{{cite news|last=DeWitt|first=John|title=IX Center Takes On Biggies|work=The Plain Dealer|date=March 23, 1986|page=A25, A32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The north terrace was rebuilt in four different colors of granite.&lt;ref name=chatmannewlook /&gt; New [[taxicab stand]]s were built at each end of Public Auditorium, and small gardens placed at each end of each taxi stand.&lt;ref name="gleisserfacelift"/&gt;

The overall decorating scheme featured colors of muted beige, blue, gray, green, and rose.&lt;ref name=firstphase /&gt;

The reception pavilion received a $1.8 million (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1800000|1987}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) overhaul. Its exterior metal [[façade]] was removed&lt;ref name=gleisserfacelift /&gt; and replaced with [[beige]] [[limestone]].&lt;ref name=chatmannewlook&gt;{{cite news|last=Chatman|first=Angela D.|title=New Look on the Mall|work=The Plain Dealer|date=October 6, 1987|pages=D1, D6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The glass curtain wall received new mechanical louvers.&lt;ref name=gleisserfacelift /&gt; The interior wall coverings of dark wood paneling and bronzed aluminum were replaced with a cream-colored [[travertine]] wainscoting&lt;ref name=chatmannewlook /&gt; topped by a band of polished stone.&lt;ref name=salisbury /&gt; Fabric covered the walls above the bandk,&lt;ref name=gleisserfacelift /&gt; and white wooden grills were used to help break up the space.&lt;ref name=salisbury /&gt; A new terrazzo floor in pastel colors was also installed.&lt;ref name=salisbury /&gt; Displays about where to eat, drink, and shop in downtown Cleveland were added to the lobby, as were several kiosks where airlines could assist convention-goers in making plane reservations. Six {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} trees were planted inside the lobby to make it more inviting,&lt;ref name=chatmannewlook /&gt; and new paving and exterior lighting were installed outside the pavilion.&lt;ref name=gleisserfacelift /&gt;

A number of changes were made to the landscape around Public Auditorium. New signage with contemporary graphics were installed throughout the area.&lt;ref name=salisbury /&gt; The pedestrian bridge over E. Mall Drive, which connected the upper level of the reception pavilion to Mall B, was reconfigured into a small plaza with flagpoles. Over the entrance to the pavilion hung a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} sculpture. Consisting of a number of metal flags, it spun in the wind.&lt;ref name=chatmannewlook /&gt; Around Public Auditorium, new streetlight lampposts, based on a 1922 design, were manufactured and installed.&lt;ref name=chatmannewlook /&gt;&lt;ref name=salisbury /&gt; The terraces on the north and south ends of Public Auditorium were also refubished. Both received new stone paving and new wooden benches for seating, and the plain aluminum railings were painted to look like [[copper]]. The terraces were made more friendly by also adding a number of small trees in planters. A new [[Postmodern architecture|Postmodern-style]] arch was constructed to mark the entrance to the north terrace.&lt;ref name=salisbury /&gt;

===2000s changes===
In 2008, all seats were replaced in the balcony.&lt;ref name=renovations&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas |last=Ott |title=Cleveland's Public Auditorium set for renovation, marketing |url=http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/08/cleveland_to_begin_renovation.html |work=The Plain Dealer |date=August 20, 2011 |accessdate=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the city sold the underground convention center to [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]], which repurposed it to construct the new $465 million [[Huntington Convention Center of Cleveland|Cleveland Convention Center]], connected to the [[Global Center for Health Innovation]]. The work included a $3.9 million renovation and restoration of Public Auditorium.&lt;ref name=renovations /&gt; The 1964 pavilion addition was demolished, and the building's west facade was restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Walls come tumbling down at Cleveland's Public Auditorium |first= Laura |last=Johnston |url=http://www.cleveland.com/medicalmart/index.ssf/2011/03/and_the_walls_come_tumbling_do.html |work=The Plain Dealer |date=March 18, 2011 |accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the neighboring Crowne Plaza was sold and renovated as the [[Westin Hotel Cleveland]] in 2013, its new owners considered building a [[skywalk]] across East 6th Street connecting it to Public Auditorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Michelle |last=Jarboe |title=Downtown Cleveland skywalk plans prompt lofty debate about city landscape |url=http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2013/03/downtown_cleveland_skywalk_pla.html |work=The Plain Dealer |date=March 25, 2013 |accessdate=December 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not constructed.

'''Col. Richard Lee II''' (1647–1715) was a Colonel, planter, politician, and Member of the Upper House and of the King's Council of Virginia.

Richard II was termed "Richard the Scholar".  Richard was the son of [[Richard Lee I|Col. Richard Lee I]], "the Immigrant" (1618–1664) and Anne Constable (?) (ca. 1621–1666){{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Richard was born at "Paradise", in [[Northumberland County, Virginia]], the estate he inherited from his father when his father died in 1664.  This estate consisted of {{convert|1350|acre|km2}}, and was later part of Gloucester County.  He was educated at Oxford in England and may have studied law at the London [[Inns of Court]].  He seemed destined for a career in the church, but he elected rather to return to the life of a Virginia gentleman, residing at "Paradise".  In 1673, when his older brother John died unmarried, Richard inherited the estate, "[[Machodoc]]".  Richard left "Paradise" to overseers and removed to his new estate.

[[Image:Laetitia (Corbin) Lee.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Laetitia (Corbin) Lee]]

Richard married Laetitia Corbin (ca. 1657–1706), daughter of Richard's neighbor and, Councillor, Hon. Henry Corbin, Sr. (1629–1676) and Alice (Eltonhead) Burnham (ca. 1627–1684) {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Soon after his marriage, Richard was elected to the [[House of Burgesses]].  In 1676 Richard became a member of the King's Council and he served in this capacity off and on until 1698.  On one such absence in 1690 he had lost his seat because of his refusal to take the oath of allegiance to [[William III of England|William III]], [[King of England]] ("William of Orange") (1650–1702).  However, he was reinstated within a year.  Richard was forced to retire from this position because of ill health.  The Council was a body that served as the Governor's privy council, the Upper House of the Colonial Legislature, and the Colonial Supreme Court.  As early as 1680 he was Colonel of Horse in the counties of Westmoreland, Northumberland and Stafford.  He was appointed by Sir Gov. [[Edmund Andros]] (1637–1714) to be "''Naval Officer and Receiver of Virginia Dutys for the River Potomac''".  Richard II, had one of the largest libraries in the Colony.  He spent almost his whole life in study, and usually wrote his notes in Greek, Hebrew, or Latin.  It was because of this that he was termed "the scholar".  Richard was a supporter of the Established Church.

Richard died March 12, 1714 at "Machodoc", [[Westmoreland County, Virginia|Westmoreland County]].  His will was probated on April 27, 1715.  He was buried at the old "Burnt House Fields", located near "Mount Pleasant".  Laetitia died on October 6, 1706 at "Machodoc", and her tombstone can still be seen at "Mount Pleasant".

Richard established his residence at the "Machodoc" plantation, which was located on the [[Potomac River]], near the town of Hague, in Westmoreland County.  This was a large brick house, largely inclosed by a brick wall.  The estate was inherited by his son Hon. Richard Lee III (1679–1718) who was at the time residing in London as a tobacco merchant with his family.  Richard III leased his estate in Virginia to his brothers, [[Thomas Lee (Virginia colonist)|Thomas]], Hon. (1690–1750) and [[Henry Lee I|Henry]] (1691–1747), for "''an annual rent of one peppercorn only, payable on Christmas Day''".  After Richard's death in 1718, the estate was sold by his wife [[Martha Silk]] (d.ca. 1734), who sold it to her brother-in-law, Colonel Thomas Lee, Hon. (1690–1750).  Thomas resided here until it burned down January 29, 1729, and removed to his newly built "[[Stratford Hall (plantation)|Stratford Hall]]".  The fire was so serious that the field near the old mansion at "Machodoc" where the Lee burial ground became was forever named the old "Burnt House Fields".  The land was sold to Richard Lee III's only son Col. George Lee (1714–1761), who had come over from England.  A new plantation was built by George who called his new estate "Mount Pleasant".  The new house was built further back from the river and upon higher ground.  This house also burned down.

'''Same Sky''' is a cause-based trade initiative that provides training and employment for [[HIV-positive]] women survivors of the 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]] struggling to lift themselves out of poverty.  Same Sky is headquartered in [[New York City]].

In 2013, Same Sky began to employ women in America through the Same Sky America Pilot Project in Jersey City. Called Same Sky America, this project works with the women of the Most Excellent Way Learning Life Center who are working to rebuild their lives after incarceration.

Founded in 2007 by Francine LeFrak (daughter of New York real estate developer [[Samuel J. LeFrak]]), Same Sky partners with the handicraft organization Gahaya Links in [[Kigali]], [[Rwanda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2011/march/20110310samesky|title=Women under the Same Sky|website=www.UNAIDS.org|access-date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Same Sky also partners with select online retailers, including the nonprofit Shopping for a Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shoppingforachange.org/collections/same-sky|title=Shopping for a Change: Same Sky|website=ShoppingForAChange.org|access-date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The women [[artisan]]s that Same Sky employs make [[crochet]]ed glass-beaded [[bracelet]]s, which are made from hand-blown glass beads from California.

Same Sky products can be seen on celebrities such as Bono, Halle Berry, Ben Affleck, Meryl Streep, Fergie, Hillary Clinton, Usher, and Kris Jenner.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Founder ==
Founder Francine LeFrak is a television, theatrical and film producer. Born on October 18, 1948, in New York City, LeFrak has used her work as a producer to bring attention towards social, global issues. As the winner of Tony, EMMY and Peabody awards LeFrak is extremely, hugely and humungously praised in the film world. Widely recognised by really quite a few people as one of the towering geniuses of 20th century global entertainment, she nonetheless manages to remain unbelievably modest. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} On top of these honors Francine was recognized by the United Nations with a Women Together Award as well as an Ellis Island Medal of Honor and a Human Spirit Award. LeFrak founded Same Sky in 2007 to aid and support those affected by the Rwandan genocide. 

=== Notable works ===
* ''Shot Through the Heart'' (producer)
* ''Miss Rose White'' (producer)
* ''Mi vida loca'' (producer) 
* ''The Infiltrator'' (producer)

== Rwandan genocide (1994) ==
The Rwandan genocide was a 100-day period from April 7 to mid-July 1994 when approximately over 800,000 Rwandans were killed. This marked 70% to 80% of the Tutsi population, but the genocide ended when the Rwandan Patriotic Front led by Paul Kagame gained control in the country. 

The genocide was orchestrated by individuals who held high positions in the national government. While the period was brief the genocide had a major effect on Rwanda. Rape was used as a weapon, causing a huge rise in HIV infection. Not only was the population depleted but also the infrastructure of the country suffered huge damage.&lt;ref name="weebly.com"/&gt;

== Same Sky America ==
Although the company was founded to help those affected by the Rwandan genocide, its efforts have continued in America to support formerly incarcerated women. Same Sky prides itself on avoiding handouts and instead giving women the tools they need to lead a successful life. Francine LeFrak worked with The Most Excellent Halfway House to train previously incarcerated women to create jewelry and earn a steady income.&lt;ref name="weebly.com"/&gt;

== History ==
In 2007, Francine’s LeFrak's friend [[Willa Shalit]], who produced baskets and jewelry in Rwanda through her company, asked her to consider designing and marketing different types of mesh bracelets. LeFrak agreed to do so, and she worked to create a unique design that was both cost-efficient and reproducible by Rwandan artisans. LeFrak found and fell in love with a design created by AIDS activist and artist [[Mary Fisher (activist)|Mary Fisher]] that featured hand-blown glass beads. She quickly began to expand on it, and to grow this prototype into a wide range of colors and collections. Willa then encouraged her to take over production and grow the project on her own.

Once she began production, Francine learned about a group of women that were involved in the Rwandan genocide that had been raped and contracted HIV/AIDS. She then starting working with a handful of these abused women that had been trained to crochet by Mary Fisher. Francine then shipped the glass beads from the United States to Rwanda by sending suitcases with friends who happened to be traveling to this area. This marked the beginning of Same Sky's production, and it has sold over 45,000 pieces of jewelry since.&lt;ref name="weebly.com"/&gt;

'''Shahe''' ({{zh|c=[[wiktionary:沙|沙]][[wiktionary:河|河]]|p=Shāhé}}) is a [[county-level city]] in the [[prefecture-level city]] of [[Xingtai]], in the southern part of [[Hebei]] province, China.

Shahe has been called China's "glass capital." Its [[glass]] factories manufacture about ten percent of the world supply of [[flat glass]]. About 50,000 of Shahe's 480,000 residents work in the glass industry.

[[Smog]] in Shahe has become a serious problem, with some factories preferring to pay fines rather than comply with [[Pollution in China|air pollution]] enforcement requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2111976/grim-news-front-line-chinas-battle-against-air-pollution|title=Grim news from front line of China’s battle against air pollution|last=Zhou|first=Viola|date=2017-09-21|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2017-09-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr '''Tiede Herrema''' (born 21 April 1921) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] businessman. He was born in [[Zuilen]].

==Kidnapping==
In the 1970s, Herrema ran a wire factory, Ferenka, in the city of [[Limerick]], [[Ireland]]. At the time, this was the city's biggest employer, with approximately 1,400 workers. On the morning of 3 October 1975, having just left his home in Castletroy near Limerick, Herrema was abducted by two members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], Eddie Gallagher and [[Marion Coyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4354020.stm|title=IRA kidnap victim returns to city|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-06-06|date=2005-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kidnappers demanded the release of three IRA prisoners, including [[Rose Dugdale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Hostage Dilemma|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946574,00.html|date=1975-10-20|accessdate=2009-06-06|publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rescue==
After a massive security operation, the kidnappers were eventually traced on 21 October 1975 to a house in [[Monasterevin]], [[County Kildare]]. After a further two-week-long siege, Herrema was released, shaken but unharmed.&lt;ref name="rte"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/1018/herremat.html|title=Herrema donating papers to UL library|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]|date=2005-10-18|accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Ireland soon after.

==Aftermath==
He eventually returned to present an episode of ''[[Saturday Live (Irish TV series)|Saturday Live]]''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}{{When|date=June 2009}} He and his wife Elizabeth were made [[Irish nationality law#Honorary Grant of Irish Citizenship|honorary Irish citizens]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20041130.xml&amp;Node=821|title=Parliamentary Debates (Official Report - Unrevised) Dáil Éireann Tuesday, 30 November 2004|publisher=Houses of the Oireachtas|accessdate=2009-06-06|date=2004-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was made a Freeman of the city of Limerick.

In 2005, he donated his personal papers to the [[University of Limerick]].&lt;ref name="rte" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1869">'''Ulick McEvaddy''', a former Irish army officer and native of [[Swinford]] [[County Mayo]]. 

In 1984, along with his brother Desmond McEvaddy, he established Omega Air Inc; a Washington-based US Corporation that specialises in the sale and lease of aircraft. Omega Air has become one of the biggest supplier and traders of [[Boeing 707]] in the world. Today Omega Air has developed into a group of six aviation companies whose services include spare part sales and leasing, engine overhaul and repair, aircraft sales and leasing, air-to-air re-fuelling and re-engineering of Boeing 707 series aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castlebar.ie/Business/IWAK_Appointments.shtml New Appointments to Board of Ireland West Airport Knock]&lt;/ref&gt;

He owns {{convert|140|acre|km2}} of land west of [[Dublin Airport]], and wishes to build a competing terminal on that land. The [[Dublin Airport Authority]] (DAA) have stated that they would not allow a competing terminal access to the Runway at Dublin Airport. 

Other parties calling out for a second competing Terminal include [[Michael O'Leary (Ryanair)|Michael O'Leary]], the CEO of [[Ryanair]]. O'Leary has been known to be in strong opposition to the DAA ( previously known as [[Aer Rianta]]), on various issues. 

McEvaddy is one of the main contributors to the controversial anti-[[Lisbon Treaty]] campaign group [[Libertas Party|Libertas]] in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2008/0420/lisbon.html McEvaddy joins Lisbon 'no' campaign] RTÉ News (20/04/2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Virtonomics'' resembles [[Trevor Chan]]'s business simulation game ''[[Capitalism 2]]''.&lt;ref name="InternetRU2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BusinessPress2008"/&gt; It simulates the basic principles and processes of businesses in a competitive environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no predefined victory or failure conditions, and the game does not end. Players define their own end goals for the game, and try achieve them using strategy and tactics. Typically, the main goal is to build a successful business amidst competition.

''Virtonomics'' is a multiplayer game, and players mainly interact with other players as well as with a computer-controlled opponent. It is turn-based game, and each turn lasts a fixed length of time. Generally, turns are a day long, and for a regular player, the game required 15 to 60 minutes a day. In 2014, the developers released a "fast realm", a [[game server]] where turns were an hour long; this was designed for players in short-term business training.

Currently Virtonomics has six realms: Vera, Olga, Mary, Lien, Fast and Anna.

In the game, players may engage in agriculture, exploitation of natural resources, manufacturing, retail, [[foreign exchange market]] trade, finance, personnel management, marketing, logistics, scientific research and other business processes.&lt;ref name="Bellotti2014"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Serious games and the development of an entrepreneurial mindset in higher education engineering students|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875952114000214|first1=F|last1=Bellotti|first2=R|last2=Berta|first3=A|last3=De Gloria|first4=E|last4=Lavagnino|first5=A|last5=Antonaci|first6=F|last6=Dagnino|first7=M|last7=Ott|first8=M|last8=Romero|first9=M|last9=Usart|first10=I.S.|last10=Mayer|date=2014|volume=5|issue=4|journal=[[Entertainment Computing]]|doi=10.1016/j.entcom.2014.07.003|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Virtonomics'' is developed by GamerFlot Trading Ltd. A prototype of ''Virtonomics'' called ''Money Mania'' was released in 2004, and it ran as a non-commercial project for a few years. On 11 December 2006, ''Money Mania'' was renamed ''Virtonomics'', and released in the Russian language. The game was named by ''[[Game World Navigator]]'' as the best economic online game of 2007.&lt;ref name="InternetRU2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internet.ru/news/2008-01-18223|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008150820/http://www.internet.ru/news/2008-01-18223|date=2008-01-29|archivedate=2009-10-08|script-title=ru:Экономическая онлайн-игра "Виртономика" названа лучшей игрой 2007 года|trans-title=Economic online game "Virtonomica" named best game of 2007|publisher=[[Mail.Ru]]|language=Russian|accessdate=2010-03-07|title=Archived copy|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BusinessPress2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesspress.ru/newspaper/article_mId_21961_aId_441881.html |script-title=ru:"ВИРТОНОМИКА" – ЛУЧШАЯ БРАУЗЕРНАЯ ИГРА!|trans-title="Virtonomics" - the best browser game!|publisher=[[Alliance Media National Business Partnership]]|language=Russian|work=[[Business Press (Alliance Media)]]|date= |accessdate=2010-03-07|archivedate=2014-07-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718202507/http://businesspress.ru/newspaper/article_mId_21961_aId_441881.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chinarova2006"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Catherine|last=Chinarova|page=91|title=Бизнесмен играющий|trans-title=Business Gaming|date=2006|volume=36|issue=24|accessdate=2016-01-05|url=http://b-mag.ru/PDFs/Regions/2006/2006_12_SAMARA_24.pdf|deadurl=no|archivedate=2016-01-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102221534/http://b-mag.ru/PDFs/Regions/2006/2006_12_SAMARA_24.pdf|language=Russian|work=[[Бизнес-журнал]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game entered the global market in 2009 with a [[freemium]] model, and was translated to several other languages.

'''Étienne Nzabonimana''' (born 1950), formerly a [[small business]]man in [[Kirwa, Rwanda]], was convicted in [[Belgium]] on June 29, 2005 for his role in the [[Rwandan genocide]] of 1994.  Specifically, eyewitnesses argued that he was a leader of the [[Kibungo Club]], which was allegedly planning the genocide in advance, and that he had overseen certain [[massacre]]s in the [[Kibungo]] region.  Prosecutors argued that he and his half-brother, [[Samuel Ndashyikirwa]], provided [[vehicle]]s to Rwandan soldiers along with [[weapon]]s and [[beer]].  Found guilty of aiding [[Hutu]] militias in killing 50,000 [[Tutsi]]s and moderate [[Hutu]]s, he will serve 12 years in prison, while his half-brother will serve ten.
