'''Agent Smith''' is a fictional character and the primary [[antagonist]] in [[The Matrix (franchise)|''The Matrix'' franchise]]. He is portrayed by [[Hugo Weaving]] (and briefly by [[Ian Bliss]]) in the films and voiced by [[Christopher Corey Smith]] in ''[[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]''.

In 2008, Agent Smith was selected by ''[[Empire Magazine]]'' as the 84th Greatest Movie Character of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/100-greatest-movie-characters/default.asp?c=84 |title=The 100 Greatest Movie Characters&amp;#124; 84. Agent Smith &amp;#124; Empire |publisher=www.empireonline.com |date=2006-12-05 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Weaving reprised the role for a [[General Electric]] advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/04/13/a-general-electric-commercial-set-in-the-world-of-the-matrix/|title=Agent Smith Returns – A General Electric Commercial Set In The World Of The Matrix|work=bleedingcool.com|last=Connelly|first=Brendon|date=April 13, 2013|accessdate=April 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Smith began as an [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agent]], an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] [[Computer program|program]] in the [[Matrix (fictional universe)|Matrix]] programmed to keep order within the system by terminating human [[simulacrum|simulacra]] which would bring instability to the [[simulated reality]], as well as any rogue programs that no longer serve a purpose to the Machine collective. To this end, Smith and his fellow Agents possess a number of superhuman attributes from their ability to bend the rules of the Matrix. Smith manifests his physical form by [[spirit possession|inhabiting and overwriting]] the simulated [[Human body|body]] of a human wired into the Matrix; by moving from body to body, he can reform himself if he is "killed" (which only kills the host body) and appear virtually anywhere. He can overcome the limitations of gravity and the human body, giving him speed and strength sufficient to [[bullet time|dodge bullets flawlessly]], [[Punch (combat)|punch]] through concrete with his bare hands, and jump impossible distances. He and other Agents wear earpieces that allow them to communicate with each other instantaneously and perceive the actions of other humans wired into the Matrix via a type of shared consciousness. When Agent Smith removes his earpiece during the first film, he is left unaware of the attack on the building in which he is holding Morpheus. Smith is armed in the first film with the [[Desert Eagle]], chambered for high-caliber [[.50 Action Express|.50 AE]] ammunition, as is standard with all Agents within the Matrix.

At the end of the first film, Smith appears to have been deleted by Neo. However, in the sequels, Smith is revealed to have been linked to Neo, which enabled him to resist being sent to the system source where destroyed programs are permanently deleted. No longer an Agent, Smith is liberated from the Machines' control and exists as a renegade program that manifests himself akin to a self-replicating [[computer virus]] compared to his original Agent-based ability to inhabit a single body wired into the Matrix. Smith gains the power to copy his physical form onto any entity in the Matrix by phasing his hand into their body and spreading a black liquid that transforms them into a copy of himself, resulting in an ever-growing army of Smiths [[group mind (science fiction)|connected by a single consciousness]]. By copying himself onto a human [[redpill]] in the process of disconnecting from the Matrix, Smith overwrites their consciousness and exists in the outside world. This is seen when Smith takes over [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]]'s body in ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''; however, he is repelled when he attempts to do the same to [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] and [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]. Smith's real power comes from his ability to absorb memories and powers from his victims, human and program alike, culminating in him taking over the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]] and fighting Neo in the final battle of the Matrix series.

==Design==
[[File:Warner Brothers VIP studio tour - Matrix mannequins (2862323128).jpg|thumb|right|220px|Smith and other Agents as [[mannequin]]s]]
All Agents (other than Agents Perry and Pace from ''[[The Matrix Online]]'' game) are [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] males, as opposed to the population of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]], which contains people of many ethnic groups. Agents wear rectangular sunglasses and dark green business suits; after Smith loses his status as an Agent, his suit turns black and his sunglasses take on an angled contour that approximates the rounded shape of the ones Neo wears. In contrast to the other Agents who show apathy toward the human race, Smith harbors an acute disgust with humanity. In the first film, he expresses a desire to leave the Matrix to escape its repulsive taint, and reasons that with Zion destroyed his services will no longer be required, allowing him in some sense to 'leave' the Matrix. This at least partially explains his extreme antagonism towards Neo, who fights relentlessly to save Zion.

Other Agents have common [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] names like [[Brown (surname)|Brown]], [[Jones (surname)|Jones]], and [[Thompson (surname)|Thompson]]. It was mentioned in the Philosopher Commentary on the DVD collection that the names of [[Smith (surname)|Smith]], Brown, and Jones may be endemic to the system itself, demonstrating a very "robotic" mindset on the part of the Machines.

Neo's solitary role as the One is contrasted by Smith, who, by replicating himself, becomes "the many". When Neo asks the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]] about Smith, the Oracle explains that Smith is Neo's opposite and his negative.

Unlike the other characters in ''The Matrix'', Smith almost always refers to Neo as "Mr. Anderson". He calls him "Neo" only once in each part of the trilogy: the first time when he is interviewing Neo about his double life, the second when he is dropping off an Agent earplug in a package for Neo, and the third when he is repeating a line of his vision to Neo.

Weaving said of the film series in 2003 that it was always going to be a trilogy, and that as Neo's nemesis, Smith was always going to be there, describing Smith as "more of a free agent" later on in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spelling|first1=Ian|title=Lord of the trilogies|work=Reading Eagle|date=7 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==
From the start it is evident that Agent Smith is significantly stronger, smarter, and more individualistic than other Agents. While other agents rarely act without consulting each other via their earpieces, to the point where they often finish each other's sentences, Smith is usually the one giving orders or using his earpiece to gather information for his own ends. Smith also appears to be the leader of other Agents in the first film, as he has the authority to launch Sentinel attacks in the real world. As with other Agents, Smith generally approaches problems through a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view but, if necessary, will also act with brute force and apparent rage, especially when provoked by Neo.

The earpieces represent some form of control mechanism by the machines. It is notable that when he is interrogating Morpheus, he sends the other agents from the room, then removes his earpiece, releasing himself from the link to the machines before expressing his opinion of humanity. Early in the second film, Smith's earpiece is sent to Neo in an envelope as a message from Smith, representing Smith's newfound freedom.

Agent Smith complains to Morpheus that the Matrix and its inhabitants smell disgusting, "if there is such a thing [as smell]". Smith has an open hatred of humans and their weakness of the flesh. He compares humanity to a [[virus]], a disease organism that would replicate uncontrollably and eventually destroy their environment were it not for the machine intelligences keeping them in check. Ironically, Smith eventually becomes a computer virus, multiplying until he has overrun the entire Matrix.

At the same time, Smith develops an animosity towards the Matrix itself, feeling that he is as much a prisoner of it as the humans he is tasked with controlling. He later develops an immense and increasingly open desire for the destruction of both mankind and machines.

He was also shown to be a [[nihilism|nihilist]], which eventually culminates in his statement that the purpose of life is to end, and crediting Neo's life for his determining this.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''&lt;br&gt;'''Agent Smith:''' I must thank you [Neo]. After all, it was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to ''end.''&lt;/ref&gt; During his final showdown with Neo, Smith angrily dismisses causes such as freedom, truth, peace, and love as simply human attempts to justify a meaningless and purposeless existence, and is completely unable to comprehend why Neo continues to fight him despite the knowledge that he cannot win.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]''&lt;br&gt;'''Agent Smith:''' Why, Mr. Anderson? Why, why? Why do you do it? Why? Why get up? Why keep fighting? Do you believe you're fighting for something, for more than your survival? Can you tell me what it is, do you even know? Is it freedom or truth, perhaps peace - could it be for love? Illusions, Mr. Anderson, vagaries of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose! And all of them as artificial as the Matrix itself. Although, only a human mind could invent something as insipid as love. You must be able to see it, Mr. Anderson, you must know it by now! You can't win, it's pointless to keep fighting! Why, Mr. Anderson, why?! why do you persist?! / '''Neo:''' Because I choose to.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wachowskis]] have commented that Smith's gradual humanization throughout ''The Matrix'' is a process intended to mirror and balance Neo's own increasing power and understanding of the machine world.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

A writer at ''The Guardian'' commented that Smith seems to enjoy his job too much.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/09/hugo-weaving-the-matrix-agent-smith-why-id-like-to-be&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character history==
===''The Matrix''===
In the first film, Smith is one of the three Agents sent to deal with Morpheus. After Neo is successfully removed from the Matrix, Smith arranges Morpheus' capture by bribing [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disillusioned member of Morpheus' crew, with reintegration into The Matrix. When Neo manages to free Morpheus, Smith and his fellow Agents engage in a lengthy cross-town chase. He and Neo fight, with Smith dominating most of the fight. Shortly after Neo escapes the fight, Smith guns him down. Neo revives, realizes his power as the One, and enters Smith, to destroy him from within.

===''The Matrix Reloaded''===
As a result of his contact with Neo from the first film, Smith is "unplugged" in the second film, no longer an Agent of the system but a "free man". This is signified by the lack of an earpiece, which he sends to Neo in an envelope as a message early in the film. His appearance has changed in the second film as well; his sunglasses now have an angular shape different from the Agents' oblong lenses, approximating the shape of the ones Neo wears. His suit color, as opposed to the greenish tint from the first film, is now jet black. He still possesses the abilities of an Agent, but instead of being able to jump from one human to another, he is able to copy himself over any human or program in the Matrix through direct contact; this includes humans wired into the Matrix, non-Agent programs with human forms, [[redpill]]s, and other Agents. Smith retains the memories and abilities, if any, of the one over which he copies himself. This ability is much like how a virus replicates, creating an ironic contrast with the first film, where Smith likens humanity to a virus.

He makes the claim that Neo has set him free. However, he believes there is an unseen purpose that still binds him to Neo. He tries to copy his programming onto Neo, but when this fails, he and dozens of his clones attack him, forcing Neo to flee. Later, he and his clones try to stop Neo from reaching the machine mainframe, without success.

Smith copies himself onto Bane ([[Ian Bliss]]), a crew member of the [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] hovercraft ''Caduceus''. While waiting to leave the Matrix with a message from [[Oracle (The Matrix)|The Oracle]], Bane is attacked and overwritten by Smith, who then takes control of his body in the real world. Smith tests his control over the body by making Bane cut his own arm, in preparation for an assassination attempt on Neo that he quickly abandons. He later sabotages the Zion fleet's defense of the city by triggering one ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] weapon too early, knocking out the other ships and allowing the Sentinels to overrun them.

===''The Matrix Revolutions''===
[[File:Smithposter.jpg|thumb|upright|Movie poster for ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', featuring some of the numerous copies of Smith]]

By the start of the third film, Smith has managed to copy himself over nearly every humanoid in the Matrix, giving him complete control over the "Core Network" (the underlying foundation of the inner workings of the Matrix), thus rendering him immutable by even the Machines themselves. The Oracle explains to Neo that he and Smith have become equal in power and that Smith is Neo's negative, a result of the Matrix's equation trying to balance itself. She tells Neo that Smith will destroy both the Matrix and the real world unless he is stopped. Smith soon assimilates the Oracle, gaining her power of [[foresight (psychology)|foresight]], or [[omniscience]], and later manifests reality-bending powers equivalent to Neo's, such as the ability to fly. Meanwhile, in the real world, Bane (now under Smith's control) stows away on a ship being used by Neo and Trinity and tries to kill them both. Neo is blinded in the fight, but discovers that he can now sense Smith's essence acutely enough to land a blow that kills Bane.

Near the climax of the film, Neo offers a deal with the Machines to get rid of Smith in exchange for Zion's safety, warning them that Smith is beyond their control and will eventually spread to the machine city, which will result in destruction of both mankind and machines. Knowing that Neo is right, the Machines agree to his terms and command all Sentinels attacking Zion to stand down and wait for orders. They later give Neo a connection to enter the Matrix to stop Smith on their behalf. Although the Matrix is now populated exclusively by Smith and his clones, the Smith that has obtained the Oracle's powers battles Neo alone; as he explains, he has foreseen his victory, and has no need for the help of his copies. The two are almost evenly matched as the fight begins, though Neo's combat abilities seem arguably superior to that of Smith, the latter attacking more out of brute force, rather than the technical skill he displayed in the first film. This lasts, until Neo is able to punch Smith strongly enough to slam him into the street at least 20&amp;nbsp;ft away. As the fight continues, however, it becomes clear that Neo cannot win with his finite stamina against the tireless Smith, who begins to dominate Neo in the fight; by the end of the fight, he is able to brutally beat Neo into near defeat. In the midst of this battle, Smith explains to Neo his final [[nihilism|nihilistic]] revelation: "It was your life that taught me the purpose of all life. The purpose of life is to end."

When Neo is near defeat, Smith demands to know why he continues to fight despite knowing he cannot win. Neo calmly responds, "Because I choose to" and is savagely pummeled by the enraged Smith as a result. Suddenly recognizing the scene from his [[prophecy]], Smith is compelled to deliver the line he said in it: "I say.... Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo." His own words confuse and frighten him, and Neo realizes that he cannot overpower Smith and allows himself to be assimilated. Because Agent Smith has deleted the anomaly (Neo) he no longer has a purpose and must also be deleted. Smith is now directly connected to the Source, the machines are able to destroy all copies of his programming and reboot the Matrix without errors. The process kills Neo, whose body is carried away by the machines, and an uncertain peace is established between Zion and the machine world.

===''The Matrix Online''===
Despite his destruction at the end of the film series, Agent Smith (or at least the remnants of his programming) managed to return and made several appearances inside the movie's official continuation, the [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[The Matrix Online]]''.

The first infection was noted in Machine mission controller Agent Gray, whose background information confirms that he was overwritten by Smith at some point during the timeline of the second and third films. This infection had somehow survived the reboot at the end of the third film and rose to the surface once again during chapter 1.2, The Hunt For Morpheus. The Agent, in both a storyline related mission and live event, showed signs of uncharacteristic speech and emotion and eventually led an assault against Zionist redpills declaring 'their stench unbearable any longer'. As a result of his actions the agent was apprehended by his fellow system representatives and scheduled for a 'thorough code cleansing'. He has shown no signs of direct infection since.   
    
Machine liaison officer DifferenceEngine, following a similar scenario to that of the previous Agent Gray infection, also took on the dialect and emotional characteristics of the famous exile agent. Instead of attacking redpills, this instance insisted on finding 'Mr. Anderson'. In the end, the human/machine head relations liaison, Agent Pace, was made aware of the program's infection and subsequent crusade; she proceeded to lock down his RSI and return his program to the Source for analysis. His subsequent fate is unknown.

The third victim of infection was the notorious bluepill Shane Black. This man was an unfortunate victim of the Smith Virus who, once infected, gained the ability to spread the code to others. This quickly led to a small scale outbreak, with several more bluepills becoming infected and joining forces in their hunt for power. He and the other infected were eventually cleansed and returned to their bluepill lives. Shane Black's troubles continued, as he was one of the bluepills recorded to have first witnessed Unlimited redpills practising their newfound powers at the Uriah wharf. This triggered a resurgence of the memories formed during his Smith infection and he soon became volatile and insane. He is reported to have been mercifully killed shortly afterwards.

The most recent appearance of the Smith virus was during the third anniversary events. The virus manifested itself in the form of black-suited men (although they lacked the distinct likeness of Smith). As redpills began to fight back using specialist code from the Oracle, the virus vanished suddenly, stating that he had obtained a new and more dangerous form. The nature of this form was never revealed. &lt;!--The Matrix Online has closed, so all open storylines will indefinitely remain unresolved.--&gt;

===''The Matrix: Path of Neo''===
''[[The Matrix: Path of Neo]]'', a video game covering the events of the entire film trilogy, features a different ending than that shown in ''The Matrix Revolutions'', with a new final boss: the ''MegaSmith''. The MegaSmith was used for gameplay reasons, because though the Wachowskis thought the [[martyr]] approach suitable for film, they also believed that in an interactive medium such as a video game (based upon the successful completion of goals), this would not work. So, described by the siblings as "A little [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] versus [[Galactus]] action", this character was created to be the more appropriate "final boss" of ''Path of Neo''. The MegaSmith is composed of destroyed buildings, cars, and parts of the road, with the "spectator Smiths" standing around the crater and in the streets acting as the MegaSmith's muscles, resulting in Smith not only becoming the city's people, but the city itself.

After Neo knocks Smith into the crater in the level "Aerial Battle", Smith is sent flying through the ground and up through the street. As Neo relaxes, the surrounding Smiths walk away from the crater. Neo gets out of the crater, and dodges a car which flies through the air and lands in a pile of debris. Neo looks on as Smiths tear up chunks of the road and throw cars into this pile. A truck then speeds into a building and blows it up. Smiths can be seen holding the debris together as it takes on a thirty-story tall humanoid form which is then struck by lightning, powering it up. Neo flies up to watch as the giant humanoid lowers its head onto its shoulders. The giant Smith then pulls a pair of giant Smith Shades from a billboard and puts them on. As an interesting aside, the glasses on the billboard are the same ones Agent Smith wore in the first Matrix film, with the curved nose bar, but when the MegaSmith actually puts them on, they become the ones Agent Smith wears in ''The Matrix Reloaded'' and in ''Revolutions''.

After the fight—consisting of Neo dodging blows and building up power to launch more powerful assaults at MegaSmith, damaging one arm and creating a large hole in his chest—Neo flies straight into MegaSmith's mouth, causing the Smiths throughout the Matrix to overload and explode. The player is then shown a short scene from ''The Matrix: Revolutions'' of the streets shining with light emanating from the destroyed Smiths.

===''The Lego Batman Movie'' (2017)===
Agent Smith briefly appears in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' as one of the captives of the [[Phantom Zone]]. He and his clones appear surveilling [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s vandalized Wayne Island, and later appear as one of the multiple enemies attacking the heroes. Smith's clones also appear as enemies in the ''Lego Batman Movie'' story pack for ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', adapting their role in the film.
His voice actor is uncredited.

==Reception==

Christopher Borrelli praised the writing of Smith, noting that the character "had all the good lines", and praising Weaving's portrayal of the character as showing "refreshingly nihilistic wit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borrelli|first1=Christopher|title=Movie review: The Matrix Revolutions|date=4 November 2003|work=The Toledo Blade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character has been described as a 1950s "organization man", like Sergeant [[Joe Friday]] from ''[[Dragnet (franchise)|Dragnet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Kapell|editor1-first=Matthew|editor2-last=Doty|editor2-first=William G.|title=Jacking in to the Matrix|date=2006|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=9780826419095|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a nod to the fact that both characters are portrayed by Hugo Weaving, a [[Lego]] incarnation of Smith appears as an [[Easter egg]] in a cutscene from ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings (video game)|Lego: The Lord of the Rings]]'' when [[Frodo Baggins]] is introduced to [[Elrond]].

== Context ==
The pro-Russian separatists of the [[War in Donbass]] were the organizers of this trip. There has been conflict between Kiev forces and pro-Russian separatists in the eastern regions in Ukraine, such as Donetsk and [[Luhansk]]. This conflict has caused bloodshed. At the time of Klyan's death, Ukraine was divided between pro-Russians and Ukrainian government supporters.&lt;ref name=washingtontimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=RT /&gt; According to a [[BBC News]] analysis by [[Stephen Ennis]] Klyan's employer has in its reports about Ukraine "sought to further [[demonise]] and [[dehumanise]] the [[Ukrainian army]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/monitoring/how-russian-tv-uses-psychology-over-ukraine How Russian TV uses psychology over Ukraine], [[BBC News]] (4 February 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
Klyan's death was part of a series of journalist deaths in Ukraine. He was the fifth journalist that was killed in the region in 2014.&lt;ref name=theguardian /&gt;&lt;ref name=washingtontimes /&gt;&lt;ref name=RT /&gt;&lt;ref name=independent /&gt; VGTRK lost two journalists and a technician in another incident in Luhansk on June 17.&lt;ref name=vorsputnik /&gt;

Klyan's death, along with other journalists in Ukraine, has caused anger in Moscow, as Moscow has condemned the attacks on it journalists there. Klyan's death also was part of a violation of a  ceasefire agreement.&lt;ref name=Pravda&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.pravda.ru/hotspots/conflicts/30-06-2014/127921-russian_journalist_first_channel-0/ |title=Another Russian journalist killed in shooting near Donetsk |work=[[Pravda.ru]] |date=2014-06-30 |accessdate=2015-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainian soldiers were blamed by the Russian foreign ministry for the attack that occurred. The Russian foreign ministry demanded an investigation into the assault and attack. They demanded a punishment for the ones responsible for everything that happened.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/01/world/europe/ukrainian-president-ends-cease-fire-with-rebels.html?_r=0 |title=Ukrainian President Ends Cease-Fire With Rebels |newspaper=New York Times |first=David M. |last=Herszenhorn |date=June 30, 2014 |accessdate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==
[[Irina Bokova]], director-general of [[UNESCO]], said, "I condemn the murder of Anatoly Klyan. I call on the authorities to conduct an investigation into the murder and bring to account those responsible.
Journalists covering events in Ukraine must have an opportunity to fulfill their professional duty, which is to provide citizens with unbiased information and promote news-based discussions without any fear for their own lives."&lt;ref name=vorsputnik&gt;{{cite news|title=UNESCO chief condemns Russian journalist’s murder in Ukraine |publisher=Voice of Russia (Sputnik News) |date=July 2, 2014 |url=http://in.sputniknews.com/indian.ruvr.ru/news/2014_07_02/UNESCO-chief-condemns-Russian-journalist-s-murder-in-Ukraine-0950/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192224/http://in.sputniknews.com/indian.ruvr.ru/news/2014_07_02/UNESCO-chief-condemns-Russian-journalist-s-murder-in-Ukraine-0950/ |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adalbert''' or '''Albert''' or '''Aleric''' ({{lang-it|Adalberto, Alberto or Alerico}}) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] and [[suburbicarian bishop of Santa Rufina]] elected as [[antipope]] in January 1101 by the imperial party in [[Rome]] following the arrest and imprisonment of [[Antipope Theodoric]].&lt;ref&gt;Imma Penn, ''Dogma Evolution and Papal Fallacies'', (AuthorHouse, 2007), 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by the [[Emperor Henry IV]], the followers of the late [[Antipope Clement III]], who had elected Theodoric, gathered in the Basilica of SS. XII Apostoli to elect Albert in opposition to [[Pope Paschal II]].

{{quote|Again there was a mock election in St. Peter's.  But no sooner did word of what was there being done spread abroad than the whole city was in an uproar, and the crowd rushed to the Basilica.  In great alarm the assembly hastily broke up; but while Albert, the newly elected Antipope, who was the Bishop of Sabina, contrived to make his escape to the Basilica of St. Marcellus, many of his party were seized and were roughly handled.  A sum of money quickly bought Pope Albert from his patron.  He was stripped of the pallium that he had just assumed, put on a horse behind its rider, and taken before the rightful Pope—Pope Paschal II—at the Lateran.  After a short incarceration in a tower, he too was sent to a Monastery and ended his days as a Monk at St. Lawrence's at Aversa.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lives of the Popes in the Middle Ages'' – "The Popes of the Gregorian Renaissance, St Leo IX to Honorius II — 1049–1130"; Vol. VIII 1099 – 1130, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10536">The '''beheading of Bhausaheb Maruti Talekar''' by Pakistani soldiers and over two-dozen [[HuJI]] terrorists led by [[Ilyas Kashmiri]] happened in the [[Rajouri]] district of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[India]] on 27 February 2000. Talekar was an Indian soldier on guard duty at the Ashok Listening Post which is surrounded on three sides by Pakistani posts. His post was attacked under the cover of mortar and rocket fire from Pakistani troops in which all seven soldiers on duty from the [[Maratha Light Infantry|17 Maratha Light Infantry]] battalion were killed. Talekar was beheaded and his severed head was carried across the [[line of control]].

After the beheading of Talekar, allegations of other incidents of [[Decapitation|beheading]] by both countries have frequently been reported.

==Biography of Talekar==
Talekar was a resident of Kolgaon village in [[Ahmednagar district]], [[Maharashtra]], India. He was the son of daily laborers and had studied till the 10th grade before joining the army. He was unmarried and 24 years old at the time of his death. According to natives of his village, the family of Talekar did not knew that he was beheaded. The army declined the Talekar's sister request to see his face.&lt;ref name="TIE0902"/&gt; His last rites were performed at his village.&lt;ref name="TIE0902"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TIE09"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
===Ilyas Kashmiri===
{{main|Ilyas Kashmiri}}
Pakistani media published the photographs of Ilyas Kasmiri carrying the severed head of Talekar.&lt;ref name="TH01"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Swami|first1=Praveen|title=Pakistan's Kashmiri problem|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/pakistans-kashmiri-problem/article2094016.ece|accessdate=30 September 2016|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also reported that the then president of Pakistan Gen.

===The inquiry against the commanding officer===
The commanding officer of the unit was [[Colonel]] Sandes. He had communicated to the superiors seeking permission to shift the Ashok listening post because of the possibility of a sneaking attack such as the one which happened on the 27 February 2000, but he was denied permission. He faced a court of inquiry after the incident which exonerated him, but his superiors had reported that colonel Sandes was unfit for commanding a unit. The colonel had to fight a legal battle to be eligible for promotion. Sandes was promoted to the rank of [[Brigadier]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="ToI02"/&gt;

===Talekar's memory===
The army took up the responsibility of the education of his sister after the incident. His family continues to receive a [[pension]] of {{INR}}10,000 per month. A sum of 12 lakh rupees was given to Talekar's family as compensation.&lt;ref name="TIE0902"/&gt;

In his memory, a community hall was built in his village. His sister is pursuing{{when|date=October 2016}} the hope to start a school for special children in his memory.&lt;ref name="TIE0902"/&gt;

===Similar incidents===
Since the torture and murder of [[Saurabh Kalia]] during the Kargil war in the custody of Pakistani troops; many allegations of mistreatment of soldiers by the other side have been reported from Kashmir. The beheading of Talekar happened one year after the [[Kargil war]] ended. Pakistan has filed complaints with the [[United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan]] (UNMOGIP) accusing the Indian Army of beheading at least a dozen Pakistani soldiers since 1998.&lt;ref name="Da01"&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan accuses India of 12 Kashmir beheadings since 1998: report|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/782394/pakistan-accuses-india-of-12-kashmir-beheadings-report|accessdate=4 October 2016|agency=[[AFP news agency|AFP]]|publisher=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; India has denied these allegations.&lt;ref name="TNT01"&gt;{{cite news|title=India rejects Pak’s claim on beheading of troops|url=http://www.freepressjournal.in/india/paks-claim-on-beheading-troops-totally-baseless-says-antony/143860|accessdate=4 October 2016|publisher=[[The Navhind Times]]|date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ET02"&gt;{{cite news|title=India rejects Pakistan's claim on beheading of Troops|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/india-rejects-pakistans-claim-on-beheading-of-troops/articleshow/18270070.cms|accessdate=4 October 2016|agency=[[Press Trust of India|PTI]]|publisher=[[The Economic Times]]|date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one decade before 2013, when Lance Naik Hemraj was beheaded, there have been at least three other such instances of decapitation of Indian soldiers by the Pakistani troops.&lt;ref name="TH02"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Josephy|first1=Josy|title=Back in the day, cross-LoC hit and run was a given|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/back-in-the-day-crossloc-hit-and-run-was-a-given/article9174532.ece|accessdate=3 October 2016|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
The classic symptoms of untreated coeliac disease include pale, loose, and greasy stool ([[steatorrhea|steatorrhoea]]), and weight loss or failure to gain weight. Other common symptoms may be subtle or primarily occur in organs other than the bowel itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schuppan D, Zimmer KP | title = The diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease | journal = Deutsches Arzteblatt International | volume = 110 | issue = 49 | pages = 835–46 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24355936 | pmc = 3884535 | doi = 10.3238/arztebl.2013.0835 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to have coeliac disease without any of the classic symptoms at all.&lt;ref name=Lancet2009/&gt; This has been shown to comprise at least 43% of presentations in children.&lt;ref name=VriezingaSchweizer2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vriezinga SL, Schweizer JJ, Koning F, Mearin ML | title = Coeliac disease and gluten-related disorders in childhood | journal = Nature Reviews.

=== Gastrointestinal ===
The [[diarrhea|diarrhoea]] that is characteristic of coeliac disease is chronic, pale, of large volume, and abnormally bad smelling. [[Abdominal pain]] and cramping, bloatedness with [[abdominal distension]] (thought to be due to fermentative production of bowel gas), and [[mouth ulcer]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ferguson R, Basu MK, Asquith P, Cooke WT | title = Jejunal mucosal abnormalities in patients with recurrent aphthous ulceration | journal = Br Med J | volume = 1 | issue = 6000 | pages = 11–13 | year = 1976 | pmid = 1247715 | pmc = 1638254 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.6000.11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; may be present. As the bowel becomes more damaged, a degree of [[lactose intolerance]] may develop.&lt;ref name=Lancet2009/&gt; Frequently, the symptoms are ascribed to [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS), only later to be recognised as coeliac disease; a small proportion of people with symptoms of IBS have underlying coeliac disease, and screening for coeliac disease is recommended for those with IBS symptoms.&lt;ref name=NICEIBS&gt;{{NICE|61|Irritable bowel syndrome|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coeliac disease leads to an increased risk of both [[adenocarcinoma]] and [[lymphoma]] of the small bowel ([[enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma]] (EATL) or other [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Freeman HJ | title = Adult Celiac Disease and Its Malignant Complications | journal = Gut and Liver | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 237–46 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20431755 | pmc = 2852736 | doi = 10.5009/gnl.2009.3.4.237 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2852736/pdf/gnl-3-237.pdf | format = PDF | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908144738/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2852736/pdf/gnl-3-237.pdf | archivedate = 8 September 2017 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This risk is also higher in first-degree relatives such as siblings, parents and children.

=== Malabsorption-related ===
The changes in the bowel make it less able to absorb nutrients, minerals, and the [[fat-soluble]] vitamins A, D, E, and K.&lt;ref name=Lancet2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Presutti RJ, Cangemi JR, Cassidy HD, Hill DA | title = Celiac disease | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 76 | issue = 12 | pages = 1795–802 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18217518 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/20071215/1795.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The inability to absorb [[carbohydrate]]s and fats may cause [[weight loss]] (or [[failure to thrive]]/stunted growth in children) and [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] or lack of energy.

* [[Calcium in biology|Calcium]] and [[vitamin D]] malabsorption (and compensatory secondary [[hyperparathyroidism]]) may cause [[osteopenia]] (decreased mineral content of the bone) or [[osteoporosis]] (bone weakening and risk of fragility fractures).

=== Miscellaneous ===
Coeliac disease has been linked with a number of conditions. In many cases, it is unclear whether the gluten-induced bowel disease is a causative factor or whether these conditions share a common predisposition.

* [[IgA deficiency]] is present in 2.3% of people with coeliac disease, and in turn this condition features a tenfold increased risk of coeliac disease.

== Pathophysiology ==
Coeliac disease appears to be multifactorial, both in that more than one genetic factor can cause the disease and in that more than one factor is necessary for the disease to manifest in a person.

Almost all people (95%) with coeliac disease have either the variant [[HLA-DQ2]] [[allele]] or (less commonly) the [[HLA-DQ8]] [[allele]].&lt;ref name=VanHeelWest/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Oxford handbook of Clinical Medicine|last = Longmore|first = Murray|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 9780199609628|location = |pages = 280}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, about 20–30% of people without coeliac disease have also inherited either of these alleles.&lt;ref name="pmid17785484"/&gt; This suggests additional factors are needed for coeliac disease to develop; that is, the predisposing HLA risk allele is necessary but not sufficient to develop coeliac disease. Furthermore, around 5% of those people who do develop coeliac disease do not have typical HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 alleles (see below).&lt;ref name=VanHeelWest/&gt;

The two subunits of the HLA-DQ protein are encoded by the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes, located on the short arm of the [[Chromosome 6 (human)|sixth chromosome]].

There are seven [[HLA-DQ]] variants (DQ2 and DQ4–DQ9). Over 95% of people with coeliac have the isoform of DQ2 or DQ8, which is inherited in families. The reason these genes produce an increase in risk of coeliac disease is that the receptors formed by these genes bind to gliadin peptides more tightly than other forms of the antigen-presenting receptor. Therefore, these forms of the receptor are more likely to activate [[T cell|T lymphocytes]] and initiate the autoimmune process.&lt;ref name=VanHeelWest/&gt;

Most people with coeliac bear a two-gene HLA-DQ2 [[haplotype]] referred to as [[HLA-DQ2#DQ2.5|DQ2.5 haplotype]]. This haplotype is composed of two adjacent gene [[allele]]s, DQA1*0501 and [[HLA-DQ2#DQB1*0201|DQB1*0201]], which encode the two subunits, DQ α&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and DQ β&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In most individuals, this DQ2.5 isoform is encoded by one of two chromosomes 6 inherited from parents (DQ2.5cis). Most coeliacs inherit only one copy of this DQ2.5 haplotype, while some inherit it from ''both'' parents; the latter are especially at risk for coeliac disease as well as being more susceptible to severe complications.&lt;ref name="pmid17190762"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jores RD, Frau F, Cucca F, Grazia Clemente M, Orrù S, Rais M, De Virgiliis S, Congia M | title = HLA-DQB1*0201 homozygosis predisposes to severe intestinal damage in celiac disease | journal = Scand.

Some individuals inherit DQ2.5 from one parent and an additional portion of the haplotype (either DQB1*02 or DQA1*05) from the other parent, increasing risk. Less commonly, some individuals inherit the DQA1*05 allele from one parent and the DQB1*02 from the other parent (DQ2.5trans) (called a trans-haplotype association), and these individuals are at similar risk for coeliac disease as those with a single DQ2.5-bearing chromosome 6, but in this instance disease tends not to be familial. Among the 6% of European coeliacs that do not have DQ2.5 (cis or trans) or DQ8 (encoded by the haplotype DQA1*03:DQB1*0302), 4% have the [[HLA-DQ2#DQ2.2 and gluten|DQ2.2]] isoform, and the remaining 2% lack DQ2 or DQ8.&lt;ref name="pmid12651074"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karell K, Louka AS, Moodie SJ, Ascher H, Clot F, Greco L, Ciclitira PJ, Sollid LM, Partanen J | title = HLA types in celiac disease patients not carrying the DQA1*05-DQB1*02 (DQ2) heterodimer: results from the European Genetics Cluster on Celiac Disease | journal = Hum.

One locus, the [[LPP (gene)|LPP]] or lipoma-preferred partner gene, is involved in the adhesion of extracellular matrix to the cell surface, and a minor variant ([[Single nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] = rs1464510) increases the risk of disease by approximately 30%.

The prevalence of coeliac disease genotypes in the modern population is not completely understood. Given the characteristics of the disease and its apparent strong heritability, it would normally be expected that the genotypes would undergo negative selection and to be absent in societies where agriculture has been practised the longest (compare with a similar condition, [[Lactose intolerance]], which has been negatively selected so strongly that its prevalence went from ~100% in ancestral populations to less than 5% in some European countries). This expectation was first proposed by Simoons (1981).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Food, nutrition, and evolution: food as an environmental factor in the genesis of human variability|author1=Walcher, Dwain N.  |author2=Kretchmer, Norman |pages=179–199|publisher=Papers presented at the International Congress of the International Organization for the Study of Human Development, Masson Pub.

=== Prolamins ===
The majority of the proteins in food responsible for the immune reaction in coeliac disease are the [[prolamin]]s. These are storage proteins rich in [[proline]] (''prol-'') and [[glutamine]] (''-amin'') that dissolve in alcohols and are resistant to [[protease]]s and [[peptidase]]s of the gut.&lt;ref name=VanHeelWest/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17960014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Green PH, Cellier C | title = Celiac disease | journal = N.

Membrane leaking permits peptides of gliadin that stimulate two levels of immune response, the innate response and the adaptive (T-helper cell mediated) response. One protease-resistant peptide from α-gliadin contains a region that stimulates lymphocytes and results in the release of [[interleukin-15]]. This [[Gluten immunochemistry#Innate immunity|innate response to gliadin]] results in immune-system signalling that attracts inflammatory cells and increases the release of inflammatory chemicals.&lt;ref name=VanHeelWest/&gt; The strongest and most common adaptive response to gliadin is directed toward an [[Gluten immunochemistry#A2-gliadin|α2-gliadin fragment]] of 33&amp;nbsp;amino acids in length.&lt;ref name=VanHeelWest/&gt;

The response to the 33mer occurs in most coeliacs who have [[HLA-DQ2#DQ2.5 and gluten|a DQ2]] [[wikt:isoform|isoform]]. This peptide, when altered by intestinal transglutaminase, has a high density of overlapping T-cell epitopes. This increases the likelihood that the DQ2 isoform will bind and stay bound to peptide when recognised by T-cells.&lt;ref name="pmid15265905"/&gt; Gliadin in wheat is the best-understood member of this family, but other prolamins exist, and hordein (from barley), secalin (from rye), and avenin (from oats) may contribute to coeliac disease.&lt;ref name=VanHeelWest/&gt;&lt;ref name=Biesiekierski2017 /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16212427"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shan L, Qiao SW, Arentz-Hansen H, Molberg Ø, Gray GM, Sollid LM, Khosla C | title = Identification and analysis of multivalent proteolytically resistant peptides from gluten: implications for celiac sprue | journal = J.

=== Tissue transglutaminase ===
[[File:TG2 bound to gluten peptide mimic.png|thumb|The active form of [[tissue transglutaminase]] (green) bound to a [[gluten]] peptide mimic (blue). {{PDB|3q3z}}]]
[[Anti-transglutaminase antibodies]] to the enzyme [[tissue transglutaminase]] (tTG) are found in the blood of the majority of people with classic symptoms and complete villous atrophy, but only in 70% of the cases with partial villous atrophy and 30% of the cases with minor mucosal lesions.&lt;ref name=LewisScott2006 /&gt; Tissue transglutaminase modifies gluten [[peptide]]s into a form that may stimulate the immune system more effectively.&lt;ref name=VanHeelWest/&gt; These peptides are modified by tTG in two ways, [[deamidation]] or [[transamidation]].&lt;ref name=Skovbjerg&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Skovbjerg H, Norén O, Anthonsen D, Moller J, Sjöström H | title = Gliadin is a good substrate of several transglutaminases: possible implication in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease | journal = Scand J Gastroenterol | volume = 37 | issue = 7 | pages = 812–7 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12190095 | doi = 10.1080/713786534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deamidation is the reaction by which a glutamate residue is formed by cleavage of the epsilon-amino group of a glutamine side chain. Transamidation, which occurs three times more often than deamidation, is the cross-linking of a glutamine residue from the gliadin peptide to a lysine residue of tTg in a reaction that is catalysed by the transglutaminase. Crosslinking may occur either within or outside the active site of the enzyme. The latter case yields a permanently covalently linked complex between the gliadin and the tTg.&lt;ref name=Fleckenstein&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fleckenstein B, Molberg Ø, Qiao SW, Schmid DG, von der Mülbe F, Elgstøen K, Jung G, Sollid LM | title = Gliadin T cell epitope selection by tissue transglutaminase in celiac disease.

Stored biopsies from people with suspected coeliac disease have revealed that [[autoantibody]] deposits in the [[wikt:subclinical|subclinical]] coeliacs are detected prior to clinical disease. These deposits are also found in people who present with other autoimmune diseases, anaemia, or malabsorption phenomena at a much increased rate over the normal population.&lt;ref name=Kaukinen&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaukinen K, Peräaho M, Collin P, Partanen J, Woolley N, Kaartinen T, Nuutinen T, Halttunen T, Mäki M, Korponay-Szabo I | title = Small-bowel mucosal tranglutaminase 2-specific IgA deposits in coeliac disease without villous atrophy: A Prospective and radmonized clinical study | journal = Scand J Gastroenterology | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 564–572 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16036509 | doi = 10.1080/00365520510023422 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Endomysial components of antibodies (EMA) to tTG are believed to be directed toward cell-surface transglutaminase, and these antibodies are still used in confirming a coeliac disease diagnosis.

In a large percentage of people with coeliac, the anti-tTG antibodies also recognise a [[rotavirus]] protein called VP7. These antibodies stimulate [[monocyte]] proliferation, and rotavirus infection might explain some early steps in the cascade of [[White blood cell|immune cell]] proliferation.&lt;ref name="toll-like"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zanoni G, Navone R, Lunardi C, Tridente G, Bason C, Sivori S, Beri R, Dolcino M, Valletta E, Corrocher R, Puccetti A | title = In celiac disease, a subset of autoantibodies against transglutaminase binds toll-like receptor 4 and induces activation of monocytes | journal = PLoS Med | volume = 3 | issue = 9 | pages = e358 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16984219 | pmc = 1569884 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030358}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, earlier studies of rotavirus damage in the gut showed this causes a villous atrophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salim AF, Phillips AD, Farthing MJ | title = Pathogenesis of gut virus infection | journal = Baillière's Clinical Gastroenterology | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 593–607 | year = 1990 | pmid = 1962725 | doi = 10.1016/0950-3528(90)90051-H }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that viral proteins may take part in the initial flattening and stimulate self-crossreactive anti-VP7 production. Antibodies to VP7 may also slow healing until the gliadin-mediated tTG presentation provides a second source of crossreactive antibodies.

Other intestinal disorders may have [[biopsy]] that look like coeliac disease including lesions caused by Candida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Celiac disease: A review|journal=BCMJ|date=September 2001|volume=43|issue=7|pages=390–395|url=http://www.bcmj.org/article/celiac-disease-review#Abstract|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222160458/http://www.bcmj.org/article/celiac-disease-review#Abstract|archivedate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Villous atrophy and malabsorption ===
The inflammatory process, mediated by [[T cell]]s, leads to disruption of the structure and function of the small bowel's mucosal lining and causes malabsorption as it impairs the body's ability to absorb [[nutrient]]s, minerals, and fat-soluble [[vitamin]]s A, D, E, and K from food. Lactose intolerance may be present due to the decreased bowel surface and reduced production of [[lactase]] but typically resolves once the condition is treated.

Alternative causes of this tissue damage have been proposed and involve release of [[interleukin 15]] and activation of the innate immune system by a shorter gluten peptide (p31–43/49). This would trigger killing of [[enterocyte]]s by lymphocytes in the [[epithelium]].&lt;ref name=VanHeelWest/&gt; The villous atrophy seen on biopsy may also be due to unrelated causes, such as [[tropical sprue]], [[giardiasis]] and [[radiation enteritis]]. While positive serology and typical biopsy are highly suggestive of coeliac disease, lack of response to diet may require these alternative diagnoses to be considered.&lt;ref name=AGA/&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
[[Medical diagnosis|Diagnosis]] is often very difficult so that most cases are diagnosed with great delay.&lt;ref name=MatthiasPfeiffer2010&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Matthias T, Pfeiffer S, Selmi C, Eric Gershwin M|title=Diagnostic challenges in celiac disease and the role of the tissue transglutaminase-neo-epitope|journal=Clin Rev Allergy Immunol|volume=38|issue=2–3|pages=298–301|date=April 2010|pmid=19629760|doi=10.1007/s12016-009-8160-z|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several tests that can be used. The level of [[symptom]]s may determine the order of the tests, but ''all'' tests lose their usefulness if the person is already eating a [[gluten-free diet]]. [[Small intestine|Intestinal]] damage begins to heal within weeks of gluten being removed from the diet, and [[antibody]] levels decline over months. For those who have already started on a gluten-free diet, it may be necessary to perform a [[gluten challenge test|rechallenge]] with some gluten-containing food in one meal a day over 6 weeks before repeating the investigations.&lt;ref name="NICEcoeliac"/&gt;

=== Blood tests ===
[[File:ENDOMYSIAL ANTIBODIES.jpg|thumb|[[Immunofluorescence]] staining pattern of endomysial antibodies on a monkey oesophagus tissue sample.]]
[[Serology|Serological]] blood tests are the first-line investigation required to make a diagnosis of coeliac disease. Its sensitivity correlates with the degree of histological lesions. People who present minor damage of the small intestine may have seronegative findings so many patients with coeliac disease often are missed. In patients with villous atrophy, anti-[[endomysium|endomysial]] (EMA) antibodies of the [[immunoglobulin A]] (IgA) type can detect coeliac disease with a [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] and [[sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] of 90% and 99%, respectively.&lt;ref name="pmid20442390"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van der Windt DA, Jellema P, Mulder CJ, Kneepkens CM, van der Horst HE |title=Diagnostic testing for celiac disease among patients with abdominal symptoms: a systematic review |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] |volume=303 |issue=17 |pages=1738–46 |year=2010 |pmid=20442390 |doi=10.1001/jama.2010.549 | quote=Most studies used similar histological criteria for diagnosing celiac disease (Marsh grade ≥III), but the level of damage may vary across populations. Only 4 studies presented the proportion of patients in whom only partial villous atrophy was found (Marsh grade of IIIA), which ranged from 4% to 100%. The presence of positive serum antibodies has been shown to correlate with the degree of villous atrophy, and patients with celiac disease who have less severe histological damage may have seronegative findings. This could be important, especially in primary care, in which levels of mucosal damage may be lower, and consequently, more patients with celiac disease may be missed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Serology]] for [[anti-transglutaminase antibodies]] (anti-tTG) was initially reported to have a higher [[sensitivity and specificity|sensitivity]] (99%) and [[sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] (&gt;90%). However, it is now thought to have similar characteristics to anti-endomysial antibody.&lt;ref name="pmid20442390"/&gt; Both anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies have high sensitivity to diagnose people with classic symptoms and complete villous atrophy, but they are only found in 30–89% of the cases with partial villous atrophy and in less than 50% of the people who have minor mucosal lesions ([[duodenal lymphocytosis]]) with normal villi.&lt;ref name=LewisScott2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=AGA2006 /&gt;

Tissue transglutaminase modifies gluten [[peptide]]s into a form that may stimulate the immune system more effectively.&lt;ref name=VanHeelWest/&gt; These peptides are modified by tTG in two ways, deamidation or transamidation.&lt;ref name="Skovbjerg"/&gt; Modern anti-tTG assays rely on a human [[recombinant DNA|recombinant protein]] as an [[antigen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sblattero D, Berti I, Trevisiol C, Marzari R, Tommasini A, Bradbury A, Fasano A, Ventura A, Not T |title=Human recombinant tissue transglutaminase ELISA: an innovative diagnostic assay for celiac disease |journal=[[The American Journal of Gastroenterology|Am.

An equivocal result on tTG testing should be followed by anti-endomysial antibodies.&lt;ref name=NICEcoeliac/&gt;

Guidelines recommend that a total serum IgA level is checked in parallel, as people with coeliac with IgA deficiency may be unable to produce the antibodies on which these tests depend ("false negative"). In those people, IgG antibodies against transglutaminase (IgG-tTG) may be diagnostic.&lt;ref name="NICEcoeliac"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Korponay-Szabó IR, Dahlbom I, Laurila K, Koskinen S, Woolley N, Partanen J, Kovács JB, Mäki M, Hansson T |title=Elevation of IgG antibodies against tissue transglutaminase as a diagnostic tool for coeliac disease in selective IgA deficiency |journal=Gut |volume=52 |issue=11 |pages=1567–71 |year=2003 |pmid=14570724 |pmc=1773847 |doi=10.1136/gut.52.11.1567 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If all these antibodies are negative, then anti-DGP antibodies (antibodies against deamidated gliadin peptides) should be determined. IgG class anti-DGP antibodies may be useful in people with IgA deficiency. In children younger than two years, anti-DGP antibodies perform better than anti-endomysial and anti-transglutaminase antibodies tests.&lt;ref name=ESPGHAN2012 /&gt;

Because of the major implications of a diagnosis of coeliac disease, professional guidelines recommend that a positive [[blood test]] is still followed by an [[endoscopy]]/[[esophagogastroduodenoscopy|gastroscopy]] and [[biopsy]]. A negative serology test may still be followed by a recommendation for endoscopy and [[duodenum|duodenal]] biopsy if clinical suspicion remains high.&lt;ref name="NICEcoeliac"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AGA/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASPGHAN"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hill ID, Dirks MH, Liptak GS, Colletti RB, Fasano A, Guandalini S, Hoffenberg EJ, Horvath K, Murray JA, Pivor M, Seidman EG |title=Guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of celiac disease in children: recommendations of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition |journal=[[Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition|J.

Historically three other antibodies were measured: anti-[[reticular fiber|reticulin]] (ARA), anti-[[gliadin]] ([[Anti-gliadin antibodies|AGA]]) and anti-endomysial (EMA) antibodies.&lt;ref name="HillNIH"/&gt; ARA testing, however, is not accurate enough for routine diagnostic use.&lt;ref name="pmid23365209"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nandiwada SL, Tebo AE |title=Testing for antireticulin antibodies in patients with celiac disease is obsolete: a review of recommendations for serologic screening and the literature |journal=[[Clinical and Vaccine Immunology|Clin.

Other antibodies such as [[Anti–Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody|anti–Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies]] occur in some people with coeliac disease but also occur in other autoimmune disorders and about 5% of those who donate blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fagoonee S, De Luca L, De Angelis C, Castelli A, Rizzetto M, Pellicano R | title = Anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae as unusual antibodies in autoimmune hepatitis | journal = Minerva Gastroenterologica e Dietologica | volume = 55 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–40 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19212306 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibody testing may be combined with [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]] testing if the diagnosis is unclear. TGA and EMA testing are the most sensitive serum antibody tests, but as a negative HLA-DQ type excludes the diagnosis of coeliac disease, testing also for HLA-DQ2 or DQ8 maximises sensitivity and negative predictive values.&lt;ref name="pmid17785484"/&gt; However, widespread use of HLA typing to rule out coeliac disease is not currently recommended.&lt;ref name="NICEcoeliac"/&gt;

=== Endoscopy ===
[[File:Celiac endo.JPG|thumb|[[Endoscopy|Endoscopic]] still of [[duodenum]] of person with coeliac disease showing scalloping of folds and "cracked-mud" appearance to mucosa]]
[[File:Coeliac Disease.png|thumb|Schematic of the Marsh classification of upper [[jejunum|jejunal]] pathology in coeliac disease.]]
An [[esophagogastroduodenoscopy|upper endoscopy]] with [[biopsy]] of the [[duodenum]] (beyond the [[duodenal bulb]]) or [[jejunum]] is performed to obtain multiple samples (four to eight) from the duodenum. Not all areas may be equally affected; if biopsies are taken from healthy bowel tissue, the result would be a false negative.&lt;ref name="AGA"/&gt; Even in the same bioptic fragment, different degrees of
damage may be present.&lt;ref name=TonuttiBizzaro2014 /&gt;

Most people with coeliac disease have a [[small intestine]] that appears to be normal on endoscopy before the biopsies are examined. However, five findings have been associated with a high specificity for coeliac disease: scalloping of the small bowel folds (''pictured''), paucity in the folds, a [[mosaic]] pattern to the [[mucous membrane|mucosa]] (described as a "cracked-mud" appearance), prominence of the [[submucosa]] [[blood vessel]]s, and a nodular pattern to the mucosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Niveloni S, Fiorini A, Dezi R, Pedreira S, Smecuol E, Vazquez H, Cabanne A, Boerr LA, Valero J, Kogan Z, Mauriño E, Bai JC |title=Usefulness of videoduodenoscopy and vital dye staining as indicators of mucosal atrophy of celiac disease: assessment of interobserver agreement |journal=Gastrointestinal Endoscopy |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=223–29 |year=1998 |pmid=9580349 |doi=10.1016/S0016-5107(98)70317-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

European guidelines suggest that in children and adolescents with symptoms compatible with coeliac disease, the diagnosis can be made without the need for intestinal biopsy if [[Coeliac disease#Blood tests|anti-tTG antibodies]] titres are very high (10 times the upper limit of normal).&lt;ref name=ESPGHAN2012 /&gt;

Until the 1970s, biopsies were obtained using metal capsules attached to a suction device. The capsule was swallowed and allowed to pass into the small intestine. After [[x-ray]] verification of its position, suction was applied to collect part of the intestinal wall inside the capsule. Often-utilised capsule systems were the [[Watson capsule]] and the [[Crosby–Kugler capsule]]. This method has now been largely replaced by [[optical fiber|fibre-optic]] endoscopy, which carries a higher sensitivity and a lower frequency of errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mee AS, Burke M, Vallon AG, Newman J, Cotton PB |title = Small bowel biopsy for malabsorption: comparison of the diagnostic adequacy of endoscopic forceps and capsule biopsy specimens |journal=[[BMJ|The BMJ]] | volume=291 |issue=6498 |pages=769–72 |year=1985 |pmid=3929934 |pmc=1417146 |doi=10.1136/bmj.291.6498.769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Capsule endoscopy]] (CE) allows identification of typical mucosal changes observed in coeliac disease but has a lower sensitivity compared to regular endoscopy and histology. CE is therefore not the primary diagnostic tool for coeliac disease. However, CE can be used for diagnosing T-cell lymphoma, ulcerative jejunoileitis and adenocarcinoma in refractory or complicated coeliac disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Redondo-Cerezo E, Sánchez-Capilla AD, De La Torre-Rubio P, De Teresa J |title=Wireless capsule endoscopy: Perspectives beyond gastrointestinal bleeding |journal=[[World Journal of Gastroenterology|World J.

=== Pathology ===
The classic pathology changes of coeliac disease in the small bowel are categorised by the "Marsh classification":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marsh MN |title=Gluten, major histocompatibility complex, and the small intestine. A molecular and immunobiologic approach to the spectrum of gluten sensitivity ('celiac sprue') |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=102 |issue=1 |pages=330–54 |year=1992 |pmid=1727768 |doi=10.1016/0016-5085(92)91819-p}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marsh stage 0: normal mucosa
* Marsh stage 1: increased number of intra-epithelial [[lymphocyte]]s (IELs), usually exceeding 20 per 100 [[enterocyte]]s
* Marsh stage 2: proliferation of the [[intestinal gland|crypts of Lieberkühn]]
* Marsh stage 3: partial or complete [[intestinal villus|villous]] [[atrophy]] and crypt hypertrophy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Corazza GR, Villanacci V |title=Coeliac disease |journal=[[Journal of Clinical Pathology|J. Clin. Pathol.]] |volume=58 | issue=6 |pages=573–74 |date=1 June 2005 |pmid=15917404 |pmc=1770677 |doi=10.1136/jcp.2004.023978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Marsh stage 4: [[hypoplasia]] of the [[small intestine]] architecture

Marsh's classification, introduced in 1992, was subsequently modified in 1999 to six stages, where the previous stage 3 was split in three substages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oberhuber G, Granditsch G, Vogelsang H |title=The histopathology of coeliac disease: time for a standardized report scheme for pathologists |journal=[[European Journal of Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology|Eur.

* A representing lymphocytic infiltration with normal villous appearance;
* B1 describing partial villous atrophy; and
* B2 describing complete villous atrophy.

The changes classically improve or reverse after [[gluten]] is removed from the diet. However, most guidelines do not recommend a repeat biopsy unless there is no improvement in the symptoms on diet.&lt;ref name="AGA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NASPGHAN"/&gt; In some cases, a deliberate gluten challenge, followed by biopsy, may be conducted to confirm or refute the diagnosis. A normal biopsy and normal serology after challenge indicates the diagnosis may have been incorrect.&lt;ref name="AGA"/&gt;

In untreated coeliac disease, villous atrophy is more common in children younger than three years, but in older children and adults, it is common to find minor intestinal lesions ([[duodenal lymphocytosis]]) with normal [[intestinal villi]].&lt;ref name=RostamiNejadHoggKollars2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=VivasVaquero2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MolinaInfanteSantolaria2015 /&gt;

=== Other diagnostic tests ===
At the time of diagnosis, further investigations may be performed to identify complications, such as [[iron deficiency]] (by [[complete blood count|full blood count]] and iron studies), [[Folate deficiency|folic acid]] and [[Vitamin B12 deficiency|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency]] and [[hypocalcaemia]] (low calcium levels, often due to decreased [[vitamin D]] levels). [[Thyroid function tests]] may be requested during blood tests to identify [[hypothyroidism]], which is more common in people with coeliac disease.&lt;ref name="AFP"/&gt;

[[Osteopenia]] and [[osteoporosis]], mildly and severely reduced bone mineral density, are often present in people with coeliac disease, and investigations to measure bone density may be performed at diagnosis, such as [[dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry]] (DXA) scanning, to identify risk of fracture and need for bone protection medication.&lt;ref name="AGA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFP"/&gt;

=== Gluten withdrawal ===
Although blood antibody tests, biopsies, and genetic tests usually provide a clear diagnosis,&lt;ref name=AGA2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20442390" /&gt; occasionally the response to gluten withdrawal on a [[gluten-free diet]] is needed to support the diagnosis. Currently, [[Gluten challenge test|gluten challenge]] is no longer required to confirm the diagnosis in patients with intestinal lesions compatible with coeliac disease and a positive response to a gluten-free diet.&lt;ref name=AGA2006 /&gt; Nevertheless, in some cases, a gluten challenge with a subsequent biopsy may be useful to support the diagnosis, for example in people with a high suspicion for coeliac disease, without a biopsy confirmation, who have negative blood antibodies and are already on a gluten-free diet.&lt;ref name=AGA2006 /&gt; Gluten challenge is discouraged before the age of 5 years and during [[puberty|pubertal]] growth.&lt;ref name=OntiverosHardy&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ontiveros N, Hardy MY, Cabrera-Chavez F |title=Assessing of Celiac Disease and Nonceliac Gluten Sensitivity |journal=Gastroenterology Research and Practice |volume=2015|pages=1–13 |year=2015 |pmid=26064097 |pmc=4429206 |doi=10.1155/2015/723954 |type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative diagnosis of [[non-celiac gluten sensitivity|non-coeliac gluten sensitivity]] may be made where there is only symptomatic evidence of gluten sensitivity.&lt;ref name=GenuisLobo2014&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Genuis SJ, Lobo RA|title=Gluten sensitivity presenting as a neuropsychiatric disorder|journal=Gastroenterol Res Pract|volume=2014|page=293206|date=2014|pmid=24693281|pmc=3944951|doi=10.1155/2014/293206|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms of people with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity can be similar to those of coeliac disease,&lt;ref name=TonuttiBizzaro2014 /&gt; and improve when gluten is removed from the diet,&lt;ref name="pmid22345659"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ludvigsson JF, Leffler DA, Bai JC, Biagi F, Fasano A, Green PH, Hadjivassiliou M, Kaukinen K, Kelly CP, Leonard JN, Lundin KE, Murray JA, Sanders DS, Walker MM, Zingone F, Ciacci C |title=The Oslo definitions for coeliac disease and related terms |journal=Gut |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=43–52 |date=January 2013 |pmid=22345659 |pmc=3440559 |doi=10.1136/gutjnl-2011-301346 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ElliRoncorni&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elli L, Roncoroni L, Bardella MT|title=Non-celiac gluten sensitivity: Time for sifting the grain |journal=World J Gastroenterol |volume=21|issue=27|pages=8221–6|date=July 2015 |pmid=26217073 |pmc= 4507091 |doi=10.3748/wjg.v21.i27.8221|type= Review }}&lt;/ref&gt; after coeliac disease and [[wheat allergy]] are reasonably excluded.&lt;ref name="FasanoSapone2015"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fasano A, Sapone A, Zevallos V, Schuppan D|title=Nonceliac gluten sensitivity |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=148|issue=6|pages=1195–204|date=May 2015|pmid=25583468 |doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2014.12.049|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Screening ==
There is debate as to the benefits of screening. As of 2017, the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation among those without symptoms.&lt;ref name=USPSTF2017/&gt; In the United Kingdom, the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] (NICE) recommend testing for coeliac disease in first-degree relatives of those with the disease already confirmed, in people with persistent fatigue, abdominal or gastrointestinal symptoms, faltering growth, unexplained weight loss or iron, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, severe mouth ulcers, and with diagnoses of type 1 diabetes, [[Autoimmune thyroiditis|autoimmune thyroid disease]],&lt;ref name=NICEcoeliac/&gt; and with newly diagnosed [[chronic fatigue syndrome]]&lt;ref&gt;{{NICE|53|Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[irritable bowel syndrome]].&lt;ref name=NICEIBS/&gt; [[Dermatitis herpetiformis]] is included in other recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murch S, Jenkins H, Auth M, Bremner R, Butt A, France S, Furman M, Gillett P, Kiparissi F, Lawson M, McLain B, Morris MA, Sleet S, Thorpe M | title = Joint BSPGHAN and Coeliac UK guidelines for the diagnosis and management of coeliac disease in children | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 98 | issue = 10 | pages = 806–11 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23986560 | doi = 10.1136/archdischild-2013-303996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The NICE also recommend offering serological testing for coeliac disease in people with [[metabolic bone disease]] (reduced bone mineral density or [[osteomalacia]]), unexplained neurological disorders (such as [[peripheral neuropathy]] and [[ataxia]]), fertility problems or recurrent [[miscarriage]], persistently raised liver enzymes with unknown cause, dental enamel defects and with diagnose of [[Down syndrome]] or [[Turner syndrome]].&lt;ref name=NICEcoeliac/&gt;

=== Diet ===
{{Main|Gluten-free diet}}
At present, the only effective treatment is a lifelong [[gluten-free diet]].&lt;ref name=Kupper/&gt; No medication exists that prevents damage or prevents the body from attacking the gut when gluten is present. Strict adherence to the diet helps the intestines heal, leading to resolution of all symptoms in most cases and, depending on how soon the diet is begun, can also eliminate the heightened risk of osteoporosis and intestinal cancer and in some cases sterility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Treem WR | title = Emerging concepts in celiac disease | journal = Curr Opin Pediatr | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 552–9 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15367850 | doi = 10.1097/01.mop.0000142347.74135.73 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The diet can be cumbersome; failure to comply with the diet may cause relapse.

[[Dietitian]] input is generally requested to ensure the person is aware which foods contain gluten, which foods are safe, and how to have a balanced diet despite the limitations. In many countries, gluten-free products are available on [[Medical prescription|prescription]] and may be reimbursed by [[health insurance]] plans.

== History ==
Humans first started to cultivate grains in the [[Neolithic]] period (beginning about 9500 BCE) in the [[Fertile Crescent]] in Western Asia, and it is likely that coeliac disease did not occur before this time. [[Aretaeus of Cappadocia]], living in the second century in the same area, recorded a malabsorptive syndrome with chronic diarrhoea, causing a debilitation of the whole body.&lt;ref name="Aretaeus"/&gt; His "Cœliac Affection" (''coeliac'' from Greek κοιλιακός ''koiliakos'', "abdominal") gained the attention of Western medicine when [[Francis Adams (translator)|Francis Adams]] presented a translation of Aretaeus's work at the Sydenham Society in 1856. The patient described in Aretaeus' work had stomach pain and was atrophied, pale, feeble and incapable of work. The diarrhoea manifested as loose stools that were white, malodorous and flatulent, and the disease was intractable and liable to periodic return. The problem, Aretaeus believed, was a lack of heat in the stomach necessary to digest the food and a reduced ability to distribute the digestive products throughout the body, this incomplete digestion resulting in the diarrhoea. He regarded this as an affliction of the old and more commonly affecting women, explicitly excluding children. The cause, according to Aretaeus, was sometimes either another chronic disease or even consuming "a copious draught of cold water."&lt;ref name="Aretaeus"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Losowsky/&gt;

The [[pediatrics|paediatrician]] [[Samuel Gee]] gave the first modern-day description of the condition in children in a lecture at [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street]], London, in 1887. Gee acknowledged earlier descriptions and terms for the disease and adopted the same term as Aretaeus (coeliac disease). He perceptively stated: "If the patient can be cured at all, it must be by means of diet." Gee recognised that milk intolerance is a problem with coeliac children and that highly starched foods should be avoided. However, he forbade rice, sago, fruit and vegetables, which all would have been safe to eat, and he recommended raw meat as well as thin slices of toasted bread. Gee highlighted particular success with a child "who was fed upon a quart of the best Dutch [[mussel]]s daily." However, the child could not bear this diet for more than one season.&lt;ref name=Losowsky/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gee | first = SJ | year = 1888 | title = On the coeliac affection | journal = St Bartholomew's Hospital Report | volume = 24 | pages = 17–20 | url = http://web2.bium.univ-paris5.fr/livanc/?cote=epo0466&amp;p=1&amp;do=page | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231536/http://web2.bium.univ-paris5.fr/livanc/?cote=epo0466&amp;p=1&amp;do=page | archivedate = 26 September 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Archibald Herter (physician)|Christian Archibald Herter]], an American physician, wrote a book in 1908 on children with coeliac disease, which he called "intestinal [[infantilism (disorder)|infantilism]]." He noted their growth was retarded and that fat was better tolerated than carbohydrate.

=== Christian churches and the Eucharist ===
Speaking generally, the various denominations of Christians celebrate a [[Eucharist]] in which a wafer or small piece of [[sacramental bread]] from wheat bread is blessed and then eaten. A typical wafer weighs about half a gram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eden.co.uk/shop/peoples-alter-breads-single-cross-sealed-edge-white-125972.html One on-line site sells 1200 wafers weighing a total of 523 g] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916215312/http://www.eden.co.uk/shop/peoples-alter-breads-single-cross-sealed-edge-white-125972.html |date=16 September 2011 }}. Eden.co.uk (31 July 2013). Retrieved on 3 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wheat flour]] contains around 10 to 13% gluten, so a single communion wafer may have more than 50&amp;nbsp;mg of gluten, an amount that harms many people with coeliac, especially if consumed every day (see ''Diet'' above).

Many Christian churches offer their communicants gluten-free alternatives, usually in the form of a rice-based cracker or gluten-free bread. These include the [[United Methodist Church|United Methodist]], [[Christian Reformed Church in North America|Christian Reformed]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]], the Anglican Church (Church of England, UK) and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]]. [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] may receive from the Chalice alone, or ask for gluten-reduced hosts; gluten-free ones however are not considered to still be wheat bread, and hence invalid matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicceliacs.org/Bishops.html Statement by the National Conference of Catholic bishops on the use of low gluten hosts at Mass] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716100106/http://www.catholicceliacs.org/Bishops.html |date=16 July 2013 }}. ''BCL Newsletter''. November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Roman Catholic position ====
Roman Catholic [[doctrine]] states that for a valid [[Eucharist]], the bread to be used at Mass must be made from wheat. Low-gluten [[Host (Holy Communion)|hosts]] meet all of the Catholic Church's requirements, but they are not entirely gluten free. Requests to use rice wafers have been denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author = Associated Press | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5762478/ | title = Girl with digestive disease denied Communion | work = MSNBC | publisher = Microsoft | date = 8 December 2004 | accessdate = 30 May 2006 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060810183647/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5762478/ | archivedate = 10 August 2006 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue is more complex for priests. As a celebrant, a priest is, for the fullness of the sacrifice of the Mass, absolutely required to receive under both species. On 24 July 2003, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stated, "Given the centrality of the celebration of the Eucharist in the life of a priest, one must proceed with great caution before admitting to Holy Orders those candidates unable to ingest gluten or alcohol without serious harm."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict XVI|Ratzinger, Joseph]] (24 July 2003). ''Prot. 89/78-174 98''. [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]].

By January 2004, extremely low-gluten Church-approved hosts had become available in the United States, Italy and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/featured/headline.php?ID=1340 |title=Liturgy: Gluten-free Hosts |accessdate=17 June 2007 |last=McNamara |first=Father Edward |date=15 September 2004 |work=Catholic Online |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929130110/http://www.catholic.org/featured/headline.php?ID=1340 |archivedate=29 September 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2017, the Vatican still outlawed the use of gluten-free bread for Holy Communion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/08/vatican-outlaws-use-gluten-free-bread-holy-communion/ |title=Vatican outlaws use of gluten free bread for Holy Communion |accessdate=3 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804012531/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/08/vatican-outlaws-use-gluten-free-bread-holy-communion/ |archivedate=4 August 2017  |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=2017-07-08 |last1=Millward |first1=David }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Passover ===
The Jewish festival of [[Passover|Pesach]] (Passover) may present problems with its obligation to eat [[matzo]], which is unleavened bread made in a strictly controlled manner from wheat, barley, [[spelt]], oats, or rye. This rules out many other grains that are normally used as substitutes for people with gluten sensitivity, especially for [[Ashkenazi Jews]], who also avoid rice. Many kosher-for-Passover products avoid grains altogether and are therefore gluten-free. [[Potato starch]] is the primary starch used to replace the grains.

== Research directions ==
The search for environmental factors that could be responsible for genetically susceptible people becoming intolerant to gluten has resulted in increasing research activity looking at gastrointestinal infections.&lt;ref name="pmid27840181"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kemppainen KM, Lynch KF, Liu E, Lönnrot M, Simell V, Briese T, Koletzko S, Hagopian W, Rewers M, She JX, Simell O, Toppari J, Ziegler AG, Akolkar B, Krischer JP, Lernmark Å, Hyöty H, Triplett EW, Agardh D | title = Factors That Increase Risk of Celiac Disease Autoimmunity After a Gastrointestinal Infection in Early Life | journal = Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology : The Official Clinical Practice Journal of the American Gastroenterological Association | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 694–702.e5 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 27840181 | pmc = 5576726 | doi = 10.1016/j.cgh.2016.10.033 | display-authors = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research published in April 2017 suggests an often symptomless infection with a common strain of [[reovirus]] can increase sensitivity to foods such as gluten.&lt;ref name="Verdu_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verdu EF, Caminero A | title = How infection can incite sensitivity to food | journal = Science | volume = 356 | issue = 6333 | pages = 29–30 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28385972 | doi = 10.1126/science.aan1500  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various other approaches are being studied that would reduce the need of dieting. All are still under development, and are not expected to be available to the general public for a while.&lt;ref name=VanHeelWest/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24199026"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Freeman HJ |title=Non-dietary forms of treatment for adult celiac disease |journal=World Journal of Gastrointestinal Pharmacology and Therapeutics |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=108–12 | date=November  2013 |pmid=24199026 |pmc=3817285 |doi=10.4292/wjgpt.v4.i4.108 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24882720"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vanga RR, Kelly CP |title=Novel therapeutic approaches for celiac disease |journal=Discovery Medicine |volume=17 |issue=95 |pages=285–93 | date=May  2014 |pmid=24882720 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three main approaches have been proposed as new therapeutic modalities for coeliac disease: gluten detoxification, modulation of the [[intestinal permeability]], and modulation of the immune response.&lt;ref name="Castillo-etal-2015"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Castillo NE, Theethira TG, Leffler DA |title=The present and the future in the diagnosis and management of celiac disease |journal=Gastroenterology Report |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=3–11 |year=2015 |pmid=25326000 |pmc=4324867 |doi=10.1093/gastro/gou065 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] wheat species, or wheat species that have been [[plant breeding|selectively bred]] to be minimally immunogenic, may allow the consumption of wheat. This, however, could interfere with the effects that gliadin has on the quality of dough. Alternatively, gluten exposure can be minimised by the ingestion of a combination of [[enzyme]]s ([[prolyl endopeptidase]] and a barley glutamine-specific [[cysteine endopeptidase]] ([[EP-B2]])) that degrade the putative 33-mer peptide in the [[duodenum]].&lt;ref name=VanHeelWest/&gt;

Alternative treatments under investigation include the inhibition of [[zonulin]], an endogenous signalling protein linked to increased permeability of the bowel wall and hence increased presentation of gliadin to the immune system. One inhibitor of this pathway is [[larazotide acetate]], which is currently scheduled for phase 3 clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.innovatebiopharma.com/inn-202.html|title=Innovate Biopharmaceuticals|website=www.innovatebiopharma.com|access-date=17 April 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418041125/http://www.innovatebiopharma.com/inn-202.html|archivedate=18 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other modifiers of other well-understood steps in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease, such as the action of HLA-DQ2 or tissue transglutaminase and the MICA/NKG2D interaction that may be involved in the killing of enterocytes.&lt;ref name=VanHeelWest/&gt;

Attempts to modulate the immune response with regard to coeliac disease are mostly still in phase I of clinical testing; one agent (CCX282-B) has been evaluated in a phase II clinical trial on the basis of small-intestinal biopsies taken from people with coeliac disease before and after gluten exposure.&lt;ref name="Castillo-etal-2015"/&gt;

Although popularly used as an [[complementary and alternative medicine|alternative treatment]] for people with autism, there is no good evidence that a [[gluten-free diet]] is of benefit.&lt;ref name=Buie&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Buie T |title=The relationship of autism and gluten |journal=Clin Ther |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=578–83 |year=2013 |pmid=23688532 |doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2013.04.011 |type=Review |quote=At this time, the studies attempting to treat symptoms of autism with diet have not been sufficient to support the general institution of a gluten-free or other diet for all children with autism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MariBausetZazpe"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marí-Bauset S, Zazpe I, Mari-Sanchis A, Llopis-González A, Morales-Suárez-Varela M| title = Evidence of the gluten-free and casein-free diet in autism spectrum disorders: a systematic review | journal = J Child Neurol | volume = 29| issue = 12| pages = 1718–27| date = December 2014| pmid = 24789114|doi = 10.1177/0883073814531330| hdl = 10171/37087| hdl-access = free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Millward2008"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Millward C, Ferriter M, Calver S, Connell-Jones G | title=Gluten- and casein-free diets for autistic spectrum disorder | journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev | year= 2008 | issue= 2 | pages= CD003498 | pmid=18425890 | doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003498.pub3 | editor1-last=Ferriter| editor1-first=Michael | pmc=4164915}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the subset of people who have [[non-celiac gluten sensitivity|gluten sensitivity]] there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors.&lt;ref name=Buie /&gt;&lt;ref name=VoltaCaio&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Volta U, Caio G, De Giorgio R, Henriksen C, Skodje G, Lundin KE| title = Non-celiac gluten sensitivity: a work-in-progress entity in the spectrum of wheat-related disorders | journal = Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol | volume = 29| issue = 3| pages = 477–91| date = June 2015| pmid = 26060112 | doi = 10.1016/j.bpg.2015.04.006 | quote= autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been hypothesized to be associated with NCGS [47,48].

"'''Corner of the Eye'''" is an episode of ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' television show. It was first broadcast on 19 May 1995 during the first season.

==Introduction==
A priest begins to see horrific demon creatures amongst the ordinary population.

==Opening narration==
{{cquote|''In a world filled with darkness, Father Anton Jonascu's faith has long been a beacon of light for those in need. But now the good father finds himself at a crossroads, in danger of losing his way.''}}

==Plot==
Father Anton Jonascu ([[Len Cariou]]) begins to have strange hallucinations &amp;mdash; one moment he sees perfectly ordinary-looking people, the next they have changed into terrifying demon creatures. He visits Dr. Pallas ([[Chris Sarandon]]), and a medical scan reveals an inoperable brain-tumour that seems to be the cause of his hallucinations.

Jonascu continues to see the creatures, and finally collapses during a sermon. He returns to the doctor and explains his predicament further. Dr. Pallas injects him with a drug that causes temporary paralysis and explains that he wants to introduce Jonascu to some friends. Pallas opens a door and two of the demon creatures enter... and Pallas also reveals himself as one of them.

After Jonascu has calmed down, Pallas and his associates explain that they are not demons, but alien creatures and that all Earth religions are actually based on teachings from their world. They are here to give the power of healing to humanity, but are unable to reveal themselves because their appearance would terrify humans. One of the aliens gives her life to pass on the gift of healing to Jonascu&amp;mdash;however, Jonascu is asked not to reveal the aliens' presence or the origin of his gift.

Jonascu heals a girl who was badly injured in an accident, and the press finds out making him an instant celebrity. He tries to explain the situation to his skeptical colleague Father Royce ([[Justin Louis]]). After a few days, the aliens request that Jonascu call a worldwide press conference to reveal themselves, and they also tell him that he has a betrayer close to him, Father Royce.

Father Royce overhears the aliens plotting to destroy the atmosphere and discussing how to use Jonascu; but they catch and kill him.

Jonascu finds Royce's body, but is stopped from calling the police by Pallas. Pallas explains that he was not there when Royce died and could not help him... and that he died from an embolism, the same cause of death of another person involved with the aliens.

Jonascu goes to the morgue where Royce's body is kept and uses his healing ability to revive Royce. He then goes to the press conference with Royce to stop the Aliens. Father Jonascu dies after a fight ensues between him and Pallas leaving Royce as the sole human survivor of the power.

==Closing narration==
{{cquote|''From the dawn of time people have believed that angels walk among us. Some believe that demons are also in our midst. But who's to say exactly what form either will take? They could be your spouse, your boss at work, even the person sitting with you... right now.''}}

'''Khaled Mohamed Saeed''' ({{lang-ar|خالد محمد سعيد}} {{IPA-arz|ˈxæːled mæˈħæmmæd sæˈʕiːd|IPA}}; 27 January 1982 – 6 June 2010) was an Egyptian man whose death in police custody in the [[Sidi Gaber]] area of [[Alexandria]] on 6 June 2010 helped incite the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]]. Photos of his disfigured corpse spread throughout online communities and incited outrage over allegations that he was beaten to death by Egyptian security forces. A prominent [[Facebook]] group, "We are all Khaled Said",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/elshaheeed.co.uk|title=Facebook group generated by Khaled Mohamed Saeed's assassination |publisher=Facebook|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; moderated by [[Wael Ghonim]], brought attention to his death and contributed to growing discontent in the weeks leading up to the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/middle-east/anger-on-the-streets-of-cairo|title=Anger on the streets of Cairo|publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)]]|date=13 June 2010|accessdate=13 July 2010}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e41c5faa-3475-11e0-9ebc-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1DfvBdbyf|title=Google worker is Egypt's Facebook hero|date=9 February 2011|work=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, two Egyptian police officers were found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to seven years in prison for beating Saeed to death.&lt;ref name=bbc_convict /&gt; They were granted a retrial and sentenced to ten years in prison on 3 March 2014.&lt;ref name=sentence&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/95747/Egypt/Politics-/Khaled-Saids-killers-sentenced-to-ten-years-in-jai.aspx|title=Khaled Said's killers sentenced to ten years in jail|publisher=''[[Al-Ahram]]''|date=3 March 2014|accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Saeed was raised by his mother and the rest of his extended family after the death of his father when he was young. Showing an interest in computers, he stayed for some time and studied [[computer programming]] in the [[United States]]. He also loved music and had been composing a musical piece before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A with Ali Qassem, uncle of slain youth Khaled Saeed (part one)|author=Lina Attalah|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/53167|newspaper=Almasry Alyoum|date=30 June 2010|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 6 June 2010, Saeed had been sitting on the second floor of a [[cybercafe]]. Two detectives from the [[Sidi Gaber]] police station entered the premises and arrested him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two witnesses affirm Alex victim beaten by police|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/50228|newspaper=[[Almasry Alyoum]]|date=16 June 2010|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple witnesses testified that Saeed was beaten to death by the police, who reportedly hit him and smashed him against objects as he was led outside to their police car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/51909 |title=Anger in Alexandria: 'We're afraid of our own government' |publisher=[[Almasry Alyoum]] |date=25 June 2010 |accessdate=13 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427172608/http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/51909 |archivedate=27 April 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner of the internet cafe in which Saeed was arrested stated that he witnessed Saeed being beaten to death in the doorway of the building across the street after the detectives took him out of the cafe at the owner's request.&lt;ref name="San Diego"/&gt;

In a filmed interview posted online by a leading opposition party, cafe owner Hassan Mosbah described the beating. "They dragged him to the adjacent building and banged his head against an iron door, the steps of the staircase and walls of the building... Two doctors happened to be there and tried in vain to revive him but (the police) continued beating him... They continued to beat him even when he was dead."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=mohamed khalil|title=خالد سعيد الحكاية الكاملة ج3|date=2010-06-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CH2RDwXZjqg|accessdate=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This description given by the owner was confirmed by the [[Egyptian Organization for Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="San Diego"&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt cafe owner describes police beating death|author=Paul Schemm|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/jun/13/egypt-cafe-owner-describes-police-beating-death/ |newspaper=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|date=13 June 2010|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police reported that Saeed suffocated in an attempt to swallow a packet of [[hashish]], a claim supported by two autopsy reports made by Forensic Authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/journalists-protest-state-media-coverage-alexandria-police-killing|title=Journalists protest state media coverage of Alexandria police killing|publisher=[[Almasry Alyoum]]|date=23 June 2010|accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police further stated that Saeed was "wanted for theft and weapons possession and that he resisted arrest".&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news|title=Demonstrators in Egypt rail against brutality, man's death |author=Ben Wedeman |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-06-25/world/egypt.police.beating_1_brutality-mohamed-elbaradei-egyptian?_s=PM:WORLD |newspaper=[[CNN]] |date=25 June 2010 |accessdate=3 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201014256/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-06-25/world/egypt.police.beating_1_brutality-mohamed-elbaradei-egyptian?_s=PM%3AWORLD |archivedate= 1 February 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former chief medical examiner of Egypt, Ayman Fouda, was interviewed about the proper procedure that should have been followed for Saeed's autopsy. He stated that the "mechanics of the injuries" that Saeed had sustained should have been investigated and his brain should have also been tested to see whether he had suffered a [[concussion]]. The medical examiner who conducted the autopsy had done neither.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview: Former chief medical examiner on Khaled Saeed autopsy|author=Dareen Farghaly |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/53003|newspaper=[[Almasry Alyoum]]|date=30 June 2010|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two police officers were later jailed for four days pending questioning on beatings that they allegedly carried out on Saeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/region/egypt/egyptian-protesters-see-policemen-s-jailing-in-activist-s-death-as-a-victory-1.649353|title=Egyptian protesters see policemen's jailing in activist's death as a victory|publisher=[[Gulf News]]|date=2 July 2010|accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed's family members stated that Saeed was "tortured to death for possessing video material that implicates members of the police in a drug deal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police killing sparks Egypt protest|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/06/201061415530298271.html |newspaper=Al Jazeera|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-mortem photographs go viral==
[[File:Khalid-Saeed.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Post mortem]] imagery of Khaled Saeed's corpse in the morgue went viral, becoming "The Face That Launched a Revolution" according to media.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;]]

When Saaed's family visited his body in the morgue, his brother snapped pictures of the corpse using his mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.almasryalyoum.com/node/55686|title=Al-Masry Al-Youm Exclusive: Khaled Saeed Case Investigation|date=12 July 2010|author=Ahmed Shalaby Mostafa ElMarsfawy|work=[[Almasry Alyoum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photo of Saeed's corpse was released onto the internet by Saeed's family in June 2010, causing a large outcry.&lt;ref name="NYTFB"/&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] released a press report about the photo that stated, "Photos of Said's battered and deformed face published on the internet show a fractured skull, dislocated jaw, broken nose, and numerous other signs of trauma." and also that the image clearly showed "strong evidence that plainclothes security officers beat him in a vicious and public manner".&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

==''We are all Khaled Said''==
Among those who saw the photo, was Google marketing executive [[Wael Ghonim]]. Ghonim was located in [[Dubai]] at the time of the incident and decided to create a [[Facebook]] memorial page for Said, called "We are all Khaled Said" within five days of his death. The page attracted hundreds of thousands of followers, becoming Egypt's biggest dissident Facebook page.&lt;ref name="NYTFB"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Facebook and YouTube Fuel the Egyptian Protests|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/world/middleeast/06face.html|date=5 February 2011|last=Preston|first=Jennifer|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NATO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2011/Social_Medias/Egypt_Facebook/EN/index.htm|title= Egypt and Facebook: Time to Update Its Status|work=Nato Review|publisher=[[NATO]]|year=2011|accessdate=19 March 2011|last=Heaven|first= Will}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for Said rapidly spread,&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;&lt;ref name=NATO/&gt; with many Facebook members using his photograph for their own profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/africa/undercover-police-arrested-over-beating-death-of-egyptian-man|title=Undercover Police Arrested Over Beating Death of Egyptian Man|author=Nadia abou el Magd|date=2 July 2010|accessdate=19 March 2011|work=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211164430/http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/africa/undercover-police-arrested-over-beating-death-of-egyptian-man|archivedate=11 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-June, the Facebook page had already 130,000 members that were active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/world/middleeast/06face.html|title=Movement Began With Outrage and a Facebook Page That Gave It an Outlet|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the photo and the heavy amount of international criticism that arose from the incident, the Egyptian government consented to a trial for the two detectives involved in his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We are all Khaled Said: Redefining political demonstration in Egypt|author=Noha El-Hennawy|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/61266 |newspaper=Almasry Alyoum|date=4 August 2010|accessdate=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, 2011, the administrator of the webpage, [[Wael Ghonim]] was arrested for 12 days. Egypt also blocked nearly all access to the internet throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Williams | first=Christopher | title=How Egypt shut down the internet | website=Telegraph.co.uk | date=2011-01-28 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/8288163/How-Egypt-shut-down-the-internet.html | ref=harv | access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghonim wanted to remain anonymous but could not avoid Egyptian security forces. It later became apparent that Wael recruited an Egyptian political activist named [[AbdelRahman Mansour|AbdulRahman Mansour]] to become his co-admin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/wael_ghonim_let_s_design_social_media_that_drives_real_change|title=Wael Ghonim TED Talk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both administrators received the credit for the creation of the site. Under the anonymous name "el shaheed" ("the martyr"), they were able to post and moderate the Arabic Facebook page. The involvement of Abdul Rahman Mansour in the creation of this page caused great controversy because he was a member of the January 25 coalition as well as the author of an article on the Muslim Brotherhood English website titled, "Mastermind Behind Egypt Uprising"&lt;ref name=WAAKS /&gt; This controversy revealed that Abdul Rahman Mansour previously had involvement with the Muslim brotherhood. In a 2011 interview, Ghonim blamed the regime for the people's anger, saying that blocking access to Facebook made them even angrier and led them to protests in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/wael-ghonim/|title=Internet activist Wael Ghonim, Part 1 {{!}} Interviews {{!}} Tavis Smiley {{!}} PBS|newspaper=Tavis Smiley {{!}} PBS|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/wael-ghonim-and-egypts-new-age-revolution/2/|title=Wael Ghonim and Egypt's New Age Revolution|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrator's role in running this page, according to Iskander, included a number of important functions, such as being: "the gatekeeper, flag bearer, spokesperson, democrat, motivator, mobilizer, and the source of general inspiration and appeal for the page. In addition to being the liaison between members, the admin is also the link and mediator between the members and the architecture of the page, which in this case is Facebook as an organization. His/her task is to keep everyone energized and inspiringly engaged."&lt;ref&gt;A. Iskander 2011 interview&lt;/ref&gt;{{Incomplete short citation|date=June 2016}}

The profile photograph promoting the page was a smiling photograph of Khaled Said which portrayed his middle class status and young innocence. The Facebook page existed in both Arabic and English, ensuring international exposure. Police forces were put under the spotlight because the webpage was advocating the fight against police brutality. By doing this, police forces became hesitant with their actions knowing that the Facebook page was being used to document their flaws and overuse of force.&lt;ref name="WAAKS"&gt;{{cite news|title='We Are All Khaled Said': The potentials and limitations of cyberactivism in triggering public mobilization and promoting political change |author=Sahar Khamis |author2=Katherine Vaughn |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/73986838/we-are-all-khaled-said-potentials-limitations-cyberactivism-triggering-public-mobilization-promoting-political-change |newspaper=Journal of Arab &amp; Muslim Media Research|date= July 2011|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 2010, [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], former head of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], led a rally in Alexandria against alleged abuses by the police and visited Saeed's family to offer condolences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/06/201062642955204618.html|title=ElBaradei leads anti-torture rally|publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]]|date=26 June 2010|accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadia Abou el Magd, [http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/africa/egypts-elbaradei-leads-thousands-in-protest-against-police?pageCount=0 "Egypt's ElBaradei leads thousands in protest against police"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307144000/http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/africa/egypts-elbaradei-leads-thousands-in-protest-against-police?pageCount=0 |date=7 March 2011 }}, ''The National'', 26 June 2010.

One of the earliest pre-revolution articles to link the death of Saeed to an imminent nationwide explosion came from Saeed's neighbor, Egyptian-Australian Amro Ali. In an opinion piece titled [http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=10663&amp;page=0 "Egypt's Collision Course with History"], Ali writes an intimate portrayal of Saeed and the Alexandria context, as well as the ramifications of his death for the regime. Ali states "Saeed's tragedy is Egypt's tragedy. A young man, neither a political activist nor religious radical, but an ordinary Egyptian whose accused actions could not in any way warrant his [[lynching]]. Saeed was someone's son, someone's brother, someone's friend, someone's neighbour, someone's customer, and if not for what had happened, someone's future. Saeed was, in the local vernacular, a son of Cleopatra [Saeed's suburb]. Yet the system that was supposed to protect him and give him his rights, took away those rights by taking away his life... It is one extra nail in the coffin of the ever-widening gulf between the ruler and ruled... What the Egyptian establishment maybe forgetting... is that pigeons come home to roost more than once."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ali|first=Amro|title=Egypt's Collision Course With History|url=http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=10663&amp;page=0|publisher=Online Opinion|date=29 July 2010|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali would later publish a personal and analytical account in Jadaliyya on the second anniversary of Saeed's death: [http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/5845/saeeds-of-revolution_de-mythologizing-khaled-saeed "Saeeds of Revolution: De-Mythologizing Khaled Saeed"]. As well as analysing what really happened to Saeed, Ali also examines the dynamics of how Saeed was rapidly mythologized and the ramifications it has produced in Egyptian society.

While the actual impact of Ghonim's site cannot be determined,&lt;ref name=NATO/&gt; it was Ghonim who first published a call to protest on 25 January, to the followers of his blog, and protesters carried banners and posters displaying the photograph of Saaed's corpse.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/egypt-face-launched-revolution/story?id=12841488&amp;page=1|last=Ross|first= Brian|author2=Matthew Cole|title=Egypt: The Face That Launched A Revolution|work=[[ABC News]]|year=2011|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been named one of the catalysts of the [[2011 Egyptian protests]], as an instance in which people formed a community around opposition to police brutality and, by extension, other government abuses.&lt;ref name="NYTFB"/&gt; On 11 February 2011, these protests resulted in the resignation of [[Hosni Mubarak]] after 30 years in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-11/mubarak-leaves-presidency-hands-power-to-egypt-s-military-suleiman-says.html|title=Mubarak Resigns as Egyptian President|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=11 February 2011|accessdate=11 February 2011|first1=Ahmed A|last1=Namatalla|first2=Mariam|last2=Fam|first3=Maram|last3=Mazen}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ABC News]] characterized Saaed in his morgue photo as "The Face That Launched a Revolution".&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; ''The Washington Post'' wrote that "Had it not been for a leaked morgue photo of his mangled corpse, tenacious relatives and the power of Facebook, the death of Khaled Said would have become a footnote in the annals of Egyptian police brutality. Instead, outrage over the beating death of the 28-year-old man in this coastal city last summer, and attempts by local authorities to cover it up, helped spark the mass protests demanding the ouster of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/08/AR2011020806360.html|title=Egyptian Man's Death Became Symbol of Callous State|first=Ernesto|last=Londono|date=9 February 2011|accessdate=19 March 2011|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and trial of the police officers==
The investigation into Saeed's death yielded 300 papers, analysis and testimony which informed the decision to charge both police officers, Mahmoud Salah Mahmoud and Awad Ismael Suleiman, in criminal court with use of violence and unjustified detention of the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/55686|title=exclusive: Khaled Saeed case investigation|publisher=Al Masry Al Youm|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were detained in July 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/53178|title=2 Alex policemen detained in Khaled Saeed case|publisher=Al Masry Al Youm|date=30 June 2010|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the trial began in July but was postponed and did not resume until February 2011 when it was postponed again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/302734 |title=Alexandria's Khaled Saeed police brutality trial postponed|publisher=Al Masry Al Youm|date=22 January 2011|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0630/Khaled-Said-verdict-and-Egyptian-justice-delayed-again|title=Khaled Said verdict – and Egyptian justice – delayed again|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|date=30 June 2011|accessdate=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 2011, Alexandria's criminal court adjourned the trial until 22 October 2011 as Judge Moussa al-Nahrawy decided to postpone the case to allow both the plaintiff's and the defendants' lawyers to review the report of a third forensic committee, whose formation the court had ordered in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/498838 |title=Al-Masry Al-Youm 24 September 2011: Khaled Saeed's trial adjourned to 22 October|publisher=Almasry Alyoum|date=24 September 2011|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/498898|title=Al-Masry Al-Youm 24 September 2011: Khaled Saeed murder trial adjourned for study of latest forensics report|publisher=Almasry Alyoum|date=24 September 2011|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 October 2011, both defendants were found guilty of manslaughter and were sentenced to seven years.&lt;ref name=bbc_convict&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/15467022|title=Egypt jails police over activist Khaled Said's death|work=BBC News|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/508951|title=Two policemen convicted in Khaled Saeed murder case|work=Almasry Alyoum|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human rights]] [[activist]]s, such as the [[Egyptian Organization for Human Rights]], objected to the short sentences. The two officers were convicted of using excessive force which killed Saeed but were not convicted of the more serious charge of "torture with the purpose of killing" which is a [[capital crime]]. Organizations such as the [[April 6 Youth Movement]] and the 25 Revolution Youth Union also criticized the verdict for its [[leniency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/509283|work=Almasry Alyoum|title=Rights group demands heavier sentence in Khaled Saeed case|date=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution and defence both appealed the sentence and a retrial was ordered. On 3 March 2014, Alexandria criminal court increased the punishment by three years sentencing the two police officers to ten years in prison.&lt;ref name=sentence/&gt;

On September 28, 2014, [[John Sheridan (New Jersey government official)|John Sheridan]], a former [[New Jersey Department of Transportation#NJDOT Commissioners|New Jersey Transportation Commissioner]] and health care executive, was found dead along with his wife Joyce in their [[Skillman, New Jersey|Skillman]] home. Firefighters found their bodies in the house's [[master bedroom]] after putting out a fire there. Both had suffered stab wounds which were found to have killed them; the case was initially believed by the [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset County]] prosecutor's office to have been a [[murder-suicide]].&lt;ref name="NYT mag article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sokolove|first=Michael|title=Who Killed the Sheridans?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/magazine/who-killed-the-sheridans.html?mcubz=3&amp;_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=February 7, 2016|accessdate=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months later, prosecutor Geoffrey Soriano made that conclusion official in a public report. However, even before its release, the Sheridans' sons, led by Mark, who at the time served as chief counsel to the state's [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], had challenged that. Based on a second [[autopsy]] done by [[Michael Baden]], who wrote his own report, they believed it was more likely that their parents had been killed by an intruder who [[arson|set the fire]] in an attempt to destroy evidence.

The Sheridan sons vowed to have the finding overturned, and exercised considerable political influence to do so. A 2016 [[open letter]] to newly appointed state [[medical examiner]] Andrew Falzon supporting a change in the finding was signed by 200 prominent state residents, including three former governors and two former state attorneys general. In 2017 Falzon officially changed the manner of John Sheridan's death from suicide to undetermined.&lt;ref name="Ledger undetermined cause story"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=S.P.|last2=Hutchinson|first2=Dave|title=State medical examiner reverses suicide ruling in John Sheridan case|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/01/state_medical_examiner_changes_death_ruling_for.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=January 13, 2017|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their efforts to change the verdict revealed a number of deficiencies in the state's medical examiner system generally and the investigation of the Sheridan's deaths specifically. Before Falzon's appointment, the position had been vacant for six years following the resignation of a predecessor who had resigned out of frustration with the system and himself replaced another predecessor who resigned for the same reason. The [[forensic pathology|pathologist]] who performed the autopsies on the Sheridans was not board certified, had resigned from a previous position due to a failure to inform police about a changed autopsy finding, and may have yielded to pressure from the prosecutor's office. One of the detectives who had initially been part of the investigation filed a [[whistleblower]] lawsuit, later dismissed, alleging he had been subject to retaliation after he had complained about how evidence related to the case was either mishandled or destroyed.

==Background==

John Sheridan, a senior partner in the [[Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown]] law firm of [[Riker, Danzig, Scherer, Hyland &amp; Perretti]], was a lifelong [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] whose career in [[Government of New Jersey|New Jersey state government]] during the 1970s had culminated in his service as [[New Jersey Department of Transportation#NJDOT Commissioners|Transportation Commissioner]] in the cabinet of [[List of governors of New Jersey|Governor]] [[Thomas Kean]] from 1982 to 1985. In that capacity he had overseen the transfer of [[commuter rail]] service in the state from federally-owned [[Conrail]] to the newly created [[New Jersey Transit Rail Operations]]. He later served on the transition teams for Republican governors [[Christine Whitman]] and [[Chris Christie]] following their elections.&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger funeral story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hochman|first=Larry|title=Christie speaking today at memorial for John Sheridan and wife, investigation continues|url=http://www.nj.com/somerset/index.ssf/2014/10/memorial_today_for_political_figure_john_sheridan_and_wife_joyce_questions_about_deaths_remain.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=October 7, 2014|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He and his wife Joyce had settled in [[Skillman, New Jersey|Skillman]], an affluent section of [[Montgomery Township, New Jersey|Montgomery Township]] in [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset County]], a short distance north of [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]. There they had raised four sons, twins Mark and Matt, and Dan and Jim. Mark himself followed in his father's footsteps, reaching the level of senior partner in the global [[Squire Patton Boggs]] law firm and serving as chief counsel to New Jersey's Republican Party.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

In 2005 he had left Riker Danzig to take over as chief executive officer of [[Cooper University Hospital]] in [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]]. Working together with the chairman of the hospital's board, [[George Norcross]], a prominent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] leader in [[South Jersey]], he oversaw an expansion of the hospital into what is today called Cooper Health System. The new facilities included a four-year medical college and cancer center.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

==Deaths==
Shortly before dawn on September 28, 2014, local firefighters responded to a report of flames at the Sheridans' house on Meadow Run Drive. Smoke was coming from one area of the second floor that turned out to be the [[master bedroom]]. After entering through the unlocked front door, the firefighters went upstairs and easily put out the fire, fueled by [[gasoline]] that had been poured on the floor as an [[accelerant]]. Also on the floor, they found the bodies of John and Joyce, lying face up. John was pronounced dead at the scene,&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt; as was Joyce after her body was taken to [[University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro]].&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger memorial service article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Arco|first=Matt|title=Christie, former N.J. governors, hundreds more, honor John and Joyce Sheridan at memorial service|url=http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/10/sheridan_memorial_in_trenton.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=October 7, 2014|accessdate=September 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The can from which the gas had been poured also was nearby, along with matches and knives. A heavy wooden [[armoire]] had fallen across John Sheridan's body, breaking several of his ribs; his wife had suffered first- and second-degree burns over many parts of her body. There were stab wounds on both bodies.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

Joyce Sheridan's body had 12 stab wounds, mostly on her head and hands. One that pierced her [[aorta]] was found to be the lethal wound; her death was thus called a [[homicide]]. John had only five such wounds, mostly on his neck and torso; soot was found in his lungs during the [[autopsy]], suggesting he had been alive when the fire started. The [[medical examiner]] deferred listing a cause of death "pending further investigation."&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

A week later, a [[memorial service]] was held for John and Joyce at Patriot's Theater at the [[Trenton War Memorial]]. The family was joined by hundreds of mourners, including Governor Christie and his predecessors Thomas Kean, Christie Whitman and Democrat [[Jim Florio]]. Many of the public officials present praised John Sheridan's career and accomplishments. "The city of Camden is a different place because of his vision," Norcross said.&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger memorial service article" /&gt; The actual [[funeral]] was private.&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger funeral story"/&gt;

==Investigation==

The investigators clashed with the Sheridan family from the morning the bodies were found. Responding firefighters notified Matt Sheridan, who lived at the house with his parents but was away from it on a fishing trip on [[Fishers Island, New York|Fishers Island]] off the coast of [[Connecticut]], from which he began making his own way home. He in turn called his twin brother Mark, a senior partner in the [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] office of the global law firm [[Squire Patton Boggs]]&lt;ref name="InsideNJ medical examiner article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shelly|first=Kevin|title=Sheridan deaths reveal troubled N.J. Medical Examiner's Office|url=http://www.nj.com/inside-jersey/index.ssf/2015/06/sheridan_deaths_reveal_troubled_nj_medical_examiners_office.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=June 10, 2015|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebrating his wedding anniversary with his wife at a hotel on New York's [[Upper East Side, Manhattan|Upper East Side]], who drove down to the house. When he arrived he found it surrounded with [[Barricade tape|crime scene tape]] and was not allowed in.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

After Matt Sheridan arrived, police found a small quantity of [[cocaine]] in his car. He was also in possession of a digital scale and plastic bags coated with white powder on the inside. They put him under arrest, but did not charge him at that time.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

On Mark's way there, he picked up his brother Tim and learned that [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset County]] prosecutor Geoffrey Soriano was on the scene. Since he did not know Soriano personally, he called [[Christopher Porrino|Chris Porrino]], chief counsel to Governor [[Chris Christie|Christie]] (and later the state's attorney general), who had appointed Soriano.{{efn|In New Jersey, unlike most other states, the chief lawyer responsible for prosecuting criminal offenses at the county level is appointed by the governor and confirmed by the [[New Jersey State Senate|State Senate]], to serve a five-year term, rather than being elected by the voters of the county.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;}} Mark knew Porrino from his own work as chief counsel to the state's [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Soriano called him as he arrived at the scene and told him that the fire appeared to be [[arson]] and that John and Joyce had been fatally stabbed.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

The Sheridans, all of whom made their way to the scene of the fire that morning, assumed that their parents had been killed by an intruder and that police would be searching for who might have done it. However, within a week, Soriano's office made statements reassuring the public that there was no danger of further attacks. "We are quite confident that there exists no threat to either the immediate neighborhood or to the local community," his spokesman said.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

At a meeting with Mark, Soriano explained how investigators had come to [[murder-suicide]] as the most likely explanation for the couple's deaths. John Sheridan's body, he told Mark, had [[hesitation wounds]], commonly found on people committing suicide by cutting themselves. Soriano told Mark that detectives would be looking through the couple's phones, emails and other records for evidence of extramarital affairs, financial problems or [[domestic violence]] that might explain a murder-suicide, and which he believed from his experience would turn up.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

All the Sheridan brothers found the theory highly doubtful. They knew their parents well and had seen no sign of any issues between them that might have led to such a violent end. They hired [[Michael Baden]], a well-known former [[forensic pathologist]] who had been the chief [[medical examiner]] for New York City and had hosted [[HBO]]'s ''[[Autopsy (TV series)|Autopsy]]'', to assist and consult with deputy state medical examiner Eddy Lilavois.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

Baden and Lilavois agreed that the stab wounds to both bodies had been caused by the same knife. They could not determine whether that knife was one of the two recovered at the scene, both kitchen knives. One, in fact, was designed for slicing bread and therefore had a [[serrated blade]] with a rounded tip, features that would not have made it the best choice for stabbing someone. It was likelier that it had been a third knife which had perhaps not yet been found.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

In addition to going through the Sheridans' records, detectives interviewed 180 friends, family and coworkers. Those efforts turned up nothing suggesting any major issues with either of them that could have prompted the crime. The only sign that either of them might have had some reason to be unhappy was from John's job. According to Cooper's chief counsel, Gary Lesneski, John was worried about the effect an upcoming state report on high fatality rates at the hospital's cardiac unit, a report they expected to be very negative, might have on the hospital. But Lesneski said he had left it as a work issue for the weekend, and one of his last emails, a lengthy response to a question from Norcross written the evening before the fire, was well-composed and lengthy, typical of Sheridan and showing no sign its author was emotionally distressed.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

The [[toxicology]] report on John and Joyce yielded no new information. John's blood had the signs of the heart medication he took, and Joyce had a high level of prescription painkillers. This was due to the continuing consequences of a fall she incurred in her last year of work as a schoolteacher, around 1999, that had injured her back and required multiple surgeries and [[orthopedic]] treatments. "Mom was on enough meds to kill a small farm animal," Mark Sheridan later told ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

[[DNA]] from the blood on the knives was tested, but did not reveal anything conclusive. The amount collected was insufficient to test for anything more than the racial characteristics and gender of the source. The blood on them had come from a white male.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

During the investigation, the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' filed a lawsuit seeking disclosure of the case reports and other records related to it. The court sided with the state and kept them sealed.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

===Family questions===

Around the time of Mark Sheridan's meeting with Soriano, he and his brothers were allowed to re-enter the house as the investigation of the scene had concluded. In the [[master bedroom]], where the fire had been, they found a melted lump of metal next to where their father's body had been found. What it had been was not certain, but the brothers believed it might have been the third knife, although it could have been a knob from the [[armoire]] as well.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

If it was, it was not part of the set of knives in the kitchen from which the other two had come. Their blades were made from [[alloy]]s that required high temperatures to melt, temperatures that would only be achieved in a [[structure fire]] if it burned the whole house, or at least the whole room. That had not been the case with the Sheridan house, where the fire only damaged part of the room. John Sheridan's undershirt, which he was wearing when he died, was only charred, not burned. Mark Sheridan sent Soriano a lengthy email expressing his frustration with this and other apparent failures of the investigation.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

The melted metal object was not the only item of evidence that the Sheridans believed investigators had overlooked. A month after the fire, an [[insurance adjuster]] inspecting the house found a [[Fire iron|fireplace poker]] in the adjoining bedroom, odd since the house has no upstairs fireplace. The brothers theorized that that could have been the cause of John Sheridan's broken ribs instead of the falling armoire.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

==Report==

In late March, Soriano released his office's report on the death of John Sheridan. It found no evidence of an intruder, and concluded that he and Joyce were the only ones in the house. Instead of being undetermined, his death was now considered a suicide.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

Soriano said detectives had conducted 180 interviews and looked through all the couple's records. It quoted some unnamed witnesses describing John as "'disproportionately concerned,' 'genuinely worried' and 'overly worried' " about the upcoming state report on the cardiac unit's problems.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt; Reportedly he was planning a meeting with some coworkers at the hospital the day he died.&lt;ref name="Courier–Post report article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walsh|first=Jim|title=Report: John Sheridan 'very upset' before deaths|url=http://www.courierpostonline.com/story/news/crime/2015/03/27/report-sheridan-deaths-murder-suicide/70547358/|newspaper=[[Courier-Post]]|date=March 27, 2015|accessdate=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbery was ruled out as a motive since nearly a thousand dollars in cash remained on a nightstand; jewelry and prescription drugs that might have been of interest to a thief had also not been taken. The house had not been forcibly entered, nor had neighbors reported any prowlers in the area before or immediately after the fire. DNA from the blood on the knife, Soriano wrote, was consistent with John Sheridan.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

Based on the lack of evidence for other theories, and the five hesitation wounds, Soriano concluded that the deaths had, as investigators originally believed, been a [[murder-suicide]]. His report did not speculate on how the Sheridans came to end their lives that way, whether it had been planned (as the presence of the gas can, brought up from the basement to start the fire, and the kitchen knives suggested might have been the case) or the result of a sudden impulso or fight between the couple, or what the motive might have been. A single wound to the [[jugular vein]], in conjunction with [[smoke inhalation]] from the fire, was given as the cause of death.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

In the one interview he has given about the report, Soriano dismissed the melted piece of metal the brothers found. "I don't know what it is. It could have been anything" he told ''[[Star-Ledger]]'' columnist Tom Moran. "What we tried to do was gather all the relevant evidence", he said when asked about the report's failure to convincingly identify a motive. "I don't know what else was going on in his life."&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

===Criticism===

Mark Sheridan had been in regular contact with Soriano and was able to review the report in its final drafts before it was made public. He strongly disagreed with its conclusions, and expressed that opinion in news coverage. ""To be clear, we do not have answers to what happened to our parents," he said in a statement on behalf of himself and his brothers. "Based on the evidence, neither do the investigators."&lt;ref name="Courier–Post report article" /&gt;

"I've said to the prosecutor, 'It's bad enough you’re calling my father a murderer, but you're also calling him a moron, as though he weren't smart enough to work this out.' " If his father genuinely wanted to kill himself and his wife, Mark said later, he would have planned it in such a way as to leave no doubt. Other members of the family agreed. "The prosecutor's conclusion destroyed their legacy and the good that John and Joyce had done in their lives", said John's brother [[Peter G. Sheridan|Peter]], a federal judge.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

In addition to the uncertainties created by the metal object and the poker found later, the brothers believe it was impossible for the crime to have been committed as the prosecutor imagined it had. They had, in private conversations, considered the possibility that their mother, known to be more prone to angry outbursts than her husband, might have initiated something which escalated into what the firefighters found. But, they realized, the {{convert|5|ft|2|in|cm|adj=on}} Joyce would have had to raise her hands above her shoulders to inflict her husband's fatal wound, and with her chronic upper-back pain from her injury it would have been unlikely that she could have, or that if she had she would not have been able to strike with sufficient force.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

Baden, in an affidavit filed with the brothers' later court action, went further in his criticisms of the prosecutor's conclusions. John had not shown any signs of [[suicidal ideations]] or depression before his death, he noted. None of the knives present could have caused any of his thin and deep wounds, not even the purported hesitation wounds, he claimed (nor did he believe the melted metal had been a knife). The angle of John's neck wound, downward and slightly forward, was also consistent with being attacked. And if John had stabbed Joyce, some of her blood should have been on him, but none was.&lt;ref name="Philadelphia Inquirer article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Boyer|first=Barbara|title=Expert says intruder likely killed the Sheridans|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/new_jersey/20160619_Expert_says_intruder_likely_killed_the_Sheridans.html|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=June 19, 2016|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Baden did not feel the evidence necessarily pointed to an intruder, he did say some evidence supported that conclusion. [[Bloodstain pattern analysis|Blood spatter]] on the walls was consistent with an attack, and contrary to Soriano's assertion that the stabbing had been confined to the Sheridans' bedroom, there was blood  on the wall near the top of the stair. The injuries to John's upper body, including the broken ribs, could just as easily have resulted from being struck repeatedly with the poker as from the armoire falling on him. He also had had a chipped front tooth not noted in the initial autopsy report, but without the bruises on the face that would be expected if the armoire had caused it.

Baden also had his colleague [[Henry Lee (forensic scientist)|Henry Lee]] review the results from the DNA on the knives. While Soriano had said was consistent with John Sheridan, the lab report had only said that due to the minimal amount available it could only be determined with certainty to have come from a white male. Lee told Baden that they had a genetic pattern that did not match any male member of the Sheridan family.&lt;ref name="Philadelphia Inquirer article" /&gt;

Baden believed it was more likely that both Sheridans were victims of a homicide, perhaps by someone who intended to kill them both or a burglar caught unawares. "If it's murder-suicide, it's a very unusual murder-suicide", he told the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' in 2016. However, he said the evidence was not strong enough to call the case a homicide, instead advocating for it to be changed to "undetermined".&lt;ref name="Philadelphia Inquirer article" /&gt;

Dennis Cogan, a former Philadelphia prosecutor turned defense attorney who reviewed Baden's affidavit for the ''Inquirer'', agreed. "The missing knife is so overwhelming that there's a third person who did this," he said. He believed that Soriano and his investigators had attempted to make whatever facts they found fit their original theory rather than following them where they led.&lt;ref name="Philadelphia Inquirer article" /&gt;

As a result of his discontent with Soriano's conclusions, Mark Sheridan decided to step down as the chief counsel for the New Jersey Republican Party so he could concentrate on reversing them&lt;ref name="InsideNJ medical examiner article" /&gt; (although he continued to represent the party and Governor Christie's office in some matters related to the [[Fort Lee lane closure scandal|George Washington Bridge scandal]]&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;). He vowed to use the influence he had to block Soriano's reappointment to the prosecutor's office in the coming fall. The family offered $250,000 for any information leading to the identity or arrest of whoever had killed John and Joyce.&lt;ref name="InsideNJ medical examiner article" /&gt;

====Problems with state medical examiner system====

Mark also connected his parents' case to the general problems of New Jersey's medical examiner system. "[It's] a disaster, an embarrassment. MEs should not be under the attorney general or law enforcement. They should not be agents of the state", he told ''[[The Star-Ledger]]''. Some of the state's former chief medical examiners agreed with him.&lt;ref name="InsideNJ medical examiner article" /&gt;

At the time of John and Joyce's deaths, the position of chief medical examiner, in fact, had been vacant for six years (without someone even being designated acting chief). Victor Weedn, the previous chief, had resigned in 2009, telling Governor [[Jon Corzine]] that he found the experience "disappointing" and lacking the statutorily required oversight from the Attorney General and the state's Division of Criminal Justice. He noted that all but the first two chief medical examiners appointed since the position had been created late in the 20th century had similarly resigned in frustration. A new chief medical examiner, Andrew Falzon, was appointed by Governor Christie in June 2015.&lt;ref name="InsideNJ medical examiner article" /&gt;

Problems with the system were worse at lower levels in ways that may have directly affected the Sheridan case. The Northern Regional Medical Examiner's office, under whose auspices Lilavois worked, had failed to achieve reaccreditation by the National Association of Medical Examiners in 2012. Among the failings noted, one of the most serious was that the toxicology lab, which served the entire state, had let its accreditation by the [[College of American Pathologists]] lapse in 2009, and was not then listed as certified to conduct testing by the American Board of Forensic Toxicology.&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger ME docs article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shelly|first=Kevin|title=Documents show N.J. regional medical examiner's office failed accreditation review in 10 areas|url=http://www.nj.com/inside-jersey/index.ssf/2015/06/documents_show_nj_regional_medical_examiners_office_failed_accreditation_review_in_10_areas.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=June 18, 2015|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lilavois himself was not board certified in [[forensic pathology]], although he had been performing autopsies since 1997. He had come to work for New Jersey after resigning from the [[Office of Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York|New York City medical examiner's office]] following an incident where he had revised a finding of death in the case of a [[Queens, New York|Queens]] three-year-old from homicide by blunt force to natural death by [[brain aneurysm]]. However, despite making the change three weeks after the original autopsy following a review with a colleague, he did not notify either the police or the child's family for almost a year; both learned of the change only when the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' obtained a copy of the amended death certificate as part of its reporting on the case. In the interim police had continued to investigate the case as a homicide, and the boy's parents had gotten divorced, with the father viewed by everyone as having killed his son.&lt;ref name="InsideNJ medical examiner article" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Lauer case article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoffman|first=John|title=Falsely Accused in Death Of Son, Man Fights Back|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/04/nyregion/falsely-accused-in-death-of-son-man-fights-back.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 5, 1997|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the vacant state medical examiner position, no one supervised Lilavois' autopsy of John Sheridan. Mark believes that that might be the reason the pathologist's report misstates his father's height, weight and age.&lt;ref name="InsideNJ medical examiner article" /&gt; In later comments on the case, Weedn says it would not have mattered even if there had been a chief medical examiner, since the state medical examiner has no statutory or regulatory oversight authority over county or regional medical examiners, who are appointed by county governments. "The state medical examiner is merely a figurehead", said Faruk Presswala, Weedn's predecessor, who also resigned over that.&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger ME toothless story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zaremba|first=Justin|title=Will new state medical examiner have a toothless job?|url=http://www.nj.com/somerset/index.ssf/2015/06/new_state_medical_examiner_would_walk_into_a_tooth.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=June 9, 2015|accessdate=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheridan also faulted Lilavois's lack of independence from the prosecutor's office. He noted in a letter to [[John Jay Hoffman]], then the state's Acting Attorney General, that Lilavois had met with Soriano three times before the prosecutor issues his final report, and did not issue his pathological finding until just before the report was published. According to Sheridan the county prosecutor held those meetings to convince Lilavois to rule the case a murder-suicide.&lt;ref name="InsideNJ medical examiner article" /&gt;

Weedn says New Jersey's medical examiners need to be under the jurisdiction of an independent office not under law enforcement jurisdiction. "People get rewarded for convictions, they get raises and promotions. There is an essential bias" argues Lawrence Kobilinsky, chair of the science department at [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] and chair of the Northeastern Association of Forensic Scientists. While law enforcement and medical examiners do need to be able to communicate and coordinate their efforts, the latter should be under the jurisdiction of a state's health department to remain independent. "It is essential that these organizations remain independent of each other", Kobilinsky told the ''Star-Ledger''.&lt;ref name="InsideNJ medical examiner article" /&gt;

====Response====

There was some backlash from the Sheridans' criticism. Following Mark's comments in news stories criticizing both Soriano and his report, [[Raymond Bateman]], a former [[New Jersey State Senate|State Senate]] president and the Republican Party's [[New Jersey gubernatorial election, 1977|1977 gubernatorial candidate]], wrote an op-ed piece in the ''[[Home News Tribune]]'', [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]]'s daily newspaper, defending Soriano. Bateman's son [[Christopher Bateman|Christopher]], who had followed his father into the State Senate, had sponsored Soriano's nomination.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

Bateman took it as an established fact that John Sheridan, whom he knew from his own days in the State Senate, was mentally ill in some way when he died. He compared him to Andreas Lubitz, the pilot who shortly before the report's release had deliberately crashed [[Germanwings Flight 9525|a Germanwings flight]] into the side of a French mountain, killing 149 passengers and crew in addition to himself, and was later found to have been suffering from depression severe enough that he feared losing his commercial pilot's license. "As I write with tears about my friend, John," Bateman wrote, "I recognize that mental depression must just completely overwhelm a person's normal judgment."&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

Although he had agreed with Sheridan about the failings of the state medical examiner system, Weedn defended Lilavois' conclusion. Based on reviewing the autopsy reports, he found the couple's injuries "more consistent as a generality with a murder-suicide", although he qualified that by saying he had not seen the photos. Weedn said it was unlikely that a burglar or intruder would have confronted the Sheridans in their bedroom; such struggles usually occur on the ground floor of a house closer to any entrance that might have been used. He agreed that the possibility of homicide could not be ruled out, particularly if the blade used could not be found.&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger Weedn defense story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Zaremba|first=Justin|title=Ex-N.J. medical examiner: Sheridan deaths look like murder-suicide|url=http://www.nj.com/somerset/index.ssf/2015/06/ex-nj_medical_examiners_sheridan_case.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=September 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court challenge and whistleblower lawsuit==

In December 2014 Mark and his brothers had sent Baden's affidavit to [[New Jersey Attorney General|the state's]] and chief medical examiner, asking that their father's cause of death be recorded as undetermined. They received no reply, and over the next few months let the state know that if John Sheridan was officially ruled to have taken his own life, they would file a lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Philadelphia Inquirer article" /&gt; After Soriano's report was released, they did.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;
 
The state's initial response was to move that the suit be dismissed for lack of [[Standing (law)|standing]]. "No legal basis exists to compel a medical examiner to change his opinion about manner of death", the Attorney General's office wrote in its response. A three-judge panel ruled that the case should be filed against the medical examiner's office.&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt;

While that suit was pending, two other developments occurred in early 2016 that supported the Sheridans' cause. In February a group of 200 prominent state residents, including three former governors, two former attorneys general, a former justice of the [[New Jersey Supreme Court|state Supreme Court]] and many lawyers, signed an [[open letter]] asking the medical examiner to change the finding.&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger residents' letter story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hutchinson|first=Dave|title=Sheridan deaths deserve new probe, 3 N.J. ex-governors say|url=http://www.nj.com/somerset/index.ssf/2016/02/report_3_ex-governors_sign_letter_requesting_reope.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=February 8, 2016|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three months later, a Somerset County detective filed a [[whistleblower]] lawsuit claiming that "It was common knowledge among detectives assigned to the Forensic Unit that the Sheridan evidence was improperly collected, improperly preserved and subsequently destroyed" and that he had been retaliated against for complaining about this.&lt;ref name="NJ 101.5 lawsuit story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bichao|first=Sergio|title=Detective in Cooper Hospital CEO slaying case: Investigator threw evidence in garbage|url=http://nj1015.com/investigators-in-slaying-of-nj-hosp-exec-and-wife-destroyed-evidence-detective-says/|newspaper=[[WKXW-FM]]|date=May 4, 2016|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, Detective Jeffrey Scozzafava's suit alleged that:
* The officers running the prosecutor's Forensics Unit had little or no experience in that area of police work;
* Large pieces of charred bedding from the Sheridans' bedroom were left lying on the floor of the truck that had brought them to the lab for months, then stored in an open bag in the fingerprint lab;
* Blood collection swabs were not packaged properly after being taken;
* Evidence envelopes were not properly taped shut, and ...
* A supervisor told the prosecutors that the officers had search for fingerprints using a non-existent "flashlight technique", which Scozzafava characterized as an excuse for not having done it at all.
When he pointed these failures out, the detective said, he was reassigned to a unit dealing with fugitives, a less prestigious position. He later claimed to have seen the Forensics Unit's supervisor throwing the improperly collected and stored evidence in the garbage during 2015.&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger detective lawsuit story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hutchinson|first=Dave|title=Detective's lawsuit claims investigators destroyed Sheridan evidence|url=http://www.nj.com/somerset/index.ssf/2016/05/detective_says_investigation_into_death_of_sherida.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=May 5, 2016|accessdate=September 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, the Sheridans prevailed. State medical examiner Andrew Falzon, after reviewing the evidence, changed the manner of John Sheridan's death from suicide to undetermined. While Falzon still said he believed the wounds were self-inflicted, "no weapon was recovered from the scene that could be conclusively associated with the wounds sustained by Mr. Sheridan." The damage to the scene caused by the fire further compounded the difficulty of reconstructing events that night. Mark Sheridan said that while the family felt vindicated by the change, "we have a long way yet to go".&lt;ref name="Ledger undetermined cause story" /&gt; They called for the case to be reopened and reinvestigated.&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger reinvestigation call story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hutchinson|first=Dave|title=Sheridan sons want new investigation of parents' deaths|url=http://www.nj.com/somerset/index.ssf/2017/01/sheridans_to_ask_prosecutors_office_to_reopen_inve.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=January 14, 2017|accessdate=September 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Soczzafava's suit was dismissed after [[oral argument]]. The county had argued that his claim was really motivated by "being assigned a Chevrolet rather than a Dodge" and that since he still worked full-time in the prosecutor's office he had not been harmed. Scozzafava's lawyer said his client planned to appeal.&lt;ref name="Inquirer Scozzafava suit dismissal"&gt;{{cite news|last=Boyer|first=Barbara|title=Whistle-blower lawsuit in Sheridan death investigation is dismissed by Somerset County judge|url=http://www.nj.com/somerset/index.ssf/2017/01/whistle-blower_lawsuit_in_sheridan_investigation_c.html|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=January 12, 2017|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other subsequent events==

While the brothers' suit was pending, in February 2016, Christie, himself a former federal prosecutor, decided not to reappoint Soriano to a second term,&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger Soriano firing story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hutchinson|first=Dave|title=Sheridan case criticism leads to ouster of Somerset prosecutor|url=http://www.nj.com/somerset/index.ssf/2016/02/new_somerset_county_prosecutor_named_as_sheridan_c.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=February 19, 2016|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying later he had "lost confidence" in him.&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger detective lawsuit story" /&gt; News stories about the move cited not only the Sheridan case, but other recent cases in which Soriano's office had come in for criticism. He was replaced by Michael Robertson, also a former federal prosecutor,&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger Soriano firing story" /&gt; who had served under Christie when the governor was [[United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger Bateman retribution story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hutchinson|first=Dave|title=Retribution over gun veto override led to prosecutor's ouster, senator says|url=http://www.nj.com/somerset/index.ssf/2016/03/sorianos_replacement_to_be_sworn_in_monday_afterno.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=March 7, 2016|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It's long overdue that someone took charge of that office," Mark Sheridan said, upon being informed by a reporter. "I think there has been a long history of failures [there]." However, state senator [[Christopher Bateman]], who had recommended Soriano to Christie at the beginning of the governor's terms, was disappointed. Although the governor had denied to him the Sheridan case had anything to do with his decision to replace Soriano, " the timing is just too coincidental", coming so soon after the open letter. "He did the best he could with the Sheridan investigation. If it came down to that, it's wrong."&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger Soriano firing story" /&gt;{{efn|Later, Bateman also speculated that Christie was angry at him for joining the Senate's Democratic majority in voting to override the governor's [[veto]] of a bill that would grant police a say in whether mentally ill individuals can receive firearms permits, a process that had previously been purely judicial. It was the first time the legislature had overridden a veto of Christie's in six years as governor. Christie denied that either that or the Sheridan case played any role in his decision not to renew Soriano's appointment.&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger Bateman retribution story" /&gt;}} By that fall, Soriano had been hired as one of the state's assistant attorneys general.&lt;ref name="AG press release"&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Attorney General Issues Directive to Guide Prosecutors and Police in Implementing Historic Bail Reform That Will Keep Dangerous Criminals in Jail and Eliminate Unfair Monetary-Based Bail System|url=http://www.nj.gov/oag/newsreleases16/pr20161013b.html|location=[[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton, NJ]]|agency=[[New Jersey Attorney General]]|date=October 13, 2016|access-date=September 28, 2017|quote=Attorney General Porrino thanked Assistant Attorney General Ron Susswein and Assistant Attorney General Geoffrey Soriano for drafting the directive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months later, Matt Sheridan was [[indictment|indicted]] by a [[Middlesex County, New Jersey|Middlesex County]] [[grand jury]] on the cocaine possession charge that had led to his arrest on the morning of his parents' deaths a year and a half earlier.&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger Matt Sheridan indictment story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hutchinson|first=Dave|title=Sheridan's cocaine indictment punishment for probing parents' deaths, brother says|url=http://www.nj.com/somerset/index.ssf/2016/04/sheridans_say_somerset_promised_not_to_prosecute_m.html|newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=April 6, 2016|accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having expressed discontent with his twin brother for this having happened,&lt;ref name="NYT mag article" /&gt; Mark accused the prosecutor's office of having sought the charge only as retaliation for the family's efforts to change John's death certificate. He claimed that this violated a promise that had been made by Soriano shortly after the deaths. Due to the conflicts between the family and the prosecutor's office, the case was handled by the Middlesex County prosecutor's office, although any trial would take place in Somerset County.&lt;ref name="Star-Ledger Matt Sheridan indictment story" /&gt;

The adjective "dysgenic" is the antonym of "[[eugenic]]". It was first used {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1915 by [[David Starr Jordan]], describing the supposed dysgenic effects of [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan believed that healthy men were as likely to die in [[modern warfare]] as anyone else and that war killed only the physically healthy men of the populace whilst preserving the disabled at home.&lt;ref name="Jordan"&gt;{{cite book| last = Jordan| first = David Starr| title = War and the Breed: The Relation of War to the Downfall of Nations| publisher = University Press of the Pacific| year= 2003|edition=Reprint| isbn = 1-4102-0900-8|location = Honolulu, Hawaii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dysgenic [[mutation]]s have been studied in animals such as the mouse&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tanabe T, Beam KG, Powell JA, Numa S |title=Restoration of excitation-contraction coupling and slow calcium current in dysgenic muscle by dihydropyridine receptor complementary DNA |journal=Nature |volume=336 |issue=6195 |pages=134–9 |date=November 1988 |pmid=2903448 |doi=10.1038/336134a0 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v336/n6195/abs/336134a0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kidwell MG |title=Evolution of hybrid dysgenesis determinants in Drosophila melanogaster |journal=Proc.

In the context of [[human genetics]], a dysgenic effect is the projected or observed tendency of
a reduction in [[Mutation–selection balance|selection pressures]] and decreased [[infant mortality]] since the [[Industrial Revolution]] resulting in the increased propagation of deleterious traits and [[genetic disorder]]s. [[Richard Lynn]] in his ''[[Dysgenics: Genetic Deterioration in Modern Populations]]'' (1996) identified three main concerns: deterioration in [[health]], in [[Heritability of IQ|intelligence]], and in [[conscientiousness]].

== Genetic disorders ==
Rui Nunes wrote that dysgenics is the selection of genetic traits that are "commonly accepted as a disabling condition," and like eugenics, dysgenics can be positively selected or negatively selected.&lt;ref name="nunes"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nunes |first=Rui |last2= |first2= |date=March 2006 |title=Deafness, genetics and dysgenics |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11019-005-2852-9 |journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=25–31 |doi=10.1007/s11019-005-2852-9  |access-date=October 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nunes defined positive dysgenics as a selection that increases the number of individuals with dysgenic traits, while negative dysgenics is the discarding of genetics that cause disability.&lt;ref name="nunes"/&gt;

Improved medical and social care may possibly lead to increased incidence of [[genetic disorder]]s. Practices such as [[genetic counselling]] and [[prenatal screening]] may counteract this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Fertility and intelligence ==
Lynn argued that [[natural selection]] in pre-industrial societies favored traits such as intelligence and character but no longer does so in modern societies.&lt;ref name="lynn"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lynn | first1 = R. | doi = 10.1017/S0021932000023014 | title = Dysgenic fertility for criminal behaviour | journal = Journal of Biosocial Science | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially this may be limited to wealthy couples, who may possibly travel abroad for the procedure if prohibited in their own country and then gradually spread to increasingly larger groups. Alternatively, authoritarian states may decide to impose measures such as a licensing requirement for having a child, which would only be given to persons of a certain minimum intelligence{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}. The Chinese [[one-child policy]] was an example of how fertility can be regulated by authoritarian means.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.intell.2007.03.004| title = The decline of the world's IQ| year = 2008| last1 = Lynn | first1 = R.| last2 = Harvey | first2 = J.| journal = Intelligence| volume = 36| issue = 2| pages = 112–120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]] claims the one-child policy was implemented to reduce [[Demographics of China|China's population explosion]], and "to reduce dysgenic fertility among rural peasants."&lt;ref&gt;Edge, Chinese Eugenics, http://edge.org/response-detail/23838/&lt;/ref&gt; While the one-child policy made exceptions for rural families so that those families could have 2 children, this only applied "if their first-born is a girl."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Tsintolas |first1 = Alexa |title = Exceptions - China's One-Child Policy | access-date = 14 June 2018 |url = http://alexatsintolas.weebly.com/exceptions.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction ==
[[Cyril M. Kornbluth]]'s 1951 short story "[[The Marching Morons]]" is an example of dysgenic fiction, describing a man who accidentally ends up in the distant future and discovers that dysgenics has resulted in mass stupidity. [[Mike Judge]]'s 2006 film ''[[Idiocracy]]'' has the same premise, with the main character the subject of a military [[hibernation]] experiment that goes awry, taking him 500 years into the future. While in the Kornbluth short story, civilization is kept afloat by a small group of dedicated geniuses, [[voluntary childlessness]] wipes out the bloodlines of above-average intelligence and leaves only [[automation|automated systems]] to fill that role in ''Idiocracy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/09/business/09online.html |title=Shying away from Degeneracy|work=The New York Times|author=Mitchell, Dan|date=2006-09-09|accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Edinburgh BioQuarter''' is a [[bioscience]] community based near the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]] and the [[Queen's Medical Research Centre]] in [[Edinburgh]], close to the [[Roslin Institute for Animal Biology]]. It is Scotland's key initiative in the development of its [[life sciences]] industry, which employs more than 30,000 people in 600 companies.&lt;ref name=Entente-Health&gt;{{cite web|title=Edinburgh BioQuarter, the University of Edinburgh|url=http://entente-health.eu/Networking_Area/Organisations/TTO/Edinburgh-BioQuarter-The-University-Of-Edinburgh.kl#.VatRnfmqpBc|publisher=Entente-Health|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2007, [[Scottish Enterprise]] completed a series of land deals which cleared a 55-acre site for development adjacent to the existing Royal Infimary of Edinburgh and the creation of the BioQuarter was announced. In early 2010, Dr [[Mike Capaldi (doctor)|Mike Capaldi]] joined BioQuarter as Commercialisation Director and the development of an executive team and business creation programme were launched.

The key partners in the Edinburgh BioQuarter initiative are [[Scottish Enterprise]]/[[Scottish Development International]], the [[University of Edinburgh]] and [[NHS Lothian]].

From 2011, it will be joined at this location by the [[Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine]], giving the BioQuarter one of the highest concentrations of research classed officially by the government as "internationally leading" (four-star, according to the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise).

==Facilities and Companies==
[[File:Centre for Regenerative Medicine.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's impression of the Centre for Regenerative Medicine]]
Edinburgh BioQuarter currently co-locates a 1000+-bed [[teaching hospital]], the [[Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh]], with the Queen’s Medical Research Institute (ranked #1 in the UK for [[Clinical research|clinical medical research]], according to the 2008 research assessment exercise) and the [[Clinical Research Imaging Centre]], or CRIC, opened by [[Prince Phillip|HM the Duke of Edinburgh]] in late 2010.&lt;ref name=UKSPA&gt;{{cite web|title=Edinburgh BioQuarter|url=http://www.ukspa.org.uk/members/ebq|publisher=UKSPA|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the last three years, Edinburgh has attracted 53% of all [[Wellcome Trust]] grants in Scotland and 62% of [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) funding in Scotland, making it a major centre of research income.

In November 2011, a new [[bioincubator]] building will come on stream offering {{convert|80000|sqft|m2}} of office and laboratory space, as well as the new Scottish Centre for Regenerative Medicine (SCRM), headed by Professor Sir [[Ian Wilmut]], creator of "[[Dolly the Sheep]]." This new centre will apply Scotland’s world-leading [[stem cell research]] to new therapies for conditions such as [[Parkinson's disease]],{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} [[multiple sclerosis]] and other conditions.

In September &lt;ref name=Scotsman&gt;{{cite web|title=Edinburgh BioQuarter gains three new tenants|url=http://www.scotsman.com/business/management/edinburgh-bioquarter-gains-three-new-tenants-1-2776226|publisher=Scotsman|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2010, author [[JK Rowling]] endowed research at the BioQuarter with a £10 million gift to create the [[Anne Rowling Centre for Multiple Sclerosis]].

By 2016, the new [[Royal Hospital for Children and Young People]]&lt;ref name="Scottish Entreprise"&gt;{{cite web|title=Opportunities at Edinburgh BioQuarter|url=http://www.scottish-enterprise.com/services/develop-new-products-and-services/bioquarter-commercialisation/overview|publisher=Scottish Entreprise|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; will be located at the BioQuarter, together with the [[Scottish Mind and Body Institute]], a cross-disciplinary centre aimed at finding cures or therapies for [[Neurology|neurological conditions]].

==Companies based at Edinburgh BioQuarter==

Part of BioQuarter’s purpose is to create new companies based on [[medical research]] being undertaken in the [[National Health Service|NHS]] and at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. For this purpose it has created an innovation competition, offering prizes worth £45,000 to researchers in all disciplines at the University of Edinburgh and [[NHS Lothian]]. The first round of these prizes will be awarded in March 2011.

Companies currently located at or associated with the BioQuarter community include:&lt;ref name=UKSPA /&gt;

*[[Fios Genomics]] – genomic and bioinformatics data analysis services for [[drug discovery]] &amp; development
*[[Immunosolv]] – technologies and products for the removal of dead cells
*[[TPP Global Development]] - a drug development company with offices in London and Edinburgh
*[[I2Eye Ltd]] – [[visual field impairment]] testing for small children and [[special needs]] groups
*[[NeuroORG]] – [[management consultancy]] that shapes organisational behaviour on the basis of [[neurological science]]

Further companies are expected to join the BioQuarter community over the next twelve months as the process of company formation gathers pace. In addition, licensing deals and other partnerships with major international pharmaceutical companies and equipment manufacturers will add to the number of organisations housed at the BioQuarter.

[[File:Ferdinand of Majorca tournois.jpg|thumb|A ''[[denier tournois|denarius]]'' minted by Ferdinand during his brief rule in Achaea]]
'''Ferdinand of Majorca''' ({{lang-ca|Ferran de Mallorca}}; 1278, [[Perpignan]]&amp;nbsp;– 5 July 1316, [[Glarentza]]) was an ''[[infante]]'' of the [[Kingdom of Majorca]] as the third son of King [[James II of Majorca|James II]]. He was Viscount of [[Aumelas]] and Lord of [[Frontignan]] from 1311 and claimed the title of [[Prince of Achaea]] from 1315.

He was sent by [[Frederick III of Sicily]] to take command of the [[Catalan Company]] in Frederick's name, but was rebuffed by [[Bernat de Rocafort]], one of their leaders. On his return with the chronicler [[Ramon Muntaner|Ramón Muntaner]], he was captured by the [[Venice|Venetians]] at [[Lordship of Negroponte|Negroponte]]. He had been released by 1310, when he distinguished himself at the siege of [[Almería]] by killing the son of the King of [[Guadix]].

In 1313, he returned to [[Sicily]] to take part in the war then in hand with the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevins]] and was created Lord of [[Catania]]. [[Margaret of Villehardouin]] was then in Sicily, seeking to advance her claim to the [[Principality of Achaea]]. She gave her daughter [[Isabella of Sabran]] to Ferdinand in marriage and resigned [[Barony of Akova|Akova]] and her claim on Achaea to the couple, who were married in [[Messina]]. Margaret died in March 1315 in captivity in [[Chlemoutsi]], and her daughter on 7 May 1315 in Catania, shortly after bearing a son, [[James III of Majorca]].

Shortly after her death, Ferdinand set out with a small company for the Morea to uphold the claim now held by his son. He seized Clarenza in June 1315 and briefly took control of the Morea. In the autumn of 1315 he took a second wife, Isabella of Ibelin, daughter of the Seneschal of [[Cyprus]]. However, his rival claimant [[Matilda of Hainaut]], and her husband [[Louis of Burgundy]] returned to the Morea in the spring of 1316 with Venetian aid. Ferdinand's expected aid from Majorca and Sicily was tardy, as was that of the [[Catalan Company]] from [[Athens]]. Facing superior numbers, he was killed at the [[Battle of Manolada]] on July 5, 1316. He was succeeded as [[heir presumptive]] of Majorca by his elder son, the future King [[James III of Majorca|James III]], and as Viscount of Aumelas by his posthumous son, Ferdinand.

'''Francis Balfour''' ({{circa|1744}} – 7 May 1818) was a Scottish medical officer and medical author who lived and worked primarily in [[British India]].

==Biography==
Balfour was born in [[Fife]], the third son of Army officer Arthur Balfour, the great-grandson of the [[John Balfour, 3rd Lord Balfour of Burleigh|3rd Lord Balfour of Burleigh]] by his second son, Lt. Col. John Balfour.&lt;ref name="burkes"&gt;{{cite book |title=Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage |date=1914 |publisher=Burke's Peerage Limited |page=169 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RVggAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=francis+balfour+7+may+1818 |accessdate=17 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lt. Col. John Balfour was attainted for his role in the [[Jacobite rising of 1715]], and his lands forefeited. King [[George II of the United Kingdom|George II]] restored the [[Fernie Castle|Fernie estate]] to Arthur in 1739.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lords |first1=Great Britain Parliament House of |title=Journals of the House of Lords |date=1861 |publisher=H.M. Stationery Office |page=318 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGyyu0d2LS8C&amp;pg=PA318&amp;dq=john+balfour+estate+fernie+restore+george&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjepcPXidzbAhUPUK0KHWPuAMUQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=18 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degree by [[Edinburgh University]] in 1767; his thesis was titled ''De Gonorrhea virulenta''. He entered the [[East India Company]]'s service in [[Bengal]] as assistant-surgeon on 3 July 1769, was appointed full surgeon on 10 August 1777, and retired from the service on 16 September 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell and Miles' Indian Medical Officers, 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; He afterwards returned to [[Edinburgh]].

Balfour lived for several years on terms of some intimacy with [[Warren Hastings]]. He dedicated a book — ''The Forms of Herkern'' — to him in 1781, and addressed him a letter in the same year complaining of the want of courtesy shown him by other officials in the East India service at [[Lucknow]].&lt;ref&gt;Addit. MS. 29151, f. 109&lt;/ref&gt; In May, June, and July 1783, Balfour, while at [[Benares]], corresponded frequently with Hastings in an abortive attempt to disclose a plot between the resident of Benares, [[Francis Fowke]], and [[Rajah Cheyte Sing]], which he claimed to have discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Addit. MSS. 29159, ff. 257, 388, 394, 400; 29160, ff. 49, 50, 69, 83, 104, 116&lt;/ref&gt; Balfour not only interested himself in politics and medicine, but devoted much time to [[Oriental studies]].

''The Forms of Herkern . . . translated into English'', was published at [[Calcutta]] in 1781, and republished in London in 1804. It is a state letter-writer in [[Persian language|Persian]]; a vocabulary is given by the translator at the end. Balfour was one of the earliest members of the [[Bengal Asiatic Society]], founded, under the presidency of Sir William Jones and the patronage of Warren Hastings, in 1784. To the 'Asiatic Researches' ('Transactions of the Bengal Asiatic Society') Balfour contributed in 1790 a paper on [[Arabic language|Arabic roots]], showing how the Arabic language had entered into the Persian and the [[language of Hindostan]],&lt;ref&gt;ii. 205&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1805 a paper entitled 'Extracts from Tehzeebul Mantik; or the Essence of Logic, proposed as a small supplement to Arabic and [[Persian Grammar]], and with a view to elucidate certain points connected with [[Oriental Literature]]'.&lt;ref&gt;viii. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Balfour married a cousin, Emilia Balfour, in Madras in 1777.&lt;ref&gt;''India, Select Marriages, 1792-1948''&lt;/ref&gt; He succeeded to the Fernie estate following the death of his brother. He died there in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crawford |first1=Lieutenant-Colonel D.

'''Frankenstein's monster''', often erroneously referred to as "'''Frankenstein'''", is a fictional character who first appeared in [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]''. Shelley's title thus compares the monster's creator, [[Victor Frankenstein]], to the mythological character [[Prometheus]], who fashioned humans out of clay and gave them fire.   

In Shelley's [[Gothic fiction|Gothic story]], Victor Frankenstein builds the creature in his [[laboratory]] through an ambiguous method consisting of [[chemistry]] and [[alchemy]]. Shelley describes the monster as {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}, hideously ugly, but sensitive and emotional.  The monster attempts to fit into human society but is shunned, which leads him to seek revenge against Frankenstein. According to the scholar [[Joseph Carroll (scholar)|Joseph Carroll]], the monster occupies "a border territory between the characteristics that typically define protagonists and antagonists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Joseph|last1=Carroll|authorlink=Joseph Carroll (scholar)|first2=Jonathan|last2=Gottschall|first3=John A.|last3=Johnson|first4=Daniel J.|last4=Kruger|title=Graphing Jane Austen: The Evolutionary Basis of Literary Meaning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TZtiAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke, England|date=2012|ISBN=978-1137002402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Shelley's original novel never ascribes an actual name to the monster; although when speaking to his creator, [[Victor Frankenstein]], the monster does say "I ought to be thy [[Adam]]" (in reference to the first man created in the [[Bible]]).  Victor refers to his creation as "creature", "fiend", "spectre", "the [[demon]]", "wretch", "[[devil]]", "thing", "being", and "[[ogre]]".&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;{{cite book|last=Baldick|first=Chris|title=In Frankenstein's shadow: myth, monstrosity, and nineteenth-century writing|year=1987|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|id={{ISBN|0198117264}} |isbn=9780198117261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has become common to refer to the creature by the name "Frankenstein" or "The Monster" but neither of these names is apparent in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Stewart|last=Ja|url=http://screenrant.com/best-facts-victor-frankenstein-monster-trivia-movies-books/|title=10 Facts You Need To Know About Frankenstein (And His Monster)|website=[[Screen Rant]]|date=November 27, 2015|access-date=July 13, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in Shelley's story, the creature's namelessness became a central part of the stage adaptations in London and Paris during the decades after the novel's first appearance.  In 1823, Shelley herself attended a performance of [[Richard Brinsley Peake]]'s ''[[Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein|Presumption]]'', the first successful stage adaptation of her novel. "The play bill amused me extremely, for in the list of [[dramatis personae]] came _________, by Mr T. Cooke," she wrote to her friend [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]]. "This nameless mode of naming the unnameable is rather good."&lt;ref name=Haggerty&gt;{{cite book|first=George E.|last=Haggerty|title=Gothic Fiction/Gothic Form|url=http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Articles/haggerty.html|date=1989|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park, Pennsylvania|isbn=978-0271006451|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a decade of publication, the name of the creator—Frankenstein—was used to refer to the creature, but it did not become firmly established until much later. The story was adapted for the stage in 1927 by [[Peggy Webling]],&lt;ref name=Hitchcock&gt;{{cite book|last=Hitchcock|first=Susan Tyler|title=Frankenstein: a cultural history|date=2007|publisher=W. W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=9780393061444|id={{ISBN|0393061442}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Webling's Victor Frankenstein does give the creature his name. However, the creature has no name in the [[Universal Studios|Universal]] film series starring [[Boris Karloff]] during the 1930s, which was largely based upon Webling's play.&lt;ref&gt;Young, William and Young, Nancy.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=vrK1dFXqT78C&amp;pg=PA199 ''The 1930s''], p. 199 (Greenwood Publishing Group 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 Universal film]] treated the creature's identity in a similar way as Shelley's novel: in the opening credits, the character is referred to merely as "The Monster" (the actor's name is replaced by a question mark, but Karloff is listed in the closing credits).&lt;ref&gt;Schor, Esther. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0QeWS3z0BwC&amp;pg=PA82 ''The Cambridge Companion to Mary Shelley''], p. 82 (Cambridge U. Press 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the creature soon enough became best known in the popular imagination as "Frankenstein". This usage is sometimes considered erroneous, but some usage commentators regard the monster sense of "Frankenstein" as well-established and not an error.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Bergen|title=Comfortable Words|year=1962|publisher=New York|location=Random House}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garner&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|title=A dictionary of modern American usage|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|id={{ISBN|0195078535}}|isbn=9780195078534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern practice varies somewhat. For example, in ''[[Dean Koontz's Frankenstein]]'', first published in 2004, the creature is named "Deucalion", after the [[Deucalion|character]] from [[Greek Mythology]], who is the son of the titan [[Prometheus]], a reference to the original novel's title.  Another example is the second episode of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'', which first aired in 2014; Victor Frankenstein briefly considers naming his creation "Adam", before deciding instead to let the monster "pick his own name". Thumbing through a book of the works of [[William Shakespeare]], the monster chooses "Proteus" from ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]''. It is later revealed that Proteus is actually the ''second'' monster Frankenstein has created, with the first, abandoned creation having been named "Caliban", from ''[[The Tempest]]'', by the theatre actor who took him in and later, after leaving the theatre, named himself after the English poet [[John Clare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/penny-dreadful/236468/penny-dreadful-the-most-faithful-version-of-the-frankenstein-legend|title=Penny Dreadful: The Most Faithful Version of the Frankenstein Legend|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shelley's plot==
[[Image:Frankenstein1910.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Stanton Ogle]] in the [[Frankenstein (1910 film)|1910 film version]]]]
{{main|Frankenstein}}
As told by Mary Shelley, Victor Frankenstein builds the creature in the attic of his boarding house through an ambiguously described [[scientific method]] consisting of [[chemistry]] (from his time as a student at [[University of Ingolstadt]]) and [[alchemy]] (largely based on the writings of [[Paracelsus]], [[Albertus Magnus]], and [[Cornelius Agrippa]]). Frankenstein is disgusted by his creation, however, and flees from it in horror. Frightened, and unaware of his own identity, the monster wanders through the wilderness.

He finds brief solace beside a remote cottage inhabited by a family of [[peasant]]s.  Eavesdropping, the creature familiarizes himself with their lives and learns to speak, whereby he becomes eloquent, educated, and well-mannered. The creature eventually introduces himself to the family's [[blindness|blind]] father, who treats him with kindness. When the rest of the family returns, however, they are frightened of him and drive him away. Hopeful but bewildered, the creature rescues a peasant girl from a river but is shot in the shoulder by a man who claims her. He finds Frankenstein's journal in the pocket of the jacket he found in the laboratory, and swears revenge on his creator for leaving him alone in a world that hates him.

The monster kills Victor's younger brother William upon learning of the boy's relation to his hated creator. When Frankenstein retreats to the mountains, the monster approaches him at the summit and asks his creator to build him a female mate. In return, he promises to disappear with his mate and never trouble humankind again; the monster then threatens to destroy everything Frankenstein holds dear should he fail. Frankenstein agrees and builds a female creature, but, aghast at the possibility of creating a race of monsters, destroys his experiment. In response, the monster kills Frankenstein's best friend Henry Clerval, and later kills Frankenstein's bride [[Elizabeth Lavenza]] on their wedding night; whereupon Frankenstein's father dies of grief. Frankenstein dedicates himself to destroying his creation. Searching for the monster in the [[Arctic Circle]], Frankenstein falls into the freezing water, contracting severe [[pneumonia]]. A ship exploring the region encounters the dying Frankenstein, who relates his story to the ship's captain, Robert Walton. Later, the monster boards the ship; but, upon finding Frankenstein dead, is overcome by grief and pledges to incinerate himself at "the Northernmost extremity of the globe". He then departs, never to be seen again.

==Appearance==
[[Image:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Boris Karloff]] as the classic 1930s film version with an assist from [[makeup artist]] [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack Pierce]]]]
[[File:Frankenstein 1896.jpg|thumb|Frankenstein's monster in an editorial cartoon, 1896]]
Shelley described Frankenstein's monster as an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} creature of hideous contrasts:&lt;blockquote&gt;His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.&lt;/blockquote&gt;A picture of the creature appeared in the 1831 edition. Early stage portrayals dressed him in a toga, shaded, along with the monster's skin, a pale blue. Throughout the 19th century, the monster's image remained variable according to the artist.

The best-known image of Frankenstein's monster in [[popular culture]] derives from [[Boris Karloff]]'s portrayal in the 1931 movie ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]],'' in which he wore makeup applied, and according to a format designed by, [[Jack Pierce (makeup artist)|Jack P. Pierce]] and possibly suggested by director [[James Whale]]. [[Universal Studios]], which released the film, was quick to secure ownership of the copyright for the makeup format. Karloff played the monster in two more Universal films, ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]''; [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]] took over the part from Karloff in ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]];'' [[Bela Lugosi]] portrayed the role in ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]];'' and [[Glenn Strange]] played the monster in the last three [[Universal Studios]] films to feature the character - ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]],'' ''[[House of Dracula]],'' and ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]].'' But their makeup replicated the iconic look first worn by Karloff. To this day, the image of Karloff's face is owned by his daughter's company, Karloff Enterprises, for which Universal replaced Karloff's features with Glenn Strange's in most of their marketing.

Since Karloff's portrayal, the creature almost always appears as a towering, [[undead]]-like figure, often with a flat-topped angular head and bolts on his neck to serve as electrical connectors or grotesque electrodes. He wears a dark, usually tattered, suit having shortened coat sleeves and thick, heavy boots, causing him to walk with an awkward, stiff-legged gait (as opposed to the novel, in which he is described as much more flexible than a human). The tone of his skin varies (although shades of green or gray are common), and his body appears stitched together at certain parts (such as around the neck and joints). This image has influenced the creation of other fictional characters, such as [[Hulk (comics)|the Hulk]].&lt;ref name="OyVey"&gt;{{Cite book| last=Weinstein | first=Simcha | title=Up, Up, and Oy Vey!: how Jewish history, culture, and values shaped the comic book superhero | publisher=Leviathan Press | year=2006 | location=Baltimore, Maryland | pages=82–97 | isbn=978-1-881927-32-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1973 TV mini-series ''[[Frankenstein: The True Story]],'' a different approach was taken in depicting the monster: [[Michael Sarrazin]] appears as a strikingly handsome man who later degenerates into a grotesque monster due to a flaw in the creation process.

In the 1994 film ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (film)|Mary Shelley's Frankenstein]],'' the creature is played by [[Robert De Niro]] in a nearer approach to the original source, except this version gives the creature balding grey hair and a body covered in bloody stitches. He is, as in the novel, motivated by pain and loneliness. In this version, Frankenstein gives the monster the brain of his mentor, [[Doctor Waldman]], while his body is made from a man who killed Waldman while resisting a vaccination. The monster retains Waldman's "trace memories" that apparently help him quickly learn to speak and read.

In the 2004 film ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]],'' the monster is shown in a modernized version of the Karloff design. He is {{convert|8|to(-)|9|ft|cm}} tall, has a square bald head, gruesome scars, and pale green skin. The electricity is emphasized with one electrified dome in the back of his head and another over his heart. It also has hydraulic pistons in its legs, essentially rendering the design as a steam-punk cyborg. Although not as eloquent as in the novel, this version of the creature is intelligent and relatively nonviolent.

In 2004, a TV mini-series adaptation of ''[[Frankenstein (US TV miniseries)|Frankenstein]]'' was made by [[Hallmark Channel|Hallmark]]. [[Luke Goss]] plays The Creature. This adaptation more closely resembles the monster as described in the novel: intelligent and articulate, with flowing, dark hair and watery eyes.

The 2014 TV series ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]'' also rejects the Karloff design in favor of Shelley's description. This version of the creature has the flowing dark hair described by Shelley, although he departs from her description by having pale grey skin and obvious scars along the right side of his face. In this series, the monster names himself "[[Caliban]]", after the character in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Tempest]]''. In the series, Victor Frankenstein makes a second and third creature, each more indistinguishable from normal human beings.

==Personality==
[[File:House of Frankenstein (Strange and Karloff).jpg|right|thumb|[[Glenn Strange]] as Frankenstein's monster with [[Boris Karloff]], this time playing another character, in the 1944 film ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'']] 
[[File:Curse of Frankenstein 1957.jpg|thumb|[[Christopher Lee]] as the creature in the [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer's]] ''[[The Curse of Frankenstein]]'' (1957)]]
As depicted by Shelley, the monster is a sensitive, emotional creature whose only aim is to share his life with another sentient being like himself. The novel and film versions portrayed him as versed in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', ''[[Plutarch's Lives]]'', and ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]''.

From the beginning, the monster is rejected by everyone he meets. He realizes from the moment of his "birth" that even his own creator cannot stand being around him; this is obvious when Frankenstein says "…one hand was stretched out, seemingly to detain me, but I escaped…".&lt;ref name=Shelley&gt;{{cite web|last=Shelley|first=Mary Wollstonecraft|title=Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm|work=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Ch.5}} Upon seeing his own reflection, he realizes that he too cannot stand to see himself. His greatest desire is to find love and acceptance; but when that desire is denied, he swears revenge on his creator.

Contrary to many film versions, the creature in the novel is very articulate and eloquent in his way of speaking. Almost immediately after his creation, he dresses himself; and within 11 months, he can speak and read German and French. By the end of the novel, the creature appears able to speak English fluently as well. The ''Van Helsing'' and ''Penny Dreadful'' interpretations of the character have similar personalities to the literary original, although the latter version is the only one to retain the character's violent reactions to rejection.

In the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaptation]], the monster is depicted as [[Muteness|mute]] and bestial; it is implied that this is because he is accidentally implanted with a criminal's "abnormal" brain. In the subsequent sequel, ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', the monster learns to speak, albeit in short, stunted sentences. In the second sequel, ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'', the creature is again rendered inarticulate. Following a brain transplant in the third sequel, ''[[The Ghost of Frankenstein]]'', the monster speaks with the voice and personality of the brain donor. This was continued after a fashion in the scripting for the fourth sequel, ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'', but the dialogue was excised before release. The monster was effectively mute in later sequels, though he is heard to refer to [[Count Dracula]] as his "master" in ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]''. The monster is often portrayed as being [[Pyrophobia|afraid of fire]].

==The monster as a metaphor==
[[File:Museo Nazionale del Cinema, Turin (5282830195).jpg|thumb|upright|Frankenstein's monster's bust in the [[National Museum of Cinema]] of [[Turin]], [[Italy]]]]
Scholars sometimes look for deeper meaning in Shelley’s story, and have analogized the monster to a motherless child; Shelley’s own mother died while giving birth to her.&lt;ref name=Milner&gt;Milner, Andrew. ''Literature, Culture and Society,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=QW9C1Xdzyx4C&amp;pg=PA227 227, 230] (Psychology Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  The monster has also been analogized to an oppressed class; Shelley wrote that the monster recognized "the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid poverty."&lt;ref name=Milner /&gt;  Others see in the monster the tragic results of uncontrolled scientific progress,&lt;ref&gt;Coghill, Jeff.  ''CliffsNotes on Shelley's Frankenstein,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=jSHM5oZd8WkC&amp;pg=PA30 p. 30] (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; especially as at the time of publishing, [[Galvanism]] had convinced many scientists that raising the dead through use of electrical currents was a scientific possibility.

Another proposal is that the character of Dr. Frankenstein was based upon a real scientist who had a similar name, and who had been called a modern Prometheus--[[Benjamin Franklin]]. Accordingly, the monster would represent the new nation that Franklin helped to create out of remnants left by England.&lt;ref name=Young&gt;Young, Elizabeth. [https://books.google.com/books?id=65fCSOpahAwC&amp;pg=PA34 Black Frankenstein: The Making of an American Metaphor], p. 34 (NYU Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Victor Frankenstein's father "made also a kite, with a wire and string, which drew down that fluid from the clouds," wrote Shelley, similar to Franklin's famous [[kite experiment]].&lt;ref name=Young /&gt;

'''''Future Evolution''''' is a book written by [[paleontologist]] [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]] and illustrated by [[Alexis Rockman]]. He addresses his own opinion of [[future]] [[evolution]] and compares it with [[Dougal Dixon]]'s ''[[After Man: A Zoology of the Future]]'' and [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[The Time Machine]]''.

According to Ward, humanity may exist for a long time. Nevertheless, we are impacting our world. He splits his book in different chronologies, starting with the near future (the next 1,000 years). Humanity would be struggling to support a massive [[human population|population]] of 11 billion. [[Global warming]] raises sea levels. The [[ozone]] layer weakens. Most of the available [[land (economics)|land]] is devoted to [[agriculture]] due to the demand for [[food]]. Despite all this, the [[Marine ecosystem|oceanic wildlife]] remains untethered by most of these impacts, specifically the [[fish farming|commercial farmed fish]]. This is, according to Ward, an era of [[extinction]] that would last about 10 million years (note that many [[Holocene extinction|human-caused extinctions]] have already occurred). After that, the world gets stranger.

Ward labels the species that have the potential to survive in a human-infested world. These include [[dandelion]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[owl]]s, [[pig]]s, [[cattle]], [[rat]]s, [[snake]]s, and [[crow]]s to name but a few. In the human-infested [[ecosystem]], those preadapted to live amongst man survived and prospered. Ward describes [[garbage dump]]s in the future infested with multiple species of rats, a snake with a sticky frog-like tongue to snap up rodents, and pigs with snouts specialized for rooting through garbage. The story's time traveller who views this new refuse-covered habitat is gruesomely attacked by ravenous flesh-eating crows.

Ward then questions the potential for humanity to evolve into a new species. According to him, this is incredibly unlikely. For this to happen a human population must isolate itself and [[interbreed]] until it becomes a new species. Then he questions if humanity would survive or extinguish itself by [[climate change]], [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], [[disease]], or the posing threat of [[nanotechnology]] as terrorist weapons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6977">'''George David Exoo''' (August 22, 1942–May 26, 2015) was an [[Ohio]]-born [[Unitarian Universalist]] minister and [[assisted suicide]] activist. He was originally a Methodist and had a doctorate in music history from [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He became a Unitarian Universalist minister in 1973, but did not appear to be in ministry at the time of his death. 

He began his involvement with assisted suicide after a member of his congregation made remarks about a man he'd counselled who had committed suicide.&lt;ref name=gaston-gazette-gastonia/&gt; In 1982 he joined the [[Hemlock Society]] and later he joined [[Final Exit Network]].&lt;ref name=gaston-gazette-gastonia/&gt; The first suicide he assisted occurred in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/110011687.html?dids=110011687:110011687&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Mar+03%2C+2002&amp;author=JENNIFER+BUNDY&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=THE+NATION%3B+Irish+Suicide+Raises+New+Issues+for+Minister&amp;pqatl=google ''Los Angeles Times'' (March 3, 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to have assisted in 102 other suicides.

==AIDS activist and residency at the New Vrindaban "City of God"==

Exoo studied under [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]] at [[Harvard University]], and did his doctoral work in religion and society at the [[Graduate Theological Union]]. He was ordained a minister by the [[Unitarian Universalists]].&lt;ref&gt;George Exoo, letter to Larry Shinn (June 7, 1990) found in the New Vrindaban Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Charleston, South Carolina]], where he led a Unitarian congregation, he distributed free condoms to homosexual men in the 1980s at restrooms at South Carolina freeway rest stops. In August 1989, he visited the [[New Vrindaban]] [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] community in [[Marshall County, West Virginia]], and became attracted by the vision of an interfaith community as described by the community's founder, [[Kirtanananda Swami Bhaktipada]]. He moved to the community in June 1990, determined to create a hospice for AIDS victims, and in October 1990, along with two other interfaith residents, incorporated his own church, "The Interfaith Friends", a federation of Unitarian-Universalism, Taoism and Quakers. &lt;ref&gt;“‘Interfaith Friends’ Becomes City of God’s First Affiliate Church,” ''The City of God Examiner'', no. 40 (October 24, 1990), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by early 1991, he became disturbed by the "totalitarian control by the Swami", and the "lack of integrity, blatant corruption, deceit, theft, and the gross abuse of the mental and physical well being of its own residents."&lt;ref&gt;George Exoo, cited in “Banished Minister Claims Krishnas Need Trustee to Manage Community,” ''Wheeling News Register'' (c. April 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Exoo (and his partner Thomas McGurrin, a former Krishna devotee) left the community and moved to [[Beckley, West Virginia]], where he led a Unitarian congregation. In June 1992, ''In Pittsburgh'' magazine published an article by Exoo titled "The City of Fraud" in which he told the tale of betrayal and threatened physical harm he experienced while living at the New Vrindaban "City of God".&lt;ref&gt;“How the City of God Became a City of Fraud”, ''In Pittsburgh'' (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania: June 4–10, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extradition request from Irish government== 
In January 2002 the Irish authorities wanted Exoo for assisting the suicide of Rosemary Toole. The United States arrested him, but ultimately refused extradition on the grounds that Irish and American law in this area were not compatible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herald.ie/opinion/comment/her-death-was-unlawful-if-exoo-differs-i-invite-him-back-here-to-explain-why-not-1741707.html "Her death was unlawful... if Exoo differs I invite him back here to explain why not"], PJ Browne, ''[[Evening Herald]]'', May 16, 2009; retrieved May 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Exoo declined to attend the inquest into Toole's death on legal advice.&lt;ref name="independent-2009"&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/i-wont-be-back-says-righttodie-reverend-1741445.html "I won't be back, says right-to-die reverend"] by Jason O'Brien, ''[[Irish Independent]]'', May 16, 2009; retrieved May 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He stated, however, that it was unlikely he would work with Irish citizens in the future, as he considered it too dangerous.&lt;ref name="independent-2009"/&gt;

Although he had supporters, there were concerns within the right-to-die community that Exoo assisted suicides of individuals who did not have terminal or debilitating illness.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/may/12/mentalhealth.health "I make it look like they died in their sleep"] by [[Jon Ronson]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', May 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage by Jon Ronson==
[[Jon Ronson]] profiled him in [[Channel 4]] documentary ''Reverend Death''.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/R/reverend_death ''Reverend Death'']&lt;/ref&gt; Exoo claimed to have helped 103 people commit suicide, although [[Jon Ronson]] claims that most of Exoo's clients were suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] or psychosomatic illnesses, not terminal illnesses, including Toole.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

==Property in Gastonia==
Exoo bought a property in [[Gastonia, North Carolina]], in 2007, with the intent of using part of it as a place for terminally ill patients to end their lives.&lt;ref name=gaston-gazette-gastonia&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gastongazette.com/news/ireland-50693-property-right.html |title=Suicide center man's solution for Gastonia property |author=Diane Turbyfill |publisher=[[The Gaston Gazette]] |date=September 13, 2010 |accessdate=September 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920070332/http://www.gastongazette.com/news/ireland-50693-property-right.html |archivedate=September 20, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=charlotte-observer-gastonia&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/2010/09/14/1691999/reverend-wants-to-open-assisted.html |title=Reverend wants to open assisted suicide facility in Gastonia |author=Richard Devayne |publisher=[[The Charlotte Observer]] |date=September 14, 2010 |accessdate=September 14, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Georges bizet.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Georges Bizet in 1875&lt;/center&gt;]]
&lt;!-- Before considering adding an infobox, please refer to the 2013 discussion at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Georges_Bizet#Question_to_the_Consensus --&gt;
'''Georges Bizet''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɔʁʒ bizɛ|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;English approximation of the surname: {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|b|iː|z|eɪ}}, {{IPAc-en|US|b|iː|ˈ|z|eɪ}} ({{citation|last=Wells|first=John C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}).&lt;/ref&gt; 25 October 1838{{spaced ndash}}3&amp;nbsp;June 1875), registered at birth as '''Alexandre César Léopold Bizet''', was a French composer of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]]. Best known for his operas in a career cut short by his early death, Bizet achieved few successes before his final work, ''[[Carmen]]'', which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed works in the entire opera repertoire.

During a brilliant student career at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]], Bizet won many prizes, including the prestigious [[Prix de Rome]] in 1857. He was recognised as an outstanding pianist, though he chose not to capitalise on this skill and rarely performed in public. Returning to Paris after almost three years in Italy, he found that the main Parisian opera theatres preferred the established classical repertoire to the works of newcomers. His keyboard and orchestral compositions were likewise largely ignored; as a result, his career stalled, and he earned his living mainly by arranging and transcribing the music of others. Restless for success, he began many theatrical projects during the 1860s, most of which were abandoned. Neither of his two operas that reached the stage in this time—''[[Les pêcheurs de perles]]'' and ''[[La jolie fille de Perth]]''—were immediately successful.

After the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–1871, during which Bizet served in the National Guard, he had little success with his one-act opera ''[[Djamileh]]'', though an orchestral suite derived from his [[L'Arlésienne (Bizet)|incidental music]] to [[Alphonse Daudet]]'s play ''L'Arlésienne'' was instantly popular. The production of Bizet's final opera, ''Carmen'', was delayed because of fears that its themes of betrayal and murder would offend audiences. After its premiere on 3 March 1875, Bizet was convinced that the work was a failure; he died of a heart attack three months later, unaware that it would prove a spectacular and enduring success.

Bizet's marriage to [[Geneviève Halévy]] was intermittently happy and produced one son. After his death, his work, apart from ''Carmen'', was generally neglected. Manuscripts were given away or lost, and published versions of his works were frequently revised and adapted by other hands. He founded no school and had no obvious disciples or successors. After years of neglect, his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century. Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature death was a significant loss to French musical theatre.

==Life==

===Early years===

====Family background and childhood====
Georges Bizet was born in Paris on 25 October 1838. He was registered as Alexandre César Léopold, but baptised as "Georges" on 16 March 1840, and was known by this name for the rest of his life. His father, Adolphe Bizet, had been a hairdresser and wigmaker before becoming a singing teacher despite his lack of formal training.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He also composed a few works, including at least one published song.&lt;ref name= C7&gt;Curtiss, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1837, Adolphe married Aimée Delsarte, against the wishes of her family who considered him a poor prospect; the Delsartes, though impoverished, were a cultured and highly musical family.&lt;ref name= D2&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt; Aimée was an accomplished pianist, while her brother [[François Delsarte]] was a distinguished singer and teacher who performed at the courts of both [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]] and [[Napoleon III]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 8–10&lt;/ref&gt; François Delsarte's wife Rosine, a musical prodigy, had been an assistant professor of [[solfeggio|solfège]] at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]] at the age of 13.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; At least one author has alleged that his mother was from a Jewish family but this is not substantiated in any of his official biographies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9YZgJW1u9vYC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;lpg=PA123#v=onepage&amp;q=bizet+jewish|title=Tchaikovsky: Symphony No. 6 (Pathétique)|first=Timothy L.|last=Jackson|date=7 October 1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=17 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Bohlman]], ''Jewish Musical Modernism, Old and New'', University of Chicago Press (2008), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Georges, an only child,&lt;ref name= D2/&gt; showed early aptitude for music and quickly picked up the basics of musical notation from his mother, who probably gave him his first piano lessons.&lt;ref name= C7/&gt; By listening at the door of the room where Adolphe conducted his classes, Georges learned to sing difficult songs accurately from memory and developed an ability to identify and analyse complex [[chord (music)|chordal structures]]. This precocity convinced his ambitious parents that he was ready to begin studying at the Conservatoire even though he was still only nine years old (the minimum entry age was 10). Georges was interviewed by [[Joseph Meifred]], the [[French horn|horn]] virtuoso who was a member of the Conservatoire's Committee of Studies. Meifred was so struck by the boy's demonstration of his skills that he waived the age rule and offered to take him as soon as a place became available.&lt;ref name= D2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conservatoire====
[[File:Theatre du Conservatoire Paris CNSAD.jpg|thumb|left|Part of the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]], where Bizet studied from 1848 to 1857 (photographed in 2009)]]
Bizet was admitted to the Conservatoire on 9 October 1848, two weeks before his 10th birthday.&lt;ref name= D2/&gt; He made an early impression; within six months he had won first prize in solfège, a feat that impressed [[Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume Zimmerman]], the Conservatoire's former professor of piano. Zimmerman gave Bizet private lessons in [[counterpoint]] and [[fugue]], which continued until the old man's death in 1853.&lt;ref name= OMO&gt;{{cite web|last= Macdonald|first= Hugh|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/51829?q=Georges+Bizet&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1|title= Bizet, Georges (Alexandre-César-Léopold)|publisher= Oxford Music Online|accessdate= 18 September 2011}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through these classes, Bizet met Zimmerman's son-in-law, the composer [[Charles Gounod]], who became a lasting influence on the young pupil's musical style—although their relationship was often strained in later years.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; He also met another of Gounod's young students, the 13-year-old [[Camille Saint-Saëns]], who remained a firm friend of Bizet's.  Under the tuition of [[Antoine François Marmontel]], the Conservatoire's professor of piano, Bizet's pianism developed rapidly; he won the Conservatoire's second prize for piano in 1851, and first prize the following year. Bizet would later write to Marmontel: "In your class one learns something besides the piano; one becomes a musician".&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his first year, Bizet was required to submit a religious composition, but due to his atheism, he declined and wrote instead an opera, ''The Pearlfishers'', which was accepted by the committee.&lt;ref&gt;"The Pearl Fishers – Georges Bizet". Virginia Opera. Retrieved 19 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Aged Charles Gounod.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Gounod]], depicted here in later life, was a mentor and inspiration to Bizet in the latter's Conservatoire years.]]
Bizet's first preserved compositions, two wordless songs for [[soprano]], date from around 1850. In 1853, he joined [[Fromental Halévy]]'s composition class and began to produce works of increasing sophistication and quality.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his songs, "Petite Marguerite" and "La Rose et l'abeille", were published in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 153, 266–67&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, he wrote an ambitious overture for a large orchestra,&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 138–39, 262–63&lt;/ref&gt; and prepared four-hand piano versions of two of Gounod's works: the opera ''[[La nonne sanglante]]'' and the Symphony in D. Bizet's work on the Gounod symphony inspired him, shortly after his seventeenth birthday, to write [[Symphony in C (Bizet)|his own symphony]], which bore a close resemblance to Gounod's—note for note in some passages. Bizet's symphony was subsequently lost, rediscovered in 1933 and finally performed in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856, Bizet competed for the prestigious [[Prix de Rome]]. His entry was not successful, but nor were any of the others; the musician's prize was not awarded that year.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; After this rebuff, Bizet entered an opera competition which [[Jacques Offenbach]] had organised for young composers, with a prize of 1,200 [[franc#French franc|francs]]. The challenge was to set the one-act [[libretto]] of ''[[Le docteur Miracle]]'' by Léon Battu and [[Ludovic Halévy]]. The prize was awarded jointly to Bizet and [[Charles Lecocq]],&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; a compromise which years later Lecocq criticised on the grounds of the jury's manipulation by Fromental Halévy in favour of Bizet.{{refn|Lecocq wrote: "Bizet's score was not bad, but rather heavy, and he failed with almost all of the little couplets I was able to bring off". Mina Curtiss suggests that this pique reflected Lecocq's general disappointment with a career in which theatrical success largely eluded him.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} As a result of his success, Bizet became a regular guest at Offenbach's Friday evening parties, where among other musicians he met the aged [[Gioachino Rossini]], who presented the young man with a signed photograph.&lt;ref name= D10&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Although Bizet was initially flattered to be part of Offenbach's circle, and relished the contacts he made at the Friday gatherings, he became resentful of the hold which the older composer had established over French musical theatre, and grew contemptuous of his music. In a letter to [[Paul Lacombe]] in 1871 Bizet refers to "the ever-increasing invasion of that infernal Offenbach", and dismisses Offenbach's work as "trash" and "this obscenity".&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 311–12&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Bizet was a great admirer of Rossini's music, and wrote not long after their first meeting that "Rossini is the greatest of them all, because like Mozart, he has all the virtues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Curtiss|first= Mina|title= Bizet, Offenbach, and Rossini|journal= The Musical Quarterly|volume= 40|issue= 3|date= July 1954|pages= 350–59 | jstor = 740074|doi=10.1093/mq/xl.3.350}}{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his 1857 Prix de Rome entry, Bizet, with Gounod's enthusiastic approval, chose to set the [[cantata]] ''Clovis et Clotilde'' by Amédée Burion. Bizet was awarded the prize after a ballot of the members of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] overturned the judges' initial decision, which was in favour of the oboist Charles Colin. Under the terms of the award, Bizet received a financial grant for five years, the first two to be spent in Rome, the third in Germany and the final two in Paris. The only other requirement was the submission each year of an "envoi", a piece of original work to the satisfaction of the Académie. Before his departure for Rome in December 1857, Bizet's prize cantata was performed at the Académie to an enthusiastic reception.&lt;ref name= D10/&gt;&lt;ref name= Curtiss48&gt;Curtiss, pp. 48–50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome, 1858–1860===
[[File:Villa Medicis.jpg|thumb|The Villa Medici, the official home of the French Académie in Rome since 1803]]
On 27 January 1858, Bizet arrived at the [[Villa Medici]], a 16th-century palace that since 1803 had housed the French Académie in Rome and which he described in a letter home as "paradise".&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Under its director, the painter [[Jean-Victor Schnetz]], the villa provided an ideal environment in which Bizet and his fellow-laureates could pursue their artistic endeavours. Bizet relished the convivial atmosphere, and quickly involved himself in the distractions of its social life; in his first six months in Rome, his only composition was a ''[[Te Deum]]'' written for the Rodrigues Prize, a competition for a new religious work open to Prix de Rome winners. This piece failed to impress the judges, who awarded the prize to Adrien Barthe, the only other entrant.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 15 and 21&lt;/ref&gt; Bizet was discouraged to the extent that he vowed to write no more religious music. His ''Te Deum'' remained forgotten and unpublished until 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink= Edward Greenfield|last= Greenfield|first= Edward|title= Bizet&amp;nbsp;– Clovis et Clotilde. Te Deum|url= http://www.gramophone.co.uk/features/focus/the-new-gramophone-digital-archive |journal= Gramophone|date= February 2011}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the winter of 1858–59, Bizet worked on his first envoi, an [[opera buffa]] setting of Carlo Cambiaggio's libretto ''[[Don Procopio]]''. Under the terms of his prize, Bizet's first envoi was supposed to be a mass, but after his ''Te Deum'' experience, he was averse to writing religious music. He was apprehensive about how this breach of the rules would be received at the Académie, but their response to ''Don Procopio'' was initially positive, with praise for the composer's "easy and brilliant touch" and "youthful and bold style".&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Young Georges Bizet.png|thumb|left|upright|Georges Bizet photographed in about 1860]]
For his second envoi, not wishing to test the Académie's tolerance too far, Bizet proposed to submit a quasi-religious work in the form of a secular mass on a text by [[Horace]]. This work, entitled ''Carmen Saeculare'', was intended as a song to [[Apollo]] and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. No trace exists, and it is unlikely that Bizet ever started it.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 94–95&lt;/ref&gt; A tendency to conceive ambitious projects, only to quickly abandon them, became a feature of Bizet's Rome years; in addition to ''Carmen Saeculare'', he considered and discarded at least five opera projects, two attempts at a symphony, and a symphonic ode on the theme of [[Odysseus#Journey home to Ithaca|Ulysses and Circe]].&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 20, 260–66, 270–71&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Don Procopio'', Bizet completed only one further work in Rome, the symphonic poem ''Vasco da Gama''. This replaced ''Carmen Saeculare'' as his second envoi, and was well received by the Académie, though swiftly forgotten thereafter.&lt;ref name= C106&gt;Curtiss, pp. 106–07&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1859, Bizet and several companions travelled in the mountains and forests around [[Anagni]] and [[Frosinone]]. They also visited a convict settlement at [[Anzio]]; Bizet sent an enthusiastic letter to Marmontel, recounting his experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In August, he made an extended journey south to [[Naples]] and [[Pompeii]], where he was unimpressed with the former but delighted with the latter: "Here you live with the ancients; you see their temples, their theatres, their houses in which you find their furniture, their kitchen utensils..."&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Bizet began sketching a symphony based on his Italian experiences, but made little immediate headway; the project, which became his [[Roma Symphony (Bizet)|''Roma'' symphony]], was not finished until 1868.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt; On his return to Rome, Bizet successfully requested permission to extend his stay in Italy into a third year, rather than going to Germany, so that he could complete "an important work" (which has not been identified).&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1860, while visiting [[Venice]] with his friend and fellow-laureate [[Ernest Guiraud]], Bizet received news that his mother was gravely ill in Paris, and made his way home.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 97–106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergent composer===

====Paris, 1860–1863====
[[File:Théâtre Historique on the Boulevard du Temple - L'illustration 12 April 1862 - Levin p380.jpg|thumb|The Théâtre Historique in Paris, one of the homes of the Théâtre Lyrique company, pictured in 1862]]
Back in Paris with two years of his grant remaining, Bizet was temporarily secure financially and could ignore for the moment the difficulties that other young composers faced in the city.&lt;ref name= D41&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; The two state-subsidised opera houses, [[Paris Opera|the Opéra]] and the [[Opéra-Comique]],{{refn|The name "Opéra-Comique" does not imply literal "comic opera" or [[opera buffa]]. The most specific characteristic of Opéra-Comique productions was the replacement of sung [[recitative]] with spoken dialogue—the German ''[[singspiel]]'' model.&lt;ref name= Dean36&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 36–39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schonberg (Vol. I), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; |group= n}} each presented traditional repertoires that tended to stifle and frustrate new homegrown talent; only eight of the 54 Prix de Rome laureates between 1830 and 1860 had had works staged at the Opéra.&lt;ref name= Steen586&gt;Steen, p. 586&lt;/ref&gt; Although French composers were better represented at the Opéra-Comique, the style and character of productions had remained largely unchanged since the 1830s.&lt;ref name= Steen586/&gt; A number of smaller theatres catered for [[operetta]], a field in which Offenbach was then paramount,&lt;ref name= Dean36/&gt; while the [[Comédie-Italienne|Théâtre Italien]] specialised in second-rate Italian opera. The best prospect for aspirant opera composers was the [[Théâtre Lyrique]] company which, despite repeated financial crises, operated intermittently in various premises under its resourceful manager [[Léon Carvalho]].&lt;ref name= Steen586/&gt; This company had staged the first performances of Gounod's ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' and his ''[[Roméo et Juliette]]'', and of a shortened version of [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]'s ''[[Les Troyens]]''.&lt;ref name= Dean36/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neef (ed.), pp. 184, 190 and 48&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 1861, Bizet attended the Paris premiere of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]'', a performance greeted by audience riots that were stage-managed by the influential [[Jockey-Club de Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this distraction, Bizet revised his opinions of Wagner's music, which he had previously dismissed as merely eccentric. He now declared Wagner "above and beyond all living composers".&lt;ref name= C106/&gt; Thereafter, accusations of "Wagnerism" were often laid against Bizet, throughout his compositional career.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

As a pianist, Bizet had showed considerable skill from his earliest years. A contemporary asserted that he could have assured a future on the concert platform, but chose to conceal his talent "as though it were a vice".&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1861 Bizet gave a rare demonstration of his virtuoso skills when, at a dinner party at which [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] was present, he astonished everyone by playing on sight, flawlessly, one of the maestro's most difficult pieces. Liszt commented: "I thought there were only two men able to surmount the difficulties&amp;nbsp;... there are three, and&amp;nbsp;... the youngest is perhaps the boldest and most brilliant."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bizet - Les pêcheurs de perles - Scene from act II at the Metropolitan - The Victrola book of the opera.jpg|thumb|left| A scene from Act II of ''Les pêcheurs de perles'']]

Bizet's third envoi was delayed for nearly a year by the prolonged illness and death, in September 1861, of his mother.&lt;ref name= D41/&gt; He eventually submitted a trio of orchestral works: an overture entitled ''La Chasse d'Ossian'', a scherzo and a funeral march. The overture has been lost; the scherzo was later absorbed into the ''Roma'' symphony, and the funeral march music was adapted and used in a later opera.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt;&lt;ref name= D754&gt;Dean (1980), pp. 754–55&lt;/ref&gt; Bizet's fourth and final envoi, which occupied him for much of 1862, was a one-act opera, ''La guzla de l'émir''. As a state-subsidised theatre, the Opéra-Comique was obliged from time to time to stage the works of Prix de Rome laureates, and ''La guzla'' duly went into rehearsal in 1863. However, in April Bizet received an offer, which originated from [[Count Alexandre Joseph Colonna-Walewski|Count Walewski]], to compose the music for a three-act opera. This was ''[[Les pêcheurs de perles]]'', based on a libretto by [[Michel Carré]] and [[Eugène Cormon]]. Because a condition of this offer was that the opera should be the composer's first publicly staged work, Bizet hurriedly withdrew ''La guzla'' from production and incorporated parts of its music into the new opera.&lt;ref name= D754/&gt; The first performance of ''Les pêcheurs de perles'', by the Théâtre Lyrique company, was on 30 September 1863. Critical opinion was generally hostile, though Berlioz praised the work, writing that it "does M. Bizet the greatest honour".&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 140–41&lt;/ref&gt; Public reaction was lukewarm, and the opera's run ended after 18 performances. It was not performed again until 1886.&lt;ref name= D755&gt;Dean (1980), pp. 755–56&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862, Bizet had fathered a child with the family's housekeeper, Marie Reiter. The boy was brought up to believe that he was Adolphe Bizet's child; only on her deathbed in 1913 did Reiter reveal her son's true paternity.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

====Years of struggle====
[[File:Bizet caricature 1863.jpg|thumb|upright|Caricature of Bizet, 1863, from the French magazine ''Diogène'']]
When his Prix de Rome grant expired, Bizet found he could not make a living from writing music. He accepted piano pupils and some composition students, two of whom, Edmond Galabert and [[Paul Lacombe]], became his close friends.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt; He also worked as an accompanist at rehearsals and auditions for various staged works, including Berlioz's oratorio ''[[L'enfance du Christ]]'' and Gounod's opera ''[[Mireille (opera)|Mireille]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; However, his main work in this period was as an arranger of others' works. He made piano transcriptions for hundreds of operas and other pieces and prepared vocal scores and orchestral arrangements for all kinds of music.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; He was also, briefly, a music critic for ''La Revue Nationale et Étrangère'', under the assumed name of "Gaston de Betzi". Bizet's single contribution in this capacity appeared on 3 August 1867, after which he quarrelled with the magazine's new editor and resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Steen, p. 589&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1862, Bizet had been working intermittently on ''Ivan IV'', an opera based on the life of [[Ivan the Terrible]]. Carvalho failed to deliver on his promise to produce it, so in December 1865, Bizet offered it to the Opéra, which rejected it; the work remained unperformed until 1946.&lt;ref name= D755/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 261&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1866, Bizet signed another contract with Carvalho, for ''[[La jolie fille de Perth]]'', the libretto for which, by J.H. Vernoy de Saint-Georges after [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], is described by Bizet's biographer [[Winton Dean]] as "the worst Bizet was ever called upon to set".&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Problems over the casting and other issues delayed its premiere for a year before it was finally performed by the Théâtre Lyrique on 26 December 1867.&lt;ref name= D755/&gt; Its press reception was more favourable than that for any of Bizet's other operas; ''Le Ménestral's'' critic hailed the second act as "a masterpiece from beginning to end".&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the opera's success, Carvalho's financial difficulties meant a run of only 18 performances.&lt;ref name= D755/&gt;

While ''La jolie fille'' was in rehearsal, Bizet worked with three other composers, each of whom contributed a single act to a four-act operetta ''Marlborough s'en va-t-en guerre''. When the work was performed at the Théâtre de l'Athénée on 13 December 1867, it was a great success, and the ''Revue et Gazette Musicale's'' critic lavished particular praise on Bizet's act: "Nothing could be more stylish, smarter and, at the same time, more distinguished".&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 206–09&lt;/ref&gt; Bizet also found time to finish his long-gestating ''Roma'' symphony and wrote numerous keyboard works and songs. Nevertheless, this period of Bizet's life was marked by significant disappointments. At least two projected operas were abandoned with little or no work done.{{refn|Dean identifies one of these as ''Les Templiers'', libretto by Saint-Georges and Léon Halévy. Another, title unknown, was for a libretto by Arthur Leroy and [[Thomas Sauvage]].&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 79, 260–63&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Several competition entries, including a cantata and a hymn composed for the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Paris Exhibition of 1867]], were unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 194–98&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Coupe du Roi de Thulé'', his entry for an opera competition, was not placed in the first five; from the fragments of this score that survive, analysts have discerned pre-echoes of ''Carmen''.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 77–79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= D757&gt;Dean (1980), p. 757&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 February 1869, the ''Roma'' symphony was performed at the Cirque Napoléon, under [[Jules Pasdeloup]]. Afterwards, Bizet informed Galabert that on the basis of proportionate applause, hisses, and catcalls, the work was a success.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|This performance, against Bizet's wishes, omitted the scherzo that had formed part of his third envoi. The scherzo was not included in the symphony until 1880, five years after Bizet's death.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

===Marriage===
[[File:Madame Georges Bizet by Jules-Élie Delaunay (conrasted).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Geneviève Bizet, painted in 1878 by [[Jules-Élie Delaunay]].]]
Not long after Fromental Halévy's death in 1862, Bizet had been approached on behalf of Mme. Halévy about completing his old tutor's unfinished opera ''[[Noé (opera)|Noé]]''.&lt;ref name= D84&gt;Dean (1965), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Although no action was taken at that time, Bizet remained on friendly terms with the Halévy family. Fromental had left two daughters; the elder, Esther, died in 1864, an event which so traumatised Mme. Halévy that she could not tolerate the company of her younger daughter [[Geneviève Halévy|Geneviève]], who from the age of 15 lived with other family members.&lt;ref name="Dean 1965, p. 82"&gt;Dean (1965), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear when Geneviève and Bizet became emotionally attached, but in October 1867, he informed Galabert: "I have met an adorable girl whom I love! In two years she will be my wife!"&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt; The pair became engaged, although the Halévy family initially disallowed the match. According to Bizet they considered him an unsuitable catch: "penniless, left-wing, anti-religious and Bohemian",&lt;ref&gt;Steen, pp. 589–90&lt;/ref&gt; which Dean observes are odd grounds of objection from "a family bristling with artists and eccentrics".&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; By summer 1869, their objections had been overcome, and the wedding took place on 3 June 1869. Ludovic Halévy wrote in his journal: "Bizet has spirit and talent. He ''should'' succeed".&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

As a belated homage to his late father-in-law, Bizet took up the ''Noé'' manuscript and completed it. Parts of his moribund ''Vasco da Gama'' and ''Ivan IV'' were incorporated into the score, but a projected production at the Théâtre Lyrique failed to materialise when Carvalho's company finally went bankrupt, and ''Noé'' remained unperformed until 1885.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt;&lt;ref name= D84/&gt; Bizet's marriage was initially happy, but was affected by Geneviève's nervous instability (inherited from both her parents),&lt;ref name="Dean 1965, p. 82"/&gt; her difficult relations with her mother and by Mme. Halévy's interference in the couple's affairs.&lt;ref name= D757/&gt; Despite this, Bizet kept on good terms with his mother-in-law and maintained an extensive correspondence with her.&lt;ref name= Letters/&gt; In the year following the marriage, he considered plans for at least half a dozen new operas and began to sketch the music for two of them: ''Clarissa Harlowe'' based on [[Samuel Richardson]]'s novel ''[[Clarissa]]'', and ''Grisélidis'' with a libretto from [[Victorien Sardou]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 254–56&lt;/ref&gt; However, his progress on these projects was brought to a halt in July 1870, with the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

===War and upheaval===

After a series of perceived provocations from Prussia, culminating in the offer of the Spanish crown to the Prussian [[Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern|Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern]], the French Emperor Napoleon III declared war on 15 July 1870. Initially, this step was supported by an outbreak of patriotic fervour and confident expectations of victory.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steen, p. 591&lt;/ref&gt; Bizet, along with other composers and artists, joined the National Guard and began training.&lt;ref name= Curtiss259&gt;Curtiss, pp. 259–62&lt;/ref&gt; He was critical of the antiquated equipment with which he was supposed to fight; his unit's guns, he said, were more dangerous to themselves than to the enemy.&lt;ref name= Letters&gt;{{Cite journal

An armistice was signed on 26 January 1871, but the departure of the Prussian troops from Paris in March presaged a period of confusion and civil disturbance. Following an uprising, the city's municipal authority was taken over by dissidents who established the [[Paris Commune]].&lt;ref&gt;Steen, pp. 598–601&lt;/ref&gt; Bizet decided that he was no longer safe in the city, and he and Geneviève escaped to [[Compiègne]].&lt;ref name= Letters/&gt; Later, they moved to [[Le Vésinet]] where they sat out the two months of the Commune, within hearing distance of the gunfire that resounded as government troops gradually crushed the uprising: "The cannons are rumbling with unbelievable violence", Bizet wrote to his mother-in-law on 12 May.&lt;ref name= Letters/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late career===

====''Djamileh'', ''L'Arlésienne'' and ''Don Rodrigue''====
As life in Paris returned to normal, in June 1871, Bizet's appointment as chorus-master at The Opéra was seemingly confirmed by its director, [[Émile Perrin]]. Bizet was due to begin his duties in October, but on 1 November, the post was assumed by Hector Salomon. In her biography of Bizet, Mina Curtiss surmises that he either resigned or refused to take up the position as a protest against what he thought was the director's unjustified closing of [[Ernest Reyer]]'s opera ''Erostrate'' after only two performances.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 315–17&lt;/ref&gt; Bizet resumed work on ''Clarissa Harlowe'' and ''Grisélidis'', but plans for the latter to be staged at the Opéra-Comique fell through, and neither work was finished; only fragments of their music survive.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 91–95&lt;/ref&gt; Bizet's other completed works in 1871 were the piano duet entitled ''Jeux d'enfants'', and a one-act opera, ''[[Djamileh]]'', which opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. It was poorly staged and incompetently sung; at one point the leading singer missed 32 bars of music.

Bizet's next major assignment came from Carvalho, who was now managing Paris' Vaudeville theatre and wanted incidental music for [[Alphonse Daudet]]'s play ''[[L'Arlésienne (novel and play)|L'Arlésienne]]''. When the play opened on 1 October, the music was dismissed by critics as too complex for popular taste. However, encouraged by Reyer and [[Jules Massenet|Massenet]], Bizet fashioned [[L'Arlésienne (Bizet)|a four-movement suite]] from the music,&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 332–40&lt;/ref&gt; which was performed under Pasdeloup on 10 November to an enthusiastic reception.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt;{{refn|A second ''L'Arlésienne'' suite was prepared by Guiraud and performed in 1879, four years after Bizet's death. This is generally known as ''L'Arlésienne suite No. 2''.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} In the winter of 1872–73, Bizet supervised preparations for a revival of the still-absent Gounod's ''Roméo et Juliette'' at the Opéra-Comique. Relations between the two had been cool for some years, but Bizet responded positively to his former mentor's request for help, writing: "You were the beginning of my life as an artist. I spring from you".&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1872, Bizet informed Galabert: "I have just been ordered to compose three acts for the Opéra-Comique. [Henri] Meilhac and [Ludovic] Halévy are doing my piece".&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; The subject chosen for this project was [[Prosper Mérimée]]'s short novel, ''[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]''. Bizet began the music in the summer of 1873, but the Opéra-Comique's management was concerned about the suitability of this risqué story for a theatre that generally provided wholesome entertainment, and work was suspended.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schonberg (Vol. II), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Bizet then began composing ''Don Rodrigue'', an adaptation of the [[El Cid]] story by [[Louis Gallet]] and [[Édouard Blau]]. He played a piano version to a select audience that included the Opéra's principal baritone [[Jean-Baptiste Faure]], hoping that the singer's approval might influence the directors of the Opéra to stage the work.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the night of 28–29 October, the Opéra burned to the ground; the directors, amid other pressing concerns, set ''Don Rodrigue'' aside.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 352–53&lt;/ref&gt; It was never completed; Bizet later adapted a theme from its final act as the basis of his 1875 overture, ''Patrie''.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt;

====''Carmen''====
{{main|Carmen}}
[[File:VariousCarmens.jpg|thumb|upright|Various singers depicted in the role of Carmen. Galli-Marie is second from left, middle group]]
[[Adolphe de Leuven]], the co-director of the Opéra-Comique most bitterly opposed to the ''[[Carmen]]'' project, resigned early in 1874, removing the main barrier to the work's production.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt; Bizet finished the score during the summer and was pleased with the outcome: "I have written a work that is all clarity and vivacity, full of colour and melody".&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The renowned mezzo-soprano [[Célestine Galli-Marié]] (known professionally as "Galli-Marié") was engaged to sing the title role. According to Dean, she was as delighted by the part as Bizet was by her suitability for it. There were rumours that he and the singer pursued a brief affair; his relations with Geneviève were strained at this time, and they lived apart for several months.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 110–11&lt;/ref&gt;

When rehearsals began in October 1874, the orchestra had difficulties with the score, finding some parts unplayable.&lt;ref name= D758&gt;Dean (1980), pp. 758–60&lt;/ref&gt; The chorus likewise declared some of their music impossible to sing and were dismayed that they had to act as individuals, smoking and fighting onstage rather than merely standing in line.&lt;ref&gt;McClary, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Bizet also had to counter further attempts at the Opéra-Comique to modify parts of the action which they deemed improper. Only when the leading singers threatened to withdraw from the production did the management give way.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 112–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McClary, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Resolving these issues delayed the first night until 3 March 1875 on which morning, by chance, Bizet's appointment as a Chevalier of the [[Legion of Honour]] was announced.&lt;ref name= C387/&gt;

Among leading musical figures at the premiere were [[Jules Massenet]], [[Camille Saint-Saëns]], and Charles Gounod. Geneviève, suffering from an abscess in her right eye, was unable to be present.&lt;ref name= C387&gt;Curtiss, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; The opera's first performance extended to four-and-a-half hours; the final act did not begin until after midnight.&lt;ref name= S604&gt;Sheen, pp. 604–05&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Massenet and Saint-Saëns were congratulatory, Gounod less so. According to one account, he accused Bizet of plagiarism: "Georges has robbed me! Take the Spanish airs and mine out of the score and there remains nothing to Bizet's credit but the sauce that masks the fish".&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, p. 391&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The acknowledged Spanish melodies are the Habanera, which uses a popular tune by [[Sebastián Iradier]], and the entr'acte to Act 4 which is based on an aria from [[Manuel García (tenor)|Manuel Garcia]]'s opera ''El criado fingido''.&lt;ref&gt;McClary, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Locke&gt;Locke, pp. 318–19&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Much of the press comment was negative, expressing consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather than a woman of virtue.&lt;ref name= S604/&gt; Galli-Marié's performance was described by one critic as "the very incarnation of vice".&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Others complained of a lack of melody and made unfavourable comparisons with the traditional Opéra-Comique fare of [[Daniel Auber|Auber]] and [[François-Adrien Boieldieu|Boieldieu]]. Léon Escudier in ''L'Art Musical'' called the music "dull and obscure&amp;nbsp;... the ear grows weary of waiting for the cadence that never comes".&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; There was, however, praise from the poet [[Théodore de Banville]], who applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with real men and women instead of the usual Opéra-Comique "puppets".&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 408–09&lt;/ref&gt; The public's reaction was lukewarm, and Bizet soon became convinced of its failure: "I foresee a definite and hopeless flop".&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illness and death===
 [[File:Trinity Church Paris France.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, where Bizet's funeral service was held on 5 June 1875]]
For most of his life, Bizet had suffered from a recurrent throat complaint.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; A heavy smoker, he may have further undermined his health by overwork during the mid-1860s, when he toiled over publishers' transcriptions for up to 16 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;Steen, p. 588&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868, he informed Galabert that he had been very ill with abscesses in the windpipe: "I suffered like a dog".&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, and again in 1874, while completing ''Carmen'', he had been disabled by severe bouts of what he described as "throat angina", and suffered a further attack in late March 1875.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 310 and 367&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, depressed by the evident failure of ''Carmen'', Bizet was slow to recover and fell ill again in May. At the end of the month, he went to his holiday home at [[Bougival]] and, feeling a little better, went for a swim in the [[River Seine|Seine]]. On the next day, 1 June, he was afflicted by high fever and pain, which was followed by an apparent heart attack. He seemed temporarily to recover, but in the early hours of 3 June, his wedding anniversary, he suffered a fatal second attack.&lt;ref name= D124&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 124–26&lt;/ref&gt; He was 36 years old.

The suddenness of Bizet's death, and awareness of his depressed mental state, fuelled rumours of suicide. Although the exact cause of death was never settled with certainty, physicians discounted such theories and eventually determined the cause as "a cardiac complication of acute articular rheumatism".{{refn|This opinion was recorded by a physician, Eugène Gelma of the [[University of Strasbourg]], many years after Bizet's death.&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, p. 419&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} News of the death stunned Paris's musical world; as Galli-Marié was too upset to appear, that evening's performance of ''Carmen'' was cancelled and replaced with [[François-Adrien Boieldieu|Boieldieu]]'s ''[[La dame blanche]]''.&lt;ref name= D124/&gt;

At the funeral on 5 June at the [[Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris|Église de la Sainte-Trinité]] in [[Montmartre]], more than 4,000 people were present. Adolphe Bizet led the mourners, who included Gounod, Thomas, Ludovic Halévy, Léon Halévy, and Massenet. An orchestra under Pasdeloup played ''Patrie'', and the organist improvised a fantasy on themes from ''Carmen''. At the burial which followed at the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]], Gounod gave the eulogy. He said that Bizet had been struck down just as he was becoming recognised as a true artist. Towards the end of his address, Gounod broke down and was unable to deliver his final [[peroration]].&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 422–23&lt;/ref&gt; After a special performance of ''Carmen'' at the Opéra-Comique that night, the press which had almost universally condemned the piece three months earlier now declared Bizet a master.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{further|List of compositions by Georges Bizet}}

===Early works===
Bizet's earliest compositions, chiefly songs and keyboard pieces written as exercises, give early indications of his emergent power and his gifts as a melodist.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt; Dean sees evidence in the piano work ''Romance sans parole'', written before 1854, of "the conjunction of melody, rhythm and accompaniment" that is characteristic of Bizet's mature works.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980), p. 749&lt;/ref&gt; Bizet's first orchestral piece was an overture written in 1855 in the manner of Rossini's ''[[William Tell (opera)|Guillaume Tell]]''. Critics have found it unremarkable, but the [[Symphony in C (Bizet)|Symphony in C]] of the same year has been warmly praised by later commentators who have made favourable comparisons with Mozart and Schubert.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt; In Dean's view, the symphony has "few rivals and perhaps no superior in the work of any composer of such youth".&lt;ref name= D750&gt;Dean (1980), pp. 750–51&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Ernest Newman]] suggests that Bizet may at this time have thought that his future lay in the field of instrumental music, before an "inner voice" (and the realities of the French musical world) turned him towards the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, pp. 426–27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orchestral, piano and vocal works===

After his early Symphony in C, Bizet's purely orchestral output is sparse. The ''Roma'' symphony over which he laboured for more than eight years compares poorly, in Dean's view, with its juvenile predecessor. The work, says Dean, owes something to Gounod and contains passages that recall [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]. However, Dean contends that the work suffers from poor organisation and an excess of pretentious music; he calls it a "misfire". Bizet's other mature orchestral work, the overture ''Patrie'', is similarly dismissed: "an awful warning of the danger of confusing art with patriotism".&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 141–45&lt;/ref&gt; The musicologist [[Hugh Macdonald]] argues that Bizet's best orchestral music is found in the suites that he derived respectively from the piano work ''Jeux d'enfants'' and the incidental music for ''L'Arlésienne''. In these, he demonstrates a maturity of style that, had he lived longer, might have been the basis for future great orchestral works.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt;

Bizet's piano works have not entered the concert pianist's repertoire, and are generally too difficult for amateurs to attempt. An exception is the set of 12 pieces evoking the world of children's games, ''Jeux d'enfants'', written for four hands. Here, Bizet avoided the virtuoso passages which tend to dominate his solo works.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt; The earlier solo pieces bear the influence of Chopin; later works, such as the ''Variations Chromatiques'' and the ''Chasse Fantastique'', owe more to Liszt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Ashley|first= Tim|title= Bizet: Complete Music for Solo Piano&amp;nbsp;– review|url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/mar/10/bizet-solo-piano-review|journal= The Guardian|date= 10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of Bizet's songs were written in the period 1866–68. Dean defines the main weaknesses in these songs as an unimaginative repetition of the same music for each verse, and a tendency to write for the orchestra rather than the voice.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Bizet's larger-scale vocal music is lost; the early ''Te Deum'', which survives in full, is rejected by Dean as "a wretched work [that] merely illustrates Bizet's unfitness to write religious music."&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dramatic works===
[[File:Carmen at the Met1915.jpg|thumb|Publicity shots for the ''Carmen'' revival at the Metropolitan Opera, New York, in January 1915, with [[Enrico Caruso]] and [[Geraldine Farrar]]. Caruso is centre in the upper row, Farrar top left and bottom right.]]
Bizet's early one-act opera ''Le docteur Miracle'' provides the first clear signs of his promise in this genre, its sparkling music including, according to Dean, "many happy touches of parody, scoring and comic characterisation".&lt;ref name= D750/&gt; Newman perceives evidence of Bizet's later achievements in many of his earliest works: "[A]gain and again we light upon some touch or other in them that only a musician with a dramatic root of the matter in him could have achieved."&lt;ref&gt;Newman, p. 428&lt;/ref&gt; Until ''Carmen'', however, Bizet was not essentially an innovator in the musical theatre. He wrote most of his operas in the traditions of Italian and French opera established by such as [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], Rossini, Berlioz, Gounod, and Thomas. Macdonald suggests that, technically, he surpassed all of these, with a feeling for the human voice that compares with that of Mozart.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt;

In ''Don Procopio'', Bizet followed the stock devices of Italian opera as typified by Donizetti in ''[[Don Pasquale]]'', a work which it closely resembles. However, the familiar idiom is interspersed with original touches in which Bizet's fingerprints emerge unmistakably.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980), p. 752&lt;/ref&gt; In his first significant opera, ''Les pêcheurs de perles'', Bizet was hampered by a dull libretto and a laborious plot; nevertheless, the music in Dean's view rises at times "far above the level of contemporary French opera".&lt;ref name= D754/&gt; Its many original flourishes include the introduction to the [[cavatina]]'' Comme autrefois dans la nuit sombre'' played by two [[French horns]] over a cello background, an effect which in the words of analyst [[Hervé Lacombe]], "resonates in the memory like a fanfare lost in a distant forest".&lt;ref&gt;Lacombe, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; While the music of ''Les pêcheurs'' is atmospheric and deeply evocative of the opera's Eastern setting, in ''La jolie fille de Perth'', Bizet made no attempt to introduce Scottish colour or mood,&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt; though the scoring includes highly imaginative touches such as a separate band of woodwind and strings during the opera's Act III seduction scene.&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 184–85&lt;/ref&gt;

From Bizet's unfinished works, Macdonald highlights ''La coupe du roi de Thulé'' as giving clear signs of the power that would reach a pinnacle in ''Carmen'' and suggests that had ''Clarissa Harlowe'' and ''Grisélidis'' been completed, Bizet's legacy would have been "infinitely richer".&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt; As Bizet moved away from the accepted musical conventions of French opera, he encountered critical hostility. In the case of ''Djamileh'', the accusation of "Wagnerism" was raised again,&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; as audiences struggled to understand the score's originality; many found the music pretentious and monotonous, lacking in both rhythm and melody.&lt;ref name= D758/&gt; By contrast, modern critical opinion as expressed by Macdonald is that ''Djamileh'' is "a truly enchanting piece, full of inventive touches, especially of chromatic colour."&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt;

Ralph P. Locke, in his study of ''Carmen's'' origins, draws attention to Bizet's successful evocation of Andalusian Spain.&lt;ref name= Locke/&gt; Grout, in his ''History of Western Music'', praises the music's extraordinary rhythmic and melodic vitality, and Bizet's ability to obtain the maximum dramatic effect in the most economical fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Grout and Palisca, p. 615&lt;/ref&gt; Among the opera's early champions were [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], and particularly Wagner, who commented: "Here, thank God, at last for a change is somebody with ideas in his head."&lt;ref name= Schon36&gt;Schonberg (Vol. II), pp. 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; Another champion of the work was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who claimed to know it by heart; "It is music that makes no pretensions to depth, but it is delightful in its simplicity, so unaffected and sincere".&lt;ref name= Schon&gt;Schonberg (Vol. II), pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt; By broad consent, ''Carmen'' represents the fulfilment of Bizet's development as a master of music drama and the culmination of the genre of [[opéra comique]].&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt;&lt;ref name= D760&gt;Dean (1980), pp. 760–61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
After Bizet's death, many of his manuscripts were lost; works were revised by other hands and published in these unauthorised versions so that it is often difficult to establish what is authentic Bizet.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt; Even ''Carmen'' was altered into [[grand opera]] format by the replacement of its dialogue with recitatives written by Guiraud, and by other amendments to the score.&lt;ref name= D760/&gt; The music world did not immediately acknowledge Bizet as a master and, apart from ''Carmen'' and the ''L'Arlésienne'' suite, few of his works were performed in the years immediately following his death.&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt; However, the 20th century saw an increase of interest. ''Don Procopio'' was revived in [[Monte Carlo]] in 1906;&lt;ref name = WW/&gt; an Italian version of ''Les pêcheurs de perles'' was performed at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York on 13 November 1916, with [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] in the leading tenor role,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Les pêcheurs de perles: Metropolitan Opera House: 11/13/1916|url= http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/frame.htm |publisher= Metropolitan Opera House, New York|accessdate= 11 October 2011}} (Use Key word Search)&lt;/ref&gt; and it has since become a staple at many opera houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Macdonald|first= Hugh|url= http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/O903766?q=Les+pecheurs+de+perles&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|title= Pêcheurs de perles, Les |publisher= Oxford Music Online|accessdate= 11 October 2011}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its first performance in Switzerland in 1935, the Symphony in C entered the concert repertory and has been recorded by, among many others, [[Sir Thomas Beecham]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts (ed.), pp. 171–72&lt;/ref&gt; Excerpts from ''La coupe du roi de Thulé'', edited by Winton Dean, were broadcast by the [[BBC]] on 12 July 1955,&lt;ref&gt;Dean (1980), p. 762&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Le docteur Miracle'' was revived in London on 8 December 1957 by the Park Lane Group.&lt;ref name = WW&gt;Warrack and West, pp. 195 and 201&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Vasco da Gama'' and ''Ivan IV'' have been recorded, as have numerous songs and the complete piano music.{{refn|Numerous recordings of these works are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Bizet: Vasco da Gama: Ouvre ton coeur|url= http://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/w/68754/Georges-Bizet-Vasco-da-Gama-Ouvre-ton-coeur|publisher= Presto Classical|accessdate= 11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Bizet – Ivan IV Live |url= https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bizet-Ivan-IV-Inva-Mula/dp/B00006BHE9 |publisher= Amazon |accessdate= 21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Bizet: Complete Piano Music|url= http://www.prestoclassical.co.uk/r/Naxos/8570831-32|publisher= Presto Classical|accessdate= 11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} ''Carmen'', after its lukewarm initial Paris run of 45 performances, became a worldwide popular success after performances in Vienna (1875) and London (1878).&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 426–29&lt;/ref&gt; It has been hailed as the first opera of the [[verismo]] school, in which sordid and brutal subjects are emphasised, with art reflecting life—"not idealised life but life as actually lived".&lt;ref name= Schon36/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dent, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;

The music critic [[Harold Schonberg]] surmises that had Bizet lived, he might have revolutionised French opera;&lt;ref name= Schon/&gt; as it is, verismo was taken up mainly by Italians, notably [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]] who, according to Dean, developed the idea "till it became threadbare".&lt;ref name= D244&gt;Dean (1965), pp. 244–46&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In his 1958 biography of Puccini, [[Edward Greenfield]] calls the association of Puccini with verismo "misleading", stating that he chose his subjects on pragmatic principles of maximum audience appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Bizet founded no specific school, though Dean names [[Emmanuel Chabrier|Chabrier]] and [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]] as composers influenced by him. Dean also suggests that a fascination with Bizet's tragic heroes—Frédéri in ''L'Arlésienne'', José in ''Carmen''—is reflected in Tchaikovsky's late symphonies, particularly the [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|B minor "''Pathetique''"]].&lt;ref name= D244/&gt; Macdonald writes that Bizet's legacy is limited by the shortness of his life and by the false starts and lack of focus that persisted until his final five years. "The spectacle of great works unwritten either because Bizet had other distractions, or because no one asked him to write them, or because of his premature death, is infinitely dispiriting, yet the brilliance and the individuality of his best music is unmistakable. It has greatly enriched a period of French music already rich in composers of talent and distinction."&lt;ref name= OMO/&gt;

In Bizet's family circle, his father Adolphe died in 1886. Bizet's son Jacques committed suicide in 1922 after an unhappy love affair. Jean Reiter, Bizet's elder son, had a successful career as press director of ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'', became an Officer of the Legion of Honour, and died in 1939 at the age of 77. In 1886, Geneviève married Émile Straus, a rich lawyer; she became a famous Parisian society hostess and a close friend of, among others, [[Marcel Proust]]. She showed little interest in her first husband's musical legacy, made no effort to catalogue Bizet's manuscripts and gave many away as souvenirs. She died in 1926; in her will, she established a fund for a Georges Bizet prize, to be awarded annually to a composer under 40 who had "produced a remarkable work within the previous five years". Winners of the prize include [[Tony Aubin]], [[Jean-Michel Damase]], [[Henri Dutilleux]], and [[Jean Martinon]].&lt;ref&gt;Steen, pp. 605–06&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Curtiss, pp. 438–41&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gracilidris''''' is a [[genus]] of [[Dolichoderinae|dolichoderine]] [[ant]]s with nocturnal behaviour; thought to have gone extinct 15-20 million years ago, they have been found in [[Paraguay]], [[Brazil]], and [[Argentina]] and were described in 2006.&lt;ref name=Wild&gt;Wild, A. L. and F. Cuezzo. 2006. Rediscovery of a fossil Dolichoderine ant lineage (Hymenoptera: Formicidae: Dolichoderinae) and a description of a new genus from South America. ''Zootaxa'' '''1142''': 57-68. ISSN: [http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/ 1175-5334] '''[http://www.antwiki.org/wiki/images/c/c2/Wild_%26_Cuezzo_2006.pdf PDF]'''&lt;/ref&gt;

The single existing fossil in [[Dominican amber]] makes the genus a [[Lazarus taxon]]. The only known extant species, ''[[Gracilidris pombero]]'', nests in small [[ant colony|colonies]] in the soil. These ants have been described only very recently and little is known about them.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

'''HMCS ''Integrity''''' was a [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] built by the Colonial Government of [[New South Wales]] in 1804. She was the first vessel ever [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] from a New South Wales [[dockyard]] and carried goods between the colony's coastal settlements of [[Norfolk Island]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales]], [[Van Diemen's Land]] and [[Port Jackson]]. In 1804 she took part in a series of voyages to Van Diemen's Land with the aim of founding a colony at Port Dalrymple, the site of the modern settlement of [[George Town, Tasmania]].

In 1805 ''Integrity'' encountered and recaptured a Spanish [[brig]] which had been unlawfully seized by privateers and concealed in the [[Kent Group]] of islands in [[Bass Strait]]. Having returned the Spanish vessel to colonial control, ''Integrity'' was designated the task of sailing to [[Chile]] to negotiate its return to Spain. She set sail for [[Valparaíso]], Chile, in June 1805, but was not seen again and is likely to have foundered during the voyage.

==Construction==
[[File:Sydney Cove, Port Jackson in the County of Cumberland - F. F. delineavit, 1769.jpg|thumb|left|Port Jackson, where ''Integrity'' was constructed and launched from a dockyard (unmarked) on the shore of the cove.]]
''Integrity'' was laid down in September 1802 at the newly opened [[H.M. Dockyard (Sydney)|King's Dockyard]] in the colony of New South Wales. Governor [[Philip Gidley King]] ordered that construction proceed as swiftly as possible, in order to test the Dockyard's capacity. A team of two shipwrights, two apprentice shipwrights and two sawyers were assigned the task and delivered the finished cutter in thirteen months.&lt;ref name=Bladen338/&gt; During construction shipwright [[Thomas Moore (Australian settler)|Thomas Moore]] tested that the hull was watertight by filling it with water from the inside, and repairing any visible leaks.&lt;ref name=hawkins&gt;{{cite journal | last =Hawkins | first =Clifford W. | title =The Passage of Sail: European Sailing Ship Building in the South West Pacific | journal = The Great Circle | volume =5 | issue =2 | page =88 | publisher =Australian Association of Maritime History | date =October 1983 | jstor =41562665 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her hold also incorporated a partition that her crew could move to or away from the [[forecastle]] [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] to vary her cargo capacity.&lt;ref name=hawkins/&gt;

Governor King's direction had been for a vessel measuring around 46 [[Builder's Old Measurement|tons burthen]],&lt;ref&gt;Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 4, p. 901.&lt;/ref&gt; but the final vessel was significantly larger at 59 {{fraction|3|4}} tons.&lt;ref name=Bladen338/&gt; King was impressed with the work despite this variation from the original plans; in a letter to [[Robert Hobart, 4th Earl of Buckinghamshire|Lord Hobart]], [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]], he praised the speed and quality of ''Integrity''{{'}}s construction and described her as "extremely well put together and strong".&lt;ref&gt;Governor King to Lord Hobart, 1 March 1804. Cited in Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, pp. 328–338.&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly built vessel was launched on 13 January 1804 as "His Majesty's Armed Colonial Cutter ''Integrity''" under the command of [[Royal Navy]] [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] John Houstoun and with a crew of eight men.&lt;ref&gt;Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first seagoing vessel to be launched in the colony of [[New South Wales]], all previous craft having been small enough to be floated off the shore.&lt;ref name=hawkins/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article625978 |title=Postscript |newspaper=The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser, Sunday 15 January 1804|page=4 |location= |accessdate=19 January 2016 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout her active service she remained under the direct control of the colonial government of New South Wales, and was never formally commissioned into the Royal Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon 1993, pp. 284, 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Active service==

===Early voyages===
[[File:Philip Gidley King - Project Gutenberg eText 12992.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Colonial Governor Philip Gidley King, under whose authority ''Integrity''{{'}}s voyages took place.]]
''Integrity''{{'}}s first voyage was in February 1804, heading south along the eastern coastline of Australia to transport settlers and supplies across Bass Strait to the colonial outpost in [[Van Diemen's Land]].&lt;ref name=Bladen338/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article626021 |title=Ship News |newspaper=The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser|location=NSW |date=5 February 1804 |accessdate=20 February 2016 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Newspaper coverage of the voyage incorrectly listed Lieutenant Bowen as travelling aboard ''Integrity'', a claim contradicted by both King and Bowen himself in correspondence regarding his refusal to board.&lt;ref name=Bladen338/&gt;}} The administrator of that outpost, Lieutenant [[John Bowen (colonist)|John Bowen]], had recently resigned his position and returned to Port Jackson. Governor King now directed that Bowen travel back to Van Diemen's Land aboard ''Integrity'' in order to formalise the transfer of colonial authority to his successor. However Bowen refused to go aboard, and the cutter ultimately sailed without him in order to deliver its supplies. The voyage was a success other than a broken rudder fastener which was repaired when ''Integrity'' reached Van Diemen's Land in early March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article626163 |title=Ship News |newspaper=The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser|location=NSW |date=22 April 1804 |accessdate=20 February 2016 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cutter then completed the round trip back to Port Jackson, arriving safely at her home port on 24 April.&lt;ref&gt;Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, pp. 381–382.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June Governor King issued directions for ''Integrity''{{'}}s second voyage. With Lieutenant Houstoun again in command, the cutter was to transport [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] [[William Paterson (explorer)|William Paterson]] to the north of Van Diemen's Land in order to found a new settlement at Port Dalrymple. To support the settlement, the cutter was also assigned to carry nineteen soldiers of the [[New South Wales Corps]], a ship's surgeon and ten [[convict]]s. A further fifteen soldiers and eleven convicts would accompany the expedition aboard a privately owned vessel, ''Contest.'' Once Paterson had disembarked at Port Dalrymple, ''Integrity'' was to follow the coastline of [[Port Phillip Bay]] so that Houstoun could survey the shore and determine its suitability for future colonisation. The cutter would then proceed to [[Cape Barren Island]], a remote location in Bass Strait, to investigate rumours that a group of American sailors were establishing an unlawful trade in seal skins.&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence, Governor King to Lieutenant-Colonel Paterson, 1 June 1804. Cited in Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, pp. 383–384.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Integrity'' set sail on 8 June, heading south along the New South Wales coast. A week later she encountered heavy storms and winds while passing [[Cape Howe]] and was unable to proceed. Houstoun ordered a return to Port Jackson, which was regained on 19 June.&lt;ref name=Bladen418&gt;Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In a letter to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Governor King incorrectly records ''Integrity''{{'}}s return to Port Jackson as occurring on 21 June.&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence, Governor King to Lord Hobart, 14 August 1804. Cited in Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;}} While in port, one of ''Integrity''{{'}}s crew, a sailor named William Dwyre, was removed from the ship and sent to prison for having refusing to carry out his duties while aboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article626286 |title=Examinations Before the Magistrates |newspaper=The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser |location=NSW |date=1 July 1804 |accessdate=20 February 2016 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no sign of ''Contest'' and she was presumed lost at sea.&lt;ref name=Bladen418/&gt;

The voyage was re-attempted on 3 July, but ''Integrity'' again ran into heavy weather off Cape Howe and was forced to turn towards the shore to seek shelter. The cutter entered what would later be known as [[Twofold Bay]] on the New South Wales South Coast, where to her crew's surprise they discovered ''Contest'', undamaged but unable to return to sea in the storm.&lt;ref name=Bladen385&gt;Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt;

The passengers and crew of both vessels consulted on whether to continue southwards or turn back and await better weather. According to one source, missionary W.P. Crook aboard ''Integrity'', there was unanimity for continuing the voyage except for Captain Houstoun, who wished to turn back.&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence, Missionary W.P. Crook to the London Missionary Society, 1804. Cited in Bladen 1979, vol. 5, pp. 537–538.&lt;/ref&gt; As Houstoun was the nominal commander of the voyage his view prevailed and ''Integrity'' and ''Contest'' returned to Port Jackson together, arriving on 13 July.&lt;ref name=Bladen385/&gt;

===Port Dalrymple flotilla===
''Integrity''{{'}}s repeated failure to reach Port Dalrymple convinced Governor King that larger vessels would be required to make the voyage. The [[East India Company]] was approached to provide either ''[[Coromandel (1793 ship)|Coromandel]]'' or ''[[Experiment (1798 ship)|Experiment]]'', both then in New South Wales waters, but the request was declined.&lt;ref name=Bladen420&gt;Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, pp. 420–421.&lt;/ref&gt; In the interim ''Integrity'' was sent north with provisions for the colonial settlement at Norfolk Island, departing on 20 July 1804 and returning in early August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article626324 |title=Ship News |newspaper=The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser |location=NSW |date=22 July 1804 |accessdate=20 February 2016 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bladen436&gt;Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, p. 436.&lt;/ref&gt; In September she sailed a round trip to the New South Wales colony of Newcastle to ship a cargo of cedar wood back to Port Jackson, followed by another brief voyage to Norfolk Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article626428 |title=Port News |newspaper=The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser |date=30 September 1804 |accessdate=7 February 2016 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article626400 |title=Ship News |newspaper=The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser|location=NSW |date=9 September 1804 |accessdate=20 February 2016 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October Governor King issued orders for a flotilla to attempt the voyage. The expedition would be led by the 12-gun Royal Navy storeship {{HMS|Buffalo|1797|6}} and the 6-gun survey vessel {{HMS|Lady Nelson|1798|6}}.&lt;ref name=Bladen420/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, pp. 473–475.&lt;/ref&gt; They would be accompanied by ''Integrity'', and by the elderly colonial schooner ''[[Francis (1793)|Francis]]'' which had been in service since 1792 and was described by King as  "much damaged" but still seaworthy.&lt;ref name=Bladen436/&gt; Lieutenant-Colonel Paterson and the principal colonists would travel aboard ''Buffalo'' but transfer to ''Integrity'' if the Navy vessel was too large to enter the bay where the settlement was proposed to stand.&lt;ref name=Bladen420/&gt;

The flotilla departed Port Jackson on 15 October, proceeding southward down the New South Wales coastline towards Bass Strait. Cape Howe was passed without incident, though the schooner ''Francis'' struggled with the ocean swell and continually fell behind the larger vessels. The weather slowly worsened until on sunset of 18 October the flotilla encountered a heavy [[gale]]. Captain William Kent of ''Buffalo'' signaled for the flotilla to take in their sails and ride out the storm; on the following morning the crew of ''Integrity'' discovered that they had lost sight of all three other vessels and were running dangerously close to a [[lee shore]]. Houstoun elected to continue southward close to land, preferring the risk of running aground to that of braving the gale in deeper water.&lt;ref name=Kent&gt;Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 5, pp. 488–492.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a glimpse of ''Buffalo'' far to the east on the morning of 21 October, "laboring much and lurching very deep" among the waves.&lt;ref&gt;Captain Kent to Governor King, 28 November 1804. Cited in Bladen 1979, vol. 5, p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt; Other than this sighting ''Integrity'' continued her voyage alone through the storm, crossing Bass Strait into clearer weather on around 23 October. The cutter was brought into an uninhabited bay on the northeast coast of Van Diemen's Land where she underwent basic repairs.&lt;ref name=Kent/&gt;

After ten days she was returned to sea and reached Port Dalrymple on the morning of 5 November. ''Buffalo'' had already arrived, but there was no sign of ''Lady Nelson'' or ''Francis.'' Houstoun's achievement in navigating the storm was recognised through a transfer to ''Buffalo'', a larger and more prestigious vessel than ''Integrity''. His former colonial command was allocated to midshipman [[Charles Robbins (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Robbins]], who was promoted Acting Lieutenant by virtue of his new role.&lt;ref name=Kent/&gt; The remaining vessels in the flotilla, ''Lady Nelson'' and ''Francis'', arrived in Port Dalrymple on 21 November. ''Integrity'' departed a week later, Robbins having been ordered to explore the far western coastline of Van Diemen's Land.&lt;ref name=Kent/&gt;

===Capture of ''Saint Francisco &amp; Saint Paulo''===
In April 1805 ''Integrity'' encountered the brig ''Saint Francisco &amp; Saint Paulo'' off the Kent Group of islands in Bass Strait.&lt;ref name=Francisco&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article626771 |title=SHIP NEWS. |newspaper=The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser |location=NSW |date=19 May 1805 |accessdate=20 February 2016 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brig and another ship, ''[[Estramina|Extremeña]]'', had been seized from the Chilean ports of [[Caldera, Chile|Caldera]] and [[Coquimbo]] in September 1804 by Captain William Campbell of the [[privateer]] [[Harrington (1800 ship)|''Harrington'']].&lt;ref name=Gazette&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page6140 |title=Ship News |newspaper=[[The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser]] |location=Sydney NSW |date=30 June 1805 |accessdate=14 January 2016 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish ships had then been sailed to Port Jackson while Governor King considered whether to return them to Chile.&lt;ref name=Rusden&gt;Rusden 1883, pp. 410–411.&lt;/ref&gt; Unwilling to await King's decision, Captain Campbell had ordered his crew to put to sea in ''Saint Francisco &amp; Saint Paulo'' and conceal the vessel in an uninhabited location. Departing south from Port Jackson in early March, the brig ran into rough weather in Bass Strait and began to sink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article626771 |title=Ship News |newspaper=The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser |location=NSW |date=19 May 1805 |accessdate=20 February 2016 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; When approached by ''Integrity'', the Spanish ship was shipping {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} of water over the lowest deck inside the hull. ''Integrity''{{'}}s crew assisted in keeping the brig afloat and she was safely conveyed to Port Dalrymple, arriving on 17 May 1805.&lt;ref name=Francisco/&gt;

==Fate==
In June 1805 Governor King received legal advice from the British Government indicating that colonial retention of the Spanish vessels ''Extremeña'' and ''St Francisco &amp; St Paulo'' could give rise to a charge of piracy.&lt;ref name=Bladen112&gt;Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 6, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; In these circumstances, King directed that ''Integrity'' should sail to Chile to offer the safe return of the Spanish ships. The cutter departed for Valparaíso, Chile on 20 June 1805.&lt;ref name=Bladen112/&gt; For the voyage she was again under the command of Acting Lieutenant Robbins, with a crew of ten men and bearing a [[White flag|flag of truce]] "in case war should have taken place between England and Spain" before she reached her destination.&lt;ref name=Gazette/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rusden/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bateson 1972, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; She was not seen again. Historian Frank Bladen has conjectured that the cutter either foundered ''en route'', or reached South America but was captured by an indigenous tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 6, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after ''Integrity''{{'}}s departure, on 20 July 1806, King wrote to [[Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh|Viscount Castlereagh]] expressing concern at the cutter's continued absence and hoping that she had simply been detained by Spanish authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence, Governor King to Viscount Castlereagh, 20 July 1806. Cited in Bladen 1979, vol. 6, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; She was last mentioned in a report on colonial shipping compiled by Governor King in August 1806&amp;nbsp;– fourteen months after her disappearance – with details of pay still owing to her crew and accompanied by the annotation "Gone to Valparaiso ... Not returned."&lt;ref name=Bladen127&gt;Bladen (ed.) 1979, vol. 6, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|In this report, King incorrectly records that ''Integrity'' set sail for Chile on 26 June 1805 instead of 20 June.&lt;ref name=Bladen127/&gt;}}

'''Hikmet Bilâ''' ({{IPA-tr|hicˈmet ˈbilaː|pron}}; 1954 – 21 October 2011) was a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[journalist]] and [[columnist]]. He was the author of three books about Turkish political history.

== Biography ==
He was born in [[Zonguldak]] in 1954. After graduating from high school, he was admitted to [[Ankara University, Faculty of Political Sciences]] and earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree from international relations department.&lt;ref name="HDN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=journalist-hikmet-bila-passes-away-2011-10-21 |newspaper=Hürriyet Daily News |title=Journalist Hikmet Bila passes away |date= 2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hikmet Bilâ started his journalism career in daily newspaper ''[[Yeni Ulus]]'' in 1973. He wrote columns in several Turkish newspapers including ''[[Milliyet]]'', ''[[Cumhuriyet]]'', and ''[[Vatan]]''. He worked as [[editor-in-chief]] at leading news channel of Turkey, [[NTV (Turkey)|NTV]].&lt;ref name="funeral"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/?im=yhs&amp;hn=287508 |newspaper=Cumhuriyet |title=Hikmet Bila son yolculuğuna uğurlandı |language=Turkish |date=2011-10-22 |accessdate=2011-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401212435/http://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/?im=yhs&amp;hn=287508 |archivedate=2012-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Huna''' is a [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word adopted by [[Max Freedom Long]] (1890–1971) in 1936 to describe his theory of [[metaphysics]]. Long cited what he believed to be the spiritual practices of ancient [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] [[kahuna]]s (priests) as inspiration; however, the system is his invention, with roots in [[New Thought]] and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], rather than in traditional Hawaiian beliefs. Huna is part of the [[New Age]] movement.

==History==
Max Freedom Long, who was not [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]], went to Hawaii in 1917 to work as an elementary school teacher. He became interested in the religious beliefs and practices of the ancient [[kahuna]]s and modern practitioners of traditional, indigenous Hawaiian religion, but none of the ceremonial people talked to him so he was unable to penetrate to the inner workings of this religion. He left Hawaii in 1931, convinced that he would never learn these secrets. In 1934, he woke with a revelation that the secrets were encoded into the Hawaiian language itself. He called the religious system he developed from this revelation 'Huna' (the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word for secret), and wrote his first book in 1936 to chronicle his beliefs. There are no accepted Hawaiian sources that refer to the word 'Huna' as a tradition of esoteric learning.&lt;ref name=Malo&gt;Malo, David. ''Hawaiian Antiquities'' (Bishop Museum, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kamakua1&gt;Kamakua, Samuel. ''The People of Old'' (Bishop Museum, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='I'&gt;'I'i, John Papa. ''Fragments of Hawaiian History'' (Bishop Museum, 1959)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beckwith&gt;Beckwith, Martha. ''Kepelino's Traditions of Hawaii'' (Bishop Museum, 1932)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945 Long founded Huna Research. In 1953, he published ''The Secret Science at Work'' as a Huna textbook, and in 1965 ''The Huna Codes in Religions'', examining parallels between his invented system and religions such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name = lewis/&gt;

==Principles and beliefs==
The [[New Age]] practice of Huna emphasizes practical living and harmony with three levels of consciousness or selves. Long claimed that a low, middle, and higher self were recognized by the ancient kahunas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology| editor=Melton, J. Gordon| editor-link=J. Gordon Melton| volume = 1 |edition=5|year=2001|publisher=Gale Research |chapter= Huna|isbn=0-8103-9489-8|page=755}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Long called these selves the ''unihipili'' (subconscious, inner, emotional, intuitive), ''uhane'' (waking consciousness, rational) and ''aumakua'' (super-conscious, connection with the divine),&lt;ref&gt;Long (1954) pp. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; however these are not the  Hawaiian meanings of these words.&lt;ref name="Lee 1999 56"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Lee| first = Pali Jae| authorlink = | title = Ho`opono| publisher = Night Rainbow Publishing| year = 1999| location = Honolulu | pages = 56| url = | doi = | oclc=44516946}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee2007&gt;{{cite book  | last = Lee| first = Pali Jae| authorlink = | title = Ho`opono - Revised Edition: The Hawaiian Way to Put Things Back in Balance| publisher = IM Publishing| year = 2007| location = Mountain View, HI|edition=2nd| pages = 89–93| url = | doi = | isbn =978-0-9677253-7-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pukui&gt;{{cite book | last = Pukui | first = Mary Kawena |author2=Samuel H. Elbert| title = Hawaiian Dictionary | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | location = Honolulu | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-8248-0703-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long also redefined the Hawaiian concept of ''[[mana]]'', (privileged as a divine power in traditional Hawaiian belief), and presented it instead as a vitalizing life force, which can, with knowledge of the three selves, be used in a manner of "personal empowerment" to heal body and mind and achieve life goals.&lt;ref name = lewis/&gt; 

Long believed he had discovered an ancient Truth, not just about Hawaiian spirituality but linking back to India and ancient Egypt. He believed Hawaiians were a lost tribe of Berbers. He wrote that spiritual adepts migrated to Hawai‘i from Egypt, passing on to the priests of India some of their basic beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Long (1954) pp125-126&lt;/ref&gt;

Long linked Huna to [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and [[New Thought]] movements of the time. He wrote that the [[Christian Scientists]] understood positive thinking better than any group he knew,&lt;ref&gt;Long (1954) p364&lt;/ref&gt; and encouraged his readers to subscribe to [[Unity Church]]’s magazine, ''Daily Word''.&lt;ref&gt;Long (1954) p366&lt;/ref&gt; Later Huna teachers have placed it firmly in the [[New Age]], with Serge King claiming that Huna came originally from [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] from the [[Pleiades]] who were remnants of the mythical advanced civilizations of [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]] or [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]],&lt;ref name="King1985"&gt;{{cite book |title=Kahuna Healing |last=King |first=Serge Kahili |authorlink= |year=1985 |publisher=[[Theosophical Society]] |location= |isbn=0-8356-0572-8 |page= |pages= 10–11|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pila Chiles associating the islands with the New Age versions/interpretations of [[chakras]], [[vortexes]] and [[ley line]]s.&lt;ref name="Pila"&gt;{{cite book |title=Secrets and Mysteries of Hawaii |last=Chiles|first=Pila |authorlink= |year=1995 |publisher=[[Health Communications]] |location= |isbn=1-55874-362-6 |page=  |pages= 51, 71|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to critics, Serge King [[Cultural appropriation|misappropriated]] and attempted to redefine&lt;ref name=Rothstein&gt;Rothstein, Mikael, in Lewis, James R. and Daren Kemp. ''Handbook of New Age''. Brill Academic Publishers, 2007 {{ISBN|978-90-04-15355-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chai102&gt;Chai, Makana Risser. "Huna, Max Freedom Long, and the Idealization of William Brigham," ''The Hawaiian Journal of History,'' Vol. 45 (2011) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; three [[Hawaiian language]] words for his idea of "the three selves": "[[Kū|Ku]]," "[[Lono]]," and "[[Kāne|Kane]]."&lt;ref name="King1990"&gt;{{cite book |title=Urban Shaman |last=King |first=Serge Kahili |authorlink= |year=1990 |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location= |isbn=0-671-68307-1 |page= |pages= 52–81|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the meanings he gives these words are not the meanings of the words in Hawaiian.&lt;ref name=Pukui/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rothstein/&gt; King wrote that the seven principles of Huna are:

#''IKE'' (ee-kay) - The world is what you think it is.
#''KALA'' - There are no limits.
#''MAKIA'' (mah-kee-ah) - Energy flows where attention goes.
#''MANAWA'' (man-ah-wah) - Now is the moment of power.
#''ALOHA'' - To love is to be happy with (someone or something).
#''MANA'' - All power comes from within.
#''PONO'' - Effectiveness is the measure of truth.&lt;ref name="King1990"/&gt;

Native speakers, scholars and dictionaries concur that the meanings King gives for these words do not reflect their usage in the Hawaiian language, nor any traditional Hawaiian beliefs.&lt;ref name=Pukui/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rothstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chai102/&gt; King also calls what he does "[[Neoshamanism|shamanism]]" and cites "West African shamanism" as an influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huna.net/Media/skbio.htm Serge King's Biodata], Aloha International&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
Max Freedom Long wrote that he obtained many of his case studies and his ideas about what to look for in kahuna magic from the Director of the [[Bishop Museum]] in Honolulu, [[William Brigham]]. According to an article in the peer-reviewed ''Hawaiian Journal of History,'' there is no credible evidence that the two men met. Even if they did, Brigham was not an expert on kahunas and did not document in his own writings any of the incidents Long ascribed to him, including walking on hot lava. In his letters and manuscripts, Brigham stated that Hawaiians were "an inferior race," and implied they were lazy. He referred to [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili'uokalani]] as a "she devil," "[[squaw]]," and "[[nigger]]."&lt;ref name=Chai&gt;Chai, Makana Risser. "Huna, Max Freedom Long, and the Idealization of William Brigham," ''The Hawaiian Journal of History,'' Vol. 45 (2011) pp. 101-121&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Native Hawaiians|Native Hawaiian]] scholar Charles Kenn, a [[Living Treasure of Hawai'i]], recognized in the Hawaiian community as a ''kahuna'' and expert in Hawaiian history and traditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Stone| first = Scott S.C.| authorlink = | title = ''Living Treasures of Hawaii 25th Anniversary of the Selections of Outstanding Persons as Honored by The Honpa Honwanji Mission of Hawai'i'' | publisher = Island Heritage| year = 2000| location = Honolulu| pages = 24| url = | doi = | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; was friendly with Max Freedom Long but said, “While this Huna study is an interesting study, … it is not, and never was Hawaiian.”&lt;ref name="Lee 1999 56"/&gt;

Pali Jae Lee, a research librarian at the Bishop Museum, and author of the classic book, ''Tales From the Night Rainbow'', conducted extensive research on Max Freedom Long and Huna. She concluded, based on her interviews with Hawaiian elders, "Huna is not Hawaiian." Lee cites Theodore Kelsey, a [[Living Treasure of Hawai'i]] renowned for his work as a Hawaiian translator who wrote a letter to Long in 1936 (now in the Hawai'i State Archives) criticizing his use of the terms "unihipili" and "aumakua."&lt;ref name="Lee 1999 56"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lee2007/&gt;

Author Nancy Kahalewai, a teacher of lomilomi massage, wrote that "traditional lomilomi practitioners do not teach this philosophy. In fact, most insist that it is not from the native Hawaiian culture at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Kahalewai| first = Nancy| authorlink = | title = ''Hawaiian Lomilomi: Big Island Massage'' Second Edition| publisher = IM Publishing| year = 2004| location = Mountain View, HI| pages = 139| url = | doi = | isbn =978-0-9677253-2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells College Professor Lisa Kahaleole Hall, Ph.D., a Native Hawaiian, wrote in a peer-reviewed journal published by the University of Hawai'i that Huna "bears absolutely no resemblance to any Hawaiian worldview or spiritual practice" and calls it part of the "New Age spiritual industry."&lt;ref name=Kahaleole&gt;Hall, Lisa Kahaleole. "[http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/13881/v17n2-404-413-dialogue2.pdf?sequence=1 'Hawaiian at Heart' and Other Fictions]," The Contemporary Pacific, Volume 17, Number 2, 404-413, © 2005 by University of Hawai'i Press
&lt;/ref&gt;

Mikael Rothstein, an associate professor of religious history at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, is the author of several books on religious history and new religious movements. He wrote about Huna in a peer-reviewed anthology:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Rather than integrating Hawaiian religion, however, New Agers seem to carry out a radical reinterpretation of this tradition, or simply invent traditions that were never Hawaiian. … New Age representations redefine Hawaiian concepts in order to align them to basic New Age trends.&lt;ref name=Rothstein/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Rothstein also gathered opinions and analysis of Huna by native Hawaiians:
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to leading figures on the native-political scene in Hawaii, this kind of New Age representation amounts to straightforward exploitation. People often feel that non-Hawaiians are violating [[Indigenous intellectual property|native intellectual property rights]] and that the out-of-context use of Hawaii’s religious legacy cripples the values that are imbedded in concepts such as kahuna, hula, Lomi Lomi, etc. The very idea that anyone could join a workshop and develop [[kahuna]] skills within a few weeks, for instance, is considered ridiculous as the traditional kahuna’s knowledge depends on a way of life rather than learning. …By importing Hawaiian ethnicity and revivifying what is perceived to be Hawaii’s religious legacy, New Agers from Europe and the United States…do not need the [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiians]] themselves. They need a myth about them, and so they create it… &lt;ref name=Rothstein/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chai writes that Huna books are "examples of [[cultural appropriation]]."&lt;ref name=Chai102/&gt;

According to the standard Pukui and Elbert Hawaiian dictionary, 'unihipili are the spirits of deceased persons, 'uhane is a soul, spirit or ghost, and 'aumakua are family or personal gods, deified ancestors who might assume the shape of animals. [[Kū]], [[Lono]] and [[Kāne]] are Hawaiian gods.&lt;ref name=Pukui/&gt;

In the [[Hawaiian language]], the term ''[[kahuna]]'' is used for any expert. Kahuna include experts in diagnosing illness, herbal medicine, canoe building, temple building, wood carving, star-gazing, agriculture, and others.&lt;ref name=Kamakua6-7&gt;Kamakua, Samuel. ''The People of Old: Ka Po'e Kahiko,'' (Bishop Museum Press,1991) pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
Huna Research Inc was founded by Long in 1945. On his death in 1971, he was succeeded as its head by Dr. E Otha Wingo (in accordance with a request by Long), and moved its headquarters to Missouri, where Wingo was a professor. It has fellowships in Canada, Australia, England, Germany and Switzerland, in addition to the United States.&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lewis | first = James | title = The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions | publisher = Prometheus Books | location = Buffalo | year = 2002 | isbn = 1-57392-888-7 |pages = 406–407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huna International was formed as a religious order in 1973 by King. It has three branches: Aloha International, Voices of the Earth and Finding Each Other International.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3987">'''John Adams''' (c. 1746 – 1817)  was a British politician who sat in the [[House of Commons]] between  1774 and 1780.

Adams was the son of John Adams of [[Whitland]], Carmarthenshire who was [[High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire]] in 1758. His mother was Elizabeth Lloyd, daughter of [[Walter Lloyd (1678-1747)|Walter Lloyd]], M.P  of Peterwell and sister of [[Sir Herbert Lloyd, 1st Baronet]]. He matriculated at [[Queen’s College, Oxford]] on 23 January 1766, aged 19 and was created MA at Oxford in 1773.&lt;ref name = ALUM&gt;{{cite web| url =  https://archive.org/stream/alumnioxonienses01univuoft#page/6/mode/2up| title=Alumni oxonienses: the members of the University of Oxford, 1715-1886| author= Foster, Joseph |publisher= University of Oxford| accessdate = 20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also appears that entered [[Lincoln’s Inn]] in 1765 and was called to the bar in 1772.&lt;ref name = HOP&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/member/adams-john-1746-1817 | title= ADAMS, John (?1746-1817), of Peterwell, Card | publisher= History of Parliament Online| accessdate = 20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1769 he inherited the Peterwell and [[Falcondale]] estates from his uncle Sir Herbert Lloyd, Bt who is said to have shot himself on account of his large debts. The estate was therefore already heavily mortgaged, and Adams amassed more debts and attempted to sell the estate.&lt;ref name=ANW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anws.llgc.org.uk/cgi-bin/anw/fulldesc_nofr?inst_id=1&amp;coll_id=20253&amp;expand=|title=Archives Network Wales - Peterwell and Falcondale Estate Records|website=anws.llgc.org.uk|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father died before 1772.&lt;ref name="nationalarchives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D446965|title=Will of John Adams of Whitland , Carmarthenshire|website=The National Archives|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1776, a London attorney, who held the original mortgage, bought the Peterwell estate.&lt;ref name = ANW/&gt;

Adams was appointed [[High Sheriff of Carmarthenshire]] in 1774.&lt;ref name="thegazette"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/11429/page/1/data.pdf|date=8 February 1774|title=The London Gazette|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In [[British general election, 1774|1774]] he was returned as [[Member of Parliament]] for both [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]] and [[Wendover (UK Parliament constituency)|Wendover]] and decided to take his seat at Carmarthen. He had gained Carmarthen through the interest of [[Griffith Philipps]] but  Philipps dropped him as candidate for Carmarthen in 1780. He considered standing at Cardigan, where his remaining estate gave him an interest, but decided not to enter the poll.&lt;ref name = HOP/&gt;

Long before his death Lloyd had spent his inheritance. He died on 2 June 1817.&lt;ref name = HOP/&gt;

'''Longevity escape velocity''' (sometimes referred to as '''Actuarial escape velocity'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singularity2050.com/2008/03/actuarial-escap.html singularity2050.com/2008/03/actuarial-escap.html]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a term used in the [[Anti-aging movement|life extension movement]].  It is a hypothetical situation in which [[life expectancy]] is being extended longer than the time that is passing.  For example, in a given year in which longevity escape velocity would be maintained, technological advances would increase life expectancy more than the year that just went by.

Life expectancy increases slightly every year as treatment strategies and technologies improve. At present, more than one year of research is required for each additional year of expected life. Longevity escape velocity occurs when this ratio reverses, so that life expectancy increases faster than one year per one year of research, as long as that rate of advance is sustainable.&lt;ref name=mattersnow&gt;{{Citation

'''Michael Farenas''' (born June 10, 1984 in Sorsogon, [[Philippines]]), is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] professional [[Boxing|boxer]].

Born in Sorsogon, Farenas currently resides in [[Redondo Beach, California]], [[California]]. He is a protégé of former world two division champion [[Gerry Penalosa]].

==Fighting style==
A hard hitting southpaw, Farenas is known for his aggressive style and his powerful punches.

==Professional career==

===Featherweight===
Farenas made his professional debut on September 19, 2004 against Octavio Olinar at the Sports and Cultural Complex in [[Mandaue City]], [[Cebu]], Philippines. The bout ended in a technical draw after 2 rounds.

On March 15, 2008, Farenas challenged [[Mexican people|Mexican]] boxer Baudel Cardenas in the undercard of the [[Manny Pacquiao]]-[[Juan Manuel Marquez]] big fight at the [[Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino]] in [[Paradise, Nevada|Paradise]], [[Nevada]]. The Filipino prospect won the bout by a third round technical knockout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Mexican was given five minutes to recover, but he could not continue, forcing the referee to stop the match.

In his next fight, Farenas moved to the super-featherweight division to face Fermin delos Santos. The two fought on May 17, 2008 at the Plaza Monumental in [[Aguascalientes]], Mexico. The Filipino boxer defeated his foe via unanimous decision after 8 rounds. For the fight, the protégé of former WBO bamtamweight champion [[Gerry Peñalosa]] trained under the guidance of [[Freddie Roach (boxing)|Freddie Roach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====First title====
Farenas won the World Professional Boxing Federation featherweight title on October 3, 2009 by stopping South Korean fighter Jae-Bong Jang in 9 rounds.

On March 13, 2010, Farenas was included in the undercard of the Manny Pacquiao-[[Joshua Clottey]] bout. He took on American boxer Joe Morales. The bout ended in a no contest after 2 round, because of an accidental clash of heads that opened a bad cut over Morales' right eye. This forced the ringside doctor to stop the bout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Super Featherweight===
In his next bout, Farenas challenged Marlon "Rata" Aguilar of Nicaragua in the undercard of the Latin Fury 14 pay-per-view, which showcased the return of [[Antonio Margarito]] against [[Roberto Garcia (boxer)|Roberto Garcia]] in [[Aguascalientes]], Mexico. The fight took place on May 8, 2010. Farenas lost by an eight round unanimous decision and practically blew away his chance at a possible world title bout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Fareñas had difficulty handling Aguilar who had the edge during infighting sequences. The Filipino boxer tried to be more aggressive in the third but his momentum was hindered when he landed a low blow. In the 6th round, the referee deducted a point from Farenas for low blows and then again in round eight. The latter was falling way behind on points and needed a knockout to win but he didn’t seem to have the energy or the inclination to try to get it done. Another low blow from the Filipino fighter interrupted the last round action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Farenas went on to win 7 straight fights after the Aguilar fight and a draw against Takashi Uchiyama for the WBA title. He then landed an undercard fight on the Pacquiao-Marquez 4 event on December 8, 2012. He fought highly regarded [[Yuriorkis Gamboa]] in a 12 round battle for the interim WBA strap. Farenas was knocked down twice but rallied to deliver a knockdown of his own in the 9th round. However, Farenas lost via unanimous decision.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boxingscene.com/gamboa-dropped-hard-defeats-gutsy-farenas--60258&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 2013, Farenas fought an outmatched Gerardo Zayas whose record was 19-21-2. Farenas dropped Zayas three times in the first round en route to a TKO win against the journeyman.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/305932/sports/boxing/boxing-michael-farenas-wins-by-first-round-knockout-in-texas&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nardole''' is a fictional character created by [[Steven Moffat]] and portrayed by [[Matt Lucas]] in the long-running [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. He is a [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] of the [[Twelfth Doctor]], an incarnation of the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[time travel in fiction|time traveller]] known as [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]], portrayed by [[Peter Capaldi]]. He initially appeared in the 2015 Christmas special "[[The Husbands of River Song]]" as a companion of [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]], before returning in the following episode "[[The Return of Doctor Mysterio]]", having become the Doctor's companion in the meantime.

Despite looking like an everyday human, Nardole is an alien from the 54th century, with cybernetic implants, belonging to a humanoid colony on the planet Mendorax Dellora. He is the first full-time alien companion of the revived series, and the first in the series in over 30 years.&lt;ref name="doctorwhotvnardole"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/series-10-nardole-is-a-full-time-non-human-companion-82018.htm|title=Series 10: Nardole Is A Full-Time "Non-Human" Companion|date=15 December 2016|publisher=Doctor Who TV|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most companions, Nardole rarely wishes to travel with the Doctor, instead staying safe on Earth in most episodes. Nevertheless, he sometimes gets involved in the Doctor's adventures, mostly against his will.

Nardole is introduced in the 2015 Christmas special "[[The Husbands of River Song]]" as the employee of the Doctor's wife [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] ([[Alex Kingston]]). In the course of the episode, he is decapitated, with his head ending up as part of a cyborg body. In the subsequent Christmas episode, "[[The Return of Doctor Mysterio]]" (2016), Nardole appears again, this time having become a seasoned travelling companion of the Doctor following River Song's departure, the Doctor having managed to rebuild Nardole's body.

For the [[Doctor Who (series 10)|tenth series]], which follows the two specials, Nardole remains the Doctor's assistant. When the series begins, with "[[The Pilot (Doctor Who)|The Pilot]]" (2017), the pair were based in a university in Bristol, where Nardole attempted to keep the Doctor to his oath to guard an alien vault beneath the university. He is concerned about the Doctor taking on [[Bill Potts (Doctor Who)|Bill Potts]] ([[Pearl Mackie]]) as a new travelling companion, maintaining that it amounts to him abandoning his post. Nardole is ultimately dragged on an outer space adventure with the Doctor and Bill in "[[Oxygen (Doctor Who)|Oxygen]]". The subsequent episodes of "[[Extremis (Doctor Who)|Extremis]]", "[[The Pyramid at the End of the World]]" and "[[The Lie of the Land]]", following a story arc over the three episodes, establish that Nardole came to assist the Doctor on instructions left by River Song before she died, and has taken it as his mission to keep the Doctor in line. He formally joined the Doctor after the Doctor took an oath to guard his [[Time Lord]] friend and arch-enemy [[Master (Doctor Who)|Missy]] ([[Michelle Gomez]]) for a thousand years. In the same story, Nardole narrowly escapes a deadly bacterial infection due to his alien biology, and assists Bill and the Doctor in restoring [[free will]] to the Earth after history had been rewritten by the menacing alien "Monks". In several following episodes, Nardole repeatedly shows his resourcefulness and adaptability. In series finale "[[World Enough and Time (Doctor Who)|World Enough and Time]]"/"[[The Doctor Falls]]", the Doctor's crew and Missy react to a distress call on board a [[Mondas]]ian ship, which results in Bill being shot through the heart and converted into a [[Cyberman]],  due to the machinations of Missy's past incarnation, the Master ([[John Simm]]). They escape the immediate clutches of the Cybermen due to Nardole commandeering a shuttle, which he pilots into higher levels of the colony ship. The ship is so large that several simulated countrysides exist within as solar farms, with dozens of villagers. In battle with the Cybermen, Nardole repeatedly proves his computer and combat talents, rigging powerful explosions throughout the countryside. When the Doctor realises that to defeat the Cybermen he must destroy a whole level of the ship, he instructs Nardole to take the villagers to safety on another floor. Nardole does so, unsure if he will ever see the Doctor again, and knowing that the Cybermen will one day return to convert the human population. Lucas reprises the role briefly in "[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]", playing an avatar of Nardole made from Nardole's memories at the time of his death. He hugs the Doctor and wishes him farewell before his pending [[regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]]. In Paul Cornell’s novelisation of the story, it is revealed that the Cybermen stopped being a threat not long after the Doctor left and Nardole lived to an old age with several wives and children.

==Casting and development==
In November 2015, it was announced that [[Matt Lucas]] would appear in "[[The Husbands of River Song]]" as a guest character named Nardole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/entries/10dd7ae7-79c1-4d82-a11b-6e4810ea4251|title=The 2015 Doctor Who Christmas Special|date=24 November 2015|publisher=Official site|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 June 2016, it was confirmed that Nardole would return in the 2016 Christmas special, "[[The Return of Doctor Mysterio]]", as the Doctor's companion and stay in this role in the tenth series until the finale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/entries/6d059f23-2325-4a46-9b5e-cd0ad94b4a59|title=Matt Lucas to join Peter Capaldi and Pearl Mackie for Doctor Who series 10|date=14 June 2016|publisher=Official site|accessdate=14 June 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6iGCFoLmv|archivedate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Moffat]] said that Matt Lucas wanted to play Nardole again and so he used the chance to bring Lucas back as a regular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/moffat-explains-why-hes-bringing-back-matt-lucas-in-series-10-80888.htm|title=Moffat Explains Why He’s Bringing Back Matt Lucas in Series 10 |date=25 August 2016|publisher=Doctor Who TV|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doctorwhotvnardole" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1031">'''Pandolfo da Polenta''' (died 1347) was for a short time the joint lord of [[Ravenna]] and [[Cervia]] from 1346 until his death.

He was the son of [[Ostasio I da Polenta]]. In 1346 he inherited the family lordships together with his brothers [[Bernardino I da Polenta|Bernardino I]] and [[Lamberto II da Polenta|Lamberto II]]. Bernardino, however, had both Pandolfo and Lamberto imprisoned in Cervia after one year, where they died of starvation.

In 2013, Iran was only one of four countries known to have committed [[public execution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 March 2014 |title=Report: Global Executions Up 15 Percent in 2013 |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2014/Report--Global-executions-up-15-percent-in-2013/id-aee8f4301b254a4e9bd2a1c60ed69698 |agency=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Iran, public executions occurred regularly during the [[Qajar dynasty]] but declined with the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]] and became a rare occurrence under the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. With the establishment of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] in 1979, public executions returned on an unprecedented scale.

==Qajar dynasty==
Under the rule of the Qajar dynasty (1785–1925), forms of public execution included hanging, throwing the condemned from the city walls, tying them to the mouth of a cannon and blowing them apart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abrahamian |first=Ervand |year=1999 |title=Tortured Confessions: Prisons and Public Recantations in Modern Iran |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ucTdH9sh1O0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=University of California Press |pages=20 |isbn=9780520218666 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; suffocating them in a carpet, or re-enacting the crime on the criminal. There was also Sham'i ajjin, which entailed making multiple incisions in the body and then lighting candles in the cuts until the person died.&lt;ref name="rejali"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.reed.edu/poli_sci/faculty/rejali/articles/executions.html |title=Executions and Executioners |last=Rejali |first=Darius |year=1997 |publisher=Reed College |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before being brought onto the public scaffold, the condemned was paraded through the bazaar.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1890, public hanging replaced more exotic forms of execution.&lt;ref name="rejali"/&gt; Whereas the failed assassin of [[Naser al-Din Shah]] in 1850 died by Sham'i ajjin, and then had his body quartered and blown from cannons, the assassin of Naser al-Din in 1896 was publicly hanged.&lt;ref name="rejali"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Judicial reform came with the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution]]. In 1909, executions were restricted to hanging and firing squad.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pahlavi dynasty==
Judicial reform progressed in the late 1920s after [[Rezā Shāh]] consolidated Pahlavi rule (1925–1979).&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Executions largely occurred away from public view, and capital punishment was primarily restricted to murder, high treason, and armed rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, 26.&lt;/ref&gt; One rare public execution during this period was the hanging of the doctor of Tehran's Central Jail shortly after Reza Shah was deposed. The doctor and three others were found guilty of murdering political prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic Republic of Iran==
Following the [[Islamic Revolution]] of 1979 and the establishment of the Islamic Republic, public executions became commonplace. The overwhelming majority of public executions were carried out by hanging. Often [[Crane (machine)#Truck-mounted crane|cranes mounted on trucks]] served as makeshift [[gallows]]. The condemned, and in some cases multiple prisoners, generally stood on a platform before a crowd in a stadium or square. The prisoner was lifted high off the ground by crane, with the rope around their neck, leading to a slower death by strangulation.&lt;ref name="amnesty1990"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/021/1990/en/ |title=Iran: Violation of Human Rights 1987-1990 |date=1 December 1990 |publisher=Amnesty International |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reenactment"/&gt; In other instances, the condemned was placed standing on a stool, which was then abruptly removed, leaving the individual to suffocate to death but barely dangling off the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=11 February 2008 |title=Iranian hangings 'hit new record' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7239953.stm |agency=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1990 Amnesty International report, "Flogging prior to execution is relatively common."&lt;ref name="amnesty1990"/&gt;

In some provincial towns, traditional forms of execution such as stoning were revived for moral offenses.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, 126&lt;/ref&gt; At stonings, spectators are encouraged to participate by throwing stones at the condemned. In 1990, [[Amnesty International]] "recorded the first executions carried out by beheading in modern times in Iran."&lt;ref name="amnesty1990"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/021/1990/en/ |title=Iran: Violation of Human Rights 1987-1990 |date=1 December 1990 |publisher=Amnesty International |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of murder the guardian, or a family member, of the victim has the right to perform the public execution or hire another person to do it.&lt;ref name="HoodHoyle2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Hood|author2=Carolyn Hoyle|title=The Death Penalty: A Worldwide Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7S-tBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-870173-6|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Government authorities have generally avoided publicly executing political prisoners because it generates greater domestic and international outcry. Nonetheless, there have still been instances of political prisoners being publicly executed, in some cases under the pretense of them being drug traffickers.&lt;ref name="rejali"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amnesty1990"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, 130.&lt;/ref&gt; In prisons like Evin, political prisoners have been forced to watch or even participate in executions by removing dead bodies. In the 1980s, newly arrived inmates passed rows of hanged prisoners when entering through the main courtyard.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahamian, 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The report by the [[United Nations]] [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]] on the situation of human rights in Iran for the year 2017 notes that of 4,741 executions between 2010 and 2016, 3,210 were based on sentences issued by Revolutionary Courts in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Countries/AsiaRegion/Pages/IRIndex.aspx Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal impact==
In August 2013, a 12-year-old Iranian boy from the province of Kermanshah accidentally hanged himself while re-enacting a hanging with his younger 8-year-old brother. According to [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], the boy was "an unexpected victim of a culture of public executions that remains pervasive in the Islamic republic." Whenever executions are carried out publicly in Iran, children are often among the spectators. Iranian journalist Mokhtar Khandani said, "In Kermanshah, where I reside, I see in many places that street executions are carried out. At such venues, unfortunately I see a lot of children who are there and witness the scene. In the eyes of some children, it might seem like a game."&lt;ref name="reenactment"&gt;{{cite news |date=10 October 2013 |title=Iran's Public Executions Prompt Fatal Reenactment |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/iran-hanging-rights-un/25131488.html |agency=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3503">'''Pulotu''' is the [[underworld|Resting place of those passed on]] in the [[Polynesian narrative]] of [[Tonga]] and [[Samoa]], the world of darkness "lalo fonua" (as opposed to the human world of light).

==Tonga==
In [[Tongan mythology]], Pulotu is presided over by [[Hikule'o|Havea Hikule{{okina}}o]]. In Tongan cosmology the sky, the sea, and Pulotu existed from the beginning, and the gods lived there.  The first land they made for the people was [[Touia'ifutuna|Touia{{okina}}ifutuna]] (''trapped in Futuna''), which was only a rock. There are suggestions that for Tonga and Samoa, Pulotu refers to a real country, in fact [[Matuku Island]] in the [[Lau Islands]]. Tonga and Samoa would have been vassals or tributary confederates of the [[Tu'i Pulotu|Tu{{okina}}i Pulotu]] network in Fiji, which was in turn overshadowed by the Tui Manu'a confederacy of Samoa (which was overturned by the Tu'i Tonga dynasty of Tonga).

After the independence struggle by Hikule{{okina}}o and his cousins [[Maui (Tongan mythology)|Maui Motu{{okina}}a]] and [[Tangaloa (Tongan mythology)|Tangaloa {{okina}}Eiki]], they renamed Touia{{okina}}ifutuna into Tongamama{{okina}}o. Only after that the other islands were made (the volcanic islands by Hikule{{okina}}o and the coral islands by Maui). Finally Tongamama{{okina}}o was renamed, for the last time, as Tonga.

Hikule{{okina}}o is supposed to have married a daughter of Tangaloa {{okina}}Eiki.

==Samoa==
In the [[Samoan mythology|mythology of Samoa]], Pulotu is presided over by the god [[Saveasi'uleo]] (also referred to as '''Elo'''), whose name reveals a similarity to the Tongan god [[Hikule'o|Havea Hikule{{okina}}o]]. Saveasi'uleo is the father of [[Nafanua]] the Goddess of War in Samoa, from the village of [[Falealupo]], the site of the entryway into Pulotu.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nuVCSZOu7IAC&amp;pg=PA123&amp;lpg=PA123&amp;dq=Pulotu+Falealupo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CmYOeVNors&amp;sig=OcmrIbrPE9NYFmEft26OMZeC1Q4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-Iy9Su3LF4GisgPW65g7&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Pulotu%20Falealupo&amp;f=false], Samoa, a Hundred Years Ago and Long Before by George Turner, p.123

'''Radicalization''' (or '''radicalisation''') is a process by which an individual, or group comes to adopt increasingly [[Extremism|extreme]] political, social, or religious ideals and aspirations that reject or undermine the [[status quo]] or contemporary ideas and expressions of the nation. The outcomes of radicalization are shaped by the ideas of the society at large; for example, radicalism can originate from a broad social consensus against progressive changes in society or from a broad desire for change in society. Radicalization can be both violent and nonviolent, although most academic literature focuses on radicalization into [[violent extremism]] (RVE).&lt;ref&gt;Borum, Randy. Radicalization into Violent Extremism I: A Review of Social Science Theories. Journal of Strategic Security. Vol. 4 Issue 4. (2011) pp. 7–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Schmid, A. P. | title="Radicalisation, De-Radicalisation, Counter-Radicalisation: A Conceptual Discussion and Literature Review" | url=https://icct.nl/publication/radicalisation-de-radicalisation-counter-radicalisation-a-conceptual-discussion-and-literature-review/ | publisher= The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism – The Hague (ICCT)}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple pathways that constitute the process of radicalization, which can be independent but are usually mutually reinforcing.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley, C., Mosalenko, S. "Mechanisms of political radicalization: Pathways towards terrorism," Terrorism and Political Violence (2008). 416&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Radicalization: A Guide for the Perplexed. National Security Criminal Investigations. June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radicalization that occurs across multiple reinforcing pathways greatly increases a group’s resilience and lethality. Furthermore, by compromising its ability to blend in with non-radical society and participate in a modern, national economy, radicalization serves as a kind of sociological trap that gives individuals no other place to go to satisfy their material and spiritual needs.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Eli. Radical, Religious, and Violent: The New Economics of Terrorism. MIT Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

There is no universally accepted definition of radicalization. Therefore, no one definition can be presented here. One of the difficulties with defining radicalization appears to be the importance of the context to determine what is perceived as radicalization. Therefore, radicalization can mean different things to different people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Schmid, A. P. | title=Radicalisation, De-Radicalisation, Counter-Radicalisation: A Conceptual Discussion and Literature Review | url=https://icct.nl/publication/radicalisation-de-radicalisation-counter-radicalisation-a-conceptual-discussion-and-literature-review/ | publisher= The International Centre for Counter-Terrorism – The Hague (ICCT)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presented below is a list of definitions used by different governments.

===United Kingdom===

The [[UK Home Office]], [[MI5|MI5’s]] parent agency, defines radicalization as “The process by which people come to support [[terrorism]] and violent extremism and, in some cases, then join terrorist groups.” The MI5 report closes by saying that no single measure will reduce radicalization in the UK and that the only way to combat it is by targeting the at risk vulnerable groups and trying to assimilate them into society. This may include helping young people find jobs, better integrating immigrant populations into the local culture, and effectively reintegrating ex-prisoners into society.&lt;ref&gt;Behavioural Science Operational Briefing Note: Understanding radicalization and violent extremism in the UK.

===Canada===

The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] defines radicalization as "the process by which individuals—usually young people—are introduced to an overtly ideological message and belief system that encourages movement from moderate, mainstream beliefs towards extreme views. While radical thinking is by no means problematic in itself, it becomes a threat to national security when Canadian citizens or residents espouse or engage in violence or direct action as a means of promoting political, ideological or religious extremism. Sometimes referred to as “homegrown terrorism,” this process of radicalization is more correctly referred to as domestic radicalization leading to terrorist violence.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Radicalization: A Guide for the Perplexed. National Security System (NSS). June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;”

===Denmark===
The [[Danish Security and Intelligence Service]] (PET) defines radicalization as “A process by which a person to an increasing extent accepts the use of undemocratic or violent means, including terrorism, in an attempt to reach a specific political/ideological objective.”&lt;ref&gt;PET, “Radikalisering og terror” Center for Terroranalyse (Denmark) October 2009.

== Diversity and commonalities ==

Despite being composed of multifarious pathways that lead to different outcomes and sometimes diametrically opposed ideological purposes, radicalization can be traced to a common set of pathways that translate real or perceived grievances into increasingly extreme ideas and readiness to participate in political action beyond the status quo. Shira Fishman, a researcher at the [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism]], wrote "Radicalization is a dynamic process that varies for each individual, but shares some underlying commonalities that can be explored."&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, Shira., et al. UMD START: Community-Level Indicators of Radicalization: A Data and Methods Task Force. 16 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are many end products of the process of radicalization, to include all manner of extremist groups both violent and nonviolent, a common series of dynamics have been consistently demonstrated in the course of academic inquiry.

==Islamic radicalization==
[[Jihadis]] have a "tried and tested model" of contact with different [[Vulnerability|vulnerable]], and [[extremist]] individuals through online messaging services or [[social media]] platforms, and then rapidly manipulating them towards participating in violent action in their name.&lt;ref name="Jones2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Sam|last2=Wright|first2=Robert|title=Police probe how family man Khalid Masood became a violent zealot|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c20027e8-0ff3-11e7-a88c-50ba212dce4d|accessdate=March 24, 2017|publisher=Financial Times|date=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that [[Raffia Hayat]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim association]] warned that jailed extremists attempt to recruit violent criminals into radical groups so they carry out attacks on the public once released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wood|first1=Vincent|title=British Muslim leader says May MUST crack down on prison radicalisation to beat terror|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/783721/Khalid-Masood-Prison-Radicalised-Theresa-May-jihadi-Ahmadiyya-Muslim-Association|accessdate=March 26, 2017|agency=Sunday Express|date=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been several notable criticisms of radicalization theories for focusing disproportionately on Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kundnani |first1=Arun |date=2012 |title=Radicalization: the journey of a concept |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306396812454984 |journal=Race &amp; Class |volume=54 |issue=2 |pages=3–25 |doi=10.1177/0306396812454984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been concerns that converts to Islam are more susceptible to violent radicalization than individuals born into the faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/westminster-london-terror-attack-terrorist-khalid-masood-convert-muslim-islam-extremism-a7647626.html|title=Why are converts to Islam more likely to become extremists?|date=2017-03-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/muslim-converts-vulnerable-radicalisation-extremism-terror-attacks-isis-henry-jackson-society-report-a8017981.html|title=Muslim converts 'vulnerable to Isis radicalisation', research finds|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-06-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/britain/2017/04/01/converts-to-islam-are-likelier-to-radicalise-than-native-muslims|title=Converts to Islam are likelier to radicalise than native Muslims|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Abdul Haqq Baker developed the '''Convert's Cognitive Development Framework''' that describes how new converts conceptualize Islam and the stages where they are most vulnerable to radicalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/709890472|title=Extremists in our midst : confronting terror|last=1966-|first=Baker, Abdul Haqq,|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=|isbn=9780230296541|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|pages=12|oclc=709890472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutual aid==

[[Eli Berman]]'s 2009 book ''Radical, Religious, and Violent: the New Economics of Terrorism''&lt;ref&gt;Radical, Religious and Violent: The New Economics of Terrorism (MIT Press 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; applies a [[rational choice]] model to the process of radicalization, demonstrating that the presence of [[mutual aid (organization theory)|mutual aid]] networks increase the [[Resilience (organizational)|resilience]] of radical groups. When those groups decide to use violence, they also enjoy a heightened level of lethality and are protected from [[defection]] and other forms of intervention by states and outside groups.

All organizations insofar as they include the possibility of [[free rider problem|free riders]] by extension experience defection constraints. Within the context of a violent extremist organization, defection means either defection to a [[counterintelligence]] or [[security]] apparatus, or defection to a non-radical [[criminal]] apparatus. Both of these outcomes spoil specific plans to exercise violence in the name of the group at large. The “defection constraint” is similar to a [[threshold price-point]] in that it denotes what rewards would justify the defection of any one individual within the context of an [[organization]]. Berman uses the example of a Taliban protection racket for convoys of consumer goods moving through Afghanistan: checkpoints are set up at several points along a trade route, and each checkpoint’s team is given a small percentage of the convoy’s total value if it arrives safely at its destination. The incentive for any one checkpoint’s team deciding to simply hijack a convoy as it passes through, sell the goods off, and escape, increases as the value of the convoy increases. The same dynamic applies to attacks; while an individual in a terrorist group may not feel drawn by the reward of alerting the police to an impending low level crime, the reward for alerting the police to an impending high-profile attack, such as a mass bombing, becomes more attractive. While non-radicalized and criminal organizations can only rely on organizational cohesion through a calculus of greed, fear, and perhaps familial loyalty, Berman argues that religious radicalization greatly increases the defection constraints of radical terrorist organizations by requiring outsized demonstrations of commitment to the cause prior to recruiting operatives.

Mutual aid is the voluntary and reciprocal exchange of goods within an organization. Examples in various religious antecedents include Judaic [[Tzedakah]], Islamic [[Zakat]], and various Christian institutions of charity, as described in the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. Berman argues that religious organizations experience economic risks by extending mutual aid to all alleged believers—theological assent is cheap, action can be costly. By imposing a series of outwardly visible social rules, such as restrictions (or prescriptions) on dress, diet, language, and social interactions, groups impose a cost on entering into a mutual aid partnership, diminishing the occurrence of free riding.

These restrictions have a dual effect in radical groups. Not only do they ensure that an individual is committed to the cause, but they also diminish individual’s access to consumption opportunities and social interaction that might persuade them to distance themselves from the cause. As individuals become more involved with radical activities, their social circles become more constrained, which diminishes contact with non-radicalized persons and further entrenches radicalized thinking. For example, when a young man spends several years in a Yeshiva in order to establish himself within a [[Haredi]] community, he foregoes future earnings that would be accessible should he choose a secular education. To quote Berman “As consumption opportunities are limited, work for pay becomes less appealing, freeing up even more time for community activities.” This [[sunk cost]] figures into future calculations, and raises the defection constraint in a way that non-radicalized group dynamics cannot. Going back to the Taliban convoy example, not only have the two footsoldiers in question have been [[vetted]] by demonstrating commitment to the cause, they also have had their exterior options limited such that it would be difficult to blend into a new environment for lack of skills and cultural understanding. As such, the threshold price point to defect, as represented by the value of the convoy, increases to include both the price of losing their existing support network and non-quantifiable factors such as friends, family, safety, and other goods over the course of their lives.

==Individual pathways==

While the overall arch of radicalization usually involves multiple, reinforcing processes, scholars have identified a series of individual pathways to radicalization. Clark McCauley and Sofia Mosalenko’s 2009 book ''Friction: How Radicalization Happens to Them and Us'' identifies the following sociological and psychodynamic pathways:

===Individual-level factors===

==== Personal grievance ====
This pathway emphasizes revenge for real or perceived harm inflicted upon oneself by an outside party. This initial offense triggers other psychodynamic mechanisms, such as thinking in more stark in-group and out-group terms, lowered inhibitions to violence, and lessened incentives to avoid violence. Chechen “[[Shahidka]]” also known as Black Widows, women who have lost husbands, children, or other close family members in conflict with Russian forces are a good example.

==== Group grievance ====
"Group grievance" radicalization dynamics are similar to those that are primed by personal grievances; the difference is that the subject perceives harm inflicted on a group that she belongs to or has sympathy for. This pathway accounts for the larger portion of political and ethnic radical violence, in which action is taken on behalf of the group at large rather than as an act of personal revenge. Radicalization out of sympathy for an outgroup is rarer, but can be observed in the Weather Underground's attempted alignment with the [[Black Panthers]] and [[Viet Cong]]. The tie between radicalization into [[violent extremism]] through group grievance and [[suicide bombing]] has also been quantifiably demonstrated: perceived threats to proximal identity such as the presence of foreign troops or invasion accounts for the majority of suicide bombings.&lt;ref&gt;Pape, Robert., Feldman, James. ''Cutting the Fuse: The Explosion of Global Suicide Terrorism and How to Stop It''. University of Chicago Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Slippery slope ====
The "Slippery slope" represents gradual radicalization through activities that incrementally narrow the individual’s social circle, narrow their mindset, and in some cases desensitize them to violence. This has also been called the “True Believer” syndrome, as a product of which one becomes increasingly serious about their political, social, and religious beliefs as a product of “taking the next step”. One can begin by participating in nonviolent activities such as mutual aid, wherein the best way to raise one’s in-group social status is to demonstrate seriousness about the cause and increase the level of commitment in terms of beliefs and activities. As an individual commits act after act, sunk costs are developed. Even if activity is initially only ideological or only criminal, the process of radicalization conflates the two such that criminal acts are justified for intellectually radical purposes, and radical purposes are invoked to justify what are ultimately criminal acts.&lt;ref&gt;Post, Jerrold. "Notes on a Psychodynamic Theory of Terrorist Behavior," in ''Terrorism: An International Journal'' Vol. 7 No. 3. 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Love ====
Romantic and familial entanglement is often an overlooked factor in radicalization. Several violent extremist organizations, especially at their origin, owe their structure to a tight-knit group of friends who share religious, economic, social, and sexual bonds. While this example is evident in more extreme cases, such as those of [[Charles Manson]]'s "Family" and other radical [[cult]]s, it also applies to radicalization in secular and orthodox religious environments. Love can serve as a connection between influential figures, connecting their networks of followers through a combination of attraction and loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Della Porta, D. Social movements, political violence, and the state: A comparative analysis of Italy and Germany. Cambridge University Press. 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This particular force was especially notable in [[New Left]] radical groups, such as the American [[Weather Underground]] and the German [[Red Army Faction]]. The connections between [[Bill Ayers]] and [[Bernardine Dohrn]], or between [[Gudrun Ensslin]] and [[Andreas Baader]] served as the organizational and intellectual nucleus of these groups.

==== Risk and status ====
Within a radical group, high-risk behavior, if successful, offers a pathway to status insofar as it becomes re-construed as bravery and commitment to the cause. As such, violence or other radical activity provides a pathway to success, social acceptance, and physical rewards that might otherwise be out of reach. {{quotation | Disproportionate involvement in risk taking and status seeking is particularly true of those young men who come from disadvantaged family backgrounds, have lower IQ levels, are of lower socioeconomic status, and who therefore have less opportunity to succeed in society along a traditional career path. These young men are more likely to be involved in gang activity, violent crime, and other high-risk behavior.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley, C. Mosalenko, S. Friction: How Radicalization Happens to Them and Us. Oxford University press 2009. pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;}}

James Pugel conducted a study, in which Liberian ex-combatants, indicated their motivations to become radicalized were based on the opportunity to increase their economic and social status within their community. There was a belief that radicalized individuals lived better than non-radicalized individuals. Specifically, extremists groups offered compensatory employment, which provided the means for basic needs to be met such as food and housing.In addition, radicalization provided protection and safety from local violence (i.e. abductions) for their entire family. All of which are contributory to the notion of an elevated economic and social status within the community.&lt;ref&gt;Pugel, James. "What the Fighters Say: A Survey of Ex-combatants in Liberia: February - March 2006". United Nations Development Programme, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers such as Alpaslan Ozerdem and Sukanya Podder contend that radicalization “can become the only route to survival, offering protection from torture, abuse, and politically instigated killing."&lt;ref&gt;Ozerdem, Alpaslan and Sukanya Podder. "Youth Radicalization and Violent Extremism". Journal of Strategic Security, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting that in some cases, individuals that did not join, were subjected to an indefinite “insufferable social burden that included demeaning names and labels".&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Robert. "Interviews with Killers: Six Types of Combatants and Their Motivations for Joining Deadly Groups". Studies in Conflict and Terrorism, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unfreezing ====
Loss of social connection can open an individual to new ideas and a new identity that may include political radicalization. Isolated from friends, family, or other basic needs, individuals may begin to associate with unlike parties, to include political, religious, or cultural radicals. This is especially noted in ''prison radicalization'', where individuals bind together over racial, religious, and gang identity to a greater degree than in the outside world and often bring their newfound radical identity beyond prison to connect with radical organizations in the populace at large.&lt;ref&gt;Fighel, John. "The Radicalization Process in Prisons", ''International Institute for Counterterrorism''. presented at NATO workshop, Eliat, 25 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Additional Pathways ====
Robert Barrett is one of the leading researchers in field research with Nigerian terrorist groups. Barrett contributes a unique perspective to this type of research because his studies are conducted with current, not former, members of insurgent groups. Barrett’s 2008 field research study revealed unique typologies and motivations for radicalization as reported by insurgent groups. For instance, individuals that were radicalized expressed sentiments of volunteerism, yet extremist recruiters conveyed that their objective was to make “coercion feel like volunteerism.” Barrett asserted that the motivations to become radicalized can be characterized as: ideologue, combatant, criminals, pragmatist, soldier, and follower.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Robert. "Interviews with Killers: Six Types of Combatants and Their Motivations for Joining Deadly Groups". Studies in Conflict and Terrorism, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideologues uphold a belief that ethnic supremacy is necessary and violence was the means to achieve this truth. Ideologues maintain a “readiness to die for the ethnic group if necessary; survival and preservation of the group or community is more important than survival or preservation of oneself”.

Combatants’ express concerns that their basic survival depends on joining extremist groups. Hence, combatants are not motivated by ideologies and their primary objective is self-preservation.

Criminals are predominantly motivated by their “freedom to carry out activities that would otherwise be deemed illegal”. As such, criminals thrive on instant self-gratification of engaging in violent acts against their enemies. Criminals thrive on conflict and in a sense believe their actions are heroic.

Pragmatists are interested in the benefits of economic and social status mobility. Their goals are in “preserving the structures and environment conducive to either continued success or to newfound success” in wealth, land ownership, and/or mining rights.

Soldiers believe “injustice and insecurity” are mitigating factors for radicalization. Prominent feelings that they have a duty to fight against injustices. Soldiers are motivated by a sense that they can instrumentally affect positive change.

Followers desire a sense of group dependence and attachment to overcome feelings of being an outsider. They are overwhelmingly concerned with social perception. “Ensuring one’s acceptance and preserving or enhancing one’s social status within the community was the most important factor promoting membership”.

===Group-level factors===

Insofar as a group is a dynamic system with a common goal or set of values it is possible that the group’s mindset as a whole can affect individuals such that those individuals become more radical.

==== Polarization ====
Discussion, interaction, and experience within a radical group can result in an aggregate increase in commitment to the cause, and in some cases can contribute to the formation of divergent conceptions of the group’s purpose and preferred tactics. Within a radical group, internal dynamics can contribute to the formation of different factions as a result of internal disillusionment (or, conversely, ambitions) with the group’s activities as a whole, especially when it comes to a choice between violent terrorism and nonviolent activism. The [[Weather Underground]]’s split with [[Students for a Democratic Society]] is one of many examples. The dynamics of group polarization imply that members of this larger group must either commit to one faction and demonstrate their loyalty through further radicalization, or leave the group entirely.

==== Isolation ====
Isolation reinforces the influence of radical thinking by allowing serious and or persuasive members of the group to disproportionately define the body's agenda. When an individual only has access to one in-group social environment, that group gains a totalizing influence over the individual—disapproval would be tantamount to social death, personal isolation, and often a lack of access to the basic services that mutual aid communities fulfill. As an isolated minority, Islamic groups in the West are especially vulnerable to this form of radicalization. Being cut off from society at large through [[language barrier]]s, cultural difference, and occasionally [[discriminatory]] treatment, Muslim communities become more vulnerable to additional pathways of radicalization&lt;ref&gt;Vidino, Lorenzo. ''Countering Radicalization in America: Lessons from Europe''. United States institute of Peace Special Report, Nov. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

One such additional pathway of radicalization of individuals that feel isolated is the Internet. Utilizing data compiled by the Internet World Stats, Robin Thompson contends that the Middle East and North Africa rate of Internet usage is “above average” in comparison to other countries, yet in countries where Internet availability is more widespread, individuals are “more likely to be recruited and radicalized via the Internet.” Hence, the Internet, specifically social media sites such as extremists’ chat rooms and blogs, “lures its users with a promise of friendship, acceptance, or a sense of purpose.”&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Robin L. "Radicalization and the Use of Social Media". Journal of Strategic Security, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Competition ====
Groups can become radicalized vis-a-vis other groups as they compete for [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] and prestige with the general populace. This pathway emphasizes increased radicalization in an effort to outdo other groups, whether that increase is in violence, time spent in religious ritual, economic and physical hardship endured, or all four. Religious movements and the terrorist elements that form in their name display this characteristic. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} While in some cases there may be [[doctrinal]] or [[ethnic]] differences that motivate this kind of competition, its greatest outward sign is an increased demand by the group for commitment to radical actions. {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Mass radicalization===
[[File:Mao1938a.jpg|thumb|right|Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] writing ''On Protracted War'' in 1938.]]

==== Jujitsu politics ====
Also called "the logic of political violence", Jiujitsu politics is a form of [[Asymmetric warfare|asymmetrical]] [[political warfare]] in which radical groups act to provoke governments to crack down on the populace at large and produce domestic blowback that legitimates further violent action.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley, C. Jiutitsu Politics: Terrorism and response to terrorism. In P.R. Kimmel &amp; Chris Stout (Eds.), ''Collateral Damage: The psychological consequences of America's War on Terrorism''&lt;/ref&gt; The primary purpose of a radical group using this tactic is not to destroy the enemy outright, but to make the enemy strike at political and ideological moderates, such that the existing political order loses its claim on [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] while the radical group gains legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Rosebraugh, Craig. The Logic of Political Violence. PW Press. Portland, OR. 2004&lt;/ref&gt; By destroying moderates, radical groups encourage a bifurcated society and use state's reactions to violence as a justification for further violence.&lt;ref&gt;Marighella, C. Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla. J. Butt and R. Sheed (trans.) Havana, Transcontinental Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Al-Qaeda]]'s strategy of luring the West, specifically the [[United States]], into ground wars in Islamic states that polarize the [[Ummah]] against the West while avoiding engagements that would allow the American military to draw on its technical superiority is an example of jiujitsu politics. [[David Kilcullen]], Counterinsurgency advisor to [[David Petraeus]] during the [[Iraq Surge]], has called this the "accidental guerrilla syndrome".&lt;ref&gt;KilCullen, David. ''The Accidental Guerrilla: Fighting Small Wars in the Midst of a Big One''. Oxford University Press. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

This tactic is also pillar of [[Maoist]] [[insurgency]] and serves both the purposes of tactical and ideological advantage.

==== Hatred ====
In protracted conflicts the enemy is increasingly seen as less human,&lt;ref&gt;Royzman, E.E., McCauley, C., Rozin, P. From Plato to Putnam: Four ways of thinking about hate. In R.J. Sternberg (ed.) ''The Psychology of Hate'' pp. 3–35. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; such that their common humanity does not readily trigger natural inhibitions against violence. This involves "essentializing" both the self and enemies as respectively good and evil entities. The Islamist use of [[Takfirism]], or ([[apostasy]]), to justify the murder of non-radical Muslims and nonbelievers (''[[kafir]]'': "pagans") is an example of this. [[Hannah Arendt]], in [[The Origins of Totalitarianism]] outlines a similar dynamic that contributed to the ideologies of [[pan-slavism]], [[Nazism]], and [[antisemitism]], where an [[in-group]] constructs an exalted [[self identity]] for political purposes and mobilizes against out-groups in order to solidify that identity.&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Hannah. ''The Origins of Totalitarianism''. Schocken Books. 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; This dynamic of hatred is not unique to [[rightist]] groups. The Weathermen and Red Army Faction often characterized police officers and government officials as “pigs” worthy of death and subhuman treatment.

==== Martyrdom ====
[[Martyrdom]] implies that the person in question died for a cause or is willing to die for a cause. The symbolic impact of martyrdom varies across cultures, but within the field of radicalization the act or pursuit of martyrdom denotes the absolute value of a radical’s way of life.

==Misconceptions==

=== Poverty ===
The association between radicalization and poverty is a myth. Many terrorists come from middle-class backgrounds and have university-level educations, particularly in the technical sciences and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17730424 |title=Exploding misconceptions |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=16 December 2010 |website=The Economist |access-date=7 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no statistical association between poverty and militant radicalization.&lt;ref&gt;Baylouni, A.M. ''Emotion, Poverty, or Politics? Misconceptions About radical Islamist Movements''. Connections III, No. 1, Vol. 4. pp. 41–47 Available at: http://faculty.nps.edu/ambaylou/baylouny%20emotions%20poverty%20politics.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; As outlined above, poverty and disadvantage may incentivize joining a mutual aid organization with radical tendencies, but this does not mean that poverty proper is responsible for radicalization.

=== Mental illness ===
Though personal psychology does play a significant part in radicalization, mental illness is not a root cause of terrorism specifically or ideological radicalization broadly. Even in the case of [[suicide terrorism]], psychological pathologies, such as depression and [[schizophrenia]] are largely absent.&lt;ref&gt;Pape, Robert. ''Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism''. Random House. 2005. https://www.amazon.com/Dying-Win-Strategic-Suicide-Terrorism/dp/1400063175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pape, Robert., Feldman, James.

{{nihongo|'''''Robot Carnival'''''|ロボット・カーニバル|Robotto Kānibaru}} is a Japanese anthology [[original video animation]] (OVA) released in 1987 by [[A.P.P.P.]]. In North America, it was released in theaters by [[Streamline Pictures]] with the order of the segments slightly rearranged. This OVA has gained a small cult following.{{cn|date=July 2016}} 

It consists of nine shorts by different well-known directors, many of whom started out as animators with little to no directing experience. Each has a distinctive animation style and story ranging from comedic to dramatic storylines. The music was composed by [[Joe Hisaishi]] and [[Isaku Fujita]] and arranged by Joe Hisaishi, Isaku Fujita and [[Masahisa Takeichi]].

== Segments ==
===Opening / Ending===
The {{nihongo|"Opening"|オープニング|Ōpuningu}} takes place in a desert. A boy finds a small "coming soon" poster advertising the Robot Carnival, and becomes frightened and agitated. He warns the people in his village, most likely to escape, when a huge machine with many robots performing in niches on its exterior grinds its way right over the village. Once a magnificent traveling [[Variety show|showcase]], it is now a decayed, rusted, malfunctioning, engine of destruction.

In the {{nihongo|"Ending"|エンディング|Endingu}} segment (the ninth segment of the OVA), the ''Robot Carnival'' is stopped by a dune in the desert. Unable to climb the sandy obstruction, the Carnival stalls at its base.  As the sun sets over the traveling relic, flashback stills recall the grandeur of the Carnival at the peak of its existence—an unparalleled engine of mirth that brought timeless joy to the various cities it visited. At sunrise, we see the platform chug forward with a sudden burst of power and crest over the dune in its way. The final push proves to be too much for the aged contraption, and it finally goes to pieces in the desert. The bulk of the OVA's credits are then shown concluding with an epilogue.

In the epilogue at the end of the credits, set years later, a man discovers an orb among the remains and brings it back to his family. It is a [[music box]] featuring a miniature robot ballerina. As it dances, the children applaud. The ballerina finishes its dance with a leap into the air and explodes, blowing up the shack where the family lived, leaving "END" in enormous letters lying in its place as the only survivor, the family's pet [[llama]], struggles to regain his footing.

===Franken's Gears===
{{nihongo|"Franken's Gears"|フランケンの歯車|Furanken no Haguruma}} was directed by [[Kōji Morimoto]]. A [[mad scientist]] tries to give life to his robot with lightning, just like [[Frankenstein]]. When it comes to life, the robot copies everything the scientist does. Overjoyed, the scientist dances with glee, trips, and falls. Seeing this, the robot dances, trips, and falls on the scientist, killing him.

===Deprive===
In "Deprive", an alien invasion of robot foot soldiers attacks a city and kidnaps people, including a young girl. Her companion, an [[android (robot)|android]], is damaged, but retains her locket. A human with superhuman abilities is then seen who goes through waves of robots before being stopped by two powerful robots. Captured by the alien leader he is tortured, but it is also revealed to be the Android from earlier, now upgraded into a combat Android with a human disguise. Defeating the two powerful robots and the alien leader, he rescues the girl. Running through the wasteland carrying her, the girl eventually wakes up and recognizes his new form because of the locket he still has.

===Presence===
{{nihongo|"Presence"|プレゼンス|Purezensu}}, one of only two segments featuring intelligible dialogue, tells the story of a man who has an obsession with a [[Gynoid]] he has been secretly constructing in an attempt to compensate for the lack of any close relationship with his wife and family. The setting seems to be British and of the early twentieth century, but also suggests another planet or a future which has attempted to re-establish a former social structure. When the Gynoid takes on a personality of her own, far beyond what the man had programmed, he smashes her in a fit of panic, and leaves his secret laboratory for what he believes is the last time. Twenty years later, the man has a vision of his Gynoid appearing before him, but then blowing up before he can take her hand. He returns to his shed to find the Gynoid still sitting smashed in a corner, just as she had been left years earlier. Another twenty years elapse, and the Gynoid appears again before the man. This time, he takes her hand and walks into the distance with her, before vanishing in front of his shocked wife. 

Little of the dialogue is actually spoken on-screen - all but a few lines are given in voice-over, or with the speaker's mouth obscured.

===Star Light Angel===
"Star Light Angel" is a [[bishōjo]] story featuring two friends—teenage girls—at a robot-themed [[amusement park]]. One of the girls finds that her boyfriend is now going out with her friend. Running away in tears, she finds her way to a virtual reality ride. Though pleasant at first, her memory causes the ride to summon a giant laser-breathing mecha. One of the park's robots finds himself in the role of knight in shining armor, allowing her to let go of her darker emotions, and to move forward in her life. The visual style of this segment was heavily influenced by the music video for [[A-ha]]'s "[[Take on Me]]."&lt;ref&gt;''Robot Carnival Original Motion Picture Soundtrack.'' (CD liner notes).

===Cloud===
"Cloud" features a robot walking through time, and the evolution of man. The backdrop is animated with clouds that depict various events of the universe, such as the modernization of man as well as the self-destruction of man. Eventually, the same angel who cries for his immortality makes him human towards the end. The animation is done in a [[scratchboard]] or rough [[etching]] style.

{{nihongo|"Strange Tales of Meiji Machine Culture: Westerner's Invasion"|明治からくり文明奇譚〜紅毛人襲来之巻〜|Meiji Karakuri Bunmei Kitan: Kōmōjin Shūrai no Maki|retitled "A Tale of Two Robots, Chapter 3: Foreign Invasion" for the Streamline dub}}  is set in the nineteenth century and features two "giant robots" directed from within by a human crew. In the style of a movie serial of the sound era, a Westerner in his giant robot attempts to take over Japan, but is challenged by locals operating a "machine made for the parade"—a Japanese giant robot. The style of this segment is somewhat reminiscent of a Japanese [[World War II]]-era [[propaganda]] film. Despite the title of this segment, there is no known prequel or sequel.  The Westerner speaks English in the original release.

==Release==
The OVA was released in Japan on [[VHS]] and [[laserdisc]] on July 21, 1987 through JVC. [[Carl Macek]] licensed the OVA and released it in theaters and on video in North America in the late 1980s. 

A limited edition Region 2 DVD of ''Robot Carnival'' was released in Japan through Beam Entertainment in November 2000. A Region 1 DVD of ''Robot Carnival'' was released in the United States by [[Discotek Media]] in 2015 and a Blu-ray was released in 2018.

===Streamline Pictures English dub===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}

The script for the English-dubbed version of "A Tale of Two Robots" is slightly different from the original Japanese version and even adds a few lines that are not present in the original version.  In addition, a passing reference to [[Japan|Japan's]] 1854 opening to foreign trade is removed and the foreign antagonist's English dialogue is re-recorded.

Some versions of the English-dub of the release by [[Streamline Pictures]] shuffled the order of the segments and modified the "Ending" segment by removing the still images of the "Robot Carnival," placing the two animated segments next to each other, and placing all of the credits at the very end of the OVA. The still images of the "Robot Carnival" were most likely removed due to Streamline's practice of removing all onscreen [[kanji]] from their anime releases in order to "Americanize" them. Streamline's producer [[Carl Macek]] stated with certainty that the reason for the "shuffling of segments" was due to considerations regarding the theatrical exploitation of the OVA.  

The various segments were received separately and then subsequently assembled to fill out 2000&amp;nbsp;ft reels. In order to keep the actual distribution of the theatrical release manageable, the segments were arranged to minimize reel changes - otherwise it would have required additional reels and therefore additional reel changes to keep the product in its original order and would have added to the cost of the distribution. The decision was mutually agreed upon between Streamline and APPP Regarding the credit sequence and the use of still images - the original production company did not have the proper neutral closing credits available that are required for international distribution, therefore it was mutually decided to create this new closing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/anncast/2010-01-14|title=ANNCast - Macek Training}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rodney Allen Brooks''' (born 30 December 1954&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/471/000128087/|title=Rodney Brooks|work=[[NNDB]]|accessdate=23 January 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825181942/http://www.nndb.com/people/471/000128087/|archivedate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an Australian [[robotics|roboticist]], [[Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science]], author, and robotics entrepreneur, most known for popularizing the [[behavior based robotics|actionist approach]] to robotics. He was a Panasonic Professor of Robotics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and former director of the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]]. He is a founder and former Chief Technical Officer of [[iRobot]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.csail.mit.edu/brooks/companies.html Companies – CSAIL People – MIT]&lt;/ref&gt; and co-Founder, Chairman and Chief Technical Officer of [[Rethink Robotics]] (formerly Heartland Robotics). Outside the scientific community Brooks is also known for his appearance in a film featuring him and his work, ''[[Fast, Cheap &amp; Out of Control]]''.&lt;ref name="BeyondComput"&gt;[http://edge.org/conversation/beyond-computation Beyond computation]: a talk with Rodney Brooks, Edge, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Brooks received a M.A. in pure mathematics from [[Flinders University]] of South Australia.

In 1981, he received a PhD in Computer Science from [[Stanford University]] under the supervision of [[Thomas Binford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{mathgenealogy|name=Rodney Allan Brooks|id=61090}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He has held research positions at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and a faculty position at [[Stanford University]]. He joined the faculty of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1984. He was Panasonic Professor of Robotics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He was director of the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] (1997–2007), previously the "Artificial Intelligence Laboratory".

Brooks left MIT in 2008 to found a new company, Rethink Robotics (formerly Heartland Robotics), where he serves as chairman and Chief Technical Officer.

==Work==
===Academic work===
Instead of [[computation]] as the ultimate [[conceptual metaphor]] that helped [[artificial intelligence]] become a separate discipline in the scientific community, he proposed that ''action'' or ''[[behavior]]'' are more appropriate to be used in robotics. Critical of applying the computational metaphor, even to the fields where the action metaphor is more appropriate, he wrote that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some of my colleagues have managed to recast Pluto's orbital behavior as the body itself carrying out computations on forces that apply to it. I think we are perhaps better off using Newtonian mechanics (with a little Einstein thrown in) to understand and predict the orbits of planets and others. It is so much simpler.&lt;ref name="UltimateMetaphor"&gt;[http://www.edge.org/q2008/q08_5.html#brooks Computation as the Ultimate Metaphor]: "What have you changed your mind about?", Edge, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 1990 paper, "Elephants Don't Play Chess",&lt;ref name="elephants"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Brooks|first=RA| title= Elephants don't play chess| journal= Robotics and Autonomous Systems| volume= 6| year =1990| pages= 139–159| url =http://www.liralab.it/teaching/ROBOTICA/docs/brooks.1990.pdf| doi=10.1016/s0921-8890(05)80025-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks argued that in order for robots to accomplish everyday tasks in an environment shared by humans, their higher cognitive abilities, including abstract thinking emulated by symbolic reasoning, need to be based on the primarily [[sensory-motor coupling]] (action) with the environment, complemented by the [[Proprioception#Components|proprioceptive sense]] which is a key component in [[hand–eye coordination]], pointing out that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Over time there's been a realization that vision, sound-processing, and early language are maybe the keys to how our brain is organized.&lt;ref name="BeyondComput"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;Editor positions
Brooks was also co-founding editor of the [[International Journal of Computer Vision]] and is on the editorial boards of various journals including:
*[[Adaptive behavior]]
*[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/loi/artl Artificial Life] MIT Press Journal

*Founding fellow of the [[American Association for Artificial Intelligence]] (AAAI)
*Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS)
*Member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]] (NAE)
*In 2005 he was inducted as a [[ACM Fellow|Fellow]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fellows.acm.org/fellow_citation.cfm?id=2810307&amp;srt=alpha&amp;alpha=B | title=Rodney A Brooks | work=ACM Fellows | publisher=ACM | year=2005 | accessdate=2010-01-23 | quote=For contributions to artificial intelligence and robotics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Australian Academy of Science]], Corresponding Member 2006

===Industrial work===
Brooks was an entrepreneur before leaving academia to found Rethink Robotics. He was one of ten founders of [[Lucid Inc.#Initial success|Lucid Inc.]], and worked with them until the company's closure in 1993. Before Lucid closed, Brooks had founded [[iRobot]] with former students [[Colin Angle]] and [[Helen Greiner]].

===Robots===
[[File:Caught Coding (9690512888).jpg|thumb|Robot at Rethink Robotics, 2013. Brooks is at the right in the lineup behind the robot. At left is [[Steve Jurvetson]], the photographer.]]
He experimented with off-the-shelf components, such as [[Fischertechnik]] and [[Lego]], and tried to make robots self-replicate by putting together clones of themselves using the components. His robots include mini-robots used in [[oil wells]] explorations without cables, the robots that searched for survivors at [[Ground Zero]] in New York, and the robots used in medicine doing [[robotic surgery]].&lt;ref name="BeyondComput"/&gt;

;Allen
In the late 1980s, Brooks and his team introduced [[Allen (robot)|Allen]], a robot using [[subsumption architecture]]. {{As of|2012}} Brooks' work focuses on engineering intelligent robots to operate in unstructured environments, and understanding human intelligence through building humanoid robots.

;Baxter
{{main|Baxter (robot)}}
Introduced in 2012 by Rethink Robotics, an [[industrial robot]] named Baxter was intended as the robotic analogue of the [[personal computer#|early personal computer]] designed to safely interact with neighboring human workers and be programmable for the performance of simple tasks. The robot stopped if it encountered a human in the way of its robotic arm and has a prominent off switch which its human partner can push if necessary. Costs were projected to be the equivalent of a worker making $4 an hour.&lt;ref name=NYT91812&gt;{{cite news |title=A Robot With a Reassuring Touch |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/science/a-robot-with-a-delicate-touch.html |accessdate=18 September 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=18 September 2012 |author=John Markoff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ronald W. Hughes''' (March 16, 1935 – [[Circa|c.]] November 1970) was an American [[Lawyer|attorney]] who represented Charles Manson.

Hughes disappeared while on a camping trip during a ten-day recess from the [[Charles Manson#Trial|Tate-LaBianca murder trial]] in November 1970. His body was found in March 1971, but his cause of death could not be determined. At least one Manson family member has claimed that Hughes was murdered by the family in an act of retaliation. No one has been charged in connection with his death.

==Tate–LaBianca murder trial==
Hughes was among the first lawyers to meet with [[Charles Manson]] in December 1969. Initially, he signed on as the attorney for Manson, but was replaced by [[Irving Kanarek]] two weeks before the start of the trial.&lt;ref name=rhughes&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020804022431/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/manson/mansonothers.html The Charles Manson (Tate–LaBianca Murder) Trial: Other Key Figures]&lt;/ref&gt;

He eventually represented [[Leslie Van Houten]] in the Tate–LaBianca murder trial. Hughes failed the [[Performance test (bar exam)|bar exam]] three times before passing and had never tried a case. Hughes, a onetime [[conservative]], was called "the [[hippie]] lawyer" due to his intimate knowledge of the hippie [[subculture]]. That knowledge occasionally served his client well. He was able to raise questions about [[Linda Kasabian]]'s credibility by asking her about [[hallucinogenic drugs]], her belief in [[Extra-Sensory Perception|ESP]], her thoughts that she might be a [[witch]], and her experiencing "vibrations" from Manson.&lt;ref name=rhughes /&gt;

As attorney for [[defendant]] Van Houten, Hughes tried to separate the interests of his client from those of Charles Manson, a move that angered Manson and may have cost Hughes his life. He hoped to show that Van Houten was not acting independently, but was completely controlled in her actions by Manson. This strategy contradicted Manson's plan to allow fellow family members to implicate themselves in the crimes, clearing him of all involvement.&lt;ref name=rhughes /&gt;

Twenty-two weeks into the trial, which included outbursts and bizarre behavior from Manson and his co-defendants, the [[prosecution]] rested. Lawyers for the defendants stunned the courtroom by announcing that the defense also rested.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bugliosi|1994|pp=503–504}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Atkins]], [[Patricia Krenwinkel]] and Leslie Van Houten immediately shouted that they wanted to [[testify]]. Per Manson's instructions, the women said that they wanted to testify to committing the murders on their own and that Manson had nothing to do with the crimes. Hughes objected and stood up against Manson's ploy and stated, "I refuse to take part in any proceeding where I am forced to push a client out the window."&lt;ref name=crimelib&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Manson made a statement to the court, however, he then told the women that they no longer had to testify. [[Charles Older|Judge Charles Older]] then ordered a ten-day recess to allow the attorneys to prepare for their final arguments. Hughes later told a reporter that he was confident that he could secure an acquittal for Van Houten.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bugliosi|1994|pp=508, 514}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
On November 27, 1970, Hughes decided to take a camping trip in a remote area near Sespe Hot Springs in [[Ventura County, California]]. According to James Forsher and Lauren Elder, two friends who accompanied Hughes on the trip, heavy rains which had caused [[flash flood]]s in the area had mired their [[Volkswagen]] in mud. Forsher and Elder hitchhiked their way out, while Hughes decided to stay in the area until November 29. As the rains continued, the wilderness area was evacuated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sanders|2002|p=437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes was last seen by three campers on the morning of November 28. They later told investigators that Hughes was alone at the time and had briefly stopped to talk with them. Hughes also appeared to be unharmed and was in an area that was away from flood waters. When court reconvened on November 30, Hughes failed to appear. Due to continued rainstorms, the Ventura County sheriff had to wait two days before a search was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bugliosi|1994|pp=514–515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, Judge Older ordered the trial to proceed and appointed a new attorney, Maxwell Keith, for Van Houten. The women angrily demanded the firing of all their lawyers, and asked to reopen the defense. Judge Older denied the request. By week's end, Hughes had been missing for two weeks. When the court reconvened, Manson and the women created a disturbance suggesting that Judge Older "did away with Ronald Hughes," which resulted in their being removed again from the courtroom.&lt;ref name=crimelib /&gt;

==Death==
Over the following months, police conducted more than a dozen searches of the area where Hughes was last seen. After receiving an anonymous tip in March 1971, police also searched in the area surrounding the [[Barker Ranch]] in [[Inyo County]] where Manson and his associates had previously lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VnZKAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4872,3821481&amp;dq=ronald+hughes+did+away+with+ronald+hughes|title=New Search Slated For Attorney|date=March 21, 1971|work=The Press-Courier|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, 1971, the same day the jury returned [[capital punishment|death penalty]] verdicts against all the defendants on all counts, Hughes' severely decomposed body was discovered by two fishermen in [[Ventura County]]. His body was found wedged between two boulders in a gorge,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cielodrive.com/archive/tate-lawyers-body-believed-to-be-found/|title=Tate Lawyers Body Believed To Be Found - Charles Manson Family and Sharon Tate-Labianca Murders Archive|website=www.cielodrive.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes was later positively identified by dental [[X-rays]]. Due to the severe decomposition of his body, the cause and nature of his death was ruled as 'Undetermined'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bugliosi|1994|p=624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His funeral was held on April 7, 1971 in [[West Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WmFLAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7231,1730627&amp;dq=ronald+hughes+attorney+van+houten|title=Ronald Hughes, Tate Trial Attorney, Receives Eulogy|date=April 8, 1971|work=The Press-Courier|page=22|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes was buried in [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in Los Angeles.

==Aftermath==
In his book ''[[Helter Skelter (book)|Helter Skelter]]'', [[Vincent Bugliosi]] wrote that [[Sandra Good]], an associate of Manson and a close friend of devoted Manson family member [[Lynette "Squeaky" Fromme]], claimed that Manson family members had killed "35 to 40 people" and that, "Hughes was the first of the retaliation murders."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bugliosi|1994|p=625}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney Stephen Kay, who helped Bugliosi prosecute the Manson family members, stated that while he is "on the fence" about the Manson family's involvement in Hughes' death, Manson had open contempt for Hughes during the trial. Kay added, "The last thing Manson said to him [Hughes] was, 'I don't want to see you in the courtroom again,' and he was never seen again alive."&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/01/local/la-me-manson-tapes-20120601/2|title=Manson follower's tapes may yield new clues, LAPD says|last=Becerra|first=Hector|author2=Winton, Richard |date=June 1, 2012|publisher=latimes.com|page=2|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retired Ventura County sheriff Charlie Rudd, who was assigned to investigate Hughes' disappearance, stated that he felt Hughes' death was accidental because there were no signs of foul play. Rudd believes that Hughes was stranded by the rainstorm which caused the creek to swell. He believes that Hughes drowned or was knocked unconscious and killed by rocks and debris as he was swept away by the water.&lt;ref name="latimes" /&gt; Musician and author [[Ed Sanders]], who was a friend of Hughes, wrote about his death in his 1971 book ''The Family''. He stated therein that his death was due to accidental drowning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sanders|2002|p=438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Leslie Van Houten was granted a new trial on the grounds that she was denied proper legal representation after Hughes disappeared before the closing arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NDNcAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6897,1264185&amp;dq=ronald+hughes+attorney+manson+did+away|title=Manson Follower Has Right To New Trial|date=December 10, 1976|work=Merced Sun-Star|page=2|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Houten's retrial in 1977 ended in a [[hung jury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7GUzAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6098,226702&amp;dq=ronald+hughes+van+houten+retrial|title=A third murder trial for Van Houten is scheduled|date=September 2, 1977|work=Lodi News-Sentinel|page=20|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was released from jail after posting $200,000 bond and retried in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=m4YsAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6708,2082254&amp;dq=ronald+hughes+van+houten+bail|title=Manson Follower In Court|date=August 10, 1978|work=Herald-Journal|page=B7|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her third trial, Van Houten was convicted of the first degree murders of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca and conspiracy in connection with the [[Tate murders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2_BLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3-0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3495,1683277&amp;dq=ronald+hughes+van+houten+bail|title=Manson's follower convicted of murder|date=July 6, 1978|work=The Spokesman-Review|page=1|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was sentenced to [[Life imprisonment|life in prison]].

[[File:SS Charles S. Price.jpg|left|thumb|Bow of the SS ''Charles S. Price'' before sinking into Lake Huron.]]
The '''SS ''Charles S. Price''''' was a steel hulled ship lost on [[Lake Huron]] on November 9, 1913 during the [[Great Lakes storm of 1913]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://images.maritimehistoryofthegreatlakes.ca/55997/data?n=1 |title=Maritime History of the Great Lakes |accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Price'' was found on 10 November 1913 with her bow above water, and her stern dipping below. Because of her disposition, the ship's length could not be measured to make a positive identification of the vessel: the wreck was initially assumed to be the ''[[SS Regina (1907)|Regina]]''. The vessel was eventually identified as the ''Price'' before she sank on 17 November.

The salvage rights to the ''Price'' were sold to the Great Lakes Towing and Wrecking company. In the summer of 1916, salvage of the ''Price'' was attempted. Divers cut a hole in the side of the aft hull. The hole allowed divers to enter the wreck. They attempted to seal breaks in the hull and built bulkheads so that the wreck could be floated. However, salvaging the wreck was eventually considered too costly to be worth the expense and the Great Lakes Towing and Wrecking company abandoned attempts to raise her.

Salvage rights were eventually sold to the American Salvage Co., but they too were unable to salvage the wreck.

'''Silicon Heaven''' is an [[afterlife]] concept from the British [[science fiction]] comedy series ''[[Red Dwarf]]''. It is where electronic equipment goes after [[death]]. The concept is used to keep [[robot]]s, many of which are stronger and more intelligent than their masters, from rebelling; a [[belief]] chip is installed in robots{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} to ensure that they will believe that they will go to Silicon [[Heaven]] after a life of servitude to humanity.

The central concept is that robots are programmed to believe that when they die they go to "silicon heaven", even though everyone else knows they just get dismantled.&lt;ref name="ubon"&gt;Ubon Ratchathani, ''[[New Scientist]]'' (2009): Volume 201, Issues 2689-2699, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon Heaven can be seen as a parody of the human predisposition to believe in life after death.&lt;ref name="ubon"/&gt;

The concept was introduced in the episode "[[The Last Day (Red Dwarf)|The Last Day]]" (1989), in which the service mechanoid [[Kryten]] ([[Robert Llewellyn]]), on learning that he is to be replaced by a more advanced model of mechanoid, tells human second technician [[Dave Lister|Lister]] ([[Craig Charles]]) that he is resigned to his fate as he knows he will receive his reward in Silicon Heaven. Lister's attempts to convince Kryten that Silicon Heaven doesn't really exist meet with no success; although Kryten later tells his replacement, Hudzen-10 ([[Gordon Kennedy (actor)|Gordon Kennedy]]), that there is no Silicon Heaven, causing Hudzen to break down when he attempts to cope with the idea, he admits to Lister that he only said it to confuse Hudzen, and that Kryten knew that he was lying. Kryten tells Lister in this episode that equipment that go to Silicon Heaven include robots, calculators, toasters and hairdryers.&lt;ref name="lastday"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Last Day |episode-link=The Last Day (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=19 December 1989 |season= |series-no=III |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cheap robots such as [[Red Dwarf characters#The Skutters|skutters]] are sometimes not fitted with a belief chip due to cost,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} but [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]]{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and Kryten hang on to the belief.&lt;ref name="lastday"/&gt;

However, in the episode "[[The Inquisitor (Red Dwarf)|The Inquisitor]]" (1992), as Kryten tells Lister that he believes in Silicon Heaven, his right knee then starts jiggling (a reflex to lying) suggesting that Lister has shaken his belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Inquisitor |episode-link=The Inquisitor (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Juliet |last3=May |author-link3=Juliet May |first4=Grant (directors) |last4=Naylor |author-link4=Grant Naylor |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=27 February 1992 |season= |series-no=V |number=2 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Krysis]]" (2016), Kryten states that he's "just lately... started" to think the idea of an afterlife for machines is "preposterous".&lt;ref name="krysis"&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Krysis |episode-link=Krysis |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |date=20 October 2016 |season= |series-no=XI |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[Can of Worms (Red Dwarf)|Can of Worms]]" (2016), Kryten mentions that a mercenoid is a droid who sacrifices his life in exchange for software updates in Silicon Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Can of Worms |episode-link=Can of Worms (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |date=27 October 2016 |season= |series-no=XI |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the books{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} it is revealed that when Holly's intelligence was at its peak he didn't believe in Silicon Heaven, but as his [[IQ]] slowly declined his faith became "unshakable". According to the novel ''[[Backwards (novel)|Backwards]]'' (1996), the concept of Silicon Heaven was eventually replaced with a variant on [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Three Laws of Robotics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grant |first=Rob |author-link=Rob Grant |date=5 February 1996 |title=Backwards |title-link=Backwards (novel) |url= |location= |publisher=[[Viking Books]] |page= |isbn=0-670-84574-4 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "Silicon [[Hell]]" is also referred to several times in the TV series. In the episode "[[Gunmen of the Apocalypse]]" (1993), the simulant captain's ([[Denis Lill]]) last words are, "See you in Silicon Hell!" as his ship is destroyed around him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Gunmen of the Apocalypse |episode-link=Gunmen of the Apocalypse |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Andy (director) |last3=de Emmony |author-link3=Andy de Emmony |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=21 October 1993 |season= |series-no=VI |number=3 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Rimmerworld]]" (1993) when preparing to board the wreckage of the aforementioned simulant ship for supplies, Lister says, "Lets hope the crew are rotting in Silicon Hell along with all the photocopiers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Rimmerworld |episode-link=Rimmerworld |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Andy (director) |last3=de Emmony |author-link3=Andy de Emmony |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=4 November 1993 |season= |series-no=VI |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Out of Time (Red Dwarf)|Out of Time]]" (1993), when the crew believes that Lister is a mechanoid because of an unreality pocket, Kryten pushes Lister to work with the threat of wallowing in "the eternal fires of Silicon Hell."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Out of Time |episode-link=Out of Time (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Andy (director) |last3=de Emmony |author-link3=Andy de Emmony |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=11 November 1993 |season= |series-no=VI |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "Krysis", Kryten mentions that appliances which are pledged to the "wrong manufacturer" aren't allowed into Silicon Heaven, and believes that it's "so unfair that all the [[BlackBerries]] burn in Silicon Hell".&lt;ref name="krysis"/&gt;

The '''4-Toluene Sulfonate Uptake Permease (TSUP) family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.102 TC# 2.A.102]) is also referred to as the TauE/SafE/YfcA/DUF81 Family.  Although its members have not been rigorously characterized, evidence is available that at least some members function in the transport of sulfur containing organic compounds.  These include 4-toluene sulfonate which may be transported by the TsaS of ''Cupriavidus necator'' (TC# 2.A.102.1.1), sulfolactate which may be exported by the TauE protein of ''Cupriavidus necator'' (TC# 2.A.102.2.1) &lt;ref name=Weinitschke&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinitschke|first1=S|last2=Denger|first2=K|last3=Cook|first3=AM|last4=Smits|first4=TH|title=The DUF81 protein TauE in Cupriavidus necator H16, a sulfite exporter in the metabolism of C2 sulfonates.|journal=Microbiology|date=September 2007|volume=153|issue=9|pages=3055–60|pmid=17768248|doi=10.1099/mic.0.2007/009845-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayer&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayer|first1=J|last2=Denger|first2=K|last3=Hollemeyer|first3=K|last4=Schleheck|first4=D|last5=Cook|first5=AM|title=(R)-Cysteate-nitrogen assimilation by Cupriavidus necator H16 with excretion of 3-sulfolactate: a patchwork pathway.|journal=Archives of Microbiology|date=November 2012|volume=194|issue=11|pages=949–57|doi=10.1007/s00203-012-0825-y|pmid=22797525|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1239682|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sulfoacetate which may be exported by the SafE1 protein of ''Neptuniibacter caesariensis'' (TC# 2.A.102.2.2).&lt;ref name="Krejcík"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krejcík|first1=Z|last2=Denger|first2=K|last3=Weinitschke|first3=S|last4=Hollemeyer|first4=K|last5=Paces|first5=V|last6=Cook|first6=AM|last7=Smits|first7=TH|title=Sulfoacetate released during the assimilation of taurine-nitrogen by Neptuniibacter caesariensis: purification of sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase.|journal=Archives of Microbiology|date=August 2008|volume=190|issue=2|pages=159–68|doi=10.1007/s00203-008-0386-2|pmid=18506422|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-67590|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another member of the TSUP family, TsaS of ''Comamonas testosteroni'', has been reported to function in the uptake of 4-toluene sulfonate.&lt;ref name=Mampel&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mampel|first1=J|last2=Maier|first2=E|last3=Tralau|first3=T|last4=Ruff|first4=J|last5=Benz|first5=R|last6=Cook|first6=AM|title=A novel outer-membrane anion channel (porin) as part of a putatively two-component transport system for 4-toluenesulphonate in Comamonas testosteroni T-2.|journal=Biochemical Journal|date=October 1, 2004|volume=383|issue=1|pages=91–9|pmid=15176949|doi=10.1042/bj20040652|pmc=1134047}}&lt;/ref&gt;  None of these functional assignments can be considered to be certain.&lt;ref name=TCDB&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saier|first1=MH Jr.|title=2.A.102.

'''Mark Howard James''' (born October 16, 1961) professionally known as '''The 45 King''' (also known as ''DJ Mark the 45 King''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 45 king addressing his stage name|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGsyuKKlPxU&amp;t=15s|website=The 45 King's official YouTube channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;), is an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] [[record producer]] and [[disc jockey]] (DJ) from [[The Bronx]] borough of [[New York City]]. James began DJing in [[New Jersey]], in the mid-1980s. His [[pseudonym]], the 45 King, came from his ability to make beats using obscure [[45 record|45 RPM records]].

The 45 King first gained fame with his [[breakbeat]] track "The 900 Number" in 1987. The song featured a looping of a [[baritone sax]] solo from [[Marva Whitney]]'s "Unwind Yourself" (1968). The 45 King signed with [[Tuff City Records]] that year and given a production deal. "The 900 Number" remains his signature work, having been resampled by many artists. He was also featured on the ''1989-Hustlers Convention'' album on the UK label Music of Life, which is considered by many{{Who|date=April 2011}} to be hip-hop's first-ever live album.

Using his popularity from the previous release, the 45 King was able to help the other members of his crew, dubbed the [[Flavor Unit]], which included many well-known hip-hop acts including [[Chill Rob G]], [[Lakim Shabazz]], [[Apache (rapper)|Apache]], and [[Queen Latifah]]. The 45 King's big break came when Queen Latifah signed with [[Tommy Boy Records]] in 1989 and released the album ''[[All Hail the Queen]]''. The 45 King did extensive production on this album, and it is considered by critics{{Who|date=April 2011}} to be among his best production work. Over the next few years, many other Flavor Unit members also signed with Tommy Boy, and the 45 King frequently contributed to their albums with his productions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} In November 1989, the re-release of "The King is Here" / "The 900 Number" peaked at #60 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], his only appearance in a [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[record chart|chart]].&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

In the early 1990s, [[drug addiction]] took its toll on the 45 King's career, which caused him to lose a production deal that he signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Around this time the 45 King released multiple series of breakbeat records (the ''Lost Breakbeat'' series, the ''Breakapalooza'' series, etc.) and remixed Madonna's Top-10 single "[[Keep It Together (Madonna song)|Keep It Together]]", but he stayed mainly with his breakbeat record franchises.

In July 1990, Manchester-born DJ [[Chad Jackson (DJ)|Chad Jackson]] sampled "The 900 Number" on his single "[[Hear the Drummer (Get Wicked)]]", which reached #3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums 2"&gt;{{cite book

In 1996, [[Washington, D.C.]]-based [[Go-go music|go-go]] artist DJ [[DJ Kool]] had a hit with the song "[[Let Me Clear My Throat]]". It was a call-and-response vocals over a chopped half of the "900 Number" beat. DJ Kool did not just sample the track: he also acknowledged the 45 King's as the song's originator, and the 45 King remixed the track for Kool.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 1998, the 45 King produced "[[Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)]]" for [[Jay-Z]]. The song was a hit that featured a looped chorus from the original cast album of the Broadway musical ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]''. Jay-Z also did an interview when he spoke about how important the 45 King has been to hip hop music and considers him a true pioneer of the business. In 2000, he produced the platinum-certified track "[[Stan (song)|Stan]]" for [[Eminem]].

The second '''USS ''Conestoga'' (SP-1128/AT-54)''' was an ocean-going [[tug]] in the [[United States Navy]].  Commissioned in 1917, it disappeared in the Pacific Ocean in 1921.  The fate of the vessel was a mystery until its wreck was positively identified in 2016.

== Construction ==
The tug was built for the [[Reading Company#Philadelphia and Reading Railway: 1896–1923|Philadelphia and Reading Railway]] as the ''Conestoga'' in 1904 by [[Maryland Steel Company]], [[Sparrows Point, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bethlehem Steel Company, Sparrows Point MD|url=http://www.shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/2large/inactive/bethsparrowspoint.htm|website=Shipbuilding History|publisher=Tim Colton|accessdate=24 March 2016|location=Delray Beach, FL|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303191419/http://www.shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/2large/inactive/bethsparrowspoint.htm|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was purchased on 14 September 1917 for the [[World War I]] duty and designated '''SP-1128'''. She was commissioned on 10 November 1917, Lieutenant (junior grade) C. Olsen, USNRF, in command.

==Service history==
[[File:USS Conestoga's ship's company, 1921.png|left|thumb|''Conestoga''{{'}}s crew in 1921.]]
Assigned to the [[Submarines in the United States Navy|Submarine Force]], ''Conestoga'' carried out towing duties along the Atlantic coast, transported supplies and guns, escorted convoys to [[Bermuda]] and the [[Azores]], and cruised with the American Patrol Detachment in the vicinity of the Azores. At the end of the war she was attached to Naval Base No. 13, Azores, from which she towed disabled ships and escorted convoys until her arrival at [[New York City|New York]] on 26 September 1919. She was then assigned to harbor tug duty in the 5th Naval District at [[Norfolk, Virginia]].

''Conestoga'' (which had received the hull number '''AT-54''' in July 1920) went to the Pacific in late 1920. She was at [[San Diego, California]] and [[Mare Island, California]], during the first three months of 1921. On 25 March of that year the tug steamed out of Mare Island, with a barge of coal sailing via Pearl Harbor to take up an assignment as station ship at [[Tutuila]], [[American Samoa]].&lt;ref name="smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/discovery-uss-conestoga-researchers-have-solved-naval-mystery-was-nearly-100-years-old-180958538/ |title=With the Discovery of the USS Conestoga, Researchers Have Solved a Mystery That Was Nearly 100 Years Old |website=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |date=March 23, 2016 |first=Suzy |last=Khimm |accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commanded by Lt. Ernest Larkin Jones, ''Conestoga'' was not heard from again. Despite an extensive search, the only trace found of her at the time of her loss was a lifeboat bearing the initial letter of her name found near [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="smithsonian" /&gt;

==Rediscovery==
[[File:Conestoga-stern-001 noaa-teledyne-seabotix.jpg|thumb|left|Stern view of the shipwreck, colonized with sea anemones.]]

Her wreck was discovered in 2009, as an unidentified shipwreck in the [[Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary]], a few miles from Southeast Farallon Island, just off the [[San Francisco]], [[California]] coast. In October 2015, a joint [[NOAA]] and Navy mission confirmed the wreck was the ''Conestoga'' and on 23 March 2016, 95 years after the ship was lost, a formal announcement was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barakat|first1=Matthew|title=Navy tugboat lost for a century found off California coast|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/e2a0eb393f7d43bebd97731e961f1e7a|accessdate=23 March 2016|agency=Associated Press|date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/after-95-years-a-navy-ship-lost-at-sea-with-all-hands-is-finally-discovered/2016/03/22/ebe2e29c-eba7-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html?tid=pm_local_pop_b|title=After 95 years, a Navy ship lost at sea with all hands is finally discovered|author=Michael E.

They made it to within three quarters of a mile from the farm, but had to stop when their horses could pull the sled no further. The eldest brother, Adolph, bundled up his siblings and left them to find help. His father, Gust Wohlk, found the 14-year-old's body within a quarter mile of their farm. Gust Wohlk found his three younger sons curled up together in the box of the wagon. One of the boys was dead and the two others were dying.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;

==Early life and education==

Born into a [[Jewish]] family&lt;ref name=wired-mag&gt;[https://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/10/mf_milner/all/ Wired Magazine: "How Russian Tycoon Yuri Milner Bought His Way Into Silicon Valley" By Michael Wolff] 21 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mousumi Saha Kumar|title=Self-Made Billionaire Investor Yuri Milner Sets $3 Million Prize for Physics|url=http://www.successstories.co.in/self-made-billionaire-investor-yuri-milner-sets-3-million-prize-for-physics/|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 11 November 1961 in Moscow, Yuri Milner was the second child of Russian intellectuals.&lt;ref name="forbes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0328/billionaires-11-profile-yuri-milner-billionaire-friended-web.html |title=The Billionaire Who Friended the Web |publisher=Forbes |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-18 |first=Parmy |last=Olson}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His father, {{ill|Bentsion Zakharovitch Milner|ru|Мильнер, Бенцион Захарович}}, was active in the sphere of management and organisation. He was Chief Deputy Director at the Institute of Economics of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guu.ru/info.php?id=1978 |title=Официальный сайт Государственного Университета Управления |publisher=Guu.ru |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betty Iosifovna Milner, Yuri's mother, worked at the capital's state-run virological laboratory for disease control. His older sister, eight years his senior, is an architect.

Milner studied [[theoretical physics]] at [[Moscow State University]], graduating in 1985. He went on to work at [[Lebedev Physical Institute]], one of the institutes of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], in the same department as the [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Vitaly Ginzburg]]. As a doctoral candidate in particle physics, Milner befriended Soviet [[nuclear physicist]] and [[human rights]] activist [[Andrei Sakharov]]. Sakharov's forward thinking would later influence Milner's venture investment strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Parmy Olson |url=https://blogs.forbes.com/parmyolson/2011/03/10/yuri-milner-billionaire-facebook-day-in-the-life/ |title=A Day In The Life Of Yuri Milner, Web Billionaire s |publisher=Blogs.forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, Milner became the first non-[[émigré]] from the Soviet Union to go to the United States to receive an [[MBA]] at the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="forbes1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/movers_and_shakers/article6391401.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Mike | last=Harvey | title=Big shot Yuri Milner makes logical expansion of his network | date=30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press quoted him as saying that he made this decision after "being disappointed in myself as a physicist".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/newsmaker-yuri-milner-115072301441_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Milner was a commencement speaker for Wharton Business School 2017 class. &lt;ref&gt;https://graduation.wharton.upenn.edu/graduation-speakers/wharton-graduation-2017-speakers-announced/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlwMm5XehPg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
Milner started his business career selling [[grey market]] DOS computers in the Soviet Union, which displeased his father. When the national government collapsed, he stopped selling computers to enroll at the Wharton School to earn an MBA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher=WIRED | title=How Russian Tycoon Yuri Milner Bought His Way Into Silicon Valley | url=https://www.wired.com/2011/10/mf_milner/all/1 | author=Michael Wolff | date=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating, Milner spent the first half of the 1990s at the [[World Bank]]  in [[Washington, D.C.]], as a Russian banking specialist focused on the development of private sector banking. He has described his time at the World Bank as his "lost years", due to watching from afar the privatization of government holdings during the presidency of [[Boris Yeltsin]].&lt;ref name="forbes1"/&gt; In the spring of 1995, Milner was appointed CEO of Alliance-Menatep, an [[investment broker]]age company belonging to then oligarch [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]]. In December 1996 Milner worked as Vice President and Head of Investment Management of Menatep Bank. In February 1997 Milner was appointed the deputy chairman and the head of the investment division of [[Menatep Bank]] but left this position in early 1998&lt;ref&gt;http://moneymakerfactory.ru/spravochnik/yuriy-milner-istoriya-biznesa/&lt;/ref&gt;. At the time, the market makers described him as "a well-known professional, who will bring the bank valuable experience in international financial institutions and transactions in the Russian investment market"&lt;ref&gt;https://lenta.ru/lib/14190841/&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Russian Internet investor===

In 1999, after reading a review by [[Morgan Stanley]] analyst [[Mary Meeker]] on the prospects for online businesses, Milner decided to create an internet company. He sought funding from his friend from Menatep days Gregory Finger, who at the time led the Russian branch of the US investment fund New Century Holding.  The fund agreed to invest $4.5&amp;nbsp;million with the proviso that Milner and Finger each personally invest $750,000. Milner, Finger, and NCH created a new company, NetBridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lenta.ru/lib/14190841/#43|title=Мильнер, Юрий|website=lenta.ru|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, Milner became the president of Netbridge Services Ltd (netBridge) – the company that was, "created as an Internet incubator and investment fund".  Netbridge succeeded in transferring a variety of U.S.-pioneered internet business models to Russia, creating companies including the portal List.ru, online auction site Molotok.ru (based on [[eBay]]), free web-hosting Boom.ru (based on [[GeoCities]]), and online shop 24×7, using the formula of [[Amazon.com]].

In February 2001, netBridge and Port.ru (which owned Mail.ru) announced a merger. Milner became CEO of the new company named Mail.ru (though the legal name Port.ru was also retained).

From January 2003 to December 2004, Milner was the CEO of "Neftyanoi", owned by [[Igor Linshits]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In 2005, NCH shifted its focus from Russian Internet projects and Milner founded the investment fund Digital Sky Technologies (DST), becoming its chairman in 2006. A meeting through mutual friends resulted in [[Alisher Usmanov]] becoming a shareholder of Mail.ru Group in 2008.

In 2010 Mail.ru Group completed successful [[initial public offering]] on the [[London Stock Exchange]] with market valuation of $5.6&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;Mail.Ru Group IPO Pricing Announcement http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news-detail.html?announcementId=10706676{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Milner stepped down from the role of chairman of Mail.ru and from the board of directors.&lt;ref name="corp.mail.ru"&gt;Mail.ru Group press release http://corp.mail.ru/en/press/news/1339&lt;/ref&gt; Dmitry Grishin was elected to the board and appointed as chairman while retaining his CEO position. There were no other changes to management or to the board.

Post Mail.ru Group’s IPO, DST is the sole vehicle for further international investments. The company is now fully independent of Mail.ru Group.&lt;ref&gt;Mail.ru Group prospectus {{cite web|url=http://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/7389V_-2010-11-5.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=10 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317075041/http://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/7389V_-2010-11-5.pdf |archivedate=17 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From May 2009 to January 2012 Milner was a member of the Commission on Modernization established by [[Dmitry Medvedev]], the Russian President from 2008 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://premier.gov.ru/en/|title=Dmitry Medvedev - The Russian Government|work=premier.gov.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Internet investor===

In January 2009, while in [[Palo Alto]], Milner became acquainted with [[Facebook]] founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. The meeting led to an agreement on 26 May 2009 under which DST bought a 1.96% stake in Facebook for $200&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gustin|first=Sam|title=Time Tech 40: The Most Influential Minds in Tech|url=http://business.time.com/2013/05/01/time-tech-40-the-ten-most-influential-tech-ceos/slide/yuri-milner-dst/|publisher=Time|accessdate=12 February 2014|date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 September 2010, Digital Sky Technologies (DST) changed its name to "Mail.ru Group".  The group's portfolio included Mail.ru, Odnoklassniki.ru, [[ICQ]], a minority stake in the social network [[VKontakte]] (Russian Facebook equivalent), online payments service OSMP.ru, e‑Port, as well as some other Russian assets.  Milner's commercial interests in Facebook, Zynga, and Groupon were transferred to [[DST Global]].  Milner became the CEO of DST Global and the chairman of the board of directors of Mail.ru Group. In November 2010, Mail.ru Group held its [[Public offering|offering]] on the [[London Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail.ru Group Limited Announces Intention to Conduct an Initial Public Offering and Listing on the London Stock Exchange|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20101010005091/en/Mail.ru-Group-Limited-Announces-Intention-Conduct-Initial#.UvvtQUJdXso|publisher=BusinessWire|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 2012, Milner stepped down from the role of chairman of Mail.ru and from the board of directors.&lt;ref name="corp.mail.ru"/&gt; Milner focused on international Internet investments.

===Breakthrough Prize===
{{main|Breakthrough Prize}}

In July 2012, Yuri and Julia Milner established the [[Breakthrough Prize]], joined the following year by [[Sergey Brin]], [[Priscilla Chan (philanthropist)|Priscilla Chan]], [[Anne Wojcicki]] and [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. The Prize is a set of international awards recognizing three fields of endeavor: [[Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics]], [[Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences]], and [[Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics]]. Laureates receive $3 million each in prize money, making the Breakthrough Prizes the largest scientific awards in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2013/02/science-prizes Take that, Alfred.], The Economist&lt;/ref&gt; There are also New Horizons awards in physics and mathematics for younger researchers who have already produced significant work.

Committees of previous laureates choose the winners from candidates nominated in a process that is online and open to the public.&lt;ref name="BTP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://breakthroughprize.org/?controller=Page&amp;action=page&amp;page_id=4|title=Breakthrough Prize: About|website=Breakthrough Prize}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017|March}}, $174.8m in prize-money has been awarded to 70 individual scientists and four large research teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakthroughprize.org|title=Breakthrough Prize|work=breakthroughprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prizes are presented annually at a gala ceremony featuring celebrity presentations, films, comedy and live music. The last four ceremonies took place at [[Hangar One (Mountain View, California)]]. The annual celebrations also includes symposiums in the three recognized fields. The program is broadcast live on the web.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.msri.org/general_events/21230 Breakthrough Prize Symposium] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414065535/https://www.msri.org/general_events/21230 |date=14 April 2015 }}, Mathematical Sciences Research Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakthrough Initiatives===

{{main|Breakthrough Initiatives}}

In July 2015, Milner launched [[Breakthrough Initiatives]], a scientific program to investigate the question of life in the [[Universe]]. He announced the initiatives at the [[Royal Society]] in London, alongside [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Martin Rees]], [[Frank Drake]], [[Geoff Marcy]] and [[Ann Druyan]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news| url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/search-for-extraterrestrial-intelligence-nets-historic-cash-infusion/ | work=Scientific American | title=Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Nets Historic Cash Infusion.  | date=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three initiatives have been announced so far:

* [[Breakthrough Listen]]
* [[Breakthrough Message]]
* [[Breakthrough Starshot]]

The first, Breakthrough Listen, will invest $100 million over 10 years in a search for evidence of civilizations beyond Earth.&lt;ref&gt;

The second initiative, Breakthrough Message, will be a $1 million annual prize for digital messages representing Earth and humanity, that could be decoded by another civilization. The messages will not be sent into space until a global discussion on the ethics of such a move has taken place.&lt;ref name="The New York Times"/&gt;

The third project, Breakthrough Starshot, was announced 12 April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/stephen-hawking-interstellar-travel-starmus-speech&lt;/ref&gt; Starshot is a US$100 million program to develop a proof-of-concept [[light sail]] spacecraft fleet capable of making the journey to [[Alpha Centauri]] at 20% the [[speed of light]] (60 million m/s or 215 million km/h) taking about 20 years to get there, and about 4 years to notify Earth of a successful arrival.&lt;ref name="NYT-20160412-db"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=A Visionary Project Aims for Alpha Centauri, a Star 4.37 Light-Years Away |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/science/alpha-centauri-breakthrough-starshot-yuri-milner-stephen-hawking.html |date=12 April 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=12 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Stone |first=Maddie |url=https://gizmodo.com/a-russian-billionaire-and-stephen-hawking-want-to-build-1770467186 |title=Stephen Hawking and a Russian Billionaire Want to Build an Interstellar Starship |work=Gizmodo |date=12 April 2016 |accessdate=12 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Starshot home"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://breakthroughinitiatives.org/Initiative/3 |title=Breakthrough Starshot |work=Breakthrough Initiatives |date=12 April 2016 |accessdate=12 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the researchers, 692 stars were analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/breakthrough-listen-first-detection-results-2017-4?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=A Russian tycoon's $100 million effort to listen for aliens has published its first results|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-05-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakthrough Junior Challenge===

In September 2015, the Breakthrough Prize launched the Breakthrough Junior Challenge,&lt;ref&gt;[https://breakthroughjuniorchallenge.org/about], breakthroughjuniorchallenge.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconbeat.com/2015/09/14/whiz-kids-wanted-for-breakthrough-junior-challenge-with-250000-prize/?doing_wp_cron=1488114979.6444370746612548828125], silicon beat.com&lt;/ref&gt; a science competition for people between thirteen and eighteen years of age, in collaboration with [[Khan Academy]].

==Long-term vision==
Milner believes that the internet will develop into a "[[global brain]]"—which is often described as an intelligent network of individuals and machines—functioning as a nervous system for the planet Earth. He also envisages that the advent of the [[internet of things]] and ever increasing use of [[social media]] will increase humans' [[collective intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;Chrystia Freeland: [http://blogs.reuters.com/chrystia-freeland/2011/09/23/the-advent-of-the-global-brain/ The advent of the global brain]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Parr:[http://mashable.com/2010/11/16/could-facebook-become-the-basis-for-artificial-intelligence/ Could Facebook Become the Basis for Artificial Intelligence?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In an interview with ''[[Vedomosti]]'' in 2010, Milner said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the past few years I simply do not have time for hobbies. I am even starting to forget what I was fond of. Such as in the past it was reading of literature not related to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/articles/2010/12/28/nastupaet_era_lyudej_s_matematicheskim_skladom_uma_yurij | work=Vedomosti | first1=Anastasia | last1=Golitsyn | first2=Igor | last2=Tsukanov | title=There is coming an era for people with a mathematical state of mind | date=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Milner is married to former [[Haute couture|high fashion]] [[Model (profession)#Fashion models|model]] and contemporary artist Julia Milner ([[Married and maiden names|''née'']] Bochkova). She is interested in [[photography]]: during the 52nd Venice Biennale of Contemporary Art she produced a contribution entitled ''Click I Hope''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.russiandreams.info/en/photographer/milner | work=Russian Dreams Info | title=RUSSIAN DREAMS | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Milner bought a $100&amp;nbsp;million home in [[Los Altos Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/04/01/BUH21INM5M.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Kathleen | last=Pender | title=Yuri Milner buys $100 million Los Altos Hills home | date=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The compound spans three plots totaling seven hectares and includes a roughly {{convert|25500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} main house and a {{convert|5500|sqft|m2|adj=on}} guest house. The current tax bill is about $304,000 a year. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported the price as $100&amp;nbsp;million, saying it was the most ever paid for a single-family home in the United States. The property is [[Real estate appraisal|appraised]] by the [[Santa Clara County]] assessor at $50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_20998327/russian-mogul-yuri-milner-silicon-valley-mansion-worth-half-its-price-100-million|title=Russian tycoon's Silicon Valley mansion worth half its $100 million purchase price, assessor says|work=mercurynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milner lives in [[Silicon Valley]] with his family.&lt;ref name="bloombergtechconference2016.sched.com"/&gt; Milner attends synagogue, but says that he is only minimally religiously observant.&lt;ref name=wired-mag/&gt;
