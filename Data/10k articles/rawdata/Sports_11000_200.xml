      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5862">The '''men's individual all-round''' competition at the [[2006 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships]] was held in [[Aarhus, Denmark]].

[[Kim Dae-Eun]] of [[South Korea]] withdrew from competition before the final started, but the information did not get in time to [[Eugen Spiridonov]] of [[Germany]], who thus missed the final and only 23 gymnasts took part in the competition. The organizers officially apologized for that to the German Gymnastics Union already during the final.

The '''36th [[Chess Olympiad]]''', organized by the [[Fédération Internationale des Échecs]] (FIDE) and comprising an open&lt;ref&gt;Although commonly referred to as the ''men's division'', this section is open to both male and female players.&lt;/ref&gt; and a women's tournament, as well as several events designed to promote the game of [[chess]], took place between October 14 and October 31, 2004, in [[Calvià]] on the [[Spain|Spanish]] island of [[Majorca]]. There were 129 teams in the open event and 87 in the women's event. In total, 1204 players were registered (some of whom did not play, though).

Both tournament sections were officiated by [[International Arbiter|international arbiter]] [[Ignatius Leong]] ([[Singapore]]). Teams were paired across the 14 rounds of competition according to the [[Swiss system tournament|Swiss system]]. The open division was played over four boards per round, whilst the women's was played over three. In the event of a draw, the tie-break was decided by 1. The [[Buchholz system]]; 2. Match points; 3. The [[Sonneborn-Berger]] system; and 4. The [[Buchholz system|Median Buchholz]] system.

The [[time control]] for each game permitted each player 90 minutes for all their moves, with an additional 30 seconds increment for each player after each move, beginning with the first.

==Open event==

The open division was contested by 129 teams representing 125 nations. Spain, as hosts, fielded three teams, whilst the ''[[International Braille Chess Association]]'' (IBCA) and the ''International Physically Disabled Chess Association'' (IPCA) each provided one squad.

Led by first board [[Vasyl Ivanchuk]], the seventh highest-[[ELO rating|rated]] player at the tournament, who recorded 9½ points over 13 rounds, and second reserve [[Sergey Karjakin]] who, aged just 14 years, won 6 of his 7 games (surrendering a [[draw (chess)|draw]] only to American [[Gregory Kaidanov]]), [[Ukraine]] scored all four possible points in each of their first three matches before "only" defeating Russia 2½-1½ in the fourth round, eventually accumulating a nearly insurmountable three-point lead after the penultimate round. The Ukrainian team nevertheless scored three points against France and claimed their first title, three points ahead of Russia, who had entered the tournament as the top [[seed (sports)|seed]], having brought four of the tournament's nine highest-rated players, and as defending six-time champions.

[[Armenia]], one of just four teams to draw a match with Ukraine, paced by second board [[Levon Aronian]], who did not lose in 12 games, and third board [[Rafael Vaganian]], who scored 8½ points in 11 games, lost 1½-2½ to Russia in the eighth round. Ultimately, on the strength of a 3½-½ final round defeat of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], they tied Russia's 36½ points. Armenia were placed after Russia, though, on the [[Buchholz chess rating|Buchholz]] [[tiebreaker|tie-breaker]] system employed by the Olympiad, and finished, as in the [[35th Chess Olympiad|previous Olympiad]], with the [[bronze medal]]s. Hosts [[Spain]], led by [[Alexei Shirov]], just managed to squeeze into the top ten.

Notable absentees from the tournament were the no. 1 player in the world, [[Garry Kasparov]], as well as classical World Champion [[Vladimir Kramnik]] and his challenger [[Peter Leko]], who were just finishing their [[Classical World Chess Championship 2004|championship match]] (Kramnik retained his title with a 7-7 tie). FIDE Champion [[Rustam Kasimdzhanov]] was present, however, and led [[Uzbekistan]] to 14th place by going undefeated in his 8 games (+4-0=4).

==Women's results==

The women's division was contested by 87 teams representing 84 nations. Spain, as hosts, fielded two teams, whilst the ''[[International Braille Chess Association]]'' (IBCA) and the ''International Physically Disabled Chess Association'' (IPCA) each provided one squad.

[[China]], led by first board [[Xie Jun]] (ex-World Champion) and second board [[Xu Yuhua]] (future champion), entered the competition as top [[seed (sports)|seed]] and defending triple champions and quickly took the lead, conceding just two [[draw (chess)|draws]] in their first five matches They then defeated the silver and bronze medallists from the [[35th Chess Olympiad|previous Olympiad]], [[Russia]] and [[Poland]] (each 2-1), in the sixth and eighth rounds, respectively. Eventually they carried a six-point lead into a tenth round match with second placed [[United States]].

[[Susan Polgar]] (another ex-World Champion), who entered the tournament as the second highest-rated player and achieved the best performance rating of all, drew Xie Jun, while [[Irina Krush]] won her second board game against Xu Yuhua. A draw by [[Anna Zatonskih]] against [[Zhao Xue]] gave the Americans a 2-1 win over the Chinese team.  In rounds eleven and twelve, China drew [[Hungary]] and lost to [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], whilst the US team defeated [[Slovakia]] and then scored a 2½-½ victory over [[Hungary]], drawing within three points of China with two rounds remaining.  China, though, defeated sixth-seed [[India]] and 12th-seed [[Slovakia]] in the final two rounds, scoring four points to preserve what was ultimately a three-point win and to clinch the [[Vera Menchik]] Trophy for a fourth consecutive time.

Second-seed [[Russia]] were led by [[Nadezhda Kosintseva]], who won top honours on the first reserve board for scoring 10 points in 12 rounds. The Russians were only in eighth place after ten rounds but had advanced to fourth place entering the penultimate round, where they faced [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], who they trailed by half a point. Although first board [[Maya Chiburdanidze]] (ex-World Champion) and second board [[Nana Dzagnidze]], who both scored 8½ points for their team over the event, drew their matches, third board [[Lela Javakhishvili]] lost to Kosintseva, giving the Russian team a half-point lead over Georgia; although Georgia defeated [[Ukraine]] 2½-½ in the final round, Russia managed to secure two points against France, equalling Georgia's total and winning the bronze medals on [[tiebreaker|tie-breaks]].

Newly crowned [[Women's World Chess Championship|World Champion]] [[Antoaneta Stefanova]] disappointed as captain of the [[Bulgaria]]n team, scoring only 5½ points in 11 games. Bulgaria eventually finished in 14th place.

==Overall title==

The [[Nona Gaprindashvili]] Trophy is awarded to the nation that has the best average rank in the open and women's divisions. Where two or more teams are tied, they are ordered by best single finish in either division and then by total number of points scored.

The trophy, named after the former women's World Champion (1961–78), was created by FIDE in 1997.

==Controversies==

===Azmaiparashvili incident===

Prior to the closing ceremony of the Olympiad, FIDE vice president [[Zurab Azmaiparashvili]] was arrested by the local [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] as he attempted to ascend the stage. Security officers, in conjunction with local police, did not permit Azmaiparashvili access to tournament organizers, and a struggle ensued after which Azmaiparashvili, having sustained several injuries, was arrested; he secured his release on [[bail]] for [[Euro|€]]500 after having been held for 40 hours, and the charges against him were later dropped.

A [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n, Azmaiparashvili undertook to inform the presenter of the [[Nona Gaprindashvili]] Trophy that the latter ought more clearly to explain Gaprindashvili's contributions to the game of chess (Gaprindashvili had been [[Women's World Chess Championship|World Champion]] for 17 years), but was barred by security. Azmaiparashvili and FIDE averred that Azmaiparashvili was detained and physically accosted despite his having properly and ''clearly [displayed] his [[Very Important Person (person)|VIP]] credentials'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20041204023615/http://www.fide.com/news.asp?id=584], whilst representatives of the Spanish chess federation ("Federación Española de Ajedrez") and tournament organizers blamed Azmaiparashvili for the incident, saying that he ''without any previous provocation, assaulted [an] agent with a head butt to [the] mouth'' [http://www.chesscenter.com/twic/event/calvia04/azmai.html].

===Drug testing===

Having been formally recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 1999, in preparation for prospective inclusion in future iterations of the [[Olympic Games]], FIDE implemented (in 2001) [[doping (sport)|doping]] restrictions consistent with those adopted by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA). Two players, [[Shaun Press]] of [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Bobby Miller (chess)|Bobby Miller]] of [[Bermuda]], refused, for various reasons, to submit urine samples for [[drug test|analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doping.nl/media/kb/2656/Miller_Panel.pdf Decision of the FIDE Doping Hearing Panel (Miller)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doping.nl/media/kb/2655/FIDE%202004_Shaun%20Press_Decision.pdf Decision of the FIDE Doping Hearing Panel (Press)]&lt;/ref&gt; Both players appeared before the FIDE Doping Hearing panel, which decided to cancel the players' performances (Press had scored 7½ points in 14 games, while Miller had scored 3½ points in 9 games), reducing the final score of Papua New Guinea to 15½ (from 23) and that of Bermuda to 18½ (from 22).

==Associated events==

Concomitant to the tournaments were several chess-related events planned by the organizing committee of the Olympiad, some under the auspices of FIDE; the events were known collectively as the ''First Chess Festival Calvià 2004''. Within the festival were held [[simultaneous exhibition]]s, game demonstrations and lectures by top Spanish players, and several secondary tournaments, including one for amateur players, a [[rapid chess]] event for players aged under 16, and one for senior players.

Chess classes were introduced into the [[primary school|primary]] and [[secondary school]]s, as well as [[Community centre|senior centers]], in and around Calvià in an effort to promote chess generally, and chess films were screened on the [[beach]]es of Calvià every weeknight during the Olympiad. Chess-oriented art was displayed at an ''International Chess Fair'', with prizes for top works awarded by a jury.

'''Bram Som''' (born 20 February 1980 in [[Terborg]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Running|runner]] who specializes in the [[800 metres]]. His personal best time of 1:43.45 minutes, achieved in August 2006 in [[Zürich]], is also the current Dutch National Record. He missed the 2005 season, but returned in 2006 to win the national Dutch championship for the fifth time since 2000. Later that year he won the European championship.

Som participated in the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] as well as the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. In 2000 he was eliminated in the first round as his time of 1:48.58 was not enough to advance. Four years later he would reach the semi finals in which he came fifth with a time of 1:45.52.

He is currently a 800m pacemaker, as of the [[2016 Diamond League]].&lt;ref&gt;http://monaco.diamondleague.com/en/programme_resultats_monaco_en/#baseFrame {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716191204/http://monaco.diamondleague.com/en/programme_resultats_monaco_en/ |date=2016-07-16 }}#/live/outputs/results/iaaf/atResults/js/mappings/discipline/disciplineRoot#DisciplineInit#Monaco2016_TIMING_ATMA08101_json##main-frame_content#/live/outputs/results/iaaf/atResults/js/mappings/discipline/run#RunSubFrame#Monaco2016_TIMING_ATMA08101_json&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brazil national cricket team''' represents the country of [[Brazil]] in [[international cricket]]. The team is organised by the [[Associação Brasileira de Cricket|Brazilian Cricket Association]] (''Cricket Brasil''), which became an affiliate member of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) in 2002 and an [[ICC members|associate member]] in 2017.&lt;ref name="Assoc"/&gt; However, the national side has a history dating back much longer, with its first recorded international match coming against [[Argentina national cricket team|Argentina]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/115/icc-members/associate-members/argentina Argentina] – International Cricket Council. Retrieved 4 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Regular international competition commenced in the 1920s, and resumed in the 1950s after a gap during World War II. Almost all of Brazil's matches have come against other South American sides, although in recent years the team has participated in several [[ICC Americas]] tournaments, which include sides from Central America and North America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Teams/2/2317/Other_Matches.html Other matches played by Brazil] – CricketArchive. Retrieved 4 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[South American Cricket Championship|South American Championships]], which commenced in 1995, Brazil has played in all but one edition, with a best finish of second at the 1997 tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/6/South_American_Championships_1997-98.html South American Championships 1997/98] – CricketArchive. Retrieved 4 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full [[Twenty20 International]] (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all [[Twenty20]] matches played between Brazil and other [[List of International Cricket Council members|ICC members]] after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/672322|title=All T20 matches between ICC members to get international status|work=[[International Cricket Council]]|date=26 April 2018|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Brazil]] became an [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] member in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Countries/42.html Country: Brazil] – CricketArchive. Retrieved 4 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Its ICC tournament debut came in 2006, when Brazil took part in Division Three of the [[ICC Americas Championship]] in Suriname. Although Brazil lost all three opening games in that tournament, no doubt due to lack of international exposure, its cricket has developed since then. 

Brazil won the 2009 [[ICC Americas Championship#Division Three|ICC Americas Championship Division Three]], winning all of its matches against [[Belize national cricket team|Belize]], [[Chile national cricket team|Chile]] and [[Peru national cricket team|Peru]]. This victory enabled Brazil to qualify for the 2010 [[ICC Americas Championship]] Division Two. 

However, Brazil seemingly struggled at this higher level, thus after losing all of their four matches, were relegated to Division Three.

At the [[South American Cricket Championship|South American Championship]], Brazil has participated in all but one edition since the tournament began in 1995, with its best finish being second at the 1997 event.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12231">{{About|time management in [[gridiron football]]|time management in other sorts|running out the clock}}

In [[gridiron football]], '''clock management''' is the manipulation of a game clock and [[play clock]] to achieve a desired result, typically near the end of a match. It is analogous to [[Running out the clock|"'''running out the clock"''']] (and associated counter-tactics) seen in many sports, and the act of trying to hasten the game's end is often referred to by this term. Clock managements [[American football strategy|strategies]] are a significant part of American football, where an elaborate set of rules dictates when the game clock stops between [[down (American football)|downs]], and when it continues to run.

==In American football==
===Rules for the game clock===
{{See also|Untimed play}}
Upon kickoff, the clock is started when a member of the receiving team touches the ball, or, if the member of the receiving team touches the ball in their end zone, carries the ball out of the end zone.  The clock is stopped when that player is tackled or goes out of bounds. (The clock never starts if the receiving team downs the ball in their own end zone for a [[touchback]].)  The clock is then restarted when the offense snaps the ball for their first play and continues to run unless one of the following occurs, in which case the clock is stopped at the end of the play and restarts at the next snap unless otherwise provided:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2016-nfl-rulebook/|title=2016 NFL Rulebook|date=|website=NFL Football Operations|at=Rule 4, Sections 3 &amp; 4.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A player carrying the ball goes out of bounds. Unless after the 2-minute warning of the first half or inside the last 5 minutes of the second half/overtime, the clock is restarted when the ball is spotted, unless another condition causes the clock to start at the snap.
*A loose ball is out of bounds. The clock is restarted when the ball is spotted, unless another condition causes the clock to start at the snap.
*A forward pass is ruled incomplete.
*Either team calls for a [[time-out (sport)|timeout]] or an official calls for a timeout, perhaps because a player is injured or there is a penalty on the play.  Officials will restart the clock after an official timeout, but not a team timeout, has concluded unless another of the conditions applies, or if the timeout is for a penalty enforcement after the 2-minute warning of the first half or inside the last 5 minutes of the second half/overtime (absent special timing rules for specific fouls).
**10 seconds will be taken off the clock, and the clock started when the ball is spotted, if the offense, after the 2-minute warning of either half, fouls or commits certain other acts that cause the clock to stop (including an injury when the offense is out of timeouts, except under certain circumstances), unless the clock will stop anyway for a different reason. In Canadian football, the offense may execute one additional [[untimed play]] if the clock expires while the ball is not in play.

*A score or touchback occurs. Additionally, the clock does not run during or after a [[Conversion (gridiron football)|conversion attempt]] in the NFL or NCAA college football.
*Possession of the football is transferred between teams for any reason.
*In [[college football]], the clock is briefly stopped when a team earns a [[down (football)|first down]] to allow the [[chain crew]] to reposition themselves. The [[NFL]] has no such stoppage.

If the clock runs out during a play, the current play is allowed to continue to its conclusion. If the clock runs out between downs, the period ends in American football, but in Canadian football the offense is allowed one last down.

Each team is given three timeouts per half which they can use to stop the clock from running after a play. In the NFL, teams get two timeouts in a preseason or regular season overtime period, or three in a postseason overtime half.

On a fair-catch punt, the clock starts at the snap and stops at the end of the play.

===Strategies===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}

==== Strategies for leading teams on offense ====
A team on offense that has the higher score seeks to use as much time as possible.  A drive that scores no points may nevertheless benefit the team by taking time off the clock. The team may:

*Favor run plays over pass plays.
*Use the center of the field rather than the sidelines to avoid going out of bounds and stopping the clock.
*Delay the start of each play until the [[play clock]] approaches 0.

The team may use counterintuitive game plans, such as declining to score or allowing the opponents to score, to accelerate the end of the game.

If the defense does not have enough time-outs to stop the clock before the ball is [[turnover on downs|turned over on downs]], the offense can [[running out the clock|run out the clock]] by executing repeated [[quarterback kneel]]s until the clock runs out. In the NFL and college football, up to 40 seconds can be taken off the clock between plays. The NFL also has a built-in [[two-minute warning]] that stops the clock after the play that occurs when the clock hits two minutes ends. In order to successfully run out the clock by kneeling, there must be less than 40 seconds on the clock if the opponent has two time-outs, 1 minute 20 seconds if the opponent has one time-out, or 2 minutes if the defense has no time-outs remaining, at the beginning of the series of downs. The offense can burn further time off the clock by [[timewasting]]: keeping the ball live (and the clock running) simply by keeping away from any defensive player, regardless of position on the field.

==== Strategies for trailing teams on offense ====
A team on offense that has the lower score seeks to conserve time.  The team may:
*Use a [[no-huddle offense]]; forgo detailed design of a play and instead signal and initiate a play quickly.
*Have the quarterback "spike" the ball, sacrificing a down to stop the clock. (An explicit exception is written into the American football rule books so that the move is not penalized for [[intentional grounding]].)
*Use a passing play (because an [[incomplete pass]] stops the clock) or a run play toward the sidelines (because taking the ball out of bounds also stops the clock).
** Most ideal after a 1st down.
*If a play ends such that the game clock continues running, use a [[Time-out (sport)#Gridiron football|timeout]].
*If the ball is still alive while the clock runs out and the team with the ball is still trailing, do everything within the team's power to keep the ball alive until it can be advanced to the end zone. Often this incorporates a series of [[lateral pass|lateral and backward passes]] to avoid the ball carrier being tackled and the game ending. 

A team that is tied or trailing by one or two points but is within the [[red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]] (and thus in easy [[field goal range]]) seeks to burn a specific amount of time off the clock, such that they can stop the clock with five or fewer seconds on the clock, so that their [[placekicker]] can kick a [[field goal (gridiron football)|field goal]] [[buzzer beater|with no time remaining]] and win the game.

==== Strategies for the defense ====
A team on defense has little control over the pace of the game.  It may expend its timeouts to ensure that there is adequate time left on the clock, in case the team regains possession. The defense can make decisions on how to stop the ball carrier based on whether the team is trailing or leading: if the offense is trying to conserve time, the defense can foil that by tackling the ball carrier in-bounds before they can get [[out of bounds]]. Defenses likewise can safely devote more personnel to the perimeter and leave the center of the field less defended, as an offense that cannot afford to keep the clock running will have to throw toward the sidelines.  Various rules ensure that the defense cannot [[Hack-a-Shaq|deliberately commit fouls to manipulate the game clock]], and in the most extreme such cases, an [[unfair act]] can be declared and the game [[forfeit (sport)|forfeited]] to the offense. (Likewise, if the offense commits fouls to burn off time and get extra downs, the clock is reset and [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] is called on them.)

== Canadian football ==
In [[Canadian football]], a team trailing by one point or tied has an additional option: a ball can be kicked from anywhere on the field in that sport, and balls kicked into or through the end zone and not returned score a [[single (football)|single point]]. This allows a team trailing by one to advance the ball upfield, then punt the ball toward the end zone in hopes of tying the game for one point (the player could also [[drop kick]] the ball, which would allow the kicking team to win on a [[field goal]] if kicked through the uprights). To prevent this scenario, defending teams will place their [[punter (football)|punter]] in the end zone to retrieve the ball and kick it back out of the end zone, preventing that single point from being scored.

Several of the strategies discussed above for American football above can be used in the Canadian code, however [[Comparison of American and Canadian football|rule differences]] mean that running out the clock much more difficult:

*Teams are allowed only three downs to advance the ball 10 yards without losing possession (as opposed to four in the American game).
*The offensive team has only 20 seconds after the ball is whistled into play to start a new play (as opposed to 25 seconds in American high school football and 40 seconds from the end of the last play in college football and the NFL).
*After the [[three-minute warning]] in Canadian football, two key timing changes occur:
**The clock stops after every play. The clock restarts when the referee whistles the ball in play after a tackle in bounds, and with the snap after an incomplete pass or a tackle out of bounds.
**A "time count" (the same foul as "delay of game" in American football), which is a 5-yard penalty (with the down repeated) at other points in the game, becomes a loss of down penalty on first or second down and a 10-yard penalty on third down. Additionally, if the referee deems a time count violation on third down in the last three minutes of a half to be deliberate, he can require the offensive team to legally place the ball in play within the 20-second count, with a violation resulting in loss of possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cflofficials.ca/docs/2015%20Rule%20Book%20English.pdf|title=Rule 1, Section 7, Article 9: Time Count|work=The Official Playing Rules for the Canadian Football League 2015|publisher=Canadian Football League|pages=18–19|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222133157/http://www.cflofficials.ca/docs/2015%20Rule%20Book%20English.pdf|archivedate=December 22, 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=December 21, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*If the clock hits 0:00 between plays, Canadian teams are required to execute one final play, even if the ball has not yet been snapped. In the American game, if the clock hits 0:00 between plays, the game is over unless the previous play ended in a defensive penalty, a score, or circumstances warranting various types of kicks.

These differences make for radically different endgames if the team with the lead has the ball. In the NFL, a team can run 120 seconds (2 minutes)--and slightly more in the NCAA--off the clock without gaining a first down (assuming that the defensive team is out of timeouts). In the Canadian game, just over 40 seconds can be run off.

Fankhouser began weight training while he was a student at [[West Liberty State College]] in [[West Liberty, West Virginia]].  He originally focused on playing fullback for the school’s football team and participating in the shot put, discus, hammer and javelin events for the track team, and then turned his focus to bodybuilding. He won his first competitive bodybuilding tournament, the 2004 NPC Upper Ohio Valley, placing first in the junior division. He won the Mr. West Virginia title in the 2005 Mid Atlantic Grand Prix/West Virginia States.&lt;ref name="westliberty.edu"&gt;[http://www.westliberty.edu/uploadedFiles/Faculty_and_Staff/College_Relations_and_Marketing/fall_07_online.pdf “Pro Bodybuilder is in the ‘House’ Top of the Hill Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first national competition, the 2006 North American Championship, he placed fourth in the heavyweight division. In 2007, he placed 16th in the USA Bodybuilding &amp; Figure Championships, but in his next competition he placed first in his class in the North American Championships. He was also named overall winner for the competition and earned his [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] pro card at that event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musculardevelopment.com/browse/index.php?mode=browse&amp;id=10016 Muscular Development Magazine (Online Edition)]&lt;/ref&gt; With his victory, Fankhouser made state sports history as the first West Virginia native to become a professional bodybuilder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtrf.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&amp;storyid=32573 “Man Making "Big" Strides in Career” WTRF-TV]&lt;/ref&gt; Erik placed 10th in his first IFBB pro contest, the Europa Super Show, in August 2008, winning both Pose Down Magazine's "Best Wheels" and the 4Ever Fit Fans' Choice awards during the contest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24218">The '''[[FIDE Women's Grand Prix]] 2011–12''' was a series of six [[chess]] tournaments exclusively for women, which formed part of the qualification cycle for the [[Women's World Chess Championship 2013]]. The winner of the Grand Prix, [[Hou Yifan]], will challenge the [[Women's World Chess Championship 2012|2012 Women's World Chess champion]].

==Format==
18 top world women players were to be selected to compete in these tournaments. Each player agrees and will contract to participate in exactly four of these tournaments. Players must rank their preference of tournaments once the final list of host cities is announced and the dates are allocated to each host city.

Each tournament is a 12-player, single [[round-robin tournament]]. In each round players scored 1 point for a win, ½ point for a [[draw (chess)|draw]] and 0 for a loss. Grand prix points were then allocated according to each player's standing in the tournament: '''160''' grand prix points for first place, 130 for second place, 110 for third place, and then 90 down to 10 points by steps of 10. In case of a tie in points the grand prix points are shared evenly by the tied players.
Players only counted their best three tournament results. The player with the most grand prix points is the winner.

==Players and qualification==
There were several ways to qualify for the Grand Prix series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011/12 Grand Prix regulations|url=http://grandprix.fide.com/regulations.html|publisher=FIDE|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grand Prix participants|url=http://grandprix.fide.com/women-participants.html|publisher=FIDE|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The top '''four''' from the [[Women's World Chess Championship 2010]]:
**[[Hou Yifan]], [[Ruan Lufei]], [[Koneru Humpy]], and [[Zhao Xue]].
*The winner of the [[FIDE Women's Grand Prix 2009–2011|previous Grand Prix]]
**(As Hou Yifan was already qualified an additional sixth rating entry was given)
*The '''six''' highest rated players (average of July 2010 and January 2011 lists) not already qualified:
**''[[Judit Polgár]]'' (declined), [[Tatiana Kosintseva]], [[Antoaneta Stefanova]], [[Nadezhda Kosintseva]], [[Anna Muzychuk]], and [[Kateryna Lahno]].
*'''Two''' players nominated by the FIDE president:
**[[Zhu Chen]] and [[Batkhuyag Munguntuul]].
*One nominee from each of the '''six''' host cities:
**[[Ekaterina Kovalevskaya]] (Rostov), [[Ju Wenjun]] (Shenzhen), [[Alexandra Kosteniuk]] (Nalchik), [[Alisa Galliamova]] (Kazan), [[Elina Danielian]] (Jermuk), and [[Betul Cemre Yildiz]] (Istanbul).

Polgár, the highest rated woman in the world, has never competed for the women's title and declined to participate in this cycle as well, so her spot was given to the next player on the average rating list, [[Viktorija Cmilyte]].

At the second tournament in Shenzhen, [[Tan Zhongyi]] replaced [[Alisa Galliamova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shenzhen Women's Grand Prix 2011 |url=http://www.chess.co.uk/twic/chessnews/events/shenzhen-womens-grand-prix-2011 |publisher=chess.co.uk |accessdate=14 September 2011 |date=13 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015041336/http://www.chess.co.uk/twic/chessnews/events/shenzhen-womens-grand-prix-2011 |archivedate=15 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Prize money and Grand Prix points==
The prize fund was €40,000 per Grand Prix event and €60,000 for the overall Grand Prix placement.&lt;ref name=regulations&gt;[http://grandprix.fide.com/regulations.html: Regulations for the 2011–2012 Women's FIDE Grand-Prix]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tie breaks==
With the objective of determining a clear, single winner to play in the Challenger Match and in the case that two or more players have equal cumulative points at the top, the following criteria (in descending order) will be utilized to decide the overall winner:
# The fourth result not already in the top three performances
# The number of actual game points scored in the four tournaments
# The number of first-place finishes
# The number of second-place finishes
# The number of won games
# Drawing of lots

Hou Yifan won the Grand Prix with a perfect score culminating with her third sole victory at the fifth Grand Prix in Jermuk and thus qualified her to face [[Anna Ushenina]] in the [[Women's World Chess Championship 2013]]. A score in ''italics'' denotes a score not being into account for the total as there are three better results for the player.

The {{nihongo|'''Fukuoka Red Warblers'''|福岡レッドワーブラーズ}} were a [[baseball]] team in the [[Shikoku-Kyūshū Island League]] of [[Japan]]. The team was established as part of the expansion of the league (along with the [[Nagasaki Saints]]). They started league play during the {{by|2008}} season, lasting through the 2009 season.

The team's home was [[Fukuoka Prefecture]]. Its name combined the color of the prefecture's symbol flower, the ''[[ume]]'', and the prefectural bird, the [[Japanese bush-warbler]].

'''''Hockey Homicide''''' is a [[cartoon]] made by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] in 1945.

==Synopsis==

Narrator [[Doodles Weaver]] explains the rules of [[ice hockey]] in satirical format.  The narration's emphasis on good sportsmanship is countered by the violence of the players (all of them "played" by [[Goofy]]). Team captains Ice Box Bertino and Fearless Ferguson are rivals who brutally fight each other and incur a penalty before the game can begin, sending both of them to the penalty box; subsequently, they are constantly released from the box only to be sent back to it as they cannot help but fight each other on the ice. Eventually, confusion over many extra hockey pucks leads the players and spectators to get into a massive brawl, during which snippets from other Disney cartoons (including ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', ''[[How to Play Football]]'', ''[[How to Play Baseball]]'', and ''[[Victory Through Air Power (film)|Victory Through Air Power]]'') are included to emphasize the mass confusion. Meanwhile, the Loose Leafs' and the Ant Eaters' team members excitedly and intently watch the action from high in the stands while enjoying themselves, with the closing narration implying that they irritate each other's fans into fighting so the players themselves can watch instead.

==Production notes==
* The names of all the players are named after various members of the Disney staff. The list below is from the scorecard early in the short.

A '''kugel fountain''' (also called a '''"floating" sphere fountain''' or by the [[pleonasm|pleonasmic]] name '''kugel ball''') is a [[water feature]] or sculpture where a [[sphere]] sits in a [[ball joint|fitted hollow]] in a pedestal, and is supported by [[aquaplaning]] on a thin film of water. Pressurized water flows between the sphere and socket, creating a mechanical [[fluid bearing]] that is nearly frictionless. The sphere can weigh thousands of [[pound (mass)|pound]]s, but the efficient bearing allows it to be spun by the force of a hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Physics of the granite sphere fountain|work=American Journal of Physics|first1=Jacco H.|last1=Snoeijer|first2=Ko|last2=van der Weele|volume=82|issue=11|pages=1029–39|date=November 2014|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aapt/journal/ajp/82/11/10.1119/1.4886365|doi=10.1119/1.4886365}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sphere does not float, being [[density|denser]] than water; it is often made from [[granite]].&lt;ref name=physics&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snoeijer |first1=Jacco H. |last2=der Weele |first2=Ko van |title=Physics of the granite sphere fountain |journal=American Journal of Physics |date=November 2014 |volume=82 |issue=11 |pages=1029–1039 |doi=10.1119/1.4886365 |url=http://stilton.tnw.utwente.nl/people/snoeijer/Papers/2014/SnoeijerAJP14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hydraulics of the fountain can be controlled so that the [[axis of rotation]] of the sphere changes continually.&lt;ref name=Kusser&gt;{{cite web |title=Floating Sphere (Kugel ball fountain) from the market leader {{!}} KusserUSA |url=http://www.kusserusa.com/floating-spheres-rings-discs-wheels.html |website=www.kusserusa.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ring sculptures that rotate on an [[Axis of rotation|axis]] are also built.&lt;ref name=Kusser/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://floatingspherefountain.com/stone-ring-fountain |title= Ring water feature |work= Brahma Granitech, India |accessdate= 21 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kugel fountains can be found all over the world. Many are at popular tourist destinations, such as science museums&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Oaks, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926213334/http://www.richmond.com/museums/output.aspx?Article_ID=3195201&amp;Vertical_ID=155&amp;tier=20&amp;position=6 Richmond in the Record Books], Richmond.com, 18 August, [2004], Retrieved on 18 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; shopping centers, lobbies, and gardens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6159">{{Other uses|Mat (disambiguation)}}
'''Mats''' are used for safety in [[gymnastics]], and in training new skills. They are usually a piece of foam (covered in leather) ranging from 1.5-28&amp;nbsp;inches thick, covered in a vinyl or plastic lining. The foam ranges in density from relatively firm to very soft.

Landing mats are usually blue, but can also be almost any other color. Mats come in a range of sizes, from very small mats used on the beam, to very large mats, used in the foam pits.

Typically, in both competition and practice, the use of mats is mandatory. On every event except [[floor exercise]], [[pommel horse]] and [[Vault (gymnastics)|vault]], gymnasts may use an additional landing mat, without deduction, which may be adjusted for distance.

==Types==

=== Beam pads ===
[[File:Beam safety wrap.jpg|thumb|alt=Gymnastics coach fastening a foam wrap to the balance beam.|This ''[[gymnastics]]'' coach is fastening a foam beam wrap to the ''[[balance beam]]''.]]
These are thin mats that fasten around the [[balance beam]]. They are used only in training to give gymnasts training high-level skills additional protection and a wider landing space while working on the apparatus. Makeshift beam pads can also be constructed from soft mats placed over the beam surface, if necessary.

=== Blocks ===
Blocks are firm, [[trapezoid]] or rectangular shaped mats. They can be attached to other blocks via [[velcro]] and straps. Blocks are routinely used as step-stools for gymnasts working on the bars or beam and as practice vaulting surfaces.

=== Crash mats ===
Typically, these mats are extremely thick and soft, and are used when an athlete is learning a new, high-impact skill.

=== Folding panel mats ===

These mats are thin, firm mats about twelve feet in length. They usually have alternating color panels and can be folded, stacked and attached to other mats via velcro strips at the ends. Normally used for practicing tumbling moves, these mats may be stacked to provide a protective surface for gymnasts working on the low [[balance beam]], or provide a means for a gymnast to reach the bars or rings. They have a history of usage in gymnastics, martial arts and physical education classes. Schools generally purchase new folding mats once every 7 years. These mats are perfect for providing a level of protection for the body from high impact collisions with hard solid surfaces such as hardwood or concrete flooring. There are two main categories of foam used in these types of mats, [[cross-linked polyethylene]] foam and [[polyurethane]] foam.

==== Foam core ====

===== Polyethylene foam =====
[[Cross-linked polyethylene]] foam is a very solid and sturdy foam, when being used in a folding panel gym mat—it is generally accepted to be at a standard of 1 3/8" thickness. Mats with this type of foam would be considered for professional use in sporting events.

===== Polyurethane foam =====
The foam is firm, but not as firm as the cross-linked polyethylene foam used in 1 3/8" thick models. Because of the lack of firmness mats made with this type of foam generally use specifically 2" thick 100 ILD open cell 4.5&amp;nbsp;lb. density [[polyurethane]] foam. Generally accepted uses of mats with this kind of foam are practice venues, home use, and youth amateur sports events.

==== Vinyls ====
Each mat although maybe of different foam generally have similar vinyl enclosures. 14 to 18&amp;nbsp;ounce polyester laminated vinyl is generally used in all folding mat applications. The vinyl covers should be fire-retardant (class - A), puncture and mildew resistant and have antibacterial properties to help maintain good hygiene. Velcro on each end of the mat allows a near seamless connection to additional mats for tumbling runs or expansive areas.

==== Sizes ====
Ranging from 4 feet x 8 feet to 6 feet x 12 feet, sizes usually only matter when limited by space or personal preference. In most cases – like in gymnastics – multiple mats are purchased to be strung together via Velcro to create the ultimate [[sure-footed]] tumbling experience. Generally mats used for gymnasiums and gymnastics mats come in 2-foot-wide panels and is why many in the industry call them folding panel mats or folding mats. The 2-foot-wide panels allow for ease in both set up and clean up when using the mats to becoming the perfect compact size for storage.

=== Incline mats ===
[[File:Incline handstand.jpg|thumb|alt=Gymnast performing handstand on a folding incline.|This ''[[Gymnast]]'' performs a ''[[Handstand]] on a folding incline.]]
Also known as wedge mats, cheese mats or simply "the cheese," are firm mats shaped like [[right triangle]]s. They are mainly used to teach and train beginning and intermediate gymnastics skills such as [[roll (gymnastics)|rolls]], walkovers and handsprings.

=== Springboard mats ===
These firm mats are used on [[Vault (gymnastics)|vault]]. They are U-shaped and surround the springboard on three sides. In the event that the gymnast's foot misses the springboard during his or her vault attempt, he or she can push off the mat for momentum and, hopefully, avoid a serious injury. Under the current ''[[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|Code of Points]]'', performing a [[Yurchenko (vault)|Yurchenko]]-style vault without the safety mat results in an automatic score of zero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fig-gymnastics.com/publicdir/rules/files/wag/WAG%20CoP%202013-2016%20June%202015-E.pdf ''Code of Points''] at the official website of the International Federation of Gymnastics (FIG):Section 10.4.3, "Performance of Invalid Vaults", page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Landing mats ===
These mats are thin and soft, and are usually white or red in color to distinguish them from the other mats and floor exercise area. They are used on the [[floor exercise]] to lessen the "sting," or impact, of tumbling run landings and for dismounts on the beam or floor. Sting mats are routinely used in training, but are only rarely used or permitted in competition.

==Plot==
The [[University of Minnesota]] [[ice hockey]] head coach [[Herb Brooks]] ([[Kurt Russell]]) interviews with the [[United States Olympic Committee]] for the national team coach's job, discussing his philosophy on how to beat the Soviet team, calling for changes to the practice schedule and strategy. Brooks meets his assistant coach [[Craig Patrick]] ([[Noah Emmerich]]) at the tryouts in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. Brooks selects a preliminary roster of 26, indifferent to the preferences of senior USOC hockey officials. He convinces [[Walter Bush]] ([[Sean McCann (actor)|Sean McCann]]), the executive director of the committee, that he has their best interests at heart. Bush reluctantly agrees to take the heat from the committee for Brooks' decisions.

During the initial practice, tempers flare as forward [[Rob McClanahan]] and defenseman [[Jack O'Callahan]] get into a fight based on college rivalry. Brooks bluntly tells the players that they are to let go of old rivalries and start becoming a team. As practices continue, Brooks uses unorthodox methods to winnow the roster down to 20 players. The players themselves worry about being cut at any time, knowing that Brooks himself was the last player cut from the [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Olympic hockey team]] that won the gold medal, so he will do anything to win. 

During an exhibition game against [[Norway national ice hockey team|Norway]] in [[Oslo]] that ends in a 3–3 tie, Brooks notices the players are distracted and not playing up to their potential. After the game, he orders them back on the ice to skate "Herbies", which they do for an extended period of time even after the rink manager turns off the power. Exhausted, forward [[Mike Eruzione]] interrupts Brooks and cries out that he plays for the United States. Getting the answer he wanted all along, Brooks finally tells the players they are done. Eventually, the team comes together, with the players thinking of themselves as a family representing the United States. The team plays the Soviets in an exhibition game at [[Madison Square Garden]]. The Soviets manhandle the young American team, winning by a score of 10–3. During the game, O'Callahan receives an injury that could keep him out of the entire Olympics, and starting goaltender [[Jim Craig (ice hockey)|Jim Craig]] is told he may be benched in favor of back-up goalie [[Steve Janaszak]]. Craig ends up retaining his starting job when the coach brings him to realize that he hasn't been giving his very best.
 
As the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] begins, the Americans trail [[Sweden]] 2–1 in the first game. Brooks fires up the team during the break by accusing an injured McClanahan of quitting. McClanahan ends up playing despite his injury, which inspires the team and [[Bill Baker (hockey player)|Bill Baker]] scores a goal with less than a minute remaining in the third period for a dramatic 2–2 tie. They then follow up with a 7–3 win over heavily favored [[Czechoslovakia]]. As the Olympics continue, the team defeats Norway, [[Romania]], and [[West Germany]] to earn a spot in the medal round. The Americans are considered overwhelming underdogs to the Soviets in the first medal round game. The game begins and the Soviets score the first goal. Then O'Callahan, having healed enough from his injury, enters the game for the first time. He makes an immediate impact by heavily checking [[Vladimir Krutov]] on a play that leads to a goal by [[Buzz Schneider]]. The Soviets score again to retake the lead, but in the final seconds the Soviet goalie [[Vladislav Tretiak]] stops a long shot by [[Dave Christian]], but [[Mark Johnson (hockey player)|Mark Johnson]] gets the rebound and scores with less than one second left in the period.
	
During the first intermission the Soviet coach replaces Tretiak with backup [[Vladimir Myshkin]]. In the second period the Soviets score a goal to go up 3–2. Early in the final period the Soviet team is called for a penalty, giving the Americans [[Power play (sporting term)|a man advantage]]. Johnson scores his second goal of the game just as the penalty is about to expire. Later, Eruzione puts them ahead 4–3 with 10 minutes left. The Americans hold off the Soviets to win the game, completing one of the biggest upsets in sports history. Two days later the team would go on to defeat [[Finland]] 4–2 to win the gold medal. The movie ends with Brooks staring out over his team with pride as the entire team crowds together on the gold medal platform.

==Production==
[[Gavin O'Connor (director)|Gavin O'Connor]] directed and [[Mark Ciardi]] produced the movie.  Both are drawn to inspirational stories and they decided to take on the "Greatest Sports Moment of the 20th Century".&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, Brian (January 7, 2000). [http://www.bu.edu/bridge/archive/2000/01-07/features6.html "1980 ''Miracle on Ice'' named Greatest Sports Moment of the Century"]. ''B.U. Bridge'', vol. 3 no. 18. Retrieved October 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; They chose to focus on the determination and focus of coach Herb Brooks. O'Connor knew from the beginning that he wanted to cast Kurt Russell as Herb Brooks because he needed someone with an athletic background and a fiery passion for sports. The casting of the team consisted of real hockey players to give the film a raw and accurate feel. O'Connor figured it would be easier to teach hockey players to act than to teach actors to play hockey. On-ice tryouts were held in New York, Boston, Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Toronto, and Vancouver. Another tryout was held in Vancouver for the Soviet and European teams.

There are a total of 133 different hockey plays in the film. To accomplish this, the directors turned to ReelSports Solutions, who had helped with the producers on a previous movie, ''[[The Rookie (2002 film)|The Rookie]]''. The ReelSports team referred to coach Herb Brooks for information on practices, plays, equipment, and uniform styles. Each fight and stunt scene was choreographed to ensure the actors' safety. Players went through a six-week training camp to relearn the game in older equipment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hollywoodjesus.com/miracle_about.htm "''Miracle'' (2004) – About the Production"]. (January 30, 2004). HollywoodJesus.com. Retrieved October 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coach Brooks died in a car accident shortly after the film's principal photography was completed. The movie is dedicated to Brooks's memory. The dedication states at the end of the film, "He never saw it. He lived it."

=== Historical inaccuracy ===
The film states that [[Vladislav Tretiak]] was [[Viktor Tikhonov (ice hockey, born 1930)|Viktor Tikhonov]]'s "[[wikt:bread and butter|bread and butter]]" after being pulled from the net at the start of the second period of the game in the Olympics.  The fact is that Tikhonov was not named head coach until 1977 and Tretiak was one from the old guard.

'''Palace of Sports''' or '''Sports Palace''' ({{lang-ru|Дворец спорта}}) is the name of comprehensive indoors [[sports venue]]s introduced in the [[Soviet Union]] (compare with [[Palace of Culture]]) and still used in a number of [[post-Soviet states]]. Many of them had standard architectural design. Some of them were renamed, e.g., into '''Palace of Concerts and Sports'''.

The term is also used in other countries. For example, in [[Hispanophone]] countries, the term is '''Palacio de los Deportes'''.

[[Image:Gymnasta.jpg|thumb|right|A handstand]]

'''Parallel bars''' are a floor apparatus consisting of two wooden bars slightly over {{convert|11|ft|cm}} long and positioned at roughly hand height. Parallel bars are used in [[artistic gymnastics]] and also for [[physical therapy]] and [[exercise|home exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mademan.com/mm/parallel-bar-exercises-physical-therapy.html |title=Parallel Bar Exercises For Physical Therapy |last=Potts |first=Jennifer |date=March 21, 2011 |website=Mademan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gymnasts may optionally wear [[grip (gymnastics)|grip]]s when performing a routine on the parallel bars, although this is uncommon.

== Apparatus ==
The apparatus consists of two [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] bars that are held parallel to, and elevated above, the floor by a [[metal]] supporting framework. The bars are composed of [[wood]] or other material, with an outer coating of wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Apparatus Norms |url=http://www.unorp.br/downloads_blogs/Nomenclatura_dos_aparelhos.pdf |publisher=[[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]] |page=II/27 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vertical members of the supporting framework are adjustable so the height of the bars above the floor and distance between the bars can be set optimally for each gymnast.&lt;ref name=dimensions&gt;{{cite web |title= Apparatus Norms |url=http://www.unorp.br/downloads_blogs/Nomenclatura_dos_aparelhos.pdf |publisher=[[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]] |page=II/28 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dimensions ===
*Bar length: {{convert|350|cm|ft}} ± {{convert|1|cm|in}}&lt;ref name=dimensions /&gt;
*Bar rounded profile: {{convert|5|cm|in}} ± {{convert|1|mm|in}} vertical by {{convert|4|cm|in}} ± {{convert|1|mm|in}} horizontal &lt;ref name=dimensions /&gt;
*Bar width: {{convert|4|cm|in}} ± {{convert|1|mm|in}}&lt;ref name=dimensions /&gt;
*Height of bar from floor: {{convert|200|cm|ft}} ± {{convert|1|cm|in}}&lt;ref name=dimensions /&gt;
*Distance between bars:  {{convert|42|cm|in}} - {{convert|52|cm|in}} (adjustable)&lt;ref name=dimensions /&gt;

==History==
The parallel bars (in German ''Barren'') were invented by [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gymmedia.com/ghent2001/appa/bars/history_ba.htm History of bars]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1819 the first transportable parallel bars were described. In 1856 in Germany Hermann Otto Kluge used tubes to make the parallel bars and the horizontal bar adjustable. He used them in his gym. In Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, published between 1873-1877, their use for exercise is described.

== Routines ==
A routine performed on the parallel bars must include various elements that depend on the gymnast's competitive level. A typical performance will involve swinging skills in a support position (on the hands), a hanging position, and an upper arm position (resting on the inner bicep). Also, parallel bar routines often feature a strength or static hold skill such as an L-sit or handstand. Each routine ends with a dismount from either the ends of the bars or the side of the apparatus.

=== International level routines ===
A parallel bar routine should contain at least one element from all element groups:&lt;ref name=groups&gt;{{cite web |title=MAG Code of Points 2009-2012 |url=http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1205 |publisher=[[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]] |page=100 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001002145/http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1205 |archivedate=2009-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* I. Elements in support or through support
* II. Elements starting in upper arm position
* III. Long swings in hang, on 1 or 2 rails
* IV. Underswings
* V. Dismounts

=== Scoring and rules ===
Deductions are taken for form and exactness of elements performed.  There are specific deductions for adjusting hand position in handstand and not controlling swing elements;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MAG Code of Points 2009-2012 |url=http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1205 |publisher=[[Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique|FIG]] |page=101 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001002145/http://figdocs.lx2.sportcentric.com/external/serve.php?document=1205 |archivedate=2009-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; swing type elements should momentarily show handstand.&lt;ref name=groups /&gt;

{{coord|51|53|36|N|02|04|12|W|display=title}}
'''Sandford Parks Lido''' is one of the largest outdoor [[swimming pool]]s in the UK, set in landscaped gardens in [[Cheltenham]], [[England]]. The [[Lido (swimming pool)|Lido]] consists of a 50-metre main pool (with reserved lanes), a children's pool, and paddling pool.  All the pools are heated to over {{convert|70|°F|°C}}.

{{cquote|''Historic outdoor pools are like gold dust and Sandford Parks Lido is a real gem. Whether you're cooling off in the summer sun, taking the kids for their first swimming lessons or just enjoying the history of the site, the restored [[Lido]] will benefit everyone in and around [[Cheltenham]]''. &amp;mdash; Nerys Watts, [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] Manager in the South West, 2006.}}

On 1 April 1996 a [[charitable trust]], Sandford Lido Limited, took over operational control of Sandford Parks Lido signing a 25-year lease with Cheltenham Borough Council and is open to the general public from May to the end of September each year.

==History==

Sandford Parks Lido was opened on 25 May 1935, the ceremony started at 3pm with a procession of open-top motor cars travelling from the Municipal Offices to the Lido, carrying the Mayor of Cheltenham and his wife, along with dignitaries from neighbouring cities and towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Enterprise At The Resorts; Added Amenities, Inland And Seaside Attractions |date=Apr 17, 1935 |page=11 |newspaper=[http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/keywordsearch.arc?queryKeywords=Enterprise+At+The+Resorts The Times] |ref=CS184757393 |quote=The popularity of Cheltenham should be strengthened by the opening next month of an open-air swimming pool in Sandford Park, built by the corporation at a cost of £14,000. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heating of the pool was a unique feature and one of the first tasks of the staff was to stoke the coal fire boiler. As many Lidos in the country remain unheated, first-time visitors to Sandford Parks Lido are often surprised that the pool water is heated.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

After the opening of the indoor swimming facilities in Cheltenham the future of the Lido came into question. There were times when the Lido would break even or show a slight surplus, however after a poor summer in 1982 the Lido faced the first calls to close or to sell the site. Lido friends rallied round, a public petition was organised and the Lido was protected for the next few years. 

By the early 1990s the Lido was under considerable threat again. Cheltenham Borough Council had carried out a feasibility study of the complex including a radar survey of both pools. The radar survey confirmed that both pools were on unstable ground and the repairs had failed. Structurally they gave the main pool a life expectancy of only ten years.

In negotiation with Cheltenham Borough Council a way forward was developed and by 1996 a charitable Trust had been formed with members of the Friends of the Lido. On 1 April 1996 the trust took over operational control

The Charity has invested over £370,000 on refurbishment and site improvements since taking control and by 2005, £250,000 had been raised from direct donations. Together with £50,000 from Gloucestershire Environmental Trust with Landfill Tax contributions from Cory Environmental Ltd and a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of £382,500, work was able to commence in September 2006 on the main pool refurbishment project.&lt;ref name=BBC20060627 &gt;{{cite news |title=Lottery cash boost for town lido |date=27 Jun 2006 |newspaper=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/5121560.stm |quote=The Heritage Lottery Fund gives a £382,000 grant to Cheltenham's Sandford Parks Lido.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The refurbishment project will stabilise the main pool structure and refresh the pool deck and promenade paving.  Work was expected to be completed in May, ready for the 2007 summer season but the reopening eventually was confirmed as 11 August 2007.

Following the [[2007 United Kingdom floods]] the opening of the pool was further delayed pending confirmation from Severn Trent Water authority that the water supply was clean enough to be used. The pool was finally opened on Wednesday 15 August 2007.

14 April 2011 Sandford Parks Lido won the Cheltenham Civic Awards for the restoration works.
"The judges were impressed with the attention to the restoration of the detail of this important heritage facility within Cheltenham...Its exemplary status within English Heritage is testament to the value of the restoration work."

The '''Santiago Bernabéu Stadium''' ({{lang-es|Estadio Santiago Bernabéu}} {{IPA-es|esˈtaðjo sanˈtjaɣo βeɾnaˈβeu̯|}}) is a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Madrid]], Spain. With a current seating capacity of 81,044, it has been the home stadium of [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] since its completion in 1947.&lt;ref name="Official capacity"/&gt;

The Santiago Bernabéu is one of the world's most famous football venues. It has hosted the final of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup/UEFA Champions League]] on four occasions: in [[1957 European Cup Final|1957]], [[1969 European Cup Final|1969]], [[1980 European Cup Final|1980]] and [[2010 UEFA Champions League Final|2010]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind=64/newsid=676743.html |title=Madrid and Hamburg awarded 2010 finals |publisher=UEFA |date=28 March 2008 |accessdate=28 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331135339/http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind%3D64/newsid%3D676743.html |archivedate=31 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and will be the host of the 2018 [[2018 Copa Libertadores Finals|Copa Libertadores Final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Final de la CONMEBOL Libertadores 2018 se jugará el domingo 9 de diciembre en el Santiago Bernabéu de Madrid |url=http://www.conmebol.com/es/final-de-la-conmebol-libertadores-2018-se-jugara-el-domingo-9-de-diciembre-en-el-santiago-bernabeu |website=conmebol |accessdate=30 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final matches for the [[1964 European Nations' Cup]] and the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]], were also held at the Bernabéu, making it the first stadium in Europe to host both a [[UEFA European Championship]], a [[FIFA World Cup]] final and a [[Copa Libertadores]] final.

On 22 June 1944, the Banco Mercantil e Industrial bank granted a credit to [[Santiago Bernabéu Yeste|Santiago Bernabéu]] and Rafael Salgado for the purchase of the land adjacent to the old [[Ramin Amin]]. On 5 September 1944, architects Manuel Muñoz Monasterio and Luis Alemany Soler were hired and the structure on the site began to give way to the new stadium. On 27 October 1944, construction work on the stadium began.

The {{lang|es|Nuevo Estadio Chamartín}} ({{lang-en|New Chamartín Stadium}}) was inaugurated on 14 December 1947 with a match between Real Madrid and the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] side [[C.F. Os Belenenses|Os Belenenses]], which resulted in a 3–1 victory for ''Los Blancos''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1193040487651/1330073124892/noticia/Noticia/Real_Madrid_to_play_1,500th_official_clash_at_the_Santiago_Bernabeu.htm?w=2 "Real Madrid to play 1,500th official clash at the Santiago Bernabéu"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Real Madrid.com. Retrieved 22 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The stadium had an initial capacity of 75,145 spectators, 27,645 of which had seats (7,125 covered) and 47,500 for standing fans. [[Sabino Barinaga]] was the first player to score in the new stadium.

===The 1950s===
The first major renovation occurred in 1955. On 19 June of that year, the stadium expanded to accommodate 125,000 spectators. Thus, the Madrid coliseum became the biggest stadium of all the participants of the newly established [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]].

On 4 January 1955, after the General Assembly of Members Compromisaros, it was decided that the stadium adopt its present name in honour of club President Santiago Bernabéu.

In May 1957, Real Madrid used electric stadium lighting in a game against [[Sport Club do Recife|Sport Recife]] of [[Brazil]].

===The 1980s===
The next big changes did not occur until the early 1980s with the hosting of the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] in Spain. The stadium had to adapt to the changing times and with this, architects Rafael Luis Alemany and Manuel Salinas were hired for the stadium's renovation project. The brothers were sons of Luis Alemany Soler, who carried out the original construction project next to Muñoz Monasterio. The work lasted 16 months and had a cost of 704&amp;nbsp;million [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]] (US $4.7&amp;nbsp;million), of which 530&amp;nbsp;million was paid by the City of Madrid.

The improvements included a number of points. First, [[FIFA]] forced two-thirds of the seating area to be covered. For this reason, Real Madrid installed a roof covering the perimeter of the first and second tiers of seating, except the east side. The stadium's capacity was reduced from 120,000 to 98,000 spectators, 24,550 of which were covered by the new roof. The project also involved remodeling the façade, the installation of new electronic signs in the north and south ends, as well as the renovation of the press areas, lockers rooms, access, and ancillary areas.

The stadium hosted four matches in the World Cup: three second-round Group Two matches ([[West Germany national football team|West Germany]] vs. [[England national football team|England]], West Germany vs. [[Spain national football team|Spain]], and Spain vs. England) and the prestigious [[1982 FIFA World Cup Final|final match]] (Italy vs. West Germany).

===The 1990s===
Following a series of spectator fatalities in the 1980s (most notably the [[Heysel Stadium disaster|Heysel Stadium in Belgium]] and the [[Hillsborough disaster|Hillsborough Stadium in England]]), English authorities released the [[Taylor Report]] on how to improve football spectator safety in English venues. [[UEFA]] followed suit across Europe. The stadium was forced to create separate shortcuts to different stadium sections and seats for all spectators. In the 1990s, the Santiago Bernabéu went through a large expansion and remodeling. The board of [[Ramón Mendoza]] awarded the project to Gines Navarro Construcciones, S.A. The work started on 7 February 1992 and concluded on 7 May 1994 with a final cost of more than 5&amp;nbsp;billion pesetas, substantially raising the debt of the club, having no institutional support.

The work concluded with the creation of an amphitheater on the west side and in the foundations, coupled with the existing building by using hydraulic jacks.

In total, 20,200 upgraded seats were installed, with each seat having a tilt of 87 degrees, ensuring a perfect view and proximity to the pitch. In addition, to access the new ring, four entrance towers were erected on the outside, each with two staircases and a central spiral ramp.

With the new structure, the height of the stadium was increased from 22&amp;nbsp;m to 45&amp;nbsp;m. This caused problems during the winter, leaving two-thirds of the field of play in the shade. This lack of sunlight led to grass deterioration on the pitch. For this reason, a polypropylene pipe network was installed at a 20&amp;nbsp;cm depth under the pitch. At over 30&amp;nbsp;km long the pipe system circulates hot water, keeping the turf from freezing in cold temperatures.

Also, due to the height of the stand, it was necessary to improve and increase the lighting capability. A retractable protective roof was also installed to protect the fans from the elements. After the renovation, the stadium's capacity was 110,000 spectators.

Already in the summer of 1998, and chaired by [[Lorenzo Sanz]], the Santiago Bernabéu adopted an all-seating arrangement, bringing its capacity down to 75,328 spectators.

===2000s===
As the club kept growing in all regards&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/fourfourtwos-100-best-football-stadiums-world-no8#:WQfSK2H5Z6YKdA FourFourTwo's 100 Best Football Stadiums in the World. No.8: Santiago Bernabéu]. FourFourTwo.com. 13 November 2015. Retrieved 9 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;, thoughts for further changes to the stadium appeared. When [[Florentino Pérez]] became the president of the club, he launched a "master plan" with one goal: to improve the comfort of the Santiago Bernabéu and the quality of its facilities, and maximise revenue for the stadium.

Pérez invested [[Euro|€]]127&amp;nbsp;million in five years (2001–2006) by adding an expansion to the east side of the stadium, as well adding a new façade on Father Damien street, new costumes, new boxes and VIP areas, a new stage in honour of the east side, a new press area (also located on the east side), a new audio system, new bars, integration of heating in the stands, panoramic lifts, new restaurants, escalators in the tower access, and implementation of the multipurpose building in Father Damien street. Following the enlargement of the lateral east side and the creation of new galleries, the capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu was 80,354, all seated.

In 2007, the 1,000th match was played at the Santiago Bernabéu. In addition, the latest revision of UEFA on 27, on the occasion of Champions League match against [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], served as a final step to give the Santiago Bernabéu elite stadium status on 14 November 2007, a month before the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the inauguration of the stadium. UEFA announced that the club will officially rename the [[UEFA stadium categories|elite stadium]].

Pérez proposed construction of a retractable roof before he resigned in 2005. In 2009, following the re-election of Pérez as the club president, it was announced that the roof construction was looking unlikely due to the financial situation of the club. According to Spanish sports newspaper ''[[Diario Marca|Marca]]'', however, Pérez wants to restructure Santiago Bernabéu. According to the newspaper, the architect in charge will be chosen from among a shortlist of Spanish architects [[Santiago Calatrava]] and [[Pritzker Prize]]-winner [[Rafael Moneo]], and Chinese-American [[Ieoh Ming Pei]], also a [[Pritzker Prize|Pritzker]] winner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://es.eurosport.yahoo.com/11092009/47/liga-nuevo-bernabeu-galactico.html (in Spanish) Un nuevo Bernabeú galáctico]. Yahoo! EuroSport, 11 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010s===
According to the official website of the club, the current capacity is 81,044.&lt;ref name="Official capacity"/&gt;

On 16 October 2013, Pérez announced that Real Madrid was seeking to sell the naming rights for its stadium and looking for [[Sponsor (commercial)|a sponsor]] for the €400&amp;nbsp;million renovation project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-ke/news/4631/soccerex/2013/10/16/4337107/real-madrid-working-on-bernabeu-naming-rights-partner-perez |title=Real Madrid "working on" Bernabeu naming rights partner – Perez |date=16 October 2013 |accessdate=24 October 2013 |publisher=goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed design of the stadium renovation, produced by German architects [[Gerkan, Marg and Partners|GMP]], was unveiled on 31 January 2014. The bold design includes a retractable roof, with the overall cost of around €400&amp;nbsp;million likely to be met half via the sale of naming rights and half via a bond issue to Real members according to Spanish media reports. Pérez said, "We want to make the Santiago Bernabéu the best stadium in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Real Madrid reveal £330m design for new Bernabeu stadium|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25978150|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2014/10/27/sport/football/football-santiago-bernabeu-real-madrid/|title = Estadio Santiago Bernabeu: The $500m stadium wrapped in a glowing 'skin'|date = 28 October 2014|accessdate = 6 March 2015|website = CNN|publisher = |last = Edwards|first = Piers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real Madrid then announced a sponsorship agreement with [[International Petroleum Investment Company|IPIC]] to assist the club in the redevelopment of the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.laprensasa.com/309_america-in-english/2769744_real-madrid-and-ipic-sign-agreement-to-renovate-bernabeu-stadium.html|title = Real Madrid and IPIC sign agreement to renovate Bernabeu stadium|date = 28 October 2014|accessdate = 6 March 2015|website = La Prensa|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402125841/http://www.laprensasa.com/309_america-in-english/2769744_real-madrid-and-ipic-sign-agreement-to-renovate-bernabeu-stadium.html|archivedate = 2 April 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-28/real-madrid-gets-stadium-financing-from-abu-dhabi-s-ipic|title = Real Madrid Gets Stadium Financing From Abu Dhabi's IPIC|date = 28 October 2014|accessdate = 7 March 2015|website = Bloomberg|publisher = |last = Duff|first = Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.marca.com/en/2014/10/25/en/football/real_madrid/1414236689.html|title = Bernabéu sheikh-up: Abu Dhabi coming on board|date = 25 October 2014|accessdate = 7 March 2015|website = Marca|publisher = |last = Díaz|first = José Félix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pérez then said that in compliance to the agreement the name of the stadium would be renamed "IPIC Bernabeu" or "CEPSA Bernabeu".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/real-madrids-stadium-be-renamed-ipic-bernabeu-cepsa-bernabeu-1475647|title = Real Madrid's Stadium to be Renamed 'IPIC Bernabeu or CEPSA Bernabeu'|date = 19 November 2014|accessdate = 7 March 2015|website = International Business Times (UK)|publisher = |last = Martin|first = Sean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cityam.com/208144/real-madrid-stadium-could-be-renamed-abu-dhabi-bernabeu-due-uae-investment|title = Real Madrid stadium could be renamed "Abu Dhabi Bernabeu" due to UAE investment|date = 28 January 2015|accessdate = 7 March 2015|website = CITY A.M.|publisher = |last = Hall|first = Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://zeenews.india.com/sports/football/real-madrid-president-caught-revealing-ipic-stadium-name_1501586.html|title = Real Madrid president caught revealing ''IPIC'' stadium name|date = 19 November 2014|accessdate = 7 March 2015|website = Zee News|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The surface has been replaced with Mixto hybrid grass.

Real Madrid and Microsoft launched the first interactive audioguide for the Bernabéu Tour on 3 April 2017. Over 200,000 people toured the stadium in 2016, of which over 60% were foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Real Madrid C.F. and Microsoft Launch the First Interactive Audioguide for the Bernabéu Tour|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/real-madrid-cf-and-microsoft-launch-the-first-interactive-audioguide-for-the-bernabeu-tour-617980163.html|website=www.prnewswire.com|accessdate=6 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renovation plans==
The €400&amp;nbsp;million project is set to begin in summer 2017. The capacity will not be increased and will remain at 81,000 seats. It is still unknown what will be the name of the stadium, as it will change due to the sponsorship agreement. The stadium will grow ten metres in height and the roof will be added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2017/02/16/58a591e0ca47414c6c8b4572.html|title=Real Madrid's new Bernabeu to grow over 10 metres in height - MARCA in English|work=MARCA in English|access-date=9 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is expected to last three years and the stadium is aimed to be finished at the beginning of the 2020–21 season.

In order for the project not to get in the way of playing matches, the team will use Roman techniques with raising the top, which will make it easier for the works to continue while the season is underway and there are matches once or twice a week. "The project is complex because it will not stop the football and therefore complicates the works and design, which has a roof that encloses the whole stadium. They are going to lift the roof like the Romans did, but with modern technology. They will raise the inner ring by string-pulling with hydraulic jacks, bridge technology and ski lifts in a short period of time in the summer to respect the sporting calendar," said Tristán López Chicheri, the individual in charge of renovation.

Chicheri believes the renovation will bring tourists to the stadium all year round, with many attractions planned. The stadium is supposed to have more restaurants, a shopping centre and a hotel, with some rooms having a view of the pitch. "It is not only on matchdays that it will be used – there are venues like the Bernabéu that are in the middle of the city and it is a shame that they have no life beyond 35–40 matches a year," noted Chicheri.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2017/01/24/5887147c268e3e71148b458d.html|title=Santiago Bernabeu revamp set to begin this summer - MARCA in English|work=MARCA in English|access-date=9 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The areas around the Bernabéu will be rearranged: the Plaza de los Sagrados Corazones will be removed to be replaced by 6,000 square metres of gardens.
{{wide image|Estadio Santiago Bernabéu (01).jpg|1000px|Panorama of the stadium|alt=Panorama of the stadium}}

=====Final=====
{{main article|1982 FIFA World Cup Final}}
The 1982 FIFA World Cup Final was a football match contested between Italy and West Germany. It was played on 11 July 1982.&lt;br /&gt;
After a scoreless first half during which [[Antonio Cabrini]] fired a penalty low and wide to the right of goal, [[Paolo Rossi]] scored first, heading home a bouncing Claudio Gentile cross from the right from close range. [[Marco Tardelli]] then scored from the edge of the area with a low left footed shot before [[Alessandro Altobelli]], at the end of a counterattack by winger Bruno Conti, made it 3–0 with another low left footed shot.
Italy's lead appeared secure, encouraging Italian president [[Sandro Pertini]] to wag his finger at the cameras in a playful 'not going to catch us now' gesture from the stands. [[Paul Breitner]] scored for Germany in the 83rd minute, firing low past the goalkeeper from the right, but Italy held on to claim their first World Cup title in 44 years, and their third in total with a 3–1 victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=GGgVawPscysC&amp;dat=19820712&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en|title=Sparkling Italy spring ultimate upset |date=12 July 1982|work=Glasgow Herald |accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inter won 2–0 after two goals from [[Diego Milito]].

'''2018 Copa Libertadores Final'''

{{Main|2018 Copa Libertadores Finals}}

The 2018 CONMEBOL (South America federation) final between Buenos Aires, Argentina archrivals [[Boca Juniors]] and [[Club Atlético River Plate]] was a two-legged tie, with River Plate leading 2-2 on the away goals tiebreaker following the 11 November 2018 first leg held at [[Estadio Alberto J. Armando]], at Boca Juniors' home pitch.  

During the planned second leg, scheduled for [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti]], the home pitch of River Plate, on 24 November 2018, numerous River Plate spectators threw glass bottles and fired missiles at the Boca Juniors team bus headed to the stadium, injuring numerous players as a result.  CONMEBOL postponed the match and moved the second leg to 9 December 2018 at Madrid for security and travel reasons.  Because the [[2018 FIFA Club World Cup]] in the United Arab Emirates is to be conducted three days after the rescheduled final, the decision was made to hold the final in Madrid, a neutral site, at the home pitch of UEFA nominee [[Real Madrid C.F.]], which would allow the winning club to fly to the UAE and arrive with sufficient time.

'''Source Vagabond Systems Ltd.''' (brand: '''SOURCE''') is known in the outdoor, trekking and sports market for sandals, hydration systems, packs and accessories and in the tactical market for hydration systems, packs, and its SOURCE Virtus Soldier System.

==History==
SOURCE (Shoresh in Hebrew) was founded in 1989 by Yoki Gill and Daniel Benoziliyo and now employs more than 200 workers. It has always been a groundbreaker in hydration and sandal technology and is well known in the Tactical Gear, hiking sandals, hydration and travel accessories categories worldwide for over 20 years, currently selling in more than 25 countries, including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Switzerland, Australia, South Africa and many more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sourceoutdoor.com/en/content/4-about-us |title=About Us |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=SourceOutdoor.com |publisher=SOURCE |access-date=2015-10-27 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source Sandals==
The first [[Source Sandals]] were sold in 1991 under the name Shoresh (Hebrew for root, spring: שורש), at this time there were 3 models: The Biblical sandal, The Roman sandal, The Asia sandal.

The sandals were already featuring the 3 layered sole and the X-strap system, a design protected by a patent allowing the sandal to be fit to the foot independently from the heel. In 1995 the sandals were renamed and the Trek and the Stream appeared. Ten years later, in 2005, 8 references were on the catalog, among them the names of today’s sandals, the Classic, the Stream (+ the sport version), the Gobi, and the Djibouti. In 2008, the Adama sandal technology was launched with three models that didn’t work out.

==Source Hydration Systems==
In 1993 the first hydration system was introduced to the market, the Flexi-Flask, it was a water bottle protected by a tissu cover. Two volumes capacities were available, 1,5L and 2,5L. In 1995, the first water pipe was added to the water system. In 2000 more than 8 references were on the catalog for the hydration packs and accessories for the hydration systems were available: Rapid valve, Tube Kit, Source Filler Cap,  Source Tik-Cap,  Weave-Covered Tube Kit, Replacement Inner Bag

In 2005, we can find in the catalog the liquitainer a foldable bottle and a large variety of hydration packs featuring the widepac opening system, a patented system allowing a large opening to fill, clean and dry easily the bladder. The new references at this time have the names of today references, the Spinner, the Whistler and the Transporter. A winter collection has appeared however the company stopped to produce it.

Looking at the valves, the evolution in term of design and color can be observed through the years. In 2008, the Z-valve and the Storm valve are protected by US patent.

==Source Tactical Gear==
In 2008, Source entered the military hydration system market with the WXP hydration system and the NBC technology. Besides that, 27 references where on the military catalog. Today Source is supplying armies around the world and the Tactical division has been separated to the outdoor one.

===Virtus Soldier System===
In 2015 SOURCE was awarded a multi-year contract by the British MoD to supply an initial quantity of 9000 personal protection and load carriage systems to the British Army. SOURCE Virtus Soldier System is a new fully integrated personal protection and load carriage system. First units are supplied from Fall 2015.

[[File:Athletics track.jpg|thumb|right|Starting places on tartan track]]
'''Tartan Track''' is a [[trademarked]] all-weather synthetic track surfacing made of [[polyurethane]] used for [[track and field]] competitions, manufactured by [[3M]].  It lets athletes compete in bad weather without serious performance loss and improves their results over other surfaces.  It also provides a more consistent surface for competition even under optimum weather.  Such tracks have become the standard for most elite competitions.  

Because the "Tartan" brand name was the first and was widely successful in its time, the name Tartan has been incorrectly{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} used as a [[genericized trademark]] for description of an [[all-weather running track]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.athleticsireland.ie/content/?p=5970 |title=example 1 of misused term |publisher=Athleticsireland.ie |date=2009-03-25 |accessdate=2014-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201204318/http://www.athleticsireland.ie/content/?p=5970 |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coloribus.com/adsarchive/prints/pritt-correct-it-refill-roller-tartan-track-9501805/ |title=example 2 of misused term |publisher=Coloribus.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3M's first generation [[artificial turf]] of the late 1960s and early 1970s was branded as "Tartan Turf."&lt;ref name=trnost&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KB4cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=O1EEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7477%2C5041055 |newspaper=Pittsburgh Press |last=Spatter |first=Sam |title='Three Rivers' name of stadium |date=February 12, 1969 |page=66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The [[1968 Summer Olympics]] at [[Mexico City]] was the first [[Olympic Games]] to use the Tartan track surface in athletics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Oscar Johnson |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119745/index.htm |title=Sports Illustrated August 12, 1985 |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=1985-08-12 |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics – Men's shot put|Olympic shot put champion]] [[Bill Nieder]] was instrumental in developing the product and selling it for use in the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elitetrack.com/blogs-details-2764/ |title=Bill Nieder: Putter Formulated The Rubber Room |publisher=Elitetrack |date= |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

American track and field coach [[Bert Bonanno]], who had been recruited by the Mexican Olympic Committee to help prepare their athletes, worked as a liaison between the Mexican officials and manufacturer 3M in 1968.&lt;ref name="air"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8NCXcrGcjiwC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110 |title=Something in the Air: American Passion and Defiance in the 1968 Mexico City Olympics |publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press|Bison Books]] |author=Richard Hoffer   |year=2009 |pages=110–113 |accessdate=March 5, 2015|isbn=978-0-8032-3629-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  “It had been red cinder at the Olympic Games up until then. 3M hired [[Jesse Owens]] to assist them to convince the Mexican Olympic Committee to put that track in,” Bonanno said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speedendurance.com/2011/03/02/bud-winter-biography-san-jose-state-university-1940-1970-part-1/ |title=Bud Winter Biography, San Jose State University 1940-1970, Part 1|publisher=SpeedEndurance.com  |accessdate=March 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Tartan track was constructed for the men's [[United States Olympic Trials (track and field)|U.S. Olympic Trials]] at [[Echo Summit]], [[California]], west of [[South Lake Tahoe, California|South Lake Tahoe]]. Just off [[U.S. Route 50 in California|U.S. Route 50]], it was built in the summer of 1968 in the parking lot of Nebelhorn ski area, at an [[elevation]] of {{convert|7377|ft}}.&lt;ref name=olcpb&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rztWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dekDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7207%2C298421 |newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=Spokane, Washington |title=Olympic camp's press 'ban' unpopular |last=Payne |first=Bob |date=August 16, 1968 |page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original trade name "Tartan" came from 3M, manufacturers of [[Scotch Tape]] and continuing the Scotch name tradition.  Those original tracks required [[mercury (element)|mercury]] as a catalyst, later found to be an environmental hazard.  An independent company has perfected the process without mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tartan-aps.com/checking_for_mercury.php |title=Tartan Tracks Mercury test |publisher=Tartan-aps.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are now numerous competitors in the "all-weather track" industry.  In fact, the "Tartan" tracks of the late 1960s were the second generation of all-weather track surfacing.  Before that, there were several tracks constructed of rubber (usually [[Tire recycling|tire shavings]]) and asphalt.  The first recorded use of a Tartan Track surface in competition in England was a [[long jump]] at the Norman Green Sports Centre in [[Solihull]], September 16, 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.runtrackdir.com/details.asp?track=solihull |title=Norman Green Athletics Centre |publisher=Runtrackdir.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there were earlier uses in the United States.

==Plot==
Nasim, a poor [[Afghan refugees|Afghan refugee]] in Iran, gives a demonstration in his town's square where he rides his bicycle without stopping for seven days and seven nights, with the aim of raising money for life-saving surgery for his dying wife. In the end, even after seven days, he continues to pedal endlessly, too fatigued to hear his son's and the crowd's pleas to get off his bicycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adelkhah|Olszewska|2007|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar analyses the film as an [[allegory]] which parallels the exploitation that Afghan refugees suffer from in Iran and from which they are unable to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adelkhah|Olszewska|2007|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hank Greenberg 1937 cropped.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Hank Greenberg]], Hall of Famer and 2-time MVP.]]
'''''The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg''''' is a 1998 [[documentary film]] written, directed, and produced by [[Aviva Kempner]] about [[Hank Greenberg]], first baseman of the [[Detroit Tigers]], who was inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]]. A Jewish player who chose not to play on [[Yom Kippur]] in 1934 during a heated pennant race, Greenberg had to face a great deal of [[antisemitism]]. In 1938 he nearly broke [[Babe Ruth]]'s 60 home run record by hitting 58 home runs.

Like many players of the era, Greenberg had his career interrupted by military service during World War II. Initially, Greenberg was classified as unfit for service due to flat feet. However, upon re-examination, he was cleared. Before Japan's [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the [[United States Congress]] had released men over age 28. After the attack, Greenberg immediately reenlisted in the [[United States Army Air Forces]].

In 1947, Greenberg, as a member of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and playing his final season, was one of the few ballplayers to give a warm welcome to [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]' [[Jackie Robinson]], the majors' first [[African-American|black]] player in many years. Robinson later said, "Class tells. It sticks out all over Mr. Greenberg".{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== Production ==
Kempner states that the film took 13 years to make.  "It was all about raising money for the rights to the archival and feature footage. That was so expensive that I had to stop and start about 20 times."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insightnews.com/aesthetics/10810-aviva-kempner-qthe-life-and-times-of-hank-greenbergq&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Waikato AFL begun in humble fashion in 2004 when an ex-pat Western Australian started some training sessions in Hamilton. Jim Lucy had been a coach and Administrator with Takapuna AFL in Auckland, but wanted to grow the game in the Waikato where he was based. So in 2004 he created an article in the Waikato Times newspaper. A number of sportsman were interested in the sport and came along to see what it was all about. That first year saw 15-20 men meet at Eliott Park to learn the skills and game of Australian Rules Football. 
In 2005 the numbers grew until around 30 men met each Sunday. With numbers too small to form a competition, players learnt the skills and played "scratch" matches amongst themselves using a rugby field. Ambitiously they joined the AFLNZ in a weekend tournament to compete against the 3 established provinces; Auckland, Wellington and Canterbury. The NPC has been held around the Labour Weekend period but in a current restructuring will be moving to early December in 2013.
The Waikato representative side team took on the name, Waikato Thunder AFL (WTAFL) to distinguish themselves from Wellington AFL (WAFL) who had formed years prior.

Since entering their inaugural National Provincial Competition the Waikato Thunder have continued to grow. They now have 2 full-time teams Hamilton Mavericks, Hamilton Tuis) that compete each week and are on their way to forming a permanent 3rd Hamilton based team (Redbacks). The WTAFL season runs from mid August through to late October/early November. Games are currently held at Derek Heather Park in Western Heights, Hamilton on Saturdays at 1pm. Finding a permanent location for the sport is difficult due to the size of the field required - and oval 150m long by 110m wide. A permanent base is being sought within the Hamilton area.

==Representative Side==
The representative side for the Waikato AFL is known as the ''Waikato Thunder''.
