'''110 and 112 Harley Street''' are [[grade II listed]] terraced town houses in [[Harley Street]], in the [[City of Westminster]], London. The houses were of the "first rate" class, built around 1777 as part of the [[Portland Estate]] (now the Howard de Walden Estate), probably by John White and the plasterer Thomas Collins who were associated with [[Sir William Chambers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE|num=1229963|desc=110 and 112, Harley Street W1|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1670">The '''Amish Paste''' [[Heirloom plant|heirloom]] [[tomato]] is, as the name implies, a [[plum tomato]] of [[Amish]] origins, that is commonly used for cooking, although it's sweet enough to eat fresh.

==History==
The Amish Paste tomato is reputed to have originated in the 1870s with the oldest Amish community in [[Wisconsin]]; [[Medford, Wisconsin|Medford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomatodirt.com/amish-paste-tomato.html Amish Paste Tomato]&lt;/ref&gt; 

It became popular once acquired by Tom Hauch of Heirloom Seeds organization, from the Amish of [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]], and was first distributed nationally in the [[Seed Savers]] edition 1987, by Thane Earle of [[Whitewater]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seedsavers.org/onlinestore/tomato_3/Tomato-Amish-Paste.html Amish Paste - Seed Savers Exchange]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Plant==
This is one of the larger "paste" varieties of tomato, its fruit growing from 6 to 12 ounces. It varies widely in shape, from "oxheart" to plum, and though coreless, is somewhat seedier and sweeter than normal paste cultivars. They tend to ripen 80 to 85 days after planting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whiteflowerfarm.com/4957-product.html Tomato Amish Paste]&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant is an [[indeterminate growth|indeterminate]] variety, growing continually until it dies (like all tomato plants, it's a delicate perennial, that would not die if growing in the warm climate to which tomatoes are native). Because it has relatively sparse foliage, the fruit is more exposed to sunlight than a normal plant, making sunscald an issue.

'''Ancient Chinese States''' ({{zh|t=諸侯|s=诸侯|p=Zhūhóu}}) were typified by variously sized city states and territories that existed in China prior to its unification by [[Qin Shi Huang]] in 221 BCE. In many cases these were [[vassal states]] characterized by tribute paid to the ruling [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046&amp;ndash;256 BCE).&lt;ref name="Keay"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Keay|first=John|title=China – A History|year=2009|publisher=Harper Collins|isbn=978-0-00-722178-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}} Such states and [[fiefdom]]s would again emerge during later dynasties as a political expedient when required.

==Background==
According to the [[Sinocentrism|sinocentric]] viewpoint and the [[Mandate of Heaven]], China was the center of the world and the incumbent emperor its only ruler; all other would-be potentates and rulers were merely vassals of the Middle Kingdom. As a result, from the earliest times the Chinese viewed the world as a series of concentric spheres of influence emanating outward from their capital. Within the closest circle lay the vassal states who pledged allegiance to the Zhou ruler. Apart from the [[Zhou dynasty]] itself, which occupied territory around its capital, each state bore the suffix ''-guó'' ({{lang|zh|國}}/{{lang|zh|国}}) meaning state or nation. Of the 150 or so states,&lt;ref&gt;Loewe and Shaughnessy, 'The Cambridge History of Ancient China', 1999, page 567&lt;/ref&gt; some were little more than a small fortified town or city, and others had a capital and other urban areas, controlling significant amounts of territory.

==History==
===Western Zhou===
Following the overthrow of the [[Shang dynasty]] in 1046 BCE, the early kings made hereditary land grants to various relatives and descendants.&lt;ref name="Keay"/&gt;{{rp|57}} These [[enfeoffment]]s were accompanied by a title according to the [[Chinese nobility|Five Orders of Nobility]]{{Cref2|A}} (五等爵位), with only the Zhou ruler bearing the title of "[[Chinese king|King]]" ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|王}}}}, ''wáng''). Along with the land and title came a responsibility to support the Zhou king during an emergency and to pay [[Ancestor veneration in China|ritual homage]] to the Zhou ancestors. In the [[Yellow River]] Valley, of the earliest vassal states, the [[Cai (state)|State of Cai]] was founded following a grant of land by the [[King Wu of Zhou|first Zhou King]] to his younger brother. Other states founded at this time included [[Cao (state)|Cao]], [[Yan (state)|Yan]], [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]], and [[Chen (state)|Chen]]. The central [[Song (state)|State of Song]] was created as a land grant to the nobility of the defeated Shang dynasty. On the periphery, the states of [[Yan (state)|Yan]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]], and [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]] in the north and northeast had more room to expand and grew into large states.&lt;ref name="CK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/zhou-map.html|title=Chinese History – Zhou Dynasty|publisher=ChinaKnowledge.de|accessdate=November 7, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101121095458/http://chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/zhou-map.html| archivedate= 21 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the south, [[Xiong Yi]] was granted the fiefdom of [[Chu (state)|Chu]], which grew powerful and its later rulers declared themselves kings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guoxue.com/shibu/24shi/shiji/sj_040.htm 史记 楚世家 (House of Chu, [[Records of the Grand Historian]])] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310023405/http://www.guoxue.com/shibu/24shi/shiji/sj_040.htm |date=2012-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At this time, states (such as Yue) that were considered not as civilized were not eligible for vassaldom.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gongyang Zhuan]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lewis | first=Mark Edward |editor-first=Timothy| editor-last=Brook |title=History of Imperial China|publisher=Cambridge: Harvard University Press|year=2008|page=39|chapter=The Early Chinese Empires: Qin and Han |isbn=978-0-674-02477-9}} p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  Around the borders of the main states lay many smaller entities which over time would be absorbed by their larger neighbors.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Book of Songs (Chinese)|Book of Songs]] '' (诗经)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spring and Autumn period===
{{see also|Interstate relations during the Spring and Autumn period}}
After an attack by [[Quanrong]] nomads allied with several vassal states including [[Shen (state)|Shen]] and Zheng, the Zhou ruler [[King You of Zhou|King You]] was killed in his palace at [[Haojing]]. His son fled east and was enthroned by several vassal leaders as [[King Ping of Zhou]] .Thus began the Eastern Zhou Dynasty when a new capital constructed a capital at Luoyi (雒邑), modern day [[Luoyang]]. Since territory around the city was restricted because other states including [[Han (state)|Han]] and Wei were already established in the area, it was impossible for the Zhou to expand their territory, a factor that became increasingly important as a survival mechanism for smaller states.&lt;ref name="CK" /&gt; New states continued to emerge whilst Chu was by this stage a powerful southern vassal, having shaken off its former “barbarian” image, as was Qin in the West.&lt;br /&gt;  

Between the seventh and sixth centuries a four-way balance of power emerged between Qin (west), Jin (west-center), Chu (south) and Qi (east) whilst a number of smaller states continued to exist between Jin and Qi. The [[Deng (state)|State of Deng]] was overthrown by Chu in 678 BCE followed by Qin’s annexation of [[Hua (state)|State of Hua]] in 627 BCE, establishing a pattern that would gradually see all smaller states eliminated.  Towards the end of the Spring and Autumn Period wars between states became increasingly common and a pattern of alliances developed amongst the more powerful rulers.

===Hegemons===
{{Main|Five Hegemons}}
As the power of the Zhou king’s weakened, the Spring and Autumn period saw the emergence of [[hegemony|hegemons]] ({{zh|c=霸|p=Bà}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.english.cciv.cityu.edu.hk/China_5000/?chapter=dicts/Spring_and_Autumn_Period |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005122732/http://www.english.cciv.cityu.edu.hk/China_5000/?chapter=dicts%2FSpring_and_Autumn_Period |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-10-05 |title=The Zhou Dynasty |publisher=Chinese Civilisation Centre, City University of Hong Kong |accessdate=November 11, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who held power over all other vassal states to raise armies and attack mutual enemies. 
Meetings were also held between the current hegemon and the rulers of the vassal states where ritual ceremonies took place that included swearing of oaths of allegiance to the current Zhou king and each other .&lt;ref&gt;''[[Zuo Zhuan]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Warring States period===
{{further information|Warring States Period}}
In 704 BCE, Chu state leader Xiong Tong (熊通) was the first vassal ruler to declare himself equal to the Zhou when he adopted the title [[King Wu of Chu]]. All the other states gradually followed suit until Zhou rule finally collapsed in 256 BCE. States continued to emerge as in the case of [[Zhongshan (state)|Zhongshan]] in the north, which was established by the nomadic Bai [[Beidi|Di]] (白翟) in the 5th century BCE and would last until 295 BCE.&lt;br&gt;

By about 300 BCE, only seven main states remained: Chu, Han, Qi, Qin, Yan, Wei and Zhao. Some of these built [[rammed earth]] walls along their frontiers to protect themselves both from the other states and raids by nomadic tribes like the Quanrong and [[Xiongnu]]. Smaller states like Zheng and Song were absorbed by their more powerful neighbors. The “non-Chinese” states of Ba and Shu were both conquered by Qin by 316 BCE.

===Qin Empire===
Following his [[Qin dynasty|unification of China]] in 221 BCE, the first emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] eliminated noble titles which did not conform to his [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalist]] system of government; one that believed in merit rather than the privileges of birth. He forced all the vassal leaders to attend the capital where he seized their states and turned them into administrative districts classified as either [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] or [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|counties]] depending on their size. The officials who ran the new districts were selected on merit rather than by family connections.&lt;br&gt;

===Han dynasty===
In the early years of the [[Han Dynasty]], the commanderies established during the Qin Dynasty once more became vassal states in all but name. [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gaozu]] (r. 202&amp;ndash;195) granted virtually autonomous territories to his relatives and a few generals with military prowess. Over time these vassal states grew powerful and presented a threat to the ruler. Eventually, during the reign of [[Emperor Jing of Han|Emperor Jing]] (r. 156&amp;ndash;141 BCE), his political advisor [[Chao Cuo]] recommended the abolition of all fiefdoms, a policy that led in 154 BCE to the [[Rebellion of the Seven Princes]]. The [[Liu Pi, Prince of Wu|Prince of Wu Liu Bi (劉濞)]] revolted first and was followed by the rulers of six further states. The rebellion continued for three months until it was finally quelled. Later, [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] further weakened the power of the vassal states by eliminating many fiefdoms and restoring central control over their prefectures and counties.

'''Antichthones''', in [[geography]], are those peoples who inhabit the [[antipodes]], regions on opposite sides of the [[Earth]]. The word is compounded of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ὰντὶ'' ("opposed") and ''χθών'' ("earth").

[[Image:Climatic zones and antipodes.png|180px|right]]
[[Classical Europe|Classical]] and [[Medieval Europe]] considered the Earth to be divided by the [[equator]] into two [[Sphere|hemispheres]], the northern and southern; those who inhabited one of these hemispheres were said to be antichthones to those of the other. This idea was expounded by [[Pomponius Mela|Mela]] and other Classical authors, though Christian writers, who believed that all people on earth must be descended from Adam, denied the possibility that any southern land, if it existed, could be inhabited by humans. [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], arguing from a position of scriptural [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]], wrote in his ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'' "it is too absurd to say, that some men might have taken ship and traversed the whole wide ocean, and crossed from this side of the world to the other, and that thus even the inhabitants of that distant region are descended from that one first man."&lt;ref name="CITYO'GOD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dods |first1=Marcus (translator) |authorlink1=Philip Schaff |last2=St. Augustine |authorlink2=Augustine of Hippo |title=St. Augustine's City of God and Christian Doctrine |chapter=Book XVI, Chapter 9.—Whether We are to Believe in the Antipodes. |volume=2 |editor1=Philip Schaff |work=A Select Library of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church |publisher=The Christian Literature Publishing Co. |year=1890 |location=New York, New York |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XVI.9.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030702022213/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XVI.9.html |archivedate=July 2, 2003 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=August 24, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mali arrondissements.png|thumb|right|400px|Arrondissements of Mali (outlined in white), with [[Cercles of Mali|Cercles]] in grey and [[Regions of Mali|Regions]] in black.]]

The [[Cercles of Mali|cercles]] of [[Mali]] are divided into [[arrondissement]]s. These are further divided into 703 [[Communes of Mali|communes]], 19 urban and 684 rural. Unlike communes or cercles, arrondissements have no administrative power or elected officials: they are merely territorial divisions or used to divide administrative duties.  Often the borders of communes and arrondisements coincide, rendering the arrondissement demarcation of the territory superfluous.

The '''Association of Environmental Professionals''' (AEP) is a California-based [[non-profit]] organization of [[interdisciplinary]] professionals including [[environmental science]], [[resource management]], [[environmental planning]] and other professions contributing to this field.  AEP is the first organization of its kind in the USA, and its influence and model have spawned numerous other regional organizations throughout the United States, as well as the separate [[National Association of Environmental Professionals]] (NAEP).  Its mission is to improve the technical skills of members, and the organization is dedicated to "the enhancement, maintenance and protection of the natural and human environment".  From inception in the mid-1970s the organization has been closely linked with the upkeep of the [[California Environmental Quality Act]] (CEQA), California being one of the first states to adopt a comprehensive law to govern the environmental review of public policy and project review.

==History, organization and governance==

AEP was incorporated in the State of California in 1975 and held its first organization wide meeting of members in [[Palo Alto]], California on the [[Stanford University]] campus.  At that meeting the first directors and officers were elected and [[by-laws]] adopted.  From then on the board of directors has met quarterly to establish governance, coordinate legislative liassion and plan annual meeting.  The board represents eight geographical regions and also has three at large members.

==Publications and member activities==

AEP publishes a quarterly magazine, the [[Environmental Monitor]], which contains technical articles, [[legislative]] updates and other information useful to its members.  As mentioned above the organization has developed a skilled legislative [[advocacy]] program, which is remarkable in its pursuit of clarity of language, efficient functioning of environmental review and ethical goals for its profession.  AEP also provides annual recognition awards for excellence in various categories, provides members with information on career development and works to achieve standards for performance in the environmental disciplines.

The Environmental Monitor magazine is recognized throughout the interdisciplinary professions as a leading source of state of the art coverage.  Articles may include topics of [[air quality]], [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] conservation, [[water quality]], [[archaeology]], [[urban planning]], [[acoustics]] and other technical matters; however coverage is also given to legislation, AEP activities and professional career development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2331">'''Bioclimatology''' is the [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of science that studies the interactions between the [[biosphere]] and the [[Earth's atmosphere]] on time scales of the order of seasons or longer (by opposition to [[biometeorology]]).

==Examples of relevant processes==

[[Climate]] processes largely control the distribution, size, shape and properties of living organisms on [[Earth]]. For instance, the general circulation of the atmosphere on a planetary scale broadly determines the location of large [[desert]]s or the regions subject to frequent [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], which, in turn, greatly determine which organisms can naturally survive in these environments. Furthermore, changes in climates, whether due to natural processes or to human interferences, may progressively modify these [[Habitat (ecology)|habitats]] and cause [[overpopulation (biology)|overpopulation]] or [[extinction]] of indigenous species.

The biosphere, for its part, and in particular continental [[vegetation]], which constitutes over 99% of the total [[biomass]], has played a critical role in establishing and maintaining the chemical composition of the [[Earth's atmosphere]], especially during the early evolution of the planet (See [[History of Earth]] for more details on this topic). Currently, the terrestrial vegetation exchanges some 60 billion tons of [[carbon]] with the atmosphere on an annual basis (through processes of [[carbon fixation]] and [[carbon respiration]]), thereby playing a critical role in the [[carbon cycle]]. On a global and annual basis, small imbalances between these two major fluxes, as do occur through changes in [[land cover]] and [[land use]], contribute to the current increase in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]].

A ''darugha'' was ruled by ''[[darughachi]]''.

Later, the term was used for the province, particularly in [[Kazan Khanate|Kazan]] and the [[Siberian Khanate]]s in the 15th-16th centuries; and finally in the Turkic-populated parts of the [[Russian Empire]] in 16th-18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{TES|Даруга}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Safavid Persia, it was a title meaning ''[[prefect]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mikaberidze|first1=Alexander|title=Historical Dictionary of Georgia|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-1-44224-146-6|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the many Safavid darughas was [[Mirman Mirimanidze]].

In 1762, the [[Bashkir people]] controlled the Kazan Darugha, the Nogai Darugha, the Osin Darugha, and the Siberian Darugha.&lt;ref&gt;Rychkov Petr Ivanovich: "Topography of Orenburg" Russia St. Petersburg, 1762 page 93&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Mughal Empire]] of [[South Asia]], ''darugha'' was the title of the district police officer. This title was kept until the 20th century during the [[British Raj]].

'''Douglas R. Powell''' (1920–2006) was a [[geographer]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He was known for being one of the first snow surveyors in the world. He worked with the California Cooperate Snow Survey for 28 years and established snow surveying programs in Afghanistan and Chile.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;[http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/douglasrpowell.html Faculty senate: in memoriam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518211620/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/douglasrpowell.html |date=2011-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His "fabled"&lt;ref&gt;[http://geoimages.berkeley.edu/GeoImages/About_GeoImages.html GeoImages History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828105754/http://geoimages.berkeley.edu/GeoImages/About_GeoImages.html |date=August 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geography 197 field course, which he taught from 1967 until 1989, is fondly remembered by generations of Berkeley geography graduates.

[[File:EMEA region worldmap.svg|thumbnail|EMEA: [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]], marked on a world map.]]

'''EMEA''' ('''EMEIA''' if [[India]] is included) is a shorthand designation meaning [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]]. It is used by institutions and governments, as well as in marketing and business. It is particularly common among [[North America]]n companies.

The [[region]] is generally accepted to include all European nations, all African nations, and extends east to [[Iran]], including [[Russia]]. Typically this does not include independent overseas territories of mainland countries in the region, such as [[French Guiana]].

'''[[Dog agility]]''' is now an international [[dog sport]] with many different sanctioning organizations and competitions worldwide.

== Agility in the United Kingdom ==
[[File:Jake-tyre-agility.jpg|thumb|280px|A [[Kollie]] taking part in an agility competition.]]

=== Eligibility for competition ===
Dogs of all sizes and origins are eligible to compete at agility shows in the UK, provided that they are:
*Registered with the show's organising body, where required
*A minimum of 18 months of age (16 months in UKA nursery classes)
*Not a bitch in season
*Not suffering from any infectious or contagious disease 	
*Not of such a temperament as to be a danger to the safety of any person or other animal
*Not in a physical condition that would cause suffering when competing

=== Kennel Club shows ===
[[File:Brittany dog liver.jpg|thumb|280px|Brittany dog taking part in an agility competition.]]

[[File:German Shepherd Dog agility teeter.jpg|thumb|280px|A [[German Shepherd]] taking part in an agility competition.]]
Agility shows run by clubs that are affiliated to [[the Kennel Club]] continue to dominate the British agility scene. They host qualifiers for the most prestigious competitions at [[Crufts]] dog show near Birmingham each March, and [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] in London each December. They also provide a route for winning the three Championship classes needed to gain an agility dog the coveted 'Agility Champion' title.

Progression at KC shows is via a win-based system or a dog can progress on points if the handler chooses. Classes can number anything up to 450 dogs and class sizes vary considerably.  They can be as small as 4 or 5 dogs or as large as 200 dogs. If a larger number of entries is received for one class then the organising club will generally split the class into separate parts with a separate set of prizes for each part.  Generally classes for small and medium-sized dogs are smaller than for the large dogs. From January 2007, the KC has adopted a new [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930060358/http://www.agilityeye.co.uk/docs/Minutes-KCLC-AgilityCouncil-15Feb.pdf grading system]. Dogs with new handlers start in Grade 1 Elementary, and if they gain the wins required move up through Starters, Graduate, Novice, Intermediate and Senior to Grade 7 Advanced level. By the time a dog reaches Advanced (at which point it becomes eligible for Championship classes), it will have won many classes. The new grading system also provides the option to progress as far as Grade 5 Intermediate via a points system, run in conjunction with the Kennel Club's Agility Warrant (AW) agility titles.

The Kennel Club introduced its International Festival of Agility in 2005, a weekend event that hosts a range of national team and individual competitions and finals, including the British Open. The KC also funds the British agility team that is sent to the FCI world championships each year.

=== Other UK agility shows ===

The British Agility Association (BAA) was launched in 2006 Following the success of EMDAC (East Midlands Dog Agility Club which was the first Independent Agility Association in the UK founded in 2002 by June Bass &amp; Steve Retter) BAA provides its own progression system, with dogs being promoted via a ranking system based on performance at BAA shows. BAA shows are run both by the main EMDAC team and BAA affiliated independent clubs around the country. EMDAC host the BAA National Finals, a 3-day event in August each year.

UK Agility (UKA), launched in 2004, provides two separate progression programmes leading to agility titles. The Performance programme requires points to be gained in a range of Agility, Jumping and Games classes such as Gamblers and Snooker. This titling system has many similarities with that of the USDAA in the United States. The Steeplechase programme is based on Steeplechase classes consisting only of jumps and tunnels. UKA shows are run by both the main UKA team and affiliated independent clubs. UKA runs a weeklong show with its national championships in August each year, and also sends a team to the IFCS world championships.

In addition, a number of independent clubs and groups around the United Kingdom hold one-off shows or short series of shows that are not affiliated with any of the above organisations.

== Agility in Canada ==
In [[Canada]] dog agility is largely sanctioned by the Agility Association of Canada (AAC). In western Canada however, it is not uncommon to also see trials sanctioned by the North American Dog Agility Council (NADAC); in eastern Canada NADAC sanctioned trials are rare. Canadian Kennel Club (CKC) agility trials are uncommon and are mostly associated with specialty shows for purebreds in conjunction with other events.

== Agility in the United States ==
The first agility competition in the [[United States]] took place around 1986 under the rules of the newly formed [[United States Dog Agility Association]] (USDAA).

===Qualification for competition===
&lt;!-- Might be true in other countries, too, but I don't know for sure. -User:Elf --&gt;
For all organizations, dogs can compete provided that they are:
*Registered with the specific organization
*Physically sound (blindness, deafness &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akc.org/pdfs/rulebooks/REAGIL.pdf AKC Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt;, and physical impairments interfering with functional movement may disqualify a dog from eligibility; consult each organization for more specific information)
*At least the minimum age (for example, 15 months in AKC [http://www.akc.org/events/agility/jump_height_card.cfm] and CPE, 18 months in USDAA and NADAC)
*Not a female in heat (some venues allow bitches in season to compete, usually at the discretion of the hosting club)
*Well-behaved enough to be off leash around other dogs and people; for example, dogs who attack the judge, other people, or other dogs may be expelled from the trial site and may eventually be banned from competing

Dogs of any size, ancestry, or nationality can compete, except for in TDAA, which limits dogs to those of no more than 17" at the [[withers]]. On April 1, 2010, the AKC began allowing mixed breed dogs to compete in agility along with purebred dogs and dogs with a PAL/ILP listing.

===Agility titles and championships===
For most sanctioning organizations, there are a variety of titles that a dog and handler can earn by accruing sufficient qualifying runs—also called legs—that is, runs that have no more than a certain number of faults (typically none) and are faster than the maximum standard course time (SCT).

For example, under USDAA rules, a dog can earn novice-level titles in Standard, Jumpers, Gamblers, Snooker, and Pairs Relay classes by earning 3 qualifying runs in each of the classes; the dog can also earn intermediate-level titles and masters-level titles in the same classes. After earning all of the masters-level titles—five qualifying runs in each, with some that must be in the top 15% of dogs competing at each trial—the dog earns its Championship. Other organizations have similar schemes; in AKC, to earn the Championship, the dog's qualifying runs must be earned two at a time on the same day; in NADAC, the quantity of qualifying runs is much larger; and so on. Most champion titles have "CH" in the title: NATCH (NADAC Agility Trial Champion), ADCH (Agility Dog Champion for USDAA), CATCH (CPE Agility Trial Champion), MACH (Master Agility Champion for AKC), TACH (Teacup Agility Champion), ATCH (ASCA Agility Trial Champion) and so on.

===National championships===
[[File:Dogdalmatian jumping.jpg|thumb|280px|A dalmatian taking part in an agility competition.]]
In addition, each sanctioning organization holds its national championships each year. Dogs must meet certain minimum scoring requirements to qualify to compete in the annual championship; for example, the dog must earn qualifying scores in at least 50% of the runs at each of at least 3 trials during the year; or must place in the top certain percentage of dogs at certain trials; or must have a qualifying run in special regional qualifying events; and so on.

As with any agility competition, there are national champions in each height category because it is not  possible for dogs of greatly different sizes to compete equally.

====USDAA national championships====
USDAA has 12", 16", 22", and 26" (30, 40, 55, and 66&amp;nbsp;cm) jump-height categories; it crowns four national Grand Prix champions each year, as well as four Veterans and four Performance (lower-level performance) Grand Prix champions. It also holds championships for its Dog Agility Steeplechase and its Dog Agility Masters Three-Dog Team tournament series.

====AKC national championships====
To qualify for the AKC Dog Agility Nationals, dogs must obtain ''double Qs'' and points during the preceding year. (The exact number of each has been increasing each year - for 2008 it is 6 ''double Qs'' and 400 MACH points.)  A double Q means that the dog has earned  qualifying scores in both runs of a single day of competition. Points are earned by the number of seconds under the standard course time that the dog takes to run a course, and are multiplied by various factors based on placement. At Nationals, dogs compete against their height division of 8", 12", 16", 20", 24", or 26". The AKC Nationals are often televised.

The AKC also runs an annual breed invitational to represent the best dogs from each breed. The invitational qualification and competition are similar to those of the Nationals.

== International championships ==
Some competitions invite qualified entrants from multiple countries, thereby making them international championships. Examples include:

* [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] Agility World Championships, the oldest and best-known, is held every year. It had been held in Europe every year until 2013, where it is to be hosted by South Africa. The event was held as a European championship until 1995, then a world championship from 1996, and is restricted to registered pedigree dogs only. The FCI has more than 80 member countries (via each country's [[kennel club]]), over 30 of which typically take part in the FCI World Championships. The British, American and Canadian kennel clubs are not FCI members, but their teams are allowed to participate by special invitation.
* The International Mix &amp; Breed Championship in Agility (IMCA), first held in Italy in 2000 as a response to the FCI pedigree-only championships. The competition is held annually with about 18 countries participating, including teams from outside Europe. Now open to any breed or [[mixed-breed dog]] regardless of origins, and in Europe considered to be the main international rival to the FCI championships.
Since the 2002 IMCA (Gyula, Hungary), this championship is organised together with the ParAgility World Cup for disabled competitors.
* The International Federation of Cynological Sports (IFCS), has since 2002 organized a biannual world agility championship open to any breed or [[mixed-breed dog]] regardless of pedigree. English-speaking member or associate member countries include the United States (via the United States Dog Agility Association), the United Kingdom (via UK Agility), Canada (via the Agility Association of Canada), and Australia (via the Agility Dog Association of Australia). Ten countries participated in the event in 2006.
* The Cynosport World Games, officially named in 2003, as the consolidated venue for USDAA's three tournament series - ''Grand Prix of Dog Agility'', $10,000 ''Dog Agility Steeplechase'' and ''Dog Agility Masters'' Three-Dog Team Championship&amp;nbsp;— and exhibitions and competitions in other popular canine sports. USDAA tournaments were opened to invited overseas participants for the first time in 2001, which led to establishment of USDAA affiliates in other countries where qualifying events are now held each year. Prior to 2001, USDAA qualifying events were limited to Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the United States. The ''[[Cynosport World Games]]'' in 2006 attracted some 1,000 competitors in dog agility from twelve countries, and also now includes world championship events in flyball and flying disc. Participants from other countries may still apply for participation by invitation if USDAA qualifying events are not held in their country or region.
* The European Open. An informal annual championships since its foundation in 2002, open to all dogs regardless of origins. It rotates around a small number of countries in central Europe, though attracting competitors from all over Europe, with 25 countries due to participate in the 2006 event. From 2007, the competition will be held under Fédération Cynologique Internationale regulations, with a view to developing it into a 'World Open'. In years when the [[World Dog Show]] is held in Europe, the European Open will be held at the World Show and not separately.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4651">'''Geohashing''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|iː|oʊ|ˌ|h|æ|ʃ|ɪ|ŋ}} is an outdoor recreational activity inspired by the webcomic ''[[xkcd]]'', in which participants have to reach a random location (chosen by a [[algorithm|computer algorithm]]), prove their achievement by taking a picture of a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) [[GPS navigation device|receiver]] or another mobile device and then tell the story of their trip online. Proof based on non-electronic navigation is also acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Solivellas|first1=Benoit|title=Geohashing, les rencontres par GPS|url=http://www.cnetfrance.fr/news/geohashing-39382080.htm|accessdate=16 August 2015|work=CNET France|date=June 1, 2008|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas other outdoor recreational activities like [[geocaching]] have a precise goal, geohashing is mainly fueled by its pointlessness, which is deemed amusing by its players. (However, a variation on geocaching, known as [[Geocaching#Geodashing|geodashing]], features a closely comparable principle.) The resulting geohashing community and culture is thus extremely tongue-in-cheek, supporting any kind of humorous behavior during the practice of geohashing and resulting in a parody of traditional outdoor activities. Navigating to a random point need not be pointless. Some geohashers document new mapping features they find on the [[OpenStreetMap]] project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Cover_Stories Cover stories]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On May 21, 2008, the [http://www.xkcd.com/426 426th xkcd comic] was published. Titled "Geohashing", it described a way for a [[computer]] to create an algorithm that could generate random [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) coordinates each day based on the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] and the current date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xkcd.com/426/ xkcd comic number 426]&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithm was quickly seized by xkcd community, which used it as intended by xkcd creator Randall Munroe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Geohashing_wiki_history#Beta_Testing Beta testing the geohashing algorithm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally a stub where people willing to try the algorithm in real life were to issue their reports, the geohashing official wiki expanded in the following weeks and was a working website as early as June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Geohashing_wiki_history#The_Main_Page History of geohashing wiki main page]&lt;/ref&gt; The current expedition protocol was then established during the following years, with the creation of humorous awards, regional meetups and a hall of amazingness for the various geohasher achievements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Hall_of_Amazingness Hall of Amazingness]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, geohashing gained fame across the [[internet]] and now counts more than 10,000 expedition reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Expedition_10000 10,000th expedition]&lt;/ref&gt; 19,000 users are registered on the geohashing wiki, with only 23 active as of March 19, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Special:Statistics Geohashing wiki statistics]&lt;/ref&gt; Geohashing has spread mostly in North America, Europe and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Maps_and_statistics Maps and statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geohash ==
[[File:Geohash 2014-01-13 Location.jpg|thumb|The [[sign]] forbids a geohasher to trespass and reach the location set by the algorithm. His expedition has to end there.]]
Geohashing divides the earth into a grid made up of graticules which are one degree wide in latitude and longitude. Inside these graticules, a random location is set. Geohashers then have the opportunity to go at the chosen location, either inside their own graticule or in a nearby one. If the location is inaccessible or in a private area, geohashers are advised not to try to reach it, although obviously inaccessible locations have been reached several times. In addition to the repeating location in each graticule, each day there is a single global hashpoint, much more challenging to reach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.xkcd.com/geohashing/Hall_of_Amazingness#Conquering_Nature.2C_Technology_and_Bodily_Weakness Conquering Nature]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geologic History, Stratigraphy &amp; Tectonics==
*Dalmatian-Herzegovinian Zone: This Dinaridic zone was first described in 1948 as the Old Montenegro Overthrust and includes [[Anisian]] age [[flysch]] and limestone, thin [[Ladinian]] volcano-sedimentary rock, Late Triassic carbonates and Jurassic neritic carbonates, a break in deposition, and then thick Cretaceous, Paleocene and Eocene foraminiferal limestone. It spans southwestern Montenegro. 
*Sarajevo Sigmoid: A belt of Mesozoic flysch units beginning in Albania and spanning central Montenegro toward the northwest. It is overthrust in the east along the Durmitor Nappe and includes shallow marine Permian and Triassic platform carbonates and clastic rocks. An unconformity separates lower units from Jurassic calcareous rocks and the Senonian Dumitor Flysch.

*East Bosnian-Durmitor Block: Much of northern and eastern inland Montenegro is underlain by this pile of [[nappe]] features, dating back to the Devonian. Paleozoic rocks include slightly metamorphosed fine-grained clastics, with conglomerate, limestone and [[keratophyre]] lenses. Continental clastics, limestone and volcanic rocks following an unconformity begin in the Triassic. Metamorphosed [[mafic]] rocks are found in the southeast, surrounded by unusual granite body which may have resulted from uncommon in situ granitization. 

Other geologic features include:

*Vlajna-Kukavica Mountain
*Cehotina Nappe

The '''German-Luxembourg Nature Park''' ({{lang-de|Deutsch-Luxemburgische Naturpark}}) is a cross-border [[nature park]], which was established on 17&amp;nbsp;April 1964 by [[state treaty]] between the German state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and the Grand Duchy of [[Luxembourg]]. It thus became the first cross-border nature park in Western Europe.

The '''Guardafui Channel''' is an oceanic [[strait]] off the tip of the [[Horn of Africa]]. In its broader sense it refers to the strait between [[Somalia]] and [[Socotra]],&lt;ref&gt;Schott, Friedrich A., and Jürgen Fischer. "Winter monsoon circulation of the northern Arabian Sea and Somali Current." Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans 105.C3 (2000): 6359-6376.&lt;/ref&gt; and in its narrower sense to the strait between Puntland and [[Abd al Kuri]].&lt;ref&gt;Schott, Friedrich, et al. "Summer monsoon response of the northern Somali Current, 1995." Geophysical Research Letters 24.21 (1997): 2565-2568.&lt;/ref&gt; It connects the [[Gulf of Aden]] to the north with the [[Indian Ocean]] to the south. Its namesake is [[Cape Guardafui]], the very tip of the Horn of Africa.

Its width is roughy 100 kilometers between Ras Asir ([[Gardafuul]]) and Abd al Kari,&lt;ref&gt;The Biology of Island Floras - Page 198, Juli Caujapé-Castells - 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and roughly 240 kilometers between Ras Asir and Socotra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.youth.cn/yculture/200911/t20091118_1085530.htm|work=en.youth.cn|publisher=China Youth International|title=Socotra islands scenery in Yemen|date=25 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
The oceanic strait goes by many names, including the ''Ras Hafun Strait'', named after the headland of [[Ras Hafun]], near the town of [[Foar]],&lt;ref&gt;British possessions, II : The Congo, no. 96-99 - Page 38, Sir George Walter Prothero, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Ras Asir-Socotra Strait'',&lt;ref&gt;Science and technology for a new oceans decade: proceedings, Volume 1, p 1248, Marine Technology Society - 1990, University of California&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Cape Guardafui Strait'',&lt;ref&gt;Straits in International Navigation - Page 25, Kleng Lian Koh - 1982&lt;/ref&gt; the Guardafui-Socotra Channel&lt;ref&gt;Nature - Page 686, Sir James Hopwood Jeans, Sir Norman Lockyer - 1928&lt;/ref&gt; Guardafui Channel&lt;ref&gt;World War II Sea War, Vol 7: The Allies Strike Back - Page 23, Don Kindell - 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Cape Guardafui Channel,&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Indian Navy, 1612-1950 - Page 114, D. J. Hastings - 1988&lt;/ref&gt; ''Socotra Strait'',&lt;ref&gt;Seasonal and interannual variations of the nitrogen cycle, T Rixen - 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Socotra Passage''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl K. Turekian - 2009, Ocean Currents: A Derivative of the Encyclopedia of Ocean Sciences, p 160&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The oceanic strait has been regarded as a possibly dangerous pitfall both during peace and war times. It was a highly strategic region during World War Two. Due to its possession by an Axis power at the time, Italy, The Allies attempted to secure passage through the oceanic strait in the Operation of Dante and Guardafui. Subsequently, the Allies decided that in order to continue routing independent ships and convoys, air cover was needed.&lt;ref&gt;The Royal Indian Navy, 1612-1950 - Page 114, D. J. Hastings&lt;/ref&gt; The oceanic strait also experiences cyclones that emerge from its southeast in the Indian ocean.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2018/05/25/Yemen-declares-disaster-after-Cyclone-Mekunu-Oman-in-path-next/7081527247932/&lt;/ref&gt; There is a dispute between the Somali government and Yemen over the sovereignty of its islands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yemenpost.net/Detail123456789.aspx?ID=3&amp;SubID=2698&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of an archipelago has also meant that there are shores for stranded sailors to find shelter, which on occasion has subsequently resulted in their evacuations.&lt;ref&gt;https://indiablooms.com/news-details/N/40457/navy-rescues-indian-nationals-stranded-in-socotra-islands-for-10-days.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
To the northwest, it connects with the Gulf of Aden, to the northeast with the [[Arabian Sea]] and to the south with the Indian ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Fleitmann, Dominik, et al. "Holocene ITCZ and Indian monsoon dynamics recorded in stalagmites from Oman and Yemen (Socotra)." Quaternary Science Reviews 26.1-2 (2007): 170-188.&lt;/ref&gt; The passage contains the islands of [[Abd al Kuri]], [[Darsah]] and [[Samhah]]. Ships passing the strait use the Francesco Crispi lighthouse in [[Cape Guardafui]] as a navigational aid.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Michèle. "Virginia Woolf's Research for Empire and Commerce in Africa (Leonard Woolf, 1920)." Woolf Studies Annual 19 (2013): 83.&lt;/ref&gt; On the western mainland on the Horn African coast, lie the [[Puntite]] localities of [[Alula, Somalia|Aluula]], [[Ras Filuk]], [[Cape Guardafui]], [[Bereeda]], [[Tohen]] and [[Bargal]].&lt;ref&gt;Findlater, J. "Observational aspects of the low-level cross-equatorial jet stream of the western Indian Ocean." Monsoon Dynamics. Birkhäuser, Basel, 1978. 1251-1262.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geology===
The northern reaches of the Guardafui Channel lies at the Gulf of Aden [[Oligocene]] - [[Miocene]] oceanic floor; here water depths reach in excess of 2500&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;Birse, A. C. R., et al. "The Mesozoic and Early Tertiary tectonic evolution of the Socotra area, eastern Gulf of Aden, Yemen." Marine and Petroleum Geology 14.6 (1997): 675-684.&lt;/ref&gt; The Guardafui Channel, as well as the island chain of the Socotra archipelago are located in the [[Somali Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;Khanna, S. N., and G. E. Pillay. "Geology And Petroleum Prospects of Seychelles." (1988): 114-124.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Høje Gladsaxe''' (in [[English language|English]]: ''Tall Happysissors'') is a large [[housing project]], approximately 10&amp;nbsp;km northwest of central [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. The project contains five 15-storey blocks, two 8-storey blocks and some smaller blocks. It contains around 2,500 apartments. The project was finished in 1966. Today about 60–70% of the inhabitants are either immigrants or Danes with immigrant parents.

{{About|a region|the proposed language family|Indo-Pacific language family|the Australian rail service|Indian Pacific}}
[[Image:Indo-Pacific biogeographic region map-en.png|right|thumb|300px|Area covered by the Indo-Pacific biogeographic region]]
The '''Indo-Pacific''', sometimes known as the '''Indo-West Pacific''' or '''Indo-Pacific Asia''', is a [[biogeography|biogeographic]] region of [[Earth]]'s seas, comprising the tropical waters of the [[Indian Ocean]], the western and central [[Pacific Ocean]], and the seas connecting the two in the general area of [[Indonesia]]. It does not include the temperate and polar regions of the Indian and Pacific oceans, nor the [[Tropical Eastern Pacific]], along the Pacific coast of the [[Americas]], which is also a distinct [[marine realm]].

The term is especially useful in [[marine biology]], [[ichthyology]], and similar fields, since many marine [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]] are continuously connected from [[Madagascar]] to [[Japan]] and [[Oceania ecozone|Oceania]], and a number of species occur over that range, but are not found in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].

The region has an exceptionally high [[species richness]], including 3000 species of fish, compared with around 1200 in the next richest marine region, the Western Atlantic, and around 500 species of [[coral reef|reef building]] corals, compared with about 50 species in the Western Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;Helfman G., Collette B., &amp; Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, pp 274-276, 1997, {{ISBN|0-86542-256-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdivisions==
The [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and [[The Nature Conservancy|Nature Conservancy]] divide the Indo-Pacific into three realms (or subrealms), and each of these into a number of marine provinces.

===Central Indo-Pacific===
The [[Central Indo-Pacific]] includes the numerous seas and straits connecting the Indian and Pacific oceans, including the seas surrounding the [[Indonesian archipelago]] (with the exception of [[Sumatra]]'s northwest coast, which is part of the Western Indo-Pacific), the [[South China Sea]], the [[Philippine Sea]], the north coast of [[Australia]], and the seas surrounding [[New Guinea]], western and central [[Micronesia]], [[New Caledonia]], the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]], [[Fiji]], and [[Tonga]]. The Central Indo-Pacific, due in part to its central location at the meeting of two oceans, has the greatest diversity of [[coral]]s and [[mangrove]]s.

===Eastern Indo-Pacific===
The Eastern Indo-Pacific surrounds the mostly volcanic islands of the central Pacific Ocean, extending from the [[Marshall Islands]] through central and southeastern [[Polynesia]] to [[Easter Island]] and [[Hawaii]].

===Western Indo-Pacific===
The [[Western Indo-Pacific]] covers the western and central portion of the Indian Ocean, including Africa's east coast, the [[Red Sea]], [[Gulf of Aden]], [[Persian Gulf]], [[Arabian Sea]], [[Bay of Bengal]], and [[Andaman Sea]], as well as the coastal waters surrounding [[Madagascar]], the [[Seychelles]], [[Comoros]], [[Mascarene Islands]], [[Maldives]], and [[Chagos Archipelago]].

== Economic region ==
With the rising involvement of US in the new growth areas of Asia, the idea of the Indo-Pacific Economic Corridor was conceptualized during the US-India Strategic Dialogue of 2013, where Secretary of State John Kerry referred to the potential of the Indo-Pacific Economic Corridor, in transforming the prospects for development and investments as well as for trade and transit between the economies of South and Southeast Asia Indo-Pacific economic corridor. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orfonline.org/research/indo-pacific-economic-corridor-a-vision-in-progress/|title=Indo-Pacific economic corridor: A vision in progress|author=Sundararaman, Shankari|date=February 10, 2017|publisher=Observer Research Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

YHome in his scholarly study has mapped out the potential for various emerging trans-regional corridors in Asia along with the challenges of linking IPEC into the larger web of regional economic integration initiatives taking shape in the region in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cf.orfonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/GP-ORF-Transregional-Corridors.pdf|title=Emerging Trans-Regional Corridors: South and Southeast Asia|last1=Yhome|first1=K.|last2=Chaturvedy|first2=Rajeev Ranjan|date=2017|publisher=Observer Research Foundation|isbn=978-81-86818-26-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategic/geopolitical context ==
Since 2011, the term ‘Indo-Pacific’ is being used increasingly in the global strategic/ geo-political discourse. So, in its way, the term "Indo-Pacific" can be thought of in the same way as using terms like "Post-Rock" or "World Fusion." The term was first used in an article authored by Gurpreet Khurana, which was carried in the January 2007 issue of the ''Strategic Analysis'' journal (Routledge/ IDSA) titled "Security of Sea Lines: Prospects for India-Japan Cooperation". In the article, the term ‘Indo-Pacific’ refers to the maritime space stretching from the littorals of East Africa and West Asia, across the Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean, to the littorals of East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Khurana, Gurpreet S. , (2007) 'Security of Sea Lines: Prospects for India-Japan Cooperation', Strategic Analysis, Volume 31, No. 1, pp. 139–153&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit of the term was picked up by Japan's Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]], as reflected in his speech to the [[Indian Parliament]] in August 2007 that talked about the "Confluence of the Indian and Pacific Oceans" as "the dynamic coupling as seas of freedom and of prosperity" in the "broader Asia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/pmv0708/speech-2.html|title=Confluence of the Two Seas|date=August 22, 2007|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs Japan|quote=Speech by H.E. Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan at the Parliament of the Republic of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orfonline.org/initiatives/maritime-studies/|title=Maritime Policy Archives - ORF|author=|date=|website=ORF}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2010 onwards, the term Indo-Pacific acquired salience within the Indian government and has since been used often by India's apex political leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, David (2012) "India and the Allure of the 'Indo-Pacific'", International Studies, 49(3&amp;4), pp. 1–24, Sage Publications, London&lt;/ref&gt; From about 2011 onwards, the term has been used frequently by strategic analysts and high-level government/ military leadership in Australia, Japan and the US to denote said region. However, a formal/ official documented articulation of the term first appeared in Australia’s Defence White Paper, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;''Defending Australia and its National Interests'', Defence White Paper 2013, Department of Defence, Australian Government, May 13&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the concept of the Indo-Pacific may lead to a change in popular "mental maps" of how the world is understood in strategic terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web||url=https://www.academia.edu/7697999/Dividing_Lines_Evolving_Mental_Maps_of_the_Bay_of_Bengal|author= Brewster, David|title=Dividing Lines: Evolving Mental Maps of the Bay of Bengal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lately, US officials have begun using the term "Indo-Asia Pacific".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=119243|title=Locklear Calls for Indo-Asia-Pacific Cooperation|author=Miles, Donna|date=8 February 2013|publisher=U.S. Department of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will enable America to maintain its geographic inclusiveness in the new coinage of 'Indo-Pacific'.

The term's profile was raised when it found mention in the joint statement issued by the Indian Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] and United States President [[Donald Trump]] after the former's state visit to the White House on 26 June 2017. "As responsible stewards in the Indo-Pacific region, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi agreed that a close partnership between the United States and India is central to peace and stability in the region. In marking 70 years of diplomatic relations between India and the United States, the leaders resolved to expand and deepen the strategic partnership between the countries and advance common objectives. Above all, these objectives include combatting terrorist threats, promoting stability across the Indo-Pacific region, increasing free and fair trade, and strengthening energy linkages". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mea.gov.in/bilateral-documents.htm?dtl/28560/United_States_and_India_Prosperity_Through_Partnership|title=Joint Statement - United States and India: Prosperity Through Partnership|date=27 June 2017|publisher=Ministry of External Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11960">An '''internationalized country code top-level domain'''  is a [[top-level domain]] in the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) of the [[Internet]].  IDN ccTLDs are specially encoded domain names that are displayed in an end user application, such as a [[web browser]], in their language-native script or [[alphabet]], such as the [[Arabic alphabet]], or a non-alphabetic [[writing system]], such as [[Chinese character]]s. IDN ccTLDs are an application of the [[internationalized domain name]] system to top-level Internet domains assigned to countries, or independent geographic regions.

Although the domain class uses the term ''code'', some of these ccTLDs are not codes but full words. For example, السعودية ''(as-Suʻūdiyya)'' is not an abbreviation of "Saudi Arabia", but the common short-form name of the country in [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]].

Countries with internationalized ccTLDs also retain their traditional ASCII-based ccTLDs.

As of August 2018 there are 59 approved internationalized country code top-level domains, of them at least 47 used. The most used are [[.рф]] (Russia) with over 900,000 domains names, [[.台灣]] (Taiwan) with around 500,000 and [[.中国]] (China) with over 200,000 domains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurid.eu/files/publ/IDNWorldReport2014_Interactive.pdf World report on Internationalised Domain Names 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210151244/http://www.eurid.eu/files/publ/IDNWorldReport2014_Interactive.pdf |date=2014-12-10 }} page 94&lt;/ref&gt; Still as of 2018 around 20 countries using non-latin script do not have an internationalized country code top-level domain, including [[Israel]] and [[Japan]].

==History==
The [[ICANN]] board approved the establishment of an internationalized top-level domain name working group within the [[Country Code Names Supporting Organization]] (ccNSO) in December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proposed Final Implementation Plan for IDN ccTLD Fast Track Process |url=http://ccnso.icann.org/workinggroups/idnc-wg-board-proposal-25jun08.pdf |format=PDF |date=2009-09-30 |publisher=[[ICANN]] |accessdate=2009-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They resolved in June 2007 ''[[inter alia]]'' to proceed and asked the IDNC Working Group to prepare a proposal, which the group delivered in June 2008, "to recommend mechanisms to introduce a limited number of non-contentious IDN ccTLDs, associated with the ISO 3166-1 two-letter codes in a short time frame to meet near term demand." The group proposed a methodology using ICANN's Fast Track Process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icann.org/en/topics/idn/fast-track/ |title=IDN ccTLD Fast Track Process |publisher=[[ICANN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the ICANN charter to work with the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] 
# Identify technical basis of the TLD strings and country code specific processes, select IDN ccTLD personnel and authorities, and prepare documentation;
# Perform ICANN due diligence process for technical proposal and publish method;
# Enter delegation process within established IANA procedures.

In October 2009, [[ICANN]] resolved to start accepting applications for top-level [[internationalized domain name]]s from representatives of countries and territories in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=ICANN Bringing the Languages of the World to the Global Internet|url=http://www.icann.org/en/announcements/announcement-30oct09-en.htm|date=30 October 2009|publisher=Internet Corporation For Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)|accessdate=30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting 16 November 2009, nations and territories could apply for IDN ccTLDs.&lt;ref name=BBC-200910&gt;{{cite news |title=Internet addresses set for change |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8333194.stm |date=2009-10-30 |work=[[BBC News Online]] |accessdate=2009-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and the [[Russian Federation]] were among the first countries to apply for the new internationalized domain name country code top-level domains.  In January 2010 ICANN announced that these countries' IDN ccTLDs were the first four new IDN ccTLDs to have passed the Fast Track String Evaluation within the domain application process.&lt;ref name="ICANN-2010-01-21"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://icann.org/en/announcements/announcement-21jan10-en.htm |title=First IDN ccTLDs Requests Successfully Pass String Evaluation |date=2010-01-21 |publisher=[[ICANN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2010, twenty-one different countries representing eleven languages, including Chinese, [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[Thai language|Thai]], had requested new IDN country codes.&lt;ref name="historic day" /&gt;

On 5 May 2010, the first implementations, all in the [[Arabic alphabet]], were activated.&lt;ref name="ICANN-2010-05-05"&gt;{{cite press release |title=First IDN ccTLDs now available |url=http://blog.icann.org/2010/05/idn-cctlds/ |date=May 5, 2010 |publisher=[[ICANN]] |accessdate=2010-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt was assigned the [[مصر.]] country code, Saudi Arabia [[السعودية.]], and the United Arab Emirates [[امارات.]], (all reading right to left as is customary in Arabic).&lt;ref name="historic day" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ICANN-2010-05-05"/&gt;  ICANN CEO [[Rod Beckstrom]] described the launch as "historic" and "a seismic shift that will forever change the online landscape."&lt;ref name="internet gets international"&gt;{{cite news|title=The internet gets international with the arrival of non-Latin Domain Names|agency=Relaxnews|work=The Independent|date=May 7, 2010|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-internet-gets-international-with-the-arrival-of-nonlatin-domain-names-1967712.html|accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This is the beginning of a transition that will make the Internet more accessible and user friendly to millions around the globe, regardless of where they live or what language they speak," he added.&lt;ref name="internet gets international" /&gt;  Senior director for internationalised domain names Tina Dam said it was "the most significant day" since the launch of the Internet.&lt;ref name="historic day" /&gt;  According to ICANN, Arabic was chosen for the initial roll out because it is one of the most widely used non-Latin languages on the Internet.&lt;ref name="internet gets international" /&gt; There are problems entering a mixed left-to-right and right-to-left text string on a keyboard, making fully Arabic web addresses extra useful.

{{As of|June 2010}}, four such TLDs have been implemented: three using the Arabic alphabet, &lt;code&gt;[[السعودية.]]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;[[مصر.]]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[امارات.]]&lt;/code&gt; (for [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]], respectively), and one using [[Cyrillic]], &lt;code&gt;[[.рф]]&lt;/code&gt; (for [[Russia]]). Five new IDN ccTLDs using Chinese characters were approved in June 2010:
&lt;code&gt;[[.中国]]&lt;/code&gt; with variant &lt;code&gt;[[.中國]]&lt;/code&gt; (for [[mainland China]]), &lt;code&gt;[[.香港]]&lt;/code&gt; (for [[Hong Kong]]), and {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;[[.台灣]]&lt;/code&gt;}} with variant {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;[[.台湾]]&lt;/code&gt;}} (for [[Taiwan]]).&lt;ref name="CW-Sayer"&gt;{{cite news |author=Peter Sayer |title=Chinese language top-level domains win ICANN approval |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9178525/Chinese_language_top_level_domains_win_ICANN_approval |work=[[Computerworld]] |date=June 25, 2010 |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ICANN-Minutes-20100625"&gt;{{cite web |title=Adopted Board Resolutions — Brussels – 25 June 2010 |url=http://www.icann.org/en/minutes/resolutions-25jun10-en.htm |publisher=[[ICANN]] |accessdate=June 26, 2010}} (Note: In these minutes, the encodings of the two CNNIC-delegated ccTLDs have inadvertently been swapped.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The dual domains delegated to each of CNNIC and TWNIC are synonymous, being purely [[orthographical]] variations differing only in using [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified forms]] ([[w:国|国]] and [[w:湾|湾]]), as preferred in [[mainland China]], versus [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional forms]] of the same characters ([[w:國|國]] and [[w:灣|灣]]), as used in [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Implementation Plan of .中国 (xn--fiqs8S) and .中國 (xn--fiqz9S) |url=http://www.cnnic.cn/html/Dir/2010/06/12/5852.htm |publisher=CNNIC |date=June 12, 2010 |accessdate=June 26, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614004813/http://www.cnnic.cn/html/Dir/2010/06/12/5852.htm |archivedate=June 14, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TWNIC's Registration Policy and Technical Solution for the .台灣 and .台湾 IDN ccTLDs |url=http://www.twnic.net/english/dn/dn_07a.htm |publisher=TWNIC |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ukrainian string [[.укр]] was approved by the ICANN Board on 28 February 2013. The zone was added to the root servers on March 19, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=.УКР is going live |url=http://habrahabr.ru/post/173717/ |publisher=Habr |date=March 21, 2013 |accessdate=March 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Bulgarian string [[.бг]] was approved by the ICANN Board in 2014, and the Greek [[.ελ]] string in 2015, both after controversies about possibilities of confusion with existing latin strings.
India has applied for top-level domains in each of its local scripts, at first seven, later eight more. The first one, [[.भारत]], was approved 2011 and became active in 2014. The general flow of applications has ceased after 2016. 

The '''Pakistan''' string '''پاکستان.''' was approved by the '''ICANN BOARD''' on 7th January 2011 to represent Pakistan in Arabic Script. On 4th February 2017, '''IDN CCTLD''' پاکستان. Delegated to '''National Telecommunication Corporation''' and the zone was added to the root servers on February 15, 2017.

[[File:Exploration of Florida by Ribault and Laudonniere 1564 by Le Moyne de Morgues.jpg|thumb|Exploration of Florida by Ribault and Laudonniere, 1564, by [[Le Moyne de Morgues]].]]

'''Jacques le Moyne de Morgues''' ({{circa}}&amp;nbsp;1533–1588) was a [[French people|French]] artist and member of [[Jean Ribault]]'s expedition to the [[New World]]. His depictions of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] life and culture, colonial life, and plants are of extraordinary historical importance.

==Biography==
Until well into the 20th century, knowledge of Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues was extremely limited, and largely confined to the footnotes of inaccessible ethnographic bibliographies, where he figures as the writer and illustrator of a short history of [[René Goulaine de Laudonnière|Laudonniere's]] attempt in 1564-5 to establish a [[Huguenot]] settlement in Florida. In 1922, however, Spencer Savage, librarian of the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]], made a discovery that opened the way to the subsequent definition of Le Moyne as an artistic personality; he recognized that a group of fifty-nine watercolors of plants contained in a small volume, purchased by the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 1856 solely for its fine sixteenth-century French binding, were in fact by Le Moyne. Savage's publications relating to this discovery prepared the way for subsequent attribution to the artist of other important groups of drawings and watercolors, which form the core of his known oeuvre.

=== Early life ===
Le Moyne was born about 1533, in Morgues, some 7 miles east of Châteaudun, in the Loire Valley, France. The first thirty years of his life are undocumented, but it seems reasonable to suppose that he trained as an artist in his native town, which was at the time a notable center both for cartography and for illumination. Le Moyne probably worked at the court of King [[Charles IX of France]], although there is no documentary record to that effect, nor are there any surviving works by the artist dating from before his departure for Florida in 1564.

=== Expedition to Florida ===
Le Moyne accompanied the French expedition of [[Jean Ribault]] and [[René Goulaine de Laudonnière|René Laudonnière]] in an ill-fated attempt to colonize northern [[Florida]].  They arrived at the [[St. Johns River]] in 1564, and soon founded [[Fort Caroline]] near present-day Jacksonville.&lt;ref&gt;(1997) ''The Encyclopedia of American Facts and Dates 10th Edition'', Collins. {{ISBN|0-06-270192-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Painting in the Calvinist style, he is mostly known for his artistic depictions of the landscape, flora, fauna, and, most importantly, the inhabitants of the [[New World]]. His drawings of the cultures commonly referred to as the [[Timucua]] (known through their reproduction by the Dutch publisher [[Theodor de Bry]]) are largely regarded as some of the most accessible data about the cultures of the Southeastern Coastal United States; however, many of these depictions and maps are currently being questioned by historians and archaeologists as to their authenticity. During this expedition he became known as a cartographer and an illustrator as he painted landscapes and reliefs of the land they crossed.

Ribault explored the mouth of the [[St. Johns River]] in [[Florida]] and erected a stone monument there before leading the party north and establishing an outpost of two dozen or so soldiers on [[Parris Island, South Carolina]]. He then sailed back to France for supplies and settlers. However, he was not able to reinforce the fort because while he had been gone, civil war had broken out in France. A truce in 1564 allowed Laudonniere to lead a new expedition, which founded [[Fort Caroline]] on the St. Johns Bluff in what is now [[Jacksonville]]. Many of the DeBry engravings depict the French fort and the local [[Saturiwa]] tribe, the [[Timucua]] group who lived at the mouth of the St. Johns in the area of Fort Caroline. Le Moyne also accompanied several inland expeditions from Ft. Caroline, and he made illustrations of many of the scenes he witnessed.

Laudonniere's expedition, though resulting in the production of the fascinating Le Moyne/de Bry publication and an important map of the coastal regions of Florida, was ultimately a disaster; the good relations initially established with the Indian tribes inhabiting the territories around the settlement site at St. Johns soon soured, in addition to which various members of the French party became disaffected, and revolted against their leaders.

The final coup de grâce came a year later, when a Spanish force from the Spanish colony of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] thirty miles to the south, attacked Laudonniere's stronghold at Fort Caroline. The Spanish, under the leadership of [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]], stormed the colony and killed most of the Huguenots, though Laudonnière, Le Moyne and about two dozen others escaped and were eventually rescued to England. Having lost their way on the return, they sailed half starved into Swansea Bay, England in mid-November 1565, and finally reached Paris early in 1566.

Le Moyne's highly important account of this transatlantic voyage, known today from a Latin edition published in [[Frankfurt]] in 1591 by Theodore de Bry under the title 'Brevis narratio eorum quae in Florida Americai provincia Gallis acciderunt,' clearly indicates that it was the King who instructed the artist to accompany the expedition, headed by Jean Ribault and Rene Goulaine de Laudonniere, as official recording artist and cartographer. Although only one original drawing by Le Moyne of an American subject is known today—the depiction of 'Athore showing Laudonniere the Marker Column set up by Ribault,' executed in watercolor and gouache on vellum, now in the New York Public Library—the 'Brevis narratio,' published by de Bry as the second volume of his great series of publications on voyages to the New World, contains forty-two engraved illustrations and maps alleged to have been made on the spot by Le Moyne. The text by de Bry describes and analyses these images, and his book constitutes a major landmark in the literature of the early exploration of the Americas.

=== Later life ===
Le Moyne fled France after the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of [[Huguenots]] in 1572, ultimately settling in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hulton|first=Paul|date=1962|title=An Album of Plant Drawings by Jacques le Moyne de Morgues|jstor=4422769|journal=The British Museum Quarterly|volume=26|issue=1/2|pages=37–39|doi=10.2307/4422769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Moyne ended his career as a highly regarded botanical artist in Elizabethan London, where his patrons included [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] and Lady [[Mary Sidney]].

==Drawings and authenticity==

All but one of Le Moyne's original drawings were reportedly destroyed in the Spanish attack on Fort Caroline; most the images attributed to him are actually [[engraving]]s created by the [[Belgian]] printer and publisher [[Theodor de Bry]], which are based on recreations Le Moyne produced from memory. These reproductions, distributed by Le Moyne in printed volumes, are some of the earliest images of European colonization in the New World to be circulated. Le Moyne died in London in 1588, and his detailed account of the voyage, ''Brevis narratio eorum quae in Florida Americai provincia Gallis acciderunt'', was published in 1591. A re-edition of his paintings including critical response has been published in 1977 by the [[British Museum]].

The images of the [[Timucua]] and related maps, said to be based on Le Moyne's drawings by de Bry, have fallen under intense scrutiny and their legitimacy as works related to Le Moyne are considered very questionable. Jerald Milanich, author of books on the Timucua and an archaeologist at the Florida Museum of Natural History has published an article in which he questions whether Le Moyne produced drawings of the Timucua at all, based on the unexplainable lack of any definite documentation or evidence. The one existing painting believed to be by Le Moyne himself (owned by the New York Public Library) has been argued to be a replica of one of de Bry's etchings, rather than a source for it, by anthropologist and ethnohistorian [[Christian Feest]].&lt;ref&gt;See: Milanich, Jerald, "The Devil in the Details", Archaeology, May/June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Botanical paintings==
The six documented works by the artist in private hands are exquisite gouaches which embody and combine in a most original manner three diverse artistic traditions: the first is that of manuscript illumination in Le Moyne's native France; the second is the recording of exotic and native flora, fauna and cultures, which was the artistic expression of the late sixteenth-century fascination with exploration and scientific investigation; and the third is the purely aesthetic love of flowers and gardens which was so apparent in Elizabethan court culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aradergalleries.com/artist.php?id=60 |title=Lemoyne De Morgues, Jacques |publisher=Aradergalleries.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406060457/http://www.aradergalleries.com/artist.php?id=60 |archivedate=2012-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Moyne's work represents a transition from the medieval focus on the religious symbolism of plants in art to a Renaissance emphasis on scientific inquiry and beauty when creating botanical illustration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/364533|title=Jacques Le Moyne de Morgues {{!}} A Sheet of Studies of Flowers: A Rose, a Heartsease, a Sweet Pea, a Garden Pea, and a Lax-flowered Orchid {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The most extravagant and exquisitely wrought of all Le Moyne's floral works are the six miniature-like gouaches from the Korner collection. Purchased as the work of an anonymous Netherlandish artist of circa 1600, their authorship was recognized by art historians Dr. Rosy Schilling and Mr. Paul Hutton, by comparison with the drawings by Le Moyne in the British Museum. These are generally similar in conception to the watercolors in the British Museum, and must also date from around 1585.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.17.html/2006/old-master-drawings-l06040|title=le moyne de morgues, {{!}}{{!}}{{!}} old master drawings {{!}}{{!}}{{!}} sotheby's l06040lot3cxknen|website=www.sothebys.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6707">[[Image:Mace bearer Liberation Day 2008 Jersey.jpg|thumb|The Deputy Viscount bearing the Royal Mace in 2008]]

The '''Viscount of Jersey''' ({{lang-fr|Vicomte de Jersey}}) has, since the 14th century, been the chief executive officer of the Royal Court of Jersey. Since 1930, court services have been provided by the Viscount's Department ({{lang-fr|Département du Vicomte}})&lt;ref&gt;“Loi (1930) constituant Le Département du Vicomte”&lt;/ref&gt; in conjunction with the [[Greffier|Judicial Greffe]]. Until 1973 the Viscount was appointed by [[the Crown]]; since 1973 Viscounts have been appointed by the [[Bailiff of Jersey]].

The principal function of the Viscount (also referred to in [[Channel Island English]] by the [[Jersey Legal French]] title of the ''Vicomte'') is the execution of the orders of the courts of [[Jersey]]. This involves managing fines, [[bail]] monies, seizures, confiscations, evictions, service of process, arrests for non-appearance in court and other enforcement procedures.

The Viscount manages [[jury selection]] and exemption, financial assistance to jury members and acts as ''surveillant'' for the jury.

The Viscount also acts as [[coroner]] to deal with matters relating to sudden or unexpected death, and administers estates of deceased persons.&lt;ref&gt;Inquests and Post-mortem Examinations (Jersey) Law 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Departments of the Judiciary and the Legislature (Jersey) Law 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of [[insolvency]], the Viscount administers ''en désastre'' proceedings.

The Viscount is amongst those who act as ''autorisé'' ([[returning officer]]) for [[elections in Jersey]].

The Viscount acts as [[mace-bearer]] for the Bailiff of Jersey in the [[States of Jersey]] and the Royal Court of Jersey, and carries out other ceremonial functions.

==History==

The Viscount carried out other functions historically: till 1885 the Public Markets were under his control. He was Comptroller of Weights and Measures and a member of the Prison Board. He read aloud Royal Proclamations in the Royal Square. A notable action of the Viscount during the exile in Jersey of [[Charles II of England|Charles, Prince of Wales]], was the proclamation in the Royal Square of the Prince as King, following the execution of his father.&lt;ref&gt;''Balleine's History of Jersey'', Marguerite Syvret and Joan Stevens (1998) {{ISBN|1-86077-065-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1842 the Viscount was a member of the States of Jersey with a right to speak but not to vote. From 1842 until 1948 the Viscount sat as a member of the States without speaking or voting rights. The constitutional reform of 1948 removed the Viscount's membership of the legislature but the Viscount's Department continues to be represented at meetings of the States for the provision of executive services.

The Biographical Dictionary of [[Jersey]] by Balleine says: &lt;blockquote&gt;
VISCOUNT. ''Vicomte''. In ancient [[France]] a very high dignitary, the Vice-Count, who took the place of the Count or Duke, when absent. Later in [[Normandy]] a Viscount was appointed over each county, the Viscount of the Cotentin, the Viscount of the Avranchin, etc. A charter of 1179 shows the Viscount holding the King's Court in [[Guernsey]]. In time the dignity of the name was forgotten, and the Viscount became a mere Court official. By the 14th century the Viscount in Jersey was the chief executive officer of the Court, appointed by the Crown to see that orders of the Court were carried out, to issue summonses, to make arrests, to keep prisoners in custody, to abate nuisances, to deliver seisin 'by the Viscount's rod'. He also acted as Coroner, and till 1885 the Public Markets were under his control. He read aloud Royal Proclamations in the Royal Square, was Comptroller of Weights and Measures and a member of the Prison Board.

The DST column shows the months in which Daylight Saving Time, a.k.a. Summer Time, begins and ends. A blank DST box usually indicates that the location stays on Standard Time all year, although in some cases the location stays on Summer Time all year. If a location is currently on DST, add one hour to the time in the Time column.

&lt;br/&gt;{{Horizontal TOC|nonum=YES}}

==Ducks, geese, and waterfowl==
'''Order''': [[Anseriformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Anatidae]]

Anatidae includes the [[duck]]s and most duck-like waterfowl, such as [[Goose|geese]] and [[swan]]s. These birds are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet, flattened bills, and feathers that are excellent at shedding water due to an oily coating.

*[[West Indian whistling-duck]], ''Dendrocygna arborea'' (A)
*[[Fulvous whistling-duck]], ''Dendrocygna bicolor''
*[[Snow goose]], ''Anser caerulescens'' (A)
*[[Wood duck]], ''Aix sponsa''
*[[Blue-winged teal]], ''Spatula discors''
*[[Northern shoveler]], ''Spatula clypeata''
*[[Eurasian wigeon]], ''Mareca penelope'' (A)
*[[American wigeon]], ''Mareca americana'' (A)
*[[White-cheeked pintail]], ''Anas bahamensis'' (A)
*[[Northern pintail]], ''Anas acuta'' (A)
*[[Green-winged teal]], ''Anas crecca''
*[[Ring-necked duck]], ''Aythya collaris''
*[[Lesser scaup]], ''Aythya affinis'' (A)
*[[Long-tailed duck]], ''Clangula hyemalis'' (A)
*[[Hooded merganser]], ''Lophodytes cucullatus'' (A)
*[[Ruddy duck]], ''Oxyura jamaicensis''

==Guineafowl==
'''Order''': [[Galliformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Numididae]]

Guineafowl are a group of African, seed-eating, ground-nesting birds that resemble partridges, but with featherless heads and spangled grey plumage.

*[[Helmeted guineafowl]], ''Numida meleagris'' (A)

==Flamingos==
'''Order''': [[Phoenicopteriformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Phoenicopteridae]]

[[Flamingo]]s are gregarious wading birds, usually {{convert|3|to|5|ft|m|1}} tall, found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres. Flamingos filter-feed on shellfish and algae. Their oddly shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume and, uniquely, are used upside-down.

*[[American flamingo]], ''Phoenicopterus ruber''

==Grebes==
'''Order''': [[Podicipediformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Podicipedidae]]

[[Grebe]]s are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land.

*[[Pied-billed grebe]], ''Podilymbus podiceps'' (A)

==Pigeons and doves==
'''Order''': [[Columbiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Columbidae]]

[[Pigeon]]s and [[dove]]s are stout-bodied birds with short necks and short slender bills with a fleshy [[cere]].

*[[Rock pigeon]], ''Columba livia'' (I)
*[[Scaly-naped pigeon]], ''Patagioenas squamosa''
*[[White-crowned pigeon]], ''Patagioenas leucocephala'' (A)
*[[Eurasian collared-dove]], ''Streptopelia decaocto'' (I) (A)
*[[Common ground-dove]], ''Columbina passerina''
*[[White-winged dove]], ''Zenaida asiatica ''
*[[Zenaida dove]], ''Zenaida aurita''

==Cuckoos and anis==
'''Order''': [[Cuculiformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Cuculidae]]

The family Cuculidae includes [[cuckoo]]s, [[Geococcyx|roadrunner]]s, and [[Ani (bird)|anis]]. These birds are of variable size with slender bodies, long tails, and strong legs. The Old World cuckoos are [[brood parasite]]s.

*[[Smooth-billed ani]], ''Crotophaga ani''
*[[Yellow-billed cuckoo]], ''Coccyzus americanus'' (A)
*[[Pearly-breasted cuckoo]], ''Coccyzus euleri'' (A)

'''Manbij plain''' ({{lang-ar|سهل منبج}} {{IPA-ar|sæhl ˈmænbid͡ʒ|}}) is a vast plain on the eastern [[Aleppo plateau]] in northern [[Syria]] and southeastern [[Turkey]]. The plain runs along the western bank of river [[Euphrates]] for approximately 140&amp;nbsp;km from [[Nizip]] to [[Maskanah]], with an average width of 15–30&amp;nbsp;km. It is located within the [[Manbij District|Manbij]] and [[Jarabulus District|Jarābulus]] districts of [[Aleppo Governorate]] in Syria, and the Nizip and Karkamış districts of [[Gaziantep Province]] in Turkey.

==Borders and description==
The average elevation of the plain is around 400 m. It gradually slopes up from east to west. The plain can be divided into northern and southern parts. The northern part extends from Nizip to [[Manbij]]. This part is surrounded by the [[Aintab plateau]] from north and west. It is traversed from west to east by the Nizip, [[Merzimen]] (Bozatlı), and [[Sajur]] rivers. It is inhabited by a [[Syrian Turkmen|Turkmen]] density in addition to [[Arab]]s and other ethnic minorities. The Turkmen call this plain ''Barak plain'' after the name of a Turkmen tribe. In Syria it is called the northern Manbij plain.

The southern plain extends from Manbij to Maskanah. It is bounded from west by the [[Dhahab valley]] and [[Lake Jabboul]]. In the south it is joined by the arid steppe of the northern [[Syrian Desert]].

Irrigation based agriculture has been practiced in the plain since ancient times. Archeological remains from the [[paleolithic]] have been discovered in the Sajur valley. The ancient [[Zeugma, Commagene|Zeugma on the Euphrates]] is found in the northern end of the plain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1897">In [[Bangladesh]] and [[Eastern India]] a '''mouza''' or '''mauza''' is a type of administrative district, corresponding to a specific land area within which there may be one or more settlements. Before the 20th century, the term referred to a revenue collection unit in a ''[[pargana]]'' or [[revenue]] district. As populations increased and villages became more common and developed, the concept of the mouza declined in importance. Today it has become mostly [[synonymous]] with the ''gram'' or village. Most [[census]]es and [[Electoral roll|voter lists]], for example, now use the names of villages rather than mouzas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Islam |first=Sirajul |year=2012 |chapter=Mouza |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Mouza |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has a similar meaning in the [[Assam]] region of India, where a mouza is a locality in a district or within a large Assamese city. This term should not be confused with the term ''Gaon'' (meaning village in [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]]). In Assam, several villages typically form a single mouza. The head of the mouza is known as a [[mouzadar]] or [[mazumdar]]. 

In Santhal Pargana region of Jharkhand, the head of a mouza is called a Mulraiyat or a Pradhan. The office of Mulraiyat or Pradhan is held hereditary and the eldest son gets the office of a deceased Mulraiyat or Pradhan.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

'''Pei Xiu''' (224&amp;ndash;271), [[courtesy name]] '''Jiyan''', was a Chinese politician, geographer, writer, and cartographer of the state of [[Cao Wei]] during the late [[Three Kingdoms]] period and [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] of China. He was very much trusted by [[Sima Zhao]], and participated in the suppression of [[Zhuge Dan]]'s [[Zhuge Dan's Rebellion|rebellion]]. Following [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Sima Yan]] taking the throne of the newly established Jin dynasty, he and [[Jia Chong]] had [[Cao Huan]] deprived of his position to accord to the will of heaven. In the year 267, Pei Xiu was appointed as the Minister of Works in the Jin government.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 538"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 538.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pei Xiu outlined and analysed the advancements of [[cartography]], [[surveying]] and [[Chinese mathematics|mathematics]] up until his time.&lt;ref name="hsu 96"/&gt; He criticised earlier [[Han dynasty]] maps for their lack of precision and quality when representing scale and measured distances, although 20th century archaeological excavations and findings of maps predating the third century prove otherwise. There is also evidence that [[Zhang Heng]] (78&amp;ndash;139) was the first to establish the grid reference system in Chinese cartography.

==As a cartographer==
{{further|History of cartography#China}}
[[File:Western Han Mawangdui Silk Map.JPG|thumb|An early [[Han dynasty|Western Han dynasty]] (202 BCE &amp;ndash; 9 CE) [[silk]] map found in tomb 3 of [[Mawangdui|Mawangdui Han tombs site]], depicting the Kingdom of [[Changsha]] and Kingdom of [[Nanyue]] in southern China (note: the south direction is oriented at the top, north at the bottom).]]

Pei Xiu is best known for his work in [[cartography]]. Although professional map-making and use of the grid had [[History of cartography#China|existed in China before]] him,&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 106 107"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 106&amp;ndash;107.&lt;/ref&gt; he was the first to mention a plotted geometrical [[grid reference]] and graduated scale displayed on the surface of maps to gain greater accuracy in the estimated distance between different locations.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 538 540"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 538&amp;ndash;540.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Howard Nelson asserts that there is ample written evidence that Pei Xiu derived the idea of the grid reference from the map of [[Zhang Heng]] (78&amp;ndash;139 CE), a polymath inventor and statesman of the Eastern Han period.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 359.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Temple asserts that Zhang Heng should also be credited as the first to establish the mathematical grid in cartography, as evidenced by his work in maps, the titles of his lost books, and the hint given in the ''[[Book of Later Han]]'' (i.e. Zhang Heng "cast a network of coordinates about heaven and earth, and reckoned on the basis of it").&lt;ref&gt;Temple (1986) 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Xiu also created a set of large-area maps that were drawn to scale. He produced a set of principles that stressed the importance of consistent scaling, directional measurements, and adjustments in land measurements in the terrain that was being mapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures |last=Selin  |first= Helaine  |publisher=Springer |year=2008 |isbn= 978-1402049606 |publication-date=March 17, 2008 |page=567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The preface to Pei Xiu's written work was preserved in the 35th volume of the ''[[Book of Jin]]'',&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 538"/&gt; which is the official history for the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] and one of the [[Twenty-four Histories]]. It was written in the ''Book of Jin'' that Pei Xiu made a critical study of ancient texts in order to update the naming conventions of geographic locations described in old texts.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 538"/&gt; His maps – drawn on rolls of silk – were presented to [[Emperor Wu of Jin|Emperor Wu]], who preserved them in the imperial court's archives.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 538"/&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 541"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 541.&lt;/ref&gt; Pei Xiu's maps have since been lost, decayed or destroyed.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 540"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 540.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the oldest existing terrain maps from China date to the fourth century BCE, found in a [[Qin (state)|Qin]] tomb in present-day [[Gansu]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="hsu 90"&gt;Hsu, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Han dynasty]] maps from the second century BCE were found earlier in the 1973 excavation of [[Mawangdui]].&lt;ref name="hsu 90"/&gt;

In 1697, the [[Qing dynasty]] cartographer Hu Wei (胡渭) reconstructed Pei Xiu's maps in his ''Yugong Zhuizhui'' (禹貢錐指, ''A Few Points on the Vast Subject of the Yu Gong'').&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 540"/&gt; Modern scholars have also used Pei Xiu's writing to reproduce his works, and historians such as Herrmann have compared Pei Xiu to other great ancient cartographers such as the Greek cartographer [[Ptolemy]] (83&amp;ndash;161).&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 540"/&gt;

[[File:Song Dynasty Map.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The ''Yu Ji Tu'', or ''Map of the Tracks of Yu Gong'', carved into stone in 1137,&lt;ref name="Gernet1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacques Gernet|title=A History of Chinese Civilization|date=31 May 1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-49781-7|pages=339–}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in the [[Stele Forest]] of [[Xi'an]]. This three feet squared map features a graduated scale of 100 [[Li (unit)|''li'']] for each rectangular grid. China's coastline and river systems are clearly defined and precisely pinpointed on the map. Yu Gong is in reference to the work of the Chinese deity [[Yu the Great]] described in the [[History of geography#China|geographical chapter]] of the ''[[Book of Documents]]'', dated fifth century BCE.]]

Pei Xiu wrote a preface to his maps with essential background information regarding older maps in China. He also provided a great deal of criticism about the existing maps from the [[Han dynasty]] in his time. Later Chinese ideas about the quality of maps made during the Han dynasty and before stem from the assessment given by Pei Xiu, which was not a positive one.&lt;ref name="hsu 96"/&gt; Pei Xiu noted that the extant Han maps at his disposal were of little use since they featured too many inaccuracies and exaggerations in measured distance between locations.&lt;ref name="hsu 96"&gt;Hsu, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Qin maps and Mawangdui maps of the Han dynasty discovered by modern archaeologists were far superior in quality than those examined and criticised by Pei Xiu.&lt;ref name="hsu 96"/&gt; It was not until the 20th century that Pei Xiu's third century assessment of earlier maps' dismal quality would be overturned and disproven. The makers of the Han maps were familiar with the use of scale, while the Qin map makers had pinpointed the course of rivers with some accuracy.&lt;ref name="hsu 97"&gt;Hsu, 97.&lt;/ref&gt; What these earlier maps did not feature was topographical [[elevation]], which Pei Xiu would outline with his six principles of cartography.&lt;ref name="hsu 97"/&gt;

Pei Xiu's preface describes geographers in the [[Xia dynasty|Xia]], [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] dynasties, although the earliest known geographical work was the ''[[Yu Gong]]'' chapter of the ''Shu Ji'' or ''[[Book of Documents]]'', compiled in the fifth century BCE during the mid Zhou period.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 500"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 500.&lt;/ref&gt; Pei Xiu also referred to [[Xiao He]] (died 193), who assembled the maps made during the fall of the [[Qin dynasty]]. This was done after the founder of the [[Han dynasty]], [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]] (died 195 BC), had sacked the city of [[Xianyang]]. Pei Xiu states:

{{blockquote|The origin of maps and geographical treatises goes back into former ages. Under the three dynasties (Xia, Shang and Zhou) there were special officials for this (''guoshi''). Then, when the Han sacked Xianyang, Xiao He collected all the maps and documents of the Qin. Now it is no longer possible to find the old maps in the secret archives, and even those Xiao He found are missing. We only have maps, both general and local, from the (Later) Han time. None of these employs a graduated scale (''fenlü'') and none of them are arranged on a rectangular grid (''zhunwang''). Moreover, none of them gives anything like a complete representation of the celebrated mountains and the great rivers; their arrangement is very rough and imperfect, and one cannot rely on them. Indeed some of them contain absurdities, irrelevancies and exaggerations, which are not in accord with reality, and which should be banished by good sense.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 539"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 539.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pei Xiu continues his preface with short background information on the conquests by the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] and the impressive maps commissioned by [[Sima Zhao]] (211&amp;ndash;264). He then described the methods he used to create new maps while examining the ancient text of the ''Yu Gong'' or ''Tribute of Yu'' to create historical maps:

{{blockquote|The assumption of power by the great Jin dynasty has unified space in all the six directions. To purify its territory, it began with Yong and Shu ([[Gansu]] and [[Sichuan]]) and penetrated deeply into their regions, though full of obstacles. [[Sima Zhao|Emperor Wen]] then ordered the appropriate officials to draw up maps of Wu and Shu. After Shu had been conquered and the maps were examined, with regard to the distances from one another of mountains, rivers, and places, the positions of plains and declivities, and the lines of the roads, whether straight or curved, which the six armies had followed; it was found that there was not the slightest error. Now, referring back to antiquity, I have examined according to the ''Yu Gong'' the mountains and lakes, the courses of the rivers, the plateaus and plains, the slopes and marshes, the limits of the nine ancient provinces and the sixteen modern ones, taking account of [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] and fiefs, prefectures and cities, and not forgetting the names of places where the ancient kingdoms concluded treaties or held meetings; and lastly, inserting the roads, paths and navigable waters, I have made this map in eighteen sheets.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 539"/&gt;}}

Pei Xiu outlined six principles that should be observed when creating a map. He then defended his position and each of the six principles with a short explanation as to how they provide better accuracy in map-making and cartography. The first three principles outlined the use of scale (''fenlü''), direction (''zhunwang'') and road distance (''daoli''), while the last three principles are used to properly calculate distances on uneven terrain as represented on a flat, two dimensional map.&lt;ref name="hsu 96 87"&gt;Hsu, 96&amp;ndash;97.&lt;/ref&gt; Pei Xiu states:

{{blockquote|In making a map there are six observable principles: (1) the graduated divisions, which are the means of determining the map's scale; (2) the rectangular grid (of parallel lines in two dimensions), which is the way of depicting correct relations between various parts of the map; (3) pacing out the sides of right-angled triangles, which is the way of fixing the lengths of derived distances (i.e., the third side of the triangle, which cannot be walked over); (4) (measuring) the high and the low; (5) (measuring) right angles and acute angles; (6) (measuring) curves and straight lines. These three principles are used according to the nature of the terrain, and are the means by which one reduces what are really plains and hills (literally cliffs) to distances on a plane surface... If one draws a map without graduated divisions, there is no means of distinguishing between what is near and what is far. If one has graduated divisions, but no rectangular grid or network of lines, then while one may attain accuracy in one corner of the map, one will certainly lose it elsewhere (i.e. in the middle, far from guiding marks). If one has a rectangular grid, but has not worked upon the [third] principle, then when it is a case of places in difficult country, among mountains, lakes or seas (which cannot be traversed directly by the surveyor), one cannot ascertain how they are related to one another. If one has adopted the [third] principle, but has not taken account of the high and the low, the right angles and acute angles, and the curves and straight lines, then the figures for distances indicated on the paths and roads will be far from the truth, and one will lose the accuracy of the rectangular grid. However, if we examine a map prepared by the combination of all these principles, we find that a true scale representation of the distances is fixed by the graduated divisions. So also the reality of the relative positions is attained by the use of paced sides of right-angled triangles; and the true scale of degrees and figures is reproduced by the determinations of high and low, angular dimensions, and curved or straight lines. Thus even if there are great obstacles in the shape of high mountains or vast lakes, huge distances or strange places, necessitating climbs and descents, retracting of steps or detours — everything can be taken into account and determined. When the principle of the rectangular grid is properly applied, then the straight and the curved, near and the far, can conceal nothing of their form from us.&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 539 540"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 539&amp;ndash;540.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11030">'''Permeability''' or '''connectivity''' describes the extent to which urban forms permit (or restrict) movement of people or vehicles in different directions.  The terms are often used interchangeably, although differentiated definitions also exist (see below).  Permeability is generally considered a positive attribute of an urban design, as it permits ease of movement and avoids severing neighbourhoods.   Urban forms which lack permeability, e.g. those severed by arterial roads, or with many long culs-de-sac, are considered to discourage movement on foot and encourage longer journeys by car.  There is some empirical research evidence to support this view.&lt;ref&gt;HANDY, S., CAO, X. and MOKHTARIAN, P.L., 2005. Correlation or causality between the built environment and travel behavior? Evidence from Northern California. Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 10(6), pp. 427-444.&lt;/ref&gt;

Permeability is a central principle of [[New Urbanism]], which favours urban designs based upon the ‘traditional’ (particularly in a North American context) street grid.  New Urbanist thinking has also influenced Government policy in the United Kingdom, where the ''Department for Transport Guidance Manual for Streets'' says:&lt;ref name ="manual"&gt;[http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/manforstreets/ DFT, 2007. Manual for Streets. London: Thomas Telford Publishing]. Paragraph 4.2.3&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[[Street network]]s should in general be connected.  Connected or ‘permeable’ networks encourage walking and cycling and make places easier to navigate through.}}

== Reservations ==
[[Image:VaubanTraficNetwork-Schematic.png|thumb|A diagramatic depiction of the transportation network in Vauban, Freiburg, Germany. It shows the departure from the traditional simple grid and the adoption of a complex combination grid. This network exemplifies the distinction between connectivity and permeability. The drawing shows the three types of connectors: roads in red, local streets in orange and pedestrian bicycle paths in green]]
[[File:Connectivity versus permeability.svg|right|thumb|A diagrammatic illustration of the distinction between connectivity and permeability: From light gray to dark, streets become less permeable to an increasing number of transport means such as trucks, busses, cars and bikes until only pedestrians have access to the narrowest, steep or stepped streets. Connectivity remains identical. (Drawing based on Stephen Marshall)&lt;ref name=Marshall /&gt;]]
[[File:Unplanned Rideau Street Cul-de-sac.jpg|right|thumb|This cul-de-sac retrofit exemplifies the difference between connectivity and permeability in practice. It was created to improve traffic flow on a major commercial "Main Street" by "filtering" cars out at this junction. Bicycles and pedestrians retain full accessibility]]
There are two principal reservations concerning permeability.  The first relates to [[property crime]].  Although the issue is contested, there is some research evidence to suggest that permeability may be positively correlated with crimes such as burglary.&lt;ref&gt;WHITE, GARLAND F. (1990). "Neighborhood Permeability and Burglary Rates". Justice Quarterly 7(1).&lt;/ref&gt;
New research has expanded the discussion on this disputed issue. A recent study&lt;ref name=study&gt;An evidence based approach to crime and urban design Or, can we have vitality, sustainability and security all at once? Bill Hillier, Ozlem Sahbaz March 2008 Bartlett School of Graduate Studies University College London&lt;/ref&gt; did extensive spatial analysis and correlated several building, site plan and social factors with crime frequencies and identified nuances to the contrasting positions. The study looked at, among others, a) dwelling types, b) unit density (site density) c) movement on the street, d) culs–de-sac or grids and e) the permeability of a residential area. Among its conclusions are, respectively, that a) flats are always safer than houses and the wealth of inhabitants matters; b) density is generally beneficial but more so at ground level; c) local movement is beneficial, larger scale movement not so; d) relative affluence and the number of neighbours has a greater effect than either being on a cul-de-sac or being on a through street. It also re-established that simple, linear culs-de-sac with good numbers of dwellings that are joined to through streets tend to be safe. As for permeability, it suggests that residential areas should be permeable enough to allow movement in all directions but no more. ''The over-provision of poorly used permeability is a crime hazard.''

The second reservation concerns the effects of permeability for private motor vehicles. Melia (2012)&lt;ref name="melia"&gt;[http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/16905/ Melia, S. (2012) Filtered and unfiltered permeability: The European and Anglo-Saxon approaches. Project, 4. pp. 6-9.]&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the terms "unfiltered permeability" and "filtered permeability" to distinguish between the two approaches.

Unfiltered permeability is the view supported by the New Urbanists that urban designs should follow "traditional" or mixed use streets, where pedestrians, cyclists and motor vehicles follow the same routes.  The principal advantage claimed for this approach is that it "leads to a more even spread of motor traffic throughout the area and so avoids the need for distributor roads".&lt;ref name="manual"/&gt;

There are also a range of arguments advanced by the proponents of [[Shared space]] that where speeds are low, road users should be mixed rather than segregated.

== Filtered permeability ==

Filtered permeability is the concept, supported by organisations such as [[Sustrans]], that networks for walking and cycling should be more permeable than the road network for motor vehicles.  This, it is argued will encourage walking and cycling by giving them a more attractive environment free from traffic and a time and convenience advantage over car driving.  Evidence for this view comes from European cities such as [[Freiburg]], and its rail suburb [[Vauban, Freiburg|Vauban]], and [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] which have achieved high levels of walking and cycling by following similar principles, sometimes described as: "a coarse grain for cars and a fine grain for cyclists and pedestrians".&lt;ref name="melia"/&gt; Filtered permeability requires cyclists, pedestrians (and sometimes public transport) to be separated from private motor vehicles in some places, although it can be combined with [[shared space]] solutions, elsewhere in the same town or city. This is the case in Dutch towns such as [[Drachten]].

The principle of filtered permeability was endorsed for the first time in British Government guidance for the eco-towns programme in 2008&lt;ref name="clg"&gt;[http://www.tcpa.org.uk/data/files/etws_transport.pdf Eco-towns Transport Worksheet], 2008. Town &amp; Country Planning Association and Department of Communities and Local Government.&lt;/ref&gt; and later that year by an alliance of 70 organisations concerned with public health, planning and transport in their policy declaration: ''Take Action on Active Travel''.&lt;ref name="adph"&gt;[http://www.adph.org.uk/news.php?PHPSESSID=0gcir94fu4rg4h0gm0sjumr4e6 Take Action on Active Travel], published for the working group by Sustrans, Bristol, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A parallel debate has been occurring in North America, where researchers have proposed and applied the [[Fused Grid]], an urban street network pattern which follows the principles of filtered permeability, to address perceived shortcomings of both the 'traditional' grid and more recent suburban street layouts. A study conducted in Washington State&lt;ref name="frank"&gt;Frank, L and Hawkins C, 2008, Giving Pedestrians an Edge—Using Street Layout to influence transportation choice, Ottawa, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; found that the fused grid was associated with significantly higher levels of walking than the other two alternatives. A recent comparison of seven neighbourhood  layouts found a 43 and 32 percent increase in walking with respect to a conventional suburban and the traditional grid in a [[Fused Grid]] layout, which has greater permeability for pedestrians than for cars due to its inclusion of pedestrian-only paths (filtering). It also showed a 7 to 10 percent range of reduction in driving with respect to the remainder six neighbourhood layouts in the set.&lt;ref&gt;Xiongbing Jin, 2010 Modeling the Influence of Neighbourhood  Design on Daily Trip Patterns in Urban Neighbourhoods, Memorial University of Newfoundland&lt;/ref&gt;

== Permeability and connectivity ==
Stephen Marshall&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;MARSHALL, S., 2005. Streets and Patterns. Spon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has sought to differentiate the concepts of "connectivity" and "permeability" (see drawing).  As defined by Marshall, "connectivity" refers solely to the ''number'' of connections to and from a particular place, whereas "permeability" refers to the ''capacity'' of those connections to carry people or vehicles.

Traffic studies on the influence of street patterns on travel generally overlook this distinction and two metrics are instead used to characterize a street pattern for trip purposes: connectivity and intersection density, both of which refer to regular city streets.  This omission is often the result of unavailability of data for connectors that do not appear on maps and cannot be geo-coded. Consequently, the potential effect of connectors that are accessible only to pedestrians and bicycles on mode choice and extent of travel is missed. The aforementioned study shows that differentiating between normal paved streets and non-vehicular paths yields clear and positive results about the influence of the latter.&lt;ref name=study /&gt;

The distinction between permeability and connectivity becomes clearer in practice. Widening   roads within a network that lead to destinations would increase the network’s permeability, but leave its connectivity unchanged. Conversely, transforming existing streets that are part of a [[grid plan]] into permeable, linked culs-de-sac, as was done in Berkeley, CA and Vancouver, BC, retains their connectivity intact but limits their permeability to pedestrians and bicycles only, while it "filters" out motorized transport.

The '''Pharusian Ocean''' is an ancient ocean that existed from 800 to 635 million years ago, between the break-up of the [[Rodinia]] [[supercontinent]] and the start of formation of the [[Gondwana]] supercontinent.

==Opening and closure==
The Pharusian Ocean opened around 800 million years ago in the [[Neoproterozoic]] era after rifting along the eastern margin of the [[West African craton]] during the breakup of [[Rodinia]].
The ocean began to close around 730 million years ago with eastward subduction of the Tilemsi arc, which was [[Accretion (geology)|accreted]] against the Hoggar region of the [[Saharan Metacraton]].{{sfn|Condie|1992|pp=63}}
The western part of the [[Hoggar]] massif is made of material from the Pharusian Ocean including oceanic basalts, arc volcanic and sedimentary rocks and sediments that were shed into the Pharusian Ocean by the West African craton and the eastern Hoggar.{{sfn|Rogers|Santosh|2004|pp=237}}
Closure was completed when the West African and Saharan cratons collided around 635 million years ago at the start of the [[Pan-African orogeny]].{{sfn|Neves|Neto|Fuck|1999|pp=155–166}}

==Southern extension==
The [[Goiás Ocean]], lying to the southwest between the [[Amazonian craton]] and the [[Congo craton]], extended into the Pharusian Ocean.
The Goiás Ocean closed during the final phases of formation of West [[Gondwana]]. The southern portion of the [[Trans Brazilian Lineament]] (TBL) marks the [[suture zone]] of this closure, while the northern Borborema portion of the TBL and the [[Trans-Saharan Belt]], running from [[Algeria]] to [[Benin]], mark the suture zone of the Pharusian Ocean closure.{{sfn|Hatcher|2007|pp=316}}
These ocean closures and subsequent tectonic events were not simultaneous, but happened over an extended period of time.{{sfn|dos Santos|Fetter|Neto|2008}}
In southwestern central Africa the granulite cooling ages range between 587 and 576 Ma, while in northeast Brazil they range from 568 to 500 Ma.{{sfn|Pankhurst|2008|pp=114}}
However, aeromagnetic and gravity data give evidence of continuity between the TBL [[lineament]], the [[Sobral fault]] in northeastern Brazil, the [[Kandi fault zone]] in [[Benin]] and the Trans-Saharan Belt formed by closure of the Pharusian Ocean.{{sfn|Fairhead|Bournas|Raddadi|2007}}

A number of places in the world, like the places named after places in other parts of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], were named after the [[Channel Islands]], or some place therein. Not all are named directly for one of the islands, but are often named indirectly, such as for another place on the list.

'''''Proteus''''' is a 2013 [[exploration game|exploration]] and [[Adventure game#Walking simulators|walking simulator]] [[video game]] created and designed by Ed Key and David Kanaga for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], [[Linux]], [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Vita]]. It allows the player to freely explore a [[procedural generation|procedurally-generated]] environment, without predetermined goals. The world's flora and fauna emit unique musical signatures, combinations of which cause [[dynamic music|dynamic shifts in audio]], based on the player's surroundings.

The game began development in 2008 under game designer Ed Key, joined by audio designer and composer David Kanaga in 2010. Key first conceived ''Proteus'' as an open-ended role-playing game akin to ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]''; but, because of the work required for such a project, the team redesigned it to be "nontraditional and nonviolent". The PlayStation 3 and Vita versions of ''Proteus'' were developed by [[Curve Studios]], whose team added extra features to the Vita edition at [[Sony]]'s behest.

''Proteus'' won the prize for Best Audio at the 2011 [[Indiecade]] awards, and it was a finalist for the 2012 [[Independent Games Festival]]'s Nuovo Award. Its original and PlayStation releases were well received by critics, who praised the use of audio. However, certain reviewers disliked the game's brevity and limited replayability.

[[File:Memorial in Proteus.png|thumb|left|Areas such as this memorial cause different sounds to play when players are walking near or through them]]
In ''Proteus'', players explore an island from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] perspective. The island is drawn in a [[pixel art]] style and contains hills, trees, structures, and animals such as frogs and rabbits, though the layout is [[Procedural generation|different each time]] the game is played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/5980379/a-gorgeous-digital-world-that-you-can-explore-starting-today |title= A Gorgeous Digital World That You Can Explore Starting Today |date= 30 January 2013 |work= [[Kotaku]] |first= Patricia |last= Hernandez |accessdate= 7 August 2013 |publisher= [[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/06/12/ambient-works-proteus-ep/ |title= Ambient Works: Proteus EP |date= 12 June 2011 |accessdate= 8 August 2013 |first= Jim |last= Rossignol |work= Rock, Paper, Shotgun}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EuroG" /&gt; The focus of the game is on exploration rather than interaction, as there is no narrative and the player is given no instructions on how to proceed.&lt;ref name="GSpot" /&gt; Possible interactions are limited—for example, animals may run away when players come too close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/02/27/the-hills-are-alive-proteus-beta-release/ |title= The Hills Are Alive: Proteus Beta Release |date= 27 February 2012 |first= Adam |last= Smith |accessdate= 8 August 2013 |work= Rock, Paper, Shotgun}}&lt;/ref&gt; The soundtrack changes depending on the player's movements and location; it may fall silent when the player is at the top of a hill and sonically dense as they travel down it. The soundtrack includes additional sounds and notes when the player nears objects or animals.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;

When the game begins, players are situated away from the island and must move across an ocean of water to reach it.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; Upon arrival, players are free to explore the whole island during the initial season of spring. During nighttime, players can enter a cluster of lights to advance time to the next season; going through each until the end of winter, after which the game ends. The landscape changes with the season, such as trees shedding their leaves in autumn.&lt;ref name="EuroG" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/01/30/proteus-review/ |title= Wot I Think: Proteus |date= 30 January 2013 |accessdate= 7 August 2013 |first= John |last= Walker |work= Rock, Paper, Shotgun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these gameplay elements, the [[PlayStation Vita]] version lets the player directly affect the environment with the console's rear touch panel and generate islands based on the current date and location in the real world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-10-23-proteus-rolls-onto-ps3-and-vita-next-week |title= Proteus rolls onto PS3 and Vita next week |date= 29 October 2013 |accessdate= 8 November 2013 |work= [[Gamer Network]] |first= Jeffrey |last= Matulef }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.joystiq.com/2013/10/10/proteus-launching-on-ps3-and-vita-this-month-with-new-world-gene/ |title= Proteus launching on PS3 and Vita this month with new world generation options |first= Mike |last= Suszek |date= 10 October 2013 |accessdate= 8 November 2013 |work= [[Joystiq]] |publisher= [[AOL]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
British game designer Ed Key began work on ''Proteus'' in 2008 during his evenings and weekends, though the game only neared its final form when David Kanaga joined development in 2010.&lt;ref name="Gama"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gamasutra.com/view/news/39419/Road_to_the_IGF_Key_and_Kanagas_Proteus.php |title= Road to the IGF: Key and Kanaga's Proteus |date= 27 January 2012 |accessdate= 6 August 2013 |first= Leigh |last= Alexander |work= [[Gamasutra]] |publisher= [[UBM TechWeb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.techhive.com/article/251236/one_on_one_with_proteus_developer_ed_key.html |title= One-on-One With Proteus Developer Ed Key |date= 4 March 2012 |accessdate= 21 November 2013 |work= Tech Hive |first= Zohra |last= Ashpari |publisher= [[International Data Group|IDG]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key originally envisioned the game as a procedural [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]] in the same vein as ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'', in which the player would visit towns and complete quests. Realizing the extent of the work that would be needed for such a game, the developers decided to instead make something "nontraditional and nonviolent".&lt;ref name="RPSinterview"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/06/26/staying-humble-proteus-origins-and-ed-keys-next-game/#more-157738 |title= Staying Humble: Proteus’ Origins And Ed Key’s Next Game |date= 26 June 2013 |accessdate= 6 August 2013 |first= Nathan |last= Grayson |work= Rock, Paper, Shotgun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key developed the game using a [[game engine]] he had written in the [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] programming language. During and after development the developers expressed interest in allowing player-created mods of the game; some such modified versions of the game have since been created by the community.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.visitproteus.com/forum/index.php?topic=164.0 |title= Proteus Engine |date= 31 January 2013 |accessdate= 21 November 2013 |work= Proteus Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pcgamer.com/purgateus-is-a-dark-remixmod-for-proteus-and-it-looks-fantastic/ |title= Purgateus is a dark remix/mod for Proteus, and it looks fantastic |date= 26 May 2014 |accessdate= 26 December 2014 |first= Tom |last= Sykes |work= PC Gamer}}&lt;/ref&gt; After David Kanaga joined the development team as audio composer, the audio mechanics were refined through the testing of many different ideas, such as allowing players to create their own music within the game. This idea was cut because Key and Kanaga felt it would detract from the exploratory emphasis of the game and turn it into more of a creative tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://indiegames.com/2012/10/video_how_abstraction_gave_pro.html |title= Video: How Abstraction Gave Proteus its Voice |date= 13 October 2012 |accessdate= 6 August 2013 |work= IndieGames.com |publisher= [[UBM plc]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Autumn in Proteus.png|thumb|left|The island's visuals change with the seasons, such as orange/brown leaves during autumn]]
''Proteus'' was released on 30 January 2013 for Windows and OS X, and on 8 April of the same year for Linux.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linux" /&gt; When  pre-orders were open in 2012, an Artifact Edition was also available; a version which included a boxed version of the game with artwork, the soundtrack, and notes on the game's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shacknews.com/article/72614/proteus-pre-orders-pack-playable-beta |title= Proteus pre-orders pack playable beta |date= 27 February 2012 |accessdate= 24 December 2013 |work= [[Shacknews]] |first= Alice |last= O'Connor |publisher= [[GameFly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key apologised when the Artifact Edition hadn't yet shipped at the end of its release year, and offered to refund customers upon request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shacknews.com/article/82293/proteus-12-patch-on-pcmaclinux-adds-ps3vita-wild-islands |title= Proteus PC patch adds PlayStation's Wild Islands |date= 10 December 2013 |accessdate= 24 December 2013 |first= Ozzie |last= Mejia |work= Shacknews |publisher= GameFly}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Artifact Edition was finally released in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/atwistedtree/status/752860619573981185|title=Twisted Tree Games on Twitter|last=|first=|date=12 July 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time of the game's release, [[Curve Studios]] approached, and later worked with, the developers to [[Porting#Porting in gaming|port]] the game for release on [[PlayStation 3]] and Vita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/01/proteus-games-playstation-3-vita |title= Proteus: adventure game is a meditation on place and nature |date= 1 November 2013 |accessdate= 8 November 2013 |first= Keith |last= Stuart |work= [[The Guardian]] |publisher= Guardian News and Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.edge-online.com/news/curve-studios-is-bringing-proteus-to-ps3-and-vita/ |title= Curve Studios is bringing Proteus to PS3 and Vita |date= 1 July 2013 |accessdate= 8 November 2013 |work= [[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher= Future plc |first= Neil |last= Long}}&lt;/ref&gt; These versions of the game use Curve Studio's own [[game engine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shacknews.com/article/81544/proteus-creator-explains-ps3-vita-exclusive-features |title= Proteus creator explains PS3/Vita-exclusive features |date= 11 October 2013 |accessdate= 8 November 2013 |work= Shack News |first= Ozzie |last= Mejia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony requested that new features be added to the game, though Key said that the company never attempted to steer the direction of the development of these features. Key added location and date-based world generation and a way to interact with the game using the Vita's rear touchpad. He has stated that the location- and date-specific world generation feature could come to the other versions in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/gaming/news/a530326/proteus-how-the-exploration-game-came-to-playstation-platform.html |title= 'Proteus': How the exploration game came to PlayStation platform |date= 13 November 2013 |accessdate= 3 December 2013 |first=Matthew |last= Reynolds |work= [[Digital Spy]] |publisher= [[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita versions were released on 29 October 2013.&lt;ref name="PlayStation release" /&gt;

In an article that discussed 2011's [[exploration game]]s, [[Jim Rossignol]] of [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] described ''Proteus'' as "one of the most charming experiences" he had had in an indie game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/11/24/is-2011-the-year-of-game-world-exploration/ |title= Is 2011 The Year Of Game World Exploration? |date= 24 November 2011 |accessdate= 5 August 2013 |first= Jim |last= Rossignol |work= Rock, Paper, Shotgun}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Rick Lane of [[IGN]] stated that he found the game "delightfully intoxicating", unique, and intriguing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/04/17/proteus-stimulates-your-wanderlust |title= Proteus Stimulates Your Wanderlust |date= 17 April 2012 |accessdate= 5 August 2013 |first= Rick |last= Lane |work= IGN |publisher= Ziff Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Tom Francis of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' responded positively in his game preview, drawing particular attention to the game's changing soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/03/30/proteus-the-best-song-ive-ever-played/ |title= Proteus: the best song I’ve ever played |date= 30 March 2012 |accessdate= 8 August 2013 |first= Tom |last= Francis |work= PC Gamer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Proteus'' received generally positive reviews following release, holding aggregate scores of 80% and 78% on [[Metacritic]] and [[GameRankings]] respectively for the Windows PC version.&lt;ref name= "GR"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/656779-proteus/index.html |title= Proteus for PC |accessdate= 27 July 2013 |work= [[GameRankings]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MC" /&gt; [[Eurogamer]]'s Oli Welsh, ''PC Gamer''{{'}}s Tom Senior, and [[IGN]] writer Nathan Grayson all gave the game's changing audio praise, commenting on how it accompanied them through the game, with Grayson saying, "It's oddly captivating to just walk around and let [the sounds] wash over your surroundings".&lt;ref name="EuroG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PCGUS" /&gt; A review in ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'', though generally positive about the soundtrack, said that the music "never truly gets going", particularly because of the lack of drums in most seasons.&lt;ref name="Edge" /&gt; A [[Shacknews]] staff poll named ''Proteus'' the seventh best game of 2013; Alice O'Connor, writing for the website, called the game "delightfully devoid of explanation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shacknews.com/article/82701/best-of-2013-7-proteus |title= Best of 2013: #7 - Proteus |date= 17 January 2014 |accessdate= 6 February 2014 |first= Alice |last= O'Connor |work= [[Shacknews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's length and [[replay value]] received mixed reactions. [[GameSpot]]'s John Robertson thought that the game had little replayability, and ''PC Gamer''{{'}}s Senior said that the game felt very similar in subsequent playthroughs. [[GameTrailers]]' Daniel Bloodworth, however, thought that the randomly generated islands provided an opportunity to see things players may have missed the first time and Grayson found himself replaying the game many times.&lt;ref name="GSpot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GT" /&gt;

The PlayStation 3 and Vita versions were also well received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-3/proteus |title= Proteus for Playstation 3 reviews |accessdate= 8 November 2013 |work= Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-vita/proteus |title= Proteus for Playstation Vita reviews |work= Metacritic |accessdate= 8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Rose, writing for [[Pocket Gamer]], gave the game 7/10 in his review.

Some debated ''Proteus''{{'}} status as a [[video game]], citing aspects such as the lack of real goals or objectives. Some called it an [[non-game|anti-game]].&lt;ref name="Gamasutra game"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/185645/ |title= Is Proteus a game -- and if not, who cares? |date= 30 January 2013 |accessdate= 7 August 2013 |first= Mike |last= Rose |work= Gamasutra |publisher= UBM TechWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/185885/Opinion_Its_totally_OK_to_not_like_antigames.php |title= Opinion: It's totally OK to not like 'anti-games' |date= 1 February 2013 |accessdate= 7 August 2013 |first= Mike |last= Rose |work= Gamasutra |publisher= UBM TechWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.edge-online.com/features/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-game/ |title= What does it mean to be a game? |date= 17 May 2013 |accessdate= 7 August 2013 |work= Edge |publisher= Future plc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.vg247.com/2013/02/27/proteus-homesick-for-unfamiliar-places/ |title= Proteus: homesick for unfamiliar places |date= 27 February 2013 |accessdate= 8 August 2013 |work= [[VG247]] |first= Brenna |last= Hillier}}&lt;/ref&gt; This description, however, was controversial. Grayson argued that ''Proteus'' does contain an action (walking) and a goal (proceeding through the seasons).&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; ''Edge''{{'}}s reviewer contended that the day/night cycle, changeable weather, and a player-triggered change of seasons qualified ''Proteus'' as a legitimate game.&lt;ref name="Edge" /&gt; Key responded by pointing out that, while the product does include rudimentary game mechanics, interacting with them is optional and they do not usually provide feedback. However, Key went on to argue that "encouraging a strict definition of 'game' does nothing but foster conservatism and defensiveness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kotaku.com/5981097/proteus-creator-defends-his-game++as-a-game |title= Proteus' Creator Defends His Game—as a Game |date= 2 February 2013 |accessdate= 7 August 2013 |first= Owen |last= Good |work= Kotaku |publisher= Gawker Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[research vessel|RV]] '''''Polarstern''''' (meaning [[pole star]]) is a [[Germany|German]] research [[icebreaker]] of the [[Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research]] (AWI) in [[Bremerhaven]]. ''Polarstern'' was commissioned in 1982 and is mainly used for research in the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctica]]. It is planned that she will be replaced by ''Polarstern II'' around the year 2020,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=
https://www.bmbf.de/de/ausschreibung-nachfolgebau-polarstern-2453.html|title=Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung |access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; after it was decided that the [[Aurora Borealis (icebreaker)|European Research Icebreaker ''Aurora Borealis'']] will not be built in her original form.

''Polarstern'' was built by [[Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft]] in [[Kiel]] and  [[Nobiskrug]] in [[Rendsburg]]. The ship has a length of 118 metres (387 feet) and is a [[double hull|double-hulled]] icebreaker. She is operational at temperatures as low as -50°C. (-58°F) ''Polarstern'' can break through ice {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=on}} thick at a speed of 5 [[knot (unit)|knots]]. Thicker ice up to {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} thick can be broken by ramming.

==History==
On 7 September 1991, ''Polarstern'', assisted by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] arctic [[icebreaker]] ''[[Oden (1988 icebreaker)|Oden]]'' reached the [[North Pole]] as the first conventional powered vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Fütterer, D. et al. (1992) The Expedition ARK-VIII/3 of RV Polarstern in 1991, Reports on Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, '''107''', 267 pp, [https://dx.doi.org/10013/epic.10107.d001 hdl:10013/epic.10107.d001] (pdf 6.4 MB)&lt;/ref&gt; Both scientific parties and crew took oceanographic and geological samples and had a common [[tug of war]] and a [[association football|football]] game on an ice floe. ''Polarstern'' again reached the pole exactly 10 years later&lt;ref&gt;Thiede, J. et al. (2002) POLARSTERN ARKTIS XVII/2 Cruise Report: AMORE 2001 (Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge Expedition), Reports on Polar and Marine Research, Bremerhaven, '''421''', 390 pp, [https://dx.doi.org/10013/epic.10107.d001 hdl:10013/epic.10426.d001] (pdf 8 MB)&lt;/ref&gt; together with the [[USCGC Healy|USCGC ''Healy'']]. She returned for a third time on 22 August 22 2011 at exactly 9.42 a.m. This time she reported the most frequently recurring ice thickness at 0.9 m compared with 2 m in 2001, which corresponds to the long-term average.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 2, 2008, one of the vessel's helicopters crashed on a routine flight to the Antarctic [[Neumayer Station|Neumayer II]] base. The German pilot and a Dutch researcher were killed, three other passengers were injured.&lt;ref&gt;

On October 17, 2008, ''Polarstern'' was the first [[research ship]] to ever travel through both the [[Northeast Passage]] and the [[Northwest Passage]] in one cruise, thus circumnavigating the North Pole.&lt;ref&gt;

==Expeditions==
Current listings of all cruises on board ''Polarstern'' as well as associated content (e.g., tracklines, weekly reports, cruise reports, publications and data) are presented in [http://expedition.awi.de AWI's research platform portal].

==In popular culture==
Polarstern is also the name of the first track of [[Eisbrecher|Eisbrecher's]] ([[German language|German]] for ''Icebreaker'') first album, ''[[Eisbrecher (Eisbrecher album)|Eisbrecher]]''.  Throughout the track in Russian, French and only then in German, narrations are given  specifying the dimensions and specifications of an enormous ship, blowing the measurements of the real icebreaker out of proportion (e.g.: length of 236 metres). This way the artist may probably want to reference the international matter of Arctic, the untouchable dominance of Soviet technology pioneers in nuclear-powered icebreakers, and to give the tribute to Russian Arctic researches:  Fabian Gottlieb Thaddeus von Bellingshausen, Ferdinand Friedrich Georg Ludwig von Wrangelll, Georgy Alexeyevich Ushakov, Otto Yulyevich Schmidt and Ivan Dmitrievich Papanin.

The ship plays a central role in German musician [[Schiller (band)|Schiller's]] 2010 album ''[[Atemlos (Schiller album)|Atemlos]]''. A track is titled after the ship. It is also featured in the DVD of the same title, showing the musician's expedition on the vessel.

'''Richard Kiepert''' (September 13, 1846 – August 4, 1915) was a German [[cartographer]] born in [[Weimar]]. He was the son of famed [[geographer]] [[Heinrich Kiepert]].

==Biography==
Richard Kiepert studied [[geography]] and [[history]] in [[Berlin]] and [[Heidelberg]]. In 1870, he traveled in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and [[Asia Minor]], returning to take part in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. In 1874, he received his [[doctorate of philosophy]] at the [[University of Jena]].

Kiepert prepared maps from data amassed by German explorers of Africa that included [[Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs]] (1831–1896) and [[Heinrich Barth]] (1821–1865). Two important African geographic works of his were ''Deutscher Kolonialatlas'' and ''Spezialkarte von Deutsch-Ostafrika''.

From 1874 until 1878 he worked on the compilation of [[Ferdinand von Richthofen]]'s atlas of China, and from 1875 to 1887, he was editor of the geographical periodical ''Globus''. From 1902 until 1908 he worked on the ''Spezialkarte von Kleinasien'', a map of [[Asia Minor]] that was created on a 1:400,000 scale. After his father's death in 1899, he continued the work on the elder Kiepert's classic ''Formae Orbis Antiqui''.

In 1908 Kiepert was the recipient of the [[Carl Ritter]] Medal of the Geographical Society of Berlin, and in 1913 was given the honorary title of professor.

'''Rigenis Street''' ({{lang-el|οδός Ρηγαίνης|}}· ''Rigainis Street'') is a shopping street in central [[Nicosia]] that runs from [[Ledra Street]] to [[Solomos Square]]. It was the busiest street in Nicosia during the British Colonial period in Cyprus after [[Hermes Street]] and [[Ledra Street]].  Rigenis Street is 0.3&amp;nbsp;km long. One publication stated that "mention of 'Rigenis Street' does not call into mind the glorious queen who used to rule Cyprus but rather the cabaret joints for which it is notorious".&lt;ref name="ElDahabWaldvogel2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=ElDahab|first1=Mai Abu|last2=Waldvogel|first2=Florian|last3=Elliman|first3=Paul|title=Nicosia this week, an unofficial guide to the biennial that never was|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTtCAQAAIAAJ|date=March 2008|publisher=Veenman Publishers|isbn=978-90-8690-052-7|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''riverfront''' is a region along a river; often in larger cities that border a river, the riverfront will be lined with [[marina]]s, [[Dock (maritime)|dock]]s, [[park]]s, [[tree]]s, or minor attractions. Today many riverfronts are a staple of [[modernism]] and city [[beautification]].

The '''Serre Calabresi''' or ''Calabrian Serre'' ([[Calabrian languages|Calabrian]] dialect: ''Serra'') are a mountain and hill area of [[Calabria]], southern [[Italy]], characterized by large extents of woods.

The name could be derived by the Jewish ''Ser'', meaning "mountains", or it could refer to the shape of a handsaw. The highest peak is the [[Monte Pecoraro]], with an altitude of 1423&amp;nbsp;m.

==Geography and geology==

The chain begins at the [[Passo della Limina]] and ends at [[Catanzaro Isthm]], the narrowest in Italy (35&amp;nbsp;km separating the [[Ionian Sea]] from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]]). It is bounded by the [[Sila Range]] from the north and by the [[Aspromonte]] from the south.

Geologically, the Serre Calabresi are part of the so-called [[Calabrian Alps]], and are mostly formed by [[graniti]], [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] and [[diorite]]. The eastern area also includes [[sandstone]], while the [[Monte Mammicomito]] has instead a [[limestone]]-[[dolomite]] structure, characterized also by [[Karst topography]]. [[Badlands]] are also present.

==Fauna and vegetation==
The fauna of the Serre has been depleted by human hunting. Recently, the [[Italian wolf]] has returned, probably from Sila.

Vegetation include ''[[Abies alba]]'' and [[Oak]] in the lowest slopes, while the [[Beech]] predominates over the 80&amp;nbsp;m of altitude.

A '''slope-former''' is a unit of [[bedrock]] which is less resistant to [[erosion]] than overlying or underlying units and consequently results in [[outcrop]]s with low relative slope angles.  It may be contrasted with [[cliff-former]].  Typical slope forming lithologies include [[shale]]s, and [[limestone]]s in humid environments.
