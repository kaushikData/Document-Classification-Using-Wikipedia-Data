'''''A Collation of Four Important Manuscripts of the Gospels''''', full title: ''A Collation of Four Important Manuscripts of the Gospels: With a View to Prove Their Common Origin, and to Restore the Text of Their Archetype''. The book was published in 1877 by Thomas Kingsmill Abbott on behalf of his deceased colleague William Hugh Ferrar.

[[William Hugh Ferrar]] (1826–1871) before his death collated four [[Minuscule Greek|minuscules]] (Greek handwritten [[Lower case|cursive]] texts) to demonstrate that they shared a common provenance. The four collated minuscules are: [[Minuscule 13|13]], [[Minuscule 69|69]], [[Minuscule 124|124]], [[Minuscule 346|346]] (known as [[Family 13]] or ''Ferrar Family''). Ferrar intended to establish that these four codices are derived from a common archetype, and to exhibit as nearly as possible the actual text of this [[archetype]] of these four minuscules, a text, therefore, more ancient and authoritative than of any of these manuscripts separately.

The book was published in 1877 by [[Thomas Kingsmill Abbott|T. K. Abbott]] on behalf of William Hugh Ferrar, who had died six years previous.

'''Aish HaTorah''' ({{lang-he-n|אש התורה}}, ''Esh HaTorah'', "Fire of the Torah") is a [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish Orthodox]] organization and [[yeshiva]].

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}

==History==

Aish HaTorah was established in Jerusalem by Rabbi [[Noah Weinberg]] in 1974, after he left the [[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Somayach yeshiva]], which he had previously co-founded. The organization worked to engage young Jews in discussion and study about the relevance of their heritage. It later expanded worldwide, and continues promotes its extensive adult education classes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forward.com/opinion/348004/is-new-israeli-initiative-trying-to-turn-american-jews-into-orthodox-right/|title=Is Israel Trying To Turn American Jews Into Orthodox Right-Wingers?|last=Goldberg|first=J.J.|date=2016-08-16|website=The Forward|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Aish HaTorah describes itself as blending the traditions of the [[Litvishe|Lithuanian]] [[yeshiva]]s with the doctrines of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} Weinberg himself was a product of Lithuanian schools but he was also a grandson of the [[Slonim (Hasidic dynasty)|Slonimer]] [[Rebbe#Hasidic Rebbe|Rebbe]]. His teachings reflect influences of both schools as well as certain facets of the [[Kabbalah]] of Rabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], the [[Vilna Gaon]] and others.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Aish HaTorah describes itself as pro-Israel and encourages Jewish people to visit Israel and connect to the land and its history. The organization's stated mission is "providing opportunities for Jews of all backgrounds to discover their heritage."

===Name===

The name Aish HaTorah, literally "Fire [of] the Torah", was inspired by the [[Talmud]]ic story of [[Rabbi Akiva]], the once illiterate 40-year-old shepherd who subsequently became the most famous sage of the [[Mishnah]]. [[Elie Wiesel]] said, "Aish HaTorah means to me the passion of teaching, the passion of learning. The study of Torah, the source of Jewish values, is the way to Jewish survival."

==Programs==

Aish HaTorah operates about 35 full-time branches on five continents, providing seminars, singles events, executive learning groups, [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday]] programs, and community building.

In Jerusalem, the Aish HaTorah yeshiva offers both beginners' drop-in classes and full-time, intensive study programs for Jewish men and women of all backgrounds and levels of knowledge. It has a high-tech main campus and outreach center that features a rooftop vista overlooking the [[Temple Mount]], and the [[Kirk Douglas]] Theatre, which houses a dramatic film presentation of the Jewish contribution to humanity. An "Explorium" of Jewish History is scheduled to open in 2013, designed to accommodate 300,000 visitors annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simmons|first=Shraga|title=Premier Educational Programs Amidst an Architectural Marvel|url=http://www.aish.com/ci/s/78061807.html|work=News article|publisher=Aish.com|accessdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aish HaTorah runs the Discovery Seminar. The four-hour seminar reviews [[Jewish history]], [[Jewish philosophy]], and Jewish philosophy questions.

===Films===
In 2005 Aish HaTorah produced a documentary film, ''Inspired'' which chronicles the lives of selected [[baal teshuva|baalei teshuvah]] ("returnees to Jewish observance"). Aish HaTorah believes that the high rate of [[Interreligious marriage#Judaism|intermarriage]] between Jews and non-Jews has diluted the Jewish people’s vitality. ''Inspired'' was produced to encourage more [[Orthodox Judaism|observant Jews]] to share their positive Jewish religious experiences of Jewish life with non-observant Jews, as a way to strengthen the baal teshuva movement and revitalize Jewish life.

In 2007 Aish released a sequel, ''Inspired Too''. These films paved the way for Project Inspire, the grassroots organization that helps inspire Orthodox Jews to reach out to non-affiliated Jews to teach them about their heritage. Once an offshoot of Aish HaTorah, Project Inspire is now an independent organization under the umbrella of Aish Global.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inspire Yourself to Inspire Others|url=http://www.projectinspire.com/about.php|website=Project Inspire|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[Clarion Project]], an organization that shares staff, fundraising sources and an address with Aish HaTorah, and has been linked in media reports with Aish HaTorah,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/nyregion/in-police-training-a-dark-film-on-us-muslims.html|title=In Police Training, a Dark Film on U.S. Muslims|last=Powell|first=Michael|date=2012-01-23|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/senders-of-islam-movie-obsession-tied-to-jewish-charity/827910|title=Senders of Islam movie 'Obsession' tied to Jewish charity|last=Laughlin|first=Meg|date=2008-09-26|website=Tampa Bay Times|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910042700/http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/senders-of-islam-movie-obsession-tied-to-jewish-charity/827910|archive-date=2016-09-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; distributed its film called "Obsession." The film had been criticized for being unfair in its portrayal of Muslims as violent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The film was sent to more than 28 million people in the [[United States]] in anticipation of the [[United States presidential election, 2008|United States presidential election]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2008/10/the-jewish-extremists-behind-quot-obsession-quot/9006/|title=The Jewish Extremists Behind "Obsession"|last=Goldberg|first=Jeffrey|date=|website=The Atlantic|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Aish HaTorah denied any connection to the film.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[Council on American–Islamic Relations]] filed a complaint about the film with the [[Federal Election Commission]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 2012, the [[Clarion Project]] released a film called [[The Third Jihad: Radical Islam's Vision For America|The Third Jihad]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The film was produced by Raphael Shore, who works for Aish HaTorah.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forward.com/opinion/150677/islamophobic-film-and-its-jewish-backers/|title=Islamophobic Film and Its Jewish Backers|last=Goldberg|first=J.J.|date=|website=[[The Forward]]|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was called "Islamophobic" by [[The Forward]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Hasbara Fellowships===
{{Main article|Hasbara Fellowships}}
When the Israeli Foreign Ministry sought to combat anti-Israel ideas on college campuses, it worked with Aish HaTorah to develop the [[Hasbara Fellowships]]. This program has flown hundreds of student leaders to Israel for intensive training in pro-Israel activism training. In North America, Hasbara Fellowships guides and funds pro-Israel activities on over 100 college campuses.

===The Israel-Diaspora Initiative===
In August 2016, the Israeli government announced an Israel-[[Diaspora]] outreach program called The Israel-Diaspora Initiative. The program partners were announced as [[Chabad]] and Olami Worldwide, an organization that works closely with Aish.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.737097|title=Orthodox Groups to Lead Israel's New Bid to 'Strengthen Jewish Identity' of Diaspora Youth – Israel News – Haaretz|website=www.haaretz.com|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1517">The '''Australian Association for Humane Research Inc.''' (AAHR) is an [[Australia]]n-based non-profit anti-[[vivisection]] organisation.

==History==
Humane Research Australia (previously named AAHR) was founded in 1979 by Ms Elizabeth Ahlston.

It moved to Melbourne in early 2005 under the stewardship of newly appointed CEO Helen Marston.

Humane Research Australia works professionally and ethically to develop community-wide awareness of animal experimentation; pursues all reasonable channels to eliminate such experimentation and champions the benefits of realistic, scientifically effective alternatives to all forms of animal usage in research and teaching.

The Association holds and maintain the following as core principles:
* Extrapolation of research data obtained from animal experimentation to humans is ineffective, inconclusive and often unnecessarily dangerous to humans.  
* There are more scientifically reliable and effective ways to conduct research other than with the use of animals.
* Animal-based research and teaching represents unnecessarily cruel and unethical treatments of other sentient beings with little or no redeeming value for human or other species’ advancement.

'''Cephalization''' is an [[evolution]]ary trend in which, over many generations, the mouth, [[sense organ]]s, and nerve ganglia become concentrated at the front end of an [[animal]], producing a [[head]] region. This is associated with [[animal locomotion|movement]] and [[bilateral symmetry (biology)|bilateral symmetry]], such that the animal has a definite head end. This led to the formation of a [[brain]] in three groups of animals, namely the [[arthropod]]s, [[cephalopod]] [[mollusc]]s, and [[vertebrate]]s. Since the molluscs ([[protostome]]s) and the vertebrates ([[deuterostome]]s) are widely separated on the phylogenetic tree of animals, and have differently organized bodies and brains, cephalization [[convergent evolution|evolved independently]] in these groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trends in evolution|url=https://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_54|publisher=UCMP Berkeley|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Cephalization in Zoology?|url=http://education.seattlepi.com/cephalization-zoology-4354.html|publisher=Hearst Seattle Media|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals without bilateral symmetry==

[[Cnidaria]] such as the radially symmetrical [[Hydrozoa]], show some degree of cephalization. The [[Anthomedusae]] have a head end with their mouth, photoreceptive cells, and a concentration of neural cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Satterlie |first1=Richard |title=Cnidarian Neurobiology |url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190456757.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780190456757-e-7?mediaType=Article |publisher=Oxford |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190456757.013.7 |date=February 2017 |quote=Ocelli located at the base of the many tentacles represent one input to the B system, whereas the neurons of the O system are directly photosensitive. Many hydromedusae have ocelli of different levels of complexity (Singla, 1974). In addition, other marginal sensory structures associated with the outer nerve ring include statocysts (Singla, 1975), and mechanoreceptors, such as the tactile combs of Aglantha, which are located at the tentacle bases, and can activate the escape swimming circuitry (Arkett &amp; Mackie, 1988; Mackie, 2004b).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilateria==
[[File:Bilaterian body plan.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Idealised [[bilateria]]n [[body plan]]. With a cylindrical body and a direction of forward [[animal locomotion|movement]] the animal has head and tail ends, favouring cephalization by [[natural selection]].

{{further|Bilateria}}

Cephalization is a characteristic feature of the [[Bilateria]], a large group containing the majority of animal phyla. These have the ability to move, using muscles, and a [[body plan]] with a front end that encounters stimuli first as the animal moves forwards, and accordingly has evolved to contain many of the body's sense organs, able to detect light, chemicals, and often sound. There is often also a collection of nerve cells able to process the information from these sense organs, forming a brain in several phyla and one or more ganglia in others.&lt;ref name=Brusca2016&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://www.sinauer.com/media/wysiwyg/samples/Brusca3e_Chapter_9.pdf |title=Introduction to the Bilateria and the Phylum Xenacoelomorpha {{!}} Triploblasty and Bilateral Symmetry Provide New Avenues for Animal Radiation |work=Invertebrates |last=Brusca |first=Richard C. |date=2016 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |pages=345–372 |isbn=978-1605353753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acoela===
The [[Acoela]] are basal bilaterians, part of the [[Xenacoelomorpha]]. They are small and simple animals, and have very slightly more nerve cells at the head end than elsewhere, not forming a distinct and compact brain. This represents an early stage in cephalization.&lt;ref name="Cabej2013"&gt;{{cite book | last=Çabej | first=Nelson | title=Rise of the Animal Kingdom and Epigenetic Mechanisms of Evolution|work=Building the most complex structure on Earth : an epigenetic narrative of development and evolution of animals | publisher=Elsevier | year=2013 | isbn=978-0-12-401667-5 | pages=239–298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flatworms===
[[File:Yellow papillae flatworm (Thysanozoon nigropapillosum) (cropped).jpg|thumb|The yellow papillae flatworm, ''[[Thysanozoon nigropapillosum]]'', is somewhat cephalized, with a distinct head end (at right) which has pseudotentacles and an eyespot.]]

The [[Platyhelminthes]] (flatworms) have a more complex nervous system than the Acoela, and are lightly cephalized, for instance having an eyespot above the brain, near the front end.&lt;ref name="Cabej2013"/&gt;

===Complex active bodies===
The philosopher Michael Trestman noted that three bilaterian phyla, namely the arthropods, the molluscs in the shape of the cephalopods, and the chordates, were distinctive in having "complex active bodies", something that the acoels and flatworms did not have. Any such animal, whether predator or prey, has to be aware of its environment—to catch its prey, or to evade its predators. These groups are exactly those that are most highly cephalized.&lt;ref name="Trestman2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Trestman | first=Michael | title=The Cambrian Explosion and the Origins of Embodied Cognition | journal=Biological Theory | volume=8 | issue=1 | date=April 2013 | doi=10.1007/s13752-013-0102-6 | pages=80–92 |url=https://michaeltrestman.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/trestman-cambrian-pub.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Godfrey-Smith |first=Peter |title=Other Minds: The Octopus and the Evolution of Intelligent Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GeEZDQAAQBAJ  |year=2017 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0-00-822628-2 |page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; These groups, however, are not closely related: in fact, they represent widely separated branches of the Bilateria, as shown on the [[phylogenetic tree]]; their lineages split hundreds of  millions of years ago.

====Arthropods====
{{further|Arthropod head problem}}

In [[arthropod]]s, cephalization progressed with increasing incorporation of trunk segments into the head region. This was advantageous because it allowed for the evolution of more effective mouth-parts for capturing and processing food. [[Insect]]s are strongly cephalized, their brain made of three fused [[ganglia]] attached to the ventral nerve cord, which in turn has a pair of ganglia in each segment of the thorax and abdomen. The insect head is an elaborate structure made of several segments fused rigidly together, and equipped with both simple and [[compound eye]]s, and multiple appendages including sensory [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] and complex [[insect mouthparts|mouthparts]] (maxillae and mandibles).&lt;ref name="Cabej2013"/&gt;

[[Cephalopod]] [[mollusc]]s including [[octopus]], [[squid]], [[cuttlefish]] and [[nautilus]] are the most intelligent and highly cephalized invertebrates, with well-developed senses, including [[cephalopod eye|advanced 'camera' eyes]] and large brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tricarico |first1=E. |last2=Amodio |first2=P. |last3=Ponte |first3=G. |last4=Fiorito |first4=G. |year=2014 |chapter=Cognition and recognition in the cephalopod mollusc ''Octopus vulgaris'': coordinating interaction with environment and conspecifics |editor-last=Witzany|editor-first=G. |title=Biocommunication of Animals |publisher=Springer |pages=337–349 |isbn=978-94-007-7413-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Solomon |first1=Eldra|last2=Berg |first2=Linda |last3=Martin |first3=Diana W. |title=Biology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdQ8AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA884 |year=2010 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=1-133-17032-3 |page=884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vertebrates====
{{further|Head}}
[[File:Vertebrate-brain-regions small.png|thumb|upright|[[Brain]]s of [[shark]] and [[human]] illustrate accelerating cephalization, as the parts enlarge and change shape.]]

Cephalization in [[vertebrate]]s, the group that includes [[mammals]], [[birds]], and [[fishes]], has been studied extensively.&lt;ref name="Cabej2013"/&gt; The heads of vertebrates are complex structures, with distinct sense organs; a large, multi-lobed brain; jaws, often with teeth; and a tongue. [[Cephalochordate]]s like ''[[Branchiostoma]]'' (the lancelet, a small fishlike animal with very little cephalization), are closely related to vertebrates but do not have these structures. In the 1980s, the [[new head hypothesis]] proposed that the vertebrate head is an evolutionary novelty resulting from the emergence of [[neural crest]] and cranial [[placode]]s (thickened areas of [[ectoderm]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gans, C. &amp; Northcutt, R. G. Neural crest and the origin of vertebrates: a new head. ''Science'' 220, 268–273 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diogo, R., et al. (2015). A new heart for a new head in vertebrate cardiopharyngeal evolution. ''Nature'', 520(7548), 466.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2014, a transient [[larva]] tissue of the lancelet was found to be virtually indistinguishable from the [[neural crest]]-derived [[cartilage]] which forms the vertebrate [[skull]], suggesting that persistence of this tissue and expansion into the entire head space could be a viable evolutionary route to formation of the vertebrate head.&lt;ref name="jandzik2014"&gt;{{cite journal | doi= 10.1038/nature14000| title= Evolution of the new vertebrate head by co-option of an ancient chordate skeletal tissue| journal= Nature| date= 26 February 2015| last1= Jandzik | first1= D. | last2= Garnett | first2= A.

'''Cercops''' ({{lang-el|Κέρκωψ}}) was one of the oldest [[Orphic]] poets. He was called a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] by [[Clement of Alexandria]], which might have meant a [[Neopythagoreanism|Neopythagorean]].&lt;ref name="dork"&gt;Clement of Alexandria, ''[[Stromata]]'', i.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]] ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' i. 38&lt;/ref&gt; was said by [[Epigenes of Alexandria]] to have been the author of an Orphic epic poem entitled "''the Descent to Hades''" which seems to have been extant in the Alexandrian period.&lt;ref name="dork"/&gt; Others attribute this work to [[Prodicus of Samos]], or [[Herodicus of Perinthus]], or [[Orpheus of Camarina]].&lt;ref&gt;Suda, ''Orpheus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Epigenes also assigns to Cercops&lt;ref name="dork"/&gt; the Orphic ἱερος λογός which was ascribed by some to [[Theognetus of Thessaly]], and was a poem in twenty-four books.

The book ''The works of Aristotle'' (1908, p.&amp;nbsp;80 Fragments) mentioned&lt;ref name=Aristotle1908&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/worksofaristotle12arisuoft|title=The works of Aristotle|year=1908|author=Aristotle|author2=Ross, William David (1877)|author3=Smith, John Alexander (1863-1939)|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Aristotle]] says the poet ''Orpheus'' never existed; the Pythagoreans ascribe this Orphic poem to a certain ''Cercon'' (which likely means ''Cercops'').

==Life==
Born in [[San Francisco]], Charles Upton grew up in [[Marin County, California]].  He attended [[Catholic]] schools through high school. He attended [[University of California Davis|UC Davis]] for  four days.

==Career==
In San Francisco, he met the poet [[Lew Welch]], who became his mentor. Although much younger than most of the Beat poets, Upton's first two volumes of poetry were also published by [[City Lights Bookstore|City Lights]].  It was associated with many of the earlier Beat poets.

After his first two volumes of poems were published, Upton became involved with the [[Sanctuary Movement]] for [[Central American]] [[refugees]]. He produced and distributed a video, ''Through the Needle’s Eye'', containing testimonies of refugees.

In the late 1980s he was briefly involved with the "magical populism" of the [[New Age]] peace movement.  He studied group [[dreamwork]] and dream networking.

In 1988 he joined a traditional [[Sufi]] order.  Under his wife's influence, Upton became interested in the [[metaphysics]] of the [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalist]] or Perennialist School (the followers of [[Rene Guenon]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] and [[Frithjof Schuon]]).  He continues to be partly identified with this school.

His papers are held at [[University of Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://doddcenter.uconn.edu/findaids/Upton/MSS20030017.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090801085905/http://doddcenter.uconn.edu/findaids/Upton/MSS20030017.html |archivedate=August 1, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
Charles Upton conceived of The Covenants Initiative which urges Muslims to abide by the covenants concluded between Muhammad and the Christian communities of his time.&lt;ref&gt;http://weku.fm/post/islamic-scholar-speaks-muslim-covenant&lt;/ref&gt; The Covenants Initiative has now expanded into the Genocide Initiative. This new effort, created upon the request of Bishop Francis Kalabat from the Chaldean Catholic Church, seeks to place pressure on political players to describe the crimes of ISIS and other Takfiri terrorists as acts of cultural, religious, and ethnic genocide.

==Marriage and family==
He married [[Jennifer Doane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.seriousseekers.com/Teachers%20and%20Contributors/teachers_priority_1_traditionalandfriends/teachers_contributors_Upton_c.htm# |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 16, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821133344/http://seriousseekers.com/Teachers%20and%20Contributors/teachers_priority_1_traditionalandfriends/teachers_contributors_Upton_c.htm# |archive-date=August 21, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After living in [[Marin County, California]], they currently live in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sophiaperennis.com/shop/perennis/21.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524082201/http://www.sophiaperennis.com/shop/perennis/21.html |archivedate=May 24, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''critical edition''' of an opera has been defined by American [[musicologist]] [[Philip Gossett]] as "an edition that bases itself wherever possible on the very finest and most accurate sources for an opera. That means that it must study the entire performance history of a work."&lt;ref name=GAZZ/&gt;

Gossett continues:
:In some cases of course we have an autograph manuscript, and that helps us, but it is also where many of the problems start, because composers are known to have made mistakes in their autograph manuscripts. And therefore we are required—we feel it is necessary—to intervene and to correct errors that sometimes have been perpetrated on these works by printed editions from the beginning, so they are just mistakes in the old editions, simple mistakes.&lt;ref name=GAZZ&gt;Luiz Gazzola, [http://operalively.com/forums/content.php/535-Exclusive-Opera-Lively-Interview-with-Italian-Opera-scholar-Dr-Philip-Gossett "Exclusive ''Opera Lively'' Interview with Italian Opera scholar Dr. Philip Gossett"] on operalively.com. 17 June 2012. Retrieved 26 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of critical editions of many works from the 19th-century Italian operatic repertory did not begin until the 1950s and resulted from the revival of interest from that time forward in the ''[[bel canto]]'' era—early 1800s to approximately 1850 and known as the ''primo ottocento''—written by [[Gioachino Rossini]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], and [[Giuseppe Verdi]], in addition to many other relatively minor composers who composed many works.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Roger (1998), "The 19th and 20th centuries", in Sadie, Vol. Two, pp. 14—16&lt;/ref&gt; But, as musicologist Ellen Rosand also notes, "the editing of operatic works from the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;Rosand 1998, pp. 11—13&lt;/ref&gt; the 18th century&lt;ref&gt;Rosand 1998, pp 13—14&lt;/ref&gt; and 19th century provides many considerable challenges.

In an online essay – "What is a critical edition?: Answers to Questions You Never Thought to Ask" – which focuses primarily on Rossini, musicologist Patricia Brauner of the Center for Italian Opera Studies at the University of Chicago explains several different aspects of a critical edition, including the process of producing published editions and the ultimate value of them for performers and conductors.&lt;ref&gt;Brauner, [http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Essays%20from%20CIAO/Rcritical%20edition.html "What is a critical edition?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Musicologist]]s such as Gossett and [[Roger Parker]] represent parallel approaches to the works of the Italian ''bel canto'' era. The former is now General Editor of ''The Critical Edition of the Works of Giuseppe Verdi''&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Vavail.html Critical editions of Verdi's operas published by the University of Chicago] on humanities.uchicago.edu&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Chicago's Center for Italian Opera Studies – in addition to being an acknowledged expert in preparing critical editions of the operas of Rossini – while the other is Professor of Music at [[King's College London]] and editor of many of the operas of Donizetti,&lt;ref&gt;Parker, "The Critical Editions of Gaetano Donizetti's Operas" on ricordi.it&lt;/ref&gt; as well as having written extensively on Verdi. He is the founding co-editor (with Arthur Groos) of the ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', and he continues as General Editor (with Gabriele Dotto, who headed the editorial division of Ricordi until 2001) of ''The Critical Edition of the Operas of Gaetano Donizetti'' published by [[Casa Ricordi]] of Milan.

Gossett clarifies how the existence of these editions may affect performances:
:We don’t believe that everybody has to perform just what we do, because that’s not what they did in the nineteenth century, not what composers did or expected, but we do think that performers should base their work on the finest editions possible, and that’s what we try to produce.&lt;ref name=GAZZ/&gt;

The pioneering work of the major Italian music publishing house, [[Casa Ricordi]], reveals how extensive the company's involvement in restoring the work of 19th-century composers Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, and Verdi has been.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halleonard.com/bin/CatClassicalCriticaleds.pdf Universal Music Publishing Classical Critical Editions] website&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, the German publishing house [[Bärenreiter|Bärenreiter-Verlag]] has been producing editions of Rossini's operas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hum.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Barenreiter%20plan.htm "Works of Giacchino Rossini"] on hum.uchicago.edu&lt;/ref&gt; having become the successor to the Fondazione Rossini Pesaro, which produced many editions between 1979 and 2005. Today, many are still published by Ricordi in Europe and in the US by the University of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hum.uchicago.edu/orgs/ciao/Introductory/Ravail.html List of critical editions produced under the Fondazione Rossini, 1979 to 2005] on hum.uchicago.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dmitry Sergeyevich Merezhkovsky''' ({{lang-rus|Дми́трий Серге́евич Мережко́вский|p=ˈdʲmʲitrʲɪj sʲɪrˈɡʲejɪvʲɪtɕ mʲɪrʲɪˈʂkofskʲɪj}}; {{OldStyleDate|14 August|1866|2 August}} – December 9, 1941) was a [[Russians|Russian]] novelist, poet, religious thinker, and literary critic. A seminal figure of the [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry]], regarded as a co-founder of the [[Russian Symbolism|Symbolist movement]], Merezhkovsky – with his poet wife [[Zinaida Gippius]] – was twice forced into political exile. During his second exile (1918–1941) he continued publishing successful novels and gained recognition as a critic of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Union]]. Known both as a self-styled religious prophet with his own slant on apocalyptic Christianity, and as the author of philosophical historical novels which combined fervent idealism with literary innovation, Merezhkovsky was nine times a nominee for the [[Nobel Prize in literature]], which he came closest to winning in 1933.&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;{{cite web| date =| url=http://www.answers.com/topic/merezhkovsky-dmitri-sergeyevich| title=  Dmitry Sergeyevich Merezhkovsky| publisher = Columbia Encyclopedia| accessdate = October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dic_lit_bio"&gt;{{cite web

==Biography==
Dmitry Sergeyevich Merezhkovsky was born on August 2, 1866, in [[Saint Petersburg]], the sixth son in the family. His father Sergey Ivanovich Merezhkovsky served as a senior official in several Russian local governors' cabinets (including that of I.D.Talyzin in [[Orenburg]]) before entering [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]]'s court office as a [[Privy Councillor]].&lt;ref name="mih"&gt;''Mihaylov, Oleg''. "The Prisoner of Culture". The Foreword to The Complete Work of D.S.Merezhkovsky in 4 volumes. 1990. Pravda Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother Varvara Vasilyevna Merezhkovskaya (née Tcherkasova) was a daughter of a senior Saint Petersburg security official. Fond of arts and literature, she was what Dmitry Merezhkovsky later remembered as the guiding light of his rather lonely childhood (despite the presence of five brothers and three sisters around). There were only three people Merezhkovsky had any affinity with in his whole lifetime, and his mother, a woman "of rare beauty and angelic nature" according to biographer Yuri Zobnin, was the first and the most important of them.&lt;ref name="zobnin"&gt;''Zobnin, Yuri''. The Life and Deeds of Dmitry Merezhkovsky. 2008 // Moscow. — Molodaya Gvardiya Publishers. Lives of Distinguished People series, issue 1091. {{ISBN|978-5-235-03072-5}} pp.15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early years===
Dmitry Merezhkovsky spent his early years on the Yelagin Island in Saint Petersburg, in a palace-like cottage which served as a summer [[dacha]] for the family.&lt;ref name="chur_1"&gt;{{cite web | author = Tchurakov, A.D. | date = | url = http://www.portal-slovo.ru/history/35131.php | title = Russian decadent movement aesthetics in the late 19th – early 20th century. Early Merezhkovsky. p. 1 |publisher  = www.portal-slovo.ru | accessdate = February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the city the family occupied an old house facing the Summer Gardens, near Prachechny Bridge. The Merezhkovskys also owned a large estate in [[Crimea]], by a road leading to the [[Uchan-su (waterfall)|Uchan-Su waterfall]]. "Fabulous Oreanda palace, now in ruins, will stay with me forever. White marble pylons against the blue sea... for me it's a timeless symbol of [[Ancient Greece]]," he wrote years later.&lt;ref name="nico"&gt;{{cite web | author = Nikolyukin, А. | date =  | url = http://russianway.rchgi.spb.ru/Merezhkovsky/nikolyuk.html | title = Merezhkovsky's Phenomenon | publisher = russianway.rchgi.spb.ru | accessdate = January 2, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041113173125/http://russianway.rchgi.spb.ru/Merezhkovsky/nikolyuk.html | archivedate = November 13, 2004 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sergey Merezhkovsky, although a man of means, led an [[ascetic]] life, keeping his household 'lean and thrifty'. He saw this also as 'moral prophylactics' for his children, regarding luxury-seeking and reckless spending as the two deadliest sins. The parents traveled a lot, and an old German housekeeper Amalia Khristianovna spent much time with the children, amusing them with Russian fairytales and Biblical stories. It was her recounting of saints' lives that helped Dmitry to develop fervent religious feelings in his early teens.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1876 Dmitry Merezhkovsky joined an elite grammar school, the St. Petersburg Third Classic Gymnasium.&lt;ref name="krugosvet"&gt;{{cite web | author = Polonsky, Vadim | date = | url = http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/kultura_i_obrazovanie/literatura/MEREZHKOVSKI_DMITRI_SERGEEVICH.html | title = Merezhkovsky, Dmitry Sergeevich | publisher = www.krugosvet.ru | accessdate = February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years spent there he described later by one word, "murderous", remembering just one teacher as a decent person – "Kessler the Latinist; well-meaning he surely never was, but at least had a kindly look."&lt;ref name="magomedo"&gt;{{cite web  | author = Magomedova, D.M. | year = 1993 | url  =   http://az.lib.ru/m/merezhkowskij_d_s/text_0050.shtml | title = Foreword.

He became fascinated with the works of [[Molière]] to such an extent as to form a Molière Circle in the Gymnasium. The group had nothing political on its agenda, but still made the secret police interested. All of its members were summoned one by one to the [[Third Section of His Imperial Majesty's Own Chancellery|Third Department]]'s headquarters by the Politzeisky Bridge to be questioned. It is believed that only Sergey Merezhkovsky's efforts prevented his son from being expelled from the school.&lt;ref name="nico"/&gt;

====Debut====
Much as Dmitry disliked his tight upper-lipped, stone-faced father, later he had to give him credit for being the first one to have noticed and, in his emotionless way, appreciate his first poetic exercises. In July 1879, in [[Alupka]], Crimea, Sergey Ivanovich introduced Dmitry to the legendary Princess Yekaterina  Vorontzova, once Pushkin's sweetheart. The grand dame admired the boy's verses: she (according to a biographer) "spotted in them a must-have poetic quality: the metaphysical sensitivity of a young soul" and encouraged him to soldier on.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat different was young Merezhkovsky's encounter with another luminary, [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], staged by his well-connected father again. As the boy started reciting his work, nervous to the point of stuttering, the famous novelist listened rather impatiently, then said: "Poor, very poor. To write well, one has to suffer. Suffer!" – "Oh no, I'd rather he won't – either suffer, or write well!", the appalled father exclaimed. The boy left Dostoyevsky's house much frustrated by the great man's verdict.&lt;ref name="krugosvet"/&gt; Merezhkovsky's debut publication followed the same year: Saint Petersburg magazine ''[[Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye]]'' published two of his poems, "Little Cloud" and "The Autumn Melody". A year later another poem "Narcissus" was included in a charity compilation benefiting destitute students, edited by [[Pyotr Yakubovich]].&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

In Autumn 1882 Merezhkovsky attended one of the first of [[Semyon Nadson]]'s public readings and, deeply impressed, wrote him a letter. Soon Nadson became Merezhkovsky's closest friend – in fact, the only one, apart from his mother. Later researchers suggested there was some mystery shared by the two young men, something to do with "fatal illness, fear of death and longing for faith as an antidote to such fear." Nadson died in 1887, Varvara Vasilyevna two years later; feeling that he's lost everything he'd ever had in this world, Merezhkovsky submerged into deep depression.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.81-82&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1883 ''[[Otechestvennye Zapiski]]'' published two more of Merezhkovsky's poems. "Sakya Muni", the best known of his earlier works, entered popular poetry recital compilations of the time and made the author almost famous. By 1896 Merezhkovsky was rated as "a well known poet" by the ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]''. Years later, having gained fame as a novelist, he felt embarrassed by his poetry and, while compiling his first ''Complete'' series in the late 1900s, cut the poetry section down to several pieces.&lt;ref name="mih"/&gt; Nevertheless, Merezhkovsky's poems remained popular, and some major Russian composers, [[Rachmaninoff]] and [[Tchaikovsky]] among them, have set dozens of them to music.&lt;ref name="semigin"&gt;{{cite web | author = Semigin, V.D.| date = | url = http://www.lib.ua-ru.net/diss/cont/65835.html | title = D.S.Merezhkovsky in Russia's cultural and social life of the late XIX century (1880–1893) | publisher = www.lib.ua-ru.net | accessdate = February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====University years====
In 1884–1889 Merezhkovsky studied history and [[philology]] at the [[University of Saint Petersburg]] where his PhD was on [[Montaigne]]. He learned several foreign languages and developed strong interest in the [[French literature]], the philosophy of [[positivism]], theories of [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Charles Darwin]]. Still, his student years were joyless. "University gave me no more than a Gymnasium did. I've never had proper – either family, or education," he wrote in his 1913 autobiography.&lt;ref name="chur_1"/&gt; The only lecturer he remembered fondly was the historian of literature [[Orest Miller]], who held a domestic literature circle.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884 Merezhkovsky (along with Nadson) joined the Saint Petersburg's Literary Society, on [[Aleksey Pleshcheyev]]'s recommendation. The latter introduced the young poet to the family of [[Karl Davydov]], head of the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]]. His wife Anna Arkadyevna became Merezhkovsky's publisher in the 1890s, their daughter Julia – his first (strong, even if fleeting) romantic interest. In Davydov's circle Merezhkovsky mixed with well-established literary figures of the time – [[Ivan Goncharov]], [[Apollon Maykov]], [[Yakov Polonsky]], but also [[Nikolay Mikhaylovsky]] and [[Gleb Uspensky]], two prominent [[narodnik]]s whom he regarded later as his first real teachers.&lt;ref name="writerstob"&gt;{{cite web | date =| url = http://writerstob.narod.ru/writers/meregskovski.htm | title = Dmitry Sergeevich Merezhkovsky | publisher = writerstob.narod.ru | accessdate = February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was under the guidance of the latter that Merezhkovsky, while still a University student, embarked upon an extensive journey through the Russian provinces where he met lots of people, notably religious cults leaders. He stayed for some time in [[Chudovo, Chudovsky District, Novgorod Oblast|Chudovo]] village where Uspensky lived, and both men spent many sleepless nights discussing things like "life's religious meaning," "a common man's cosmic vision" and "the power of the land." At the time he was seriously considering leaving the capital to settle down in some far-out country place and become a teacher.&lt;ref name="nico"/&gt;

Another big influence was Mikhaylovsky, who introduced the young man to the staff of ''[[Severny Vestnik]]'', a literary magazine he founded with Davydova. Here Merezhkovsky met [[Vladimir Korolenko]] and [[Vsevolod Garshin]], and later [[Nikolai Minsky]], [[Konstantin Balmont]] and [[Fyodor Sologub]]: the future leaders of the Russian Symbolism movement.&lt;ref name="writerstob"/&gt; Merezhkovsky's first article for the magazine, "A Peasant in the French literature", upset his mentor: Mikhaylovsky spotted in his young  protégé the "penchant for mysticism," something he himself was averse to.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1888 Merezhkovsky graduated from the University and  embarked upon a tour through the South of Russia, starting in [[Odessa]]. In [[Borjomi]] he met 19-year-old poet [[Zinaida Gippius]]. The two fell in love and on January 18, 1889, married in [[Tiflis]], making arguably the most prolific and influential couple in the history of Russian literature.&lt;ref name="writerstob"/&gt;&lt;ref name="merezh_ru"&gt;{{cite web | date = |url = http://www.merezhkovski.ru/biografy.php | title = The Biography of Dmitry Sergeevich Merezhkovsky | publisher = ww.merezhkovski.ru | accessdate = January 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon husband and wife moved into their new Saint Petersburg house, Merezkovsky's mother's wedding present.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web| author = Shelokhonov, Steve| date = | url = https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2267001/bio | title = Zinaida Gippius biography| publisher  = www.imdb.com | accessdate = October 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 1880s to early 1890s===
Merezhkovsky's major literary debut came with the publication of ''Poems (1883–1888)''. It brought the author into the focus of the most favourable critical attention, but – even coupled with ''Protopop Avvacum'', a poetry epic released the same year, could not solve young family's financial problems. Helpfully, Gippius unexpectedly reinvented herself as a prolific fiction writer, starting to churn out novels and novelettes she couldn't later even remember the titles of. Sergey Merezhkovsky's occasional hand-outs also helped the husband and wife to keep their meagre budget afloat.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Having by this time lost interest in poetry, Dmitry Merezhkovsky developed a strong affinity to [[Greek drama]] and published translations of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] in ''Vestnik Evropy''.&lt;ref name="rulex"&gt;{{cite web | date = | url = http://www.rulex.ru/01130429.htm | title = Merezkovsky Dmitry Sergeevich | publisher = Russian Biographies Dictionary | accessdate = February 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These and some of his later translations from Ancient Greek (like prosaic version of ''Daphnis and Chloe'', 1896), almost unnoticed by the contemporary critics, later came to be regarded (according to biographer Yuri Zobnin) "the pride of the Russian school of classical translation."&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1880s Merezhkovsky debuted as a literary critic with an essay on [[Anton Chekhov]] entitled "A Newly-born Talent Facing the Same Old Question" and published by ''Severny Vestnik''. Having spotted in his subject's prose "the seeds of irrational, alternative truth," Merezhkovsky inadvertently put an end to his friendship with Mikhaylovsky and amused Chekhov who, in his letter to Pleshcheev, mentioned the "disturbing lack of simplicity" as the article's major fault.&lt;ref name="Zobnin, p. 402"&gt;Zobnin, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; Merezhkovsky continued in the same vein and thus invented (in retrospect) the whole new genre of a philosophical essay as a form of critical thesis, something unheard of in Russian literature before. Merezhkovsky's biographical pieces on Pushkin, Dostoyevsky, Goncharov, Maykov, Korolenko, [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Pedro Calderon de la Barca|Calderon]] scandalized the contemporary literary establishment. Later, compiled in a volume called ''The Eternal Companions'', these essays were pronounced modern classics, their author praised as "the subtlest and the deepest of late XIX – early XX Russian literary critics" by literary historian Arkady Dolinin. ''The Eternal Companions'' became so revered a piece of literary art in the early 1910s that the volume was officially chosen as an honorary gift for excelling grammar school graduates.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Merezhkovsky by Repin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Merezhkovsky in 1890s. Portrait by [[Ilya Repin]] ]]

In May 1890 [[Liubov Gurevich]], the new head of the revamped ''Severny Vestnik'', turned a former narodnik's safe haven into the exciting club for members of the rising experimental literature scene, labeled "decadent" by detractors. Merezhkovsky's new drama ''Sylvio'' was published there, the translation of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s ''[[The Raven (poem)|The Raven]]'' followed suit. Other journals became interested in the young author too: ''[[Russkaya Mysl]]'' published his poem ''Vera'' (later included in his ''The Symbols'' compilation), hailed as one of the Russian Symbolism's early  masterpieces, its colourful mysticism providing a healthy antidote to narodniks's "reflections" of the social life. Bryusov "absolutely fell in love with it," and [[Pyotr Pertsov]] years later admitted: "For my young mind Merezhkovsky's ''Vera'' sounded so much superior to this dull and old-fashioned Pushkin".&lt;ref name="chur_1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

''Russkaya Mysl'' released ''The Family Idyll'' (Semeynaya idillia, 1890), a year later another symbolic poem ''Death'' (Smert) appeared in ''Severny Vestnik''. In 1891 Merezhkovsky and Gippius made their first journey to Europe, staying mostly in Italy and France; the poem ''End of the Century'' (Konetz Veka) inspired by the European trip, came out two years later. On their return home the couple stayed for a while in Guppius' dacha at [[Vyshny Volochyok]]; it was here that Merezhkovsky started working on his first novel, ''[[The Death of the Gods|The Death of the Gods. Julian the Apostate]]''. A year later it was finished, but by this time the situation with ''Severny Vestnik'' has changed: outraged by [[Akim Volynsky]]'s intrusive editorial methods, Merezhkovsky severed ties with the magazine, at least for a while. In the late 1891 he published his translation of Sophocles' ''[[Antigona]]'' in ''Vestnik Evropy'', part of [[Goethe]]'s ''Faustus'' (in ''Russkoye Obozrenye'') and Euripides' ''Hyppolite'' (in ''Vestnik Evropy'' again). The latter came out in 1893, after the couple's second trip to Europe where their first encounter with [[Dmitry Filosofov]] occurred. Merezhkovsky's vivid impressions of Greece and the subsequent spurt of the new ideas provided the foundation for his second novel.&lt;ref name="nico"/&gt;&lt;ref name="magomedo"/&gt;

====The Symbolism manifests====
In 1892 Merezhkovsky's second volume of poetry entitled ''Symbols. Poems and Songs'' came out. The book, bearing E.A.Poe and [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s influences but also tinged with the author's newly found religious ideas, became a younger readership's favourite. Of the elder writers only Yakov Polonsky supported it wholeheartedly.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1892 Merezhkovsky's lecture "The Causes of the Decline of the Contemporary Russian Literature and the New Trends in it" was first read in public, then came out in print. Brushing aside the 'decadent' tag, the author argued that all three "streaks of Modern art" — "Mystic essence, Symbolic language and Impressionism" — could be traced down to the works of [[Lev Tolstoy]] or Dostoyevsky, Russian Modernism, therefore, being a continuation of the Russian literature's classic tradition. Coupled with ''Symbols'', the lecture was widely accepted as Russian symbolism's early manifest.&lt;ref name="dic_lit_bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nico"/&gt; The general reaction to it was mostly negative. The author found himself between the two fires: liberals condemned his ideas as "the new obscurantism," members of posh literary salons treated his revelations with scorn. Only one small group of people greeted "The Causes" unanimously, and that was the staff of ''Severny Vestnik'', which welcomed him back.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893–1894 Merezhkovsky published numerous books (the play ''The Storm is Over'' and the translation of [[Sophocles]]' ''Oedipus the King'' among them), but the money all this hard work brought were scant. Now writing his second novel, he had to accept whatever work was offered to him. In the late 1893 Merezhkovskys settled in Saint Petersburg again. Here they frequented the Shakespearean Circle, the Polonsky's Fridays and the Literary Fund gatherings. Then the pair started their own home salon with Filosofov and [[Akim Volynsky]] becoming habitués. All of a sudden Merezhkovsky found that his debut novel was to be published in ''Severny Vestnik'' after all. What he didn't realise was that this came as a result of a Gippius' tumultuous secret love affair with [[Akim Volynsky]], one of this magazine's chiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

===1895–1903===
[[File:GippiusFlexer.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Gippius and Volynsky, 1890s]]
''The Death of the Gods'' which came out in 1895 (''Severny Vestnik'', Nos.1–6) opened the ''Christ &amp; Antichrist'' trilogy and in retrospect is regarded as the first Russian symbolist novel. Sceptics prevailed (most of them denouncing the author's alleged [[Nietzsche]]anity), but the allies were ecstatic. "A novel made for eternity," Bryusov marveled. Five years later ''Julian the Apostate'' was published in France, translated by Zinaida Vasilyeva.&lt;ref name="magomedo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rulex"/&gt;

Merezhkovsky's relationship with ''Severny Vestnik'', though, again started to deteriorate, the reason  being [[Akim Volynsky]]'s jealousy. In 1896 all three of them (husband still unaware of what was going on behind his back) made a trip to Europe to visit [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s places. Several ugly rows with Volynsky finally prompted Gippius to send her scandalous-minded lover home. Volynsky reacted by expelling his ex-lover's husband from ''Severny Vestnik'' (some sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2TcPe2iV2nsC&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q=volynsky+%22da+vinci%22|title=A History of Russian Symbolism|first=Avril|last=Pyman|date=March 9, 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=August 31, 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; say it was the Merezhkovskys who withdraw their cooperation with the "Severny Vestnik" a year before the magazine shut down in 1898, along with Minsky and Sologub), made sure the major literary journals would shut the door on him and published (in 1900&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QNSYDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q=volynsky+%22da+vinci%22|title=Akim Volynsky: A Hidden Russian-Jewish Prophet|first=Helen|last=Tolstoy|date=December 8, 2016|publisher=BRILL|accessdate=August 31, 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;) under his own name a monograph ''Leonardo da Vinci'', written and compiled by his adversary.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p. 400-404&lt;/ref&gt;

The scandal concerning plagiarism lasted for almost two years. Feeling sick and ignored, Merezhkovsky in 1897 was seriously considering leaving his country for good, being kept at home only by the lack of money. For almost three years the second novel, ''[[The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci|Resurrection of Gods. Leonardo da Vinci]]'' (''The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci'' – in English and French) remained unpublished. It finally appeared in Autumn 1900 in ''[[Mir Bozhy]]'' under the title "The Renaissance". In retrospect these two books' "...persuasive power came from Merezhkovsky's success in catching currents then around him: strong contrasts between social life and spiritual values, fresh interest in the drama of pagan ancient Athens, and identification with general western European culture."&lt;ref name="enc_world_bio"/&gt;

By the time of his second novel's release Merezhkovsky was in a different cultural camp – that of [[Dyagilev]] and his close friends – [[Alexandre Benois]], [[Leon Bakst]], Nikolay Minsky and [[Valentin Serov]]. Their own brand new ''[[Mir Iskusstva]]'' (World of Art) magazine, with Dmitry Filosofov as a literary editor, accepted Merezhkovsky wholeheartedly. It was here that his most famous essay, ''[[L. Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky]]''  was published in 1900–1901, coinciding with the escalation of Tolstoy's conflict with the [[Russian Orthodox church]].&lt;ref name="mih"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chur_2"&gt;{{cite web | author = D.O.Tchurakov | date = | url = http://www.portal-slovo.ru/history/35131.php?ELEMENT_ID=35131&amp;PAGEN_2=2 | title = Russian Decadent movement's esthetic, in the late XIX – early XX century.

===The ''God-seekers'' and ''Troyebratstvo''===
In the early 1900s Merezhkovskys formed the group called the Religious-Philosophical Meetings (1901–1903) based on the concept of the New Church which was suggested by Gippius and supposed to become an alternative to the old Orthodox doctrine, "...imperfect and prone to stagnation."&lt;ref name="nico"/&gt; The group, organized by Merezhkovsky and Gippius along with [[Vasily Rozanov]], [[Viktor Mirolyubov]] and [[Valentin Ternavtsev]], claimed to provide "a tribune for open discussion of questions concerning religious and cultural problems," serving to promote "neo-Christianity, social organization and whatever serves perfecting the human nature." Having lost by this time contacts with both ''Mir Iskusstva'' and ''Mir Bozhy'', Merezhkovskys felt it was time for them to create their own magazine, as a means for "bringing the thinking religious community together." In July 1902, in association with Pyotr Pertsov and assisted by some senior officials including ministers [[Dmitry Sipyagin]] and [[Vyacheslav von Plehve]], they opened their own ''[[Novy Put]]'' (New Path) magazine, designed as an outlet for The Meetings.&lt;ref name="chur_3"&gt;{{cite web | author = Tchurakov, D.O. | date = | url = http://www.portal-slovo.ru/history/35131.php?ELEMENT_ID=35131&amp;PAGEN_2=3 | title = The Esthetics of Russian Decadence in the Late XIX – Early XX Centuries. P. 3 | publisher = www.portal-slovo.ru | accessdate = January 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Triumvirate by Re-Mi.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Troyebratstvo (Gippius, Merezhkovsky and Filosofov) in the early 1910s. Caricature by Re-Mi (Nikolai Remizov)]]
After the 22nd session, in April 1903, the Meetings of the group (by this time known as ''Bogoiskateli'', or God-seekers) were cancelled by the procurator of the [[Holy Synod]] of the Russian Orthodox Church [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]]'s decree, the main reason being Merezhkovsky's frequent visits to places of mass [[Sects|sectarian]] settlements where God-seekers' radical ideas of Church 'renovation' were becoming popular.&lt;ref name="mih"/&gt; In ''Novy Put'' things changed too: with the arrival of strong personalities like [[Nikolai Berdyayev]], [[Sergey Bulgakov]] and [[Semyon Frank]] the magazine solidified its position, yet drifted away from its originally declared mission. In the late 1904 Merezhkovsky and Gippius quit ''Novy Put'', remaining on friendly terms with its new leaders and their now highly influential 'philosophy section'. In 1907 the Meetings revived under the new moniker of The Religious-Philosophical Society, Merezhkovsky once again promoting his 'Holy Ghost's Kingdom Come' ideas. This time it looked more like a literary circle than anything it had ever purported to be.&lt;ref name="chur_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="yanko"&gt;{{cite web | date = | url = http://yanko.lib.ru/books/cultur/encyclopcultXX/m.html#BM10021 | title = Merezhkovsky, D.S. Biography | publisher = yanko.lib.ru | accessdate = January 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple formed their own domestic "church", trying to involve ''miriskusniks''. Of the latter, only Filosofov took the idea seriously and became the third member of the so-called ''Troyebratstvo'' (The Brotherhood of Three) built loosely upon the [[Holy Trinity]] format and having to do with the obscure 12th century idea of the [[Joachim of Fiore|Third Testament]]. Merezhkovsky developed it into the ''Church of the [[Holy Ghost]]'', destined to succeed older churches – first of the Father ([[Old Testament]]), then of the Son ([[New Testament]]).&lt;ref name="chur_2"/&gt; The services at ''Troyebratstvo'' (with the traditional Russian Orthodox elements organized into a bizarre set of rituals) were seen by many as [[blasphemy]] and divided the St. Petersburg intellectual elite: [[Vasily Rozanov]] was fascinated by the thinly veiled eroticism of the happening, Nikolai Berdyaev was among those outraged by the whole thing, as were the (gay, mostly) members of ''Mir Iskusstva''. [[Sergei Diaghilev]] accused Filosofov of committing 'adultery'. The latter in 1905 settled down in Merezhkovskys' St. Petersburg house, becoming virtually a family member.&lt;ref name="Zobnin, p. 402"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chur_2"/&gt;

In 1904 ''[[Peter and Alexis]]'', the third and final novel of ''Christ and Antichrist'' trilogy was published (in ''Novy Put'', Nos.1–5, 9–12), having at its focus the figure of [[Peter the Great]] as an "embodied Antichrist" – an idea the author shared with Russian ''[[raskol]]niki''. The novel's release was now eagerly anticipated in Europe where Merezhkovsky by this time has become a best-selling author, ''Julian the Apostate'' having undergone ten editions (in four years) in France.&lt;ref name="magomedo"/&gt; But when the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' described the novelist as "a heir to Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky's legacy," back in Russia critics denounced this praise so unanimously that Merezhkovsky was forced to publicly deny having had any pretensions of this kind whatsoever.&lt;ref name="krugosvet"/&gt;

===1905–1908===
After the [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]] of January 9, 1905, Merezhkovsky's views changed drastically, the defeat of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] helping him see, as he put it, "the anti-Christian nature of the Russian monarchy." The [[1905 Revolution]] was now seen by Merezhkovsky as a prelude for some kind of a religious upheaval he thought himself to be a [[prophet]] of. The writer became an ardent supporter of the civil unrest, writing pro-revolutionary verse, organizing protest parties for students, like that in [[Alexandrinsky theatre]]. In October 1905 he greeted the government's 'freedoms-granting' decree but since then was only strengthening ties with leftist radicals, notably, [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|esers]].&lt;ref name="volk"&gt;{{cite web| author = Volkogonova, O.| date =| url = http://perfilov.narod.ru/ser_poetry/merez/philosofy.htm| title = Merezhkovsky's Religious Anarchism| publisher  = perfilov.narod.ru| accessdate = August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Merezhkovsky.jpg|thumb|left|200px]]
In ''The Forthcoming Ham '' (Gryadushchu Ham, 1905) Merezhkovsky explained his political stance, seeing, as usual, all things refracted into Trinities. Using the pun ("[[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]]" in Russian, along with a Biblical character's name, meaning 'lout', 'boor') the author described the three "faces of Ham'stvo" (son of Noah's new incarnation as kind of nasty, God-jeering scoundrel Russian): the past (Russian Orthodox Church's hypocrisy), the present (the state bureaucracy and monarchy) and the future – massive "boorish upstart rising up from society's bottom." Several years on the book was regarded as prophetic by many.&lt;ref name="volk"/&gt;

In spring 1906, Merezhkovsky and Filosofov went into a self-imposed European exile in order to promote what they termed "the new religious consciousness." In France they founded ''Anarchy and Theocracy'' magazine and released a compilation of essays called ''Le Tsar et la Revolution''.&lt;ref name="rev_rel"&gt;''Merezhkovsky. D.S.'' [http://russianway.rchgi.spb.ru/Tolstoy/30_merez.pdf Revolution and Religion]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. — russianway.rchgi.spb.ru. — 1907.&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the articles he contributed to it, ''Revolution and Religion'', Merezhkovsky wrote: "Now it's almost impossible to foresee what a deadly force this revolutionary tornado starting upwards from the society's bottom will turn out to be. The church will be crashed down and the monarchy too, but with them — what if Russia itself is to perish — if not the timeless soul of it, then its body, the state?" Again, what at the time was looked upon as dull political grotesque a decade later turned into grim reality.&lt;ref name="krugosvet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="writerstob"/&gt;

In 1908 the play about "the routinous side of the revolution," ''Poppy Blossom'' (Makov Tzvet) came out, all three Troyebratstvo members credited as co-authors. It was followed by "The Last Saint" (Posledny Svyatoy), a study on [[Seraphim Sarovsky]], this time Merezhkovsky's own work.&lt;ref name="rulex"/&gt; More significant were two of his socio-political/philosophical essays, "Not Peace But Sword" and "In Sill Waters". In them, working upon his concept of "the evolutionary mysticism," Merezhkovsky argued that revolution in both Russia and the rest of the world (he saw the two as closely linked: the first "steaming forward," the latter "rattling behind") was inevitable, but could succeed only if preceded by "the revolution of the human spirit," involving the Russian intelligentsia's embracing his idea of the Third Testament. Otherwise, Merezhkovsky prophesied, political revolution will bring nothing but tyranny and the "Kingdom of Ham."&lt;ref name="krugosvet"/&gt;

Among people whom Merezhkovskys talked with in Paris were [[Anatole France]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Bergson]], leaders of the French Socialists. Disappointed by the general polite indifference to their ideas, husband and wife returned home in the late 1908, but not before Merezhkovsky's historical drama ''[[Pavel the First (play)|Pavel the First]]'' (Pavel Pervy) was published. Confiscated and then banned by the Russian authorities, it became the first part of the trilogy ''The Kingdom of the Beast'' (Tsarstvo zverya). Dealing with the nature and history of the Russian monarchy, the trilogy had little in common with the author's earlier symbolism-influenced prose and, cast in the humanist tradition of the 19th-century Russian literature, was seen later as marking the peak of Merezhkovsky's literary career.&lt;ref name="mih"/&gt; The second and the third parts of the trilogy, the [[Decembrists]] novels ''Alexander the First'' and ''December 14'' came out in 1913 and 1918 respectively.&lt;ref name="writerstob"/&gt;

===1909–1913===
In 1909 Merezhkovsky found himself in the center of another controversy after coming out with harsh criticism of ''[[Vekhi]]'', the volume of political and philosophical essays written and compiled by the group of influential writers, mostly his former friends and allies, who promoted their work as a manifesto, aiming to incite the inert Russian intelligentsia into the spiritual revival. Arguing against ''vekhovtsy''{{'}}s idea of bringing Orthodoxy and the Russian intellectual elite together, Merezhkovsky wrote in an open letter to Nikolay Berdyaev:&lt;blockquote&gt;Orthodoxy is the very soul of the Russian monarchy, and monarchy is the Orthodoxy's carcass. Among things they both hold sacred are political repressions, the [ultra-nationalist] [[Union of Russian People]], the death penalty and meddling with other countries' international affairs. How can one entrust oneself to prayers of those whose actions one sees as God-less and demonic?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Merezhkovsky, D.S. | date = 19 September 1909 | url = http://russianway.rchgi.spb.ru/Vekhi1/74_Merezhkovsky.pdf | title = Tempting these Minors (K soblaznu malykh sikh) | publisher = Russian Way site | accessdate = 2010-03-02 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050327020132/http://russianway.rchgi.spb.ru/Vekhi1/74_Merezhkovsky.pdf | archive-date = March 27, 2005 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some argued Merezhkovsky's stance was inconsistent with his own ideas of some five years ago. After all, the ''Vekhi'' authors were trying to revitalize his own failed project of bringing the intellectual and the religious elites into collaboration. But the times have changed for Merezhkovsky and – following this (some argued, unacceptably scornful)&lt;ref name="roschin"&gt;{{cite web | author = Roshchin, Mikhail  | date = | url =http://magazines.russ.ru/october/2000/2/rosch.html | title = The Prince. A Book on Ivan Bunin | publisher = magazines.russ.ru | accessdate = March 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; anti-''Vekhi'' tirade, his social status, too. Shied by both former allies and the conservatives, he was hated by the Church: [[Saratov]] Bishop Dolganov even demanded his [[excommunication]] after the book ''Sick Russia '' was published in 1910.&lt;ref name="semigin"/&gt; For the Social Democrats, conversely, Merezhkovsky, not a "decadent pariah" any-more, suddenly turned a "well-established Russian novelist" and the "pride of the European literature." Time has come for former friend Rozanov to write words that proved in the long run to be prophetic: "The thing is, Dmitry Sergeyevich, those whom you are with now, will never be with you. Never will you find it in yourself to wholly embrace this dumb, dull and horrible snout of the Russian revolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Rozanov, Vasily| date = | url = http://lib.ololo.cc/b/177988/read| title = Fallen Leaves (Opavshiye listya)| publisher = lib.ololo.cc| accessdate = August 13, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1910s Merezhkovsky moved to the left side of the Russian cultural spectrum, finding among his closest associates the esers [[Ilya Fondaminsky]] and, notably, [[Boris Savinkov]]. The latter was trying to receive from Merezhkovsky some religious and philosophical justification for his own terrorist ideology, but also had another, more down to Earth axe to grind, that of getting his first novel published.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.249&lt;/ref&gt; This he did, with Merezhkovsky's assistance – to strike the most unusual debut of the 1910 Russian literary season. In 1911 Merezhkovsky was officially accused of having links with terrorists. Pending trial (which included the case of ''Pavel Pervy'' play) the writer stayed in Europe, then crossed the border in 1912 only to have several chapters of ''Alexander the First'' novel confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.254&lt;/ref&gt; He avoided being arrested and in September, along with Pirozhkov, the publisher, was acquitted.&lt;ref name="rulex"/&gt;

1913 saw Merezhkovsky involved in another public scandal, when Vasily Rozanov openly accused him of having ties with the "terrorist underground" and, as he put it, "trying to sell Motherland to Jews." Merezhkovsky suggested that the Religious and Philosophical Society should hold a trial and expel Rozanov from its ranks. The move turned to be miscalculated, the writer failing to take into account the extent of his own unpopularity within the Society. The majority of the latter declined the proposal. Rozanov, high-horsed, quit the Society on his own accord to respond stingingly by publishing Merezhkovsky's private letters so as to demonstrate the latter's hypocrisy on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.256&lt;/ref&gt;

===1914–1919===
For a while 1914 looked like it was going to be the first ever relatively calm year for Merezhkovsky. With the two ''Complete Works Of'' editions released by the Wolfe's and Sytin's publishing houses, academic [[Nestor Kotlyarevsky]] nominated the author for the [[Nobel Prize for literature]].&lt;ref name="rulex"/&gt; Then [[World War I]] broke out. Merezhkovskys expressed their skepticism as to the Russian involvement in it and the patriotic hullabaloo stirred up by some intellectuals. The writer made a conscious effort to distance himself from politics and succeeded almost, but in 1915 was in it again, becoming friends with [[Alexander Kerensky]] and joining the [[Maxim Gorky]]-led Movement of the patriotic left calling for Russia's withdrawal from the War in the painless possible way.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.414&lt;/ref&gt;

A couple of new Merezhkovsky's plays, ''Joy Will Come'' (Radost Budet) and ''The Romantics'' were staged in war-time [[Petrograd]] theaters. The latter was successful, hit, but for the mainstream critics its author remained a "controversial author." "All in all, the Russian literature is as hostile to me as it had always been. I could as well be celebrating the 25th anniversary of this hostility," the author wrote in his short autobiography for [[Semyon Vengerov]]'s biographical dictionary.&lt;ref name="magomedo"/&gt;

====1917: February and October====
1917 for Merezhkovskys started with a bout of political activity: the couple's flat on Sergiyevskaya Street looked like a secret branch of Russian [[Duma]] (that was when the seeds of a rumour concerning the couple's alleged membership in the Russian [[freemason]] community were sown).&lt;ref name="nico"/&gt; Merezhkovsky greeted the February anti-monarchy revolution and described the Kerensky-led [[Provisional government]] as "quite friendly." By the end of the spring he had become disillusioned with the government and its ineffective leader; in summer he began to speak of the government's inevitable fall and the [[Bolshevik]]'s tyranny coming. The late October saw Merezhkovsky's worst expectations coming to life.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.266&lt;/ref&gt;

For Merezhkovsky the [[October Revolution|October Socialist revolution]] was a catastrophe. He saw it as the Coming of [[Ham]] he wrote about a decade later, the tragic victory for, as he choose to put it, Narod-Zver (The Beast-nation), the political and social incarnation of the universal Evil, putting the whole human civilization to danger. Merezhkovsky and Gippius tried to use whatever influence they retained upon the Bolshevist cultural leaders to ensure the release of their friends, the arrested Provisional government ministers. Ironically, one of the first thing the Soviet government did was lift the ban from anti-monarchist ''Pavel Pervy'' play and it was staged in several Red Russia's theaters.&lt;ref name="krugosvet"/&gt;

For a while Merezhkovskys's flat served as an esers' headquarters but this came to an end in January 1918 when the so-called ''[[Russian Constituent Assembly|Uchredilovka]]'' was dissolved by [[Vladimir Lenin]]. In his 1918 diary Merezhkovsky wrote:{{quote|How fragrantly fresh our February and March were, with their bluish, heavenly blizzards, what a beauty human face shone with! Where is it all now? Peering into the October crowd, one sees that it is faceless. Not the ugliness of it, but facelessness is what's most disgusting. [...] Strolling down the Petersburg streets, I recognize a Communist face at once. What frightens most in it – the self-satisfaction of a satiated beast, animalistic obtuseness? No, the most horrible in this face is its dreariness, this transcendental dreariness, found only in Paradise that's been found on Earth, the Antichrist's Kingdom Come.&lt;ref name="nico"/&gt;}}

In 1919, having sold everything including dishes and extra clothes,  Merezhkovskys started collaborating with Maxim Gorky's new World Literature publishing house, receiving salary and food rations. "Russian Communists are not all of them villains. There are well-meaning, honest, crystal clear people among them. Saints, almost. These are the most horrible ones. These saints stink of the 'Chinese meat' most," Merezhkovsky wrote in his diary.&lt;ref name="nico"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Many people found it inexplicable that amidst mass hunger with no agricultural farms functioning suddenly lots of fresh veal would appear from time to time at market places, sold invariably by the Chinese. This 'veal' was widely believed to be human flesh: that of the 'enemies of the revolution', executed in the [[Cheka]] basements.&lt;/ref&gt;

After news started to filter through of [[Yudenich]], [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak]] and [[Denikin]]'s consequent defeats, Merezhkovskys saw their only chance of survival in fleeing Russia. This they did on December 14, 1919, along with Filosofov and Zlobin (Gippius' young secretary), having obtained [[Anatoly Lunacharsky]]-signed permission "to leave Petrograd for the purpose of reading some lectures on Ancient Egypt to Red Army fighters."&lt;ref name="nico"/&gt;&lt;ref name="writerstob"/&gt;

===Merezhkovsky in exile===
Merezkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov and Zlobin headed first for [[Minsk]], then [[Vilno]], staying in both cities to give newspaper interviews and public lectures. Speaking to a Vilno correspondent, Merezhkovsky commented:&lt;blockquote&gt;The whole question of Russia's existence as such — and it's non-existent at the moment, as far as I am concerned, — depends on Europe's recognizing at last the true nature of Bolshevism. Europe has to open its eyes to the fact that Bolshevism uses the Socialist banner only as a camouflage; that what it does in effect is defile high Socialist ideals; that it is a global threat, not just local Russian disease. ...There is not a trace in Russia at the moment of either Socialism or even the [proclaimed] [[dictatorship of proletariat]]; the only dictatorship that's there is that of the two people: [[Lenin]] and [[Trotsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = | date = | url = http://www.russianresources.lt/archive/Mer/Mer_2.html | title = Speaking to D.S.Merezhkovsky| publisher = www.russianresources.lt | accessdate = 2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Gippius filosofov merezhkovskiy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gippius, Filosofov and Merezhkovsky. Warsaw, 1920]]
In [[Warsaw]] Merezhkovsky did practical work for some Russian immigrant organizations, Gippius edited the literary section in ''Svoboda'' newspaper.&lt;ref name="nico"/&gt; Both were regarding Poland as a "messianic", potentially unifying place and a crucial barrier in the face of the spreading Bolshevism plague. In the summer of 1920 Boris Savinkov arrived into the country to have talks with [[Jozef Pilsudski]]: he engaged Merezhkovsky and Filosofov in the activities of the so-called Russian Evacuation committee (more of a White Army mobilization center) and introduced the writer to the Polish President. On behalf of the Committee Merezhkovsky issued a memorandum calling the peoples of Russia to stop fighting the Polish army and join its ranks. The whole thing flopped, though, as Poland and Russia reached the armistice agreement. Merezhkovskys and Zlobin left for France, Filosofov staying in Warsaw to head the Savinkov-led Russian National committee's anti-Bolshevik propaganda department.&lt;ref name="wulf"&gt;{{cite web | author = Wulf, Vitaly | date =  | url = http://mylove.ru/arsmoriendi/diary/view/?id=48141 | title = The Decadent Madonna | publisher = mylove.ru | accessdate = February 14, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727085732/http://mylove.ru/arsmoriendi/diary/view/?id=48141 | archivedate = July 27, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris Merezhkovsky founded the Religious Union (later Soyuz Neprimirimykh, the Union of the Unpacified), was holding lectures, contributed to [[Pavel Milyukov]]'s ''Poslednye Novosty'' and [[Pyotr Struve]]'s ''Osvobozhdenye'' newspapers, exposing what he saw as the Bolshevist lies and denouncing the "Kingdom of Antichrist."&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.313-315&lt;/ref&gt; It was becoming more and more obvious, though, that Merezhkovsky, backed only by the circle of friends, was in isolation, misunderstood by some, abhorred by others. His calling for the international intervention into Russia angered the left; rejecting the restoration of the Russian monarchy antagonized the right.&lt;ref name="volk"/&gt; His single ally at the time was [[Ivan Bunin]]; never sharing much personal affinity, the two men formed an alliance in their relentless anti-Soviet campaign. Besides, having maintained strong contacts with influential French politics lobbying the interests of the Russian immigrants, both ensured that the Russian writers should get some financial support from the French government. A couple of years later another sponsor was found in [[Tomas Garrigue Masaryk|Tomas Masaryk]] who granted personal pensions to some prominent figures in the immigrant Russian writers' community.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.419-420&lt;/ref&gt;

Merezhkovsky insisted upon severing all the [[International PEN]]'s contacts with Communist Russia and cancelling French help for the victims of mass hunger in Russian [[Volga Region]] arguing, not unreasonably, that those in need won't ever see any of the money or food sent. He criticised the exiled Russian Constituent Assembly's communique which was, in his opinion, too conciliatory in tone. In 1922 the collection of articles and essays of the four authors (Merezhkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov contacts with whom have been restored, and Zlobin) came out under the title ''The Kingdom of Antichrist'', the general idea of the book being that the 'Russian fires', globalist in their nature and intent, promise "either brotherhood in slavery or the end in a common grave" for the European nations.&lt;ref name="terapiano"&gt;Terapiano, Yuri. Sundays at Merezhkovskys and The Green Lamp Group. Distant Shores. Portraits of Writers in Exile. Memoirs. — Moscow, Respublica Publishing House, 1994. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

In winter 1925 a small literary and philosophy circle was formed by Merezhkovsky and Gippius; two years later it was officially launched as the Green Lamp group. With the ''Novy Korabl'' (The New Ship) magazine of its own, the group attracted the whole of the Russian intellectual elite in exile and was remaining the important cultural center for the next ten years. "We are the Criticism of Russia as such, the latter's disembodied Thought and Conscience, free to judge its present and foresee its future," wrote Merezhkovsky of the Green Lamp mission.&lt;ref name="volk"/&gt;

In 1928 at the First Congress of Russian writers in exile held in [[Belgrade]], King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] bestowed Merezhkovsky with the Order of Savva of the 1st Degree meriting his services for world culture. A series of lectures organised for Merezhkovsky and Gippius by the [[Serbian Academy]] signalled the launch of the Yugoslav-based "Russian Library" series, where the best works of Bunin, Merezhkovsky, Gippius, [[Alexander Kuprin]], [[Aleksey Remizov]], [[Konstantin Balmont]], [[Ivan Shmelyov]] and [[Igor Severyanin]] came out over the next several years.&lt;ref name="nico"/&gt; Things started to deteriorare in the early 1930s; with the Czech and the French grants withdrawn and much feared Socialists rising high on the French political scene, Merezhkovskys looked southwards and found there a sympathizer in [[Benito Mussolini]] who took great interest in the work and views of a Russian writer, now a multiple Nobel Prize for literature nominee.&lt;ref name="volk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.327&lt;/ref&gt;

====Merezhkovsky's literary activities: 1925–1941====
In the mid-1920s, disappointed by the Western cultural elite's reaction to his political manifestos, Merezhkovsky returned to religious and philosophical essays, but in the new format, that of a monumental free-form experimental-styled treatise. Some of his new books were biographies, some just extensive, amorphous researches in ancient history.&lt;ref name="krugosvet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.422-423&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of the first two of them, ''The Birth of Gods. Tutankhamen in Crete'' (1925) and ''Messiah'' (1928), Merezhkovsky thus explained his credo: "Many people think I am a historical novelist, which is wrong. What I use the Past for is only searching for the Future. The Present is a kind of exile to me. My true home is the Past/Future, which is where I belong."&lt;ref&gt;''Zveno'' (The Link) magazine. March 16, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the three fundamental books Merezhkovsky created in the late 1920s early 1930s another trilogy took shape, loosely linked by the concept of man's possible way to salvation. ''The Mystery of the Three: Egypt and Babylon'' ([[Prague]], 1925) was followed by the ''Mystery of the West: Atlantis-Europe'' ([[Berlin]], 1930), where the cherished Third Testament idea took an apocalyptic, [[Nietzsche]]an turn. The third, ''Unfamiliar Jesus'' (1932, Belgrade), is seen in retrospect as the strongest of the three.&lt;ref name="krugosvet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="menh"&gt;{{cite web | author = Menh, Alexander | date =  | url = http://www.svetlana-and.narod.ru/lekzia.html | title = Dmitry Merezhkovsky and Zinaida Gippius (Lecture) | publisher = www.svetlana-and.narod.ru | accessdate = February 15, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/61Avpv5cB?url=http://www.svetlana-and.narod.ru/lekzia.html | archivedate = August 24, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of a sudden Merezhkovsky, a prolific writer again, drifted into the focus of the Nobel Prize committee attention. From 1930 onwards [[Sigurd Agrell]], professor of Slavic languages in [[Lund University]], started to methodically nominate Merezhkovsky for the Prize, although, invariably (and rather frustratingly for both), in tandem with Ivan Bunin. In November 1932 Gippius in a letter to Vera Bunina expressed her opinion that Merezhkovsky had no chance of winning "because of his anti-Communist stance," but the truth was, Bunin (no lesser a Communism-loather than his rival) wrote books that were more accessible and, generally, popular. Merezkovsky even suggested they should make a pact and divide the money should one of them ever win, but Bunin took seriously what was meant apparently as a joke and responded with outright refusal. He won the Prize in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.426&lt;/ref&gt;

Agrell continued nominating Merezhkovsky up until his own death in 1937 (making eight such nominations, in all), but each year the latter's chances were getting slimmer. The books he produced in his latter years (like the compilation of religious biographies ''Faces of Saints: from Jesus to Nowadays'' and ''The Reformers'' trilogy, published posthumously) weren't ground-breaking. Hard times and deepening troubles notwithstanding, Merezhkovsky continued to work hard until his dying day, trying desperately to complete his ''Spanish Mysteries'' trilogy; the last of the three pieces, the unfinished ''Little Theresa'', was with him at his deathbed; he died literally with a pen in his hand.&lt;ref name="volk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.329&lt;/ref&gt;

====Merezhkovsky and the European dictators====
Although never a [[Russian nationalism|nationalist]], Merezhkovsky was a Russo-centric author and thinker, cherishing the idea of his country's unique and in many ways decisive place in the world culture in history. Never tiring of reiterating the "Russian plight is the problem of the world, not Russia" postulate, he was ever on the look-out for some 'strong leader' who would be able to organize and successfully see through the anti-Communist crusade. For a while Merezhkovsky thought he had found his hero in [[Benito Mussolini]] who, having sponsored his book on [[Dante]], had several lengthy talks with the Russian writer on politics, literature and art. Impressed, Merezhkovsky started to see his new friend almost as an incarnation of Dante. In a letter addressed to Mussolini, he wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;The best, the truest and the liveliest document on Dante is — your personality. To understand Dante one has to live through him, but only you being around makes that possible. Two souls, his and yours, are merged into one, Infinity itself bringing you two together. Visualize Mussolini in contemplation, and it's Dante. Imagine Dante in action, and it's Mussolini.&lt;ref name="krugosvet"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All the while Merezhkovsky was trying to convince Mussolini that it was the latter's mission to start the "Holy War against Russia" (the idea formed the basis of his article "Meeting Mussolini", published by ''Illustrated Russia'' in February 1937). Seeing his name frequently mentioned by the Italian press in connection with bizarre Merezhkovsky's suggestions made [[duce]] uneasy and he took a step back. Visiting Rome in summer 1937, Merezhkovsky had talks with the Italian Foreign minister, but failed to meet Mussolini. Then came the disillusionment, and in October of the same year he was already speaking of how disappointed he was with the Italian leader's "petty materialism." He tried to contact General [[Francisco Franco]], now seeing Spain as the last anti-Communist citadel of Europe and failed. Thus Merezhkovsky's choice of the new European "heroes" narrowed down to [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.427&lt;/ref&gt;

Merezhkovsky had never seen [[Fascism]] as an alternative to Communism. As early as 1930 he wrote of doomed Europe stuck between the two "stores of explosives: Fascism and Communism," expressing hope that some day these two evils will somehow destroy one another.&lt;ref name="nico"/&gt; But the danger of Fuhrer's possible taking over Europe was still the lesser evil for him than the possible Communist expansion.&lt;ref name="volk"/&gt; The "Hitler dilemma" was the only thing husband and wife have ever disagreed on. Gippius hated and despised Fuhrer, referring to him as "an idiot". Merezhkovsky thought he found a leader who'd be able to take the whole of Antichrist Kingdom upon himself, this outweighing for him such trivia as the fact that his own ''Joan of Arc'' (1939) was banned in Germany on the day of its release.&lt;ref name="terapiano"/&gt;

In summer 1939 [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] (in collaboration with the French Association des Auteurs de Films) bought Merezhkovsky's scenario ''The Life of Dante''. The production was cancelled on September 1, as [[World War II]] broke out in Europe. On September 9, fleeing the air raids, the Merezhkovskys moved to  [[Biarritz]] in the South of the country where they spent the next three months, communicating mainly with the French and the English military officers, but also with [[Irina Odoyevtseva]] and her husband [[Georgy Ivanov]].&lt;ref name="Zobnin, p.385"&gt;Zobnin, p.385&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27 Biarritz got occupied. Here in a hotel on August 14 the writer's 75th anniversary celebration was held, organized by a group of French writers, with some notable Russians like Pavel Milyukov, Ivan Bunin and [[Mark Aldanov]] invited. It was there that Merezhkovsky made comments which (according to biographer Yuri Zobnin) were later presented by some memoirists as his "infamous German radio speech". Still, even Zobnin admits that there were reasons to regard him a Nazi sympathizer. In the Autumn of 1941 Merezhkovsky found himself in the center of his German admirers – students, mostly, but army officers too. It was their German friends who helped the couple move back to Paris from Biarritz where they found themselves penniless and on the verge of homelessness. "Merezhkovsky flew up to the [[Nurnberg]] fires with the agitation of a newly born butterfly... By this time most of us stopped visiting them," wrote {{ill|Vasily Janowski|ru|Яновский,_Василий_Семёнович}}, a Green Lamp group member.&lt;ref name="Zobnin, p.385"/&gt;

=====The "infamous radio speech"=====
Exactly how and why did Merezhkovsky found himself on the German radio in June 1941 nobody was quite sure of. Gippius (according to Yury Terapiano who was quoting [[Nina Berberova]]) was blaming her own secretary Vladimir Zlobin who, using his German connections, allegedly persuaded the elderly man to come to the studio in the early days of the Nazi invasion into the [[USSR]]. In his speech (if its printed version entitled ''Bolshevism and Humanity'' is to be believed) Merezhkovsky, comparing Hitler to [[Joan of Arc]], called for the anti-Bolshevik crusade, reiterating, among other things, what he was saying all through the 1920s and 1930s:&lt;blockquote&gt;Bolshevism will never change its nature... because right from the start it's been not a national, but international phenomenon. From the very first day Russia has been – and remains to this very day – only a means to the end: that of its conquering the whole world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"This is the end for us," Gippius allegedly commented, disgusted and horrified.&lt;ref name="volk"/&gt; In the days to come, though, husband and wife (as those who knew them later attested) were often expressing horror at the news of Nazis' atrocities on the Eastern front; according to Gippius' friend, poet Victor Mamchenko, Merezhkovsky far from supporting Hitler, in those days was actually condemning him.&lt;ref name="volk"/&gt;

Biographer Zobnin doubts the fact that Merezhkovsky has been on the German radio at all, noting that none of the memoirists who mentioned it had himself heard Merezhkovsky speaking on air. All of those 'witnesses' were invariably referring to the printed version of the "speech" published in 1944 by ''Parizhsky Vestnik''. This document, according to Zobnin (the author of the first  comprehensive Merezhkovsky biography published in Russia) was most certainly a montage fake, concocted by the Nazi propaganda out of the 1939 unpublished essay ''The Mystery of the Russian Revolution'' (on Dostoyevsky's ''[[Demons]]'' novel), bits and pieces thrown in. The researcher insists such speech could not have been broadcast in the late June: the couple resided in Biarritz and for an elderly person to give everybody a slip and somehow get to Paris was hardly probable.&lt;ref name="Zobnin, p.383-384"&gt;Zobnin, p.383-384&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding to the confusion is the well-documented fact that Merezhkovsky has already made one speech mentioning Hitler and Joan of Arc in one breath. It happened in August 1940 at his 75th birthday celebration in Biarriz, and in a different context. In fact, his speech caused trouble because it was deemed too pro-Russian and anti-German. According to [[Teffi]], one of the people present, — {{quote|On the huge hotel terrace under the guidance of countess G., the audience gathered, German uniform seen here and there. Merezhkovsky pronounced a lengthy tirade which rather frightened the Russian camp. Targeting both bolsheviks and the [German] fascists, he spoke of the times when the nightmare finally ends, both Antichrists – one tormenting Russia, the other tormenting France – perish, and the 'Russia of Dostoyevsky' at last will be able to stretch a hand to the 'France of Pascal and Joan of Arc'. "Well, now they'll throw us out of the hotel, that's for sure," horrified Russian lodgers were whispering. But the Germans looked as if they never heard this prophecy: they applauded benevolently, along with others.&lt;ref name="Zobnin, p.383-384"/&gt;}}
[[Irina Odoyevtseva]] independently corroborated this. "He was going on about the Atlantis and its demise. For those who understood Russian it was obvious that what he meant was Germany's defeat and Russia's imminent victory, but the Germans never understood this and applauded," she remembered.&lt;ref&gt;''Kolonitskaya, А.'' All is Clean for a Clean Beholder. Talks with Irina Odoyevtseva. Moscow, 2001. P. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; All this, according to Zobnin, makes the "infamous German radio speech" looking very much like a Nazi propaganda myth, picked up first by Yuri Terapiano, then authenticised by numerous reiterations.&lt;ref name="Zobnin, p.383-384"/&gt;

====Merezhkovsky's death====
For the last three months of his life Merezhkovsky was working continuously in the couple's Paris flat, trying to finish ''Little Theresa''. On December 6 husband and wife returned from one of their regular walks and spent the evening, in Gippius' words, "arguing, as usual, about Russia versus freedom dilemma." Skipping both supper and his habitual evening cigarette, Merezhkovsky went to his room early. Next morning the maid called Gippius to tell her the man was in some kind of trouble. Merezhkovsky was sitting unconscious next to a cold fireplace. The doctor arrived in 15 minutes' time and diagnosed [[brain hemorrhage]]. In half an hour Merezhkovsky was pronounced dead. "...Me, I'm a worm, not man, slandered by humans, despised by peoples (Ps. 21, 7). But wrap itself into a chrysalis a hapless worm does only to break out as a shiny white, sunlight-like, resurrected butterfly," these were his last written words found on a piece of paper on a table. The funeral service was held on December 10 in the Orthodox church of Saint [[Aleksandr Nevsky]]. Dmitry Merezhkovsky was buried at the [[Sainte-Genevieve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery]], with just several people attending the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p.385-388&lt;/ref&gt;

==Merezhkovsky's ideas==
Merezhkovsky's first adopted philosophical trend was the then popular [[positivism]]. Soon, disillusioned in this idea, although never rejecting it wholly, Merezhkovsky turned to religion.&lt;ref name="chur_1"/&gt; Seeds of this hybrid (European positivism grafted to what's been described as "the subjective idealism" of Russian Orthodoxy) sown on the field of literature study brought forth a brochure entitled "On the Causes of the Decline and the New Trends in Contemporary Russian Literature". This manifesto gave a burgeoning Russian Symbolist movement both ideology and the name as such: Merezhkovsky was the first in Russia to speak of [[symbol]]s as definitive means of cognizance in modern Art.&lt;ref name="chur_1"/&gt;

In the center of this new train of thought was the notion of "rejecting the rational in favour of the intuitive" by means of exploiting what the author termed as "spirituality of a symbol," seeing the latter as a perfect means of describing Reality, otherwise unfathomable. Only through a symbol, according to Merezhkovsky, one could get to an object's deeper meaning, whereas (quoting, as he did, [[Tyutchev]]) "thought, whilst being spoken, turns a lie":&lt;ref name="chur_2"/&gt; {{quote|In poetry the unspoken things, flickering through the beauty of symbol, affect us stronger than what's expressed by words. Symbolism endows both style and essence of poetry with spirituality; poetic word becomes clear and translucent as walls of [[alabaster]] [[amphora]] carrying flame... Longing for things that have never been experienced yet, looking for undertones yet unknown, searching out dark and unconscious things in our sensual world is the coming Ideal poetry's main characteristics. [...] The three principal elements of the new art are: the mystic essence, symbolism and the expansion of artist's impressiveness.&lt;ref name="lect"&gt;{{cite web | author = Merezhkovsky, D. | date = | url = http://www.ad-marginem.ru/article12-page5.html | title = On the Causes of the Decline and the New Trends in Contemporary Russian Literature. P.1 | publisher = www.ad-marginem.ru | accessdate = 2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Dmitry Merezhkovsky.}}
According to scholar D.Churakov, Merezhkovsky, pronouncing "the death of metaphysics" and putting forward the idea that only language of symbols could be an adequate instrument for discovering the modern world's pattern of meanings, was unwillingly following [[Auguste Comte]], the difference being that the latter was employing these ideas in scientific fields, while the former proposed to use them in literature and criticism.&lt;ref name="chur_2"/&gt;

===The Third Testament===
Merezhkovsky's next and most fundamental step ahead as a self-styled modernist philosophy leader was taken in tandem with his young intellectual wife Zinaida Gippius who from the first days of their meeting started generating new ideas for her husband to develop. Thus the Third Testament theory was born, or rather revived, transplanted from its Middle Ages Italian origins into the early 20th century's Russian ambience. It was the Third Testament that formed the basis of the early 20th-century Russian New Religious Consciousness movement which in turn kick started the Religious-Philosophical Society into action, again Gippius producing basic ideas for her husband to formulate. Borrowing the original idea from [[Joachim of Fiore]], a 12th-century theologist, Merezhkovskys created and developed their own concept of man's full-circle religious evolution. In it the Bible was seen as a starting point with God having taken two steps towards Man, for the latter to respond with the third, logically conclusive one.&lt;ref name="volk"/&gt;

According to Merezhkovsky, the First (Divine Father's) and the Second (Divine Son's) Testaments could be seen only as preliminary steps towards the Third one, that of the Holy Ghost. With the first maintaining the Law of God and the second – the Grace of God, what the third Testament should do is bring Liberation to the human race; the First Testament revealing God's power as the gospel Truth, the Second transforming the gospel Truth into Love, the Third translating Love into Liberation. In this last Kingdom "pronounced and heard will be – the final, never before revealed name of the coming one: God the Liberator," according to the author.&lt;ref name="krugosvet"/&gt;

Merezhkovsky saw the Third Testament as a synthesis of the two original revelations: that "about Earth" (pre-Christian beliefs) and that "about Heaven" (Christianity). The Mystery of the Holy Trinity, when resolved, should link three elements into a circle, the great "new Earth under the new Heavens," as promised in the Book of the Apocalypse. As Rozanov put it, "Merezhkovsky's greatest innovation was this attempt to merge together the two — the Christian and the Heathen — poles of poignancy. To discover a 'tempting vice' in the greatest of virtues and the greatest of virtues in the tempting vice."&lt;ref name=" rozan_2"&gt;{{cite web | author = Rozanov, V.V. | date =  | url = http://russianway.rchgi.spb.ru/Merezhkovsky/rozan_2.html | title = Among the Foreign. D.S.Merezhkovsky | publisher = russianway.rchgi.spb.ru | accessdate = January 2, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051104002657/http://russianway.rchgi.spb.ru/Merezhkovsky/rozan_2.html | archive-date = November 4, 2005 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This New Trinity concept implied that the all-inviting Holy Ghost was not a sexless spirit, but a female entity.&lt;ref name="volk"/&gt;

====Sex and spirituality====
Human history, according to Merezhkovsky, was one ceaseless "battle of two abysses": the abyss of Flesh (as discovered by pre-Christians) and the abyss of Spirit (opened by Christianity's sexless [[ascetism]]). Pre-Christians celebrated flesh-driven sensuality at the expense of spirituality. Ascetic Christians brought about the rise of Spirit, at the expense of sex. Merezhkovsky declared the dialectical inevitability of thesis and antithesis' coming together, of the spiritual and the sexual poles uniting on a higher, celestial level.&lt;ref name="vehi"&gt;{{cite web |author= Lossky, N. | date = | url = http://www.vehi.net/nlossky/istoriya/23.html | title = Dmitry Sergeevich Merezhkovsky (1865—1941) | publisher = www.vehi.net | accessdate = January 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his own words, "Being aware of myself in my body, I'm at the root of personality. Being aware of myself in the other one's body, I'm at the root of sex. Being aware of myself in all human bodies, I am at the root of unity".&lt;ref name="vehi"/&gt; Noticing that one of the [[Aramaic]] languages translates Spirit as Rucha, a female entity, Merezhkovsky interpreted the Holy Trinity as Father and Son's unity in the higher being, their common godly Mother. It is the latter's Kingdom Come that the Third Testament was supposed to lead to. Seeing both God and man as intrinsically unisexual, Merezhkovsky regarded a male/female schism to be a symptom of imperfection, the cause for primal human being's fatal disintegration.&lt;ref name="vehi"/&gt;

In the modern times, according to Merezhkovsky, both monastic and ascetic Christianity will cease to exist. Art would not just adopt religious forms, but become an integral part of religion, the latter taken in broader concept. Human evolution as he saw it, would lead to merging of whatever had been polarized: sex and spirit, religion and culture, male and female, et cetera — bringing about Kingdom Come, not 'out there', but 'here on Earth'.&lt;ref name="vehi"/&gt;

===Merezhkovsky and "religious anarchism"===
Man's evolutional progress towards the Third Testament Kingdom Come won't be without some revolutionary upheavals, according to Merezhkovsky, will be strewn with "catastrophes", most of them dealing with the "revolution of Spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Merezhkovsky, D.S. The Seven Humble Ones (Sem smirennykh). The Complete D.S.Merezhkovsky, Vol. XV. I.D.Sytin's Publishing house. Moscow, 1914&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of such revolution would bring about gradual change in the nature of religion itself, the latter taking under its spacious wing not only man's sensual liberation but also the latter's "freedom of rebellion." "We are human only as long as we're rebels," Merezhkovsky insisted, expressing what some saw as a proto-[[Existentialism|existentialist]] idea.&lt;ref name="volk"/&gt;

One result of the "revolution of Spirit" should be the severing of ties between state and religion, according to Merezhkovsky. "The Church – not the old, but the new, eternal, universal one – is as opposite to the idea of the state as an absolute truth is opposing an absolute lie," he declared in an open letter to Berdyaev.&lt;ref&gt;Merezhkovsky, D.S. The New Religious Action. An Open Letter to N.A.Berdyayev. P. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

B.Rozental, analyzing Merezhkovsky's political and religious philosophy, thus summed up the writer's position: "The Law amounts to violence... The difference between legitimate power that holds violence 'in reserve' and violence itself is but a matter of degree: sinful are both. Autocracy and murder are nothing more than the two extreme forms of exhibiting [criminal] power."&lt;ref name="chur_3"/&gt; Interpreting the Biblical version of the human history as a sequence of revolutionary events, Merezhkovsky saw religion and revolution as inseparable. It is just that for a social revolution to succeed, spiritual revolution should always come one step ahead of it. In Russia the lack of the latter brought about the former's fiasco, with Antichrist taking hold of things, he argued.&lt;ref name="volk"/&gt;

In the 1920s Merezhkovsky lost interest in the religious anarchism doctrine. In his later years he became close to [[ecumenical]] ideals, prophesying the Kingdom Come as a synthesis of "Peter, Paul and John's principles", that is, bringing [[Catholic]], [[Protestant]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] traditions together.&lt;ref name="volk"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Throughout his lifetime Dmitry Merezhkovsky polarized opinion in his native Russia, bringing upon himself both praise and scorn, occasionally from the same quarters. According to [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]], Merezhkovsky became Russia's first ever "new-type, universal kind of a dissident who managed to upset just about everybody who thought themselves to be responsible for guarding morality and order":{{quote|Tsarist government saw Merezhkovsky as subverting the state foundations, patriarchs of official Orthodoxy regarded him a heretic, for literary academia he was a decadent, for Futurists – a retrograde, for Lev Trotsky, this ardent global revolution ideologist, – a reactionary. Sympathetic Anton Chekhov's words came and went unnoticed: 'A believer he is, a believer of an apostolic kind'.''&lt;ref name="evt"&gt;{{cite web | author = Yevtushenko, Yevgeny| date = April 28, 2005 | url =http://2005.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2005/31n/n31n-s24.shtml | title = Dmitry Merezhkovsky. Between Sharikov and Antichrist | publisher = 2005.novayagazeta.ru | accessdate = 2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the words of a modern biographer, "he will find his place in history alongside [[Marquis de Sade]], [[Nietzsche]] and [[Henry Miller]], those classics who only through being condemned and ostracized by the many could be approached and appreciated by the few."&lt;ref name="nico"/&gt; "I was disliked and scolded in Russia, loved and praised abroad, but misunderstood, both here and there," Merezhkovsky wrote in a letter to Nikolai Berdyaev.&lt;ref name="evt"/&gt;

Merezhkovsky has been given credit for his exceptional erudition, the scientific approach to writing, literary gift and stylistic originality.&lt;ref name="mih"/&gt; Seen in retrospect as the first ever (and, arguably, the only one) Russian "cabinet writer of a European type," Merezhkovsky was, according to Berdyayev, "one of the best-educated people in Saint Petersburg of the first quarter of the 20th century."&lt;ref name="menh"/&gt; [[Korney Chukovsky]], pondering on the dire state of the early 20th century Russia's cultural elite, admitted that "the most cultured of them all" was this "mysterious, unfathomable, almost mythical creature, Merezhkovsky".&lt;ref name="chukovsky"&gt;{{cite web | author = Chukovsky, K. | date =  | url = http://russianway.rchgi.spb.ru/Merezhkovsky/chukovsky.html | title = D.S.Merezhkovsky. An Object-seer (Tainovidets veshchi) | publisher = russianway.rchgi.spb.ru | accessdate = January 2, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051104003253/http://russianway.rchgi.spb.ru/Merezhkovsky/chukovsky.html | archive-date = November 4, 2005 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anton Chekov insisted that the Russian Academy of Sciences should appoint Merezhkovsky its honorary academic, in as early as 1902.&lt;ref name="evt"/&gt;

Merezhkovsky was the first in Russia to formulate the basic principles of Symbolism and Modernism, as opposed to 'decadence', a tag he was battling with.&lt;ref name="chur_1"/&gt; Never aspiring to a leading role in the movement, he soon became, according to I. Koretskaya, "a kind of handy encyclopedia for the ideology of Symbolism," which others "could borrow aesthetic, socio-historical and even moral ideas from."&lt;ref name="magomedo"/&gt; Having added a new ("thought-driven") dimension to the genre of historical novel and turning it into a modern art form, Merezhkovsky influenced [[Andrey Bely]] and [[Aleksey Remizov]], as well as [[Valery Bryusov]], [[Aleksey N. Tolstoy]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]] and [[Mark Aldanov]]. It was Merezhkovsky who introduced such concepts as a "modernist novel" and a "symbolic historical novel" to the conservative Russian literature scene of the late 1890s.&lt;ref name="krugosvet"/&gt;

Merezhkovsky was praised as an engaging essayist and "a master of quote-juggling." Some critics loathed the repetitiveness in Merezhkovsky's prose, others admired his (in a broad sense) musical manner of employing certain ideas almost as [[symphonic]] themes, which was new at the time.&lt;ref name="menh"/&gt;

No less influential, even if so much more controversial, were Merezhkovsky's philosophical, religious and political ideas. Alongside the obvious list of contemporary followers (Bely, Blok, etc.; almost all of them later became detractors) deeply interested in his theories were political figures (Fondaminsky, Kerensky, Savinkov), psychologists ([[Freud]]), philosophers (Berdyaev, [[Heinrich Rickert|Rickert]], [[Fyodor Stepun|Stepun]]), lawyers ([[Maksim Kovalevsky|Kowalewsky]]). [[Thomas Mann]] wrote of Merezhkovsky as of a "genius critic and specialist in a world psychology, second only to Nietzsche."&lt;ref name="semigin"/&gt; Notable other Germans influenced by Merezhkovsky included [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]] and [[Alfred Rosenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern, ''The Politics of Cultural Despair: A Study in the Rise of Germanic Ideology'' p 190 UCP, Berkeley, 1974. {{ISBN|0-520-02626-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later researchers noted Merezhkovsky's willingness to question dogmas and thwart tradition with disregard to public opinion, never shying controversy and even scandal. Crucial in this context (according to O.Dafier) was his "quest for ways of overcoming deep crisis which came as a result of the Russian traditionalist Church losing its credibility."&lt;ref name="chur_1"/&gt;

===Criticism===
In Russia the general response to Merezhkovsky's literary, cultural and social activities was negative.&lt;ref name="nico"/&gt; His prose, even if on the face of it stylistically flawless and occasionally accessible, was, critics argued, an elitist thing unto itself, "hermetically closed for the uninitiated majority."&lt;ref name="krugosvet"/&gt; "Having isolated himself from the real life, Merezhkovsky built up the inner temple for his own personal use. Me-and-culture, me-and-Eternity – those were his recurring themes," wrote in 1911 [[Leon Trotsky]].&lt;ref name="trotzky"&gt;{{cite web | author = Trotsky, L. | date =22 May 1911 | url     =http://www.magister.msk.ru/library/trotsky/trotl490.htm | title = Мережковский | publisher  = Kiyevskaya mysl (newspaper) Nos. 137, 140  | accessdate = February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For all his scientifically strict, academic approach to the process of collecting and re-processing material, contemporary academia, with little exception, ridiculed Merezhkovsky, dismissing him as a gifted charlatan, bent on rewriting history in accordance with his own current ideological and philosophical whims.&lt;ref name="menh"/&gt; Due to his incorrigible, as many saw it, tendency towards inconsistency, Merezhkovsky's old allies were deserting him, while new ones approached him warily. Vasily Rozanov wrote in 1909: {{quote|Merezhkovsky is a Thing that ceaselessly speaks; a jacket and trousers combination producing a torrent of noise...  To clear grounds for more speaking activity, once in three years he undergoes a total change of mental wardrobe and for the following three years busies himself in defying all things he was maintaining previously.&lt;ref name="nico"/&gt;}}
Another former friend, Minsky, questioned Merezhkovsky's credibility as a critic, finding in his biographies a tendency to see in his subjects only things that he wanted to see, skillfully "re-moulding questions into instant answers."&lt;ref name="minsky"&gt;{{cite web | author = Minsky, N.M. | date =  | url = http://russianway.rchgi.spb.ru/Merezhkovsky/minsky.html | title = The Absolute Reaction. Leonid Andreev and Merezhkovsky | publisher = russianway.rchgi.spb.ru | accessdate = February 14, 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051104002222/http://russianway.rchgi.spb.ru/Merezhkovsky/minsky.html | archive-date = November 4, 2005 | dead-url = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For all his religiosity, Merezhkovsky was never popular with either Russian Orthodox Church officials or the religious intellectual elite of the time, people like [[Sergey Bulgakov]], [[Pavel Florensky]] and [[Lev Shestov]] fiercely denouncing his ideas and projects.&lt;ref name="semigin"/&gt; Similarly, the reputation of a radical Social democrat hasn't made Merezhkovsky popular in the leftist literary camp. He was variously described as "an anti-literature phenomenon" ([[Viktor Shklovsky]]), "the greatest corpse in the Russian literature" ([[Razumnik Ivanov-Razumnik|Ivanov-Razumnik]]) and "a book-worm", totally "foreign to all things human" (Korney Chukovsky).&lt;ref&gt;Zobnin, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer's work published in emigration was, according to the 1934 Soviet Literary encyclopedia "the telling example of the ideological degradation and cultural degeneration of the White emigres."&lt;ref name="enc_1934"&gt;{{cite web | year =1934| url  =http://feb-web.ru/feb/litenc/encyclop/le7/le7-1931.htm | title = D.S.Merezhkovsky | publisher = The Literary Encyclopedia | accessdate = February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maxim Gorky's verdict: "Dmitry Merezhkovsky, a well-known God-admirer of a Christian mode, is a small man whose literary activity is akin to that of a type-writer: each type is clear and well-read, but it's soul-less and boring," served as a leitmotif of the Soviet literary officialdom's view on Merezhkovsky for decades. In the Soviet times the writer was (in the words of [[Alexander Men]]) "aggressively forgotten,"&lt;ref name="menh"/&gt; his works unofficially banned up until the early 1990s, when the floodgate of re-issues opened the way for serious critical analysis of Merezhkovsky's life and legacy.&lt;ref name="nico"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3184">'''Dragoș Protopopescu''' (1892, [[Călăraşi]] – 1948) was a [[Romania]]n writer, poet, critic and philosopher. He was professor at the [[University of Chernivtsi]].

Politically Protopopescu supported the [[Fascism|fascist]] and [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] organization known as the [[Iron Guard]], and he published the newspaper ''[[Buna Vestire]]'', which was aligned with the Guard. He also actively contributed to other Romanian newspapers such as ''[[Flacăra]]'', ''[[Vieaţa Nouă]]'', ''Cuget Românesc'', ''[[Cuvântul]]'', ''[[Gândirea]]'', ''Lumea Nouă'', ''Cuvântul Studențesc'', ''[[Vremea]]'' and ''[[Porunca Vremii]]''.

Protopopescu was the director of the National Theater in [[Chernivtsi]] (1926-1927), and also a press attaché at the Romanian Legation in London (1928-1930).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://editura.mttlc.ro/carti/protopopescu-valoarea-latina-a-culturii-engleze.pdf|title=Dragos Protopopescu-Valoare latina a literaturii engleze|language=Romanian|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protopopescu was arrested and imprisoned in spring 1938 during the crackdown on the Iron Guard by [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]]'s dictatorship. In 1948 he was arrested again by the [[Communist Romania|communist authorities]]. He tried to commit suicide by cutting his veins. He was sent to a hospital and then arrested again. He made a new and successful attempt at suicide: leaning over an elevator shaft, he was decapitated by the cabin.

A holder of a [[PhD]] in English studies (with a thesis about [[William Congreve]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://editura.mttlc.ro/carti/protopopescu-valoarea-latina-a-culturii-engleze.pdf|title=Valoarea latina a culturii engleze|language=Romanian|accessdate=April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from the [[Paris University]], he was for a while dean of the School of English Language and Literature, Department of Letters, [[University of Bucharest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/IONPAPUCian6.htm|title=CEEA CE ŞTIU|last=Papuc|first=Ion|language=Romanian|publisher=[[Convorbiri Literare]]|accessdate=April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eliseo Verón''' (June 12, 1935 – April 15, 2014) was an Argentine [[Sociology|sociologist]], [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] and [[Semiotics|semiotician]], and professor of [[communication sciences]] at [[University of San Andrés|Universidad de San Andrés]]. His work is known mainly in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[French language|French]]-speaking countries.

__TOC__

==Academic career==
He was born in Buenos Aires, where he studied at the [[University of Buenos Aires|university]], and began teaching philosophy and sociology as a student from 1957. In 1960, he received a degree in [[philosophy]] at the University of Buenos Aires. After graduation, he obtained a scholarship from [[National Scientific and Technical Research Council|CONICET]] to study Social Anthropology Laboratory at the [[Collège de France]] with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]. Verón was in charge of the first translation into [[spanish language|spanish]] of ''Structural Anthropology'', an anthology of Lévi-Strauss's work on [[Structural Anthropology|that subject]], published by Editorial Universitaria de Buenos Aires (Eudeba)  in 1961. He recognizes Lévi-Strauss as his main influence during this period. In 1962 he attended a seminar by [[Roland Barthes]] at the [[Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes]], where he discovered [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurian]] semiotics, which became a point of departure for him in future work.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Eliseo Verón, by Carlos Alberto Scolari and Paolo Bertetti, ''Alambre'', No. 1, March 2008. http://www.revistaalambre.com/Articulos/ArticuloMuestra.asp?Id=13&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to Argentina, Verón became a professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Buenos Aires. In 1967 and 1968, he directed the Center for Social Research at the [[Torcuato di Tella Institute]]. He was professor of [[Social Psychology]] at the [[Universidad Nacional del Litoral]] and Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Salvador]]. In 1970, he won the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} During the 1970s, he settled in France, where he lived until 1995. He taught at several universities in France (Paris, Bordeaux, Bayonne) and in 1985 received his degree of [[Doctor of State]] at the [[University of Paris VIII]]. He was professor at the [[Sorbonne]] between 1987 and 1992.

In 1995 he returned to Argentina and directed the graduate program in communication sciences at the [[Universidad Hebrea Argentina Bar Illán]]. He also taught communication sciences this same discipline taught at the [[Universidad Nacional de Rosario]], the [[Universidad Nacional del Sur]], the [[University of Fribourg]] and the [[University of San Andrés]]. Between 2000 and 2006, he directed the Master of Journalism program at the University of San Andrés, a joint project with the [[Clarín Group]] and [[Columbia University]].

Verón has published books on sociology, social psychology, communication and semiotics since 1968. His early period was influenced by the structuralism of Claude Lévi-Strauss and the binary theory of the sign of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], and then the triadic sign theory of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], on whom he relied to develop his theory of social semiosis (1988).

In 1974 he founded the journal ''LENGUAjes'' in Buenos Aires, along with Oscar Steinberg, Juan Carlos Indart, and Oscar Traversa. The publication of this journal was the effective introduction of semiotics in Argentina.

Between 1970 and 1978, Verón was president of the Argentine Association of Semiotics.

==Political activity==
In December 2010, Verón made a speech contributing to the launch of [[Eduardo Duhalde]], who ran for [[president of Argentina]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/politica/elecciones/Duhalde-lanzo-candidatura-Argentina-sedienta_0_394160640.html |title= Duhalde lanzó su candidatura y dijo que "Argentina está sedienta de paz"|author= [[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]|date= December 21, 2010|accessdate=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Equo''' (also spelled '''Q''', or '''eQuo''') is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[List of political parties in Spain|political party]] founded on 4 June 2011, when 35 different Spanish [[Green party|green parties]] agreed to merge into EQUO. It began as a foundation on 24 September 2010 with the goal of becoming "the seed and source of debate about [[political ecology]] and [[social equity]], originating a sociopolitical movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equova.org/%C2%BFquienes-somos/|title=Who are we?|accessdate=9 December 2011|language=Spanish}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first election it contested was the [[Spanish general election, 2011]], obtaining 216,748 votes (0.9%), making it the 9th most supported party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elecciones.mir.es/resultadosgenerales2011/99CG/DCG99999TO_L1.htm|title=Results of the 2011 Spanish general election|language=Spanish|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was fifth in Madrid,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elecciones.mir.es/resultadosgenerales2011/99CG/DCG12999CM_L1.htm|title=Results for the 2011 Spanish general election in the Community of Madrid|language=Spanish|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; achieving representation thanks to the Valencian coalition [[Compromís-Q]], in which EQUO participated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2011/11/20/actualidad/1321809046_683977.html|title=Equo goes in the Congress, but only thanks to Compromís|language=Spanish|accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Catalonia]], the [[European Green Party]] is represented by the [[Initiative for Catalonia Greens]].

At the [[Spanish general election, 2015|national elections of 20 December 2015]] EQUO joined the list of Podemos. This resulted in seats for three EQUO candidates: [[Juan López de Uralde|Juantxo López de Uralde]], Rosa Martínez and Jorge Luis Bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.partidoequo.es/equo-entra-en-el-congreso-con-3-escanos|title=EQUO entra en el Congreso con 3 escaños|work=partidoequo.es|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was a featured columnist for the [[Des Moines Register]] during the years 1914-1915.&lt;ref&gt;http://roghiemstra.com/day.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, his successful life took a radical shift in course.  He divorced his wife of eight years and left the professional ministry.  He moved to New York and began writing for the [[New York Globe]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven B.

Harbour, The Philosopher and the Lecturer: John Dewey, Everett Dean Martin, and Reflective Thinking., Education and Culture, Vol. 29 (1), 2013, pp.105-124.&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin's second marriage in 1915 to Persis Eastman Rowell also ended in divorce, they had one son, Everett Eastman.&lt;ref&gt;Hannan, Caryn, Illinois Biographical Dictionary, 2008-2009 Edition, Volume One., State History Publications, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commentary on the early 20th century ==
In ''The Behavior of Crowds'' (1920), his first nationally reviewed book, he posed what he saw as the dilemma of the modern age: a technological information revolution that made it possible, in the absence of an adequate educational system, to influence ignorant men and women with [[propaganda]] and half-truths.  Unscrupulous [[demagogues]], corrupt politicians, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] advertisers, and revolutionary [[ideologues]] found ready-made audiences when they appealed to the baser (a subconscious urge, behavior, or intuition directed by primeval, animalistic, self-serving, and/or ignoble motivations) instincts.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Dean Martin: liberal in adult education|https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42589283.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was a [[Classical liberalism|classical]], [[individualistic]] [[Liberalism|liberal]], in the tradition of the [[Renaissance]] [[humanists]] and the authors of [[The Federalist Papers]]. He believed in restrained government and in the self-selection of intellectually promising students through appropriate programs of adult education.

His most famous and widely read work, ''The Meaning of a Liberal Education'', appeared in 1926, the same year he helped found the American Association for Adult Education.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Dean Martin: liberal in adult education|https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42589283.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  When his book, ''The Meaning of a Liberal Education'' was released in 1926, [[Frederick Paul Keppel]], the president of the [[Carnegie Corporation]] proclaimed it as “the most important contribution to the understanding of [[adult education]]… this far in the United States.”&lt;ref&gt;Day, M., J, &amp; Seckinger, D. (1987, May 21–23). Everett Dean Martin: Spiritual leader of the adult education movement in the United States.  Paper presented at the Adult Education Research Conference Proceedings, Laramie, Wyoming.&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 1928, [[John Dewey]] responded to a request from [[Marie Mattingly Meloney]], editor of the [[New York Herald-Tribune]] Sunday Magazine, and offered his recommendations on recently published texts on education.  [[John Dewey|Dewey]] wrote, “I think the best educational books of recent publication are…Martin, ''The Meaning of a Liberal Education''.  This was not the first time [[John Dewey|Dewey]] recommended Everett Dean Martin’s book.  In 1927, the editors of the Journal of the [[National Education Association]] approached [[John Dewey|Dewey]] and asked, “What book have you recently found especially worthwhile?  Something that you have read easily, eagerly, and with profit, either in the field of education or out of it.”  [[John Dewey|Dewey]] identified two books; one of them was Martin’s ''The Meaning of a Liberal Education''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Day and Clifford P. Harbour, The Philosopher and the Lecturer: John Dewey, Everett Dean Martin, and Reflective Thinking., Education and Culture, Vol. 29 (1), 2013, pp.105-124.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appointments ==
From 1919-1922, Martin served as chairman of The [[National Board of Review]] of Motion Pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, A.D. (1999). Everett Dean Martin. In J.A. a. C. Garraty, Mark C. (Ed.), American National Biography (Vol. 14, pp. 589-591). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was an instructor and lecturer at [[The New School for Social Research]] in [[New York City]] from 1921-1929, and served on the Board of Directors of [[The New School]] from 1925-1932.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;  He taught classes in sociology, psychology, social behavior, and adult education.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[The New School]], Martin taught alongside other prominent intellectuals of the day including, [[Alfred Adler]], [[Norman Angell]], [[Harry Elmer Barnes]], [[Charles Austin Beard]], [[Edwin Grant Conklin]], [[Herbert J. Davenport]], [[John Dewey]], [[Lawrence K. Frank]], [[Felix Frankfurter]], [[Alexander Goldenweiser (anthropologist)|Alexander Goldenweiser]], [[Joseph Jastrow]], [[Alvin Saunders Johnson]], [[Horace Kallen]], [[Alfred Kreymborg]], [[Eduard C. Lindeman]], [[Walter Lippmann]], [[Frederick Macaulay]], [[Wesley Clair Mitchell]], [[Gorham Munson]], [[Moissaye Joseph Olgin]], [[Harry Allen Overstreet]], [[James Harvey Robinson]], [[Mark Van Doren]], [[Thorstein Veblen]], and [[Leo Wolman]].&lt;ref&gt;The Survey, “The New School, A Laboratory of Social Sciences.” (Advertisement), Volume 46, August 16th, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the courses Martin taught at [[The New School]] between 1921 and 1929 were: Introduction to Social Psychology, Fundamental Problems in Adult Education, The Process of Adult Learning, Psychology and the Problems of Social Behavior, Some Applications of Social Psychology, Studies on Social Behavior, and Psychological Problems of Social Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of Martin’s lecture topics in from a 1925 course on [[social philosophy]] taught at [[The New School]] include: The [[Psychology]] of the [[Crowd psychology|Crowd]]; The So-Called [[Collective consciousness|Group Mind]]; Has Man a Social or [[Herd behavior|”Herd”]] Instinct?; The [[Psychology]] of Mass Appeal; Leadership in the [[Crowd psychology|Crowd]]; Reform Legislation; The Present Industrial Transition.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Why is this seminal individual virtually ignored amidst the ranks of the founders of the [[adult education]] movement?  Apparently Martin’s wholehearted commitment to liberal education has placed him in juxtaposition with the early proponents of practical education in the eyes of contemporary scholars.  Here is an individual virtually dismissed not only in the history of [[adult education]], but also in the contemporary exploration of [[adult education]].”&lt;ref&gt;Steven B. Frye, “Everett Dean Martin: Misunderstood Champion of Adult Education,” Carson-Newman Studies, Vol. X, No 3, Fall 2004, pp. 84-98, ISSN 1081-7727.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those recruited to the programs of the [[Charles Sprague Smith|People's Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6n0522b&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Cooper Union]] during Martin’s tenure as Director (1926-1934) had been [[Mortimer Adler]], [[Scott Buchanan]], [[Will Durant]], [[Clifton Fadiman]], and [[Hilda Worthington Smith]], all soon to surpass Martin in fame and influence.  Yet, in his heyday, Martin was regarded as one of the leading figures in [[adult education]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Dean Martin: liberal in adult education|https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42589283.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Morse A. Cartwright, who was the Executive Director of the American Association for Adult Education from its founding in 1926 to its ultimate dissolution and transformation in 1949, considered Martin to be the "spiritual father" of the association in particular and of the entire movement in general.&lt;ref&gt;Morse A. Cartwright, "Everett Dean Martin," Journal of Adult Education, 13 (1941): 324&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright went on to say in his eulogy for Martin, published in the Journal of Adult Education, that:

“. . . Thousands who had heard him lecture in all parts of the United States, more thousands who had read his numerous books and articles on philosophical and psychological subjects, and the large audience which for years listened to his notable Friday night addresses and discussions in the Great Hall of [[Cooper Union]] in New York, all attested to the challenging qualities of his mind and heart.”&lt;ref&gt;Morse A. Cartwright, "Everett Dean Martin," Journal of Adult Education, 13 (1941): 324&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 Martin was asked to direct the Department of Social Philosophy at the [[Cooper Union]] in [[New York City|New York]] through a $15,000 per year grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation]] through his long-time friend [[Frederick Paul Keppel]].  Martin remained in this position until 1936 when he accepted an opportunity to move to California and direct an experimental program in teaching at [[Claremont Colleges]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven B. Frye, “Everett Dean Martin: Misunderstood Champion of Adult Education,” Carson-Newman Studies, Vol. X, No 3, Fall 2004, pp. 84-98, ISSN 1081-7727.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was a Professor of [[Social Psychology]] at [[Scripps College]] in [[Claremont, California]] from 1936 up until his death in 1941.

== Death ==
Martin died on May 10, 1941 of a heart attack in [[Claremont, California]] at the age of 60.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Dean Martin: liberal in adult education|https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42589283.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin's third wife, Daphne Crane Drake, whom he married in 1931, survived him.&lt;ref&gt;Hannan, Caryn, Illinois Biographical Dictionary, 2008-2009 Edition, Volume One., State History Publications, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mrs. Everett Dean Martin (Daphne Crane Drake) was a former President of the Child Study Association of America (1934).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bankstreet.edu/archives/special-collections/csaa-collection/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/programs/child-welfarechild-labor/child-study-association-of-america-statement-of-purpose-1913/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6963jbx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gǎnyìng''''' or '''''yìng''''' is a [[Chinese culture|Chinese cultural]] keyword meaning a "correlative resonance" pulsating throughout the purported force field of ''[[qi]]'' that infuses the cosmos. When the idea of ''ganying'' first appeared in [[Chinese classics]] from the late [[Warring States period]] (475-221 BCE), it referred to a [[cosmological]] principle of "stimulus and response" between things of the same kind, analogous with vibratory [[sympathetic resonance]]. Early schools of [[Chinese philosophy]] adapted ''ganying'' into different folk theories of [[causality]], such as universal resonance influencing all interrelated things in [[Daoism]], and ethical resonance between Heaven and humans in [[Confucianism]]. ''Ganying'' resonance was later used to mean miraculous "moral retribution" in [[Chinese folk religion]], and "prayers being heard" in [[Chinese Buddhism]]. In the [[Modern history|modern period]], Chinese ''ganying'' "stimulus and response" was used to translate some Western scientific [[loanwords]] (such as ''diàncí gǎnyìng'' 電磁感應 "[[electromagnetic induction]]").

==Terminology==
The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[collocation]] ''gǎnyìng'' combines ''gǎn'' [[wikt:感|感]] "feel, sense; move, touch; ([[traditional Chinese medicine]]) be affected (by cold)" and ''yìng'' traditional [[wikt:應|應]] or simplified [[wikt:应|应]] "respond; consent, comply; adapt to; cope/deal with; apply, applied", which is also pronounced ''yīng'' "promise/agree (to do something); answer; respond; ([[Auxiliary verb|auxiliary]]) should; ought to" (DeFrancis 2003: 284, 1149).

Several early texts (below) use an interchangeable synonym of ''ying'' &lt; [[Old Chinese ]] ''*[q](r)əәŋ'' 應 "respond; resonate" : ''dòng'' &lt; *''[Cəә-m-]tˤoŋʔ'' 動 "move; shake; set in motion". ''Dong'' can mean ''ganying'', for instance, ''gǎndòng'' 感動 "move; touch (somebody)" and ''dòngrén'' 動人 "arouse interest/feelings". Sharf (2002: 120) says interpreting the Chinese philosophical term ''gan'' "stimulus; affect; etc." is rendered problematic by the modern distinction between [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]]. The ontological range of meanings, insofar as to ''gan'' someone is to effect the mind of another person, as evident in the (c. 121 CE) ''[[Shuowen jiezi]]'' dictionary definition of ''gan'' as 動人心也 "to move a person's mind", suggesting English translation equivalents such as "incite," "agitate," "rouse," and "stimulate". The epistemological range of ''gan'' meanings, insofar as it implies an inner experience or cognition that may or may not correlate with an event in the external world, is translatable as to "feel," "experience," "sense," or "become aware of."

Both the [[Chinese characters|logographs]] ''gǎn'' 感 and ''yìng'' 應 are classified as [[Chinese character classification#Phono-semantic compound characters|radical-phonetic characters]] written with the "[[radical 61|heart-mind radical]]" 心 (typically used to write words for feelings and thoughts) and phonetic indicators of ''xián'' 咸 "all; Hexagram 31" and ''yīng'' 鷹 "hawk; eagle" minus the "[[radical 196|bird radical]]" 鳥 (Bishop 2012).

Bilingual Chinese-English dictionaries give a variety of translation equivalents for [[Modern Standard Chinese]] ''ganying''. 
*moved to response through the feelings and affections; induction (Mathews 1931)
*① to feel and respond ② (physics) induction (Liang and Chang 1971) 
*reaction or response to some outer stimuli (Lin 1972)
*① response; reaction; interaction ② [biology] irritability ③ [electricity] induction (Wu 1979)
*① response ② [electricity] induction (Ding 1985)
*① response; reaction; interaction ② [biology] irritability ③ [electricity] induction (Wu 1993)
*① induction; process through which an object or electromagnetic body becomes magnetized when in a magnetic field or in the magnetic flux set up by a magnetmotive force ② response; reaction; feeling or act of response caused by an outside influence (Ling 2002)
*① [philosophy] response; reaction; interaction ② [biology] irritability ③ [electricity] induction ④ [religion] the prayers being listened to (DeFrancis 2003)
*(A) respond (B) [electricity] induction (Kleeman &amp; Yu 2010) 
The most commonly given (and copied) meanings are "respond; response" and "electromagnetic induction".

==History== 
The history of ''ganying'' spans over two millennia, going from an ancient cosmological theory to modern [[scientific terminology]].

Ancient texts use [[string resonance]] or [[sympathetic vibration]] between paired [[List of Chinese musical instruments|Chinese musical instruments]] as the most common analogy for ''(gan)ying'' "cosmic resonance". The ''Zhuangzi'', ''Lüshi chunqiu'' (twice), ''Huainanzi'' (twice), and ''Chuci'' all mention plucking the classical [[pentatonic]] ''gong'' 宮 and ''jue'' 角 notes on the ''[[Se (instrument)|se]]'' 瑟 "a 25-string zither"; but the ''Chunqiu fanlu'' mentions the ''gong'' and ''shang'' 商 notes on either the ''se'' or ''[[Guqin|qin]]'' 琴 "a 7-string zither".  [[Joseph Needham]] (1962:130) notes both these instruments are commonly mistranslated as "[[lutes]]", but are actually "[[zither]]s", describing the ''qin'' as "a half-tube zither" and the ''se'' (which only survives in the descendent ''[[Guzheng|zheng]]'' 箏) as "a horizontal [[psaltery]]". In modern terms of the [[solmization]] stave, ''gong'', ''shang'', and ''jue'' correspond to ''do'', ''re'', and ''mi''.

The earliest records of ''ganying'' are in [[Chinese classics]] from the late [[Warring States period]] (475-221 BCE), when the "[[Hundred Schools of Thought]]" developed competing philosophical doctrines, including correlative resonance.

===Yijing===
In the (c. 4th-3rd century BCE) ''[[Yijing]]'' "Classic of Changes", the "Commentary on the Decision" for [[List of hexagrams of the I Ching#Hexagram 31|Hexagram 31]] [[File:Iching-hexagram-31.svg|25px]] ''Xian'' 咸 "Influence (Wooing)" uses ''ganying'' 感應 to explain the [[Old Chinese]] phonetic connection between *''[g]ˤr[əә]m'' 咸 "all; everywhere" and *''kˤ[əә]mʔ'' 感 "move emotionally".
&lt;blockquote&gt;INFLUENCE [咸] means stimulation [感]. The weak is above, the strong below. The forces of the two stimulate and respond [感應] to each other, so that they unite. Keeping Still and joyousness. The masculine subordinates itself to the feminine. Hence it is said: "Success. Perseverance furthers. To take a maiden to wife brings good fortune." Heaven and earth stimulate each other, and all things take shape and come into being. The holy man stimulates the hearts of men, and the world attains peace and rest. If we contemplate the outgoing stimulating influences, we can know the nature of heaven and earth and all beings. (tr. Wilhelm and Baynes 2011: 540-541) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Le Blanc (1985: 9, 140) says the roots for the "key notion" of resonance can be traced back to the older strata of the ''Yijing'', citing an early saying preserved in [[List of hexagrams of the I Ching#Hexagram 1|Hexagram 1]] ''[[Qian (hexagram)|Qian]]'' 乾's line interpretation.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nine in the fifth place means: "Flying dragon in the heavens. It furthers one to see the great man." What does this signify? The Master said: Things that accord in tone vibrate together [同聲相應, repeated in ''Zhuangzi'' below]. Things that have affinity in their inmost natures seek one another [同氣相求]. Water flows to what is wet, fire turns to what is dry. Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger. Thus the sage rises, and all creatures follow him with their eyes. What is born of heaven feels related to what is above. What is born of earth feels related to what is below. Each follows it kind. (tr. Wilhelm &amp; Baynes 2011: 382) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Xiaojing===
The (c. 400 BCE) ''[[Classic of Filial Piety|Xiaojing]]'' "Classic of Filial Piety" has a section named ''Ganying'' 感應, translated as "The Influence of Filial Piety and the Response to It" (Legge) or "Feeling and Responding by the Sprits" (Feng). It begins with an explanation of how the gods and spirits respond to human activities,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Master said, "Anciently, the intelligent kings served their fathers with filial piety, and therefore they served Heaven with intelligence. They served their mothers with filial piety, and therefore they served Earth with discrimination. They pursued the right course with reference to their (own) seniors and juniors, and therefore they secured the regulation of the relations between superiors and inferiors (throughout the kingdom). When Heaven and Earth were served with intelligence and discrimination, the spiritual intelligences displayed (their retributive power)." (16, tr. Legge 1879: 484-485) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Xunzi===
The (3rd century BCE) Confucian classic ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]'' repeats the above ''Yijing'' folk-etymology that the ''xian'' &lt; *''[g]ˤr[əә]m'' hexagram is the phonetic in the character for ''gan'' 感 &lt; *''kˤ[əә]mʔ'' "stimulate' influence".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The hexagram ''Xian'', "All", of the ''Changes'' shows the relation of husband to wife. The Way of relations between husband and wife cannot be allowed to be incorrect, for it is the root source for the relations between lord and minister, father and son. The hexagram ''Xian'' [咸] means "influence" [感]. It uses the high to descend to the low, the male to descend to the female. It is weak and pliant above and strong and hard below." (27.38, tr. Knoblock 1994: 216) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Xunzi'' uses ''ganying'' "joint resonance" to explain the harmonious connection between a person's ''xing'' 性 "inborn nature" and ''jing'' 精 "essence; senses".
&lt;blockquote&gt;These are the common names that apply to man. That which is as it is from the time of birth is called the nature of man [性]. That which is harmonious from birth, which is capable of perceiving through the senses and of responding to stimulus spontaneously [精合感應] and without effort, is also called nature [性]. The likes and dislikes, delights and angers, griefs and joys of the nature are called emotions [情]. When the emotions are aroused and the mind makes a choice from among them, this is called thought [慮]. (22, tr. Watson 2003: 139) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Zhuangzi===
The (c. 3rd-2nd centuries BCE) Daoist classic ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' contains an early version of the zither string resonance analogy, which Sharf (2002: 83) describes as undoubtedly "the single most persuasive demonstration of the principle of resonance".

Zhuangzi tells the story to his friend [[Hui Shi|Huizi]] in order to explain that the five predominant schools of philosophy, [[Confucianism]], [[Mohism]], [[Yangism]], [[School of Names]], and "Pingism" [uncertain]), merely debate like the five notes of the [[Music of China|pentatonic scale]], while [[Daoism]] contains and transcends them like an untuned note that resonates all 25 strings of the ''[[Se (instrument)|se]]'' 瑟 zither.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Well, then," said Master Chuang, "there are the four schools of the Confucians, the Mohists, the Yangists, and the Pingists. Adding yours, master, it makes five. Which of you is actually right? Or may it be someone like Hasty Ninny [Lu Ju 魯遽]? His disciple said to him, 'I have attained your way, master. In winter I can light a cooking fire under a three-legged vessel and in summer I can make ice'. 'That's merely to attract [召] yang with yang and yin with yin'; said Hasty Ninny. 'It's not what I mean by the Way. I will show you my Way.' Thereupon he tuned two zithers. He placed one of them in the hall and the other in an inner chamber. When he plucked the note ''do'' [宮] on one, ''do'' resonated [動] on the other, and when he plucked the note ''mi'' [角] on one, ''mi'' resonated [動] on the other. It's because their harmonies were the same. If he had retuned one of the strings so it didn't match any note in the pentatonic scale, and had then plucked it, all twenty-five strings on the other zither would have resonated [動] , not because there was any fundamental difference in the sound, but because it was the note that dominated all the rest. May it be that you thinkers are all like this?" (23, tr. Mair 1994: 243) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

One ''Zhuangzi'' context uses ''gan'' with ''ying'': "The sage walks with heaven in life and evolves with things in death. In stillness, he shares the same integrity as yin; in movement, he shares the same current as yang. He is not the founder of fortune, nor is he the initiator of misfortune. He responds [應] when affected [感], moves when pressed, and arises only when he has no other choice. He rids himself of knowledge and precedent, conforming to the principle of heaven." (15, tr. Mair 1994: 145).

Two others use ''ying'' to describe acoustic resonance: "Similar categories follow each other [同類相從] and similar sounds respond to each other [同聲相應]. Indeed, this is the principle of heaven." (31, tr. Mair 1994: 319), "To one who does not dwell in himself, the forms of things will manifest themselves. His movement is like water, his stillness is like a mirror. His response is like an echo [其應若響], indistinct as though it were absent, quiet as though it were pure." (33, tr. Mair 1994: 341).

=== Lüshi chunqiu===
Two chapters of [[Lü Buwei]]'s (c. 240 BCE) wide-ranging ''Lüshi chunqiu'' "The Annals of Lu Buwei" repeat the ''ying'' 應 "[[acoustic resonance]]" zither-string analogy, and explain how phenomena that are of the same ''lei'' 類 "kind; category" mutually ''zhao'' 召 "resonate; attract" one another. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Things belonging to the same category naturally attract each other [類同相召]; things that share the same ethers [''qi'' 氣] naturally join together; and notes that are comparable naturally resonate [應] to one another. Strike the note ''gong'' [宮] on one instrument and other strings tuned to the ''gong'' note will vibrate [應]; strike the note ''jue'' [角] and other strings tuned to the ''jue'' note will vibrate [應]. Water flowing across leveled earth will flow to the damp places; light evenly stacked firewood, and the fire will catch where it is driest. Clouds above a mountain look like shrubs; above water they resemble fish scales; above an arid landscape they look like leaping fire; above a flood they resemble rolling waves. Without exception, everything manifests signs that show men it shares the same category with that which creates it. Thus, "use the dragon to bring rain, and use a form to pursue a shadow. Wherever an army has camped, brambles and briars are sure to grow." The natural occurrence of fortune and misfortune is considered by the masses to be a matter of destiny, but how could they know its true source? (13.2, tr. Knoblock and Riegel 2000: 283-284) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Things belonging to the same category naturally attract each other [類同相召]; things that share the same ethers naturally join together; and musical notes that are close naturally resonate with one another [應]. Thus, strike the note ''gong'' [宮] on one instrument, and other strings tuned to the note ''gong'' will respond [應], or strike the note ''jue'' [角], and the other strings tuned to the note ''jue'' will vibrate [動]. Use the dragon to bring rain, Use a form to pursue a shadow. The natural occurrence of fortune and misfortune is considered by the masses to be a matter of destiny; but how could they know its true source? Hence, when a state is in disorder, it does not merely remain in disorder but attracts bandits. Were it only to remain disordered, it would not necessarily perish; but since it attracts bandits, there is no means by which it could survive. (2.40, tr. tr. Knoblock and Riegel 2000: 522-523) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Xinzhong Yao]]'s encyclopedia of Confucianism (2003 2: 613) defines ''ganying'' as "a mutual resonance or mutual sympathy between two or more phenomena", and says that  in the ''Lüshi chunqiu'', "the actions of the ruler elicit certain responses from Heaven, which are manifested through omens. In this system of resonances, the depth of the sovereign's moral cultivation is directly proportional to the prosperity of the realm." The ancient Chinese view that anomalies in the heavens, disturbances on earth, earthquakes, avalanches, sightings of unusual animals, and other such "wonders" (怪) were omens of the king's behavior has been termed "[[phenomenalism]]" by Western sinologists (Sharf 2002: 88).

==Han dynasty==
During the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE-220 CE), scholars and philosophers adapted the notion of ''ganying'' into different fields. For Han cosmologists, ''ganying'' was important in both human-cosmos and state-cosmos correspondences. During the Han era, Henderson (1984: 37) says both imperial ideology and political criticism rested on a world view shaped by correlative cosmology, which facilitated the wide dissemination of correlative modes of thinking among members of the politically-engaged Han elite.

===Chuci===
The (c. 3rd century BCE-2nd century CE) ''[[Chuci]]'' "Songs of [[Chu (state)|Chu]]" poem "Reckless Remonstrance" gives examples of cosmic resonance in acoustics, biology, and [[Chinese mythology|mythology]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like sounds harmonize together [同音者相]; Creatures mate with their own kind. The flying bird cries out to the flock; The deer calls, searching for his friends. If you strike ''gong'', then ''gong'' responds [應]; If you hit ''jue'', then ''jue'' vibrates. The tiger roars, and the wind of the valley comes; The dragon soars, and the radiant clouds come flying. (tr. Hawkes 1985: 257) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare the ''Yijing'' (above) saying, "Things that accord in tone vibrate together [同聲相應] ... Clouds follow the dragon, wind follows the tiger."

===Chunqiu fanlu===
The ''[[Chunqiu Fanlu]]'' "Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals", which is attributed to the Confucianist [[Dong Zhongshu]] (179-104 BCE) but compiled later, describes how humans are in a system of relationships with the cosmos, and elevates the notion of resonance to "a full-fledged cosmological theory" (Sharf 2002: 84). This concept was called ''tian-ren ganying'' 天人感應 "resonance between Heaven and humans", a phrase that first appears in the (3rd-century CE) ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms#Book of Wei .28.E9.AD.8F.E6.9B.B8.29|Book of Wei]]'' history of Emperor [[Cao Pi]] (r. 220-226), and was later used as the title of another text attributed to Dong Zhongshu: "[[Interactions Between Heaven and Mankind]]". Dong Zhongshu is sometimes credited with having formalized the doctrine of ''ganying'' and giving it classical expression (Henderson 1984: 24).

Chapter 57 ''Tunglei xiangdong'' 同類相動 "Mutual Activation of Like Categories" also uses the zither string resonance analogy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;If water is poured on level ground it will avoid the parts which are dry and move towards those that are wet. If (two) identical pieces of firewood are exposed to fire, the latter will avoid the damp and ignite the dry one. All things reject what is different (to themselves) and follow what is akin. Thus it is that if (two) [''qi''] are similar, they will coalesce; if notes correspond, they resonate [應]. The experimental proof [驗] of this is extraordinarily clear. Try tuning musical instruments. The ''kung'' [宮] note or the ''shang'' [商] note struck upon one lute will be answered by [應] the ''kung'' or the ''shang'' notes from other stringed instruments. They sound by themselves. This is nothing miraculous [神], but the Five Notes being in relation; they are what they are according to the numbers [數] (whereby the world is constructed). (Similarly) lovely things summon others among the class of lovely things; repulsive things summon others among the class of repulsive things. This arises from the complementary way in which a thing of the same class responds [類之相應而起也] as for instance if a horse whinnies another horse whinnies in answer [應], and if a cow lows, another cow lows in response [應]. When a great ruler is about to arise auspicious omens first appear; when a ruler is about to be destroyed, there are baleful ones beforehand. Things indeed summon each other, like to like, a dragon bringing rain, a fan driving away heat, the place where an army has been being thick with thorns. Things, whether lovely or repulsive, all have an origin. (If) they are taken to constitute destiny (it is because) no man knows where that origin is. . . It is not only the two [''qi''] of the Yin and the Yang which advance and retreat [進退] according to their categories. Even the origins of the varied fortunes, good and bad, of men, behave in the same way. There is no happening that does not depend for its beginning upon something prior, to which it responds because (it belongs to the same) category, and so moves [而物以類應之而動者也] ... (As I said) when the note ''kung'' is struck forth from a lute, other ''kung'' strings (nearby) reverberate of themselves in complementary (resonance) [應]; a case of comparable things being affected according to the classes to which they belong [此物之以類動者也]. They are moved by a sound which has no visible form, and when men can see no form accompanying motion and action, they describe the phenomenon as a 'spontaneous sounding' [自鳴]. And wherever there is a mutual reaction [相動] without anything visible (to account for it) they describe the phenomenon as 'spontaneously so' [自然]. But in truth there is no (such thing as) 'spontaneously so' (in this sense). (I.e. everything in the universe is attuned to certain other things, and changes as they change.) That there are (circumstances which) cause a man to become what in fact he is, we know. So also things do have a real causative (power), invisible though this may be. (1, tr. Needham 1954: 281-282) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Needham (1956: 281) explains the importance of pattern and organism in Dong Zhongshu's philosophy: "The symbolic correlations or correspondences all formed part of one colossal pattern. Things behaved in particular ways not necessarily because of prior actions or impulsions of other things, but because their position in the ever-moving cyclical universe was such that they were endowed with intrinsic natures which made that behaviour inevitable for them. ... They were thus parts in existential dependence upon the whole world-organism. And they reacted upon one another not so much by mechanical impulsion or causation as by a kind of mysterious resonance."

===Huainanzi===
[[Liu An]]'s (c. 139 BCE) ''[[Huainanzi]]'' "Masters of Huainan" is second only to the writings of [[Dong Zhongshu]] (see ''Chunqiu fanlu'' below) as a source for sympathetic-resonance theory in the Han period (Sharf 2002: 85). According to Charles Le Blanc (1985: 9), the ''Huainanzi'' significantly advanced Chinese cosmological theory, largely due to the use of resonance as a catalyst that blended together ideas from the [[School of Naturalists|School of Yin-Yang]] (such as ''ganying'') with ideas from [[Daoism]] (such as ''[[Wu wei|wuwei]]'').

While all 21 chapters in the ''Huainanzi'' incorporate aspects of cosmological resonance, and chapter 6 ''Lanming'' 覽冥, translated as "Peering into the Obscure" or "Surveying Obscurities", is entirely focused on elaborating resonance, the word ''ganying'' does not appear once in the text. This ''Huainanzi'' uses ''ying'' 應 151 times, frequently to denote ''ganying'', and uses ''gan'' 感 39 times. The ''Huainanzi'' translators John S. Major et al. (2010: 210) explain that ''gan'' means "an influence; to influence; a stimulus; to stimulate; to evoke a response" and appears twice in chapter 6; and ''ying'' means "to respond; a response" and appears 7 times. The words ''gan'' and ''ying'' only [[co-occurrence|co-occur]] a few times, but these instances conform exactly to the meaning of resonance that one expects from the concept of ''ganying''; for example, "when stimulated they respond" (''gan er ying'' 感而應, 7.7), and "the stimulus impels a response externally" (''gan dong ying yu wai'' 感動應於外, 10.27). These scholars (Major et al. 2010: 210) conclude that when the ''Huainanzi'' was written in the mid-2nd century BCE, ''ganying'' "resonance" itself had not yet stabilized as a technical term for the phenomenon. ''Huainanzi'' chapter 12 ''Daoying'' 道應 "Responses of the Way" explains (Major et al. 2010:430), "the ruler must choose the appropriate response (''ying'') grounded in the Way that is evoked (''gan'') by the circumstances of the moment".

''Huainanzi'' translators proposed two hypotheses for the origins of ''ganying'' philosophy. Charles Le Blanc (1985: 143) asserts that the idea originated from musical resonance. John S. Major believes the ideas of [[Zou Yan]] (305-240 BCE), founder of the School of Yin-Yang, had a pervading influence on the ''Huainanzi'', and suggests that the doctrine of ''qi'' and ''ganying'' resonance could perhaps be regarded as a genuine creation of the Zuo Yan school.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The question is, how do these effects come about in the absence of mathematical or mechanical links among the things in a single category? The answer, supplied by Tsou Yen and his school, is that things in a category "vibrate" resonantly together, as two identically-tuned lute strings will vibrate together, and do so through the medium of ''ch'i'', an invisible, aethereal, vibrant substance that permeates the universe. (Major 1993: 34) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Huainanzi'' has two versions of the earlier ''Zhuangzi'' zither string resonance analogy. Both Chapter 6 and Chapter 11 omit the reference to Lu Ju and his disciple who attracted ''yang'' to light a fire and ''yin'' to make ice, and each account adds a different interpretation. The shorter version refers to the [[Tao|Dao]]'s mysterious ineffability.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, one who makes [something] true uses the level; one who makes something straight uses the marking cord. Making true or straight without being in the line or on the level is an art that cannot be shared. When one strikes the [note] ''gong'', ''gong'' responds [應]; pluck the ''jue'' [string], and [another] ''jue'' [string] moves [動]. This is the mutual response of identical tones [同音之相應]. What does not correspond to any of the five tones, but to which all twenty-five strings respond [應], is the Way, which cannot be transmitted. Thus, solitude is the lord of form [形之君]; silence is the ruler of tone [音之主]. (11.14, tr. Major et al. 2010: 417) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The longer version adds a mystical "Great Penetration" associated with a Daoist ''[[Zhenren]]'' "True/Perfected Person".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now when a person who tunes a ''se'' plays [the note] ''gong'', [another] ''gong'' [string] responds [應]; when he plucks a ''jue'' [string], [another] ''jue'' responds [動]. This is the harmony of notes that are the same. But if [he] tunes one string eccentrically, so that it does not accord with [any] of the five notes and then strikes it, and all twenty-five strings [of the ''se''] respond [應], this is [a case of] the sounds not yet having begun to differentiate but the ruler of [all] notes having already achieved its form [音之君已形]. Thus one who penetrates to Supreme Harmony [太和] is as confused as [a person who] is stupified by drink, who wanders about in a sweet daze without knowing where he has come from or where he is going. Simple and mild, he [descends] the vortex; simple and stupified, he [reaches] his end. He is like one who has not yet begun to emerge from the Ancestor. This is called the Great Penetration [大通]. (6.4, tr. Major et al 2010: 220) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Like the indiscernible "sounds not yet having begun to differentiate", the True Person "who has not yet begun to emerge" resounds harmoniously with all things. According to Le Blanc (1985: 97, 140), this story's meaning revolves around a distinction between "relative resonance" when notes of the same pitch, such as the strings of two zithers tuned to the ''gong'' note, cause each other to vibrate in unison, and "total resonance" when an untuned note causes all 25 strings of a zither to resound simultaneously. The phenomenon of relative resonance, which is based on Yin-Yang theory, is experimentally verifiable; but the hypothesis (or "super-experiment") of total resonance is not verifiable, and used as a simile pointing to a realm beyond Yin-Yang. Total resonance differs in kind, not in degree, from relative resonance. "There is a difference of level. The author starts from a solid but meaningful empirical fact that displays resonance and, from there, analogizes to a metaphorical or metaphysical level where resonance is all-encompassing" (Le Blanc 1985: 142).

To illustrate how categorically identical things mutually resonate and influence each other, the ''Huainanzi'' (3.2 and 6.2) uses "[[Chinese sun and moon mirrors|sun and moon mirrors]]" to exemplify things belonging to the yang and yin categories. The ''yángsuì'' 陽燧 "[[burning-mirror]] (which concentrates sunlight to ignite tinder)" is yang, round, and sun-like; the ''fāngzhū'' 方諸 "moon-mirror (used to collect dew by condensation)" is yin, square, and moon-like.
&lt;blockquote&gt;That things in their [various] categories [類] are mutually responsive [相應] is [something] dark, mysterious, deep, and subtle. Knowledge is not capable of assessing it; argument is not capable of explaining it. Thus, when the east wind arrives, wine turns clear and overflows [its vessels]; when silkworms secrete fragmented silk, the ''shang'' string [of a stringed instrument] snaps. Something has stimulated [感] them. When a picture is traced out with the ashes of reeds, the moon's halo has a [corresponding] gap. When the leviathan dies, comets appear. Something has moved them. Thus, when a sage occupies the throne, he embraces the Way and does not speak, and his nurturance reaches to the myriad people. But when ruler and ministers [harbor] distrust in their hearts, back-to-back arcs appear in the sky. The mutual responses [相應] of spirit ''qi'' [神氣] are subtle indeed! Thus, mountain clouds are like grassy hummocks; river clouds are like fish scales; dryland clouds are like smoky fire; cataract clouds are like billowing water. All resemble their forms and evoke responses [感] according to their class. The burning mirror takes fire from the sun; the square receptacle takes dew from the moon. Of [all the things] between Heaven and Earth, even a skilled astrologer cannot master all their techniques. [Even] a hand [that can hold] minutely tiny and indistinct things cannot grasp a beam of light. However, from what is within the palm of one's hand, one can trace [correlative] categories [類] to beyond the extreme end point [of the cosmos]. [Thus] that one can set up [these implements] and produce water and fire is [a function of] the mutually [responsive] movement [相動] of yin and yang of the same ''qi''. (6.2, tr. Major et al. 2010:216-217) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another Chapter 6 passage illustrates how resonance is in harmony with the Dao, and admits that even someone with "enlightened understanding" cannot explain the mysterious forces of [[magnetism]], [[optics]], [[enzymes]], and [[heliotropism]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now if one were to accept [that] fire can burn wood and use it to melt metal, that would [follow] the movement of the Way. But if one were to accept [that] lodestone can attract iron and use it to attract tile, that would certainly be difficult. Things certainly cannot be assessed according to their weight [alone]. Now, the burning mirror can draw fire [from the sun]; lodestone can draw iron; crabs spoil lacquer; and sunflowers incline to the sun – [but] even if one has enlightened understanding, it is not possible to [explain why] these things are so. Thus investigations by ear and eye are not adequate to discern the principles of things; discussions employing the mind and its conceptions are not adequate to distinguish true and false. Thus he who uses knowledge as the basis for government will have a hard time holding on to his state. Only he who penetrates to Supreme Harmony [太和] and who grasps the responses of the natural will be able to possess it [i.e., his state]. (6.3, tr. Major et al. 2010:219) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The obscure relation between crabs and [[lacquer]] refers to the Chinese medical treatment of [[urushiol-induced contact dermatitis]] with crushed shellfish, which supposedly prevents lacquer from drying properly. In Daoist cosmology, ''Taihe'' 太和 "Great/Supreme Harmony" is the beginning state before ''[[Hundun]]'' "primordial [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]".

Chapter six contrasts two pairs of mythological charioteers (the minimum crew of a [[Chariot (China)|Chinese chariot]] included a driver and an archer). Although Wang Liang 王良 and [[Zaofu]] 造父 were famously skillful equestrians, Qian Qie 鉗且 and Da Bing 大丙 controlled their horses through mutual resonance – a simile for how a sage ruler should be attuned to his people (Le Blanc 1985: 36). 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In ancient times, when Wang Liang and Zaofu went driving, [as soon as] they mounted their chariots and took hold of the reins, the horses set themselves in order and wanted to work together. They obediently paced in step with one another; [whether] pulling hard or easing off, they were as one. Their hearts were in tune and their ''qi'' harmonious; their bodies [became] more and more light and coordinated. They were content to work hard and happy to go forward; they galloped away as if they would vanish. They went right and left like [the waving of] a whip; they circled around like a jade bracelet. All people of that era considered [Wang Liang and Zaofu] to be superlative [charioteers], but that was because they had not yet seen any [truly] worthy ones. Now consider the charioteering of Qian Qie and Da Bing. They considered reins and bits superfluous, got rid of whips and cast aside goads. Before the chariot began to move, it was starting on its own. Before the horses were given the signal, they were walking on their own. They paced [like the] sun and moved [like the] moon. They flashed [like the] stars and advanced [like the] dark. They raced [like] lightning and leaped [like] ghosts. Advancing or withdrawing, gathering strength or stretching out, they did not see the slightest barrier. Thus, with no gesturing or pointing, with no cursing or scolding, they overtook the wild geese flying to Piled Stone Mountain, passed the jungle fowl [flying to] Guyu Mountain. Their galloping was like flying; their bursts of speed like thread snapping. [It was] like riding an arrow or mounting the wind, like following a cyclone and returning in an instant. At dawn they started from Fusang and set with the sun at Luotang. This was taking something unused and obtaining its usefulness: it was not done by examining things through reason or thought or through the exercise of manual skill. Whenever urgent desires took form in the breasts [of Qian Qie and Da Bing], their quintessential spirits were [already] communicated to the six horses. This was a case of using non-driving to go driving. (6.6, tr. Major et al. 2010: 222-223) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Huainanzi'' developed the idea of politically-oriented ''ganying'' philosophy. The most perfect form of government is that of ''wuwei'' "non-action", for it operates through the ''[[ziran]]'' "natural" ''ganying'' "resonance" of all things. The perfect ruler is the ''zhenren'' True Person who, being one with Dao, is in a state of mutual resonance with all things (Le Blanc 1985: 192). "What I call non-action [means] ... the undertakings of government will succeed, but [you] personally will not be glorified. [Your] accomplishments will be established, but your reputation will not obtain. [Non-action] does not mean that a stimulus [感] will not produce a response [應] or that a push will not move [something]." (19.2, tr. Major et al. 2010: 770-771). The Daoist idea of ''wuwei'' is interpreted formally in the sense of ''ganying'', "non-interference means to respond spontaneously and harmoniously to stimulus" (Le Blanc 1985: 37).

In conclusion, ''Huainanzi'' scholars delineate the meaning of ''ganying''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Kan-ying'' may be defined, in the final analysis, as the power of things to affect and to be affected in such a way as to bring about harmony. This power is based on the persistent affinity and attraction of things that were originally one, but that became scattered when the world began. Through the True Man ''kan-ying'' recreates the original unity. As a dynamic pattern ''kan-ying'' expresses the full cycle of cosmological, social and psychological integration. Its natural and universal character makes it binding for the cosmos as a whole and also for each and every one of the Ten Thousand Things issuing from Tao. In Chapter Six the foregoing pattern is applied mainly to the realm of human society and, more specifically, to the relations between the perfect ruler – the True Man - and the people. The argument there propounded, that these relations should be based on non-action (''wu-wei'') understood as resonance (''kan-ying''), draws its ultimate strength from the cosmological scheme outlined above. We may thus conclude that ''kan-ying'' not only forms a logically coherent and philosophically meaningful idea but also provides the focal point around which the ''Huai-nan Tzu'' cosmology is structured. (Le Blanc 1985: 209) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Resonance" is a central operative principle of the cosmos as conceived by the ''Huainanzi''. The phrase itself means "stimulus" (''gan'' 感) and "response" (''ying'' 應), which is how we have translated it when the ''Huainanzi'' refers specifically to the discrete component processes that the term denotes. Fundamentally, "resonance" is a process of dynamic interaction that transcends the limits of time, space, and ordinary linear causality. Through the mechanism of resonance, an event in one location (the "stimulus") produces simultaneous effects in another location (the "response"), even though the two phenomena have no direct spatial or mechanical contact. They may indeed be separated by vast gulfs of space. For example, connections between celestial events (eclipses, planetary motions) and events in the human community were understood as examples of "resonance." For the authors of the ''Huainanzi'', such connections were not coincidence or mere correspondence but dynamic influences exchanged through the energetic medium of ''qi''. All phenomena are both composed of and impelled by ''qi'', and since all currently differentiated ''qi'' emerged from an originally undifferentiated Grand One, all ''qi'' remains mutually resonantly linked. The pathways of resonance are not random, however. Objects are most sensitive to resonant influences emanating from other objects that share the same constituent form of ''qi''. (Major et al. 2010: 875) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Lunheng===
[[Wang Chong]]'s (c. 80 CE) ''[[Lunheng]]'' "Discourse Balance" uses ''ganying'' once to criticize prognostications from the ''Fengjia'' 風家 "School of Wind".
&lt;blockquote&gt;In regard to the Six Passions [六情: cheerfulness, anger, grief, joy, love, and hatred] the expositors of the wind theory maintain that, when the wind blows, robbers and thieves set to work under its influence [感應], but the nature of robbers and thieves cannot move Heaven to send the wind. When the wind blows, it has a strange influence on perverted minds so, that robbers and thieves do their deeds. How can we prove that? Robbers and thieves seeing something, take it away, and beholding an enemy, kill him. This is an off-hand business, and the work of a moment, and not premeditated day and night. When the heavenly afflatus passes, the time of greedy scoundrels and stealthy thieves has come. (43, tr. Forke 1907 1: 62)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wang Chong first used the word ''ganlei'' 感類 as a chapter title "Sympathetic Emotions" (tr. Forke), and later Chinese literature often used ''ganlei'' "sympathy between things of like kind" to describe sympathetic resonance among things of the same category (Sharf 2002: 85). 
&lt;blockquote&gt;When the ''Yin'' and the ''Yang'' are at variance, calamitous changes supervene. Either they arise from the unexpiated guilt of former generations, or it is the spontaneous action of the fluids. Worthies and sages feel an emotion by sympathy [感類], and, in their agitation, think out for themselves the reason for the calamity, implying some wickedness, having happened.  They incriminate themselves, and from fear that they themselves are culpable take every precaution. (55, tr. Forke 1907 2: 16) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Forke, "Sages have many affinities with Heaven which manifests itself by them. Therefore Heaven being agitated, they are agitated too."

===Fengsu Tongyi===
[[Ying Shao]]'s (c. 195 CE) ''[[Fengsu Tongyi]]'' uses ''ganying'' twice. The first usage is in a narrative about [[Crown Prince Dan]] from the [[state of Yan]] (d. 226 BCE) and the future Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] when he was King of the [[state of Qin]]. After Dan escaped from being held hostage by Qin, he sent [[Jing Ke]] to assassinate the King, but Heaven miraculously used ''ganying'' to save him from death.&lt;ref&gt;正失, 燕太子丹為質於秦始皇執欲殺之言能致此瑞者可得生活丹有神靈天為感應於是建使歸國&lt;/ref&gt; The second quotes the ''[[Shujing]]'' "Canon of Shun" (tr. Legge), [[Emperor Shun]] appointed [[Kui (Chinese mythology)|Kui]] to be Minister of Music, and Kui said, "I smite the (sounding-) stone, I gently strike it, and the various animals lead on one another to dance"; and asks, "if the various animals resonated, (quoting the ''Yijing'') 'How much more must it be so with (the operations of) men! How much more also with the spiritual agency!'."&lt;ref&gt;聲音, 書曰擊石拊石百獸率舞 鳥獸且猶感應而況於人乎況於鬼神乎&lt;/ref&gt;

==Daoism==
Post-Han Daoism expanded the notion of ''ganying'' far beyond the basic ''Huainanzi'' (above) ideas that historical events result from mutual resonance between different parts of the universe, and that human beings are agents of mutual resonance who participate fully in the creative transformations of Dao (Le Blanc 1985: 110).

''Chongxuan'' 重玄 "Twofold Mystery" Daoism emphasized the phenomena of sympathetic resonance. The ''Daodejing'' commentary of Cheng Xuanying 成玄英 (fl. 631-650), an important Twofold Mystery author, differentiated between two kinds of response: ''tongying'' 通應 "universal response" and ''bieying'' 别應 "differential response". Universal response is that of heaven, which responds out of compassion to all without distinction; differential response, is geared to ''biekan'' 别感 "specific stimuli", such as when [[Laozi]] gave the ''Daodejing'' to [[Yinxi]] (Sharf 2002: 96) .

The (7th century) Buddhist-influenced text ''Daojiao yishu'' 道教義樞 "Pivotal Meaning of Daoist Teachings" has a section titled ''Ganying yi'' 感應義 "The Meaning of Stimulus Response", which depicts the sage as one who spontaneously and appropriately ''ganying'' responds to stimuli, and enumerates six categories of stimulus and six of response. The six categories of stimulus are grouped into three pairs: "principal" (正) and "proximate" (附), whether the stimulus is initiated by a self-aware mind or an insentient object, "universal" (普) and specific "preferential" (偏), and "manifest" (顯) and "hidden" (陰) stimuli. The six categories of response are: through "pneuma" (氣), specifically the "primal pneuma" ([[Yuán qì|元氣]]), a response through "forms" (形), response through "language" (文), "sages" (聖), "worthies" (賢), and "transmitted" response (袭). Furthermore, the ''Daojiao yishu'' distinguishes four categories of ''ganying'' according to whether the agent and recipient of the stimulus are sentient or insentient, for example, the bell sounding at the collapse of the bronze mountain is in the third category of an insentient object stimulating a response in an insentient object (Sharf 2002: 96-97).

==Buddhism==
Since Chinese philosophers and authors invoked the principle of ''ganying'' to explain topics such as seasonal and astronomical cycles, celestial portents, moral retribution, and political upheaval, it is to be expected that the principle would similarly influence the Chinese understanding of Buddhist cosmology, philosophy, and monastic practice (Sharf 2002: 97). As an example of how the Chinese notion of sympathetic resonance was both powerful enough and malleable enough to lend itself to a variety of Buddhist hermeneutical tasks, Sharf says [[Guifeng Zongmi]] employed it in his account of [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] patriarchal succession: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Bodhidharma came from the west only in order to transmit the mind dharma. Thus he himself said: "My dharma is transmitted from mind to mind and does not depend on words or letters." This mind is the pure and original awakening of all sentient beings. It is also known as buddha-nature or numinous awakening 靈覺 ... If you wish to see the Way of the Buddhas, you must awaken to this mind. Therefore, the generations of patriarchs in this lineage transmit only this. If there is a sympathetic resonance and reciprocal tallying [between master and disciple] 感應相契, then although a single flame may be transmitted to a hundred thousand lamps, there will be no difference between them. (2002: 131-132) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although the Chinese word ''ganying'' 感應 was not employed in translating any specific Sanskrit term, it frequently occurs in Chinese Buddhist discussions elucidating the workings of ritual invocation and "jiachi" 加持 "empowerment; assistance" ([[adhiṣṭhāna]]). ''Ganying'' is the principle underlying the interaction between practitioner and Buddha, the supplicant is said to ''gan'' "stimulate; affect" the Buddha, which elicits the Buddha's compassionate ''ying'' "response". For example, the expressions ''ganfo'' 感佛 "affect the Buddha" or ''gan rulai'' 感如來 "stimulate the [[tathagata]]" (Sharf 2002: 120). The Buddhist monk [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]]'s (179 CE) Chinese ''Banzhou sanmei jing'' 般舟三昧經  translation of the ''[[Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra]]'' uses the indigenous notion of ''ganying'' "sympathetic resonance" to explain the interaction between the practitioner or supplicant and the grace of buddha or bodhisattva being invoked (Sharf 2002: 119).

[[Huiyuan (Buddhist)|Huiyuan]] (332-416), the first patriarch of the [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land School of Buddhism]], used a legend about a bronze bell resonating at the collapse of a distant bronze mountain as an explanation of ''ganying'' for the scholar Yin Zhongkan 殷仲堪 (d. 399). The (early 5th century) ''[[Shishuo Xinyu]]'' "A New Account of the Tales of the World" says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yin Chung-k'an once asked the monk Hui-yuan, "What is the substance of the ''Book of Changes''?" Hui-yuan replied, "Stimulus-response [''gan'' 感] is the substance of the ''Changes''." Yin continued, "When the bronze mountain collapsed in the west and the magic bell responded [''ying'' 應] in the east, was ''that'' the ''Book of changes''?" Hui-yuan smiled without answering. (tr. Mather 1976:123&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The (5th century) ''[[Hou Hanshu]]'' biography of Fan Ying 樊英 (tr. Sharf 2006: 82) likewise records that during the reign of [[Emperor Shun of Han]] (r. 126-144 CE), there was a disaster at the [[Min Mountains]] in [[Shu (state)|Shu]] (modern [[Sichuan]]). "A bell below the emperor's hall sounded of itself. Fan Ying explained: 'Min Mountain in Shu (Szechwan) has collapsed. Mountains are mothers in relation to bronze. When the mother collapses, the child cries. In due time Shu reported that indeed a mountain had collapsed, and the time of the collapse matched precisely the time the bell had sounded." Sharf explains ''ganying'' resonance as the mechanism through which categorically related but spatially distant phenomena interact, as a mode of seemingly spontaneous response (although not in the sense of "uncaused") natural in a holistic universe of pattern and interdependent order.

[[Sengyou]]'s ''Chu sanzang jiji'' 出三藏記集 preserves a statement by [[Zhi Dun]] (314-366).
&lt;blockquote&gt;The principle is different from [the world of] change, and change is different from principle. The teachings are different from the essence [of wisdom, the inner mind of the sage], and the essence is different from the teachings. Therefore, the thousand changes and myriad transformations all take place outside the [realm of] principle, for how could there be any movement in the spirit [of the sage]? Precisely because it does not move, it can endlessly respond to change. The endless change does not denote the presence of the sage in things, nor is the change of things itself the sage. The myriad sounds cause the bell to reverberate—a reverberation that, although single, encompasses [all the myriad sounds]. A myriad things stimulate 感 the sage, and the sage also responds 應 out of stillness. Therefore, the [myriad] sounds are not the same as the [single] reverberation, and the words [of the teachings] are not the same as the wisdom of the sage. (tr. Sharf 2002: 112-113) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Scholars in the ''Chengshi zong'' 成實宗 or [[Tattvasiddhi]] School were engaged in a controversy over the nature of stimulus-response. For example, the ''Dasheng Xuanlun'' 大乘玄論 "Treatise on the Mystery of the Mahāyāna" by Zhizang 智藏 (458-522) explains ''ganying'',
&lt;blockquote&gt;Stimulus-response is the great tenet of the buddha-dharma, the essential teaching of the many sutras. To "stimulate" means to bring or summon forth, and to "respond" means to go forth and meet in welcome. As all sentient beings possess [the seeds of] goodness, they may induce the Buddhas to descend and take shape in front of them, and [the Buddhas] will meet them in welcome. The principle [is such that they] neither deviate nor overshoot [the mark]. This is called stimulus and response. The common person stimulates but does not respond; the Buddhas respond but do not stimulate; and bodhisattvas both respond and stimulate. (tr. Sharf 2002: 121-122) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Buddhist scholars in the [[Tiantai]] School further developed the doctrine of ''ganying''. [[Zhiyi]] (538–597) analyzed the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' in terms of thirty ''miao'' 妙 "wonders", coming from the sutra's Chinese title of ''Miaofa lieahua jing'' 妙法蓮花經 "Scripture of the Lotus Blossom of the Wondrous Dharma", including the ''ganying miao'' 感應妙 "wonder of stimulus-response" (Sharf 2002: 124). 

According to the Mahayana Buddhist doctrine of [[Trikāya]] (translated as ''sanshen'' 三身) "three bodies", a single Buddha has three coexisting buddha-bodies: the ''[[dharmakāya]]'' (''fashen'' 法身) "truth body" that is identical with transcendent reality and realization of true enlightenment, ''[[sambhogakāya]]'' (''baoshen'' 報身) "delight/reward body" for the enjoyment of the merits attained as a bodhisattva, and ''nirmāṇakāya'' (''yingshen'' 應身) "response body" manifested in response to the need to save all sentient beings. In addition to Chinese ''yingshen'' 應身 "response body; resonant body", some schools translate Sanskrit ''nirmāṇakāya'' as ''huashen'' 化身 "transformation body" or ''huayingshen'' 化應身 "transformation response body".

Different Chinese Buddhist schools and texts give sometimes conflicting interpretations of ''yingshen'' and ''huashen''. The [[Northern Wei]] (386-534) dynasty ''She dasheng lun'' 攝大乘論 translation of the ''[[Mahāyāna-samgraha]]'' directly uses ''yingshen'' to translate ''nirmāṇakāya'' (Sharf 2002: 103). The ''Jinguang mingjing'' 金光明經 ''[[Golden Light Sutra]]'' (''Suvarṇaprabhāsa Sūtra'') distinguishes the ''huashen'' "transformation body" (''nirmāṇakāya'') that can be seen by all beings in whatever form best suits their needs from the ''yingshen'' "resonant body" (functionally the ''saṃbhogakāya''), possessing the [[Physical characteristics of the Buddha#The 32 Signs of a Great Man |32 major signs]] and [[Physical characteristics of the Buddha#The 80 secondary characteristics|80 minor marks]] of a Buddha, that is only manifest to buddhas and bodhisattvas (Sharf 2002: 104-105). The ''Dasheng qixin lun'' 大乘起信論 or ''[[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]]'' makes no distinction between the two, with the ''yingshen'' "response body" being the Buddha of the 32 signs who revealed himself to the earthly disciples.

Sharf (2002: 111-112) explains that the Chinese understanding of ''yingshen'' "resonant/response [buddha-]body" incorporates the Buddhist notion of ''nirmāṇakāya'' a corporeal (or seemingly corporeal) body manifest in response to the needs of suffering beings and the Chinese cosmological principles that explain the power to produce such bodies in terms of ''wuwei'' nonaction and ''ganying'' sympathetic resonance. "The sage, bodhisattva, or buddha, through the principle of nonaction, becomes at one with the universe, acquires the attributes of stillness and harmonious balance, and, without any premeditation or will of his own, spontaneously responds to the stimuli of the world around him, manifesting bodies wherever and whenever the need arises."

Paralleling the use of ''ganying'' 感應 in Chinese Buddhism, [[Japanese Buddhism]] borrowed the [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] loanword ''kannō'' 感應. For example, [[Kannō-ji]] is a [[Buddhist]] temple on [[Mount Kabutoyama]] in [[Nishinomiya]], [[Hyōgo Prefecture|Hyōgo]].

==Neo-Confucianism==
During the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1276), the cosmological writings of the [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucianists]], escpecially the [[Cheng-Zhu school]], gave ''ganying'' its "perfect expression" (Le Blanc 1985: 9).

The British sinologist [[Angus Charles Graham]] says the Chinese "correlative cosmology" concepts of ''gan'' and ''ying'' occupy the same place in Song philosophy as causation in the West.
&lt;blockquote&gt;If it is assumed that things consist of inert matter, it is natural to think in terms of "effect" which passively allow themselves to be pushed by "causes". But if inert matter is only the essentially active ether ''ch'i'' in an impure state, this kind of action will only be of minor importance; in the purer ether, when A acts on B, B will not only be moved by it, but will respond actively. (1958: 38) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Noting that Chinese ''ganying'' has no exact English equivalent, the Philippine scholar in Chinese philosophy [[Antonio Cua]] (1975: 2) translates it as "influence and response" or "responding to influence", and proposes a Neo-Confucian conception of the world in which natural events or states of affairs are viewed as an open set of influences that call for some sort of human responses or actions. This conception of a practical rather than a theoretical causation is a model or "an imaginative schema for guiding actions toward the Confucian vision of central harmony".

The ''Jishanji'' 霽山集 "Clear Mountain Collection" by the Song author Lin Jingxi 林景熙 (1242-1310) praised psychological resonance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Scholars of old time said that the mind is originally empty, and only because of this can it respond to natural things [''yingwu'' 應物] without prejudices (lit. traces, [''ji'' 迹]) left behind to influence later vision). Only the empty mind [''xuxin'' 虚心] can respond to the things of Nature. Though everything resonates with the mind, the mind should be as if it had never resonated, and things should not remain in it. But once the mind has received (impressions of) natural things, they tend to remain and not to disappear, thus leaving traces in the mind. (These affect later seeing and thinking, so that the mind is not truly 'empty' and unbiased.) It should be like a river gorge with swans flying overhead; the river has no desire to retain the swan, yet the swan's passage is traced out by its shadow without any omission. (tr. Needham 1956: 89) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Chinese folk religion==
Not only was the notion of ''ganying'' resonance situated in the cultural domains of Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism, but also in [[Chinese folk religion]], with a meaning of "[[divine retribution]]; moral retribution". The related term ''[[Bao ying|baoying]]'' 报應 "moral retribution" originated from Buddhist doctrines of karma and reincarnation, and became a fundamental principle of Chinese popular religious belief and practice.

''Ganying'' "moral retribution" was central to the genre of popular religious texts known as ''shànshū'' 善書 (lit. "good book") "moral-instruction book; moral tract". It specifically referred to the principle of "tit-for-tat moral retribution", based upon the belief that one's good and evil deeds will result in corresponding rewards and punishments, typically manifest as the lengthening or shortening of one's life (Sharf 2002: 93-94).

The (c. 12th century) anonymous Song dynasty compilation ''[[Treatise On the Response of the Tao|Taishang ganying pian]]'' 太上感應篇 "Folios of the Most High on Retribution" was the classic in the ''shanshu'' genre, and one of the most widely circulated Daoist works in late imperial China (Sharf 2002: 95). "The Impious Magistrate" story exemplifies ''Taishang ganying pian'' content.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Wang An-shih, a high magistrate of the Sung dynasty (960-1278 A.D.), was a learned scholar but recklessly irreverent, and so introduced, radical innovations in his administration. People complained, officers demurred, and the emperor expressed surprise; but he would say, "Heavenly omens should not be heeded, human discontent need not be minded, and there is no sense in following the ancestral laws." He and his son, who assisted him in his office, even attempted to revive the ancient cruel custom of corporal punishment; but before the law was passed, the son died, and Wang An-shih built a Buddhist temple on the site of his son's residence. While the magistrate was performing the customary Buddhist rite, he thought he faintly perceived in the flame of a burning candle the image of his son, bound hand and foot in a cangue, crying: "Our attempt to revive corporal mutilation angered Heaven, and I have no chance of getting out of this infernal torture." Later An-shih fell in disgrace; he lost his position and died miserably in exile. Now it happened that soon afterwards, one of An-shih's relatives was taken ill, and swooned, and when he recovered, he said that he had been ushered into a special department in hell, where hung the sign: "Wickedness and Crime Eternally Prohibited," and there lie saw a noble-looking man in a cangue, who had gray hair and large eyes. Though he did not mention the name of this unfortunate person, everyone around knew that it was Wang An-shih of whom he spoke. When An-shih's daughter inquired what could be done, the sick man simply said: "All that is necessary is to accumulate merits and nothing more." (tr. Suzuki and Carus 1906: 96-97) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Chinese [[cangue]] was a portable pillory used for torture and corporal punishment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4221">'''Georg Misch''' ({{IPA-de|mɪʃ|lang}}; 5 April 1878, [[Berlin]] – 10 June 1965, [[Göttingen]]) was a German [[philosopher]].

==Life==
Of [[Jewish]] descent,&lt;ref&gt;Stratis Papaioannou, "Byzantium and the Modernist Subject: The Case of Autobiographical Literature" in Roland Betancourt (ed.), ''Byzantium/Modernism: The Byzantine as Method in Modernity'', BRILL (2015), p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; Misch was the pupil and son-in-law of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]. Misch attempted to further develop Dilthey's life-philosophical [[hermeneutics]], in particular in relation to the study of [[logic]], comparative philosophy and [[autobiography]]. Misch edited  a number of volumes of Dilthey's works.
Misch concluded his studies with Dilthey in Berlin in 1900 with a dissertation on ''Die philosophische Begründung des Positivismus in den Schriften von D’Alembert und Turgot''. He worked as a [[professor]] in [[Marburg]] and [[Göttingen]] before retiring under pressure from the National Socialist government in 1935. He went into exile to the [[United Kingdom|UK]], living there from 1939 until 1946. Misch returned to Göttingen in 1946 and continued to work there until his death in 1965.

His students include [[Otto Friedrich Bollnow]] and [[Josef König]].

==Work==
Georg Misch wrote one of the first extended critical appropriations of [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], which evaluated [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] from the perspective of Dilthey's philosophy, in ''Lebensphilosophie und Phänomenologie. Eine Auseinandersetzung der Diltheyschen Richtung mit Heidegger und Husserl'', Leipzig 1930 (3. Aufl. Stuttgart 1964). Misch's ''Der Weg in die Philosophie'' (1926) is  a pioneering work in comparative philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;See Nelson, Eric S. "Heidegger, Misch, and the Origins of Philosophy." ''Journal of Chinese Philosophy'' 39.S1 (2012): 10-30.&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a hermeneutic logic that was later published as ''Der Aufbau der Logik auf dem Boden der Philosophie des Lebens''.&lt;ref&gt;See Grondin, Jean. "Georg Misch und die Universalität der Hermeneutik: Logik oder Rhetorik? ''Dilthey-Jahrbuch'' 11 (1997-1998), 48-63.&lt;/ref&gt; He is mostly known for his monumental ''Geschichte der Autobiographie'' (''History of Autobiography''), in several volumes, beginning in 1907. The last volume was published posthumously in 1969.

==Selected works==

[[File:Gertrude C. Bussey (1936).jpg|thumb|Gertrude Bussey (1936) from group photo]]

== Education and academic career ==
Gertrude Bussey first attended [[Barnard College]] before graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;in 1908 from [[Wellesley College]]. After graduate study at [[Columbia University]] in 1908-1909 and teaching at a private school in [[Bronxville]] she went on to do further study at [[Oxford University]] during 1912-14. She then went to [[Northwestern University]] and became, in 1915, its first student to receive a [[PhD]] in philosophy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.northwestern.edu/community/wiphi.html|title=Northwestern Department of Philosophy WiPhi (Women in Philosophy) homepage|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Dr. Bussey was appointed as an instructor of philosophy at [[Goucher College]]. She was promoted to full professor in 1921, and became chair of the philosophy department in 1924, a position she held until her retirement in 1953. In 1954 she received an honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] (LHD) from the college.

In 1912 the [[Open Court Publishing Company]] produced a French/English version of ''[[Man a Machine]]'' by [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] that was founded on Bussey's translation (revised by [[Mary Whiton Calkins]] with the help of M. Carret and [[George Santayana]]) and included historical and philosophical notes that were condensed and adapted from a thesis on La Mettrie presented by Bussey to Wellesley College.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/typicalrecentco00bussgoog|title=Man a Machine, by Julien Offroy de la Mende|last=Bussey|first=Gertrude|publisher=Open Court Publishing Co.|year=1912|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=Front matter}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reprinted in 1927 and 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La Mettrie: Machine Man and Other Writings|last=Offray de La Mettrie|first=Julien|last2=Edited by Ann Thomson|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|isbn=9780521478496|location=|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the only available English translation of La Mettrie made since 1750&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CIdjnUfmb9cC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=was+originally+made+by+Gertrude+C.+Bussey,+but+the+preface+says&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4zFDHG3SYT&amp;sig=LbN5go00-1McxLrI495lOvhYFPM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiunseemerYAhUCCsAKHYQZBt8Q6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=was%20originally%20made%20by%20Gertrude%20C.%20Bussey%2C%20but%20the%20preface%20says&amp;f=false|title=Native Informant: Essays on Film, Fiction, and Popular Culture|last=Braudy|first=Leo|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1991|isbn=0195052749|location=New York|pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; and no newer English translation was made available until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verbeek|first=Theo|date=June 1996|title=Reviewed Work: Man a Machine and Man a Plant by Julien Offray de La Mettrie, Richard A.

Bussey's later articles were concerned with religion.

== Activism ==
Dr Bussey "demonstrated throughout her life a concern for economic and social justice, peace, and above all, freedom"&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Notable Maryland Women|last=Helmes|first=Winifred Gertrude|publisher=Tidewater Publishers|year=1977|isbn=9780870332364|location=Maryland|pages=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was involved with numerous progressive social and political causes. She was, along with [[Elisabeth Gilman]], a co-founder and leader of the Maryland Civil Liberties Committee, which was formed in 1921 in the wake of arrests and deportations of immigrant workers and was later to become a branch of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aclu-md.org/Index%20content/ACLUMD_Highlights.pdf|title=ACLU of Maryland. "Highlights of 75 Years of Fighting for Rights in the Free State,"|last=|first=|date=|website=Wayback Machine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004225357/http://www.aclu-md.org/Index%20content/ACLUMD_Highlights.pdf|archive-date=4 October 2011|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also involved with the Baltimore Open Forum, the Consumers' League of Maryland, the Baltimore [[YMCA]], and the Church League for Industrial Democracy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Bussey was however "most completely identified with the [[Women's International League for Peace and Freedom]]"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; (WILPF). She was an original member of WILPF's Baltimore branch and was to serve as its Chairperson. On behalf of WILPF she traveled the Midwest giving lectures about the link between education and war and peace.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At a 1935 lecture in [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]], [[Maryland]], Bussey declared "We must strive to solve the economic and political problems which drive modern countries into war," and that "the world is now engaged in a race between education and death," clarifying, as [[Mitchell K. Hall|Mitchel K. Hal]], put it "that the solution to war was education and that permanent peace could only be achieved when people had the proper knowledge to see alternatives to war".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
[[File:EditedWLPF1936.jpg|thumb|440x440px|Gertrude Bussey (front row, second from right) with fellow WILPF delegates on 30 September 30, 1936 after meeting with President Roosevelt. [Original here: https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/hec2013003924/&lt;nowiki&gt; ]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]
On the 30th of September 1936 Bussey was a member of a WILPF delegation that discussed peace issues with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] at the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/hec2013003924/|title=Peace issues discussed with president, Washington, D.C. Sept. 30.|last=Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division Washington|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bussey served as National President of WILPF from May 1939 but, uncertain she could maintain the pacifist stance she felt the position required she resigned the leadership in May 1941. She did however remain active within WILPF and went on to serve as Honorary National President from 1960 to 1961.

Bussey died before she could complete her projected 50-year history on the WILPF, it was however completed by Margaret Tims and published posthumously as ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, 1915-1965: A Record of Fifty Years Work''' (1965).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1980 the monograph was reissued by Aiden Press with the title ''Pioneers for Peace: Women's International League for Peace and Freedom 1915-1965''. In a review prompted by this reissue Francis Early described it as "an important, indeed a crucial book, for anyone interested in the history of the women's peace movement". Early claimed that its authors represented "the best of the tradition of activist-scholars" and had produced a study that "is carefully researched, well written, and imbued with insights gained from first-hand knowledge of events and people"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Early|first=Francis|date=1987|title=Pioneers for Peace: Women's International League for Peace and Freedom 1915-1965|url=http://journals.msvu.ca/index.php/atlantis/article/view/4393/3633|journal=Atlantis: Critical Studies in Gender, Culture &amp; Social Justice|volume=22| issue = 1|pages=118–120|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.''

== Legacy ==
After Dr. Bussey's death on March 13, 1961, which was marked by an obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1961/03/14/archives/gertrude-c-bussey-dies-at-73-pacifist-was-goucher-professor.html|title=Gertrude C.

'''Giordano Bruno''' ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|ɔr|ˈ|d|ɑː|n|oʊ|_|ˈ|b|r|uː|n|oʊ}}; {{IPA-it|dʒorˈdaːno ˈbruːno|lang}}; {{lang-la|Iordanus Brunus Nolanus}}; born '''Filippo Bruno''', 1548 – 17 February 1600) was an Italian [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]], philosopher, mathematician, poet, and cosmological theorist.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno was a mathematician and philosopher, but is not considered an astronomer by the modern astronomical community, as there is no record of him carrying out physical observations, as was the case with Brahe, Kepler, and Galileo. Pogge, Richard W. http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Essays/Bruno.html 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his cosmological theories, which conceptually extended the then-novel [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]]. He proposed that the stars were distant suns surrounded by their own [[exoplanets|planets]], and he raised the possibility that these planets might foster life of their own, a philosophical position known as [[cosmic pluralism]]. He also insisted that the universe is [[infinity|infinite]] and could have no "center".

Starting in 1593, Bruno was tried for [[Christian heresy|heresy]] by the [[Roman Inquisition]] on charges of denial of several core Catholic doctrines, including [[Hell|eternal damnation]], the [[Trinity]], the [[Christology|divinity of Christ]], the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|virginity of Mary]], and [[transubstantiation]]. Bruno's [[pantheism]] was also a matter of grave concern,&lt;ref&gt;Birx, Jams H.. [http://www.theharbinger.org/xvi/971111/birx.html "Giordano Bruno"] The Harbinger, Mobile, AL, 11 November 1997. "Bruno was burned to death at the stake for his pantheistic stance and cosmic perspective."&lt;/ref&gt; as was his teaching of the [[Metempsychosis|transmigration of the soul]]. The Inquisition found him guilty, and he was [[Execution by burning|burned at the stake]] in Rome's [[Campo de' Fiori]] in 1600. After his death, he gained considerable fame, being particularly celebrated by 19th- and early 20th-century commentators who regarded him as [[conflict thesis|a martyr for science]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Giordano Bruno: Martyrs of free thought no. 1|author=Arturo Labriola}}&lt;/ref&gt; although historians have debated the extent to which his heresy trial was a response to his astronomical views or to other aspects of his philosophy and theology.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1964, p. 450&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Crowe, ''The Extraterrestrial Life Debate 1750–1900'', Cambridge University Press, 1986, p. 10, "[Bruno's] sources... seem to have been more numerous than his followers, at least until the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century revival of interest in Bruno as a supposed 'martyr for science.' It is true that he was burned at the stake in Rome in 1600, but the church authorities guilty of this action were almost certainly more distressed at his denial of Christ's divinity and alleged diabolism than at his cosmological doctrines."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Frank, ''The Constant Fire: Beyond the Science vs. Religion Debate'', University of California Press, 2009, p. 24, "Though Bruno may have been a brilliant thinker whose work stands as a bridge between ancient and modern thought, his persecution cannot be seen solely in light of the war between science and religion."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;White, Michael. ''The Pope and the Heretic: The True Story of Giordano Bruno, the Man who Dared to Defy the Roman Inquisition,'' p. 7. Perennial, New York, 2002. "This was perhaps the most dangerous notion of all... If other worlds existed with intelligent beings living there, did they too have their visitations? The idea was quite unthinkable."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Bruno's case is still considered a landmark in the history of [[Freethought|free thought]] and the emerging sciences.&lt;ref name=gatti18&gt;{{cite book|last=Gatti|first=Hilary|title=Giordano Bruno and Renaissance Science: Broken Lives and Organizational Power|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, New York|pages=18–19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cYumhwTQP8C|accessdate=21 March 2014|quote=For Bruno was claiming for the philosopher a principle of free thought and inquiry which implied an entirely new concept of authority: that of the individual intellect in its serious and continuing pursuit of an autonomous inquiry… It is impossible to understand the issue involved and to evaluate justly the stand made by Bruno with his life without appreciating the question of free thought and liberty of expression. His insistence on placing this issue at the center of both his work and of his defense is why Bruno remains so much a figure of the modern world. If there is, as many have argued, an intrinsic link between science and liberty of inquiry, then Bruno was among those who guaranteed the future of the newly emerging sciences, as well as claiming in wider terms a general principle of free thought and expression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=montano1&gt;{{cite book|last=Montano|first=Aniello|title=Le deposizioni davanti al tribunale dell'Inquisizione|date=24 November 2007|publisher=La Città del Sole|location=Napoli|page=71|editor=Antonio Gargano|quote=In Rome, Bruno was imprisoned for seven years and subjected to a difficult trial that analyzed, minutely, all his philosophical ideas. Bruno, who in Venice had been willing to recant some theses, become increasingly resolute and declared on 21 December 1599 that he 'did not wish to repent of having too little to repent, and in fact did not know what to repent.' Declared an unrepentant heretic and excommunicated, he was burned alive in the Campo dei Fiori in Rome on Ash Wednesday, 17 February 1600. On the stake, along with Bruno, burned the hopes of many, including philosophers and scientists of good faith like Galileo, who thought they could reconcile religious faith and scientific research, while belonging to an ecclesiastical organization declaring itself to be the custodian of absolute truth and maintaining a cultural militancy requiring continual commitment and suspicion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=birx&gt;{{cite news|last=Birx|first=James|title=Giordano Bruno|url=http://www.theharbinger.org/xvi/971111/birx.html|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Mobile Alabama Harbinger|date=11 November 1997|quote=To me, Bruno is the supreme martyr for both free thought and critical inquiry… Bruno's critical writings, which pointed out the hypocrisy and bigotry within the Church, along with his tempestuous personality and undisciplined behavior, easily made him a victim of the religious and philosophical intolerance of the 16th century. Bruno was excommunicated by the Catholic, Lutheran and Calvinist Churches for his heretical beliefs. The Catholic hierarchy found him guilty of infidelity and many errors, as well as serious crimes of heresy… Bruno was burned to death at the stake for his pantheistic stance and cosmic perspective.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to cosmology, Bruno also wrote extensively on the [[art of memory]], a loosely organized group of [[mnemonic]] techniques and principles. Historian [[Frances Yates]] argues that Bruno was deeply influenced by [[Arab astrology]] (particularly the philosophy of [[Averroes]]&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Giordano-Bruno|title=Giordano Bruno|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Neoplatonism]], Renaissance [[Hermeticism]], and Genesis-like legends surrounding the Egyptian god [[Thoth]].&lt;ref&gt;The primary work on the relationship between Bruno and Hermeticism is Frances Yates, ''Giordano Bruno and The Hermetic Tradition'', 1964; for an alternative assessment, placing more emphasis on the Kabbalah, and less on Hermeticism, see Karen Silvia De Leon-Jones, ''Giordano Bruno and the Kabbalah'', Yale, 1997; for a return to emphasis on Bruno's role in the development of Science, and criticism of Yates' emphasis on magical and Hermetic themes, see Hillary Gatti, ''Giordano Bruno and Renaissance Science'', Cornell, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies of Bruno have focused on his qualitative approach to mathematics and his application of the spatial concepts of geometry to language.&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro G. Farinella and Carole Preston, "Giordano Bruno: Neoplatonism and the Wheel of Memory in the 'De Umbris Idearum'", in ''Renaissance Quarterly'', Vol. 55, No. 2, (Summer, 2002), pp. 596–624; Arielle Saiber, ''Giordano Bruno and the Geometry of Language'', Ashgate, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

===Early years, 1548–1576===
Born Filippo &lt;!-- please do not change to 'Giordano', which was the monastic name he took later --&gt; Bruno in [[Nola]] (in [[Campania]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]) in 1548, he was the son of Giovanni Bruno, a soldier, and Fraulissa Savolino. In his youth he was sent to [[Naples]] to be educated. He was tutored privately at the Augustinian monastery there, and attended public lectures at the [[Studium Generale]].&lt;ref&gt;Dorothea Waley Singer, ''Giordano Bruno, His Life and Thought'', New York, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 17, he entered the [[Dominican Order]] at the monastery of [[San Domenico Maggiore]] in [[Naples]], taking the name Giordano, after Giordano Crispo, his metaphysics tutor. He continued his studies there, completing his [[novitiate]], and became an ordained priest in 1572 at age 24. During his time in Naples he became known for his skill with the art of memory and on one occasion traveled to Rome to demonstrate his mnemonic system before [[Pope Pius V]] and [[Scipione Rebiba|Cardinal Rebiba]]. In his later years Bruno claimed that the Pope accepted his dedication to him of the lost work ''On The Ark of Noah'' at this time.&lt;ref&gt;This is recorded in the diary of one Guillaume Cotin, librarian of the Abbey of St. Victor, who recorded recollections of a number of personal conversations he had with Bruno. Bruno also mentions this dedication in the Dedicatory Epistle of ''The Cabala of Pegasus'' (''Cabala del Cavallo Pegaseo'', 1585).&lt;/ref&gt;

While Bruno was distinguished for outstanding ability, his taste for free thinking and forbidden books soon caused him difficulties. Given the controversy he caused in later life it is surprising that he was able to remain within the monastic system for eleven years. In his testimony to Venetian inquisitors during his trial, many years later, he says that proceedings were twice taken against him for having cast away images of the saints, retaining only a crucifix, and for having recommended controversial texts to a novice.&lt;ref&gt;Gargano (2007), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Such behavior could perhaps be overlooked, but Bruno's situation became much more serious when he was reported to have defended the [[Arianism|Arian heresy]], and when a copy of the banned writings of [[Erasmus]], annotated by him, was discovered hidden in the convent privy. When he learned that an indictment was being prepared against him in Naples he fled, shedding his [[religious habit]], at least for a time.&lt;ref&gt;Gosselin has argued that Bruno's report that he returned to Dominican garb in Padua suggests that he kept his tonsure at least until his arrival in Geneva in 1579. He also suggests it is likely that Bruno kept the tonsure even after this point, showing a continued and deep religious attachment contrary to the way in which Bruno has been portrayed as a martyr for modern science. Instead, Gosselin argues, Bruno should be understood in the context of reformist Catholic dissenters. Edward A. Gosselin, "A Dominican Head in Layman's Garb? A Correction to the Scientific Iconography of Giordano Bruno", in ''The Sixteenth Century Journal'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Autumn, 1996), pp. 673–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First years of wandering, 1576–1583===
Bruno first went to the Genoese port of [[Noli]], then to [[Savona]], [[Turin]] and finally to [[Venice]], where he published his lost work ''On the Signs of the Times'' with the permission (so he claimed at his trial) of the Dominican Remigio Nannini Fiorentino. From Venice he went to [[Padua]], where he met fellow Dominicans who convinced him to wear his [[religious habit]] again. From Padua he went to [[Bergamo]] and then across the Alps to [[Chambéry]] and [[Lyon]]. His movements after this time are obscure.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothea Waley Singer, ''Giordano Bruno, His Life and Thought'', New York, 1950 "Following the northern route back through Brescia, Bruno came to Bergamo where he resumed the monastic habit. He perhaps visited Milan, and then leaving Italy he crossed the Alps by the Mont Cenis pass, and came to Chambéry. He describes his hospitable reception there by the Dominican Convent, but again he received no encouragement to remain, and he journeyed on to Lyons. Bruno's next movements are obscure. In 1579 he reached Geneva."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Earlierbruno.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The earliest depiction of Bruno is an engraving published in 1715 in Germany, presumed based on a lost contemporary portrait.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Virgilio Salvestrini, ''Bibliografia di Giordano Bruno'', Firenze, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In 1579 he arrived in [[Geneva]]. As D.W. Singer, a Bruno biographer, notes, "The question has sometimes been raised as to whether Bruno became a Protestant, but it is intrinsically most unlikely that he accepted membership in Calvin's communion"&lt;ref&gt;Dorothea Waley Singer, ''Giordano Bruno, His Life and Thought'', New York, 1950; Singer points out in a footnote that Bruno's name appears in a list, compiled one hundred years later, of Italian refugees who had belonged to the Protestant church of Geneva. However, she does not find this evidence convincing.&lt;/ref&gt; During his Venetian trial he told inquisitors that while in Geneva he told the Marchese de Vico of Naples, who was notable for helping Italian refugees in Geneva, "I did not intend to adopt the religion of the city. I desired to stay there only that I might live at liberty and in security." Bruno had a pair of breeches made for himself, and the Marchese and others apparently made Bruno a gift of a sword, hat, cape and other necessities for dressing himself; in such clothing Bruno could no longer be recognized as a priest. Things apparently went well for Bruno for a time, as he entered his name in the Rector's Book of the [[University of Geneva]] in May 1579. But in keeping with his personality he could not long remain silent. In August he published an attack on the work of Antoine de la Faye, a distinguished professor. He and the printer were promptly arrested. Rather than apologizing, Bruno insisted on continuing to defend his publication. He was refused the right to take [[sacrament]]. Though this right was eventually restored, he left Geneva.

He went to France, arriving first in [[Lyon]], and thereafter settling for a time (1580–1581) in [[Toulouse]], where he took his doctorate in theology and was elected by students to lecture in philosophy. It seems he also attempted at this time to return to Catholicism, but was denied absolution by the Jesuit priest he approached. When religious strife broke out in the summer of 1581, he moved to Paris. There he held a cycle of thirty lectures on theological topics and also began to gain fame for his prodigious memory. Bruno's feats of memory were based, at least in part, on his elaborate system of mnemonics, but some of his contemporaries found it easier to attribute them to magical powers. His talents attracted the benevolent attention of the king [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]. The king summoned him to the court. Bruno subsequently reported &lt;blockquote&gt;"I got me such a name that King Henry III summoned me one day to discover from me if the memory which I possessed was natural or acquired by magic art. I satisfied him that it did not come from sorcery but from organised knowledge; and, following this, I got a book on memory printed, entitled ''The Shadows of Ideas'', which I dedicated to His Majesty. Forthwith he gave me an Extraordinary Lectureship with a salary."&lt;ref&gt;William Boulting, ''Giordano Bruno: His Life, Thought, and Martyrdom'', 1916, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Paris Bruno enjoyed the protection of his powerful French patrons. During this period, he published several works on mnemonics, including ''[[De umbris idearum]]'' (''On the Shadows of Ideas'', 1582), ''[[Ars Memoriae (book by Giordano Bruno)|Ars Memoriae]]'' (''The Art of Memory'', 1582), and ''[[Circe in the arts#Reasoning beasts|Cantus Circaeus]]'' (''Circe's Song'', 1582). All of these were based on his mnemonic models of organised knowledge and experience, as opposed to the simplistic logic-based mnemonic techniques of [[Petrus Ramus]] then becoming popular. Bruno also published a comedy summarizing some of his philosophical positions, titled ''Il Candelaio'' (''The Torchbearer'', 1582). In the 16th century dedications were, as a rule, approved beforehand, and hence were a way of placing a work under the protection of an individual. Given that Bruno dedicated various works to the likes of King Henry III, Sir [[Philip Sidney]], [[Michel de Castelnau]] (French Ambassador to England), and possibly [[Pope Pius V]], it is apparent that this wanderer had risen sharply in status and moved in powerful circles.

===England, 1583–1585===
[[File:GiordanoBrunomnemonic.gif|thumb|Woodcut illustration of one of Giordano Bruno's less complex mnemonic devices]]
In April 1583, Bruno went to England with letters of recommendation from [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] as a guest of the French ambassador, [[Michel de Castelnau]]. There he became acquainted with the poet [[Philip Sidney]] (to whom he dedicated two books) and other members of the Hermetic circle around [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]], though there is no evidence that Bruno ever met Dee himself. He also lectured at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], and unsuccessfully sought a teaching position there. His views were controversial, notably with [[John Underhill, Bishop of Oxford|John Underhill]], Rector of [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]] and subsequently bishop of Oxford, and [[George Abbot (Archbishop of Canterbury)|George Abbot]], who later became [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Abbot mocked Bruno for supporting "the opinion of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] that the {{sic|earth|expected=Earth}} did go round, and the heavens did stand still; whereas in truth it was his own head which rather did run round, and his brains did not stand still",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Andrew D. |last=Weiner |title=Expelling the Beast: Bruno's Adventures in England |journal=Modern Philology |volume=78 |issue=1 |year=1980 |pages=1–13 |jstor=437245 |doi=10.1086/391002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reports accusations that Bruno plagiarized [[Marsilio Ficino|Ficino]]'s work.

Nevertheless, his stay in England was fruitful. During that time Bruno completed and published some of his most important works, the six "Italian Dialogues," including the [[cosmological tract]]s ''La Cena de le Ceneri'' (''The Ash Wednesday Supper'', 1584), ''De la Causa, Principio et Uno'' (''On Cause, Principle and Unity'', 1584), ''De l'Infinito, Universo e Mondi'' (''On the Infinite, Universe and Worlds'', 1584) as well as ''Lo Spaccio de la Bestia Trionfante'' (''The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast'', 1584) and ''De gl' Heroici Furori'' (''On the Heroic Frenzies'', 1585). Some of these were printed by [[John Charlewood]]. Some of the works that Bruno published in London, notably ''The Ash Wednesday Supper'', appear to have given offense. Once again, Bruno's controversial views and tactless language lost him the support of his friends. John Bossy has advanced the theory that, while staying in the French Embassy in London, Bruno was also spying on Catholic conspirators, under the pseudonym "Henry Fagot', for [[Sir Francis Walsingham]], [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]'s Secretary of State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bossy |first=John |title=Giordano Bruno and the Embassy Affair |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |date=1991 |isbn=0-300-04993-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruno is sometimes cited as being the first to propose that the universe is infinite, which he did during his time in England, but an English scientist, [[Thomas Digges]], put forth this idea in a published work in 1576, some eight years earlier than Bruno.&lt;ref&gt;John Gribbin (2009), ''In Search of the Multiverse: Parallel Worlds, Hidden Dimensions, and the Ultimate Quest for the Frontiers of Reality'', {{ISBN|9780470613528}}. p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last years of wandering, 1585–1592===
In October 1585, after the French embassy in London was attacked by a mob, Bruno returned to Paris with Castelnau, finding a tense political situation. Moreover, his 120 theses against [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] natural science and his pamphlets against the mathematician [[Fabrizio Mordente]] soon put him in ill favor. In 1586, following a violent quarrel about Mordente's invention, the differential compass, he left France for (Germany).

[[File:unamed Figures.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut from "Articuli centum et sexaginta adversus huius tempestatis mathematicos atque philosophos," [[Prague]] 1588]]In Germany he failed to obtain a teaching position at [[Marburg]], but was granted permission to teach at [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|Wittenberg]], where he lectured on [[Aristotle]] for two years. However, with a change of intellectual climate there, he was no longer welcome, and went in 1588 to [[Prague]], where he obtained 300 [[Thaler|taler]] from [[Rudolf II]], but no teaching position. He went on to serve briefly as a professor in [[University of Helmstedt|Helmstedt]], but had to flee again when he was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by the [[Martin Luther|Luther]]ans.

During this period he produced several [[Latin]] works, dictated to his friend and secretary Girolamo Besler, including ''De Magia'' (''On Magic''), ''Theses De Magia'' (''Theses on Magic'') and ''De Vinculis in Genere'' (''A General Account of Bonding''). All these were apparently transcribed or recorded by Besler (or Bisler) between 1589 and 1590.&lt;ref&gt;Giordano Bruno, ''Cause Principle and Unity, and Essays on Magic'', Edited by Richard J. Blackwell and Robert de Lucca, Cambridge, 1998, xxxvi&lt;/ref&gt; He also published ''De Imaginum, Signorum, Et Idearum Compositione'' (''On the Composition of Images, Signs and Ideas'', 1591).

In 1591 he was in [[Frankfurt]]. Apparently, during the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Giordano Bruno: His Life, Thought, and Martyrdom|last=Boulting|first=William|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781138008144|location=|pages=220–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; he received an invitation to Venice from the patrician Giovanni [[Mocenigo family|Mocenigo]], who wished to be instructed in the art of memory, and also heard of a vacant chair in mathematics at the [[University of Padua]]. At the time the [[Inquisition]] seemed to be losing some of its strictness, and because Venice was the most liberal state in Italy, Bruno was lulled into making the fatal mistake of returning to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/82258/Giordano-Bruno/883/Final-years|title=Giordano Bruno|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=8 May 2014|quote=At the time such a move did not seem to be too much of a risk: Venice was by far the most liberal of the Italian states; the European tension had been temporarily eased after the death of the intransigent pope Sixtus V in 1590; the Protestant Henry of Bourbon was now on the throne of France, and a religious pacification seemed to be imminent.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went first to [[Padua]], where he taught briefly, and applied unsuccessfully for the chair of mathematics, which was given instead to [[Galileo Galilei]] one year later. Bruno accepted Mocenigo's invitation and moved to Venice in March 1592. For about two months he served as an in-house tutor to Mocenigo. When Bruno announced his plan to leave Venice to his host, the latter, who was unhappy with the teachings he had received and had apparently come to dislike Bruno, denounced him to the Venetian Inquisition, which had Bruno arrested on 22 May 1592. Among the numerous charges of [[blasphemy]] and [[heresy]] brought against him in Venice, based on Mocenigo's denunciation, was his belief in the [[cosmic pluralism|plurality of worlds]], as well as accusations of personal misconduct. Bruno defended himself skillfully, stressing the philosophical character of some of his positions, denying others and admitting that he had had doubts on some matters of dogma. The Roman Inquisition, however, asked for his transfer to Rome. After several months of argument, the Venetian authorities reluctantly consented and Bruno was sent to Rome in February 1593.

===Imprisonment, trial and execution, 1593–1600===
During the seven years of his trial in Rome, Bruno was held in confinement, lastly in the [[Tower of Nona]]. Some important documents about the trial are lost, but others have been preserved, among them a summary of the proceedings that was rediscovered in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;"II Sommario del Processo di Giordano Bruno, con appendice di Documenti sull'eresia e l'inquisizione a Modena nel secolo XVI", edited by Angelo Mercati, in ''Studi e Testi'', vol. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The numerous charges against Bruno, based on some of his books as well as on witness accounts, included blasphemy, immoral conduct, and heresy in matters of dogmatic theology, and involved some of the basic doctrines of his philosophy and cosmology. [[Luigi Firpo]] speculates the charges made against Bruno by the Roman Inquisition were:&lt;ref&gt;Luigi Firpo, Il processo di Giordano Bruno, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Relief Bruno Campo dei Fiori n1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|border|The trial of Giordano Bruno by the Roman Inquisition. Bronze relief by Ettore Ferrari, [[Campo de' Fiori]], Rome.]]
Bruno defended himself as he had in Venice, insisting that he accepted the Church's dogmatic teachings, but trying to preserve the basis of his philosophy. In particular, he held firm to his belief in the plurality of worlds, although he was admonished to abandon it. His trial was overseen by the Inquisitor Cardinal [[Robert Bellarmine|Bellarmine]], who demanded a full recantation, which Bruno eventually refused. On 20 January 1600, [[Pope Clement VIII]] declared Bruno a heretic and the Inquisition issued a sentence of death. According to the correspondence of [[Caspar Schoppe|Gaspar Schopp]] of [[Breslau]], he is said to have made a threatening gesture towards his judges and to have replied: ''Maiori forsan cum timore sententiam in me fertis quam ego accipiam'' ("Perhaps you pronounce this sentence against me with greater fear than I receive it").&lt;ref&gt;This is discussed in Dorothea Waley Singer, ''Giordano Bruno, His Life and Thought'', New York, 1950, ch. 7, "A gloating account of the whole ritual is given in a letter written on the very day by a youth named Gaspar Schopp of Breslau, a recent convert to Catholicism to whom Pope Clement VIII had shown great favour, creating him Knight of St. Peter and Count of the Sacred Palace. Schopp was addressing Conrad Rittershausen. He recounts that because of his heresy Bruno had been publicly burned that day in the Square of Flowers in front of the Theatre of Pompey. He makes merry over the belief of the Italians that every heretic is a Lutheran. It is evident that he had been present at the interrogations, for he relates in detail the life of Bruno and the works and doctrines for which he had been arraigned, and he gives a vivid account of Bruno's final appearance before his judges on 8th February. To Schopp we owe the knowledge of Bruno's bearing under judgement. When the verdict had been declared, records Schopp, Bruno with a threatening gesture addressed his judges: "Perchance you who pronounce my sentence are in greater fear than I who receive it." Thus he was dismissed to the prison, gloats the convert, "and was given eight days to recant, but in vain. So today he was led to the funeral pyre. When the image of our Saviour was shown to him before his death he angrily rejected it with averted face. Thus my dear Rittershausen is it our custom to proceed against such men or rather indeed such monsters."&lt;/ref&gt;

He was turned over to the secular authorities. On Ash Wednesday, 17 February 1600, in the [[Campo de' Fiori]] (a central Roman market square), with his "tongue imprisoned because of his wicked words". He was hung upside down naked before he was finally [[burned at the stake]].&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fitzgerald|first=Timothy|title=Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b67p1VdF_OoC&amp;pg=PA239|accessdate=11 May 2017|date=4 December 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-804103-0|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Il Sommario del Processo di Giordano Bruno, con appendice di Documenti sull'eresia e l'inquisizione a Modena nel secolo XVI", edited by Angelo Mercati, in ''Studi e Testi'', vol. 101; the precise terminology for the tool used to silence Bruno before burning is recorded as ''una morsa di legno'', or "a vise of wood", and not an iron spike as sometimes claimed by other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; His ashes were thrown into the [[Tiber]] river. All of Bruno's works were placed on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' in 1603.
The inquisition cardinals who judged Giordano Bruno were [[Robert Bellarmine|Cardinal Bellarmino (Bellarmine)]], [[Carlo Gaudenzio Madruzzo|Cardinal Madruzzo (Madruzzi)]], Cardinal Camillo Borghese (later [[Pope Paul V]]), Domenico Cardinal Pinelli, Pompeio Cardinal Arrigoni, [[Paolo Emilio Sfondrati|Cardinal Sfondrati]], [[Pedro de Deza|Pedro Cardinal De Deza Manuel]] and [[Giulio Antonio Santorio|Cardinal Santorio]] (Archbishop of Santa Severina, Cardinal-Bishop of Palestrina).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Physical appearance===
The earliest likeness of Bruno is an engraving published in 1715&lt;ref&gt;Edward A. Gosselin, "A Dominican Head in Layman's Garb? A Correction to the Scientific Iconography of Giordano Bruno", in ''The Sixteenth Century Journal'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Autumn, 1996), p. 674&lt;/ref&gt; and cited by Salvestrini as "the only known portrait of Bruno". Salvestrini suggests that it is a re-engraving made from a now lost original.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This engraving has provided the source for later images.

The records of Bruno's imprisonment by the Venetian inquisition in May 1592 describe him as a man "of average height, with a hazel-coloured beard and the appearance of being about forty years of age".
Alternately, a passage in a work by [[George Abbot (Archbishop of Canterbury)|George Abbot]] indicates that Bruno was of diminutive stature: "When that Italian Didapper, who intituled himselfe Philotheus Iordanus Brunus Nolanus, magis elaboratae Theologiae Doctor, &amp;c. with a name longer than his body...".&lt;ref&gt;Robert McNulty, "Bruno at Oxford", in Renaissance News, 1960 (XIII), pp. 300–305&lt;/ref&gt; The word "didapper" used by Abbot is the derisive term which at the time meant "a small diving waterfowl".&lt;ref&gt;The apparent contradiction is possibly due to different perceptions of "average height" between Oxford and Venice.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cosmology==

===Contemporary cosmological beliefs===
{{See also|Celestial spheres#History}}
[[File:Bartolomeu Velho 1568.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Illuminated illustration of the Ptolemaic geocentric conception of the universe. The outermost text reads "The heavenly empire, dwelling of God and all the selected"]]

In the first half of the 15th century, [[Nicholas of Cusa]] challenged the then widely accepted philosophies of [[Aristotelianism]], envisioning instead an infinite universe whose center was everywhere and circumference nowhere, and moreover teeming with countless stars. He also predicted that neither were the rotational orbits circular nor were their movements uniform.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In the second half of the 16th century, the theories of Copernicus (1473–1543) began diffusing through Europe. Copernicus conserved the idea of planets fixed to solid spheres, but considered the apparent motion of the stars to be an illusion caused by the rotation of the Earth on its axis; he also preserved the notion of an immobile center, but it was the Sun rather than the Earth. Copernicus also argued the Earth was a planet orbiting the Sun once every year. However he maintained the [[Ptolemaic model|Ptolemaic hypothesis]] that the orbits of the planets were composed of perfect circles—[[deferents]] and [[epicycles]]—and that the stars were fixed on a stationary outer sphere.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Despite the widespread publication of Copernicus' work ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', during Bruno's time most educated Catholics subscribed to the Aristotelian [[geocentrism|geocentric]] view that the Earth was the [[History of the Center of the Universe|center of the universe]], and that all heavenly bodies revolved around it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blackwell|first=Richard|title=Galileo, Bellarmine, and the Bible|date=1991|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|location=Notre Dame|isbn=0268010242|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Galileo_Bellarmine_and_the_Bible.html?id=MHnwAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate limit of the universe was the ''primum mobile'', whose diurnal rotation was conferred upon it by a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] God, not part of the universe (although, as the [[Empyrean (disambiguation)|kingdom of heaven]], [[Celestial spheres|adjacent to it]]&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. [[Celestial spheres#mediaviewer/File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|Cosmography by Peter Apian, Antwerp 1539]] and its outer sphere&lt;/ref&gt;), a motionless [[Cosmological argument|prime mover]] and [[first cause]]. The fixed stars were part of this celestial sphere, all at the same fixed distance from the immobile Earth at the center of the sphere. [[Ptolemy]] had numbered these at 1,022, grouped into 48 [[constellation]]s. The [[planet]]s were each fixed to a transparent sphere.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Few [[astronomy|astronomers]] of Bruno's time accepted [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernicus's heliocentric model]]. Among those who did were the Germans [[Michael Maestlin]] (1550–1631), [[Christoph Rothmann]], [[Johannes Kepler]] (1571–1630), the Englishman [[Thomas Digges]], author of ''A Perfit Description of the Caelestial Orbes,'' and the Italian [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642).

===Bruno's cosmological claims===

In 1584, Bruno published two important philosophical dialogues (La Cena de le Ceneri and De l'infinito universo et mondi) in which he argued against the planetary spheres (Christoph Rothmann did the same in 1586 as did [[Tycho Brahe]] in 1587) and affirmed the Copernican principle.

In particular, to support the Copernican view and oppose the objection according to which the motion of the Earth would be perceived by means of the motion of winds, clouds etc., in La Cena de le Ceneri Bruno anticipates some of the arguments of Galilei on the relativity principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Alessandro De Angelis and Catarina Espirito Santo|year = 2015|title = The contribution of Giordano Bruno to the principle of relativity|url = http://www.narit.or.th/en/files/2015JAHHvol18/2015JAHH...18..241D.pdf|journal = Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage|volume = 18|issue = 3|pages = 241–248|arxiv = 1504.01604 |bibcode = 2015JAHH...18..241D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that he also uses the example now known as [[Galileo's ship]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Theophilus  – [...] air through which the clouds and winds move are parts of the Earth, [...] to mean under the name of Earth the whole machinery and the entire animated part, which consists of dissimilar parts; so that the rivers, the rocks, the seas, the whole vaporous and turbulent air, which is enclosed within the highest mountains, should belong to the Earth as its members, just as the air [does] in the lungs and in other cavities of animals by which they breathe, widen their arteries, and other similar effects necessary for life are performed. The clouds, too, move through accidents in the body of the Earth and are in its bowels as are the waters. [...]

With the Earth move [...] all things that are on the Earth.  If, therefore, from a point outside the Earth something were thrown upon the Earth, it would lose, because of the latter's motion, its straightness as would be seen on the ship [...] moving along a river, if someone on point C of the riverbank were to throw a stone along a straight line, and would see the stone miss its target by the amount of the velocity of the ship's motion.  But if someone were placed high on the mast of that ship, move as it may however fast, he would not miss his target at all, so that the stone or some other heavy thing thrown downward would not come along a straight line from the point E which is at the top of the mast, or cage, to the point D which is at the bottom of the mast, or at some point in the bowels and body of the ship.  Thus, if from the point D to the point E someone who is inside the ship would throw a stone straight up, it would return to the bottom along the same line however far the ship moved, provided it was not subject to any pitch and roll."&lt;ref&gt;Giordano Bruno, Teofilo, in La Cena de le Ceneri, "Third Dialogue," (1584), ed. and trans. by S.L. Jaki (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bruno's infinite universe was filled with a substance—a "pure air," [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], or ''spiritus''—that offered no resistance to the heavenly bodies which, in Bruno's view, rather than being fixed, moved under their own [[Impetus (mechanics)|impetus]] (momentum). Most dramatically, he completely abandoned the idea of a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] universe.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The universe is then one, infinite, immobile.... It is not capable of comprehension and therefore is endless and limitless, and to that extent infinite and indeterminable, and consequently immobile.&lt;ref&gt;Giordano Bruno, Teofilo, in Cause, Principle, and Unity, "Fifth Dialogue," (1588), ed. and trans. by Jack Lindsay (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bruno's cosmology distinguishes between "suns" which produce their own light and heat, and have other bodies moving around them; and "earths" which move around suns and receive light and heat from them.&lt;ref name="thirddialogue"&gt;{{cite book

Bruno wrote that other worlds "have no less virtue nor a nature different from that of our Earth" and, like Earth, "contain animals and inhabitants".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |title=Giordano Bruno: On the Infinite Universe and Worlds (De l'Infinito Universo et Mondi) Introductory Epistle: Argument of the Third Dialogue |accessdate=4 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013120648/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |archivedate=13 October 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 16th century, and throughout the 17th century, Bruno's ideas were held up for ridicule, debate, or inspiration. [[Margaret Cavendish]], for example, wrote an entire series of poems against "atoms" and "infinite worlds" in ''Poems and Fancies'' in 1664. Bruno's true, if partial, vindication would have to wait for the implications and impact of [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] cosmology.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Bruno's overall contribution to the birth of modern science is still controversial. Some scholars follow Frances Yates stressing the importance of Bruno's ideas about the universe being infinite and lacking geocentric structure as a crucial crosspoint between the old and the new. Others see in Bruno's idea of multiple worlds instantiating the infinite possibilities of a pristine, indivisible One,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

While most academics note Bruno's theological position as [[pantheism]], physicist and philosopher [[Max Bernhard Weinstein]] in his ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature"), wrote that the theological model of [[pandeism]] was strongly expressed in the teachings of Bruno, especially with respect to the vision of a deity which had no particular relation to one part of the infinite universe more than any other, and was [[Immanence|immanent]], as present on Earth as in the Heavens, subsuming in itself the multiplicity of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Max Bernhard Weinsten, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), p. 321: "Also darf man vielleicht glauben, daß das ganze System eine Erhebung des Physischen aus seiner Natur in das Göttliche ist oder eine Durchstrahlung des Physischen durch das Göttliche; beides eine Art Pandeismus. Und so zeigt sich auch der Begriff Gottes von dem des Universums nicht getrennt; Gott ist naturierende Natur, Weltseele, Weltkraft. Da Bruno durchaus ablehnt, gegen die Religion zu lehren, so hat man solche Angaben wohl umgekehrt zu verstehen: Weltkraft, Weltseele, naturierende Natur, Universum sind in Gott. Gott ist Kraft der Weltkraft, Seele der Weltseele, Natur der Natur, Eins des Universums. Bruno spricht ja auch von mehreren Teilen der universellen Vernunft, des Urvermögens und der Urwirklichkeit. Und damit hängt zusammen, daß für ihn die Welt unendlich ist und ohne Anfang und Ende; sie ist in demselben Sinne allumfassend wie Gott. Aber nicht ganz wie Gott. Gott sei in allem und im einzelnen allumfassend, die Welt jedoch wohl in allem, aber nicht im einzelnen, da sie ja Teile in sich zuläßt."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retrospective views of Bruno==
[[File:Monument to Giordano Bruno in Campo de' Fiori square - Rome, Italy - 6 June 2014.jpg|thumb|The monument to Bruno in the place he was executed, [[Campo de' Fiori]] in Rome]][[File:Monument to Giordano Bruno at Potsdamer Platz in Berlin. Germany.jpg|thumb|Monument to Giordano Bruno at Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, Germany, referencing his burning at the stake while tied upside down.]]

===Late Vatican position===
The Vatican has published few official statements about Bruno's trial and execution. In 1942, Cardinal [[Giovanni Mercati]], who discovered a number of lost documents relating to Bruno's trial, stated that the Church was perfectly justified in condemning him. On the 400th anniversary of Bruno's death, in 2000, Cardinal [[Angelo Sodano]] declared Bruno's death to be a "sad episode" but, despite his regret, he defended Bruno's prosecutors, maintaining that the Inquisitors "had the desire to serve freedom and promote the common good and did everything possible to save his life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seife |first=Charles |title=Vatican Regrets Burning Cosmologist |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2000/03/01-04.html |accessdate=24 June 2012 |newspaper=Science Now |date=1 March 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608054739/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2000/03/01-04.html |archivedate=8 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Pope [[John Paul II]] made a general apology for "the use of violence that some have committed in the service of truth".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= Robinson, B A|date=7 March 2000|title=Apologies by Pope John Paul II|publisher=Ontario Consultants. Retrieved 27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A martyr of science===
Some authors have characterized Bruno as a "martyr of science," suggesting parallels with the [[Galileo affair]] which began around 1610.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/popularsciencemo0712newy#page/110/mode/2up ''"Giordano Bruno and Galileo Galilei,"''] The Popular Science Monthly, Supplement, 1878.&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that, even though Bruno's theological beliefs, or perceptions of them by others, were an important factor in his heresy trial, his [[Nicolaus Copernicus#Copernicanism|Copernicanism]] and cosmological beliefs played a significant role in the outcome.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

"It should not be supposed", writes A. M. Paterson of Bruno and his "heliocentric solar system," that he "reached his conclusions via some mystical revelation....His work is an essential part of the scientific and philosophical developments that he initiated."&lt;ref&gt;Antoinette Mann Paterson (1970). ''The Infinite Worlds of Giordano Bruno''. Charles C. Thomas, Springfield, Illinois, 1970, p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt; Paterson echoes Hegel in writing that Bruno "ushers in a modern theory of knowledge that understands all natural things in the universe to be known by the human mind through the mind's dialectical structure".&lt;ref&gt;Paterson, p.&amp;nbsp;61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ingegno writes that Bruno embraced the philosophy of [[Lucretius]], "aimed at liberating man from the fear of death and the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Cause, Principle and Unity, by Giordano Bruno. Edited by R.J. Blackwell and Robert de Lucca, with an Introduction by Alfonso Ingegno. Cambridge University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Characters in Bruno's ''Cause, Principle and Unity'' desire "to improve speculative science and knowledge of natural things," and to achieve a philosophy "which brings about the perfection of the human intellect most easily and eminently, and most closely corresponds to the truth of nature."&lt;ref&gt;Cause, Principle and Unity, by Giordano Bruno. Edited by R.J. Blackwell and Robert de Lucca, with an Introduction by Alfonso Ingegno. Cambridge University Press, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars oppose such views, and claim Bruno's martyrdom to science to be exaggerated, or outright false. For Yates, while "nineteenth century liberals" were thrown "into ecstasies" over Bruno's Copernicanism, "Bruno pushes Copernicus' scientific work back into a prescientific stage, back into Hermetism, interpreting the Copernican diagram as a hieroglyph of divine mysteries."&lt;ref&gt;Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, by Frances Yates. Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1964, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Mordechai Feingold, "Both admirers and critics of Giordano Bruno basically agree that he was pompous and arrogant, highly valuing his opinions and showing little patience with anyone who even mildly disagreed with him." Discussing Bruno's experience of rejection when he visited Oxford University, Feingold suggests that "it might have been Bruno's manner, his language and his self-assertiveness, rather than his ideas" that caused offence.&lt;ref name="FeingoldVickers1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feingold|first1=Mordechai|last2=Vickers|first2=Brian|title=The occult tradition in the English universities of the Renaissance: a reassessment|year=1984|pages=73–94|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511572999.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theological heresy===
In his ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy'' [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] writes that Bruno's life represented "a bold rejection of all [[Catholic]] beliefs resting on mere authority."&lt;ref&gt;Hegel's lectures on the history of philosophy, translated by E.S. Haldane and F.H. Simson, in three volumes. Volume III, p. 119. The Humanities Press, 1974, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfonso Ingegno states that Bruno's philosophy "challenges the developments of the Reformation, calls into question the truth-value of the whole of Christianity, and claims that Christ perpetrated a deceit on mankind... Bruno suggests that we can now recognize the universal law which controls the perpetual becoming of all things in an infinite universe."&lt;ref name=causa&gt;''Cause, Principle and Unity,'' by Giordano Bruno. Edited by R.J. Blackwell and Robert de Lucca, with an Introduction by Alfonso Ingegno. p.x. Cambridge University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; A. M. Paterson says that, while we no longer have a copy of the official papal condemnation of Bruno, his heresies included "the doctrine of the infinite universe and the innumerable worlds" and his beliefs "on the movement of the earth".&lt;ref&gt;Paterson, p.&amp;nbsp;198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael White notes that the Inquisition may have pursued Bruno early in his life on the basis of his opposition to [[Aristotle]], interest in [[Arianism]], reading of [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]], and possession of banned texts.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;White, Michael. ''The Pope and the Heretic: The True Story of Giordano Bruno, the Man who Dared to Defy the Roman Inquisition,'' p. 7. Perennial, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; White considers that Bruno's later heresy was "multifaceted" and may have rested on his conception of infinite worlds. "This was perhaps the most dangerous notion of all... If other worlds existed with intelligent beings living there, did they too have their visitations? The idea was quite unthinkable."&lt;ref name="white" /&gt;

Frances Yates rejects what she describes as the "legend that Bruno was prosecuted as a philosophical thinker, was burned for his daring views on innumerable worlds or on the movement of the earth." Yates however writes that "the Church was... perfectly within its rights if it included philosophical points in its condemnation of Bruno's heresies" because "the philosophical points were quite inseparable from the heresies."&lt;ref&gt;Yates, Frances, ''Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition,'' pp. 354–356. Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', "in 1600 there was no official Catholic position on the Copernican system, and it was certainly not a heresy. When [...] Bruno [...] was burned at the stake as a heretic, it had nothing to do with his writings in support of Copernican cosmology."&lt;ref&gt;Sheila Rabin, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/copernicus/ "Nicolaus Copernicus"] in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (online. Retrieved 19 November 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The website of the [[Vatican Secret Archives]], discussing a summary of legal proceedings against Bruno in Rome, states: &lt;blockquote&gt;"In the same rooms where Giordano Bruno was questioned, for the same important reasons of the relationship between science and faith, at the dawning of the new astronomy and at the decline of Aristotle's philosophy, sixteen years later, [[Robert Bellarmine|Cardinal Bellarmino]], who then contested Bruno's heretical theses, summoned Galileo Galilei, who also faced a famous inquisitorial trial, which, luckily for him, ended with a simple abjuration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asv.vatican.va/en/doc/1597.htm|title=Summary of the trial against Giordano Bruno: Rome, 1597|publisher=Vatican Secret Archives|accessdate=18 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609095413/http://asv.vatican.va/en/doc/1597.htm|archivedate=9 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Retrospective iconography of Bruno shows him with a Dominican [[cowl]] but not [[tonsure]]d.

An idealized animated version of Bruno appears in the first episode of the 2014 television series ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]''. In this depiction, Bruno is shown with a more modern look, without tonsure and wearing clerical robes and without his hood. ''Cosmos'' presents Bruno as an impoverished philosopher who was ultimately executed due to his refusal to recant his belief in other worlds, a portrayal that was criticized by some as simplistic or historically inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/outthere/2014/03/10/cosmos-pick-wrong-hero/ | title=Did ''Cosmos'' Pick the Wrong Hero? | work=[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]| publisher=[[Kalmbach Publishing]]  | date=10 March 2014 | accessdate=16 March 2014 | author=Powell, Corey S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ncse&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenau|first=Josh|title=Why Did Cosmos Focus on Giordano Bruno?|url=http://ncse.com/blog/2014/03/why-did-cosmos-focus-giordano-bruno-0015457|publisher=National Center for Science Education|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sessions|first=David|title=How 'Cosmos' Bungles the History of Religion and Science|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/23/how-cosmos-bungles-the-history-of-religion-and-science.html|accessdate=8 May 2014|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 song "Roman Sky" by hard rock band [[Avenged Sevenfold]] focuses on the death of Bruno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nash|first1=Lisa|title=Avenged Sevenfold – The Stage (Album Review)|url=http://crypticrock.com/avenged-sevenfold-the-stage-album-review/|accessdate=23 December 2016|work=Cryptic Rock|date=5 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also the song ''"Anima Mundi"'' by Massimiliano Larocca and the album ''Numen Lumen'' by [[neofolk]] group [[Hautville]], which tracks Bruno's lyrics, were dedicated to the philosopher.

==References in poetry==

[[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] wrote a poem honouring Giordano Bruno in 1889, when the statue of Bruno was constructed in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Heather McHugh]] depicted Bruno as the principal of a story told (at dinner, by an "underestimated" travel guide) to a group of contemporary American poets in Rome.  The poem (originally published in McHugh's collection of poems ''Hinge &amp; Sign'', nominee for the [[National Book Award]], and subsequently reprinted widely) channels the very question of [[ars poetica]], or meta-meaning itself, through the embedded narrative of the suppression of Bruno's words, silenced towards the end of his life both literally and literarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voltagepoetry.com/2013/02/21/tom-hunleys-epiphanic-structure-in-heather-mchughs-ars-poetica-what-he-thought/|title=Tom Hunley's "Epiphanic Structure in Heather McHugh's Ars Poetica, ‘What He Thought’" |work=Voltage Poetry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances in fiction==
{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}&lt;!--most of these entries are not cited--&gt;
Bruno and his theory of "the coincidence of contraries" (''coincidentia oppositorum'') play an important role in [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. Joyce wrote in a letter to his patroness, [[Harriet Shaw Weaver]], "His philosophy is a kind of dualism – every power in nature must evolve an opposite in order to realise itself and opposition brings reunion".&lt;ref name="Joyce"&gt;James Joyce, Letter to Harriet Shaw Weaver, 27 January 1925, ''Selected Letters'', p. 307&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst his numerous allusions to Bruno in his novel, including his trial and torture, Joyce plays upon Bruno's notion of ''coincidentia oppositorum'' through applying his name to word puns such as "Browne and Nolan" (the name of Dublin printers) and '"brownesberrow in nolandsland".&lt;ref&gt;McHugh, Roland. Annotations to Finnegans Wake. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 1980. Print, xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Giordano Bruno features as the hero in a series of historical crime novels by S.J. Parris (a pseudonym of [[Stephanie Merritt]]). In order these are ''Heresy'', ''Prophecy'', ''Sacrilege'', ''Treachery'' and ''Conspiracy''.

[[Bertold Brecht]] wrote one of his "Calendar Stories" (Kalendergeschichten) on Bruno Giordano. In ''The heretic's coat'' (''Der Mantel des Ketzers''), Brecht extols Bruno's unwavering honesty and selfless concern for justice.&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, Bertold. Kalendergeschichten. Hamburg: Rowohlt Taschenbuch Verlag, 1978, pp. 38–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Last Confession'' by [[Morris West]] (posthumously published) is a fictional autobiography of Bruno, ostensibly written shortly before his execution.

In 1973 the biographical drama ''[[Giordano Bruno (film)|Giordano Bruno]]'' was released, an Italian/French movie directed by [[Giuliano Montaldo]], starring [[Gian Maria Volontè]] as Bruno.

The computer game ''[[In Memoriam (video game)|In Memoriam]]'' features a lead character who claims to be Bruno, returned from the dead to seek vengeance.

Bruno features as a main character in the historical segments of [[John Crowley]]'s mystical [[Ægypt]] tetralogy of novels. The story covers his education as a Dominican and his investigation for heresy, and presents multiple versions of his execution on the Campo de' Fiori.

Bruno plays a small but significant role in Martin Seay's 2016 novel ''The Mirror Thief''.

Bruno is referenced in [[Natasha Mostert]]'s "Season of the Witch."

His name appears and he is recognized in several novels, including
*''[[Children of God (novel)|Children of God]]'' by [[Mary Doria Russell]].
*''[[The Accidental Time Machine]]'' by [[Joe Haldeman]].
*''[[Tolosa Gold]]'' by [[Justin Hulford]]
*''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' by [[Oscar Wilde]]
*''White Fire'' by [[Douglas Preston]] and [[Lincoln Child]].&lt;ref&gt;p. 542 of White Fire by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[A Discovery of Witches (book series)|A Discovery of Witches]] by [[Deborah Harkness]]
*&lt;!-- Man in the Dark by Paul Auster --&gt;
He is cited and quoted in [[Pauline Hunter Blair]]'s last adult novel, ''Jacob's Ladder'' (Church Farmhouse Books, Bottisham, 2003).

==Giordano Bruno Foundation==
{{Main|Giordano Bruno Foundation}}

The Giordano Bruno Foundation (German: Giordano-Bruno-Stiftung) is a non-profit foundation based in Germany that pursues the "Support of Evolutionary Humanism". It was founded by entrepreneur Herbert Steffen in 2004. The Giordano Bruno Foundation is considered{{by whom|date=February 2015}} critical of religion, which it characterizes as detrimental to cultural evolution.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Giordano Bruno Memorial Award==
The [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI League]] makes an annual award honoring the memory of Giordano Bruno to a deserving person or persons who have made a significant contribution to the practice of [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] (the search for extraterrestrial intelligence). The award was proposed by sociologist Donald Tarter in 1995 on the 395th anniversary of Bruno's death. The trophy presented is called a Bruno.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.setileague.org/awards/bruno.htm|title=The SETI League, Inc. Giordano Bruno Technical Award|last=PhD|first=H.

==Astronomical objects named after Bruno==
The 22&amp;nbsp;km impact crater [[Giordano Bruno (crater)|Giordano Bruno]] on the far side of the Moon is named in his honor, as are the main belt [[Asteroid]]s [[5148 Giordano]] and [[13223 Cenaceneri]]; the latter is named after his philosophical dialogue ''La Cena de le Ceneri''  ("The Ash Wednesday Supper") (see above).

==Other remembrances==
Radio broadcasting station [[2GB]] in Sydney, Australia is named for Bruno. The two letters "GB" in the call sign were chosen to honour Bruno, who was much admired by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] who were the original holders of the station's licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kohn | first = Rachael | title = Theosophy Today | work = The Spirit of Things (Transcript) "Erica Patient: She came into contact with theosophy through 2GB, Station 2GB when it was owned by the Theosophical Society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2955">'''Giuseppe Maria Buondelmonti''' (13 September 1713 - 7 February 1757) was an Italian poet, orator and philosopher.

Buondelmonti was born into a noble family, and was raised highly educated. He attended the [[University of Pisa]], but was unable to graduate due to health issues. During this time he did write poetry, literary critiques, entries for an encyclopedia that was being put together, and a number of funeral orations.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giuseppe-maria-buondelmonti_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/|title=Encyclopedia Italiana listing for Giuseppe Maria Buondelmonti (Italian)|accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in his 20s he joined the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], a decision which would have exposed him to serious danger, but he had the protection of his noble family's political connections to protect him.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/loggia_firenze.html|title=Noted Italian Freemasons - Giuseppe Maria Buondelmonti (Italian)|accessdate=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved in the church, where he was granted the rank [[Knights Hospitaller|Knight Commander of the Order of Malta]]. This degree admitted him into the clerical hierarchy, where he could be called "Fra Giuseppe Maria" and would attend mass every day.

In 1751, Buondelmonti was elected to the [[Accademia della Crusca|Academy of the bran]]. Over the next 5 years he wrote a number of works on philosophy, specifically the principles of [[natural law]]. Sickly throughout its life, Buondelmonti died on 7 February 1757 in [[Pisa]]. He was buried in the church of [[San Michele in Borgo]], where there is an inscription in his memory.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

'''HDIV''' is a free and open-source '''Web Application Security Framework''' that eliminates or mitigates web security risks for some of the most used web frameworks, maintaining the [[Application programming interface|API]] and the framework specification, such as [[Spring Framework#Model-view-controller framework|Spring MVC]], [[Grails (framework)|Grails]], [[JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library|JSTL]], [[Apache Struts|Struts 1]], [[Apache Struts 2|Struts 2]], [[JavaServer Faces]], [[ASP.NET MVC]], Web Forms, [[Symfony]]. HDIV is released under the [[Apache License|Apache 2.0 license]].&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/hdiv/hdiv#user-content-license&lt;/ref&gt;

== OWASP Top 10 ==
* '''A1 (Injection) :''' Injection flaws, such as SQL, OS, and LDAP injection occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization. HDIV minimizes the existence of untrusted data thanks to the web information flow control system that avoid the manipulation of the data generated by the server side. This architecture minimize the risk to just the new data generated legally from editable form elements. It is important to note that even using PreparedStatement if the query is based on untrusted data generated previously at server side (for instance the identification ID of an item within a list) it is possible to exist an SQL injection risk. In addition to that HDIV implements an internal system that detect [[SQL injection|SQL Injection]] risks within source-code.
* '''A2 (Broken authentication and session management) :''' Application functions related to authentication and session management are often not implemented correctly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities. HDIV doesn’t create a parallel authentication system delegating this responsibility to application servers.
* '''A3 (XSS) :''' [[Cross-site scripting|XSS]] flaws occur whenever an application takes untrusted data and sends it to a web browser without proper validation or escaping. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites. HDIV minimizes the existence of untrusted data thanks to the web information flow control system implement by HDIV, minimizing the risk to the new data generated legally from editable form elements. In addition to that HDIV implements an internal system that detects XSS risks within source-code.
* '''A4 (Insecure direct object reference) :''' A direct object reference occurs when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, or database key. Without an access control check or other protection, attackers can manipulate these references to access unauthorized data. The source of the problem of this risk is based on the manipulation or updating of the data generated previously at server side. For instance a list is sent to the client with an ID for each item. The client manipulated the ID and try to access to a forbidden id. HDIV web information flow control system control all the data generated at server side ensuring the integrity of the data generated at serve side. In addition to that and optionally is possible to ensure the confidentiality of the data generated at server side avoiding the exposition of critical (such as credit cards, etc.).
* '''A5 (security misconfiguration) :''' Good security requires having a secure configuration defined and deployed for the application, frameworks, application server, web server, database server, and platform. Secure settings should be defined, implemented, and maintained, as defaults are often insecure. Additionally, software should be kept up to date. Current application security architectures does not follow security by default approach, on the contrary, the programmers must apply security configuration to avoid the access to private or confidential resources. Thanks to the information flow control system implemented by HDIV all the resources (links and forms) exposed by the application are controlled by HDIV and doesn't allow to break the original contract offered by the server. In other words, even when the programmer doesn’t use access control systems or ACL ([[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition|Java EE]] or [[Spring Security]]) HDIV is able to know which resource is accessible by each user.
* '''A6 (Sensitive data exposure) :''' Many web applications do not properly protect sensitive data, such as credit cards, tax IDs, and authentication credentials. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data deserves extra protection such as encryption at rest or in transit, as well as special precautions when exchanged with the browser. HDIV offers a confidentially property to all data generated at server side. That is to say, HDIV replace original parameter values generated at server side by relative values (0,1,2,4, etc.) that avoid exposing critical data to the client side.
* '''A7 (Missing function level access control) :''' Most web applications verify function level access rights before making that functionality visible in the UI. However, applications need to perform the same access control checks on the server when each function is accessed. If requests are not verified, attackers will be able to forge requests in order to access functionality without proper authorization. Current application security architectures doesn’t follow security by default approach, on the contrary, the programmers must apply security controls to avoid the access to private or confidential resources. Thanks to the information flow control system implemented by HDIV all the resources (links and forms) exposed by the application are controlled by HDIV and does not allow breaking the original contract offered by the server. In other words, even when the programmer doesn’t use access control systems or ACL ([[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition|Java EE]] or [[Spring Security]]) HDIV is able to know which resource is accessible by each user.
* '''A8 (CSRF) :''' A [[Cross-site request forgery|CSRF]] attack forces a logged-on victim’s browser to send a forged HTTP request, including the victim’s session cookie and any other automatically included authentication information, to a vulnerable web application. This allows the attacker to force the victim’s browser to generate requests the vulnerable application thinks are legitimate requests from the victim. HDIV adds random tokens to each link or form existing within the application. It makes extremely difficult to implement an CSRF attack because the attacker does not know which is the value. In order to offer an extreme security level HDIV does not use a random token per session and creates a new token for each requested page. Even the token used by links and forms within the same page are different avoiding the reuse of link tokens to exploit a web form. One token is created for data retrieval requests (GET, HEAD, TRACE and OPTIONS HTTP methods) and another for data modification (POST, PATCH, PUT and DELETE methods).
* '''A9 (using components with known vulnerabilities) :''' Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, almost always run with full privileges. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover. Applications using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable a range of possible attacks and impacts. Although HDIV can’t update the base software of web applications and is advisable to update the software versions to the latest, the web information flow control system implemented by HDIV avoid and makes more difficult to exploit many or known and unknown of the vulnerabilities of base software. In other words, in many cases (see: Struts cancel vulnerability), the risks are based on an unexpected use of a web application. HDIV doesn't allow to break the original contract and thanks to this property it is more difficult to exploit existing risks.
* '''A10 (Unvalidated redirects and forwards) :''' Web applications frequently redirect and forward users to other pages and websites, and use untrusted data to determine the destination pages. Without proper validation, attackers can redirect victims to phishing or malware sites, or use forwards to access unauthorized pages. This vulnerability is mainly related with the manipulation of readonly data or data generated previously at server side. HDIV controls all the data server by the server and does not allow the redirection to malicious web sites.

'''Hail and Farewell''' (a translation of ''ave atque vale'', last words of the poem [[Catullus 101]]) is a traditional military event whereby those coming to and departing from an organization are celebrated. This may coincide with a change in command, be scheduled on an annual basis, or be prompted by any momentous organizational change. It is a time to honor those who have departed the unit and thank them for their service. At the same time it is a welcome to those who are joining and introduces them to the special history and traditions of their new organization. This celebration builds organizational camaraderie and [[esprit de corps]]. It supports a sense of continuity through change.

==United States==
For the [[United States Army]], a Hail and Farewell is most often celebrated at a formal [[dining in]] when there is a change in command. This provides the unit with a formal setting in which to welcome the new commander and honor the old commander. Some units may elect a less formal [[Dining Out]] in which family member and other non-military guests are encouraged to take place in the unit change. There are no official requirements outlined by the United States Army to have a Hail and Farewell celebration. It is up to each unit to carry out this tradition as they see fit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=

The [[United States Navy]], on the other hand, has specified that by custom the ship's officers must give a formal dinner when their new captain arrives. There may also be a formal dinner for the departing captain and these may be combined into one formal Hail and Farewell dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=

[[File:Kanzan and Jittoku by SesshûTôyô, Muromachi.jpg|thumb|320x320px|''Kanzan and Jittoku'' by Sesshū Tōyō, Muromachi period]]
[[Hanshan (poet)|'''Hanshan''']] 寒山 and [[Shide (monk)|'''Shide''']] 拾得 (Japanese: Kanzan and Jittoku) are popular figures in Zen painting. They have been depicted many times as a pair, and the duo has become an identifiable motif in Zen painting and representative of deeper meanings in Zen Buddhism as a whole. Hanshan, whose name means “Cold Mountain,” is believed to be an eccentric Zen poet from the [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]] (618-907) who lived on the Tiantang Mountain in Zhejiang Province. Shide, whose name means “foundling” or “pickup,” was a kitchen worker at the nearby Guoqing Temple. He is said to have been abandoned by his family, and then found and raised by [[Fenggan]], another Zen eccentric. As legend goes, the two formed a close friendship, with Shide stealing scraps from the kitchen to bring to Hanshan, and the pair spending time in nature, away from societal structure and institutions. Little is verified about the lives of these two figures, and they “have come to exist only in the works they have left behind&lt;ref&gt;Robert Borgen “The Legend of Hanshan: A Neglected Source.” www.jstor.org/stable/604274&lt;/ref&gt;.”

Hanshan and Shide are easily recognizable in Zen painting. They are almost always depicted wearing scrappy and ratty clothing, appearing disheveled, wandering in nature, laughing, or with mischievous looks on their faces. Hanshan is identified by the scroll he holds in his hand, alluding to his work as a poet. Shide is identified by the broom he holds, which references his work as a kitchen cleaner at the monastery. 

== Significance and Symbolism ==
The figures Hanshan and Shide, while often depicted simply and with humor, carry deep symbolism for the religion of Zen Buddhism as a whole. As seen in the attached images, Hanshan’s scroll is often depicted blank. This indicates “that written or printed sutras are nothing compared to the book of nature.” Shide’s broom can be read as a tool to “sweep out of the cobwebs in our impure souls.” Their carefree attitude symbolizes their knowledge that “the things which most men strive for are illusions, and that what really counts is not rank or riches but their own Buddha nature&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Munsterberg, “Zen and Art.” www.jstor.org/stable/774379&lt;/ref&gt;.” Additionally, “in these lunatic figures the Zen artists portray something slightly more than a parody of their own wu-shin or mindless way of life, for as genius is to madness close allied there is a suggestive parallel between the meaningless babble of the happy lunatic and the purposeless life of the Zen sage&lt;ref&gt;Alan Watts. “The Way of Zen.” The Way of Zen. Vintage Books, 1999, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;.” Hanshan and Shide serve the purpose of causing viewers to “confront the fundamental meaning of their own existence&lt;ref&gt;Katsuhiro Yoshizawa, The Religious Art of Zen Master Hakuin, (Counterpoint: 2009), https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/georgetown/detail.action?docID=478380.&lt;/ref&gt;.”

Many scholars during the [[Muromachi period]] regarded Hanshan and Shide to be incarnations of the bodhisattvas [[Manjushri|Mañjuśrī]] (Monju) and [[Samantabhadra|Samantabadhra]] (Fugen)&lt;ref&gt;“Itō Jakuchū | Hanshan and Shide (Japanese: Kanzan and Jittoku) | Japan | Edo Period (1615–1868) | The Met,” www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/670929.&lt;/ref&gt;. These bodhisattvas represent wisdom and Buddhist practice respectively, perhaps creating a parallel between the wisdom and practice of Hanshan and Shide. Mañjuśrī is often connected to poetry, oratory, and writing, in the same way that Hanshan is connected to his own poems. This comparison suggests the hidden significance of these otherwise eccentric and simple characters&lt;ref&gt;Tim Lerch, “Manjushri and Samantabhadra,” https://kwanumzen.org/teaching-library/2003/09/01/manjushri-and-samantabhadra&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Visual Representations ==

=== Four Sleepers ===
Early representations of Hanshan and Shide in Zen painting can be found in images depicting the “Four Sleepers.” The exact creation of this theme is unclear, though it is believed to have been established as a part of Zen painting in China by the early thirteenth century. “The earliest reference known to us concerning the artistic treatment of the subject is a poem in the Rujing Heshang yulu composed by the Chinese abbot Changweng Rujing (1163-1228) for a now lost painting of the ‘Four Sleepers&lt;ref name="''brinker''"&gt;Helmut Brinker “ZEN Masters of Meditation in Images and Writings,” www.jstor.org/stable/1522704&lt;/ref&gt;.’”

One example of early renderings of the “Four Sleepers” is by the Japanese artist [[Mokuan Reien|Mokuan]]. In Mokuan’s “Four Sleepers,” Hanshan and Shide are seen sleeping soundly on the ground with Fenggan (the Zen master who found and raised Shide) and Fenggan’s tiger. The inscription on this hanging scroll reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;“Old Fenggan embraces his tiger and sleeps, &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;All huddled together with Shide and Hanshan. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;They dream their big dream, which lingers on&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Levine and Yukio Lippit, Awakenings: Zen Figure Painting in Medieval Japan, (Japan Society: 2007), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;The imagery of the Four Sleepers was made popular in Japan through paintings imported from China. Japanese interpretations of the theme emerged as early as the fourteenth century&lt;ref name="''tawaraya''"&gt;“Tawaraya Sōtatsu | The Four Sleepers | Japan | Edo Period (1615–1868) | The Met,” metmuseum.org/exhibitions/view?exhibitionId=%7B5bc821dc-2782-4897-854f-ebbdc0f09577%7D&amp;oid=77247.&lt;/ref&gt;.'"

Images of the Four Sleepers are meant to symbolize “peaceful coexistence with nature and the enlightened mind&lt;ref name="''tawaraya''" /&gt;,” as the three men sleep soundly among a tiger and outdoors, in nature. Additionally, the sleeping figures hint at a “dream world that cannot be represented on paper” or a “peacefulness of Enlightenment that cannot be attained in the waking world&lt;ref&gt;“World Art.” Annenberg Learner, www.learner.org/courses/globalart/work/61/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;.” Key themes of Zen Buddhism are given shape in images of the Four Sleepers, such as the non-duality of man and animal sleeping peacefully, the serenity of enlightenment, and expunging of opposite figures and forces&lt;ref name="''brinker''" /&gt;.

=== Representations as a pair ===
Hanshan and Shide are most commonly depicted with just one another. In Zen painting, the two eccentrics are typically shown laughing uproariously, frequently at a Zen joke and at the expense of the “pompous monks” at their monastery&lt;ref&gt;“Kanzan &amp; Jittoku by Chuzan.” Robyn Buntin of Honolulu Gallery, www.robynbuntin.com/Kanzan-Jittoku-p/4524.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;. Hanshan and Shide wear shabby clothing and are easily identifiable by their scroll and broom, respectively. Over centuries, Zen painters have depicted these figures in different styles and manners, though keep to the main themes, motifs, and ideas that the pair represents.

[[File:Zen Eccentrics Hanshan and Shide by Kao Ninga, 14th century.jpg|thumb|251x251px|''Zen Eccentrics Hanshan and Shide'' by Kaō Ninga, Nanbokuchō period, 14th century, ink on paper, Tokyo National Museum]]Paintings of Hanshan and Shide were favored among Zen monks following the [[Song dynasty|Chinese Song Dynasty]] (960-1279), and grew in popularity in the 13th and 14th centuries in China and Japan&lt;ref&gt;“Hanshan and Shide.” Yintuolo: Hanshan and Shide | Chinese Painting | China Online Museum, www.chinaonlinemuseum.com/painting-yintuolo-hanshan-and-shide.php&lt;/ref&gt;. During the 14th century, important Zen painters like Yintuoluo, a Chan monk born in India who lived in China during the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan Dynasty]] (1279-1368), created images of Hanshan and Shide that are now considered national treasures in Japan. During this period, painters followed traditional standards for figure painting, with a combination of thin and delicate lines to render their faces and thicker lines on their bodies. These images were almost always accompanied by an inscription, though not all have been translated or attributed to an author. This style of painting is also exemplified through Kao Ninga’s ''Zen Eccentrics Hanshan and Shide'', a pair of paintings depicting the figures.

===== 15th Century =====

[[File:豊干寒山拾得図-Fenggan, Hanshan, and Shide MET DP361145.jpg|thumb|267x267px|''Fenggan, Hanshan, and Shide'' by Resai, Muromachi Period, 1st half of the 15th century, ink and color on paper, Metropolitan Museum of Art]][[File:伊藤若冲筆 伝池大雅賛 寒山拾得図-Hanshan and Shide (Japanese- Kanzan and Jittoku) MET DP-12232-277.jpg|thumb|''Hanshan and Shide'' by Ike Taiga, late 18th century, ink on paper, Metropolitan Museum of Art]]The subject of Hanshan and Shide remained popular in Zen painting in the 15th century. During the [[Muromachi period|Muromachi Period]] (1392-1573) in Japan, artists like Resai experimented with color and tonality more so than in previous centuries. Resai’s depiction of Hanshan and Shide is complex and contemplative, as the pair is seen on the pair on a mountain’s edge with a vast space of nothingness beyond where they stand. They are shown in discussion and pointing out to the nothingness, perhaps exploring different facets of enlightenment as they often did. There are varying tones of ink, and areas are shaded and filled in. Resai stays true to common themes with Hanshan and Shide, showing their scroll, broom, joyous faces, and depicting them in nature.

Also painting during the Muromachi period was [[Sesshū Tōyō]], who is described as the most prominent master of ink painting from this time. Sesshu Toyo’s painting of Kanzan and Jittoku differs from others seen, as it is a bust length image of the two figures’ faces. Sesshu Toyo pays great attention to rendering their emotions and mischievous glances, as they laugh together while Kanzan holds a blank scroll. Through this, he captures the essence of the two figures. Sesshu Toyo employs variation in ink tonalities and in the thickness of his lines. There is three dimensional modeling to the faces and hands of the figures, demonstrating a more elevated and advanced style of painting.

==== Modern Representations ====
Representations of Hanshan and Shide remained very popular in Japan in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, and well into the 19th century.

In the late 18th century, during the [[Edo period|Edo Period]] (1615-1868), Ito Jakuchu painted ''Hanshan and Shide (Kanzan and Jittoku)''. His rendition is more abstract than any of the aforementioned paintings. The figures are depicted embracing and in opposites – one in a black robe and one in a white robe, with a scroll at their feet and a broom rising up. There is no background, placing the focus on the figures themselves. The inscription is attributed to Ike Taiga (Japanese, 1723-1776) and reads:&lt;blockquote&gt;"One is the Bodhisattva of the Great Path,&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The other is the Patriarch of the Great Buddha.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;What evidence is there? A broken broom, a tattered scripture, and unrhymed verse.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Kanzan, Jittoku shizuki-zu by Mochizuki Gyokusen.jpg|left|thumb|344x344px|''Hanshan and Shide'' by Mochizuki Gyokusen, 19th century, Museum of Fine Arts Boston]]

The inscription references their emanations of Mañjuśrī (Monju) and Samantabadhra (Fugen).

In the 19th century, Japanese Zen painter Mochizuki Gyokuzen created a hanging scroll depicting the pair. Here, we see a shift in style from previous centuries. This painting is done in a more graphic manner, and Mochizuki Gyokuzen employs different colors and sharper lines to create a more cartoon-looking image of the pair. The figures are emotive and looking upwards at something outside of the picture frame, rather than at a scroll. Still, we see the common motifs of the ragged clothing, the broom, and the blank scroll in Kanzan’s hand.

Also in the 19th century, during the [[Meiji period|Meiji Period]] (1868-1912), was Hashimoto Gahō. His hanging scroll depicting the pair is done in ink and slight tint on paper, harkening back to the simple ink and wash paintings of previous centuries, though done in a far more modern manner. Hashimoto Gaho employs variations in ink tonalities and texture, as seen through the fuzzy hair, the different tones of the ground they stand on, and the fur on Kanzan’s skirt. Jittoku is seen laughing and pointing to the blank scroll, while Kanzan looks on in amusement. The faces of the two figures are three dimensionally modeled, making them appear more realistic and modern than past renderings. The tree branches point downward to the characters to direct the attention of viewers. Nearly every common motif associated with the figures are employed in this painting, though it is done in a modern and expressive manner&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freersackler.si.edu/friday-fave-chinese-taoist-immortals/|title=Friday Fave: Chinese Taoist Immortals – Freer{{!}}Sackler|website=www.freersackler.si.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{nihongo|'''Hayashi Akira'''|林 韑||February 10, 1800 – October 12, 1859}} (also known as ''Hayashi Fukusai'') was an [[Edo period]] scholar-diplomat serving the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in a variety of roles similar to those performed by serial [[Hayashi clan (Confucian scholars)|Hayashi clan]] [[Neo-Confucianism|neo-Confucianists]] since the time of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. He was the hereditary ''[[Daigaku-no-kami]]'' descendant of [[Hayashi Razan]], the first head of the Tokugawa shogunate's neo-Confucian academy in [[Edo]], the ''Shōhei-kō'' (''[[Yushima Seidō]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Screech, Timon. (2006). ''Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779–1822,'' p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academician==
Hayashi ''Daigaku-no-kami'' Akira was a member of the [[Hayashi clan (Confucian scholars)|Hayashi clan]] of Confucian scholars, each of whom were ''ad hoc'' personal advisers to the shōgun's prominent figures in the educational training system for the shogunal bureaucrats.  The progenitor of this lineage of scholars was [[Hayashi Razan]], who lived to witness his philosophical and pragmatic reasoning become a foundation for the dominant ideology of the ''[[bakufu]]'' until the end of the 19th century.

This evolution developed in part from the official Hayashi ''[[Model (abstract)|schema]]'' equating samurai with the cultured governing class (although the samurai were largely illiterate at the beginning of the Tokugawa shogunate).  The Hayashi helped to legitimize the role of the militaristic ''bakufu'' at the beginning of its existence.  His philosophy is also important in that it encouraged the samurai class to cultivate themselves, a trend which would become increasingly widespread over the course of his lifetime and beyond.  One of Razan's aphorism encapsulates this view:
:::"No true learning without arms and no true arms without learning."&lt;ref&gt;Blomberg, Catherina. (1999). ''The Heart of the Warrior,'' p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hayashi played a prominent role is helping to maintain the theoretical underpinnings of the Tokugawa regime; and Hayashi ''Daigaku-no-kami'' Akira was the 11th hereditary rector of ''Yushima Seidō''.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley, William G. (1955). ''Select Documents on Japanese Foreign Policy, 1853-1868,'' p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomat==
Akira assumed his role as [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the academy in 1853; and his initial foray into diplomacy followed soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, L.M. (2003). ''A History of Japan, 1582–1941: Internal and External Worlds,''  p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1853''' (''[[Kaei]] 6''): Akira completed ''[[Tsūkō ichiran]]''.  The work was created under orders from the shogunate to compile and edit documents pertaining to East Asian trade and diplomacy; and, for example, it includes a detailed description of a Ryukyuan tribute embassy to the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] court in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;Smits, Gregory. (1999). ''Visions of Ryukyu: Identity and Ideology in Early-Modern Thought and Politics,'' p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''March 8, 1854''' (''Kaei 7'', 10th day of the 2nd month'')&lt;!-- NengoCalc 嘉永七年二月十日 --&gt;: Commodore Perry returned to [[Edo Bay]] to force Japanese agreement to the [[Treaty of Kanagawa]]; and the chief Japanese negotiator was ''Daigaku-no kami'' Hayashi Akira,&lt;ref name="c178n11"&gt;Cullen, p. 178 n11.&lt;/ref&gt; who was known to the Americans as "Prince Commissioner Hayashi."&lt;ref&gt;Sewall, John. (1905). ''The Logbook of the Capatin's Clerk: Adventures in the China Seas,'' p.lxiv; Cullen, Louis. (2003). ''A History of Japan, 1582–1941: Internal and External Worlds,''  p. 178 n11.&lt;/ref&gt;
::"Immediately, on signing and exchanging copies of the treaty, Commodore Perry presented the first commissioner, Prince Hayashi, with an American flag stating that this gift was the highest expression of national courtesy and friendship he could offer.  The prince was deeply moved, and expressed his gratitude with evident feeling.  The commodore next presented the other commissioners with gifts he had especially reserved for them.  All business now having been concluded to the satisfaction of both delegations, the Japanese commissioners invited Perry and his officers to enjoy a feast and entertainment especially prepared for the celebration." -- ''from American eyewitness account of the event''&lt;ref&gt;Sewall, p. lxxiii; Hawks, Francis. (1856). ''Narrative of the Expedition of an American Squadron to the China Seas and Japan Performed in the Years 1852, 1853 and 1854 under the Command of Commodore M.C. Perry, United States Navy, '' Vol.I, pp. 377-380.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''January 22, 1858''' (''Ansei 4, 28th day of the 12th month''): Akira headed the shogunal delegation which sought advice from [[Emperor Kōmei]] in deciding how to deal with newly assertive foreign powers.&lt;ref name="c178n11" /&gt;
  
Significantly, this would have been the first time the emperor's counsel was actively sought since the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate.  The most easily identified consequence of this transitional overture would be the increased numbers of messengers which were constantly streaming back and forth between Tokyo and Kyoto during the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1956). ''Kyoto: the Old Capital, 794–1869,'' p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no small irony in the fact that this 19th-century scholar/bureaucrat would find himself at a crucial nexus of managing political change—moving arguably "by the book" through uncharted waters with well-settled theories as the only guide.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, pp. 173–185&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''''Ansei 4''''' (October 1858): Akira is dispatched from Edo to Kyoto to explain the terms of the treaty to Emperor Kōmei, who ultimately acquiesced in February 1859 when he came to understand that there was no alternative to acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical theory in Greek culture predates philosophical reflection. The main ethical category for ancient Greeks was [[Arete (moral virtue)|aretē]], which is usually translated into English as "virtue" but sometimes as "excellence," which is closer in meaning.   Aretē means an excellence of strength or ability, and is ultimately bound up with the notion of the fulfillment of purpose or function: the act of living up to one's full potential. The objective of a successful life was attaining [[timē]], or honor. Also an important concept in Greek culture was that of [[hubris|hybris]], trying to go beyond one's possibilities. The literary source of this folk ethical theory can be seen in [[Homer]], [[Greek tragedy]] and also [[Aesop]]'s fables. 

The first philosophers, the [[Presocratics]], occasionally reflected on ethics. [[Heraclitus]] thought that [[injustice]] appears only in the eyes of men, and that a divine perspective would show that everything is just. [[Pythagoras]] founded a sect in which a good reincarnation ([[metempsychosis]]) was to be attained through following certain ascetic practices. [[Democritus]] proposed cheerfulness as the supreme goal of life.

An important change came with the [[Sophist]] movement, who resembled professional teachers. They traveled from one [[polis|city]] to another, and were concerned with ethical problems. [[Protagoras]] was a sophist and the first formulator of [[relativism]] in Western thought. By saying man is the measure of all things, he attacked the unchallenged notion of a fixed reality.

[[Socrates]] was a milestone in the history of ethics. He regarded for the first time aretē as the rational part of the human soul/mind (''psychē'').

'''Izchak Miller''' (September, 1935 – April 1, 1994) was a philosopher and author, known, among other things, for his scholarly writings on [[Edmund Husserl]] and his contributions to Husserlian [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref name=blade&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19940408&amp;id=SFdPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XwMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4164,2117408|title=Izchak Miller|work=[[Toledo Blade]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=April 8, 1994|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Miller was a coordinator of the Cognitive Science Research Group at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] from 1985 to 1986, and was an Assistant Professor in the Philosophy department from 1982 to 1988. He later joined the faculty of [[Yeshiva University]] in 1993, and also taught at [[Stanford University]], [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], [[Brandeis University|Brandeis University,]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], where he held his first professorship from 1973 to 1977.&lt;ref name=blade/&gt; In addition, he was employed at the [[Xerox]] [[PARC (company)|Palo Alto Research Center]] (PARC) for a period of time.&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/01/27/nethack/|title=The best game ever|last=Au|first=Wagner James|work=[[Salon.com]]|date=January 27, 2000|accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller received both his baccalaureate and doctoral degrees in Philosophy from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. He belongs to a school of phenomenology called West Coast Phenomenology, along with contemporaries [[Dagfinn Føllesdal]], Ronald McIntyre and David Woodruff Smith.

Miller died of [[cancer]] in [[New York City]] on April 1, 1994, at the age of 58.&lt;ref name=blade/&gt;

== NetHack ==

In addition to his academic career, Miller was also one of the core developers of the [[NetHack]] computer game from 1986 up to his death; version 3.2 of NetHack, the first to come out after his death, was dedicated to his memory. He appears in the game as the owner of a lighting store.&lt;ref name=salon/&gt; Also in honor of him, it is considered bad form to harm him in contrast to other creatures.&lt;ref&gt;https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Izchak#Etiquette&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4783">'''John '''('''Johannes''')''' Hennon''' (died after 1484) was a Dutch [[medieval philosopher]] in the late [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] tradition. He was from [[Nijmegen]], and studied at the [[University of Paris]], where he received his ''[[magister artium]]'' and ''[[Bachelor of theology|baccalaureus formatus in sacra pagina]]'' (1463).

As a student of Paris, Hennon was heavily influenced by [[William of Ockham]] and [[Roger Bacon]]. He wrote a [[Latin]] commentary on the ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' of [[Aristotle]], the ''Commentarii in Aristotelis libros Physicorum'', which was completed on 1 October 1473 if a seventeenth-century source is to be believed.&lt;ref&gt;The manuscript is preserved in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], ''fonds latin'', no. 6529. The commentaries begin on folio 4r, where in the seventeenth century somebody wrote: ''Magistri Johannis Hennon Commentarii in Aristotelis libros Physicorum, parva naturalis et metaphysicam, completi die prima octobris anno 1473, ut habetur in ultima pagina hujus libri''.&lt;/ref&gt; Examining the state of [[Medieval science|science in the late Middle Ages]], physicist, historian, and philosopher [[Pierre Duhem]], in ''Le système du monde'', isolates Hennon's account of the [[vacuum]] and [[Multiverse|a plurality of worlds]].

Hennon believed that [[nature abhors a vacuum]] and therefore no natural [[Void (astronomy)|void]] was possible, though [[God]] could create one. A void, however, is not defined by a positive distance between surfaces in which there is nothing, but rather as the capacity (''potentialitas'') for a body to be interposed between the two surfaces equal to that which is there when it is full. Hennon affirms that ice is denser than liquid water, and that a sealed vase of water will break upon freezing because nature abhors a vacuum. He believes further that two smooth plates could not be separated (again, because nature abhors a vacuum) unless there were some air still between them, which with enough force may become [[rarefied]], allowing the plates to be separated.

Hennon is less original on a plurality of worlds, where he borrows text verbatim from [[Albert of Saxony]]'s ''Quaestiones in libros de Caelo et Mundo''. He follows Albert and [[John Buridan]] in asserting that a multiplicity of worlds is not contradictory and therefore possible through divien [[omnipotence]]. In fact, God could create an infinite multitude of beings, since Hennon finds no contradiction between [[infinity]] and [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]]. Duhem in his analysis of Hennon's chapter ''De Caelo et Mundo'', argues that Hennon relied on the [[Condemnations (University of Paris)|Condemnations of 1277]] by [[Stephen Tempier]] to attack [[Aristotelian physics]], and thus the position that the earth cannot move.&lt;ref&gt;Hennon refers to the specific article of condemnation ''Quod Deus non posset movere Caelum motus recto, error'': "That God could not move the heavens with [[rectilinear motion]], an error".&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4937">The '''Laws of Eshnunna''' (abrv. LE) are inscribed on two [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablets discovered in [[Shaduppum|Tell Abū Harmal]], [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]]. The Iraqi Directorate of Antiquities headed by [[Taha Baqir]] unearthed two parallel sets of tablets in 1945 and 1947. The two tablets are separate copies of an older source and date back to ca. 1930 BC. The differences between the [[Code of Hammurabi]] and the Laws of [[Eshnunna]] significantly contributed to illuminating the development of ancient and [[cuneiform law]]. [[Eshnunna]] was north of [[Ur]] on the [[Tigris]] River and became politically important after the fall of the third dynasty of Ur, founded by [[Ur-Nammu]]. 

In distinction from the other [[Mesopotamia]]n collections of law, this one got its name after the city where it had originated – [[Eshnunna]], located on the bank of the [[Diyala River]], tributary to the [[Tigris]]. This collection of laws is not a real systemized [[codex]]; nearly sixty of its sections are preserved. The Laws are written in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] and consist of two tablets which are marked with A and B. In 1948, [[Albrecht Goetze]] of the [[Yale University]] had translated and published them. In some sources the Laws of [[Eshnunna]] are mentioned as the Laws of [[Bilalama]] due to the belief that the Eshnunnian ruler probably was their originator, but Goetze maintained that tablet B was originated under the reign of [[Dadusha]]. The text of the [[prologue]] is [[lacuna (manuscript)|broken]] at the point where the ruler who promulgated the laws was specified.

[[Albrecht Goetze]] has noticed the specific style of expression. The laws were composed in a mode that facilitated memorizing. A distinguished Israeli scientist and one of the foremost experts on this collection of laws, [[Reuven Yaron]] of the [[University of Jerusalem]] concerning this matter stated: “What matters to me – and might have mattered to those who fashioned them almost 4000 years ago – is the ease of remembering the text.”

The conditional sentence (“If A then B” – as it also is the case with the other [[Mesopotamia]]n laws) is an attribute of this codification. In 23 paragraphs, it appears in the form šumma awilum – “If a man…”  After the disposition, a precise sanction follows, e.g. LU42(A): “If a man bit and severed the nose of a man, one mina silver he shall weigh out.”

The Laws clearly show signs of [[social stratification]], mainly focussing on two different classes: the [[muškenum]] and [[awilum]]. The audience of the Laws of [[Eshnunna]] is more extensive than in the case of the earlier cuneiform codifications: awilum – free men and women (mar awilim and marat awilim), muškenum, wife (aššatum), son (maru), slaves of both sexes – male (wardum) and female (amtum) – which are not only objects of law as in classical slavery, and delicts where the victims were slaves have been sanctioned, and other class designations as ubarum, apþarum, mudum that are not ascertained.

[[Reuven Yaron]] has divided the offences of the Laws of [[Eshnunna]] into five groups. The articles of the first group had to be collected from all over the Laws and the articles of the other four were roughly ordered one after the other:

1. [[Theft]] and related offences,

2. False [[distraint]],

3. [[Sex and the law|Sexual offences]],

4. [[injury|Bodily injuries]],

5. Damages caused by a goring ox and comparable cases.

The majority of these offences were penalized with pecuniary fines (an amount of silver), but some serious offences such as burglary, murder, and sexual offences were penalized with death. It seems that the [[capital punishment]] was avoidable (in contrast to the [[Code of Hammurabi]]), because of the standard formulation: “It is a case of life … he shall die”.

{{Zen Buddhism}}

'''The Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices''' (Chinese: 二入四行; Pinyin: ''èrrú sìxíng''; Wade-Giles: ''Erh-ju ssu-hsing''; Japanese: ''Ninyū shigyō ron'') is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] text attributed to [[Bodhidharma]], the traditional founder of [[Zen|Chan]] (Japanese: [[Zen]]) Buddhism.

==History==

The text, sometimes referred to simply as ''The Two Entrances'', was first used in 6th century CE by a group of wandering monks in Northern China specializing in meditation who looked to Bodhidharma as their spiritual forebearer.  Though this text was originally attributed to Bodhidharma, a great deal of material was added to it, probably around the 8th century, by the monks or perhaps other anonymous groups.  The work, along with T'an Lun's biography of Bodhidharma and other newly discovered manuscripts, was recompiled by a Japanese Zen practitioner, Suzuki Daisetsu, in 1935.

==Teachings==

The '''two entrances''' referred to in the title are the '''entrance of principle''' (理入 lǐrù) and the '''entrance of practice''' (行入 xíngrù).  
* "Entrance of principle" refers to enlightenment through understanding and meditation;
* "Entrance of practice" deals with enlightenment through different daily practices.  In the section on the latter, the '''four practices''' are listed as being at the core of Bodhidharma's teaching.  These are;
** The "practice of retribution of enmity",
** The "practice of acceptance of circumstances",
** The "practice of the absence of craving", 
** The "practice of accordance with the Dharma".

==Structure==

The format of the text is that of a collection of the master's teaching as collected by his students.  There are two entrances listed, one abstract and one concrete.  In other words, the text list two different ways of achieving enlightenment, one based on inward reflection (the entrance of principle) and one based on outward action (the entrance of practice).  The bimodal structure of this treatise was frequently copied and became typical in early Chan Buddhism.

==Biography==
Nguyễn Khản was born in 1734 at [[Tiên Điền]] village, [[Nghi Xuân]] district, [[Đức Quang]] prefect, [[Hà Tĩnh Province|Nghệ An]] region of the [[Revival Lê dynasty]]. He was the first child (of 21 children) of the duke [[Nguyễn Nghiễm]]. Nguyễn Khản was a child of his father's first wife (of 8 women) who has a name Đặng Thị Dương, she was the second daughter of official Đặng Sĩ Vinh&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nguyendu.com.vn/vi/te-tuong-nguyen-khan-AE7A9533B1AA58C386B736963913D625.html Prime Minister Nguyễn Khản]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In his childhood, he studied knowledge. He passed the official government examination as a doctor in 1760 and then became a teacher of the Crown Prince [[Trịnh Tông]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hannom.org.vn/detail.asp?param=1124&amp;Catid=564 List of doctos in the 1760 official government examination]&lt;/ref&gt;. So he changed his name as '''Nguyễn Hân''' (阮欣). In 1767, lord [[Trịnh Sâm]] changed his name as '''Nguyễn Lệ''' (阮儷). In 1778, he re-changed his name as Nguyễn Khản&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vanhoanghean.com.vn/dat-va-nguoi-xu-nghe6/nguoi-xu-nghe43/nguyen-khan-quan-thuong-thu-tai-hoa Nguyễn Khản like the talented minister]&lt;/ref&gt;.

}}
'''Peter Carruthers''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|r|ʌ|ð|ər|z}}; born 16 June 1952) is a British-American [[philosopher]] and [[cognitive scientist]] working primarily in the area of [[philosophy of mind]], though he has also made contributions to philosophy of language and ethics. He is Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], associate member of [http://www.nacs.umd.edu/ Neuroscience and Cognitive Science Program] and member of the [http://carnap.umd.edu/cpas/ Committee for Philosophy and the Sciences.]

==Education==
Before he moved to the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] in 2001, Carruthers was Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]] where he founded and directed the [http://www.philosophy.dept.shef.ac.uk/hangseng/projects/index.php Hang Seng Centre for Cognitive Studies] and prior to that was a lecturer at [[University of Essex]], [[Queen's University of Belfast]], [[University of St. Andrews]], and [[University of Oxford]]. He was educated at the [[University of Leeds]] before studying for his [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil]] at [[University of Oxford]] under [[Michael Dummett]].

==Philosophical work==
Carruthers' primary research interests are in [[philosophy of mind]], [[philosophy of psychology]], and [[cognitive science]]. He has worked especially on theories of consciousness, the role of [[natural language]] in human cognition, and [[modularity of mind]], but has also published on such issues as: the mentality of animals; the nature and status of our [[folk psychology]]; nativism (innateness); human creativity; theories of [[intentional content]]; and defence of a notion of [[narrow content]] for psychological explanation. He is presently working on a book project, tentatively entitled [[Telepathy|Mind-reading]] and [[Meta-cognition]], which examines the cognitive basis of our understanding of the minds of others and its relationship to our access to our own minds.  He has also written a book in applied ethics, arguing that animals do not have moral rights.

===Notable ideas===
;The role of language in cognition
There is a spectrum of opinions on the role of language in cognition. At one extreme, philosophers like [[Michael Dummett]] have argued that thought is impossible in the absence of language; and social scientists influenced by [[Benjamin Whorf]] have believed that the natural languages that people grow up speaking will have a profound influence on the character of their thoughts. At the other extreme, philosophers like [[Jerry Fodor]], together with most cognitive scientists, have believed that language is but an input/output device for cognition, playing no significant role in thought itself. Peter Carruthers has steered a path in between these two extremes. In his 1996 book,&lt;ref&gt;''Language, Thought and Consciousness: an essay in philosophical psychology'' (1996). Cambridge University Press.
[http://www.philosophy.umd.edu/Faculty/pcarruthers/Blurb-LTC.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; he allowed that much thought can and does occur in the absence of language, while arguing for a constitutive role for language in conscious thinking, conducted in "[[inner speech]]". In his 2006 book,&lt;ref name="philosophy.umd.edu"&gt;''The Architecture of the Mind: massive modularity and the flexibility of thought'' (2006). Oxford University Press. [http://www.philosophy.umd.edu/Faculty/pcarruthers/Blurb-AoM.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; this position is broadened and deepened. Following [[Antonio Damasio]], he argues that mental rehearsals of action issue in imagery that plays a profound role in human practical reasoning, with inner speech now being seen as a subset of action rehearsal. Carruthers now argues that the serial use of these rehearsals can issue in a whole new ''level'' of thinking and reasoning, serving to realize the “dual systems” that psychologists like [[Daniel Kahneman]] believe to be involved in human reasoning processes.

;Massive modularity of the human mind
[[Evolutionary psychologist]]s like [[Leda Cosmides]], [[John Tooby]], and [[Steven Pinker]] have claimed that the mind consists of a great many distinct functionally specialized systems, or modules. [[Jerry Fodor]] has argued, in contrast, that the "central" processes of the mind (judging, reasoning, deciding, and so forth) ''cannot'' be modular. In his 2006 book,&lt;ref name="philosophy.umd.edu"/&gt; Peter Carruthers lays out the main case supporting massive modularity, shows how the notion of "module" in this context should properly be understood, and takes up Fodor’s challenge by showing how the distinctive flexibility, creativity, and rationality of the human mind can result from the interactions of massive numbers of modules.

;Dispositional higher-order thought theory of consciousness
Amongst philosophers who think that [[consciousness]] admits of explanation, the most popular approach has been some or other variety of [[representationalism]]. Representationalists hold that the distinctive features of consciousness can be explained by appeal to the representational contents (together with the causal roles) of experience. First-order representationalists like [[Fred Dretske]] and [[Michael Tye (philosopher)]] believe that the relevant contents are world-directed ones (colors, sounds, and so forth) of a distinctive sort (non-conceptual, analog, or fine-grained). Higher-order representationalists like [[William Lycan]], [[David M. Rosenthal (philosopher)|David M. Rosenthal]], and Peter Carruthers, in contrast, maintain that we need to be aware of undergoing these first-order experiences in order for the latter to qualify as conscious. On Carruthers' view, the awareness in question is dispositional. By virtue of an experience being available to higher-order thought, it is claimed to acquire a higher-order non-conceptual content. Hence, conscious experiences have a dual content: while representing the world to us, they also represent themselves to us. Conscious experiences are thus held to be self-representational ones.

;The denial of introspection for thoughts
Most people (philosophers and non-philosophers alike) assume that they have direct introspective access to their own propositional attitude events of judging, deciding, and so forth{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. We think of ourselves as knowing our own thought processes immediately, without having to interpret ourselves (in the way that we ''do'' need to interpret the behavior and circumstances of other people if we are to know what ''they'' are thinking). In a series of [http://www.philosophy.umd.edu/Faculty/pcarruthers/Articles-c.htm recent papers] Peter Carruthers has argued that this introspective intuition is illusory. While allowing that we do have introspective access to our own experiences, including imagistic experiences of the sort that occur during "inner speech", he draws on evidence from across the cognitive sciences to argue that our knowledge of our own judgments and decisions results from us turning our interpretative skills upon ourselves. He also argues that while inner speech plays important roles in human cognition, it never plays the right ''sort'' of role to constitute a judgment, or a decision. The latter processes always occur below the surface of consciousness, Carruthers claims.

The '''Philosophy of Science Association''' ('''PSA''') is an American academic organization which promotes the study and discussion of the [[philosophy of science]].

Founded in 1933, the PSA engages in activities such as the publishing of periodicals, essays and [[monograph]]s in the field of the philosophy of science; sponsoring conventions and meetings; and the awarding of prizes for distinguished work in the field. In 2012, it began presenting the '''Hempel Award''', named for the eminent 20th-century philosopher of science [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], for lifetime achievement in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsci.org/2-uncategorised/221-hempel-award-recipients Hempel Award recipients]&lt;/ref&gt; The first recipient was [[Bas van Fraassen]].

The President during 2015/2016 is [[C. Kenneth Waters]].

'''Dependent designation''' (from {{lang-sa|italic=yes|prajñaptir upādāya}}; {{bo|t=བརྟེན་ནས་གདགས་པ|w=rten ne dag pa}}; {{zh|c=假名|p=jia-ming}}) is an important [[doctrine]] of [[Madhyamika]] [[Buddhism]].

The term was coined (or appeared to be coined) by [[Nagarjuna]] in 24:18 of the [[Mūlamadhyamakakārikā]]. It became important for, and was championed by, the Tibetan followers of [[Candrakirti]].

{{Cquote|
Whatever is [[Pratītyasamutpāda|dependently co-arisen]]&lt;br&gt;
That is explained to be [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]].&lt;br /&gt;
That, being a '''dependent designation''',&lt;br /&gt;
Is itself the [[middle way]].|30px|30px|Nagarjuna, {{IAST|''Mūlamadhyamakakārikā''}} 24:18}}

Dependent designation is one of the 'three dependencies' asserted by the Madhaymikas, the others being [[dependent arising]], which relates to the concept that all existents arise from causes; and dependence upon parts, the idea that all existents are composite. Each of these dependencies are used, separately and together, to help establish an understanding of [[sunyata]], the absence of inherent existence, which is the third of the [[three marks of existence]].

According to the 14th Dalai Lama,

An [[attempt]] to commit an unconsummated crime is viewed as having the same gravity as if the crime had occurred. But preparation that falls short of an actual attempt is not, although it may be punishable in some other way.

Courts have not been able to draw a clear bright line as to when acts committed in preparation for a crime are actually an attempt to commit the crime.

Some approaches, summarized in the case of ''[[United States v. Mandujano]]'', include the [[physical proximity doctrine]], the [[dangerous proximity doctrine]], the [[indispensable element test]], the [[probable desistance test]], the [[abnormal step]] approach, and the [[uneqivocality test]].

The [[Model Penal Code]] approach requires a [[substantial step]], in addition to having a criminal [[purpose]].

{{Close relationships}}
{{Love sidebar}}
'''Public displays of affection''' ('''PDA''') are acts of [[physical intimacy]] in the view of others. What is an acceptable display of [[affection]] varies with respect to culture and context. Displays of affection in a public place, such as the street, are more likely to be objected to, than similar practices in a private place with only people from a similar cultural background present. Some organizations have rules limiting or prohibiting public displays of affection.

Physical affection has been defined as "any touch intended to arouse feelings of love in the giver and/or the recipient."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gulledge|first1=A. K.|last2=Gulledge|first2=M. H.|last3=Stahmann|first3=R. F.|title=Romantic physical affection types and relationship satisfaction|journal=The American Journal of Family Therapy|date=2003|volume=31|issue=4|pages=233–242|doi=10.1080/01926180390201936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convention==
In the United States, "get a room" is a phrase that is usually said when one feels a sense of disapproval after seeing what they consider to be an excessive public display of affection.&lt;ref&gt;The Michigan Journal - Volume 25, Issue 18 - Page 7, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/get-a-room|title=the definition of get a room|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on romantic relationships==
[[File:Bruno Gagliasso e Giovana Ewnbank 002.jpg|thumb|upright|Brazilian actors [[Bruno Gagliasso]] and [[Giovanna Ewbank]], who are married, kiss and hug each other publicly while dancing, 2010.]]

Various studies have found physical affection to be associated with positive outcomes in romantic relationships. For instance, it has been related to the formation of attachment bonds and psychological intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=L. M.|title=Are friends as good as lovers? Attachment, physical affection, and effects on cardiovascular arousal in young women's closest relationships|journal=Dissertation Abstracts International, Section B the Sciences and Engineering|date=2000|volume=60|page=4272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mackey|first1=R. A.|last2=Diemer|first2=M. A.|last3=O'Brien|first3=B. A.|title=Psychological intimacy in the lasting relationships of heterosexual and same-gender couples|journal=Sex Roles|date=2000|volume=43|issue=3/4|pages=201–227|doi=10.1023/A:1007028930658}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical affection has been categorized into seven different types including [[holding hands]], [[cuddling]]/holding, backrubs/massages, [[caressing]]/[[wikt:stroking|stroking]], kissing on the face, [[hugging]], and kissing on the lips.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Five of these behaviors, with the exception of caressing/stroking and holding hands, have been significantly positively associated with relationship and partner satisfaction.

==Social media==

Expression of a person’s feelings towards someone else had previously been limited to written letters, phone calls or in person. In the modern world, [[social media]] sites such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] are growing, with 1.7 billion users on Facebook&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/facebook-statistics/ |website=www.statisticbrain.com |title=Facebook Company Statistics – Statistic Brain|date=2017-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and over half a billion Twitter users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.statisticbrain.com/twitter-statistics/ |website=www.statisticbrain.com |title=STATS {{!}} Twitter Company Statistics – Statistic Brain|date=September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on relationships through Facebook found that, when two individuals who are interested in one another both use Facebook regularly, their relationship progresses in different increments than how it would without social media. After two people meet and form an interest, one or both individuals will go onto the other person’s Facebook page and get information such as [[relationship status]], pictures, and interests. Once a relationship begins, some couples broadcast their relationship with posts, such as pictures and changing the relationship status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=J.|last2=Warber|first2=K. M.|last3=Makstaller|first3=D. C.|title=The role of Facebook in romantic relationship development: An exploration of Knapp's Relational Stage Model|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|date=2013|volume=30|issue=6|pages=771–794|doi=10.1177/0265407512468370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How people show their public displays of affection on social media sites can be indicative of relationship security and [[personality]]. Frequent and recent communication with a romantic partner through different forms of social media is an indicator of relational escalation, whereas limited communication has shown to be an indicator of alienation or relational de-escalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sosik|first1=V. S.|last2=Bazarova|first2=N. N.|title=Relational maintenance on social network sites: How Facebook communication predicts relational escalation.|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=2014|volume=35|pages=124–131|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.02.044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study has shown that when someone focuses on relationship status and public displays of affection such as posting about activities with the [[significant other]] or his or her feelings towards them, that person tends to be more possessive or territorial over their partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowe|first1=G.|title=Reading romance: The impact Facebook rituals can have on a romantic relationship.|journal=Journal of Comparative Research in Anthropology and Sociology|date=2010|volume=1|pages=61–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study found female characters on prime time televisions programs are significantly less likely to demonstrate physical affection if they had a larger body type than thinner female characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenberg|first1=B. S.|last2=Eastin|first2=M.|last3=Hofschire|first3=L.|last4=Lachlan|first4=K.|last5=Brownell|first5=K. D.|title=Portrayals of overweight and obese individuals on commercial television|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=93|issue=8|pages=1342–1348|doi=10.2105/ajph.93.8.1342|pmid=12893625|pmc=1447967|year=2003|citeseerx=10.1.1.530.9981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even television producers act in a way as to intentionally limit public displays of affection based on the appearance of their actors, and that might affect viewership based on social disapproval. Regardless of television portrayals, the frequency and intensity of PDA has a tendency to depend upon the cultural context as well as perceived public perceptions of the couple, including their [[age group]], [[racial composition]], [[sexuality]], and relationship centralized activity on social media.

== Adolescent==

It is well recognized that relationships outside the family become increasingly important during adolescence. Although several studies of basic social processes have been conducted by sociologists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleman|first1=J. S.|title=The Adolescent Society: The Social Life of the Teenager and its Impact on Education.|date=1961|publisher=Greenwood|location=Westport, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waller|first1=W.|title=The rating and dating complex|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=2|issue=5|pages=727–734|doi=10.2307/2083825|jstor=2083825|year=1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; much of the research and theorizing about adolescent relationships has been carried out by developmental psychologists. Much more research has been done in the area of specific adolescent behaviors, which has shown that these behaviors are predicted well by relationship variables to include the display of affection.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giordano|first1=P. C.|last2=Cernkovich|first2=S. A.|last3=Holland|first3=D.|title=Changes in friendship relationships over the life course: Implications for desistance from crime|journal=Criminology|date=2003|volume=41|issue=2|pages=293–328|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.2003.tb00989.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Affection or intimacy references a pattern of conduct within relationships that includes subjective assessments of attachment. This pattern of conduct is a part of a larger constellation of factors that contributes to an adolescent’s development of a non-parental relationship. A number of sociologists have explored the more general terrain of gender relations, although several of the key studies focus on preadolescence and early adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adler|first1=P. A.|last2=Adler|first2=P.|title=Peer Power: Preadolescent Culture and Identity.|date=1998|publisher=Rutgers University|location=New Brunswick, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eder|first1=D.|last2=Evans|first2=C. C.|last3=Parker|first3=S.|title=School Talk: Gender and Adolescent Culture.|date=1995|publisher=Rutgers University|location=New Brunswick, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merten|first1=D. E.|title=Going-with: the role of a social form in early romance|journal=Journal of Contemporary Ethnography|date=1996|volume=24|issue=4|pages=462–484|doi=10.1177/089124196024004004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simon|first1=R. W.|last2=Eder|first2=D.|last3=Evans|first3=C.|title=The development of feeling norms underlying romantic love among adolescent females|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=1992|volume=55|issue=1|pages=29–46|doi=10.2307/2786684|jstor=2786684}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thorne|first1=B.|last2=Luria|first2=Z.|title=. Sexuality and gender in children's daily worlds|journal=Social Problems|date=1986|volume=33|issue=3|pages=176–190|doi=10.1525/sp.1986.33.3.03a00020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work is important in highlighting the degree to which features of these early relations, and even intense personal feelings such as being in love, are socially constructed. Adolescents' conceptions about and conduct within these relationships are heavily influenced by interaction and communication with other girls or other boys.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Specific rules emerge (e.g., one should always be in love, it is wrong to date more than one person, heterosexuality is the only acceptable romantic option) and gossip or other social sanctions serve as important sources of informal social control around these rules.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
 
Research moves into the early adolescent period when youths are old enough to say they are going steady and is useful in actually characterizing the nature of these relationships. These liaisons are described as highly superficial and based on unrealistic idealized expectations. Furthermore, the desire of adolescents to put on a good "front" inhibits the development of intimacy. Going steady is a limiting factor on the adolescent social ritual.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Boys and girls begin the process of relating to one another, the transition is much easier for adolescent males, who essentially transport their dominant interaction styles (derived from peer interactions) into this new relationship form with the opposite sex. Public displays of affection may facilitate the demonstration of this dominant interaction style transference in a socially acceptable way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maccoby|first1=E.|title=Gender and relationships: a developmental account|journal=American Psychologist|date=1990|volume=45|issue=4|pages=513–520|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.45.4.513|pmid=2186679}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental research on communication processes observed in same- and mixed-gender groups to support this idea. Although behavior observed in cross-gender task groups is relevant, intimate dyadic relationships and task groups are not equivalent social contexts. Thus, an alternative hypothesis is that boys, who have less practice than their female counterparts with PDA (by virtue of their peer group experiences), must make a larger developmental leap as they move into the heterosexual arena. For example, examining the messages students write one another in high-school yearbooks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Giordano|first1=P. C.|last2=Longmore|first2=M. A.|last3=Manning|first3=W. D.|title=Sociological Studies of Children and Youth|date=2001|publisher=Elsevier|location=New York, NY|pages=111–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; we observed marked differences between boys' discourse directed toward friends (e.g., "you're a lousy wrestler…") and that directed toward romantic partners (e.g., "you are very beautiful in so many ways, it would take me a lifetime to express them in words…"). In contrast, young girls use of language in messages to close friends and boyfriends is more similar in form and content. To the degree that the romantic context provides their only opportunity to express themselves and, more broadly, to relate in this intimate fashion, young males can be considered more dependent on these relations than female adolescents, who have close friends for intimate talk and social support. Of course, this quality of uniqueness may figure into the etiology of more negative and sometimes gendered relational dynamics that also emerge in connection with romantic involvements stalking, intrusive control efforts, violence and the like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hagan|first1=J.|last2=Foster|first2=H.|title=Youth violence and the end of adolescence|journal=American Sociological Review|date=2001|volume=66|issue=6|pages=874–899|doi=10.2307/3088877|jstor=3088877|citeseerx=10.1.1.515.3673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interracial==

Implicit or explicit attitudes towards [[:wikt:interracial|interracial]] relationships strongly affect interpretations of public displays of affection within this context. These attitudes can be influenced by a plethora of factors, including social contact. For example, personal involvement and extended contact (media representations) with interracial and Black-White relationships has been linked to more positive perspectives regarding interracial relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lienemann|first1=B. A.|last2=Stopp|first2=H. T.|title=The association between media exposure of interracial relationships and attitudes toward interracial relationships.|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=2013|volume=43|pages=398–415|doi=10.1111/jasp.12037 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, personal experience and mere exposure to interracial couples tends to be related to more favorable attitudes. This finding supports the [[contact hypothesis]], which states that if interpersonal interactions between group members of each race will decrease prejudice and foster amicable connections between races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allport|first1=G. W.|title=The nature of prejudice.|date=1954|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the conditions of equal group status, common goals, group cooperation, and social approval, some studies have found other stipulations important for fostering positive relations. For instance, it’s important for the interracial contact to be intimate instead of superficial, for it to happen in many different settings, and for it to happen repeatedly with more than one individual from the other race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackman|first1=M. R.|last2=Crane|first2=M.|title=Some of my best friends are black...: Interracial friendship and whites' racial attitudes|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|date=1986|volume=50|issue=4|pages=459–486|doi=10.1086/268998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pettigrew|first1=T. F.|title=Generalized intergroup contact effects on prejudice|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1997|volume=23|issue=2|pages=173–185|doi=10.1177/0146167297232006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powers|first1=D. A.|last2=Ellison|first2=C. J.|title=Interracial contact and black racial attitudes: The contact hypothesis and selectivity bias|journal=Social Forces|volume=74|pages=205–226|doi=10.1093/sf/74.1.205|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sigelman|first1=L.|last2=Welch|first2=S.|title=The contact hypothesis revisited: Black-white interaction and positive racial attitudes|journal=Social Forces|date=1993|volume=71|issue=3|pages=781–795|doi=10.1093/sf/71.3.781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not everyone, especially those with learned biases and/or [[Racism|racist attitudes]], is likely to be exposed to another race under these exact conditions; this lack of exposure to racial diversity will further perpetuate the internal cycle of unsubstantiated prejudice. In fact, the larger presence of [[African-Americans]], [[Latinos]] and [[Asians]] in neighborhoods and religious congregations significantly predicts higher support from [[White American|Caucasians]] for [[interracial marriages]] with these other races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perry|first1=S. L.|title=Racial composition of social settings, interracial friendship, and whites' attitudes toward interracial marriage.|journal=The Social Science Journal|date=2013|volume=50|pages=13–22|doi=10.1016/j.soscij.2012.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it has been found that higher numbers of individuals from each of these racial groups in these social settings predict more interracial friendships. Therefore, it appears that reducing the socially imposed distance between one’s in-group and out-group can result in developing more favorable attitudes towards romantic relationships between races. The problem still exists though that many people who have negative attitudes towards other races will avoid social settings where they may be exposed to other races due to ingrained [[stereotypes]], opting instead to surround themselves with members of their in-group. In general, one study using survey data found that approximately half of African-American respondents versus about a quarter of Caucasian respondents approve of a close relative marrying an individual of the other race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Djamba|first1=Y. K.|last2=Kimuna|first2=S. R.|title=Are Americans really in favor of interracial marriage? A closer look at when they are asked about Black-White marriage for their relatives|journal=Journal of Black Studies|date=2014|volume=45|issue=6|pages=528–544|doi=10.1177/0021934714541840}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, it appears that the problem is pervasive to the point that there are a large proportion of individuals on both sides of the equation who do not approve of interracial relationships.

Due to perceptions of others’ attitudes towards interracial relationships, many interracial couples may engage in certain behavioral strategies to reduce stigma and ostracism. Research shows that adolescent interracial couples tend to participate in fewer public and private activities than couples composed of individuals from the same race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vaquera|first1=E.|last2=Kao|first2=G.|title=Private and public displays of affection among interracial and intra-racial adolescent couples|journal=Social Science Quarterly|date=2005|volume=86|issue=2|pages=484–508|doi=10.1111/j.0038-4941.2005.00314.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant differences have been found between these two groups on holding hands in public, whereby interracial couples are less likely to do so, yet these differences do not maintain significance in the context of private displays of intimate affection. Therefore, it appears that the fear of being negatively judged in public inhibits interracial couples from displaying physical affection in comparison to couples of the same race. Interracial couples have also been found to engage in other strategies to deter potential judgment, including ignoring public harassment to avoid confrontation, staying at home or filtering their social group to increase acceptance, attending social gatherings attended only by other interracial couples, and publicly surrounding themselves with members of their social support network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Datzman|first1=J.|last2=Gardner|first2=C. B.|title=In My Mind, We Are All Humans|journal=Marriage and Family Review|date=2008|volume=30|pages=5–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, many interracial couples still fear perceptions of public displays of affection, even though increased exposure and contact with other races under harmonious conditions is associated with more favorable attitudes towards interracial relationships. This is made evident in less engagement in these behaviors publicly as well as forms of premeditated coping strategies in response to public harassment. As the research is limited, it is difficult to definitively determine if these behavioral responses are contingent upon the social setting as well as the racial composition of the surrounding public, i.e., would an interracial couple be more likely to engage in public displays of affection in a racially diverse crowd, or a party of friends as opposed to strangers? Moreover, the majority of the extant literature has examined interracial couples composed of African American and Caucasian individuals, neglecting potential differences with different groups of minority interracial groups, e.g., Asian/Latino, African-American/Asian. Therefore, future research should examine the different dynamics of interracial relationships, including individual differences, social status, social setting, socio-economic status, and other psychosocial factors that may contribute to the engagement or avoidance of public displays of affection.

{{See also|Societal attitudes toward homosexuality}}

Public displays of affection between individuals of the same sex may or may not suggest homosexuality depending on the cultural context. For example, in many [[African cultures]] it is socially acceptable for people of the same sex to participate in public displays of affection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Peek|first=Philip M.|title=Twins in African and Diaspora Cultures: Double Trouble, Twice Blessed|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=221|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ag0uduy5bYEC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=homosexual+display+of+affection#v=onepage&amp;q=homosexual%20display%20of%20affection&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0253223074|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in other countries such as the [[United States]] and [[Portugal]], it is considered indicative of homosexuality. Public displays of affection tend to be determined largely by culture which greatly influences perceptions of same-sex PDA.

Intolerance for homosexual PDA is common place in large swaths of society in many different cultures. For instance, in Portugal, [[LGBT]] individuals only act in ways that contend contemporary ideals and political/economic agendas. Homosexual individuals are less likely to partake in public displays of affection because their society is extremely critical of the act. They believe that by behaving according to what society deems appropriate, (e.g., only opposite-sex couples should partake in acts of public displays of affection), they are protecting themselves from being categorized as abnormal, odd, or deviant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Oliveira|first1=J. M.|last2=Costa|first2=C. G.|last3=Nogueira|first3=C.|title=The Workings of Homonormativity: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Queer Discourses on Discrimination and Public Displays of Affections in Portugal|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|date=2013|volume=60|issue=10|pages=1475–1493|doi=10.1080/00918369.2013.819221|pmid=24059969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although same-sex marriage has been legal in Portugal since June 2010 (see [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal]]), LGBT people still refrain from public displays of affection for the most part. This detail may suggest that Portugal’s acceptance of same-sex marriage is due to the fact that the LGBT individuals do not broadcast their sexuality, not that the public of Portugal is more accepting of these acts. Although it may appear that homosexual individuals are ambivalent about being limited in only displaying affection privately, it seems to happen out of fear of resentment or being perceived as odd rather than out of respect for their societies’ political beliefs and attitudes.

There have been many in depth studies regarding [[societal attitudes towards homosexuality]] across many different factors. One study found that heterosexual people had higher negative attitudes towards homosexuals of their own sex, especially if they felt that they were being targets of sexual advances. They also found that men have less negative attitudes towards homosexual females than males whereas women tend to be more accepting overall of homosexuals and their role in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitley|first1=B. E.|title=Sex Differences in Heterosexuals' Attitudes Toward Homosexuals: It Depends Upon What You Ask.|journal=Journal of Sex Research|date=1988|volume=24|issue=1|doi=10.1080/00224498809551426|pmid=22375663|pages=287–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the contemporary Western society, attitudes towards same-sex public displays of affection vary city to city much like they vary country to country. Studies have shown that in populations where the majority of individuals have high cultural values and are more accommodating, same-sex or same gender public displays of affection are more likely to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaines|first1=S. O.|title=Cultural Value Orientations, Internalized Homophobia, and Accommodation in Romantic Relationships|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|date=2005|volume=50|issue=1|pages=97–117|doi=10.1300/j082v50n01_05|pmid=16368666|hdl=1871/17366}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is understandable because same sex individuals feel less persecuted by others in society and are less likely to feel as though they are being categorized as odd, abnormal, or deviant like those in Portugal.
 
Of course, there are negative attitudes towards same-sex or same gender public displays of affection as well. In a [[Colorado]] high school, two yearbook staff resigned after they were informed that they could not print the relationship page because it had a photo of two females holding hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorado High School Controversy|url=http://www.ktvu.com/videos/news/colorado-high-school-controversy-over-gay-pda/vGXNY/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the [[New York City]] Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project declared in 2007 that "people are still verbally harassed and physically attacked daily for engaging in simple displays of affection in public. Everything changes the minute we kiss".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/18/fashion/18affection.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Guy | last=Trebay | title=A Kiss Too Far? | date=February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwide==

===Religiosity===
Religiosity is one important factor that influences how romantic relationships develop in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bearman|first1=P. S.|last2=Bruckner|first2=H.|title=Promising the Future: Virginity Pledges and First Intercourse|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=2001|volume=106|issue=4|pages=859–912|doi=10.1086/320295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher levels of religiosity are not directly related to the number of partners reported by the respondents. However, religious respondents report lower levels of intimate contact with their partners. It is apparent that religiosity influences the level of expression of affection in general. Also, religion is related to more conservative values that may have a global effect on all levels of PDA by younger participants.
Seemingly religiosity may work in two different ways where religious communities are in general quite racially segregated in the around the world, and people with strong religious beliefs may be very unlikely to engage in sexual activity or even to date someone due to the morals advised by their religion. In many regions of the world, religion drives the cultural view on PDA and this sometimes culminates into proscription based on religious rules, for example [[sharia law]]. The conservative Islamic schools of thought, especially [[Salafism]]-oriented ones forbid public displays of affection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Etzioni|first1=Amitai|title=Hot Spots|date=2012|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe and North America===
In most of the [[Western world]], such as [[Europe]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], it is very common to see people holding hands, hugging and sometimes kissing in public. It is not usually socially acceptable to be overly explicit, such as engaging in sexual activities. Kissing is more commonly seen in adult night-life, such as nightclubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Public Displays of Affection Abroad (PDA) - Expat Guide Asia |url=http://www.expatguideasia.com/public-displays-affection-pda |website=Expat Guide Asia |accessdate=10 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524131242/http://www.expatguideasia.com/public-displays-affection-pda |archivedate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We are perplexed because, in our culture, fellatio is always sexual, whereas cheek-kissing among kin never is."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Public display of affection is regarded as unacceptable in [[India]]. Kissing and hugging are taboo. However, same sex physical contact is allowed. Under [[section 294 of the Indian Penal Code]], causing annoyance to others through "obscene acts" is a criminal offence with a punishment of imprisonment up to 3 months or a fine, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Criminal Law - Indian Penal Code,1860 - Section 294 - Obscene acts and songs |url=http://www.indianlawcases.com/Act-Indian.Penal.Code,1860-1742 |website=Indian Law Cases |accessdate=10 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105073053/http://www.indianlawcases.com/Act-Indian.Penal.Code,1860-1742 |archivedate=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because this law does not give explicit definitions of "obscene acts", it is blatantly misused by police and lower courts to harass couples. For example, in 2007, when actor [[Richard Gere]] kissed [[Shilpa Shetty]] in an AIDS awareness event in New Delhi, a warrant for his arrest was issued by an Indian court. People burnt effigies of Gere and Shetty for publicly embracing in a "sexually provocative" way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/features/sunday-magazine/kiss-a-miss-how-much-display-of-public-affection-is-too-much/articleshow/11941266.cms |title=Kiss a miss: How much display of public affection is too much? |journal=The Economic Times|date=2012-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cases of harassment of dating couples are generally bitterly criticized by a growing number of young Indians, who feel the need for a change in the perception on dating and public displays of affection. In the past, attacks by vigilante groups also were a danger for those celebrating Valentine's Day. However the number of couples celebrating Valentine's Day has grown so much that these attacks have become ineffective in deterring couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/4447238/Hindu-extremists-will-attack-Valentines-Day-couples.html | work=Telegraph, UK | title=Hindu extremists 'will attack Valentine's Day couples' |  first=Ben| last=Farmer| date=February 3, 2009 | accessdate=October 16, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, relaxation of previous generations' social norms has made public displays of affection more common among India's younger demographic. In the state of [[Kerala]], a public hugging and kissing campaign (named [[2014 Kiss of Love protest|Kiss Of Love]]) was launched in November 2014 in protest against [[Moral police|moral policing]].&lt;ref name=Toix1&gt;{{cite news|last1=B|first1=Viju|title='Kiss of love' movement: They came, dared the mob, did it|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Kiss-of-love-movement-They-came-dared-the-mob-did-it/articleshow/45016955.cms|accessdate=3 November 2014|publisher=[[The Times of India]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
[[Indonesia]] is the most populous Muslim country in the world. Muslim practices and Islamic traditions have grown stronger over the past few years, and they consider public displays of affections taboo. Heavy or passionate kissing could carry a "maximum penalty of five years in jail or a 250 million rupiah ($29,000 fine)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indonesia bans kissing in public|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-591942/Indonesia-bans-kissing-public.html#axzz2KTlnOAoh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In general, public displays of affection are less prevalent in [[Japan]]. It is typical for Japanese families to bow to each other when greeting or when saying goodbye. In Japanese culture, where shame plays a huge part in motivating behavior, it’s often about trying not to lose face. Because of this, Japanese people care deeply about what others think of them, including friends, coworkers, family members, and even total strangers. Propensity to engage in public display of affection is heavily influenced by the culture and thus it is rare for anything more intimate than hand-holding to occur; kissing goodbye is likely out of the question.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Middle East===
Middle Eastern countries such as [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Jordan]] and [[Egypt]] are predominantly Muslim cultures. Although public displays of affection generally do not fit the local culture and customs, it varies even among these countries. Decency laws do not allow public displays of affection. Penalties can be severe based on the action in different countries. Travelers to Dubai have been sentenced to lengthy jail sentences for kissing in public, according to the U.S. Department of State{{Citation needed|reason=You can't go saying 'According to the US Department of State' and then not include a citation|date=September 2018}}. In 2009 a British couple caught publicly kissing in Dubai was deported following a three-month prison sentence. An unmarried Indian couple, who were in a taxi, was sentenced to one year in prison for hugging and kissing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thriftytraveling.com/going-to-dubai-better-know-the-law/|website=Thrifty Traveling|title=Going to Dubai?

Kissing is considered "an offense to public decency".

In Iran holding hands has become more and more popular especially in big cities and among young generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letsgoiran.com/iran-safety-for-tourists|title=Iran Safety and Security For Tourists|website=Let's Go Iran|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ricardo Rozzi''' (born October 6, 1960, in Santiago) is a [[Chile]]an [[ecology|ecologist]] and [[philosophy|philosopher]] who is professor at the [[University of North Texas]] (UNT) and the [[Universidad de Magallanes]] (UMAG). His research combines both disciplines through the study of the interrelations between the ways of knowing and inhabiting the natural world, proposing a dynamic continuous reciprocal feedback between both domains.&lt;ref&gt;Rozzi, R. 1999. The reciprocal links between evolutionary-ecological sciences and environmental ethics. BioScience 49 (11): 911-921.&lt;/ref&gt; His work at UNT forms a central part of the nation's best program in environmental philosophy (www.phil.unt.edu).

==Conservation and applied environmental philosophy==

In addition to his theoretical work, Rozzi has collaborated with the [[Chilean Ministry of Education]], the Latin American Ecology Schoolyard Program, and has participated in the creation of the [http://www.sendadarwin.cl "Senda Darwin"] Biological Station ([[Chiloé Island]], Chile), the Latin American Network of Ethnobotanical Parks, the [[Omora Ethnobotanical Park]] ([[Puerto Williams]], Chile), and the [[UNESCO]] [[Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve]] at the southern end of the Americas, with the aim of incorporating environmental ethics in the practices of conservation and education in Latin America. Currently, he is the director of the [http://www.chile.unt.edu Subantarctic Biocultural Conservation Program], coordinated by the [[University of North Texas]] in the US, and by the [[Universidad de Magallanes]] and the [http://www.ieb-chile.cl Institute of Ecology and Biodiversity] in Chile. With these institutions, he co-directs a biocultural conservation and "field environmental philosophy" program working in collaboration with the [http://www.cep.unt.edu Center for Environmental Philosophy].

==Biocultural conservation==

As the co-founder of the [[Omora Ethnobotanical Park]] and the leader in the creation of the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve, his academic work has been strongly associated with application and includes a novel focus on "biocultural conservation" and the  "linking of human well-being with the environment." Within this same line of inquiry, Rozzi coined the terms "biocultural ethics" and "field environmental philosophy" to denote his emphasis on applying philosophy to real life situations using direct encounter experiences to enrich both academic formation as well as inform social processes, such as decision-making and ecotourism.&lt;ref&gt;Rozzi, R. J.J. Armesto, J. Gutierrez, F. Massardo, G. Likens et al. 2012. Integrating Ecology and Environmental Ethics: Earth Stewardship in the Southern End of the Americas. BioScience 62(3): 226-236 https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/bio.2012.62.3.4&lt;/ref&gt; For example, based on the discovery of the outstanding diversity of mosses, lichens and liverworts (5% of the world's total) in the Magellanic sub-Antarctic ecoregion, Dr. Ricardo Rozzi and his colleagues has coined the term [[Tourism with a Hand Lens]] to refer to a new speciality tourism being promoted in the Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve. Rozzi has called upon tourism operators to place this narrative into their offering for the region and take advantage of this biodiversity hotspot for non-vascular flora. In turn, Rozzi and the Omora Ethnobotanical Park have metaphorically called these small plant communities the "Miniature Forests of Cape Horn" to help the broader society understand the ecological role played by these tiny, but diverse, abundant and important organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Rozzi, R., J. Armesto, B. Goffinet, W. Buck, F. Massardo, J. Silander, Jr., M.T.K. Arroyo, S. Russell, C.B. Anderson, L. Cavieres &amp; J.B. Callicott (2008). Changing biodiversity conservation lenses: Insights from the subantarctic non-vascular flora of southern South America. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 6:131-137 http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/070020&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and awards==
[[File:UDEM etica ambiental 2012 (8) (1).jpg|thumb|Environmental Ethics workshop in Monterrey University]]
In a recent review of the impact of [[Aldo Leopold]]'s ''The Land Ethic'', his son Carl Leopold termed Rozzi's work "ecological ethics",&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, AC. 2004. Living with the Land Ethic. ''BioScience'' 54: 149-154.&lt;/ref&gt; placing it on its own branch in the "tree-like" genealogy he conceived as the legacy of his father's seminal conservation and environmental philosophy work.

As a prolific writer, Rozzi's academic productivity includes dozens of articles, translations, chapters, and books on multiple topics that range from [[ethnoornithology]] to environmental education and philosophy to conservation. Perhaps his most important influential work is the only Latin American textbook on conservation biology called ''Fundamentos de Conservación Biológica: Perspectivas Latinoamericanas''.&lt;ref&gt;Primack, R., R. Rozzi, P. Feinsinger, R. Dirzo, F. Massardo. 2001. ''Fundamentos de Conservación Biológica: Perspectivas Latinoamericanas''. Fondo de Cultura Económica, México. {{ISBN|968-16-6428-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his achievements in academia and his broader impact in society, Ricardo Rozzi has received numerous regional, national and international honors, including:

'''Robert F. Almeder''' (born December 11, 1939) is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at [[Georgia State University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwphi/12435.html "Faculty Emeriti"], Department of Philosophy, George State University.&lt;/ref&gt; He is known in particular for his work on the [[philosophy of science]], and has also written on the [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]] and [[ethics]]. He is the author of 24 books, including ''The Philosophy of Charles S. Peirce'' (1980), ''Death and Personal Survival'' (1992), ''Harmless Naturalism: The Limits of Science and the Nature of Philosophy'' (1998), ''Human Happiness and Morality'' (2000), and ''Truth and Skepticism'' (2010).

Almeder served as the editor of the ''[[American Philosophical Quarterly]]'' (1998–2003), and co-edited the annual ''Biomedical Ethics Reviews'' (1983–2004). He was the inaugural McCullough Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in New York (2005–2007), where he taught courses on human rights, biomedical ethics and the law.

==Background==
Almeder completed his PhD on "The Metaphysical and Logical Realism of Charles Peirce" at the University of Pennsylvania in 1969. Since then he has been the president of the Charles S. Peirce Society as well as president of the Georgia Philosophical Association. He joined the philosophy faculty at Georgia State University in 1972 as an associate professor, and became a full professor in 1980. He retired in 2005.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

Almeder received the Outstanding Educator of America Award in 1973, and the Georgia State University Alumni Distinguished Professor Award for teaching and research in 1984 and 1995. He was the recipient of a Fulbright Scholarship in 1992 and then again in 2005.&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwphl/philosophy/faculty/PhilosophyRobertAlmeder.html |title="Robert Almeder" |accessdate=2012-01-09 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013080627/http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwphl/philosophy/faculty/PhilosophyRobertAlmeder.html |archivedate=October 13, 2008 |df= }}, Georgia State University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cies.org/stories/s_ralmeder.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia State University instituted a student award in honour of Almeder upon his retirement, the Robert F. Almeder Prize, awarded to the student who writes the best paper at the annual Georgia State Student Philosophy Symposium.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwphl/philosophy/PhilosophyAwards.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on mind==
Almeder was strongly influenced by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Ian Stevenson]], and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.O. Quine]], and subscribes to [[Cartesian dualism]], broadly rejecting [[scientism]] and [[materialism]].  Stevenson's [[reincarnation research]] work on children who claimed to remember past lives convinced Almeder that minds are irreducible to brain states. He has argued in several papers and in his ''Beyond Death: The Evidence for Life After Death'' (1992) that Stevenson's critics, most notably the philosopher [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]], have misunderstood the nature of Stevenson's work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Bache|Bache, Christopher]].  ''Dark Night, Early Dawn: Steps to a Deep Ecology of Mind'', SUNY Press, 2000, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cEL8eWF-vHgC&amp;pg=PA37 pp. 37–40].
*Woodhouse, Mark. ''Paradigm Wars''. Frog Books, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dejmdCWwEHsC&amp;pg=PA144 p. 144ff]. Woodhouse writes that the paradigm war over reincarnation "has pitted Robert Almeder, a nationally distinguished philosopher of science, against Paul Edwards, general editor of the ''Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Almeder's recent book, ''Death and Personal Survival: The Evidence for Life After Death'', contains perhaps the most formidable point-for-point defense of reincarnation against a wide range of criticisms."

==Editorial roles==
Almeder served as the editor of the ''American Philosophical Quarterly'' from 1998–2003, and co-edited the annual ''Biomedical Ethics Reviews'' from 1983 to 2004.  He has also served on several editorial boards, including:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10804">'''Sebastiano Maffettone''' (1948) is [[University Professor]] and [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the [[Political Science]] Department at [[Libera Università Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli|LUISS Guido Carli University]] of Rome, where he teaches [[Political Philosophy]] and Theories of Globalization. He has taught in several Italian universities ([[University of Turin|Turin]], [[University of Palermo|Palermo]], [[University of Naples|Naples]] and [[Libera Università Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli|Rome]]) as well as International universities ([[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], [[Boston College]], [[Tufts University]], [[University of Paris|Paris]], [[Delhi University|Delhi]], [[University of Pennsylvania]] to mention a few). Maffettone graduated [[summa cum laude]] from the University of Naples in 1970, and he completed his graduate studies in [[social philosophy]] LSE in 1976, under the supervision of philosophers such as [[Karl Popper]] and [[Amartya K. Sen]].

==Early Work==
In the late ‘70s, Maffettone translated into Italian ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', the work of the American [[philosopher]] [[John Rawls]], whose influence defined the focus of Maffettone’s philosophical approach. Rawls’s liberal perspective and the liberal approach on social and political issues became the milestone of his lifelong research.

Committed to bringing Rawls’s innovative thought to Europe, Maffettone begun to be widely known for his active participation in the academic life, earning the merit of having introduced important scientific novelties, especially in the Italian cultural debate. Besides his growing academic production, Maffettone started to contribute to the public debate through collaborations with major Italian newspapers such as Corriere della Sera, Il Mattino, Il Messaggero, Il Sole24ore and magazines such as [[Panorama (magazine)|Panorama]], [[L’Espresso]], and Reset. For his commitment in the current public debate, Maffettone is considered a public intellectual.

He has also founded and edited philosophy journals (''Notizie di Politeia'' and ''Filosofia e questioni pubbliche'') and research centers (Centro per la Ricerca e lo Studio dei Diritti Umani and Center for Ethics and Global Politics), published scholarly articles on different subjects, and contributed to the public debate on various cultural issues thanks to a wide network of international relationships, participation in seminars, workshops and conferences in Italy and abroad.

One of Maffettone’s contributions to the Italian academy probably is the creation of the Società italiana di filosofia politica (the Italian Society of Political Philosophy). Under his presidency, the society became a point of reference for the Italian political philosophers, and the political life of the country.

==Main works==
Maffettone is author of 16 volumes, many of which have deeply influenced European scientific community. Two of his books, ''Il valore della vita'' (1998), and ''Etica pubblica'' (2001) bridge the gap between [[applied ethics]] and political theory, which represents a recurrent theme of Maffettone’s philosophical project. ''Il valore della vita'' presents a rationalist and liberal Lebenphilosophie. Its basic underpinnings come from [[bioethics]], but go beyond this and propose a non-religious, comprehensive theory of life. ''Etica pubblica'' grounds a public understanding of ethics, which the author brought to the attention of the Italian public. The most widely read and criticized chapters were those on [[business ethics]]. It is worth noting how, in the case of both these books, theoretical and practical experiences have found a felicitous convergence.

Together with [[Ronald Dworkin]], Maffettone published ''I fondamenti del liberalismo'' (2008) in which the two authors present their views of liberalism, agreeing in some areas and diverging on others, to begin with the relationship between ethics and politics. This book opened an important critical discussion on liberalism in Italy, which is still ongoing these very days.

Recently, the most importance evidence of his intellectual achievements can be seen in his book ''La pensabilità del mondo'' (2006, the English version is forthcoming), where he presents an original theory within the field of ethics of [[international relations]]. Maffettone’s view is based on the idea of “pluralistic integration”, which tries to represent an alternative to [[cosmopolitanism]]. The core idea is that liberalism and [[democracy]] cannot be imposed from the outside but must come from inside a culture or a nation. The same kind of argument was cashed out in two articles in English, one on the European model of “normative regionalism” (published in “[[The Monist]]”), the other on global justice (forthcoming in the collective [[UNESCO]] volume, edited by [[Thomas Pogge]]).

Among his last publications, there is a solid and comprehensive introduction to the thought of John Rawls (Rawls: An Introduction, Polity Press 2010). In this work, Maffettone interprets Rawls along three hermeneutical hypotheses: the interpretive hypothesis; the methodological hypothesis; and the theoretical hypothesis.
The interpretive hypothesis concerns the much-debated question of the continuity or discontinuity between Rawls 1 (1950–80) and Rawls 2 (1980–2002). Prima facie, discontinuity seems to prevail, given that Rawls’ main books discuss three different subjects: ''A Theory of Justice'' deals with social justice; ''[[Political Liberalism]]'' deals with the main flaws of ''A Theory of Justice'' as well as with political legitimacy; ''[[The Law of Peoples]]'' extends and modifies the previous model in the light of [[global justice]]. However, after reflection one can detect a substantial continuity. Of course, there are significant partial discontinuities, like the ones Rawls enjoins with regard to rational choice theory and, more relevantly, with regard to some passages within the third part of ''A Theory of Justice'' concerning stability.
The methodological hypothesis is designed to complement the interpretive hypothesis by presenting a unitary thread through which we can trigger the desired continuity in our reading of Rawls. This thread follows the basic device Rawls never abandoned, namely the ‘priority of the right’. 
The theoretical hypothesis is based on the idea that the asymmetry between the right and the good depends on a deeper dialectics between justification and [[legitimation]]. According to this distinction, justification looks for the best theoretical argument, is intrinsically substantive, goes top-down and is rooted in the moral and metaphysical bases of a specific culture. Legitimation, on the other hand, is normally based on an institutional practice, concerns mainly the inputs of a political process, goes bottom- up and does not directly appeal to the moral and metaphysical roots of a culture.
Maffettone claims that justification and legitimation must be seen as complementary. Assuming the fact of pluralism in contemporary liberal-democratic societies, we can have different plausible justifications in reciprocal conflict, but we have to rely on the same institutional legitimation for the sake of stability (for the right reasons).

==Main contribution to the Italian debate==

Regarding bioethics, Maffettone was a member of what was probably the first Italian ethical commission in a hospital, under the direction of [[Umberto Veronesi]] (with whom Maffettone continues to work in these years) at the Istituto Tumori, based in Milan.

Maffettone also formulated the theoretical outline of business ethics, which is perhaps the most important Italian deontological code; moreover, he wrote many other codes and formulated other social budgets – among which the one proposed to [[Confindustria]] in 1992 in an extremely delicate political and social moment for Italy.

Maffettone’s synthesis of theoretical reflections and practical applications can be tracked also in his participation to the scientific commissions of influential cultural foundations (like the Fondazione Adriano Olivetti and the Fondazione Einaudi in Rome), and as a consultant on applied-science issues for institutions such as [[ENEA (Italy)|ENEA]], CISPEL and [[MIUR]].

Maffettone is most certainly among the Italian scholars with the strongest connections with foreign academic and scientific institutions. Several times he has been awarded a visiting professorship in the most prestigious American Universities (such as Harvard, [[NYU]], Columbia, Tufts, Boston College). He was also a [[Senior Fellow]] “Ethics and Professions” program  at Harvard University, and visiting professor in France (in the Maison des Sciences de l’Homme and at [[Sciences-Po]] in Paris), as well as in England (LSE) and in India. He has held lectures and courses in more than forty countries (just in the last two years in China, India, France, Great Britain, the United States, and Austria, to name a few), and he took part in many international conferences, publishing his contributions in the conference proceedings.

Maffettone’s commitment to promote research programs with an international relevance is lastly manifest in creation of a doctoral program in Political Theory at [[LUISS]], one of the first program taught in English, which sees the participation of many worldwide recognized scholars.

'''Self-control''', an aspect of [[inhibitory control]], is the ability to regulate one's emotions, thoughts, and [[behavior]] in the face of temptations and impulses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/the-nurture-versus-biosocial-debate-in-criminology/n11.xml | title=Chapter 10: Low Self-Control Is a Brain-Based Disorder | publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd | accessdate=4 May 2014 | author=Matt DeLisi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Executive functions"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Diamond A | title = Executive functions | journal = Annu Rev Psychol | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 135–168 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23020641 | pmc = 4084861 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143750 | quote = Core EFs are inhibition [response inhibition (self-control—resisting temptations and resisting acting impulsively) and interference control (selective attention and cognitive inhibition)], working memory, and cognitive flexibility (including creatively thinking “outside the box,” seeing anything from different perspectives, and quickly and flexibly adapting to changed circumstances).&amp;nbsp;... Self-control is the aspect of inhibitory control that involves control over one’s behavior and control over one’s emotions in the service of controlling one’s behavior.
See 2nd Nephi 2:27 Self-control is about resisting temptations and not acting impulsively. The temptation resisted might be to indulge in pleasures when one should not (e.g., to indulge in a romantic fling if you are married or to eat sweets if you are trying to lose weight), to overindulge, or to stray from the straight and narrow (e.g., to cheat or steal). Or the temptation might be to impulsively react (e.g., reflexively striking back at someone who has hurt your feelings) or to do or take what you want without regard for social norms (e.g., butting in line or grabbing another child’s toy).&lt;br /&gt;Another aspect of self-control is having the discipline to stay on task despite distractions and completing a task despite temptations to give up, to move on to more interesting work, or to have a good time instead. This involves making yourself do something or keep at something though you would rather be doing something else. It is related to the final aspect of self-control—delaying gratification (Mischel et al. 1989)—making yourself forgo an immediate pleasure for a greater reward later (often termed delay discounting by neuroscientists and learning theorists; Louie &amp; Glimcher 2010, Rachlin et al. 1991). Without the discipline to complete what one started and delay gratification, no one would ever complete a long, time-consuming task such as writing a dissertation, running a marathon, or starting a new business.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[executive function]], self-control is a cognitive process that is necessary for regulating one's behavior in order to achieve specific [[goal]]s.&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Timpano  |first1=K.

A related concept in [[psychology]] is [[emotional self-regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burman| first1 = J. T. | last2 = Green | first2 = C.

According to studies, self-regulation, whether emotional or behavioral, was proven to be a limited resource which functions like energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeWall|first=C.

(Muraven, M., Baumeister, R. F., &amp; Tice, D. M.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-control is also a key concept in the [[General Theory of Crime|general theory of crime]], a major theory in [[criminology]]. The theory was developed by [[Michael R. Gottfredson|Michael Gottfredson]] and [[Travis Hirschi]] in their book titled ''A General Theory of Crime'', published in 1990. Gottfredson and Hirschi define self-control as the differential tendency of individuals to avoid criminal acts independent of the situations in which they find themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A General Theory of Crime|last=Gottfredson|first=Michael|last2=Hirschi|first2=Travis|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with low self-control tend to be impulsive, insensitive towards others, risk takers, short-sighted, and nonverbal. The general theory of crime holds that self-control is established in early childhood through three major factors: the strength of the parent-to-child emotional bond, adequate supervision by parents, parents' ability to recognize punishable behavior, and appropriate discipline by parents.

==Research==

===Counteractive===

Desire is an affectively charged motivation toward a certain object, person, or activity, but not limited to, that associated with pleasure or relief from displeasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kavanagh |first1= D.J. |last2= Andrade |first2= J. |last3=May |first3=J. |title= Imaginary relish and exquisite torture: The elaborated intrusion theory of desire |journal= Psychological Review |year=2005 |volume=112 |issue= 2 |pages= 446–467 |doi= 10.1037/0033-295x.112.2.446 |pmid= 15783293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desires vary in strength and duration. A desire becomes a temptation when it impacts or enters the individual's area of self-control, if the behavior resulting from the desire conflicts with an individual’s values or other self-regulatory goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hofmann |first1=W. |last2=Baumeister |first2=R.F. |last3=Forster |first3=G. |last4= Vohs |first4=K.D. |title= Everyday temptations: An experience sampling study on desire, conflict, and self-control |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=2012 |volume= 102 |issue=6 |pages= 1318–1335 |doi= 10.1037/a0026545 |pmid= 22149456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hofmann |first1= W. |last2= Van Dillen |first2= L. |year=2012 |title= Desire: The new hot spot in self-control research |url = |journal= Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume= 21 |issue=5 |pages= 317–322 |doi= 10.1177/0963721412453587 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A limitation to research on desire is the issue of individuals desiring different things. New research looked at what people desire in real world settings. Over one week, 7,827 self-reports of desires were collected and indicated significant differences in desire frequency and strength, degree of conflict between desires and other goals, and the likelihood of resisting desire and success of the resistance. The most common and strongly experienced desires are those related to bodily needs like eating, drinking, and sleeping.&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofmann|first1=W.|last2=Vohs |first2= K.D. |last3=Baumeister |first3= R.F. |title=What people desire, feel conflicted about, and try to resist in everyday life|journal=Psychological Science|year=2012|volume=23|issue=6|pages=582–588|doi=10.1177/0956797612437426|pmid=22547657}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study has many implications related to self-control and the everyday things that interfere with people’s ability to stay on task. This is a big reason why self-control is considered to be a public speaker's worst nightmare.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, Daniel (1998). "Working with Emotional Intelligence", p. 73. Bantam Books, New York.  {{ISBN|0553378589}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Desires that conflict with overarching goals or values are known as temptations.&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofmann | first1 = W. | last2 = Baumesiter | first2 = R.F. | last3 = Forster | first3 = G. | last4 = Vohs | first4 = K.D. | year = 2012 | title = Everyday temptations: An experience sampling study of desire, conflict, and self-control | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 102 | issue = 6| pages = 1318–1335 | doi=10.1037/a0026545| pmid = 22149456 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-control dilemmas occur when long-term goals and values clash with short-term temptations. Counteractive Self-Control Theory states that when presented with such a dilemma, we lessen the significance of the instant rewards while momentarily increasing the importance of our overall values. When asked to rate the perceived appeal of different snacks before making a decision, people valued health bars over chocolate bars. However, when asked to do the rankings after having chosen a snack, there was no significant difference of appeal. Further, when college students completed a questionnaire prior to their course registration deadline, they ranked leisure activities as less important and enjoyable than when they filled out the survey after the deadline passed. The stronger and more available the temptation is, the harsher the devaluation will be.&lt;ref name="Myrseth, K. O. R. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Myrseth | first1 = K. O. R. | last2 = Fishbach | first2 = A. | last3 = Trope | first3 = Y. | year = 2009 | title = Counteractive self-control: When making temptation available makes temptation less tempting | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 159–163 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02268.x | pmid = 19170939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fishbach, A. 2008 pp. 281-294"&gt;Fishbach, A., &amp; Trope, Y (2008). Implicit and explicit counteractive self-control. In J.Y. Shah, W.L. Gardner (Eds.). Handbook of motivation science (pp. 281-294). New York, NY US: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most common self-control dilemmas involves the desire for unhealthy or unneeded food consumption versus the desire to maintain long-term health. An indication of unneeded food could also be over expenditure on certain types of consumption such as eating away from home. Not knowing how much to spend, or overspending one’s budget on eating out can be an symptom of a lack of self control.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, A. (2017). Self-Rationing Efficiency of Repeated Eating-Out Expenses: Does Experience Matter?. Journal of Hospitality &amp; Tourism Research, 41(3), 259-277.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiment participants rated a new snack as significantly less healthy when it was described as very tasty compared to when they heard it was just slightly tasty. Without knowing anything else about a food, the mere suggestion of good taste triggers counteractive self-control and prompted them to devalue the temptation in the name of health. Further, when presented with the strong temptation of one large bowl of chips, participants both perceived the chips to be higher in calories and ate less of them than did participants who faced the weak temptation of three smaller chip bowls, even though both conditions represented the same amount of chips overall. Weak temptations are falsely perceived to be less unhealthy, so self-control is not triggered and desirable actions are more often engaged in, supporting the counteractive self-control theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kroese | first1 = M.F. | last2 = Evers | first2 = C. | last3 = de Ridder | first3 = T.D. | year = 2013 | title = If it's good it must be bad: The indirect effect of temptation strength on self-control through perceived unhealthiness | url = | journal = Eating Behaviors | volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = 522–524 | doi=10.1016/j.eatbeh.2013.07.006| pmid = 24183149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Weak temptations present more of a challenge to overcome than strong temptations, because they appear less likely to compromise long-term values.&lt;ref name="Myrseth, K. O. R. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fishbach, A. 2008 pp. 281-294"/&gt;

===Satiation===
The decrease in an individual's liking of and desire for a substance following repeated consumption of that substance is known as satiation. Satiation rates when eating depend on interactions of trait self-control and healthiness of the food. After eating equal amounts of either clearly healthy (raisins and peanuts) or unhealthy (M&amp;Ms and Skittles) snack foods, people who scored higher on trait self-control tests reported feeling significantly less desire to eat more of the unhealthy foods than they did the healthy foods. Those with low trait self-control satiated at the same pace regardless of health value. Further, when reading a description emphasizing the sweet flavor of their snack, participants with higher trait self-control reported a decrease in desire faster than they did after hearing a description of the healthy benefits of their snack. Once again, those with low self-control satiated at the same rate regardless of health condition. Perceived unhealthiness of the food alone, regardless of actual health level, relates to faster satiation, but only for people with high trait self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Redden | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Haws | first2 = K.L. | year = 2013 | title = Healthy satiation: The role of decreasing desire in effective self-control | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 39 | issue = 5| pages = 1100–1114 | doi=10.1086/667362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construal levels===
Thinking that is characterized by high [[construals]], whenever individuals "are obliged to infer additional details of content, context, or meaning in the actions and outcomes that unfold around them",&lt;ref name = Ross&gt;Ross, L. (1987). The Problem of Construal in Social Inference and Social Psychology. In N. Grunberg, R.E. Nisbett, J. Singer (eds), ''A Distinctive Approach to psychological research: the influence of Stanley Schacter''. Hillsdale, NJ: Earlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; will view goals and values in a global, abstract sense.  Whereas low level construals emphasize concrete, definitive ideas and categorizations. Different construal levels determine our activation of self-control in response to temptations. One technique for inducing high-level construals is asking an individual a series of "why?" questions that will lead to increasingly abstracted responses, whereas low-level construals are induced by "how?" questions leading to increasingly concrete answers. When taking an [[Implicit Association Test]], people with induced high-level construals are significantly faster at associating temptations (such as candy bars) with "bad," and healthy choices (such as apples) with "good" than those in the low-level condition.  Further, higher-level construals also show a significantly increased likelihood of choosing an apple for snack over a candy bar. Without any conscious or active self-control efforts, temptations can be dampened by merely inducing high-level construals. It is suggested that the abstraction of high-level construals reminds people of their overall, lifelong values, such as a healthy lifestyle, which deemphasizes the current tempting situation.&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fujita | first1 = K. | last2 = Han | first2 = H. | year = 2009 | title = Moving Beyond Deliberative Control of Impulses: The Effect of Construal Levels on Evaluative Associations in Self-Control Conflicts | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = 7| pages = 799–804 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02372.x | pmid = 19493322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human and non-human===
Positive correlation between [[language|linguistic capability]] and self-control has been inferred from experiments with [[common chimpanzee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Boysen ST |author2=Berntson GG |title=Responses to quantity: perceptual versus cognitive mechanisms in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) |journal=Journal of experimental psychology. Animal behavior processes |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=82–6 |year=1995 |pmid=7844508 |doi=10.1037/0097-7403.21.1.82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Beran MJ |author2=Savage-Rumbaugh ES |author3=Pate JL |author4=Rumbaugh DM |title=Delay of gratification in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) |journal=Developmental Psychobiology |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=119–276 |year=1999 |pmid=10086230 |doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-2302(199903)34:2&lt;119::aid-dev5&gt;3.0.co;2-p}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human self-control research is typically  modeled by using a [[token economy]] system. A token economy system is a behavioral program in which individuals in a group can earn tokens for a variety of desirable behaviors and can cash in the tokens for various backup, [[positive reinforcer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Martin G. |author2=Pear J.  |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2011 | title = Behavior modification: What it is and how to do it| page = 305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in research methodologies with humans - using tokens or conditioned reinforcers versus non-humans using sub-primary forces suggested procedural artifacts as a possible suspect. One aspect of these procedural differences was the delay to the exchange period (Hyten et al. 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hyten C., Madden G. J., Field D. P. | year = 1994 | title = Exchange delays and impulsive choice in adult humans | journal = Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior | volume = 62 | issue = 2| pages = 225–233 | doi=10.1901/jeab.1994.62-225| pmid = 7964366 | last2 = Madden | last3 = Field | pmc=1334459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-human subjects can and most likely would access their reinforcement immediately. The human subjects had to wait for an "exchange period" in which they could exchange their tokens for money, usually at the end of the experiment. When this was done with the non-human subjects, in the form of pigeons, they responded much like humans in that males showed much less control than females.  (Jackson &amp; Hackenberg 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jackson K., Hackenberg T. D. | year = 1996 | title = Token reinforcement, choice, and self-control in pigeons | url = | journal = Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior | volume = 66 | issue = 1| pages = 29–49 | doi=10.1901/jeab.1996.66-29| pmid = 8755699 | pmc = 1284552 | last2 = Hackenberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Logue, (1995), who is discussed more below, points out that in her study done on self-control it was male children who responded with less self-control than female children.  She then states, that in adulthood, for the most part, the sexes equalize on their ability to exhibit self-control. This could imply a human's ability to exert more self-control as they mature and become aware of the consequences associated with impulsivity. This suggestion is further examined below.

Most of the research in the field of self-control assumes that self-control is in general better than [[impulsiveness]]. As a result, almost all research done on this topic is from this standpoint and very rarely is impulsiveness the more adaptive response in experimental design.

Self-control is a measurable variable in humans. In the worst circumstances people with the most or high self-control and resilience have the best odds of defying the odds they are faced with, which could be poverty, bad schooling, unsafe communities, etc. Those at a disadvantage with high self-control go on to higher education and professional jobs, but this seems to have a negative effect on their health.

When looking at people who come from advantage backgrounds with high self-control, we see a different phenomenon happening. Those who come from an advantaged background tend to be high-achieving and with their achievement comes good health. The psychological phenomenon known as “[[John Henryism]]” posits that when goal-oriented, success-minded people strive ceaselessly in the absence of adequate support and resources, they can—like the mighty 19th-century folk legend who fell dead of an aneurysm after besting a steam-powered drill in a railroad-spike-driving competition—work themselves to death. Or, at least, toward it. In the 1980s Sherman James a socio-epidemiologist from North Carolina found that black Americans in the state suffered disproportionately from heart disease and strokes. He too landed on "John Henryism" as the cause of this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamblin|first1=James|title=The Paradox of Effort|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/07/the-health-cost-of-upward-mobility/398486/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently some in the field of developmental psychology have begun to think of self-control in a more complicated way that takes into account that sometimes impulsiveness is the more adaptive response. In their view, a normal individual should have the capacity to be either impulsive or controlled depending on which is the most adaptive. However, this is a recent shift in paradigm and there is little research conducted along these lines.&lt;ref name="Logue1995"&gt;Logue, A.W. (1995).  Self-Control: Waiting Until Tomorrow For What You Want Today.  Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skinner's survey of techniques ==

[[B.F. Skinner]]'s ''Science and Human Behavior'' provides a survey of nine categories of self-control methods.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical restraint and physical aid ===

The manipulation of the environment to make some responses easier to physically execute and others more difficult illustrate this principle. This can be referred to as physical guidance which is the application of physical contact to induce an individual to go through the motions of a desired behavior. This concept can also be referred to as a physical prompt.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Martin G. |author2=Pear J.  |last-author-amp=yes | year =2011 | title= Behavior modification: What it is and how to do it| page=305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include clapping one’s hand over one’s own mouth, placing one’s hand in one’s pocket to prevent fidgeting, and using a ‘bridge’ hand position to steady a pool shot all represent physical methods to affect behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changing the stimulus ===

Manipulating the occasion for behavior may change behavior as well. Removing distractions that induce undesired actions or adding a prompt to induce it are examples. Hiding temptation and reminders are two more.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; The need to hide temptation is a result of its effect on the mind. A common theme among studies of desire is an investigation of the underlying cognitive processes of a craving for an addictive substance, such as nicotine or alcohol. In order to better understand the cognitive processes involved, the Elaborated Intrusion (EI) theory of craving was developed. According to the EI theory, craving persists because individuals develop mental images of the coveted substance that are instantly pleasurable, but which also increase their awareness of deficit.&lt;ref name="May 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=May |first=Jon |last2=Andrade |first2=Jackie |last3=Panabokke |first3=Nathalie |last4=Kavanagh |first4=David |title=Images of desire: Cognitive models of craving |journal=Memory |date=July 2004 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=447–461 |doi=10.1080/09658210444000061 |pmid=15493072}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hofmann |first=W. |last2=Van Dillen |first2=L. |title=Desire: The New Hot Spot in Self-Control Research |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |year=2012 |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=317–322 |doi=10.1177/0963721412453587}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a cruel circle of desire, imagery, and preparation to satisfy the desire. This quickly escalates into greater expression of the imagery that incorporates working memory, interferes with performance on simultaneous cognitive tasks, and strengthens the emotional response. Essentially the mind is consumed by the craving for a desired substance, and this craving in turn interrupts any concurrent cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name="May 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt; Obviously a craving for nicotine or alcohol is an extreme case, but nevertheless the EI theory holds true for more normal motivations and desires.

=== Depriving and satiating ===
Deprivation is the time in which an individual does not receive a reinforcer, while satiation occurs when an individual has received a reinforcer to such a degree that it will temporarily have no reinforcing power over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Martin G. |author2=Pear J.  |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2011 | title = Behavior modification: What it is and how to do it | page = 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If we deprive ourselves of a stimulus, the value of that reinforcement increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | author = O'Donohue, W., Ferguson, e. K., | year = 2001| title = The Psychology of BF Skinner | page = 174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if an individual has been deprived of food, they may go to extreme measures to get that food, such as stealing. On the other hand, when we have an exceeding amount of a reinforcer, that reinforcement loses its value; if an individual eats a large meal, they may no longer be enticed by the reinforcement of dessert.

One may manipulate one's own behavior by affecting states of deprivation or satiation. By skipping a meal before a free dinner one may more effectively capitalize on the free meal. By eating a healthy snack beforehand the temptation to eat free "junk food" is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

Also noteworthy is the importance of imagery in desire cognition during a state of deprivation. A study conducted on this topic involved smokers divided into two groups. The control group was instructed to continue smoking as usual until they arrived at the laboratory, where they were then asked to read a multisensory neutral script, meaning it was not related to a craving for nicotine. The experimental group, however, was asked to abstain from smoking before coming to the laboratory in order to induce craving and upon their arrival were told to read a multisensory urge-induction script intended to intensify their nicotine craving.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kavanagh 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kavanagh|first=David J.|author2=Andrade, Jackie |author3=May, Jon |title=Imaginary Relish and Exquisite Torture: The Elaborated Intrusion Theory of Desire|journal=Psychological Review|year=2005|volume=112|issue=2|pages=446–467|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.112.2.446|pmid=15783293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the participants finished reading the script they rated their craving for cigarettes. Next they formulated visual or auditory images when prompted with verbal cues such as "a game of tennis" or "a telephone ringing." After this task the participants again rated their craving for cigarettes. The study found that the craving experienced by the abstaining smokers was decreased to the control group's level by visual imagery but not by auditory imagery alone.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kavanagh 2005" /&gt; That mental imagery served to reduce the level of craving in smokers illustrates that it can be used as a method of self-control during times of deprivation.

=== Manipulating emotional conditions ===

We manipulate emotional conditions in order to induce certain ways of responding.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{ cite book | author = O'Donohue, W., Ferguson. E. K., | year = 2001 | title= The Psychology of BF Skinner| page=305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this can be seen in theatre. Actors often elicit tears from painful memories if it is necessary for the character they are playing. This idea is similar to the notion if we read a letter, book, listen to music, watch a movie, in order to get us in the "mood" so we can be in the proper state of mind for a certain event or function.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Additionally, treating an activity as "work" or "fun" can have an effect on the difficulty of self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/656576 |title=Work or Fun? How Task Construal and Completion Influence Regulatory Behavior |year=2011 |last1=Laran |first1=Juliano |last2=Janiszewski |first2=Chris |journal=The Journal of Consumer Research |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=967–983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to analyze the possible effects of the cognitive transformation of an object on desire, a study was conducted based on a well-known German chocolate product. The study involved 71 undergraduate students, all of whom were familiar with the chocolate product. The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the control condition, the consummatory condition, and the nonconsummatory transformation condition.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hofmann |first1=Wilhelm |last2=Deutsch |first2=Roland |last3=Lancaster |first3=Katie |last4= Banaji |first4=Mahzarin R. |title=Cooling the heat of temptation: Mental self-control and the automatic evaluation of tempting stimuli |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |year=2010 |issue=40 |pages=17–25 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each group was then given three minutes to complete their assigned task. The participants in the control condition were told to read a neutral article about a location in South America that was devoid of any words associated with food consumption. Those in the consummatory condition were instructed to imagine as clearly as possible how consuming the chocolate would taste and feel. The participants in the nonconsummatory transformation condition were told to imagine as clearly as possible odd settings or uses for the chocolate. Next, all the participants underwent a manipulation task that required them to rate their mood on a five-point scale in response to ten items they viewed. Following the manipulation task, participants completed automatic evaluations that measured their reaction time to six different images of the chocolate, each of which was paired with a positive or a negative stimuli. The results showed that the participants instructed to imagine the consumption of the chocolate demonstrated higher automatic evaluations toward the chocolate than did the participants told to imagine odd settings or uses for the chocolate, and participants in the control condition fell in-between the two experimental conditions.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2010" /&gt; This indicates that the manner in which one considers an item influences how much it is desired.

=== Using aversive stimulation ===

Aversive stimulation is used as a means of increasing or decreasing the likelihood of target behavior.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Similar to all methods of self-management,  there is a controlling response, and a controlled response. An averse stimuli is sometimes referred to as a punisher or simply an aversive.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Closely related to the idea of a punisher is the concept of punishment. Punishment is the idea that in a given situation, someone does something that is immediately followed by a punisher, then that person is less likely to do the same thing again when she or he next encounters a similar situation. An example of this can be seen when a teenage stays out past curfew. After staying out past curfew the teenagers parents ground the teenager. Because the teenager has been punished for his or her behavior he or she is less likely to stay out past their curfew again, thus decreasing the likelihood of the target behavior.

=== Drugs ===

Certain types of drugs affect self-controls. Stimulants, such as [[methylphenidate]] and [[amphetamine]], improve [[inhibitory control]] in general and are used to treat ADHD.&lt;ref name="Unambiguous PFC D1 A2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spencer RC, Devilbiss DM, Berridge CW | title = The Cognition-Enhancing Effects of Psychostimulants Involve Direct Action in the Prefrontal Cortex | journal = Biol. Psychiatry | volume = 77 | issue = 11 | pages = 940–950 | year = June 2015 | pmid = 25499957 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.09.013 | quote = The procognitive actions of psychostimulants are only associated with low doses. Surprisingly, despite nearly 80 years of clinical use, the neurobiology of the procognitive actions of psychostimulants has only recently been systematically investigated. Findings from this research unambiguously demonstrate that the cognition-enhancing effects of psychostimulants involve the preferential elevation of catecholamines in the PFC and the subsequent activation of norepinephrine α2 and dopamine D1 receptors.&amp;nbsp;... This differential modulation of PFC-dependent processes across dose appears to be associated with the differential involvement of noradrenergic α2 versus α1 receptors. Collectively, this evidence indicates that at low, clinically relevant doses, psychostimulants are devoid of the behavioral and neurochemical actions that define this class of drugs and instead act largely as cognitive enhancers (improving PFC-dependent function). This information has potentially important clinical implications as well as relevance for public health policy regarding the widespread clinical use of psychostimulants and for the development of novel pharmacologic treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and other conditions associated with PFC dysregulation.&amp;nbsp;... In particular, in both animals and humans, lower doses maximally improve performance in tests of working memory and response inhibition, whereas maximal suppression of overt behavior and facilitation of attentional processes occurs at higher doses. | pmc=4377121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cognitive and motivational effects"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ilieva IP, Hook CJ, Farah MJ | title = Prescription Stimulants' Effects on Healthy Inhibitory Control, Working Memory, and Episodic Memory: A Meta-analysis | journal = J.

=== Operant conditioning ===

[[Operant conditioning]] sometimes referred to as Skinnerian conditioning is the process of strengthening a behavior by reinforcing it or weakening it by punishing it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; By continually strengthening and reinforcing a behavior, or weakening and punishing a behavior an association as well as a consequence is made. Similarly, a behavior that is altered by its consequences is known as operant behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Martin G. |author2=Pear J.  |last-author-amp=yes | year =2011 | title= Behavior modification: What it is and how to do it }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are multiple components of operant conditioning; these include reinforcement such as positive reinforcers and negative reinforcers. A positive reinforcer is a stimulus which, when presented immediately following a behavior, causes the behavior to increase in frequency. Negative reinforcers are a stimulus whose removal immediately after a response cause the response to be strengthened or to increase in frequency. Additionally, components of punishment are also incorporated such as [[positive punishment]] and negative punishment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Examples of operant conditioning can be seen every day. When a student tells a joke to one of his peers and they all laugh at this joke, this student is more likely to continue this behavior of telling jokes because his joke was reinforced by the sound of their laughing. However, if a peer tells the student his joke is "silly" or "stupid", he will be punished by telling the joke and his likelihood to tell another joke is greatly decreased. Another example of operant conditioning can be seen in the form of quitting a habit such as smoking. By using this technique to quit smoking, self-discipline must be displayed as the smoker must stop giving into their addiction.

=== Punishment ===

Self-punishment of responses would include the arranging of punishment contingent upon undesired responses. This might be seen in the behavior of whipping oneself which some monks and religious persons do. This is different from aversive stimulation in that, for example, the alarm clock generates escape from the alarm, while self-punishment presents stimulation after the fact to reduce the probability of future behavior.&lt;ref name="Skinner237"&gt;Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Punishment is more like conformity than self-control because with self-control there needs to be an internal drive, not an external source of punishment that makes the person want to do something. There is external locus of control which is similar to determinism and there is internal locus of control which is similar to free will. With a learning system of punishment the person does not make their decision based upon what they want, rather they base it on the external factors. When you use a negative reinforcement you are more likely to influence their internal decisions and allow them to make the choice on their own whereas with a punishment the person will make their decisions based upon the consequences and not exert self-control. The best way to learn self-control is with free will where people are able to perceive they are making their own choices.&lt;ref&gt;Logue, Self Control: Waiting Until Tomorrow For What You Want Today 34-77&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Doing something else" ===

Skinner noted that various philosophies and religions exemplified this principle by instructing believers to love their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Walden Two 1948&lt;/ref&gt; When we are filled with rage or hatred we might control ourselves by 'doing something else' or more specifically something that is incompatible with our response.

==Brain regions involved==
[[Functional imaging]] of the brain has shown that self-control is correlated with an area in the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] (dlPFC), a part of the [[frontal lobe]].  This area is distinct from those involved in generating intentional actions, attention to intentions, or select between alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/27/34/9141 | pmid = 17715350 | doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0924-07.2007 | volume=27 | issue=34 | title=To do or not to do: the neural signature of self-control |date=August 2007 | journal=J. Neurosci. | pages=9141–5 | author=Brass M, Haggard P| last2 = Haggard }}&lt;/ref&gt; This control occurs through the  top-down inhibition of [[premotor cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kühn | first1 = S | last2 = Haggard | first2 = P | last3 = Brass | first3 = M | year = 2009 | title = Intentional inhibition: How the "veto-area" exerts control | url = | journal = Hum Brain Mapp. | volume = 30 | issue = 9| pages = 2834–2843 | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20711 | pmid = 19072994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate about the mechanism of self-control and how it emerges. Traditionally, researchers believed the bottom-up approach guided self-control behavior. The more time a person spends thinking about a rewarding stimulus, the more likely he or she will experience a desire for it. Information that is most important gains control of working memory, and can then be processed through a top-down mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=B.T.|author2=D'Esposito, M.|title=Searching for "the top" in top-down control|journal=Neuron|year=2005|volume=48|pages=535–538|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.11.002|pmid=16301170|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knudsen|first=E.I.|title=Fundamental components of attention|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|year=2007|volume=30|pages=57–78|doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.30.051606.094256|pmid=17417935}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing evidence suggests that top down processing plays a strong role in self-control. Specifically, top-down processing can actually regulate bottom-up attentional mechanisms. To demonstrate this, researchers studied working memory and distraction by presenting participants with neutral or negative pictures and then a math problem or no task. They found that participants reported less negative moods after solving the math problem compared to the no task group, which was due to an influence on working memory capacity.&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Dillen|first=L.F.|author2=Koole, S.L. |title=Clearing the mind: A working memory model distraction from negative mood|journal=Emotion|year=2007|volume=7|issue=4|pages=715–723|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.7.4.715|pmid=18039038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many researchers working on identifying the brain areas involved in the exertion of self-control; many different areas are known to be involved. In relation to self-control mechanisms, the reward centers in the brain compare external stimuli versus internal need states and a person’s learning history.&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hofmann|first=W.|author2=Friese, M. |author3=Strack, F. |title=Impulse and self-control from a dual-systems perspective|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|year=2009|volume=4|issue=2|pages=162–176|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2009.01116.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the biological level, a loss of control is thought to be caused by a malfunctioning of a decision mechanism. A mechanistic explanation of self-control is still in its infancy. However, there is strong demand for knowledge about these mechanism because knowledge of these mechanisms would have tremendous clinical application.
Much of the work on how the brain reaches decisions is based on evidence from perceptual learning.

Many of the tasks that subjects are tested on are not tasks typically associated with self-control, but are more general decision tasks. Nevertheless, the research on self-control is informed by more general research on decision tasks. Sources for evidence on the neural mechanisms of self-control include fMRI studies on human subject, neural recordings on animals, lesion studies on humans and animals, and clinical behavioral studies on humans with self-control disorders.

There is broad agreement that the cortex is involved in self-control. The details of the final model have yet to be worked out. However, there are some enticing findings that suggest a mechanistic account of self-control could prove to have tremendous explanatory value. What follows is a survey of some of the important recent literature on the brain regions involved in self-control.

===Prefrontal cortex===

The prefrontal cortex is located in the most anterior portion of the frontal lobe in the brain. It forms a larger portion of the cortex in humans. The dendrites in the prefrontal cortex contain up to 16 times as many dendritic spines as neurons in other cortical areas. Due to this, the prefrontal cortex integrates a large amount of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | author = Kalat, J. W. | year =2013 | title= Biological Psychology| page=104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[orbitofrontal cortex]] cells are important factors for self-control. If an individual has the choice between an immediate reward or a more valuable reward which they can receive later, an individual would most likely try to control the impulse to take that immediate reward. If an individual has a damaged orbitofrontal cortex, this impulse control will most likely not be as strong, and they may be more likely to take the immediate reinforcement. Additionally, we see lack of impulse control in children because the prefrontal cortex develops slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Kalat, J. W. | year =2013 | title= Biological Psychology| page=406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd A. Hare ''et al.'' use functional MRI techniques to show that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are crucially involved in the exertion of self-control. They found that activity in the vmPFC was correlated with goal values and that the exertion of self-control required the modulation of the vmPFC by the DLPFC. The study found that a lack of self-control was strongly correlated with reduced activity in the DLPFC. Hare’s study is especially relevant to the self-control literature because it suggests that an important cause of poor self-control is a defective DLPFC.&lt;ref name="Hare 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |pages=646–8 |doi=10.1126/science.1168450 |title=Self-Control in Decision-Making Involves Modulation of the vmPFC Valuation System |year=2009 |last1=Hare |first1=T. A. |last2=Camerer |first2=C. F. |last3=Rangel |first3=A. |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5927 |pmid=19407204|bibcode=2009Sci...324..646H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outcomes as determining whether a choice is made===

[[Alexandra W. Logue]] is interested in how outcomes change the possibilities of a self-control choice being made.  Logue identifies three possible outcome effects: outcome delays, outcome size, and outcome contingencies.&lt;ref name="Logue1995"/&gt;  The delay of an outcome results in the perception that the outcome is less valuable than an outcome which is more readily achieved. The devaluing of the delayed outcome can cause less self-control.  A way to increase self-control in situations of a delayed outcome is to pre-expose an outcome. Pre-exposure reduces the frustrations related to the delay of the outcome. An example of this is signing bonuses.

Outcome size deals with the relative, perceived size of possible outcomes.  There tends to be a relationship between the value of the incentive and the desired outcome; the larger the desired outcome, the larger the value.  Some factors that decrease value include delay, effort/cost, and uncertainty. The decision tends to be based on the option with the higher value at the time of the decision.

Finally, Logue defines the relationship between responses and outcomes as outcome contingencies.&lt;ref name="Logue1995"/&gt;  Outcome contingencies also impact the degree of self-control that a person exercises.  For instance, if a person is able to change his choice after the initial choice is made, the person is far more likely to take the impulsive, rather than self-controlled, choice.  Additionally, it is possible for people to make precommitment action.  A precommitment action is an action meant to lead to a self-controlled action at a later period in time.  When a person sets an alarm clock, they are making a precommitted response to wake up early in the morning.  Hence, that person is more likely to exercise the self-controlled decision to wake up, rather than to fall back in bed for a little more sleep.

[[Cassandra B. Whyte]] studied [[locus of control]] and academic performance and determined that internals tend to achieve at a higher level.  Internals may perceive they have options from which to choose, thus facilitating more hopeful decision-making behavior as opposed to dependence on externally determined outcomes that require less commitment, effort, or self-control.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, Cassandra B., (1975) A Specific Study of the Effects of Three Modes of Counseling on the Academic Achievement and Internal External Locus of Control of High-Risk College Freshmen. Dissertation Abstracts,.48106. 36 (4).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whyte | first1 = Cassandra Bolyard | year = 1978 | title = Effective Counseling Methods for High-Risk College Freshmen | url = | journal = Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 198–200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiology of behavior===

Many things affect one's ability to exert self-control, but it seems that self-control requires sufficient [[glucose]] levels in the brain. Exerting self-control depletes glucose. Reduced glucose, and poor glucose tolerance (reduced ability to transport glucose to the brain) are correlated with lower performance in tests of self-control, particularly in difficult new situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Gailliot MT, Baumeister RF | title=The physiology of willpower: linking blood glucose to self-control | journal=Pers Soc Psychol Rev | year=2007 | volume=11 | issue=4 | pages=303–27 | pmid=18453466 | url=http://carlo-hamalainen.net/stuff/Gailliot%20Baumeister%20-%20The%20physiology%20of%20willpower:%20linking%20blood%20glucose%20to%20self-control.pdf | doi=10.1177/1088868307303030 | last2=Baumeister | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628195739/http://carlo-hamalainen.net/stuff/Gailliot%20Baumeister%20-%20The%20physiology%20of%20willpower%3A%20linking%20blood%20glucose%20to%20self-control.pdf | archivedate=2013-06-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-control demands that an individual work to overcome thoughts, emotions, and automatic responses/impulses. These strong efforts require higher blood glucose levels. Lower blood glucose levels can lead to unsuccessful self-control abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal| author = Gailliot M.T., Baumeister R.F., DeWall C.

Furthermore, failure of self-control occurs most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively. Self-control thus appears highly susceptible to glucose.&lt;ref name=GailliotBaumeister2007&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gailliot MT, Baumeister RF | title=The physiology of willpower: linking blood glucose to self-control | journal=Pers Soc Psychol Rev | year=2007 | volume=11 | issue=4 | pages=303–27 | pmid=18453466 | url=http://carlo-hamalainen.net/stuff/Gailliot%20Baumeister%20-%20The%20physiology%20of%20willpower:%20linking%20blood%20glucose%20to%20self-control.pdf | doi=10.1177/1088868307303030 | last2=Baumeister | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628195739/http://carlo-hamalainen.net/stuff/Gailliot%20Baumeister%20-%20The%20physiology%20of%20willpower%3A%20linking%20blood%20glucose%20to%20self-control.pdf | archivedate=2013-06-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative explanation of the limited amounts of glucose that are found is that this depends on the allocation of glucose, not on limited supply of glucose. According to this theory, the brain has sufficient resources of glucose and also has the possibility of delivering the glucose, but the personal priorities and motivations of the individual cause the glucose to be allocated to other sites. This theory has not been tested yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beedie|first=Christopher|author2=Andrew M.

== The Mischel Experiments ==
In the 1960s, [[Walter Mischel]] tested four-year-old children for self-control in "The Marshmallow Test": the children were each given a [[marshmallow]] and told that they can eat it anytime they want, but if they waited 15 minutes, they would receive another marshmallow. Follow up studies showed that the results correlated well with these children's success levels in later life.&lt;ref&gt;Mischel, W., Shoda, Yth the members of the original study whom he was able to find. His reported results appear to show that the life-expectancy of the group was more strongly correlated with their assessed self-control level than anything else&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reported in the book "The Attitude Factor" by Thomas Blakeslee&lt;/ref&gt;

A strategy used in the marshmallow test was the focus on "hot" and "cool" features of an object. The children were encouraged to think about the marshmallow's "cool features" such as its shape and texture, possibly comparing it to a cotton ball or a cloud. The "hot features" of the marshmallow would be its sweet, sticky tastiness. These hot features make it more difficult to delay gratification. By focusing on the cool features, the mind is adverted from the appealing aspects of the marshmallow, and self-control is more plausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Casey |first=B.J |title=Behavioral and neural correlates of delay of gratification 40 years later |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=May 28, 2011 |volume=108 |issue=36 |pages=14998–5003 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1108561108 |pmid=21876169 |last2=Somerville |first2=L.

Years later Dr. Mischel reached out to the participants of his study who were then in their 40's. He found that those who showed less self-control by taking the single marshmallow in the initial study were more likely to develop problems with relationships, stress, and drug abuse later in life. Dr. Mischel carried out the experiment again with the same participants in order to see which parts of the brain were active during the process of self-control. The participants received scans through M.R.I to show brain activity. The results showed that those who exhibited lower levels of self-control had higher brain activity in the ventral striatum, the area that deals with positive rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Patricia |title=At the Vortex of Self-Control: [The Arts/Cultural Desk] |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews concluded that self-control is correlated with various positive life outcomes, such as happiness, adjustment and various positive psychological factors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  Self-control was also negatively correlated with [[sociotropy]]&lt;ref name="sato-2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sato | first1 = T. | last2 = Harman | first2 = B.

== Ego depletion ==
{{main article|Ego depletion}}

There's conflicting evidence about whether will power is finite, infinite or self-reinforcing resource, a phenomenon sometimes termed ego depletion or reverse ego depletion &lt;ref&gt;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/12/14/strongest-evidence-yet-for-ego-depletion-the-idea-that-self-control-is-a-limited-resource/&lt;/ref&gt;. However, belief that will-power is infinite &lt;ref&gt;journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797610384745&lt;/ref&gt; or self-reinforcing &lt;ref&gt;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/12/14/strongest-evidence-yet-for-ego-depletion-the-idea-that-self-control-is-a-limited-resource/&lt;/ref&gt; is associated with greater will power, voluntary executive function.

Exerting self-control through the [[executive functions]] in [[decision making]] is held in some theories to [[ego depletion|deplete]] one's ability to do so in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vohs KD, Baumeister RF, Schmeichel BJ, Twenge JM, Nelson NM, Tice DM |title=Making choices impairs subsequent self-control: a limited-resource account of decision making, f-regulation, and active initiative |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=94 |issue=5 |pages=883–98 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18444745 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.5.883 |url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp945883.pdf|format=PDF|last2=Baumeister |last3=Schmeichel |last4=Twenge |last5=Nelson |last6=Tice }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ego depletion is the view that high self-control requires energy and focus, and over an extended period of self-control demands, this self-control can lessen. There are ways to help this ego depletion. One way is through rest and relaxation from these high demands. Additionally, training self-control with certain behaviors can also help to strengthen an individual’s self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author = Hagger M.S., Wood C., Stiff C., Chatzisarantis N.L. | title = Ego depletion and the strength model of self control: A meta-analysis |journal = Psychological Bulletin |volume = 136| issue = 4 | pages = 495–525 | year=2010 | doi = 10.1037/a0019486 | url = http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;sid=e1c32b5b-858d-4cd4-88de-266f63ddb869%40sessionmgr114&amp;hid=112&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWNvb2tpZSxpcCxjcGlkJmN1c3RpZD1zODQxOTIzOSZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmU%3d#db=pdh&amp;AN=2010-12718-004 | pmid=20565167| last2 = Wood | last3 = Stiff | last4 = Chatzisarantis }}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to be particularly effective in those who would otherwise have difficulty controlling their impulses in the domain of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author =Denson, T.F., Capper, M.

One study in particular analyzed the impact of approaching a temptation by defining it in abstract, general terms as opposed to specific, concrete details. For the purposes of the study, approaching a situation using general terms was defined as the high-level construal condition whereas using specific details was termed the low-level construal condition.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fujita 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fujita|first=Kentaro|author2=Trope, Yaacov |author3=Liberman, Nira |author4= Levin-Sagi, Maya |title=Construal levels and self-control|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=90|issue=3|pages=351–367|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.3.351|pmid=16594824 |pmc=3153425}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study involved 42 college students who were randomly assigned to either the high-level or low-level construal condition. The participants were then presented with a packet that described five scenarios, each one involving a unique self-control conflict. For those participants in the high-level construal condition the scenarios were described using only general terms and for those in the low-level construal condition the scenarios were described using only specific details. After imagining themselves in each scenario, the participants were asked to indicate how bad they would feel if they indulged in the temptation using a six-point scale ranging from "not at all bad" to "very bad." The data showed that participants in the high-level construal condition reported greater negative evaluations of temptations than did participants in the low-level construal conditions.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fujita 2006" /&gt; This implies that individuals using high-level construals are better able to place a temptation in context and properly evaluate its long-term impact, and therefore are more likely to maintain self-control.

== Kelly McGonigal's approach ==

[[Kelly McGonigal]] defines willpower as "the ability to do what you really want to do when part of you really doesn’t want to do it." It consists of three competing elements: 1) I will – the ability to do what you need to do; 2) I won’t – the other side of self-control; the ability to resist temptation; and 3) I want – your true want, the ability to remember the big picture of your life.&lt;ref name="McGonigal, K. 2012"&gt;McGonigal, K. (2012). The willpower instinct: How self-control works, why it matters and what you can do to get more of it.  New York: Avery.&lt;/ref&gt; Willpower is a resource that gets depleted, particularly when you are rundown or hungry. However, you may increase your capacity for willpower by engaging in activities such as mindfulness, meditation and exercise and/or by ensuring good nutrition and adequate sleep.&lt;ref name="McGonigal, K. 2012"/&gt;

{{Sri Aurobindo}}
{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Sri Aurobindo''' (born '''Aurobindo Ghose'''; 15 August 1872&amp;nbsp;– 5 December 1950) was an Indian philosopher, [[yogi]], [[guru]], poet, and [[Indian nationalism|nationalist]].{{sfnp|McDermott|1994|pp=11–12, 14|ps=}} He joined the [[Indian independence movement|Indian movement]] for independence from [[British Raj|British rule]], for a while was one of its influential leaders and then became a spiritual reformer, introducing his visions on human progress and [[spiritual evolution]].

Aurobindo studied for the [[Imperial Civil Service|Indian Civil Service]] at [[King's College, Cambridge]], [[England]]. After returning to India he took up various civil service works under the [[maharaja]] of the [[princely state]] of [[Baroda State|Baroda]] and became increasingly involved in [[Indian National Congress|nationalist politics]] and the [[Anushilan Samiti|nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal]]. He was arrested in the aftermath of a number of bomb outrages linked [[Anushilan samiti|to his organisation]], but in a highly public trial where he [[Emperor vs Aurobindo Ghosh and others|faced charges of treason]], Aurobindo could only be convicted and imprisoned for writing articles against [[British India|British rule]] in India. He was released when no evidence could be provided, following the murder of a prosecution witness during the trial. During his stay in the jail, he had mystical and spiritual experiences, after which he moved to [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], leaving politics for [[Spirituality|spiritual]] work.

During his stay in Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo developed a method of spiritual practice he called [[Integral Yoga]]. The central theme of his vision was the evolution of human life into a life [[divine]]. He believed in a spiritual realisation that not only liberated man but transformed his nature, enabling a divine life on earth. In 1926, with the help of his spiritual collaborator, [[Mirra Alfassa]] (referred to as "The Mother"), he founded the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]].

His main literary works are ''The Life Divine'', which deals with theoretical aspects of Integral Yoga; ''Synthesis of Yoga'', which deals with practical guidance to Integral Yoga; and ''[[Savitri: A Legend and a Symbol]]'', an [[epic poem]]. His works also include philosophy, poetry, translations and commentaries on the ''[[Vedas]]'', ''[[Upanishads]]'' and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''. He was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1943 and for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=567 Nomination database] Nobel.org accessed 28 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Aurobindo Ghose was born in [[Calcutta]] (now Kolkata), [[Bengal Presidency]], India on 15 August 1872 in a [[Bengali Kayastha]] family that was associated with the village of [[Konnagar]] in the [[Hooghly district|Hoogly]] district. His father, Krishna Dhun Ghose, was then Assistant Surgeon of [[Rangpur District|Rangpur]] in Bengal, and a former member of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] religious reform movement who had become enamoured with the then-new idea of [[evolution]] while pursuing medical studies in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Bengal: change and continuity, Issues 16-20|publisher=Asian Studies Center, Michigan State University|year=1971|page=32|editor1=Robert Paul Beech|editor2= Mary Jane Beech|author= Ingrid Aall |quote=Aurobindo's father, Dr. Krishnadhan Ghose, came from a Kayastha family associated with the village of Konnagar in Hooghly District near Calcutta, Dr. Ghose had his medical training in Edinburgh...}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Aurobindo described his father as a "tremendous atheist" but Thakur calls him an agnostic and Heehs believes that he followed his own coda.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=3–7, 10|ps=}}{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=3|ps=}}}} His mother was Swarnalata Devi, whose father was [[Rajnarayan Bose|Shri Rajnarayan Bose]], a leading figure in the Samaj. She had been sent to the more salubrious surroundings of Calcutta for Aurobindo's birth. Aurobindo had two elder siblings, Benoybhusan and [[Manmohan Ghose|Manmohan]], a younger sister, Sarojini, and a younger brother, [[Barindra Kumar Ghosh|Barindrakumar]] (also referred to as Barin).{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=3–7, 10|ps=}}{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=3|ps=}}

Young Aurobindo was brought up speaking English but used [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] to communicate with servants. Although his family were [[Bengali people|Bengali]], his father believed British culture to be superior. He and his two elder siblings were sent to the English-speaking [[Loreto Convent, Darjeeling|Loreto House]] boarding school in [[Darjeeling]], in part to improve their language skills and in part to distance them from their mother, who had developed a mental illness soon after the birth of her first child. Darjeeling was a centre of British life in India and the school was run by Irish nuns, through which the boys would have been exposed to Christian religious teachings and symbolism.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=8–9|ps=}}

=== England (1879–1893) ===

[[File:Aurobindo.family.jpg|125px|thumb|upright|left|Aurobindo (seated center next to his mother) and his family. In England, ca. 1879.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=10|ps=}}]]

Krishna Dhun Ghose wanted his sons to enter the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Indian Civil Service]] (ICS), an elite organisation comprising around 1000 people. To achieve this it was necessary that they study in England and so it was there that the entire family moved in 1879.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=9–10|ps=}}{{efn|Krishna Dhun Ghose returned to India soon after, leaving his wife in the care of a physician in London. Barindra was born in England in January 1880.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=10|ps=}}}} The three brothers were placed in the care of the Reverend W. H. Drewett in [[Manchester]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=9–10|ps=}} Drewett was a minister of the [[Congregational Church]] whom Krishna Dhun Ghose knew through his British friends at Rangapur.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=10, 13|ps=}}{{efn|While in Manchester, the Ghose brothers lived first at 84 Shakespeare Street and then, by the time of the 1881 census, at 29 York Place, [[Chorlton-on-Medlock]]. Aurobindo was recorded in the census as Aravinda Ghose, as he was also by the University of Cambridge.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=14|ps=}}{{sfn|1881 Census|ps=}}{{sfn|ACAD|GHS890AA}}}}

The boys were taught [[Latin (language)|Latin]] by Drewett and his wife. This was a prerequisite for admission to good English schools and, after two years, in 1881, the elder two siblings were enrolled at [[Manchester Grammar School]]. Aurobindo was considered too young for enrolment and he continued his studies with the Drewetts, learning history, Latin, [[French language|French]], geography and arithmetic. Although the Drewetts were told not to teach religion, the boys inevitably were exposed to Christian teachings and events, which generally bored Aurobindo and sometimes repulsed him. There was little contact with his father, who wrote only a few letters to his sons while they were in England, but what communication there was indicated that he was becoming less endeared to the British in India than he had been, on one occasion describing the British Raj as a "heartless government".{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=14|ps=}}
[[File:Basement of 49 St Stephen's Avenue with Sri Aurobindo Blue Plaque.JPG|thumb|250px|upright| Basement of 49 St Stephen's Avenue, London W12 with Sri Aurobindo [[Blue Plaque]]]]
Drewett emigrated to Australia in 1884, causing the boys to be uprooted as they went to live with Drewett's mother in London. In September of that year, Aurobindo and Manmohan joined [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] there.{{efn|Benoybhusan's education ended in Manchester.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=19|ps=}}}} He learned Greek and spent the last three years reading literature and English poetry. He also acquired some familiarity with the German and Italian languages and, exposed to the evangelical strictures of Drewett's mother, a distaste for religion. He considered himself at one point to be an atheist but later determined that he was agnostic.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=14–18|ps=}} A [[blue plaque]] unveiled in 2007 commemorates Aurobindo's residence at 49 St Stephen's Avenue in [[Shepherd's Bush]], London, from 1884 to 1887.{{sfn|English Heritage|ps=}} The three brothers began living in spartan circumstances at the Liberal Club in [[South Kensington]] during 1887, their father having experienced some financial difficulties. The Club's secretary was James Cotton, brother of their father's friend in the Bengal ICS, [[Henry John Stedman Cotton|Henry Cotton]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=18|ps=}}

By 1889, Manmohan had determined to pursue a literary career and Benoybhusan had proved himself unequal to the standards necessary for ICS entrance. This meant that only Aurobindo might fulfil his father's aspirations but to do so when his father lacked money required that he studied hard for a scholarship.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=19|ps=}} To become an ICS official, students were required to pass the competitive examination, as well as to study at an English university for two years under probation. Aurobindo secured a scholarship at King's College, Cambridge, under recommendation of [[Oscar Browning]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|pp=29–30|ps=}} He passed the written ICS examination after a few months, being ranked 11th out of 250 competitors. He spent the next two years at King's College.{{sfn|ACAD|GHS890AA}} Aurobindo had no interest in the ICS and came late to the horse-riding practical exam purposefully to get himself disqualified for the service.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=31|ps=}}

At this time, the Maharaja of Baroda, [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III]], was travelling in England. Cotton secured for him a place in Baroda State Service and arranged for him to meet the prince.{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=6|ps=}} He left England for India,{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=6|ps=}} arriving there in February 1893.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=34|ps=}} In India, Krishna Dhun Ghose, who was waiting to receive his son, was misinformed by his agents from [[Bombay]] (now Mumbai) that the ship on which Aurobindo had been travelling had sunk off the coast of Portugal. His father died upon hearing this news.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=36|ps=}}{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=7|ps=}}

In Baroda, Aurobindo joined the state service in 1893, working first in the Survey and Settlements department, later moving to the Department of Revenue and then to the Secretariat, and much miscellaneous work like teaching grammar and assisting in writing speeches for the Maharaja of [[Gaekwad]] until 1897.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=37|ps=}} In 1897 during his work in Baroda, he started working as a part-time French teacher at [[Baroda College]] (now Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda). He was later promoted to the post of vice-principal.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=42|ps=}} At Baroda, Aurobindo self-studied [[Sanskrit]] and [[Bengali (language)|Bengali]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=43|ps=}}
[[File:Bande mataram.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Copy of ''Bande Mataram'', September 1907]]
During his stay at Baroda, he contributed to many articles to ''Indu Prakash'' and spoke as a chairman of the Baroda college board.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=68|ps=}} He started taking an active interest in the politics of India's independence struggle against British rule, working behind the scenes as his position in the Baroda state administration barred him from an overt political activity. He linked up with resistance groups in Bengal and [[Madhya Pradesh]], while traveling to these states. He established contact with [[Lokmanya Tilak]] and [[Sister Nivedita]].

Aurobindo often travelled between Baroda and Bengal, at first in a bid to re-establish links with his parent's families and other Bengali relatives, including his sister Sarojini and brother Barin, and later increased to establish resistance groups across the Presidency. He formally moved to Calcutta in 1906 after the announcement of the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]]. In 1901, on a visit  to Calcutta, he married 14-year-old Mrinalini, the daughter of Bhupal Chandra Bose, a senior official in government service. Aurobindo was 28 at that time. Mrinalini died seventeen years later in December 1918 during the [[1918 flu pandemic|influenza pandemic]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=53|ps=}}

Aurobindo was influenced by studies on rebellion and revolutions against England in medieval France and the revolts in America and Italy. In his public activities he favoured [[Non-cooperation movement|non-co-operation]] and passive resistance; in private he took up secret revolutionary activity as a preparation for open revolt, in case that the passive revolt failed.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=71|ps=}}

In Bengal, with Barin's help, he established contacts with revolutionaries, inspiring radicals such as [[Bagha Jatin]] or Jatin Mukherjee and Surendranath Tagore. He helped establish a series of youth clubs, including the [[Anushilan Samiti]] of Calcutta in 1902.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=67|ps=}}

Aurobindo attended the 1906 [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] meeting headed by [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] and participated as a councillor in forming the fourfold objectives of "Swaraj, Swadesh, Boycott and national education". In 1907 at the Surat session of Congress where moderates and extremists had a major showdown, he led along with extremists along with [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]]. The Congress split after this session.{{sfnp|Thorpe|2010|p=29|ps=C}} In 1907–1908 Aurobindo travelled extensively to [[Pune]], Bombay and Baroda to firm up support for the nationalist cause, giving speeches and meeting with groups. He was arrested again in May 1908 in connection with the [[Alipore Bomb Case]]. He was acquitted in the ensuing trial, following the murder of chief prosecution witness Naren Gosain within jail premises which subsequently led to the case against him collapsing. Aurobindo was subsequently released after a year of isolated incarceration.

Once out of the prison he started two new publications, ''Karmayogin'' in English and ''Dharma'' in Bengali. He also delivered the [[s:Uttarpara Speech|Uttarpara Speech]] hinting at the transformation of his focus to spiritual matters. The British persecution continued because of his writings in his new journals and in April 1910 Aurobindo moved to Pondicherry, where Britain's [[secret police]] monitored his activities.{{sfnp|Lorenzo|1999|p=70|ps=}}{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=217|ps=}}

=== Conversion from politics to spirituality ===
[[File:Aurobindo jail picture.JPG|thumb|upright|225px|left| Photographs of Aurobindo
as a prisoner in [[Alipore Jail]], 1908.]]
In July 1905 then [[Viceroy of India]], [[Lord Curzon]], [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partitioned Bengal]]. This sparked an outburst of public anger against the British, leading to civil unrest and a nationalist campaign by groups of revolutionaries, who included Aurobindo. In 1908, [[Khudiram Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chaki]] attempted to kill Magistrate Kingsford, a judge known for handing down particularly severe sentences against nationalists. However, the bomb thrown at his horse carriage missed its target and instead landed in another carriage and killed two British women, the wife and daughter of barrister [[Pringle Kennedy]]. Aurobindo was also arrested on charges of planning and overseeing the attack and imprisoned in solitary confinement in [[Alipore Jail]]. The trial of the Alipore Bomb Case lasted for a year, but eventually, he was acquitted on May 6, 1909. His defence counsel was [[Chittaranjan Das]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=86|ps=}}

During this period in the Jail, his view of life was radically changed due to spiritual experiences and realizations. Consequently, his aim went far beyond the service and liberation of the country. {{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=61|ps=}}

Aurobindo said he was "visited" by [[Vivekananda]] in the Alipore Jail: "It is a fact that I was hearing constantly the voice of Vivekananda speaking to me for a fortnight in the jail in my solitary meditation and felt his presence."{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=98|ps=}}

In his autobiographical notes, Aurobindo said he felt a vast sense of calmness when he first came back to India. He could not explain this and continued to have various such experiences from time to time. He knew nothing of yoga at that time and started his practise of it without a teacher, except for some rules that he learned from Ganganath, a friend who was a disciple of [[Brahmananda]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=110|ps=}} &lt;!--When Sri Aurobindo became involved with Congress and ''Vande Mataram'', Barin had continued to meet patriotic youngsters for recruitment for such a plan.{{clarify|reason=what plan?}}--&gt; In 1907, Barin introduced Aurobindo to Vishnu Bhaskar Lele, a Maharashtrian yogi. Aurobindo was influenced by the guidance he got from the yogi, who had instructed Aurobindo to depend on an inner guide and any kind of external guru or guidance would not be required.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=142–143|ps=}}

In 1910 Aurobindo withdrew himself from all political activities and went into hiding at [[Chandannagar]] in the house of [[Motilal Roy]], while the British were trying to prosecute him for sedition on the basis of a signed article titled 'To My Countrymen', published in ''Karmayogin''. As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was held back and the prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but the warrant could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry, then a [[French colony]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=101|ps=}} The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn.

=== Pondicherry (1910–1950) ===
In Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo dedicated himself to his spiritual and philosophical pursuits. In 1914, after four years of secluded yoga, he started a monthly philosophical magazine called ''[[Arya (journal)|Arya]]''. This ceased publication in 1921. Many years later, he revised some of these works before they were published in book form. Some of the book series derived out of this publication was ''The Life Divine'', ''The Synthesis of Yoga'', ''Essays on The Gita'', ''The Secret of The Veda'', ''Hymns to the Mystic Fire'', ''The Upanishads'', ''The Renaissance in India'', ''War and Self-determination'', ''The Human Cycle'', ''The Ideal of Human Unity'' and ''The Future Poetry'' were published in this magazine.{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|pp=31–33|ps=}}

At the beginning of his stay at Pondicherry, there were few followers, but with time their numbers grew, resulting in the formation of the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]] in 1926.&lt;ref name="Sketch"&gt;{{citation |title=Sri Aurobindo: A Life Sketch |series=Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library |volume=30 |url=http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/ashram/sriauro/life_sketch.php |accessdate=1 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1926 he started to sign himself as ''Sri Aurobindo'', ''[[Sri]]'' (meaning holy in Sanskrit) being commonly used as an [[honorific]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=347|ps=: Sri Aurobindo without the surname seems to have first appeared in print in articles published in Chandernagore in 1920. It did not catch on at that time. He first signed his name Sri Aurobindo in March 1926, but continued to use Sri Aurobindo Ghose for a year or two.}}
[[File:Aurobindodeath.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Sri Aurobindo on his deathbed December 5, 1950]]
For some time afterwards, his main literary output was his voluminous correspondence with his disciples. His letters, most of which were written in the 1930s, numbered in the several thousand. Many were brief comments made in the margins of his disciple's notebooks in answer to their questions and reports of their spiritual practice—others extended to several pages of carefully composed explanations of practical aspects of his teachings. These were later collected and published in book form in three volumes of ''[[Letters on Yoga]].'' In the late 1930s, he resumed work on a poem he had started earlier—he continued to expand and revise this poem for the rest of his life.{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|pp=20–26|ps=}} It became perhaps his greatest literary achievement, ''[[Savitri (book)|Savitri]]'', an epic spiritual poem in [[blank verse]] of approximately 24,000 lines.{{sfnp|Yadav|2007|p=31|ps=: "the fame of Sri Aurobindo mainly rests upon Savitri which is considered as his magnum opus&amp;nbsp;... [It is] a 24000 line blank verse epic in which he has widened the original legend of the Mahabharata and turned it into a symbol where the soul of man, represented by Satyavan, is delivered from the grip of death and ignorance through the love and power of the Divine Mother, incarnated upon earth as Savitri."}}

Sri Aurobindo died on 5 December 1950. Around 60,000 people attended to see his body resting peacefully. Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], and the President [[Rajendra Prasad]] praised him for his contribution to Yogic philosophy and the independence movement. National and international newspapers commemorated his death.&lt;ref name=Sketch /&gt;{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pages= 411–412|chapter=Epilogue|ps=: "On the morning of December 6, 1950 all of the major newspapers of the country announced the passing of Sri Aurobindo&amp;nbsp;... President Rajendra Prasad, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, central and state ministers&amp;nbsp;... recalled his contribution to the struggle for freedom, his philosophical and other writings, and the example of his yogic discipline. Abroad, his death was noted by newspapers in London, Paris and New York. A writer in the Manchester Guardian called him 'the most massive philosophical thinker that modern India has produced.'"}}

=== Mirra Alfassa (The Mother) and the development of the Ashram ===
Sri Aurobindo's close spiritual collaborator, [[Mirra Alfassa]] (b. Alfassa), came to be known as ''The Mother''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |title= Leap of Perception: The Transforming Power of Your Attention |edition= 1 |year= 2013 |publisher= Atria books |location= New York |isbn= 978-1-58270-390-9 |page= 121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a [[French people|French national]], born in [[Paris]] on 21 February 1878. In her 20s she studied [[occultism]] with [[Max Theon]]. Along with her husband, Paul Richard, she went to Pondicherry on 29 March 1914,{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=102|ps=}} and finally settled there in 1920. Sri Aurobindo considered her his spiritual equal and collaborator. After 24 November 1926, when Sri Aurobindo retired into seclusion, he left it to her to plan, build and run the ashram, the community of disciples which had gathered around them. Sometime later, when families with children joined the ashram, she established and supervised the [[Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education]] with its experiments in the field of education. When he died in 1950, she continued their spiritual work, directed the ashram, and guided their disciples.{{sfnp|Jones|Ryan|2007|pp=292–293|ps=}}

=== Introduction ===
Sri Aurobindo's concept of the Integral Yoga system is described in his books, ''The Synthesis of Yoga'' and ''The Life Divine''. {{sfnp|McDermott|1994|p=281|ps=}} ''The Life Divine'' is a compilation of essays published serially in ''Arya.''

Sri Aurobindo argues that divine ''[[Brahman]]'' manifests as empirical reality through ''[[līlā]],'' or divine play. Instead of posting that the world we experience is an illusion (''[[Maya (illusion)|māyā]]'')'','' Aurobindo argues that world can evolve and become a new world with new species, far above the human species just as human species have evolved after the animal species.

Sri Aurobindo believed that [[Darwinism]] merely describes a phenomenon of the evolution of matter into life, but does not explain the reason behind it, while he finds life to be already present in matter, because all of existence is a manifestation of ''Brahman''. He argues that nature (which he interpreted as divine) has evolved life out of matter and the mind out of life.  All of existence, he argues, is attempting to manifest to the level of the supermind – that evolution [[teleology|had a purpose]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=5|ps=}}  He stated that he found the task of understanding the [[Metaphysics|nature of reality]] arduous and difficult to justify by immediate tangible results.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=7|ps=}}

=== Affinity with Western philosophy ===
In his writings, talks and letters Sri Aurobindo has referred to several European philosophers with whose basic concepts he was familiar, commenting on their ideas and discussing the question of affinity to his own line of thought. Thus he wrote a long essay on the Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]]&lt;ref&gt;Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo (CWSA) vol. 13, ''Essays in Philosophy and Yoga''
, Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram 1995, pp. 215-58 &lt;/ref&gt; and mentioned especially [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]], [[Nietzsche]] and [[Bergson]] as thinkers in whom he was interested because of their more intuitive approach.&lt;ref&gt; See chapters 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 in: Wilfried Huchzermeyer, ''Sri Aurobindo and European Philosophy'', Auroville 2016, {{ISBN|978-81-928152-9-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he felt little attraction for the philosophy of  [[Kant]] or [[Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;CWSA vol. 36, ''Autobiographical Notes'', p.112.&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies&lt;ref&gt; One of the more comprehensive titles is: K.D. Sethna. ''The Spirituality of the Future. A Search apropos of R.C. Zaehner’s Study in Sri Aurobindo and Teilhard de Chardin.'' London 1981&lt;/ref&gt; have shown a remarkable closeness to the evolutionary thought of [[Teilhard de Chardin]], whom he did not know, whereas the latter came to know of Sri Aurobindo at a late stage. After reading some chapters of ''The Life Divine'', he is reported to have said that Sri Aurobindo’s vision of evolution was basically the same as his own, though stated for Asian readers.&lt;ref&gt;''Sri Aurobindo and European Philosophy'', p. 127. The original source is given as K.D. Sethna, ''The Spirituality of the Future'', p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several scholars have discovered significant similarities in the thought of Sri Aurobindo and Hegel. Steve Odin has discussed this subject comprehensively in a comparative study.&lt;ref&gt; ''Sri Aurobindo and Hegel on the Involution-Evolution of Absolute Spirit.'' Philosophy East and West, Vol. 31, No. 2 (Apr. 1981), pp. 179-191&lt;/ref&gt; Odin writes that Sri Aurobindo "has appropriated Hegel’s notion of an Absolute Spirit and employed it to radically restructure the architectonic framework of the ancient Hindu Vedanta system in contemporary terms."&lt;ref&gt;Odin, p.179. (Sri Aurobindo himself denied to be influenced by Hegel. See A.B. Purani, ''Evening Talks with Sri Aurobindo.'' Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram 2001, p. 106)&lt;/ref&gt; In his analysis Odin arrives at the conclusion that "both philosophers similarly envision world creation as the progressive self-manifestation and evolutionary ascent of a universal consciousness in its journey toward Self-realization."&lt;ref&gt;Odin, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that in contrast to the deterministic and continuous dialectal unfolding of Absolute Reason by the mechanism of thesis-antithesis-synthesis or affirmation-negation-integration, "Sri Aurobindo argues for a creative, emergent mode of evolution."&lt;ref&gt;Odin, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; In his résumé Odin states that Sri Aurobindo has overcome the ahistorical world-vision of traditional Hinduism and presented a concept which allows for a genuine advance and novelty.&lt;ref&gt;Odin, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance of the Upanishads ===

Although Sri Aurobindo was familiar with the most important lines of thought in Western philosophy, he did not acknowledge their influence on his own writings.&lt;ref&gt;''Evening Talks with Sri Aurobindo'', p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that his philosophy "was formed first by the study of the [[Upanishads]] and the Gita… They were the basis of my first practice of Yoga." With the help of his readings he tried to move on to actual experience, "and it was on this experience that later on I founded my philosophy, not on ideas themselves.”&lt;ref&gt;CWSA vol. 36, ''Autobiographical Writings'', p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;  

He assumes that the seers of the Upanishads had basically the same approach and gives some details of his vision of the past in a long passage in ''The Renaissance of India''. "The Upanishads have been the acknowledged source of numerous profound philosophies and religions," he writes. Even [[Buddhism]] with all its developments was only a "restatement" from a new standpoint and with fresh terms. And, furthermore the ideas of the Upanishads "can be rediscovered in much of the thought of [[Pythagoras]] and Plato and form the profoundest part of [[Neo-platonism]] and [[Gnosticism]]…" Finally, the larger part of German metaphysics "is little more in substance than an intellectual development of great realities more spiritually seen in this ancient teaching."&lt;ref&gt;CWSA, vol. 20, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; When once he was asked by a disciple whether Plato got some of his ideas from Indian books, he responded that though something of the philosophy of India got through "by means of Pythagoras and others", he assumed that Plato got most of his ideas from intuition.&lt;ref&gt;CWSA vol. 27, ''Letters on Poetry and Art'', p. 520.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Aurobindo’s indebtedness to the Indian tradition also becomes obvious through his placing a large number of quotations from the [[Rig Veda]], the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Bhagavadgita]] at the beginning of the chapters in ''The Life Divine'', showing the connection of his own thought to [[Veda]] and [[Vedanta]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sri Aurobindo and European philosophy'', p.10; Heehs (2008), p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Isha Upanishad'' is considered to be one of the most important and more accessible writings of Sri Aurobindo.&lt;ref&gt;Heehs (2008), p.267&lt;/ref&gt; Before he published his final translation and analysis, he wrote ten incomplete commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;CWSA vol. 17, Publisher’s Note&lt;/ref&gt;  In a key passage he points out that the Brahman or Absolute is both the Stable and the Moving. "We must see it in eternal and immutable Spirit and in all the changing manifestations of universe and relativity."&lt;ref&gt;Heehs (2008), p. 267; CWSA 17:30&lt;/ref&gt;  Sri Aurobindo’s biographer K.R.S. Iyengar quotes R.S. Mugali as stating that Sri Aurobindo might have obtained in this Upanishad the thought-seed which later grew into ''The Life Divine''.&lt;ref&gt;''Sri Aurobindo – A Biography and a history.'' Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram 1972, p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Synthesis and Integration ===
[[Sisir Kumar Maitra]], who was a leading exponent of Sri Aurobindo’s Philosophy&lt;ref&gt;''Sri Aurobindo and European Philosophy'', p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;,  has referred to the issue of external influences and written that Sri Aurobindo does not mention names, but "as one reads his books one cannot fail to notice how thorough is his grasp of the great Western philosophers of the present age…" Although he is Indian one should not "underrate the influence of Western thought upon him. This influence is there, very clearly visible, but Sri Aurobindo... has not allowed himself to be dominated by it. He has made full use of Western thought, but he has made use of it for the purpose of building up his own system…"&lt;ref&gt;S.K. Maitra, ''The Meeting of the East and the West in Sri Aurobindo’s Philosophy'', Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram 2000 (1st ed. 1956), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Maitra, like Steve Odin&lt;ref&gt;Odin knew a comparative study of Maitra on Hegel and Sri Aurobindo. See ''Sri Aurobindo and European Philosophy'', p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;, sees Sri Aurobindo not only in the tradition and context of Indian, but also Western philosophy and assumes he may have adopted some elements from the latter for his synthesis.

R. Puligandla supports this viewpoint in his title ''Fundamentals of Indian Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;New York, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; He describes Sri Aurobindo’s philosophy as "an original synthesis of the Indian and Western traditions." "He integrates in a unique fashion the great social, political and scientific achievements of the modern West with the ancient and profound spiritual insights of [[Hinduism]]. The vision that powers the life divine of Aurobindo is none other than the Upanishadic vision of the unity of all existence."&lt;ref&gt;Puligandla, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; 

Puligandla believes that the Western influence also becomes evident through Sri Aurobindo’s critical position vis-à-vis [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]&lt;ref&gt;For Sri Aurobindo’s critique, see, for instance, CWSA vol. 17, ''Isha Upanishad'', pp.498-99. There he says that Shankara’s world-negative approach "has overshadowed for centuries the lives and souls of hundreds of millions of human beings." However, he also recognized him as "one of the mightiest of metaphysical intellects." (''Isha Upanishad'', p. 497)&lt;/ref&gt; and his assumption that the latter teaches through his Mayavada or Illusionism that the world is unreal and illusory. Puligandla objects, "nowhere does Shankara say that the world is unreal and illusory. Quite the contrary, through the concept of sublation he teaches that the world is neither real nor unreal. That this is indeed his teaching is further borne out by his distinction between lower and higher truths." Therefore, Puligandla concludes that "Aurobindo’s characterization of Shankara’s Vedanta as a world-negating philosophy is unfounded." He believes that Sri Aurobindo in his endeavour to synthesize Hindu and Western modes of thought has wrongly identified Shankara’s Mayavada with the subjective idealism of [[George Berkeley]], "which undoubtedly stands in sharp contrast to the realism of the Western philosophical tradition in general."&lt;ref&gt;Puligandla, pp. 267-68&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Puligandla believes that Sri Aurobindo was "a great philosopher-mystic" with a significant vision of man and the world.&lt;ref&gt;Puligandla, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Aurobindo’s critique of Shankara is supported by U. C. Dubey in his paper titled ''Integralism: The Distinctive Feature of Sri Aurobindo’s Philosophy.''&lt;ref&gt;Indrani Sanyal &amp; Krishna Roy, ''Understanding Thoughts of Sri Aurobindo''. New Delhi 2007, pp. 25-36 &lt;/ref&gt; He starts by summarizing what he considers to be Sri Aurobindo’s most important contributions to philosophy and mentions at first his integral view of Reality. "The creative force or 'cit-śakti' is regarded by him as one with the Absolute. Thus there is no opposition between the Absolute and its creative force in his system."&lt;ref&gt;Dubey, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Next Dubey refers to Sri Aurobindo’s  conception of the [[Supermind (Integral yoga)|supermind]] as the mediatory principle between the Absolute and the finite world and quotes S.K. Maitra stating that this conception "is the pivot round which the whole of Sri Aurobindo’s philosophy moves."&lt;ref&gt;Dubey, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dubey proceeds to analyse the approach of the Shankarites and believes that they follow an inadequate kind of logic that does not do justice to the challenge of tackling the problem of the Absolute, which cannot be known by finite reason. With the help of the finite reason, he says, "we are bound to determine the nature of reality as one or many, being or becoming. But Sri Aurobindo’s Integral Advaitism reconciles all apparently different aspects of Existence in an all-embracing unity of the Absolute."&lt;ref&gt;Dubey, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, Dubey explains that for Sri Aurobindo there is a higher reason, the "logic of the infinite" in which his integralism is rooted, and expounds this concept by presenting some quotations from ''The Life Divine''.&lt;ref&gt;Dubey, 29 &lt;/ref&gt; In concluding he notes critically "that Sri Aurobindo does not explain sufficiently the nature of the logic of the infinite." Nevertheless, "the way he proposes this logic is undoubtedly his unique contribution in the field of Absolutism."&lt;ref&gt;Dubey, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Aurobindo was an [[Indian nationalist movement|Indian nationalist]] but is best known for his philosophy on human evolution and Integral Yoga.{{sfnp|McDermott|1994|p=11|ps=}}

=== Influence ===
His influence has been wide-ranging. In India, [[Shishir Kumar Maitra|S. K. Maitra]], Anilbaran Roy and [[D. P. Chattopadhyaya]] commented on Sri Aurobindo's work. Writers on [[esotericism]] and traditional wisdom, such as [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Paul Brunton]], and [[Rene Guenon]], all saw him as an authentic representative of the Indian spiritual tradition.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=379|ps=}}

[[Haridas Chaudhuri]] and [[Frederic Spiegelberg]]&lt;ref&gt;Haridas Chaudhuri and Frederic Spiegelberg, ''The integral philosophy of Sri Aurobindo: a commemorative symposium'', Allen &amp; Unwin, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; were among those who were inspired by Aurobindo, who worked on the newly formed [[American Academy of Asian Studies]] in San Francisco. Soon after, Chaudhuri and his wife Bina established the Cultural Integration Fellowship, from which later emerged the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;"From the American Academy of Asian Studies to the California Institute of Integral Studies"[http://www.well.com/~davidu/aaas-ciis.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Aurobindo has influenced [[Subash Chandra Bose]] to take an initiative of dedicating to Indian National Movement fulltime. Bose writes "The illustrious example of Arabindo Ghosh looms large before my vision. I feel that I am ready to make the sacrifice which that example demands of me. "   &lt;ref&gt;" in his autobiography  AN INDIAN PILGRIM. "[https://books.google.co.in/books?id=W1QPWD0iBlQC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=%22The+illustrious+example+of+Aurobindo+Ghosh+looms+large+before+my+vision.+I+feel+that+I+am+ready+to+make+the+sacrifice+which+that+example+demands+of+me&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I-exFHe0yr&amp;sig=kSdMrPRNgL0-CI1SfWZiKJua9bc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi30rTOxPbeAhUjSo8KHbqWCUIQ6AEwAHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20illustrious%20example%20of%20Aurobindo%20Ghosh%20looms%20large%20before%20my%20vision.%20I%20feel%20that%20I%20am%20ready%20to%20make%20the%20sacrifice%20which%20that%20example%20demands%20of%20me&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] was heavily inspired by Satprem's writings about Sri Aurobindo during a week in May 1968, a time at which the composer was undergoing a personal crisis and had found Sri Aurobindo's philosophies were relevant to his feelings. After this experience, Stockhausen's music took a completely different turn, focusing on mysticism, that was to continue until the end of his career.{{sfnp|O'Mahony|2001|ps=}}

[[Jean Gebser]] has acknowledged Sri Aurobindo's influence on his work and referred to him several times in his writings. Thus, in ''The Invisible Origin'' he quotes a long passage from ''The Synthesis of Yoga''.&lt;ref&gt;''Sri Aurobindo and European Philosophy'', pp. 155-56&lt;/ref&gt; Gebser believes that he was "in some way brought into the extremely powerful spiritual field of force radiating through Sri Aurobindo."&lt;ref&gt;''Sri Aurobindo and European Philosophy'', p. 155. ''Der unsichtbare Ursprung'', Olten 1970, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; In his title ''Asia Smiles Differently'' he reports about his visit to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and meeting with the Mother whom he calls an "exceptionally gifted person."&lt;ref&gt;''Sri Aurobindo and European Philosophy'', p. 157. ''Asien lächelt anders'', Frankfurt 1968, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Irwin Thompson]] travelled to [[Auroville]] in 1972, where he met "The Mother". Thompson has called Sri Aurobindo's teaching on spirituality a "radical anarchism" and a "post-religious approach" and regards their work as having "...&amp;nbsp;reached back into the Goddess culture of prehistory, and, in Marshall McLuhan's terms, 'culturally retrieved' the archetypes of the shaman and ''la sage femme''...&amp;nbsp;" Thompson also writes that he experienced Shakti, or psychic power coming from The Mother on the night of her death in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thinking otherwise&amp;nbsp;– From Religion to Post-Religious Spirituality: Conclusion |url=http://www.wildriverreview.com/Column/Thinking-Otherwise/On-Religion/Post-Religious-Spirituality-Conclusion/William-Irwin-Thompson |accessdate=2014-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Aurobindo's ideas about the further evolution of human capabilities influenced the thinking of [[Michael Murphy (author)|Michael Murphy]]&amp;nbsp;– and indirectly, the [[human potential movement]], through Murphy's writings.{{sfnp|Kripal|2007|pp=60–63|ps=}}

The American philosopher [[Ken Wilber]] has called Sri Aurobindo "India's greatest modern philosopher sage"&lt;ref&gt;Ken Wilber, Foreword to A. S. Dalal (ed.), ''A Greater Psychology&amp;nbsp;– An Introduction to the Psychological Thought of Sri Aurobindo'', Tarcher/Putnam, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; and has integrated some of his ideas into his philosophical vision. Wilber's interpretation of Aurobindo has been criticised by [[Rod Hemsell]].&lt;ref&gt;Rod Hemsell, "[http://www.infinityfoundation.com/mandala/i_es/i_es_hemse_wilber.htm Ken Wilber and Sri Aurobindo: A Critical Perspective]" Jan. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Age]] writer [[Andrew Harvey (religious writer)|Andrew Harvey]] also looks to Sri Aurobindo as a major inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hidden Journey: A Spiritual Awakening |url=http://www.tricycle.com/reviews/hidden-journey-spiritual-awakening |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Followers ===
The following authors, disciples and organisations trace their intellectual heritage back to, or have in some measure been influenced by, Sri Aurobindo and The Mother.
* [[Chinmoy]] (1931–2007) joined the ashram in 1944. Later, he wrote the play about Sri Aurobindo's life – ''Sri Aurobindo: Descent of the Blue'' – and a book, ''Infinite: Sri Aurobindo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sri|first=Chinmoy|title=Sri Chinmoy's writings on Sri Aurobindo|url=http://www.srichinmoylibrary.com/spiritual/sri_aurobindo|accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An author, composer, artist and athlete, he was perhaps best known for holding public events on the theme of inner peace and world harmony (such as concerts, meditations, and races).{{sfnp|Dua|2005|pp=18–22|ps=}}
* [[Nolini Kanta Gupta]] (1889–1983) was one of Sri Aurobindo's senior disciples, and wrote extensively on philosophy, mysticism, and spiritual evolution based on the teaching of Sri Aurobindo and "The Mother".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |title=Sri Aurobindo: A Contemporary Reade |author=Sachidananda Mohanty|edition= 1  |year= 2008 |publisher= routeledge |location= New Delhi |isbn= 978-0-415-46093-4 |page= 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pavitra]] (1894–1969) was one of their early disciples. Born as Philippe Barbier Saint-Hilaire in Paris. Pavitra left some very interesting memoirs of his conversations with them in 1925 and 1926, which were published as ''Conversations avec Pavitra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |title=Mother's Agenda |author=Satprem|edition= 3 |volume=6 |year= 1965 |publisher= Inst. de Recherches Évolutives |location= Paris |isbn= 0-938710-12-5 |page= 188}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nirodbaran]] (1903–2006). A doctor who obtained his medical degree from Edinburgh, his long and voluminous correspondence with Sri Aurobindo elaborate on many aspects of Integral Yoga and fastidious record of conversations bring out Sri Aurobindo's thought on numerous subjects.{{sfnp|Nirodbaran|1973|pp=1–19|ps=}}
* [[M. P. Pandit]] (1918–1993). Secretary to "The Mother" and the ashram, his copious writings and lectures cover Yoga, the Vedas, Tantra, Sri Aubindo's epic "Savitri" and others.
* [[Dilipkumar Roy]] (1897–1980) was a Bengali Indian musician, musicologist, novelist, poet and essayist.
* [[Satprem]] (1923–2007) was a French author and an important disciple of "The Mother" who published [[Mother's Agenda|''Mother's Agenda (1982)'']], ''Sri Aurobindo or the Adventure of Consciousness'' (2000), ''On the Way to Supermanhood'' (2002) and more.{{sfnp|Satprem|1982|p=5|ps=}}
* [[Indra Sen]] (1903–1994) was another disciple of Sri Aurobindo who, although little-known in the West, was the first to articulate [[integral psychology]] and integral philosophy, in the 1940s and 1950s. A compilation of his papers came out under the title, ''Integral Psychology'' in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;K. Satchidanandan, ''Who's who of Indian Writers: supplementary volume'', 1990 New Delhi : Sahitya Akademi, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Margaret Woodrow Wilson]] (''Nistha'') (1886–1944), daughter of US President [[Woodrow Wilson]], she came to the ashram in 1940 and stayed there until her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=wZJMF1LD7PcC&amp;dat=19440214&amp;printsec=frontpage&amp;hl=en|title=Woodrow Wilson Daughter Dead|date=February 14, 1944|work=[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]]|accessdate=16 November 2015|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critics ===
* [[Adi Da]] finds that Sri Aurobindo's contributions were merely literary and cultural and had extended his political motivation into spirituality and human evolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beezone.com/DawnHorse/aurobindo.htm|title=Bubba Free John in India|date=4 August 1974|work=The Dawn Horse Magazine|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[N. R. Malkani]] finds Sri Aurobindo's theory of creation to be false, as the theory talks about experiences and visions which are beyond normal human experiences. He says the theory is an intellectual response to a difficult problem and that Sri Aurobindo uses the trait of unpredictability in theorising and discussing things not based upon the truth of existence. Malkani says that awareness is already a reality and suggests there would be no need to examine the creative activity subjected to awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sri Aurobindo's theory of evolution&amp;nbsp;– a criticism by Prof. Malkani examined |url=http://www.drkcv.org/Books/kcv4chap_6.htm |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ken Wilber|Wilber's]] interpretation of Sri Aurobindo's philosophy differed from the notion of dividing reality as a different level of matter, life, mind, overmind, supermind proposed by Sri Aurobindo in ''The Life Divine'', and terms them as higher- or lower-nested [[holon (philosophy)|holons]] and states that there is only a fourfold reality (a system of reality created by himself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilber's Critique of Sri Aurobindo |url=http://www.kheper.net/topics/Wilber/Wilber_on_Aurobindo.html |accessdate=2014-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tony Tooke''' was the Chief of the [[United States Forest Service]] for a little over six months, from September 1, 2017, until he announced his retirement on March 7, 2018 due to numerous sexual misconduct allegations over his four decades of employment in numerous positions for the Forest Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/tony-tooke-head-of-u-s-forest-service-stepping-down-amid-sexual-misconduct-allegations|title=Tony Tooke, head of U.S. Forest Service, stepping down amid sexual misconduct allegations|website=PBS NewsHour|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==
Tony Tooke began his career in the U.S. Forest Service in 1980, at the age of 18, on the [[United States National Forest|National Forests]] in [[Mississippi]]. In 1993 he became a Forest Service line officer. His field experience includes assignments as a "Timber Management Assistant", a position usually responsible for the execution of a program to produce a specified amount of timber each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supervisory Forester - Timber Management Assistant|url=https://www.warnell.uga.edu/supervisory-forester-timber-management-assistant|publisher=[[University of Georgia]]|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His next career steps included being an "Other Resource Assistant", and a Silviculturalist (an individual who is responsible for timber harvesting and reforestation plans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silviculturalist|url=https://www.warnell.uga.edu/silviculturalist|publisher=[[University of Georgia]]|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually became a Forester on six Ranger Districts, including districts in [[Kentucky]] and Mississippi, managing the growth of different trees and monitoring their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Service Careers|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/working-with-us/jobs/careers|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there he moved on to become District Ranger&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=lGwG2xuIDMs|title="District Ranger in the US Forest Service, Shasta-Trinity NF"}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Talladega National Forest]] in [[Alabama]], the [[Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest|Oconee National Forest]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and the [[DeSoto National Forest]] in Mississippi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agency Organization|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/about-agency/organization|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, he served as Deputy Forest Supervisor for the National Forests in [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="Forest"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Director Chosen for Forest Service Ecosystem Management|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/news/releases/new-director-chosen-forest-service-ecosystem-management|date=8 December 2009|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, Tony Tooke also held increasingly senior positions in the [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]]’s [[Washington (state)|Washington]] Office (WO). In September of that year, he took over the position of Assistant Director for Forest Management. In this function, he became closely acquainted with questions of [[Restoration ecology|ecological restoration]], [[climate change]], and integrative vegetation management. Since March 2009, he served as Deputy Director for Economic Recovery. In December 2009, he became the Director for Ecosystem Management Coordination, where it was his job to manage the lands and resources of the National Forest System.&lt;ref name="Forest" /&gt;

His last position in [[Washington, D.C.]], before becoming Service Chief, was Associate Deputy Chief for the National Forest System. In this capacity, he oversaw numerous work areas of the Forest Service, including the Lands and Realties the agency has been entrusted with, but also less obvious aspects such as Minerals and Geology. Furthermore, his obligations included the oversight of cooperation efforts with state rural development councils through the [[National Partnership Office]] as well as the coordination of ecosystems management and the Forest Service’s efforts for the conservation of wilderness areas and wild scenic rivers. In addition, he also was responsible for oversight of bureaucratic necessities such as Business Administration and Support Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Secretary Perdue Announces Tony Tooke as New Forest Service Chief|url=https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2017/08/21/secretary-perdue-announces-tony-tooke-new-forest-service-chief|date=21 August 2017|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Associate Deputy Chief, Tooke was also in charge of the Forest Service’s programs for [[Environmental Justice]] and the implementation of the [[Agricultural Act of 2014|2014 Agricultural Act]], commonly known as the "Farm Bill", which helps the Forest Service to accomplish some of its core missions, such as ecological restoration and reducing risks of wildland fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Farm Bill|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/managing-land/farm-bill|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another facet of Tony Tooke’s work was to implement the Forest Service’s strategy to improve the agency’s awareness of the state of its inventory, as well as the work of its usually widely dispersed employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Directives for Inventory, Monitoring, and Assessment|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/emc/rig/directives.shtml|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the implementation of a new planning rule for the National Forest System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the U. S. Forest Service Planning Rule Revision!|url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/planningrule|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Tooke's assignment in the WO, he became Regional Forester for the [[United States Forest Service#Regions|Forest Service’s Southern Region]], also known as Region 8, headquartered in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, GA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regional Forester, Southern Region, USDA Forest Service |url=https://serppas.org/media/1043/serppas_bio_tony-tooke.pdf |format=PDF|publisher=Southeast Regional Partnership for Planning and Sustainability|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Regional Office manages forests and lands of 13 States as well as [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Forests of the South |url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/r8|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ceremony at [[White Mountain National Forest]] on 2 September 2017, Tooke took an oath of office from the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|U.S. Secretary of Agriculture]], [[Sonny Perdue]], thereby making Tooke the 18th Chief of the U.S. Forest Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VIDEO: Secretary Perdue Administers Oath to Tony Tooke as New Forest Service Chief|url=https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2017/09/02/video-secretary-perdue-administers-oath-tony-tooke-new-forest|date=2 September 2017|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor of New Hampshire|New Hampshire's Governor]], [[Chris Sununu]], and members of the US Forest Service also attended the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=eLxCT5YKKO4|title="Secretary Perdue Administers Oath to Tony Tooke as New Forest Service Chief"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tooke succeeded the longtime Chief of the Forest Service [[Thomas Tidwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Forest Service Chief Tony Tooke should continue Chief Tidwell’s collaborative legacy on forests|url=http://wilderness.org/press-release/new-forest-service-chief-tony-tooke-should-continue-chief-tidwell%E2%80%99s-collaborative-legacy-forests|date=August 21, 2017|publisher=[[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]] |accessdate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new Chief took over an agency that oversees 154 national forests, as well as 20 grasslands in 43 states and Puerto Rico. One of his premier tasks will be to lead the fight against [[Wildfire|wildland fires]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House muddles through EPA-Interior amendments|url=http://wilderness.org/press-release/new-forest-service-chief-tony-tooke-should-continue-chief-tidwell%E2%80%99s-collaborative-legacy-forests|date=September 8, 2017|publisher=[[Politico]]|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consume more than half of the Forest Services financial resources, topping $2 billion in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cost of fighting U.S. wildfires topped $2 billion in 2017|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-wildfires/cost-of-fighting-u-s-wildfires-topped-2-billion-in-2017-idUSKCN1BQ01F|date=September 15, 2017|publisher=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency, as Tooke said in a statement in September 2017, also appreciates the help it receives from Congress to develop more effective tools for [[firefighting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Energy 202: Hurricanes are dominating the news.

On March 2, 2018, the U.S. Forest Service confirmed that the United States Department of Agriculture has "engaged an independent investigator" to evaluate claims of sexual misconduct against Tooke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/08/591807164/u-s-forest-service-chief-resigns-amid-sexual-misconduct-allegations|title=U.S. Forest Service Chief Resigns Amid Sexual Misconduct Allegations|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-03-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tooke announced his immediate retirement on March 7, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/03/07/forest-service-chief-resigns-misconduct-allegations-395048|title=Forest Service chief resigns in wake of sexual misconduct allegations|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Spinoza Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.jpg|thumb|''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus'']]
Written by the Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]], the '''''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus''''' ('''''TTP''''') or '''''Theologico-Political Treatise''''' was one of the most controversial texts of the [[early modern period]]. It was a preemptive defense{{clarify-inline|date=August 2017}} of Spinoza's later work, ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', published posthumously in 1677, for which he anticipated harsh criticism.

==Historical context==
{{Main|Dutch Golden Age}}

==Publication history==
The treatise was published anonymously in 1670 by Jan Rieuwertsz in Amsterdam. In order to protect the author and publisher from political retribution, the title page identified the city of publication as Hamburg and the publisher as Henricus Kunraht. It was written in [[New Latin]] rather than the vernacular Dutch in an attempt to avoid [[censorship]] by the secular Dutch authorities.

== Treatment of religion ==
In the treatise, Spinoza put forth his most systematic critique of Judaism, and all organized religion in general. Spinoza argued that theology and philosophy must be kept separate, particularly in the reading of [[scripture]]. Whereas the goal of theology is obedience, philosophy aims at understanding rational truth. Scripture does not teach philosophy and thus cannot be made to conform with it, otherwise the meaning of scripture will be distorted. Conversely, if reason is made subservient to scripture, then, Spinoza argues, "the [[prejudice]]s of a common people of long ago... will gain a hold on his understanding and darken it."

He reinterpreted the belief that there were such things as prophecy, miracles, or supernatural occurrences.(See [[Miracle#Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's views on miracles]]) He argued that God acts solely by the laws of "''his own nature''". He rejected the view that God had a particular [[eschatology|end game or purpose]] to advance in the course of events: to Spinoza, those who believed so were only creating a [[delusion]] for themselves out of [[fear]].

== Scriptural interpretation ==
Spinoza was not only the real father of modern [[metaphysics]] and [[ethics|moral]] and [[political philosophy]], but also of the so-called higher criticism of the Bible. He was particularly attuned to the idea of [[exegesis|interpretation]]; he felt that all organized religion was simply the institutionalized defense of particular interpretations. He rejected in its entirety the view that [[Moses]] composed the first five books of the Bible, called the Pentateuch by Christians or [[Torah]] by Jews. He provided an analysis of the structure of the Bible which demonstrated that it was essentially a compiled text with many different authors and diverse origins; in his view, it was not "revealed" all at once.

His ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus'' undertook to show that [[Scriptures]] properly understood gave no authority for the militant intolerance of the clergy who sought to stifle all dissent by the use of force. To achieve his object, Spinoza had to show what is meant by a proper understanding of the Bible. And this gave him occasion to apply criticism to the Bible. To appreciate his services in this connection it must be remembered that his age was remarkably lacking in historical sense, especially in matters relating to religion. Saintly contemporaries like [[John Bunyan]] and [[Manasseh ben Israel]] made the most fantastic use of Scripture texts; while militant clerics, relying on the ignorant [[bibliolatry]] of the masses, misapplied Bible texts to gain their ends. Spinoza, who permitted no supernatural rival to [[Nature]] and no rival authority to the civil government of the state, rejected also all claims that Biblical literature should be treated in a manner entirely different from that in which any other document is treated that claims to be historical. His contention that the Bible "is in parts imperfect, corrupt, erroneous, and inconsistent with itself, and that we possess but fragments of it"&lt;ref&gt;[[:s:Theologico-Political Treatise 1862/Chapter 12|''Theologico-Political Treatise'', Ch. 12]]; cf. also [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/989 ''Theologico-Political Treatise''], [[Project Gutenberg]] eText.&lt;/ref&gt; roused great storm at the time, and was mainly responsible for his evil repute for a century at least.&lt;ref name="EBr1"&gt;For this section cf. espec. {{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Spinoza, Baruch |volume=25 |pages=687–691 |first=Andrew Seth |last=Pringle-Pattison}} — see also A. Wolf's, "Spinoza, the Man and His Thought", 1933; [[Antonio Damasio]], ''Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain'', William Heinemann, 2003, esp. ch. 6, 224–261; [[Richard McKeon]], ''The Philosophy of Spinoza: The Unity of His Thought'', Ox Bow Pr., 1928; Ray Monk &amp; Frederic Raphael, ''The Great Philosophers''. Phoenix, 2000, ''s.v.'' "Spinoza", pp. 135–174.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many have gradually adopted his views, agreeing with him that the real "word of God", or true religion, is not something written in books but "inscribed on the heart and mind of man".&lt;ref name="Corr"&gt;Cf. ''The correspondence of Spinoza'', G. Allen &amp; Unwin ltd., 1928, p. 289. See also John Laird, [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3745691?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102024689277 ''Journal of Philosophical Studies''], Vol. 3, No. 12 (Oct., 1928), pp. 544–545.&lt;/ref&gt; And many scholars and ministers of religion now praise Spinoza's services in the correct interpretation of Scripture as a document of first rate importance in the progressive development of human thought and conduct.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

== Treatment of Judaism ==
The treatise also rejected the Jewish notion of "[[Jews as the chosen people|chosenness]]"; to Spinoza, all peoples are on par with each other, as God has not elevated one over the other. Spinoza also offered a [[sociology|sociological]] explanation as to how the Jewish people had managed to survive for so long, despite facing relentless persecution. In his view, the Jews had been preserved due to a combination of [[Gentile]] hatred and Jewish [[separatism]].

He also gave one final, crucial reason for the continued Jewish presence, which in his view, was by itself sufficient to maintain the survival of the nation forever: [[circumcision]]. It was the ultimate [[anthropology|anthropological]] expression of bodily marking, a tangible symbol of separateness which was the ultimate identifier.

Spinoza also posited a novel view of the Torah; he claimed that it was essentially a political constitution of the [[Ancient Israel|ancient state of Israel]]. In his view, because the state no longer existed, its constitution could no longer be valid. He argued that the Torah was thus suited to a particular time and place; because times and circumstances had changed, the Torah could no longer be regarded as a valid document.

== Spinoza's political theory ==
Spinoza agreed with [[Thomas Hobbes]] that if each man had to fend for himself, with nothing but his own right arm to rely upon, then the life of man would be "nasty, brutish, and short".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Hobbes]], [[:s:Leviathan/The First Part|''Leviathan'', Chapter XIII: "Of the Natural Condition of Mankind as Concerning Their Felicity and Misery The truly human"]]&lt;/ref&gt; The truly human life is only possible in an organised community, that is, a [[State (polity)|state]] or [[commonwealth]]. The state ensures security of life, limb and property; it brings within reach of every individual many necessaries of life which he could not produce by himself; and it sets free sufficient time and energy for the higher development of human powers. Now the existence of a state  depends upon a kind of implicit agreement on the part of its members or citizens to obey the sovereign authority which governs it. In a state no one can be allowed to do just as he pleases. Every citizen is obliged to obey its laws; and he is not free even to interpret the laws in a special manner. This looks at first like a loss of freedom on the part of the individuals, and the establishment of an absolute power over them. Yet that is not really so. In the first place, without the advantages of an organised state the average individual would be so subject to dangers and hardships of all kinds and to his own passions that he could not be called free in any real sense of the term, least of all in the sense that Spinoza used it. Man needs the state not only to save him from others but also from his own lower impulses and to enable him to live a life of reason, which alone is truly human. In the second place, state sovereignty is never really absolute. It is true that almost any kind of government is better than none, so that it is worth while bearing much that is irksome rather than disturb the peace. But a reasonably wise government will even in its own interest endeavour to secure the good will and cooperation of its citizens by refraining from unreasonable measures, and will permit or even encourage its citizens to advocate reforms, provided they employ peaceable means. In this way the state really rests, in the last resort, on the united will of the citizens, on what [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who read Spinoza, subsequently called the "[[general will]]".&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

Spinoza sometimes writes as if the state upheld absolute sovereignty. But that is due mainly to his determined opposition to every kind of ecclesiastical control over it. Though he is prepared to support what may be called a state religion, as a kind of spiritual cement, yet his account of this religion is such as to make it acceptable to the adherents of any one of the historic creeds, to [[deism|deists]], [[pantheism|pantheists]] and all others, provided they are not fanatical believers or unbelievers. It is really in the interest of freedom of thought and speech that Spinoza would entrust the civil government with something approaching absolute sovereignty in order to effectively resist the tyranny of the militant churches.&lt;ref name="Corr"/&gt;

===Human power consists in strength of mind and intellect===
One of the most striking features in Spinoza's political theory is his basic principle that "right is might." This principle he applied systematically to the whole problem of government, and seemed rather pleased with his achievement, inasmuch as it enabled him to treat political theory in a scientific spirit, as if he were dealing with [[applied mathematics]]. The identification or correlation of right with power has caused much misunderstanding. People supposed that Spinoza reduced justice to brute force. But Spinoza was very far from approving ''[[Realpolitik]]''. In the philosophy of Spinoza the term "power" (as should be clear from his [[moral philosophy]]) means a great deal more than physical force. In a passage near the end of his ''Political Treatise'' he states explicitly that "human power chiefly consists in strength of mind and intellect" — it consists in fact, of all the human capacities and aptitudes, especially the highest of them. Conceived correctly, Spinoza's whole philosophy leaves ample scope for ideal motives in the life of the individual and of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[:s:Theologico-Political Treatise 1862/Chapter 20|''Theologico-Political Treatise'', Ch. 20]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy===
Spinoza discusses the principal kinds of states, or the main types of government, namely, [[Monarchy]], [[Aristocracy]], and [[Democracy]]. Each has its own peculiarities and needs special safeguards, if it is to realise the primary function of a state. Monarchy may degenerate into [[Tyranny]] unless it is subjected to various constitutional checks which will prevent any attempt at [[autocracy]]. Similarly, Aristocracy may degenerate into [[Oligarchy]] and needs analogous checks. On the whole, Spinoza favours Democracy, by which he meant any kind of representative government. In the case of Democracy the community and the government are more nearly identical than in the case of Monarchy or Aristocracy; consequently a democracy is least likely to experience frequent collisions between the people and the government and so is best adapted to secure and maintain that peace, which it is the business of the state to secure.&lt;ref name="EBr1"/&gt;

It is unlikely that Spinoza's ''Tractatus'' ever had political support of any kind, with attempts being made to suppress it even before Dutch magistrate [[Johan de Witt]]'s murder in 1672. In 1673, it was publicly condemned by the [[Synod of Dort|Synod of Dordrecht (1673)]] and banned officially the following year.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Harsh criticism of the TTP began to appear almost as soon as it was published. One of the first, and most notorious, critiques was by Leipzig professor [[Jakob Thomasius]] in 1670.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Nadler, A Book Forged in Hell: Spinoza's Scandalous Treatise and the Birth of the Secular Age. Princeton UP, 2011, p231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Naturalism and its political dangers: Jakob Thomasius against Spinoza's Theological-Political Treatise. A study and the translation of Thomasius’ text[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0268117X.2018.1487876?journalCode=rsev20]&lt;/ref&gt;
The British philosopher [[G. E. Moore]] suggested to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] that he title one of his works "[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]" as a homage to Spinoza's treatise.&lt;ref&gt;Nils-Eric Sahlin, ''The Philosophy of F. P. Ramsey'' (1990), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Umberto Eco''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|OMRI]]}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|k|oʊ}}; {{IPA-it|umˈbɛrto ˈɛːko|lang}}; 5 January 1932 – 19 February 2016) was an Italian novelist, [[Literary criticism|literary critic]], [[philosopher]], [[semiotics|semiotician]], and university professor. He is best known internationally for his 1980 novel ''Il nome della rosa'' (''[[The Name of the Rose]]''), a [[historical mystery]] combining [[semiotics]] in [[fiction]] with [[bible|biblical]] analysis, medieval studies, and [[literary theory]]. He later wrote other novels, including ''Il pendolo di Foucault'' (''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'') and ''L'isola del giorno prima'' (''[[The Island of the Day Before]]''). His novel ''Il cimitero di Praga'' (''[[The Prague Cemetery]]''), released in 2010, topped the bestseller charts in Italy.&lt;ref name="Thomson 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Thomson | first=Ian | title=Umberto Eco obituary | website=the Guardian | date=20 Feb 2016 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/20/umberto-eco-obituary | accessdate=1 Mar 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco also wrote academic texts, [[children's books]], and [[essays]]. He was the founder of the Department of [[media studies|Media Studies]] at the [[University of the Republic of San Marino]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/73952754-d7f3-11e5-98fd-06d75973fe09?mhq5j=e3|title=Umberto Eco, academic, novelist and journalist, 1932–2016|website=Financial Times|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; president of the Graduate School for the Study of the Humanities at the [[University of Bologna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/20/umberto-eco-1932-2016|title=Umberto Eco, 1932–2016|last=France-Presse|first=Agence|date=2016-02-19|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-29|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; member of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]], and an honorary [[fellow]] of [[Kellogg College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kellogg.ox.ac.uk/discover/news/honorary-fellow-umberto-eco-dies/|title=Honorary Fellow Umberto Eco dies {{!}} Kellogg College|website=www.kellogg.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco was honored with the ''[[Kenyon Review]]'' Award for Literary Achievement in 2005 along with [[Roger Angell]].&lt;ref name=kenyon&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Angell and Umberto Eco|url=http://www.kenyonreview.org/programs/kenyon-review-award-for-literary-achievement/roger-angell-and-umberto-eco/|publisher=The Kenyon Review|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Eco was born in the city of [[Alessandria]], in [[Piedmont]] in northern Italy, and here he attended high school. His father, Giulio, one of thirteen children, was an accountant before the government called him to serve in three wars. During [[World War II]], Umberto and his mother, Giovanna (Bisio), moved to a small village in the Piedmontese mountainside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/umberto-eco|title=Umberto Eco Biography|work=eNotes |accessdate=23 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eco received a [[Salesian]] education and made references to the order and its founder in his works and interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.sdb.ph/sdb4/N7/20040644ENG.doc|title=Don Bosco in Umberto Eco's latest book|journal=N7: News publication for the Salesian community|page=4|date=June 2004|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306042413/http://www.sdb.ph/sdb4/N7/20040644ENG.doc |archivedate=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family name is supposedly an acronym of ''ex caelis oblatus'' (from Latin: a gift from the heavens), which was given to his grandfather (a [[Child abandonment|foundling]]) by a city official.

Umberto's father urged him to become a lawyer, but he entered the [[University of Turin]] to take up medieval philosophy and literature, writing his thesis on [[Thomas Aquinas]] and earning a [[Laurea#Former status of the Laurea degree|Laurea degree]] in [[philosophy]] in 1954. During his university studies, Eco stopped believing in God and left the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="Time05"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1069054-2,00.html |first=Jeff |last=Israely |title=A Resounding Eco |newspaper=Time |date=5 June 2005 |accessdate=1 June 2007 |quote=His new book touches on politics, but also on faith.

A group of [[avant-garde]] artists, painters, musicians and writers, whom he had befriended at RAI (Gruppo 63), became an important and influential component in Eco's writing career. This was especially true after the publication of his first book in 1956, ''Il problema estetico in San Tommaso'', which was an extension of his Laurea thesis. This also marked the beginning of his lecturing career at his [[alma mater]].

In September 1962 he married Renate Ramge, a German art teacher with whom he had a son and a daughter.

He divided his time between an apartment in [[Milan]] and a vacation house near [[Urbino]]. He had a 30,000 volume [[library]] in the former and a 20,000 volume library in the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3642577/Heavyweight-champion.html|title=Heavyweight champion|accessdate=23 October 2009|last=Farndale|first=Nigel|date=24 May 2005|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a visiting professor at [[Columbia University]] several times in the 1980s and 1990s. In 1992–1993 Eco was the Norton professor at [[Harvard University]]. On 8 May 1993, Eco received an honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] (D.H.L.) from [[Indiana University Bloomington]] in recognition of his over fifteen-year association with the university's Research Center for Language and Semiotic Studies. Six books that were authored, co-authored, or co-edited by Eco were published by  [[Indiana University Press]]. In 1996, he was appointed Honorary Doctor of Philosophy of the [[University of Tartu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ut.ee/en/university/structure-and-staff/honorary-doctors Honorary Doctors of the University of Tartu]&lt;/ref&gt; He frequently collaborated with his friend [[Thomas Sebeok]], semiotician and Distinguished Professor of Linguistics at Indiana University. He became [[Satrap]] of the Collège de 'Pataphysique in 2001. On 23 May 2002, Eco received an honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] (D.Litt.) from [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], [[New Jersey]]. In 2009, the [[University of Belgrade]] in Serbia awarded him an [[honorary doctorate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bg.ac.rs/csrp/nauka/pocasni_doktori.php|publisher=University of Belgrade|title=Honorary Doctors|location=Serbia|accessdate=11 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503231449/http://www.bg.ac.rs/csrp/nauka/pocasni_doktori.php |archivedate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eco was a member of the Italian skeptic organization ''Comitato Italiano per il Controllo delle Affermazioni sulle Pseudoscienze'' (Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences) [[CICAP]].&lt;ref name="GuardianNaples2005"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/06/worlddispatch.italy|title=No blood, sweat or tears|first=Barbara|last=McMahon|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 October 2005|accessdate=28 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional and academic activity==

===Studies on medieval aesthetics===
In 1959 Eco published his second book, ''Sviluppo dell'estetica medievale'' (''The Development of Medieval Aesthetics''), on [[medieval philosophy]]. After 18 months' military service in the [[Italian Army]], he left RAI in 1959 to become the senior non-fiction editor of the [[Bompiani]] publishing house in Milan, a position he occupied until 1975.

===Literary criticism===
Eco began seriously developing his ideas on the "open" text and on semiotics, writing many essays on these subjects, and in 1962 he published ''Opera aperta'' (translated into English as "The Open Work"). In it, Eco argued that literary texts are fields of meaning, rather than strings of meaning; and that they are understood as open, internally dynamic and psychologically engaged fields. Literature which limits one's potential understanding to a single, unequivocal line, the ''closed text'', remains the least rewarding, while texts that are the most active between mind, society and life ([[open text]]s) are the liveliest and best—although valuation terminology was not his primary focus. Eco came to these positions through study of language and from semiotics, rather than from psychology or historical analysis (as did theorists such as [[Wolfgang Iser]], on the one hand, and [[Hans Robert Jauss]], on the other).

===Studies on media culture===
Eco's short 1961 essay "Fenomenologia di Mike Bongiorno" ("Phenomenology of [[Mike Bongiorno]]", on the most popular [[quiz show]] host in Italy) received much notoriety among the general public and has drawn endless questions by journalists at every public appearance by Eco; the essay was later included in the collection ''Diario minimo'' (1963). His book ''Apocalittici e integrati'' (1964) analyzes the phenomenon of mass communication from a sociological perspective.

In 1967 he gave the influential&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strangelove|first=Michael|date=2005|title=The Empire of Mind: Digital Piracy and the Anti-Capitalist Movement|publisher=University of Toronto Press|pages=104–5|isbn=0802038182}}&lt;/ref&gt; lecture "Towards a Semiological Guerrilla Warfare", which coined the influential term "[[semiological guerrilla]]", and influenced the theorization of guerrilla tactics against [[mainstream]] [[mass media culture]], such as [[guerrilla television]] and [[culture jamming]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Among the expressions used in the essay are "communications guerrilla warfare" and "cultural guerrilla".&lt;ref name="Eco67Guerrilla"&gt;Eco (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bondanella05"&gt;Bondanella (2005) pp. 53, 88–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The essay was later included in Eco's book ''[[Faith in Fakes]]''.

In 2012, Eco and [[Jean-Claude Carrière]] published a book of conversations on the future of information carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/27/end-book-eco-carriere-review|title=This is Not the End of the Book by Umberto Eco and Jean-Claude Carrière – review|last=Clee|first=Nicholas|date=27 May 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eco criticized social networks, saying for example that ''"Social media gives legions of idiots the right to speak when they once only spoke at a bar after a glass of wine, without harming the community [...] but now they have the same right to speak as a Nobel Prize winner. It's the invasion of the idiots."''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://comipi.wordpress.com/2015/06/18/the-invasion-of-the-idiots-and-modern-churnalism/|title=About idiots and churnalism|last=fveltri|website=News of PR Interest|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2015/06/10/cultura/eco-con-i-parola-a-legioni-di-imbecilli-XJrvezBN4XOoyo0h98EfiJ/pagina.html|title=Umberto Eco: 'Con i social parola a legioni di imbecilli'|website=LaStampa.it|access-date=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semiotics===
[[File:Umberto Eco 04.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Umberto Eco in 2005]]
Eco founded and developed one of the most important approaches in contemporary semiotics, usually referred to as interpretative semiotics. The main books in which he elaborates his theory are ''La struttura assente'' (1968; literally: ''The Absent Structure''), ''A Theory of Semiotics'' (1975), ''The Role of the Reader'' (1979), ''Semiotics and Philosophy of Language'' (1984), ''The Limits of Interpretation'' (1990), ''[[Kant and the Platypus]]'' (1997), and ''From the Tree to the Labyrinth: Historical Studies on the Sign and Interpretation'' (2014).

Eco co-founded ''[[Versus (journal)|Versus: Quaderni di studi semiotici]]'' (known as ''VS ''among Italian academics), a semiotic journal. ''VS'' is used by scholars whose work is related to signs and signification. The journal's foundation and activities have contributed to semiotics as an academic field in its own right, both in Italy and in the rest of Europe. Most of the well-known European semioticians, including Eco, [[A. J. Greimas]], Jean-Marie Floch, and [[Jacques Fontanille]], as well as philosophers and linguists like [[John Searle]] and [[George Lakoff]], have published original articles in ''VS''. His work with Serbian and Russian scholars and writers included thought on [[Milorad Pavić]] and a meeting with [[Alexander Genis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Genis|first1=Daniel|title=Driving Umberto Eco|url=http://airshipdaily.com/blog/10172014-umberto-eco-writer-writing|website=www.airshipdaily.com|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anthropology===
In 1988, at the University of Bologna, Eco created an unusual program called ''Anthropology of the West'' from the perspective of non-Westerners (African and Chinese scholars), as defined by their own criteria. Eco developed this transcultural international network based on the idea of [[Alain le Pichon]] in [[West Africa]]. The Bologna program resulted in the first conference in [[Guangzhou, China]], in 1991 entitled "Frontiers of Knowledge". The first event was soon followed by an Itinerant Euro-Chinese seminar on "Misunderstandings in the Quest for the Universal" along the silk trade route from [[Guangzhou]] to Beijing. The latter culminated in a book entitled ''The Unicorn and the Dragon'',&lt;ref&gt;''The Unicorn and the Dragon'', Le Pichon, Alain; Yue Dayun (eds.) (1996), Beijing University Press. (bilingual French/English edition)&lt;/ref&gt; which discussed the question of the creation of knowledge in China and in Europe. Scholars contributing to this volume were from China, including [[Tang Yijie]], Wang Bin and Yue Daiyun, as well as from Europe: Furio Colombo, [[Antoine Danchin]], [[Jacques Le Goff]], [[Paolo Fabbri]] and [[Alain Rey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://carbon.ucdenver.edu/~mryder/itc/eco/intro.html |title=A Conversation on Information |type=interview |first=Patrick |last=Coppock |date=February 1995 |accessdate=9 June 2010 |publisher=UC |place=Denver |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609064331/http://carbon.ucdenver.edu/~mryder/itc/eco/intro.html |archivedate=9 June 2010 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 a seminar in [[Timbuktu]], [[Mali]], was followed up with another gathering in Bologna to reflect on the conditions of reciprocal knowledge between East and West. This, in turn, gave rise to a series of conferences in [[Brussels]], [[Paris]] and [[Goa]], culminating in Beijing in 2007. The topics of the Beijing conference were "Order and Disorder", "New Concepts of War and Peace", "Human Rights" and "Social Justice and Harmony". Eco presented the opening lecture. Among those giving presentations were anthropologists Balveer Arora, Varun Sahni, and [[Rukmini Bhaya Nair]] from India, Moussa Sow from Africa, Roland Marti and [[Maurice Olender]] from Europe, Cha Insuk from Korea, and Huang Ping and Zhao Tinyang from China. Also on the program were scholars from the fields of law and science including [[Antoine Danchin]], Ahmed Djebbar and Dieter Grimm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/665/bo3.htm |title=Vegetal and mineral memory |date=November 2003 |accessdate=1 February 2007 |publisher=Ahgram |place=EG |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040201224219/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/665/bo3.htm |archivedate=1 February 2004 |deadurl=yes}} Considers, among other things, [[encyclopedia]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; Eco's interest in East-West dialogue to facilitate international communication and understanding also correlates with his related interest in the international auxiliary language [[Esperanto]].

==Style and works==

===Themes===
Eco's fiction has enjoyed a wide audience around the world, with many translations. His novels are full of subtle, often multilingual, references to literature and history. Eco's work illustrates the concept of [[intertextuality]], or the inter-connectedness of all literary works. Eco cited [[James Joyce]] and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] as the two modern authors who have influenced his work the most.&lt;ref&gt;Eco (2006) ''On Literature'' Vintage&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selected narrative works===
Eco employed his education as a medievalist in his first novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'' (1980), a historical mystery set in a 14th-century monastery. Franciscan friar [[William of Baskerville]], aided by his assistant Adso, a [[Benedictine]] [[Catholic novitiate|novice]], investigates a series of murders at a monastery that is to host an important religious debate. The novel contains many direct or indirect [[metatextuality|metatextual]] references to other sources, requiring the detective work of the reader to 'solve'. The title is unexplained in the book. As a symbol, the rose is ubiquitous enough not to confer any single meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eco|first=Umberto|title=Reflections on The Name of the Rose|year=1985|publisher=Martin Secker &amp; Warburg Limited|location=London|translator=W. Weaver|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a tribute to [[Jorge Luis Borges]], a major influence on Eco, in the blind monk and librarian Jorge of Burgos: Borges, like the character Jorge, lived a celibate life consecrated to his passion for books, and also went blind in later life. William of Baskerville is a logically-minded Englishman who is a friar and a detective, and his name evokes both [[William of Ockham]] and [[Sherlock Holmes]] (by way of ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]''); several passages describing him are strongly reminiscent of [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s descriptions of Holmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eco|first=Umberto|title=The Name of the Rose|year=1986|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York|isbn=0-446-34410-9|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Arthur Conan|title=Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Novels and Stories Vol 1|year=2003|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|isbn=0-553-21241-9|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying mystery of the murder is borrowed from the "[[Arabian Nights]]". ''The Name of the Rose'' was later made into [[The Name of the Rose (film)|a motion picture]] starring [[Sean Connery]], [[F. Murray Abraham]], [[Christian Slater]] and [[Ron Perlman]], which follows the plot, though not the philosophical and historical themes, of the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/24/movies/film-medieval-mystery-in-name-of-the-rose.html|title=FILM: MEDIEVAL MYSTERY IN 'NAME OF THE ROSE'|last=Canby|first=Vincent|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'' (1988), three under-employed editors who work for a minor publishing house decide to amuse themselves by inventing a conspiracy theory. Their conspiracy, which they call "The Plan", is about an immense and intricate plot to take over the world by a secret order descended from the [[Knights Templar]]. As the game goes on, the three slowly become obsessed with the details of this plan. The game turns dangerous when outsiders learn of The Plan, and believe that the men have really discovered the secret to regaining the lost treasure of the Templars.

''[[The Island of the Day Before]]'' (1994) was Eco's third novel. The book, set in the seventeenth century, is about a man stranded on a ship within sight of an island which he believes is on the other side of the international date-line. The main character is trapped by his inability to swim and instead spends the bulk of the book reminiscing on his life and the adventures that brought him to be stranded.

''[[Baudolino]]'' was published in 2000. Baudolino is a knight who saves the Byzantine historian [[Niketas Choniates]] during the sack of Constantinople in the [[Fourth Crusade]]. Claiming to be an accomplished liar, he confides his history, from his childhood as a peasant lad endowed with a vivid imagination, through his role as adopted son of [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick Barbarossa]], to his mission to visit the mythical realm of [[Prester John]]. Throughout his retelling, Baudolino brags of his ability to swindle and tell tall tales, leaving the historian (and the reader) unsure of just how much of his story was a lie.

''[[The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana]]'' (2005) is about Giambattista Bodoni, an old bookseller specializing in antiques who emerges from a coma with only some memories to recover his past. Bodoni is pressed to make a very difficult choice, one between his past and his future. He must either abandon his past to live his future or regain his past and sacrifice his future.

''[[The Prague Cemetery]]'', Eco's sixth novel, was published in 2010. It is the story of a secret agent who "weaves plots, conspiracies, intrigues and attacks, and helps determine the historical and political fate of the European Continent". The book is a narrative of the rise of Modern-day [[antisemitism]], by way of the [[Dreyfus affair]], ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'' and other important 19th century events which gave rise to hatred and hostility toward the [[Jewish]] people.

''[[Numero Zero]]'' was published in 2015. Set in 1992 and narrated by Colonna, a hack journalist working on a Milan newspaper, it offers a satire of Italy's kickback and bribery culture&lt;ref&gt;Ian Thomson, Evening Standard, 12 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as, among many things, the legacy of [[Fascism]].

'''Zulfikar Ali Bhutto ({{Nastaliq|ذوالفقار علی بھٹو}})''' (5 January 1928 – 4 April 1979) was a [[Pakistani]] politician who served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Pakistan|9th]] [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]] from 1973 to 1977, and prior to that as the [[List of Presidents of Pakistan|4th]] [[President of Pakistan]] from 1971 to 1973. He was also the founder of the [[Pakistan People's Party]] (PPP) and served as its chairman until his execution in 1979.&lt;ref name="PPP"&gt;{{cite web

Educated at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], Bhutto trained as a [[barrister]] at [[Lincoln's Inn]]. He entered [[Pakistani politics|politics]] as one of President [[Iskander Mirza]]'s cabinet members, before being assigned several ministries during President [[Ayub Khan]]'s military rule from 1958. Appointed [[Foreign Minister of Pakistan|Foreign Minister]] in 1963, Bhutto was a proponent of [[Operation Gibraltar]] in [[Kashmir]], leading to [[War of 1965|war with India in 1965]]. After the [[Tashkent Agreement]] ended hostilities, Bhutto fell out with Ayub and was sacked from government. He founded the PPP in 1967, contesting [[Pakistani general election, 1970|general elections]] held by President [[Yahya Khan]] in 1970. While the [[Awami League]] won a majority of seats overall, the PPP won a majority of seats in [[West Pakistan]]; the two parties were unable to agree on a new constitution in particular on the issue of [[Six Point Movement]] which many in West Pakistan saw as a way to break up the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Six-point_Programme&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent uprisings led to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|secession]] of [[Bangladesh]], and Pakistan losing the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|war]] against Bangladesh-allied [[India]] in 1971. Bhutto was handed over the presidency in December 1971 and [[emergency rule]] was imposed. When Bhutto set about rebuilding Pakistan, he stated his intention was to "rebuild confidence and rebuild hope for the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87VnBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA179 | title=The Struggle for Pakistan: A Muslim Homeland and Global Politics| isbn=9780674744998| last1=Jalal| first1=Ayesha| date=2014-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By July 1972, Bhutto had recovered 43,600 [[prisoners of war]] and 5,000 square miles of Indian-held territory after signing the [[Simla Agreement]].&lt;ref name="Sharmila Faruqui"&gt;{{cite web

Despite civil disorder, the PPP won [[Pakistani general election, 1977|parliamentary elections in 1977]] by a wide margin. However, the opposition alleged widespread [[vote rigging]], and violence escalated across the country. On 5 July that same year, Bhutto was deposed by his appointed [[Army Chief of Staff (Pakistan)|army chief]] General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] in a [[military coup]] before being controversially tried and executed by the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]] in 1979 for authorising the murder of a [[Ahmed Raza Kasuri|political opponent]].&lt;ref&gt;Pakistan, Zia and after.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Bhutto remains a contentious figure in [[History of Pakistan|Pakistan's history]], his party, the PPP, remains among Pakistan's largest, his daughter [[Benazir Bhutto]] was twice elected Prime Minister,&lt;ref name="PPP"/&gt; and his son-in-law and Benazir's husband, [[Asif Ali Zardari]], served as President.

==Early life==
{{See also|Bhutto family}}
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto belonged to a [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] family,he was born to Sir [[Shah Nawaz Bhutto]] and Khursheed Begum (née Lakhi Bai) near [[Larkana]]. Zulfikar was their third child—their first one, Sikandar Ali, had died from pneumonia at age seven in 1914, and the second, Imdad Ali, died of [[cirrhosis]] at age 39 in 1953.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bhutto, Zulfikar Ali  |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9079077/Zulfikar-Ali-Bhutto |accessdate=7 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2016}} His father was the ''[[dewan]]'' of the [[princely state]] of [[Junagadh]], and enjoyed an influential relationship with the officials of the [[British Raj]]. As a young boy, Bhutto moved to [[Worli Seaface]] in [[Bombay]] to study at the [[Cathedral and John Connon School]]. He then also became an activist in the [[Pakistan Movement]]. In 1943, his marriage was arranged with Shireen Amir Begum. He later divorced her in 1945, however, in order to remarry.&lt;ref name="Benazir - a profile"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chitkara|first1=M.G.|title=Benazir – a profile|date=1996|publisher=APH Publ.

In 1949, as a sophomore, Bhutto transferred to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he earned a B.A. (honours) degree in political science in 1950.&lt;ref name="PPP"/&gt; There, Bhutto became interested in the theories of socialism, delivering a series of lectures on their feasibility in Islamic countries. During this time, Bhutto's father played a controversial role in the affairs of Junagadh. Coming to power in a palace coup, he secured the accession of his state to Pakistan, which was ultimately negated by Indian intervention in December 1947.&lt;ref name="RJ"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gandhi | first = Rajmohan | authorlink = Rajmohan Gandhi | year = 1991 | title = Patel: A Life | publisher = Navajivan | location = India | id = ASIN B0006EYQ0A | pages = 291–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1950, Bhutto travelled to the United Kingdom to study law at [[Christ Church, Oxford]] and received an LLB, followed by an LLM degree in law and an M.Sc. (honours) degree in political science.&lt;ref name="PPP"/&gt; Upon finishing his studies, he was called to the bar at [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1953.&lt;ref name="PPP"/&gt; He was fellow of Barrister Ijaz Hussain Batalvi who later appeared in his case as prosecutor.

Bhutto married his second wife, [[Nusrat Bhutto|Nusrat Ispahani]], an Iranian-Kurdish woman,&lt;ref name="Interview with Vali Nasr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.resetdoc.org/EN/Vali-Nasr-Interview.php |title=Interview with Vali Nasr |publisher=Resetdoc.org |accessdate=9 December 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Karachi on 8 September 1951. Their first child, [[Benazir Bhutto|Benazir]], was born in 1953. She was followed by [[Murtaza Bhutto|Murtaza]] in 1954, Sanam in 1957 and [[Shahnawaz Bhutto|Shahnawaz]] in 1958. He accepted the post of lecturer at the [[S. M. Law College]], from where he was also awarded an honorary doctorate in law by college president [[Hassanally A. Rahman]] before establishing himself in a legal practice in Karachi. He also took over the management of his family's estate and business interests after his father's death.

==Political career==
In 1957, Bhutto became the youngest member of Pakistan's delegation to the United Nations. He addressed the [[UN Sixth Committee on Aggression]] that October and led Pakistan's delegation to the first [[UN Conference on the Law of the Sea]] in 1958. That year, Bhutto became Pakistan's youngest cabinet minister, taking up the reins of the [[Ministry of Commerce (Pakistan)|Ministry of Commerce]] by President [[Iskander Mirza]], pre-''[[1958 Pakistani coup d'état|coup d'état]]'' government.&lt;ref name="PPP"/&gt; In 1960, he was promoted to Minister of [[Ministry of Water and Power (Pakistan)|Water and Power]], [[Ministry of Communications of Pakistan|Communications]] and [[Ministry of Industry (Pakistan)|Industry]]. Bhutto became trusted ally and advisor of Ayub Khan, rising in influence and power despite his youth and relative inexperience. Bhutto aided his president in negotiating the [[Indus Water Treaty]] in India in 1960 and next year negotiated an [[Pakistan Oilfields|oil-exploration agreement]] with the Soviet Union, which agreed to provide economic and technical aid to Pakistan.

Bhutto was a [[Pakistani nationalism|Pakistani nationalist]] and socialist,&lt;ref name="Fay Willey with Loren Jenkins"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Willey, Fay  |author2=Jenkins, Loren  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Ghost of Bhutto|url=http://pakteahouse.net/2011/04/07/the-ghost-of-bhutto/|date=16 April 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; with particular views on the type of democracy needed in Pakistan. On becoming foreign minister in 1963, his socialist viewpoint influenced him to embark on a [[One-China policy|close relationship]] with neighbouring China. At the time, many other countries accepted [[Taiwan]] as the legitimate single government of China, at a time when [[Two Chinas|two governments each claimed to be "China"]].&lt;ref name="The Times Group of India"&gt;{{cite news |last=Suraiya |first=Jug |authorlink=Jug Suraiya |date=14 May 2011 |title=Dealing with a Superpower by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto |url=http://www.timesofbombay.com/tag/zulfikar-ali-bhutto/ |work=[[Bombay Times]] |publisher=The Times Group of India |accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the Soviet Union and its [[Soviet bloc|satellite states]] [[Sino-Soviet split|broke off]] relations with Beijing over ideological differences, and only [[Albania]] and Pakistan supported the People's Republic of China. Bhutto staunchly supported Beijing in the UN, and in the [[United Nation Security Council|UNSC]], while also continuing to build bridges to the United States.&lt;ref name="Government of China and Government of Pakistan"&gt;{{Cite video | people =Government Officials | title =Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto speaks in support of China for membership of United Nations |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jzr7cd8jdJw | medium =Television Production | publisher =Government of China and Pakistan Government | location =Beijing, People's Republic of China |year=1962 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutto's strong advocacy of developing ties with China came under criticism from the United States. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] wrote to Bhutto, warning him that further overtures to China would jeopardize congressional support for aid to Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Brands, ''The Foreign Policies of Lyndon Johnson: Beyond Vietnam'', Texas A&amp;M University Press (1999), p.171 {{ISBN|089096873X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutto addressed his speeches in a demagogic style and headed the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)|foreign ministry]] aggressively. His leadership style and his swift rise to power brought him national prominence and popularity. Bhutto and his staff visited Beijing and were warmly received by the Chinese, and Bhutto greeted [[Mao Zedong]] with great respect.&lt;ref name="Government of China and Pakistan"/&gt; There, Bhutto helped Ayub negotiate trade and military agreements with the Chinese regime, which agreed to help Pakistan in several military and industrial projects.&lt;ref name="Government of China and Pakistan"&gt;{{Cite video | people =Government Officials | title =Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's historic visit to China |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OkQnLbGV80 | medium =Television Production | publisher =Government of China and Pakistan | location =Beijing, People's Republic of China |year=1962 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhutto signed the [[Sino-Pakistan Boundary Agreement]] on 2 March 1963 that transferred 750 square kilometres of territory from [[Pakistan-administered Kashmir]] to Chinese control. Bhutto asserted his belief in [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-alignment]], making Pakistan an influential member in non-aligned organisations. Believing in [[Ummah|pan-Islamic unity]], Bhutto developed closer relations with the likes of Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. Bhutto significantly transformed Pakistan's hitherto pro-West foreign policy. While maintaining a prominent role for Pakistan within the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] and the [[Central Treaty Organization]], Bhutto began asserting a foreign policy course for Pakistan that was independent of [[Pakistan–United States relations|U.S. influence]]. Meanwhile, Bhutto visited both [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]] and established a strong link between two countries. Bhutto proceeded economical, technological, industrial and military agreements with Germany. Bhutto strengthened Pakistan's strategic alliance with Germany. Bhutto addressed a farewell speech at the [[University of Munich]], where he cited the importance of Pakistan and German relations.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Bhutto then visited Poland and established diplomatic relations in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hancock | first =Ewa | title =Friendly Relations: Pakistan and Poland | website =Eva Hancock | publisher =Warsaw Voice | date =21 March 2007 |url=http://www.warsawvoice.pl/WVpage/pages/article.php/14298/article | format = JPG | accessdate =25 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutto used [[Pakistan Air Force]]'s [[Brigadier-General]] [[Władysław Turowicz]] to establish the military and economical link between Pakistan and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Pakistan in Europe | publisher =Ministry of Foreign Affairs | date =21 March 2007 |url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/about/hq/record/14th.html | format = JPG | accessdate =25 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutto sought and reached to the [[Polish people in Pakistan|Polish community in Pakistan]] and made a tremendous effort for a fresh avenues for mutual cooperation.

In 1962, as territorial differences increased between India and China, Beijing was planning to stage [[Sino-Indian War|an invasion]] in northern territories of India. Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] and Mao invited Pakistan to join the raid to illegally rest the Indian [[State of Jammu and Kashmir]] from India. Bhutto advocated for the plan, but Ayub opposed the plan: he was afraid of retaliation by Indian troops.&lt;ref name="The Times Group of India"/&gt; Instead Ayub proposed a "joint defence union" with India.  Bhutto was shocked by such statements and felt Ayub Khan was unlettered in international affairs. Bhutto was conscious that despite Pakistan's membership of anti-communist western alliances, China had refrained from criticising Pakistan. In 1962, the U.S. assured Pakistan that “Kashmir issues” will be resolved according to the wishes of Pakistanis and the “Kashmiris”. Therefore, Ayub did not participate in the Chinese plans.&lt;ref name="The Times Group of India"/&gt; Bhutto criticised the U.S. for providing military aid to India during and after the 1962 Sino-Indian War, which was seen as an abrogation of Pakistan's alliance with the United States&lt;ref name="USCS3"&gt;{{cite news| author = US Country Studies|url=http://countrystudies.us/pakistan/18.htm| title = Ayub Khan| format = PHP| accessdate =7 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Ayub Khan, on Bhutto's counsel, launched [[Operation Gibraltar]] in a bid to [[Kashmir conflict|"liberate"]] Kashmir. It ended in a fiasco and the [[Indian Armed Forces]] launched a successful counter-attack on [[West Pakistan]] ([[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]]).&lt;ref name="The Times Group of India"/&gt; This war was an aftermath of brief skirmishes that took place between March and August 1965 on the international boundaries in the [[Rann of Kutch]], Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. Bhutto joined Ayub in Uzbekistan to negotiate a [[Tashkent Declaration|peace treaty]] with the Indian Prime Minister [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]]. Ayub and Shastri agreed to exchange prisoners of war and withdraw respective forces to pre-war boundaries. This agreement was deeply unpopular in Pakistan, causing major political unrest against Ayub's regime. Bhutto's criticism of the final agreement caused a major rift between him and Ayub. Initially denying the rumours, Bhutto resigned in June 1966 and expressed strong opposition to Ayub's regime.&lt;ref name="USCS3" /&gt;

During his term, Bhutto was known to be formulating aggressive geostrategic and foreign policies against India.&lt;ref name="Federation of American Scientists (FAS)"&gt;{{cite web | last =Sublettle | first =Carey | title =Historical Background: Zulfikar Ali Bhutto | website =Nuclear weapons archives | publisher =Federation of American Scientists (FAS) | date =15 October 1965|url=http://www.nuclearweaponarchive.org/Pakistan/PakOrigin.html | accessdate =25 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, Bhutto's friend [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] informed him of the status of [[India and weapons of mass destruction|India's nuclear programme]]. Bhutto reportedly said, "Pakistan will fight, fight for a thousand years. If.. India builds the (atom) bomb.... (Pakistan) will eat grass or (leaves), even go hungry, but we (Pakistan) will get one of our own (atom bomb).... We (Pakistan) have no other Choice!". In his 1969 book ''The Myth of Independence'' Bhutto argued that it was the “necessity” for Pakistan to acquire the fission weapon, and start a so-called deterrence programme to be able to stand up to the industrialised states, and against a nuclear armed India. Bhutto obtained a manifesto and made a future policy on how the programme would be developed and which individual scientists would start the program. Bhutto selected Munir Ahmad Khan and [[Abdus Salam]] (a Nobel laureate and Ahmadi Muslim and despite Bhutto’s constitutional designation in [[Persecution of Ahmadis#Pakistan|Pakistan of Ahmadis as “non-Muslim”]]) that  Ahmaan Ahmadiyuaas the first and main basis of the programme.&lt;ref name="Federation of American Scientists (FAS)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bhutto|Bhutto]], pp. 196–399&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pakistan Peoples Party==
Following his resignation as foreign minister, large crowds gathered to listen to Bhutto's speech upon his arrival in Lahore on 21 June 1967. Tapping a wave of anger against Ayub, Bhutto travelled across Pakistan to deliver political speeches. In October 1966 Bhutto made explicit the beliefs of his new party, "Islam is our faith, democracy is our policy, socialism is our economy. All power to the people."&lt;ref name="USCS2"&gt;{{cite news| author = US Country Studies|url=http://countrystudies.us/pakistan/19.htm| title = Yahya Khan and Bangladesh| format = PHP| accessdate =7 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 November 1967, at the Lahore residence of [[Mubashir Hassan]], a gathering that included Bhutto, Bengali communist [[Jalaludin Abdur Rahim|J. A. Rahim]] and [[Basit Jehangir Sheikh]] founded the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP), establishing a strong base in Punjab, Sindh and amongst the [[Muhajir people|Muhajirs]].&lt;ref name="Professor"&gt;Hassan, Mubashir (2000). ''The Mirage of Power: An Inquiry into the Bhutto Years, 1971–1977''. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-579300-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hassan, an engineering professor at [[UET Lahore]], was the main brain and hidden hand behind the success and the rise of Bhutto. Under Hassan's guidance and Bhutto's leadership, the PPP became a part of the pro-democracy movement involving diverse political parties from all across Pakistan. The PPP activists staged large protests and strikes in different parts of the country, increasing pressure on Ayub to resign. Dr. Hassan and Bhutto's arrest on 12 November 1969, sparked greater political unrest. After his release, Bhutto, joined by key leaders of PPP, attended the Round Table Conference called by Ayub Khan in [[Rawalpindi]], but refused to accept Ayub's continuation in office and the [[East Pakistan|East-Pakistani]] politician [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]]'s [[Six point movement]] for regional autonomy.&lt;ref name="Professor"/&gt;

Following Ayub's resignation, his successor, General [[Yahya Khan]] promised to hold [[Pakistani general election, 1970|parliamentary elections]] on 7 December 1970. Bhutto attracted the leftist and ultra-leftist forces, who gathered under his leadership, becoming the full sum of force. The Socialist-Communist mass, under Bhutto's leadership, intensified its support in Muhajir and poor farming communities in West Pakistan, working through educating people to cast their vote for their better future.&lt;ref name="Professor"/&gt; Gathering and uniting the scattered socialist-marxist mass in one single center was considered Bhutto's greatest political achievements and as its result, the leftist and Bhutto's party won a large number of seats from constituencies in West-Pakistan.&lt;ref name="USCS2" /&gt; However, Sheikh Mujib's [[Awami League]] won an absolute majority in the legislature, receiving more than twice as many votes as Bhutto's PPP. Bhutto refused to accept an Awami League government and famously promised to "''break the legs''" of any elected PPP member who dared to attend the inaugural session of the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]]. Capitalising on West Pakistani fears of East Pakistani separatism, Bhutto demanded that Sheikh Mujib form a coalition with the PPP. Amidst popular outrage in East Pakistan, Sheikh Mujib declared the independence of "Bangladesh". According to historical references and a report published by leading newspaper, "Mujib no longer&lt;ref name="The Nation"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ashraf Mumtaz|title=Ayub, Yahya, Bhutto, Mujib played part|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/politics/16-Dec-2011/Ayub-Yahya-Bhutto-Mujib-played-part|accessdate=24 February 2012|newspaper=The Nation|date=16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; believed in Pakistan and was determined to make Bangladesh".&lt;ref name="The Nation"/&gt; As long as she is the prime minister, relations between Bangladesh and Pakistan cannot normalise, [[The Nation (Pakistani newspaper)|''The Nation'']] noted.&lt;ref name="The Nation"/&gt;

[[File:Zulfikar Ali Bhutto 1971.jpg|thumb|right|Bhutto in 1971.]]
On 26 March 1971 Mujib was arrested by the Pakistan Army, which had been ordered by Yahya to suppress political activities.&lt;ref name="SelectiveGenocide"&gt;Blood, Archer, [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB79/BEBB1.pdf Transcript of Selective Genocide Telex], Department of State, United States&lt;/ref&gt; While supportive of the army's actions and working to rally international support, Bhutto distanced himself from the Yahya regime and began to criticise Khan for mishandling the situation.&lt;ref name="Jang News Group"&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title=Bhutto, Sheikh Mujib, and United States |author=Mir, Hamid |date=18 April 2011 |newsgroup=www.jang.com.pk |message-id= |url=http://www.jang.com.pk/jang/apr2011-daily/18-04-2011/col5.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refused to accept Yahya's scheme to appoint Bengali politician [[Nurul Amin]] as Prime minister, with Bhutto as deputy prime minister.&lt;ref name="Jang News Group"/&gt; Soon after his refusal and continuous resentment toward General Yahya Khan's mishandling of situation, General Yahya Khan ordered Military Police to arrest Bhutto for a treason charges, a quiet similar to Mujib.&lt;ref name="Jang News Group"/&gt; Bhutto was situated at the [[Adiala Jail]] along with Mujib, where he was set to face the charges.&lt;ref name="Jang News Group"/&gt; The [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|Indian intervention]] in East Pakistan led to the very bitter defeat of Pakistani forces, who surrendered on 16 December 1971. Bhutto and others condemned Yahya for failing to protect Pakistan's unity.&lt;ref name="Jang News Group"/&gt; Isolated, Yahya resigned on 20 December and transferred power to Bhutto, who became president, commander-in-chief and the first civilian chief martial law administrator.&lt;ref name="USCS2" /&gt;

Bhutto was the country's first civilian chief martial law administrator since 1958, as well as the country's first civilian president.&lt;ref name="USCS2" /&gt; With Bhutto assuming the control, the leftists and democratic socialists entered the country's politics, and later emerged as power players in the country's politics. And, for the first time in the country's history, the leftists and democratic socialists had a chance to administer the country with the popular vote and widely approved exclusive mandate, given to them by the West's population in the 1970s elections.&lt;ref name="USCS2" /&gt;

In a reference written by [[Kuldip Nayar]] in his book "''Scoop! Inside Stories from the Partition to the Present''", Nayar noted that "Bhutto's releasing of Mujib did not mean anything to Pakistan's policy as in if there was no liberation war.&lt;ref name="HarperCollins (1 October 2006)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nayar|first=Kuldip|title=Scoop! : Inside Stories from Partition to the Present|date=1 October 2006|publisher=HarperCollins (1 October 2006)|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-81-7223-643-4|pages=213 pages|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/forum/2006/december/bhuttonmujib.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutto's policy, and even as of today, the policy of Pakistan continues to state that "she will continue to fight for the honor and integrity of Pakistan. East Pakistan is an inseparable and unseverable part of Pakistan".&lt;ref name="HarperCollins (1 October 2006)"/&gt;

==President of Pakistan==
A [[Pakistan International Airlines]] flight was sent to fetch Bhutto from New York, who at that time was presenting Pakistan's case before the [[United Nations Security Council]] on the East Pakistan Crises. Bhutto returned home on 18 December 1971. On 20 December, he was taken to the President House in Rawalpindi, where he took over two positions from Yahya Khan, one as president and the other as first civilian Chief Martial Law Administrator. Thus, he was the first civilian Chief Martial Law Administrator of the dismembered Pakistan. By the time Bhutto had assumed control of what remained of Pakistan, the nation was completely isolated, angered, and demoralized.

[[File:NixonBhutto1973.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Nixon]] and Bhutto in 1973]]

As president, Bhutto faced mounting challenges on both internal and foreign fronts. The trauma was severe in Pakistan, a psychological setback and emotional breakdown for Pakistan. The [[two-nation theory]]—the theoretical basis for the creation of Pakistan—lay discredited, and Pakistan's foreign policy collapsed when no moral support was found anywhere, including long-standing allies such as the U.S. and China. Since her creation, the physical and moral existence of Pakistan was in great danger. On the internal front, [[Baloch nationalism|Baloch]], [[Sindhi nationalism|Sindhi]] and [[Pashtun nationalism]]s were at their peak, calling for their independence from Pakistan. Finding it difficult to keep Pakistan united, Bhutto launched full-fledged intelligence and military operations to stamp out any separatist movements. By the end of 1978, these nationalist organizations were brutally quelled by Pakistan Armed Forces.&lt;ref name=Atlantic&gt;Langewiesche, William "[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/11/the-wrath-of-khan/4333/3/ The Wrath of Khan]". ''[[The Atlantic]]''. November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhutto immediately placed Yahya Khan under house arrest, brokered a ceasefire and ordered the release of Sheikh Mujib, who was held prisoner by the Pakistan Army. To implement this, Bhutto reversed the verdict of Mujib's earlier court-martial trial, in which [[Brigadier-General]] [[Rahimuddin Khan]] had sentenced Mujib to death. Appointing a new cabinet, Bhutto appointed Lieutenant-General [[Gul Hasan]] as [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]]. On 2 January 1972 Bhutto announced the nationalisation of all major industries, including iron and steel, heavy engineering, heavy electricals, petrochemicals, cement and public utilities.&lt;ref name="USCS"&gt;{{cite news
| author = US Country Studies|url=http://countrystudies.us/pakistan/20.htm| title = Zulfikar Ali Bhutto| format = PHP| accessdate =7 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new labour policy was announced increasing workers' rights and the power of trade unions. Although he came from a feudal background himself, Bhutto announced reforms limiting land ownership and a government take-over of over a million acres to distribute to landless peasants. More than 2,000 civil servants were dismissed on charges of corruption.&lt;ref name="USCS" /&gt; Bhutto also dismissed the military chiefs on 3 March after they refused orders to suppress a major police strike in Punjab. He appointed General [[Tikka Khan]] as the new Chief of the Army Staff in March 1972 as he felt the general would not interfere in political matters and would concentrate on rehabilitating the Pakistan Army. Bhutto convened the National Assembly on 14 April, rescinded martial law on 21 April and charged the legislators with writing a new constitution.

Bhutto visited India to meet Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] and negotiated a formal peace agreement and the release of 93,000 Pakistani [[prisoners of war]]. The two leaders signed the [[Simla Agreement]], which committed both nations to establish a new-yet-temporary [[Line of Control]] in Kashmir and obligated them to resolve disputes peacefully through bilateral talks.&lt;ref name="USCS" /&gt; Bhutto also promised to hold a future summit for the peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute and pledged to recognise Bangladesh. Although he secured the release of Pakistani soldiers held by India, Bhutto was criticised by many in Pakistan for allegedly making too many concessions to India. It is theorised that Bhutto feared his downfall if he could not secure the release of Pakistani soldiers and the return of territory occupied by Indian forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Frank | first = Katherine | authorlink = Katherine Frank | year = 2002 | title = Indira: The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | location = USA | isbn = 978-0-395-73097-3 | pages = 346–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutto established an atomic power development programme and inaugurated the first Pakistani [[atomic reactor]], built in collaboration with Canada in [[Karachi]] on 28 November. On 30 March 59 military officers were arrested by army troops for allegedly plotting a coup against Bhutto, who appointed then-Brigadier [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] to head a military tribunal to investigate and try the suspects. The National Assembly approved the [[Constitution of Pakistan|new 1973 Constitution]], which Bhutto signed into effect on 12 April. The constitution proclaimed an "[[Islamic Republic]]" in Pakistan with a parliamentary form of government.&lt;ref name="Cons"&gt;{{cite news| author = Story of Pakistan|url=http://www.storyofpakistan.com/articletext.asp?artid=A072| title = Ouster of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto| format = PHP| accessdate =7 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 August, Bhutto turned over the post of president to [[Fazal Ilahi Chaudhry]], assuming the office of prime minister instead.&lt;ref name="USCS" /&gt;

Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was the founder of [[Pakistan and its Nuclear Deterrent Program|Pakistan's atomic bomb programme]], and due to his administrative and aggressive leadership to lead this nuclear deterrence programme, Bhutto is often known as Father of Nuclear deterrence programme.&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt;&lt;ref name="International Institute for Strategic Studies through the 2006 dossier.

Surprisingly, the dossier has paid rich tributes to the services of Bhutto for developing the nuclear programme. The dossier, in a chapter on Pakistan's nuclear programme and imports, reveals that Dr AQ Khan can only be accorded many epithets, including "founder of Pakistan uranium enrichment programme".''The First 2006 dossier published by [[International Institute for Strategic Studies|IISS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Rehman | first =Shahid-ur | title =Long Road to Chagai | place =Islamabad, Islamabad Capital Territory | publisher =Printwise Publications | year =1999 | volume =1 | edition =1 | pages =21–23| isbn =978-969-8500-00-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutto's interest in nuclear technology was said to have begun during his college years in the United States when Bhutto attended a course in political science, discussing political impact of U.S.'s first nuclear test, [[Trinity (nuclear test)|''Trinity'']], on Global politics.&lt;ref name="Printwise Publications"/&gt; While at Berkeley, Bhutto witnessed the public panic when the Soviet Union first exploded the bomb, codename [[RDS-1|''First Lightning'']] in 1949, prompting the U.S. government to famously launch the research on [[Teller–Ulam design|Hydrogen bombs]].&lt;ref name="Printwise Publications"/&gt; However, in 1958 when long before as Minister for Fuel, [[Ministry of Water and Power (Pakistan)|Power]], and [[Ministry of Environment (Pakistan)|National Resources]], Bhutto played a key role in setting up the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] (PAEC) administrative research bodies and institutes.&lt;ref name="International Institute for Strategic Studies through the last 2007 dossier"/&gt; Soon, Bhutto offered a technical post to Munir Ahmad Khan in PAEC in 1958, and lobbied for Abdus Salam as being appointed as Science Adviser in 1960.&lt;ref name="International Institute for Strategic Studies through the last 2007 dossier"/&gt; Before being elevated as Foreign minister, Bhutto directed the funds for key research in nuclear weapons and related science.&lt;ref name="International Institute for Strategic Studies through the last 2007 dossier"/&gt;

In October 1965, as [[Foreign Minister of Pakistan|Foreign Minister]], Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto visited Vienna, where nuclear engineer [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] working at a senior technical post at the [[IAEA]], informed him of the status of [[Indian nuclear programme]] and the options Pakistan had to develop its own nuclear capability.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Both agreed on the need for Pakistan to develop a nuclear deterrent to meet India's nuclear capacity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} While, Munir Ahmad Khan had failed to convince Ayub Khan, Bhutto had said to Munir Ahmad Khan: ''Don't worry, our turn will come''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Shortly, after the 1965 war, Bhutto in a press conference, famously declared that "''even if we have to eat grass, we will make nuclear bomb. We have no other choice.''" as he saw India was making its way to develop the bomb.&lt;ref name="Federation of American Scientists (FAS)"/&gt; In 1965, Bhutto lobbied for Salam and succeeded to appoint Salam as the head of Pakistan's delegation at IAEA, and helped Salam to lobby for acquiring of the nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name="International Institute for Strategic Studies through the last 2007 dossier"/&gt; In November 1972, Bhutto advised Salam to travel to United States to evade the war, and advised him to return with the key literature on [[History of nuclear weapons|nuclear history]]. By the end week of December 1972, Salam returned to Pakistan, loaded with literature on the ''[[Manhattan Project]]'', in his huge suitcases. In 1974, Bhutto launched a more aggressive and serious diplomatic offensive on the United States and the Western world over the nuclear issues. Writing to the world and Western leaders, Bhutto made it clear and maintained:

{{quote|text=Pakistan was exposed to a kind of "nuclear threat and blackmail" unparalleled elsewhere.... If the world's community failed to provide political insurance to Pakistan and other countries against the nuclear blackmail, these countries would be constraint to launch atomic bomb programs of their own!...

Shortly, roughly two weeks past after experiencing the [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1971|1971 winter war]], on 20 January 1972, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto rallied a conference of [[Nuclear technology|nuclear]] scientists and [[nuclear engineers|engineers]] at [[Multan]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} While at the Multan meeting, arranged by Bhutto's Science Advisor Abdus Salam, scientists were wondering why the President who had so much on his hands in those trying days was paying so much attention to the scientists and engineers in the nuclear field.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} At the meeting Bhutto slowly talked about the recent war and country's future, pointing out the existence of the country was in great moral danger.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} While the academicians listened to Bhutto carefully, Bhutto said: "Look, we're going to have the [[Atom bomb|bomb]]". Bhutto asked them: "Can you give it to me? And how long will it take it to make a [[Atom bomb|bomb]]?".{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Many of senior scientists had witnessed the war, and were emotionally and psychologically disturbed, therefore, the response was positive when the senior academic scientists replied: "Oh...Yes.. Yes... You can have it."{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} There was a lively debate on the time needed to make the bomb, and finally one scientist dared to say that maybe it could be done in five years.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Prime Minister Bhutto smiled, lifted his hand, and dramatically thrust forward three fingers and said: "Three years, I want it in three years". The atmosphere suddenly became electric.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} It was then that one of the junior scientist Siddique Ahmad Butt (a [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]]), who under [[Munir Ahmad Khan]]'s guiding hand would come to play a major role in making the fission weapon possible – jumped to his feet and clamoured for his leader's attention.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Siddique Ahmad Butt replied: "It can be done in three years". When Bhutto heard Butt's reply, Bhutto was very much amused and said: "Well.... Much as I appreciate your enthusiasm, this is a very serious political decision, which Pakistan must make, and perhaps all [[Third World]] countries must make one day, because it is coming. So can you boys do it?". Nearly all senior scientists replied in one tone: Yes... We can do it, given the resources and given the facilities". Bhutto ended the meeting by simply saying: "I shall find you the resources and I shall find you the facilities".{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Before the 1970s, the nuclear deterrence was long established under the government of [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy|Suhrawardy]], but was completely peaceful and devoted for [[Nuclear power in Pakistan|civil power]]. Bhutto, in his book ''The Myth of Independence'' in 1969 wrote that:

{{quote|text=If Pakistan restricts or suspends her [[Pakistan and its Nuclear Deterrent Program|nuclear deterrence]], it would not only enable India to [[Nuclear blackmail|blackmail]] Pakistan with her [[Indian nuclear programme|nuclear advantage]], but would impose a crippling limitation on the development of Pakistan's [[Science in Pakistan|science and technology]]....

After India's nuclear test – codename [[Pokhran-I|''Smiling Buddha'']]—in May 1974, Bhutto sensed and saw this test as final anticipation for Pakistan's death.&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt; In a press conference, held shortly after India's nuclear test, Bhutto said, "India's nuclear program is designed to intimidate Pakistan and establish "''hegemony in the subcontinent''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=(NTI) |first=Nuclear Threat Initiative |authorlink=NTI |title=The Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), United States |url=http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/Pakistan/Nuclear/chronology_1974.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918040826/http://www.nti.org/e_research/profiles/Pakistan/Nuclear/chronology_1974.html |archivedate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Pakistan limited financial resources, Bhutto was so enthusiastic about Pakistan nuclear energy project, that he is reported to have said "''Pakistanis will eat grass but make a nuclear bomb.''"&lt;ref&gt;Siddiqi, Shahid R.

[[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]]'s militarisation was initiated on 20 January 1972 and, in its initial years, was implemented by Pakistan Army's [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]] General [[General Tikka Khan and East Pakistan|Tikka Khan]]. The [[Karachi Nuclear Power Plant]] (KANUPP-I) was inaugurated by Bhutto during his role as [[President of Pakistan|President]] of Pakistan at the end of 1972&lt;ref name="International Institute for Strategic Studies through the last 2007 dossier"&gt;{{cite web | last1 =(IISS) | first1 =The International Institute for Strategic Studies | authorlink =International Institute for Strategic Studies |first2=Mark|last2=Fitzpatrick | title =Bhutto, not A.

Bhutto's Science Advisor, [[Abdus Salam]]'s office was also sat up in Bhutto's Prime minister Secretariat.&lt;ref name="Printwise Publications"/&gt; On Bhutto's request, Salam had established and led the Theoretical Physics Group (TPG) that marked the beginning of the nuclear deterrent programme. The TPG designed and developed the nuclear weapons as well as the entire programme.&lt;ref name="Printwise Publications"/&gt; Later, [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] had him personally approved the budget for the development of the programme.&lt;ref name="Printwise Publications"/&gt;

Wanting a capable administrator, Bhutto sought [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Rahimuddin Khan]] to chair the commission, which Rahimuddin declined, in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maulana Kausar Niazi|Niazi, Maulana Kausar]] (1991) [http://bhutto.org/Acrobat/Last%20Dayf%20of%20Premier%20Bhutto.pdf ''Last Days of Premier Bhutto'']. p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, in January 1972, Bhutto chose a U.S.-trained [[Nuclear engineering|nuclear engineer]], [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], as chairman of [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] (PAEC) as Bhutto realised that he wanted an administrator who understood the scientific and economical needs of this such technologically giant and ambitious programme. Since 1965, Khan had developed an extremely close and trusted relationship with Bhutto, and even after his death, Benazir and Murtaza Bhutto were instructed by their father to keep in touch with Munir Ahmad Khan. In spring of 1976, [[Kahuta Research Laboratories|Kahuta Research Facility]], then known as [[Engineering Research Laboratories]] (ERL), as part of codename ''[[Project-706]]'', was also established by Bhutto, and brought under nuclear scientist [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]] and the [[Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers]]' [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Zahid Ali Akbar Khan|Zahid Ali Akbar]].&lt;ref name="Printwise Publications"/&gt;

Because Pakistan, under Bhutto, was not a signatory or party of the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] (NPT), the [[Nuclear Suppliers Group]] (NSG), [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique]] (CEA), and [[British Nuclear Fuels]] (BNFL) had immediately cancelled fuel reprocessing plant projects with PAEC. And, according to [[Maulana Kausar Niazi|Causar Nyäzie]], the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission officials had misled Bhutto and he sought on a long journey to try to get nuclear fuel reprocessing plant from France.&lt;ref name="Maulana Kausar Niazi and Sani Panwjar"&gt;[[Maulana Kausar Niazi|Niazi, Maulana Kausar]] (1991) [http://bhutto.org/Acrobat/Last%20Dayf%20of%20Premier%20Bhutto.pdf ''Last Days of Premier Bhutto'']. Chapter 9: The Reprocessing Plant—The Inside Story&lt;/ref&gt; It was on the advice of A. Q. Khan that no fuel existed to reprocess and urged Bhutto to follow his pursuit of uranium enrichment.&lt;ref name="Maulana Kausar Niazi and Sani Panwjar"/&gt; Bhutto tried to show he was still interested in that expensive route and was relieved when Kissinger persuaded the French to cancel the deal.&lt;ref name="Maulana Kausar Niazi and Sani Panwjar"/&gt; Bhutto had trusted Munir Ahmad Khan's plans to develop the programme ingeniously, and the mainstream goal of showing such interest in French reprocessing plant was to give time to PAEC scientists to gain expertise in building its own reprocessing plants. By the time France's CEA cancelled the project, the PAEC had acquired 95% of the detailed plans of the plant and materials.&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt;

Munir Ahmad Khan and [[Ishfaq Ahmad]] believed that since PAEC had acquired most of the detailed plans, work, plans, and materials, the PAEC, based on that 95% work, could build the plutonium reprocessing reactors on its own, Pakistan should stick to its original plan, the plutonium route.&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt; Bhutto did not disagree but saw an advantage in establishing another parallel programme, the uranium enrichment programme under Abdul Qadeer Khan.&lt;ref name=Atlantic/&gt; Both Munir Khan and Ahmed had shown their concern over on Abdul Qadeer Khan's suspected activities but Bhutto backed Khan when Bhutto maintained that: "No less than any other nation did what Abdul Qadeer Khan (is) doing; the Soviets and Chinese; the British and the French; the Indians and the Israelis; stole the nuclear weapons designs previously in the past and no one questioned them but rather tend to be quiet. We are not stealing what they (illegally) stole in the past (as referring the nuclear weapon designs) but we're taking a small machine which is not useful for making the atomic bomb but for a fuel".&lt;ref name="Printwise Publications"/&gt; International pressure was difficult to counter at that time, and Bhutto, with the help of Munir Ahmad Khan and Aziz Ahmed, tackled the intense heated criticism and diplomatic war with the United States at numerous fronts—while the progress on nuclear weapons remained highly classified.&lt;ref name="Printwise Publications"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawn Newspapers"&gt;{{cite news|work=AFP |title=US lobbied to stop Pakistan nuclear drive: documents |url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/07/27/us-lobbied-to-stop-pakistan-nuclear-drive-documents.html |location=Pakistan |date=27 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727073505/http://www.dawn.com/2011/07/27/us-lobbied-to-stop-pakistan-nuclear-drive-documents.html |archivedate=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this pressure, Aziz Ahmed played a significant role by convincing the consortium industries to sell and export sensitive electronic components before the United States could approach to them and try and prevent the consortium industries to export such equipments and components.&lt;ref name="Printwise Publications"/&gt; Bhutto slowly reversed and thwarted United States' any attempt to infiltrate the programme as he had expelled many of the [[Henry A. Byroade|American diplomatic officials]] in the country, under ''Operation Sun Rise'', authorised by Bhutto under [[ISI (Pakistan)|''ISI'']].&lt;ref name="Printwise Publications"/&gt; On the other hand, Bhutto intensified his staunch support and eye-blindly backed Abdul Qadeer Khan to quietly bring the Urenco's weapon-grade technology to Pakistan, keeping the Kahuta Laboratories hidden from the outside world.&lt;ref name="Printwise Publications"/&gt; Regional rivals such as India and Soviet Union, had no basic intelligence on Pakistan's [[Kahuta Project|nuclear energy project]] during the 1970s, and Bhutto's intensified clandestine efforts seemed to be paid off in 1978 when the programme was fully matured.&lt;ref name="Printwise Publications"/&gt;

In a thesis written in ''The Myth of Independence'', Bhutto argued that nuclear weapons would allow India to use its [[Indian Air Force|Air Force]] warplanes that with the use of small [[Battlefield range ballistic missile|battlefield]] [[nuclear device]]s against the Pakistan Army cantonments, armoured and infantry columns and PAF bases and nuclear and military industrial facilities.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"&gt;[[#Bhutto|Bhutto]], pp. 159–359&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian Air Force would not meet with an adverse reaction from the world community as long as civilian casualties could be kept to a minimum.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt; This way, India would defeat Pakistan, force its armed forces into a humiliating surrender and occupy and annexe the [[Northern Areas]] of Pakistan and [[Azad Kashmir]]. India would then carve up Pakistan into tiny states based on ethnic divisions and that would be the end of the "Pakistan problem" once and for all.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press"/&gt;

By the time Bhutto was ousted, this crash programme had fully matured in terms of technical development as well as scientific efforts.&lt;ref name="Printwise Publications"/&gt; By the 1977, PAEC and KRL had built their uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing plants, and selection for test sites, at [[Chagai Hills]], was done by the PAEC.&lt;ref name="Global Security.org" /&gt; The feasibility reports were submitted by both organisations on their works.&lt;ref name="Global Security.org"/&gt; In 1977, the PAEC's Theoretical Physics Group had finished the designing of the first fission weapon, and KRL scientists succeeded in [[electromagnetic isotope separation]] of Uranium fissile isotopes.&lt;ref name="Global Security.org"/&gt; In spite of this, still little had been done in the development of weapons, and Pakistan's nuclear arsenal were actually made by General Zia-ul-Haq's military regime, under the watchful eyes of several Naval admirals, Army and Air Force's generals including [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]].&lt;ref name="Maulana Kausar Niazi and Sani Panwjar"/&gt; In 1983, Bhutto's decision later proved to be right, when PAEC had conducted a cold test, near Kirana Hills, evidently made from non-fissioned plutonium. It has been speculated recently in the press that Dr. Khan's uranium enrichment designs were used by the Chinese in exchange for [[Uranium hexafluoride|(UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)]] and some highly enriched weapons grade uranium.&lt;ref name="Maulana Kausar Niazi and Sani Panwjar"/&gt; Later on this weapons grade uranium was offered back to the Chinese as the Pakistanis used their own materials.&lt;ref name="Maulana Kausar Niazi and Sani Panwjar"/&gt; In all, Bhutto knew that Pakistan had become a nuclear weapon state in 1978 when his friend Munir Ahmad Khan paid a visit to him in his jail cell.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} There, Munir Ahmad Khan told Bhutto that the process of weapon designing is finished and a milestone in the complex and difficult enrichment of weapon-grade fuel has been achieved by the PAEC and dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan of ERL.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Bhutto called for an immediate nuclear test to be conducted, no response was issued by General Zia or any member of his government.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Prime Minister of Pakistan==
Bhutto was sworn in as the prime minister of the country on 14 August 1973, after he had secured 108 votes in a house of 146 members. [[Fazal Ilahi Chaudhry]] was elected as the president under the new constitution.&lt;ref name="Constitution"&gt;[[#Raza|Raza]], pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt; During his five years of government, the Bhutto government made extensive reforms at every level of government.&lt;ref name="bhutto.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutto.org/1976_speech6.php |title=Bhutto |publisher=Bhutto |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan's capital and Western reforms that were begun and built in 1947 throughout the 1970s, were transformed and replaced with Socialist system.&lt;ref name="bhutto.org"/&gt; His policies were seen people friendly, but it did not produce long-lasting effects as the civil disorder against Bhutto began to take place in 1977.&lt;ref name="bhutto.org"/&gt;

===Constitutional reforms===
{{See also|Constitution of Pakistan}}
Bhutto is considered the main architect of 1973 constitution as part of his vision to put Pakistan to road to [[parliamentary democracy]].&lt;ref name="''The Nation'' and M.A. Malik"/&gt; One of the major achievements in Bhutto's life was drafting of Pakistan's first ever consensus constitution to the country.&lt;ref name="''The Nation'' and M.A. Malik"/&gt; Bhutto supervised the promulgation of 1973 constitution that triggered an unstoppable constitutional revolution through his politics wedded to the emancipation of the downtrodden masses, by first giving people a voice in the Parliament, and introducing radical changes in the economic sphere for their benefit .&lt;ref name="''The Nation'' and M.A. Malik"/&gt;

During his period in office the government carried out seven major amendments to the 1973 Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Zulfikar Ali Bhutto: An architect of New Pakistan, From Chaos to Stability and The Constitution'', pp. 5–14&lt;/ref&gt; The First Amendment led to Pakistan's recognition of and diplomatic ties with Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt; The Second Amendment in the constitution declared the [[Ahmadis]] as non-Muslims, and defined the term non-Muslim.&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution (Second Amendment) Act, 1974|url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/amendments/2amendment.html|accessdate=30 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights of the detained were limited under the Third Amendment while the powers and jurisdiction of the courts for providing relief to political opponents were curtailed under the Fourth Amendment.&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt; The Fifth Amendment passed on 15 September 1976, focused on curtailing the power and jurisdiction of the Judiciary.&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt; This amendment was highly criticised by lawyers and political leaders.&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt; The main provision of the Sixth Amendment extended the term of the Chief Justices of the Supreme Court and the High Courts beyond the age of retirement.&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt; This Amendment was made in the Constitution to favour the then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court who was supposed to be a friend of Bhutto.&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt;

===Domestic reforms===
The Bhutto government carried out a number of reforms in the industrial sector. His reforms were twofold: nationalisation, and the improvement of workers' rights.&lt;ref name="The Reforms"&gt;[[#Raza|Raza]], pp. 17–20&lt;/ref&gt; In the first phase, basic industries like steel, chemical and cement were nationalised. This was done in 1972.&lt;ref name="The Reforms"/&gt; The next major step in nationalisation took place on 1 January 1974, when Bhutto nationalised all banks.&lt;ref name="The Reforms"/&gt; The last step in the series was the nationalisation of all flour, rice and cotton mills throughout the country.&lt;ref name="The Reforms"/&gt; This nationalisation process was not as successful as Bhutto expected.&lt;ref name="The Reforms"/&gt; Most of the nationalised units were small businesses that could not be described as industrial units, hence making no sense for the step that was taken.&lt;ref name="The Reforms"/&gt; Consequently, a considerable number of small businessmen and traders were ruined, displaced or rendered unemployed. In the concluding analysis, nationalisation caused colossal loss not only to the national treasury but also to the people of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="The Reforms"/&gt;

The Bhutto government established a large number of rural and urban schools, including around 6,500 elementary schools, 900 middle schools, 407 high schools, 51 intermediate colleges and 21 junior colleges.&lt;ref name="bhutto.org"/&gt; Bhutto also abandoned the Western education system and most of the literature was sent back to Western world; instead his government encouraged the local academicians to publish  books on their respected fields. Though the local books were made cheaper to the public, these reforms came with controversy. His government made [[Islamic studies|Islamic]] and [[Pakistan studies]] compulsory in schools. Book banks were created in most institutions and over 400,000 copies of text-books were supplied to students.&lt;ref name="bhutto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhutto.org/1976_speech6.php |title=Bhutto |publisher=Bhutto |accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhutto is credited for establishing the world class [[Quaid-e-Azam University]] and [[Allama Iqbal Open University]] in Islamabad in 1974, as well as establishing Gomal University Dera Ismail Khan in 1973. In his role as Foreign Minister, and in 1967 with the help of Abdus Salam, established the Institute of Theoretical Physics. As Prime Minister, Bhutto made revolutionary efforts to expand the web of education. Bhutto established the [[Allama Iqbal Medical College]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="Allama Iqbal Medical University"&gt;{{cite web|last=University Press|title=Allama Iqbal Medical University|url=http://ilm.com.pk/reviews/university-reviews/allama-iqbal-medical-college-lahore/|publisher=Allama Iqbal Medical University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, with the help of Abdus Salam, Bhutto gave authorisation of the [[International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics|International Nathiagali Summer College on Contemporary Physics]] (INSC) at the Nathiagali and as even as of today, INSC conference is still held on Pakistan, where thousands of scientists from all over the world are delegated to Pakistan to interact with Pakistan's academic scientists. In 1976, Bhutto established the [[Pakistan Engineering Council|Engineering Council]], [[Pakistan Institute of Physics|Institute of Theoretical Physics]], [[Pakistan Academy of Letters]] and Cadet college Razmak in North Waziristan. A further four new Universities which have been established at Multan, Bahawalpur, and Khairpur. The People's Open University is another innovative venture which has started functioning from Islamabad. The Government's Education Policy provides for the remission of fees and the grant of a number of scholarships for higher education to the children of low-paid employees&lt;ref name="bhutto1"/&gt;

Seven thousand new hostel seats were planned to be added to the existing accommodation after the 1977 election. Bhutto said in 1975 he was aware "of the difficulties and deficiencies faced by college students in many of the existing hostels. Directions have, therefore, been issued that fans, water-coolers and pay-telephones must be provided in each and every hostel in as short a time as physically possible."&lt;ref name="bhutto1"/&gt;

===Land, flood and agriculture reforms===
During his period as prime minister, a number of land reforms were also introduced.&lt;ref name="The Reforms"/&gt; The important land reforms included the reduction of land ceilings and introducing the security of tenancy to tenant farmers.&lt;ref name="The Reforms"/&gt; The land ceiling was fixed to {{convert|150|acre|km2}} of irrigated land and {{convert|300|acre|km2}} of non-irrigated land. Another step that Bhutto took was to democratise Pakistan's Civil Service.&lt;ref name="The Reforms"/&gt; In [[Balochistan]], the pernicious practice of Shishak and Sardari System was abolished. In 1976, the Bhutto government carried out the establishment of Federal Flood Commission (FFC), and was tasked to prepare national flood protection plans, and flood forecasting and research to harness floodwater.&lt;ref name="Dawn News Papers, 2010/08/24"&gt;{{cite news|last=Qureshi, Ali Ahmed |title=Mind-boggling hard-heartedness |url=http://www.dawn.com/2010/08/24/mind-boggling-hard-heartedness.html |newspaper=Dawn News |date=24 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120160524/http://www.dawn.com/2010/08/24/mind-boggling-hard-heartedness.html |archivedate=20 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tribune Express, 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Arshad H Abbasi|title=The Floods in Pakistan – institutional failures|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/39915/floods-in-pakistan--institutional-failures/|accessdate=12 January 2012|newspaper=Tribune Express, 2010|date=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutto later went on to upgrade a number of dams and barrages built in [[Sindh Province]].

Bhutto was a strong advocate of empowering small farmers. He argued that if farmers were weak and demoralised then Pakistan's agricultural strength would be fragile, believing that farmers would not feel psychologically safe unless the country achieved self-sufficiency in food.&lt;ref name="Japanese State Television"/&gt; Therefore, the Bhutto government launched programs to put the country on road to self-sufficiency in rice hulling, sugar-milling and wheat husking industries.&lt;ref name="Japanese State Television"&gt;{{cite web|last=Asa|first=Akiro Mayashot|title=Japanese TV interview with Bhutto|url=http://www.bhutto.org/interview22.php|website=4 March 1973|publisher=Japanese State Television|accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutto's government intensified the control of [[Rice huller|rice hulling]], [[Sugar mills|sugar]] and wheat husking factories, initially believing that public sector involvement would reduce the influence of multi-national corporations creating monopolies.&lt;ref name="Japanese State Television"/&gt; The Government initiated schemes for combating water logging and salinity.&lt;ref name="Japanese State Television"/&gt; Tax exceptions were also introduced for small landowners to encourage the growth of agriculture.&lt;ref name="Japanese State Television"/&gt; His nationalisation of Sindh-based industries heavily benefited the poor, but badly upset the influential feudal lords.

===Economic policy===

{{Main|Nationalization in Pakistan|Socialist economics}}
Bhutto introduced [[socialist economics]] policies while working to prevent any further division of the country. Major heavy mechanical, chemical, and electrical engineering industries were immediately nationalised by Bhutto, and all of the industries came under direct control of government. Industries, such as [[Karachi Electric Supply Corporation|KESC]] were under complete government control with no private influence in KESC decision. Bhutto abandoned Ayub Khan's [[Capitalism|state capitalism]] policies, and introduced socialist policies in a move to reduce the [[The rich get richer and the poor get poorer|rich get richer and poor get poorer ratio]]. Bhutto also established the [[Port Qasim]], [[Pakistan Steel Mills]], the Heavy Mechanical Complex (HMC) and several cement factories.&lt;ref name="The Reforms"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sustainable Development Policy Institute"/&gt; However, the growth rate of economy relative to that of the 1960s when East Pakistan was still part of Pakistan and large generous [[Foreign aid to Pakistan|aid]] from the United States declined, after the [[1973 oil crisis|global oil crises]] in 1973, which also had a negative impact on the economy.&lt;ref name="International Journal for Socialist Renewel"/&gt; Despite the initiatives undertaken by Bhutto's government to boost the country's economy, the economical growth remained at equilibrium level.&lt;ref name="The Reforms"/&gt; But Bhutto's policy largely benefited the poor and working class when the level of absolute poverty was sharply reduced, with the percentage of the population estimated to be living in absolute poverty falling from 46.50% by the end of 1979–80, under the General Zia-ul-Haq's military rule, to 30.78%.&lt;ref name="The Reforms"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Raza|Raza]], pp. 21–28&lt;/ref&gt; The land reform programme provided increased economic support to landless tenants, and development spending was substantially increased, particularly on health and education, in both rural and urban areas, and provided "material support" to rural wage workers, landless peasants, and urban wage workers.&lt;ref name="The Reforms"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Butt, Muhammad Shoaib and Bandara, Jayatilleke S. (2008) [http://www.gbv.de/dms/zbw/568395328.pdf ''Trade liberalization and regional disparity in Pakistan'']. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|0203887182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhutto's nationalisation policies were initiated with an aim to put workers in control of the tools of production and to protect workers and small businesses.&lt;ref name="Irfan Siddiqui and the Jang News Group"/&gt; However, economical historians argued that the nationalisation program initially effected the small industries and had devastating effects on Pakistan's economy shrunk Bhutto's credibility.&lt;ref name="Irfan Siddiqui and the Jang News Group"&gt;{{cite web |last=Siddiqui |first=Irfan |title=The wavey economy |website=Irfan Siddiqui |publisher=Irfan Siddiqui and the Jang News Group |url=http://www.jang.com.pk/jang/sep2011-daily/22-09-2011/col1.htm |language=ur |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922131319/http://www.jang.com.pk/jang/sep2011-daily/22-09-2011/col1.htm |archive-date=22 September 2011 |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative critics believed the nationalisation policies had damaged investor's confidence and [[government corruption]] in nationalised industries grew, although no serious corruption cases were ever proved against Bhutto by the military junta.&lt;ref name="Irfan Siddiqui and the Jang News Group"/&gt; In 1974, Bhutto maintained that foreign companies and industries in Pakistan were except from nationalisation policies and his government would be willing to receive foreign investment to put up factories.&lt;ref name="Peter Grubbve, editor in Chief of Stern"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grubbve|first=Peter|title=Peter Grubbve interviewing Bhutto|url=http://www.bhutto.org/interviews.php|website=[[Stern (Magazine)|Stern]]|year= 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; While commenting on his policies in 1973, Bhutto told the group of investors that belonged to the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) that "activity of public sector or state sector prevents the concentration of economic power in few hands, and protects the small and medium entrepreneurs from the clutches of giant enterprises and vested interests".&lt;ref name="International Journal for Socialist Renewel"/&gt;

Bhutto's shift away from some socialist policies badly upset his democratic socialist alliance and many in the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]], many of his colleagues, most notable [[Malik Meraj Khalid|Malik Mirage]] left Bhutto and departed to Soviet Union after resigning from Law Minister.&lt;ref name="Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (July 2005)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haqqani|first=Hussain|title=Pakistan:Between Mosque and Military; §From Islamic Republic to Islamic State|year=2005|publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (July 2005)|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87003-214-1|pages=395 pages|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nYppZ_dEjdIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Pakistan:Between+Mosque+and+Military#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous disagreement led the government's socialist alliance to collapse and further uniting with secular [[Tehrik-e-Istiqlal|Independence Movement]] led by [[Asghar Khan]].&lt;ref name="Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (July 2005)"/&gt;

As part of his investment policies, Bhutto founded the [[National Development Finance Corporation]] (NDFC). In July 1973, this financial institute began operation with an initial government investment of 100 million [[Pakistani rupee|PRs]]. It aim was finance public sector industrial enterprises but, later on, its charter was modified to provide finance to the private sector as well. The NDFC is currently the largest development finance institution of Pakistan performing diversified activities in the field of industrial financing and investment banking. 42 projects financed by NDFC have contributed Rs. 10,761 million to Pakistan's GDP and generated Rs. 690 million after-tax profits and 40,465 jobs. By the mid-1990s NDFC had a pool of resources amounting to US $878 million The Bhutto government increased the level of investment, private and public, in the economy from less than Rs. 7,000 million in 1971–72 to more than Rs. 17,000 million in 1974–75.

===Banking and Export expansion===
{{Main|Banking in Pakistan}}

Banking reforms were introduced to provide more opportunities to small farmers and business such as forcing banks to ensure 70% of institutional lending should be for small land holders of 12.5 acres or less, which was a revolutionary idea at a time when banks only clients were the privileged classes.&lt;ref name="International Journal for Socialist Renewel"/&gt; The number of bank branches rose by 75% from December 1971 to November 1976, from 3,295 to 5,727.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Development Policy Institute"/&gt; It was one of the most radical move made by Bhutto, and the Bank infrastructure was expanded covering all towns and villages with a population of 5,000 in accordance with targets set after the nationalisation of banks.&lt;ref name="Sustainable Development Policy Institute"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barons|first=Robber|title=Bhutto's Nationalization|url=http://richpaki.tripod.com/bhutto.htm|website=Robber Barons, researcher at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute|publisher=Sustainable Development Policy Institute|quote=The Bhutto government's credit allocation policy made it mandatory on banks to divert credit into areas which otherwise would not have received credit under normal commercial banking. The rationing of credit might look unreasonable in 1997 but it was revolutionary, considering the situation in 1977 when banks were serving only industrial clients of a privileged class... Robber Barons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By end of the Bhutto government concentration of wealth had declined compared to height of the Ayub Khan era when 22 families owned 66% of industrial capital, and also controlled banking and 97% of insurance.&lt;ref name="International Journal for Socialist Renewel"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tariq|first=Farooq|title=Pakistan—Social and economic crisis: background and perspectives: The civilian rule of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto|url=http://links.org.au/node/278|publisher=International Journal for Socialist Renewal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measures taken in the first few months of 1972 set a new framework for the revival of the economy. The diversion of trade from East Pakistan to international markets was completed within a short period. By 1974, exports exceeded one billion dollars, showing a 60% increase over the combined exports of East and West Pakistan before separation, it was achieved and benefited with world was in the midst of the major [[1973 oil crisis]] and in the middle of global recession
the national income of Pakistan increased by 15% and industrial production by as much as 20% in four years.

===Balochistan===

====Military operation====

{{Main|1970s Operation in Balochistan}}
Following the secession of East Pakistan, calls for the independence of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] by [[Baloch nationalist]]s grew immensely. Surveying the political instability, Bhutto's central government sacked two provincial governments within six months, arrested the two chief ministers, two governors and forty-four [[National Assembly of Pakistan|MNAs]] and [[Members of Parliament|MPAs]], obtained an order from the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] banning the [[National Awami Party|National People's Party]] on the recommendation of [[Akbar Bugti]], and charged everyone with high treason to be tried by a specially constituted [[Hyderabad tribunal]] of hand-picked judges.

In January 1973, Bhutto ordered the Pakistan Armed Forces to suppress a rising insurgency in the province of Balochistan. He dismissed the governments in Balochistan and the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]] once more.&lt;ref name="USCS" /&gt; Following the alleged [[Arms discovery in Iraqi Embassy (Pakistan)|discovery of Iraqi arms in Islamabad]] in February 1973, Bhutto dissolved the [[Provincial Assembly of Balochistan]]. The operation, under General [[Tikka Khan]], soon took shape in a five-year conflict with the [[Balochistan Liberation Army|Baloch separatists]]. The sporadic fighting between the [[insurgency]] and the army started in 1973 with the largest confrontation taking place in September 1974. Later on, Pakistan Navy, under Vice-Admiral Patrick Julius Simpson, also jumped in the conflict as it had applied naval blockades to Balochistan's port. The Navy began its separate operations to seized the shipments sent to aid Baloch separatists. Pakistan Air Force also launched air operations, and with the support of navy and army, the air force had pounded the mountainous hidden heavens of the Separatists. The [[Iranian military]], also fearing a spread of the greater Baloch resistance in Iran, aided the Pakistani military as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4182151.stm| title=Pakistan risks new battlefront| accessdate=8 April 2006| date=17 January 2005 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Iran's contribution were 30 [[Huey cobra]] attack helicopters and $200 million in aid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120622233047/http://www.balochwarna.com/modules/mastop_publish/?tac=Baluchistan%2C_2006 Waiting for the Worst: Baluchistan, 2006]. balochwarna.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iraqi intervention====
{{Main|Arms discovery in Iraqi Embassy (Pakistan)|Iraqi support of Baloch rebels}}
[[Iraq under Saddam Hussein|Iraq]] under Sunni President [[Saddam Hussein]] sent Iraqi made weapons to Pakistan's warm water ports.&lt;ref name="Summary Publishing ltd."&gt;{{cite book|last=Laurie Mylroie|title=Study of Revenge: The First World Trade Center Attack and Saddam Hussein's War Against America|year=2005|publisher=Summary Publishing ltd.|location=United States|isbn=978-0-8447-4169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan's navy mounted an effective blockade.&lt;ref name="Selig Harrison"&gt;{{cite book|last=Selig Harrison|title=In Afghanistan's Shadow: Baluch Nationalism and Soviet Temptation|publisher=Selig Harrison|isbn=978-1-4128-0469-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saddam's government provided support for Baluchi separatists in Pakistan, hoping their conflict would spread to rival Iran.&lt;ref name="Summary Publishing ltd."/&gt; In 1973, Iraq provided the Baluchis with conventional arms, and it opened an office for the Baluchistan Liberation Front (BLF) in Baghdad. This operation was supposed to be covert, but in 1973, the operation was exposed by [[Military Intelligence of Pakistan|M.I.]] when senior separatist leader [[Akbar Bugti]] defected to Bhutto, revealing a series of arms stored in the Iraqi Embassy.&lt;ref name="Summary Publishing ltd."/&gt; On the midnight of 9 February 1973, Bhutto launched an operation to seize control of the Iraqi Embassy, and preparation for siege was hastily prepared. The operation was highly risky and a wrong step could have started a war between the two countries. The operation was carefully analysed and at 0:00hrs (12:00&amp;nbsp;am), the [[Special Service Group|SSG Division]] accompanied by [[Pakistan Army Rangers|Army Rangers]] stormed the Embassy. [[Pakistan Army Corps of Military Police|Military Police]] arrested the Iraqi Ambassador, the military attaché, and Iraq's diplomatic staff.&lt;ref name="Summary Publishing ltd."/&gt; Following the incident, authorities discovered 300 Soviet sub-machine guns with 50,000 rounds of ammunition and a large amount of money that was to be distributed amongst Baluchi separatist groups.&lt;ref name="Summary Publishing ltd."/&gt; Bhutto was angered and frustrated. Without demanding an explanation, he ordered the Military Police to immediately expel the Iraqi Ambassador and his staff as [[persona non grata]] on the first available flight.&lt;ref name="Summary Publishing ltd."/&gt;

The government announced the Iraqi plan to further dismember the country, and Bhutto's successful diplomatic offensive against Iraq isolated Saddam internationally with global condemnation.&lt;ref name="Summary Publishing ltd."/&gt; This incident caused Pakistan to support Iran during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] in the 1980s and the [[U.S. invasion of Iraq]] against Saddam Hussein in 2003.&lt;ref name="Summary Publishing ltd."/&gt;

====Aftermath====

In order to avoid a replay of the East-Pakistan war, Bhutto launched economic and political reforms in the midst of the conflict. Bhutto government abolished the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], the feudal lords continued to appropriate to themselves a generous share of government developmental funds whilst at the same time, they opposed and blackmailed the government whenever they could.&lt;ref name="Global Security.org"/&gt; Gradually the tribesmen started coming out of the Sardars' quarantine.&lt;ref name="Global Security.org"/&gt; Modern amenities, for instance medical aid, automobiles for passenger transport and schooling of children became available in the interior of Baluchistan for the first time, since 1947.&lt;ref name="Global Security.org"/&gt; The Bhutto government also constructed 564 miles of new roads, including the key link between Sibi and Maiwand creating new trade and commerce centres.&lt;ref name="Global Security.org"/&gt;

===Passport reforms===
Bhutto government gave the right of a [[Pakistani passport|passport]] to every citizen of Pakistan and facilitated millions of skilled and non-skilled Pakistanis to seek employment in the Middle Eastern countries through a signing a number combination of bilateral agreements.&lt;ref name="''The Nation'' and M.A. Malik"&gt;{{cite web |last=Malik |first=M.A. |title=PPP sticks to revolutionary culture |website=The Nation |date=2 October 2011 |url=http://nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Opinions/Columns/02-Oct-2011/PPP-sticks-to-revolutionary-culture |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016221148/http://nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Opinions/Columns/02-Oct-2011/PPP-sticks-to-revolutionary-culture |archivedate=16 October 2011 |accessdate=16 October 2011 |quote="Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, besides lifting Pakistan from the ashes after the Dhaka debacle and giving the first ever consensus constitution to the country, revolution through his politics wedded to the emancipation of the downtrodden masses by giving them a voice and introducing radical changes in the economic sphere for their benefit"....

===Labour policy and social security===

The labour policy was among one of the most important cornerstone of Bhutto's government and a comprehensive labour reforms initiated by the Bhutto government.&lt;ref name="bhutto.org"/&gt; Shortly after assuming control, Bhutto's government imposed some conditions on the dismissal of workers. In 1973, the government instituted Labour Courts for the speedy redress of workers' grievances and the government also introduced a scheme for workers' participation in management, through the nationalisation policy.&lt;ref name="bhutto.org"/&gt; This scheme provided for 20% participation by workers in management committees set up at factory level. The Government abolished the workers' contribution to the Social Security Fund; instead, the employers were made to increase their contribution from 4 to 6%. The government enhanced compensation rates under the Worker's Compensation Act.&lt;ref name="bhutto.org"/&gt;

In 1972 the Bhutto government initially provided for some old age benefits for workers through group insurance, increased rates of compensation and higher rates of gratuity.&lt;ref name="bhutto.org"/&gt; However, the policy did not benefited immediately, therefore, the government introduced a pension scheme of old age benefits which would provide a payment of Rs.75 a month to workers after retirement at the age of 55 for men and 50 for women, on condition that the worker had completed a minimum of 15 years insurable employment.&lt;ref name="bhutto.org"/&gt; This applied to all factories, industries, and establishments employing ten or more workers drawing monthly wages up to Rs. 1,000.&lt;ref name="bhutto.org"/&gt; Skilled workers who become invalid after five years of insurable employment were also made entitled to benefits under this scheme.&lt;ref name="bhutto.org"/&gt;

Bhutto did not want to go for the western model where workers generally contribute along with the employers towards their old age benefits.&lt;ref name="bhutto.org"/&gt; In view of Pakistan's conditions, Bhutto's government did not wish the financial burden of this scheme to fall even partly on the worker.&lt;ref name="bhutto.org"/&gt; It was decided that the scheme be founded through a contribution from employers to the extent of 5% of the wage bill.&lt;ref name="bhutto.org"/&gt;

===Foreign policy===
{{Main|Foreign policy of Pakistan}}
After assuming power, Bhutto sought to diversify Pakistan's relations away from the United States and, soon Pakistan left [[CENTO]] and [[SEATO]]. Bhutto developed close and strengthened the [[Arab–Pakistan relations|Arab relations]], and [[China–Pakistan relations|Sino-Pak relations]].&lt;ref name="Times of Bombay"&gt;{{cite news |title=India's twin obsessions: China and Pakistan |url=http://www.timesofbombay.com/?tag=zulfikar-ali-bhutto |newspaper=Times of Bombay |date=15 October 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutto in believed an independent Foreign Policy which had hitherto been the hand maiden of the Western Power, particularly independent from the United States' [[sphere of influence]].&lt;ref name="PPPUSA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Zulfikar Ali Bhutto: The Legacy of Zuli Bhutto |website=PPPUSA |url=http://www.pppusa.org/zabhutto.htm |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Bhutto as Foreign minister, and Prime minister, Pakistan and Iran had cemented a [[Special relationship (international relations)|special relationship]], as Iran had provided military assistance to Pakistan.&lt;ref name="PPPUSA"/&gt; The Sino-Pak relations were immensely improved, and Pakistan, under Bhutto, had built a strategic relationship with People's Republic of China, when PRC was isolated.&lt;ref name="Times of Bombay"/&gt; In 1974, Bhutto hosted the second [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC) in 1974 where he delegated and invited leaders from the [[Muslim world]] to [[Lahore]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab Province]] of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Sharmila Faruqui" /&gt; Bhutto was a strong advocate of Afro-Asian Solidarity and had cemented ties with Afro-Asian and Islamic countries and by 1976 had emerged as the Leader of the Third World .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ariftx.tripod.com/z_a_bhutto.html |title=Z.A.

[[File:Meeting with the President of Pakistan in the Oval Office - NARA - 194749.tif|thumb|250px|left|Bhutto with [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] in the Oval Office, 1971.]]
Bhutto sought a peace agreement—[[Simla Agreement]]—with [[Indira Gandhi]], Premier of India, and brought back 93,000 [[Prisoners of War|P.O.Ws]] to Pakistan and secured {{convert|5000|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} held by India with out compromising on Kashmir stance or recognising Bangladesh which were the key Indian demands.&lt;ref name="Sharmila Faruqui"/&gt; Negotiating with a power that has dismembered the country was an open-challenge to Bhutto who smoothly convinced India to return the territory and the POWs back to Pakistan.&lt;ref name="M.P Ajithkumar"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ajithkumar|first=M P|title=Secret of Shimla Agreement|url=http://www.peacekashmir.org/views-articles/2011/0607-secret-of-shimla-agreement.htm|website=M P Ajithkumar (Lecturer in History, Sanathana Dharma College, Alappuzha)|publisher=M.P Ajithkumar|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this conference, Bhutto and his colleagues did the comprehensive homework as Bhutto had realised that [[Arab League|Arabs]] had still not succeeded in regaining [[Golan Heights|territory lost]] in the [[Six-Day War|1967 war]] with Israel.&lt;ref name="M.P Ajithkumar"/&gt; Therefore, capturing of land does not cry out for [[United Nations|international attention]] the same way as the prisoners do.&lt;ref name="M.P Ajithkumar"/&gt; According to Benazir Bhutto, Bhutto demanded the control of the territory in the first stage of the Agreement which surprised and shocked the Indian delegation.&lt;ref name="M.P Ajithkumar"/&gt; In Bhutto's point of view, the POW problem was more of a [[Humanitarian crisis|humanitarian problem]] that could be tackled at any time, but the [[Territorial claim|territorial problem]] was something that could be integrated in India as time elapses.&lt;ref name="M.P Ajithkumar"/&gt; Indian Premier Gandhi was stunned and astonished at Bhutto's demand and reacted immediately by refusing Bhutto's demand.&lt;ref name="M.P Ajithkumar"/&gt; However, Bhutto calmed her and negotiated with economic packages dealt with Gandhi.&lt;ref name="M.P Ajithkumar"/&gt; Bhutto's knowledge and his intellectualism impressed Gandhi personally that Gandhi agreed to give the territory back to Bhutto in a first stage of the agreement. Signing of this agreement with Pakistan paying small price is still considered Bhutto's one of the huge diplomatic success.&lt;ref name="M.P Ajithkumar"/&gt;

His vast knowledge, intelligence, and keen awareness of [[post-World War II]], and the [[Manhattan Project|nuclear history]], enabled him to craft the foreign policy which brought unmatched undivideds in Pakistan's foreign policy history.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News Archives"/&gt; Elements of his policy were continued by the successive governments to play a vital role in world's politics.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News Archives"/&gt; In 1974, Bhutto and his Foreign minister Aziz Ahmed brought a [[U.N. resolution]], recommending and calling for the establishment of nuclear-weapon free zone in South Asia, whilst he and Aziz Ahmed aggressively attacked the Indian nuclear programme.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News Archives"/&gt; While Abdul Qadeer Khan was tasked with bringing the gas-centrifuge technology through the means of [[atomic proliferation]], the goal of the resolution was achieved when Bhutto put India on the [[Defensive fighting position|defensive]] position and promoted Pakistan as a [[Nuclear Proliferation Treaty|non-proliferationist]].&lt;ref name="The Dawn News Archives"/&gt;

====East Asia====

Since the 1960s, Bhutto had been an anti-SEATO and preferred a non-aligned policy.&lt;ref name="Routledge Publications"&gt;{{cite book|last=Malik|first=Ahmad Rashid|title=Pakistan-Japan Relations: Continuity §Convergence and Divergence (1971–1977)|year=2009|publisher=Routledge Publications|location=United States, Canada, and Pakistan|isbn=978-0-203-89149-0|pages=145–190|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-jGTWbHC8gwC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=zulfikar+ali+bhutto+and+north+korea#v=onepage&amp;q=zulfikar%20ali%20bhutto%20and%20north%20korea&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after assuming the office, Bhutto took a lengthy foreign trip to [[South East Asia]], seeking closer and tighter relations with [[Vietnam]], Thailand, [[Laos]], Burma, and [[North Korea]].&lt;ref name="Routledge Publications"/&gt; His policy largely followed a tight and closer relations with China, normalised relationships with Soviet Union, built an Islamic bloc, and advocated a creation of new economical alliance largely benefiting the third and second world countries.&lt;ref name="Routledge Publications"/&gt;

All of these initiations and implications had disastrous effects on Japan, prompting Japan to oppose Bhutto, although Bhutto was a great admirer of Japan even though Japan was not a constituent part of Bhutto's foreign policy.&lt;ref name="Routledge Publications"/&gt; In the 1970s, Japan made several attempts to get close to Bhutto, sending its military officials, scientists, and parliamentary delegations to Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Routledge Publications"/&gt; Hence Japan went far by condemning India for carrying out a nuclear test, ''Smiling Buddha'', in 1974, and publicly supported Pakistan's non-nuclear weapon policy and pledged to build several new [[nuclear power plants]].&lt;ref name="Routledge Publications"/&gt; In 1970, Bhutto advised Japan not to be party of NPT, but Japan signed it but later regretted for not being properly progressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malik|first=Ahmad Rashid|title=Pakistan-Japan Relations: Continuity §Japanese reaction to Indian bomb|year=2009|publisher=Routledge Publications|location=United States, Canada, and Pakistan|isbn=978-0-203-89149-0|pages=145–190|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bhutto's view, Japan had been under the United States' influence, and much bigger role of Japan in Asia would only benefit American interests in the region.&lt;ref name="Routledge Publications"/&gt; By the 1970s, Japan completely lost its momentum in Pakistan as Pakistan followed a strict independent policy.&lt;ref name="Routledge Publications"/&gt; Bhutto envisioned Pakistan's new policy as benefiting the economic relations rather than the military alliance which also affected Japan's impact on Pakistan.&lt;ref name="Routledge Publications"/&gt; However, much of the foreign policy efforts were reverted by General Zia-ul-Haq and ties were finally restored after Bhutto's execution.&lt;ref name="Routledge Publications"/&gt;

====Arab world and Israel====
Bhutto sought to improve Pakistan's ties with the Arab world, and sided with the Arab world during the Arab-Israeli conflict.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News Archives"&gt;{{cite news|last=Khan|first=Iqbal Ahmad|title=Bhutto's foreign policy legacy|url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/31374|accessdate=27 October 2011|newspaper=The Dawn News Archives|date=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colonel Gaddafi]] of former [[Libya under Gaddafi|Socialist Libya]] considered Bhutto as one of his greatest inspirations and was said to be very fond of Bhutto's intellectualism.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News Archives"/&gt; In 1973, during the [[Yom Kippur War]], Pakistan's relations with the Arab world represented a watershed.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News Archives"/&gt; In both Pakistan and the Arab world, Pakistan's swift, unconditional and forthright offer of assistance to the Arab states was deeply appreciated.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News Archives"/&gt;
In 1974, pressured by other Muslim nations, Pakistan eventually recognised Bangladesh as [[Mujib]] stated he would only go to the OIC conference in Lahore if Pakistan recognised Bangladesh.&lt;ref name="The Dawn News Archives"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hagerty, Devin T. (2005) ''South Asia in world politics'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield. {{ISBN|0742525872}}. p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan established full diplomatic relations with Bangladesh on 18 January 1976 and relations improved in the following decades.&lt;ref name="PPPUSA"/&gt; Bhutto aided the [[Syrian Air Force|Syrian]] and [[Egyptian Air Force]] by sending the [[Pakistan Air Force]] and [[Pakistan Navy|Navy]]'s top fighter pilots where they flew combat missions against Israel. However, Iraq was not benefited with Bhutto policies.

In early 1977, Bhutto decided to use [[ISI (Pakistan)|''ISI'']] to provide the credible intelligence on [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraqi nuclear program]] that Pakistan and the ''ISI'' had secretly gained.&lt;ref name="Summary Publishing ltd."/&gt; The government passed intel that identified Iraqi nuclear program and the [[Osirak Nuclear Reactor]] at [[Osirak]] to Israel's ''[[Mossad]]''.&lt;ref name="Summary Publishing ltd."/&gt; Helping Israel to infiltrate Iraqi nuclear program was also continued by General Zia-ul-Haq as their policy to teach Iraq and Saddam Hussein a lesson for supporting the Baloch liberation fronts and movements.&lt;ref name="Summary Publishing ltd."/&gt;

====United States and Soviet Union====
{{Main|Pakistan–United States relations|Pakistan–Soviet Union relations}}
In 1974, India carried out a nuclear test, codenamed ''[[Smiling Buddha]]'', near Pakistan's eastern border. Bhutto unsuccessfully lobbied for the United States to impose economic sanctions on India.&lt;ref name="historycommons.com" /&gt; However, at the request of Bhutto, Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States convened a meeting with Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]]. Kissinger told Pakistan's ambassador to Washington that the test is "''a fait accompli and that Pakistan would have to learn to live with it''," although he was aware this was a "little rough" on the Pakistanis.&lt;ref name="historycommons.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Zulfikar Ali Bhutto |publisher=historycommons.com |url=http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=zulfikar_ali_bhutto_1 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the ties were further severed with Bhutto as Bhutto had continued to administer the research on weapons, and in 1976, in a meeting with Bhutto and Kissinger, Kissinger had told to Bhutto, "that if you [Bhutto] do not cancel, modify or postpone the Reprocessing Plant Agreement, we will make a horrible example from you".&lt;ref name="Zee News" /&gt; The meeting was ended by Bhutto as he had replied: For my country's sake, for the sake of people of Pakistan, I did not succumb to that black-mailing and threats.&lt;ref name="Zee News"&gt;{{cite news |title=Zulfikar Bhutto had blamed US for his 'horrible' fate |url=http://www.zeenews.com/news698531.html |publisher=Zee News |date=8 April 2011 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this meeting, Bhutto intensified Pakistan's foreign policy towards more onto [[Movement of Non-Aligned Countries]], and sought to developed relations with both Soviet Union and the United States. Bhutto was keenly aware of [[Foreign relations of the UK|Great Britain's policy]] of "[[divide and rule]]", and [[Foreign policy of the United States|American policy]] of "unite and rule".&lt;ref name="Times of Bombay" /&gt; In 1974, Bhutto, as Prime minister, visited Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Rashid Ahmad Malk of The News International"&gt;{{cite web |last=Malik |first=Rashid Ahmad |title=Warming Ties With Russia |website=The Foreign Intelligence of News Intertional |publisher=Rashid Ahmad Malk of The News International |date=15 October 2010 |url=http://orientalreview.org/2011/05/25/warming-ties-with-russia/ |accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister Bhutto deliberately undertook to improve relations with the Soviet Union and the Communist bloc.&lt;ref name="Rashid Ahmad Malk of The News International" /&gt; Bhutto sought to developed and alleviated the [[Pakistan–Russia relations|Soviet–Pakistani relations]], with Soviet Union established [[Pakistan Steel Mills]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Steel Mills"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pakistan Steel: Our History |website=Pakistan Steel Mills |url=http://www.paksteel.com.pk/organ_our_history.html |accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify |date=December 2016 |reason=Incoherent, and does not paraphrase source}} The foundation stone for this gigantic project was laid on 30 December 1973 by Bhutto. Facing inexperience for the erection work of the integrated steel mill, Bhutto requested Soviet Union to send its experts.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Steel Mills" /&gt; Soviet Union sends dozens of advisors and experts, under Russian scientist Mikhail Koltokof, who supervised the construction of this integrated Steel Mills, with a number of industrial and consortium companies financing this mega-project.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Steel Mills" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2016}}

The [[Pakistan–United States relations|relationship with United States]] was at low point and severed as United States was opposing Pakistan's nuclear detterrence programme.&lt;ref name="Times of Bombay" /&gt; Although, [[Richard Nixon]] enjoyed firmly strong relations with Bhutto and was a close friend of Bhutto, the graph of relation significantly went down under the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Presidency]] of [[Jimmy Carter]].&lt;ref name="Abdul Ghafoor Bugari and Sani Penhwar, Member of Parliament"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bhurgari|first=Abdul Ghafoor|title=The Falcon of Pakistan|url=https://www.scribd.com/panhwar/d/8087285-Zulfikar-Ali-Bhutto-The-Falcon-of-Pakistan|website=Abdul Ghafoor Bugari|publisher=Abdul Ghafoor Bugari and Sani Penhwar, Member of Parliament|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter tightened the embargo placed on Pakistan and placed a pressure through the [[United States Ambassador to Pakistan]], [[Brigadier-General]] [[Henry A. Byroade|Henry Byroade]].&lt;ref name="Abdul Ghafoor Bugari and Sani Penhwar, Member of Parliament" /&gt; The socialist orientation, and Bhutto's proposed left-wing theories, had badly upset the United States, further ringing bells of alarm in the United States as fearing Pakistan's loss as an ally in the Cold war.&lt;ref name="Abdul Ghafoor Bugari and Sani Penhwar, Member of Parliament" /&gt; The leftists and Bhutto's policy towards Soviet Union was seen sympathetic and had built a bridge for Soviet Union to have gain access in Pakistan's warm water ports, that something both United States and Soviet Union had lacked.&lt;ref name="Abdul Ghafoor Bugari and Sani Penhwar, Member of Parliament" /&gt; During the course of [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 presidential election]], Carter was elected as U.S. President, and his very inaugural speech Carter announced the determination to seek the ban of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name="Abdul Ghafoor Bugari and Sani Penhwar, Member of Parliament" /&gt; With Carter's election, Bhutto lost all links to [[U.S. government|United States administration]] he had through President Nixon.&lt;ref name="Abdul Ghafoor Bugari and Sani Penhwar, Member of Parliament" /&gt; Bhutto had to face the embargo and pressure from the American President who was totally against the political objectives which Bhutto had set forth for his upcoming future plans. Carter indirectly announced his opposition to Bhutto, his ambition and the elections.&lt;ref name="Abdul Ghafoor Bugari and Sani Penhwar, Member of Parliament" /&gt;

Although, Carter placed an embargo on Pakistan, Bhutto under the technical guidance and diplomatic though Aziz Ahmed, succeeded to buy sensitive equipments, common metal materials, and electronic components, marked as "common items", hide the true nature of the intentions, greatly enhance the [[Pakistan and Nuclear Weapons|atomic bomb project]], though a complete failure for Carter's embargo.&lt;ref name="Abdul Ghafoor Bugari and Sani Penhwar, Member of Parliament" /&gt; In a thesis written by historian Abdul Ghafoor Buhgari, Carter keenly sabotaged Bhutto credibility, but did not wanted favoured his execution as Carter made a call to General Zia-ul-Haq to stop the act.&lt;ref name="Abdul Ghafoor Bugari and Sani Penhwar, Member of Parliament" /&gt; Therefore, senior leadership of Pakistan Peoples Party reached out to different country's ambassadors and high commissioners but did not meet with the U.S. ambassador, as the leadership knew the "noble" part played by Carter and his administration.&lt;ref name="Abdul Ghafoor Bugari and Sani Penhwar, Member of Parliament" /&gt; When Carter administration discovered Bhutto's act, the programme was reached to a well advanced level, and furthermore, had disastrous effect on [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT I Treaty]] which was soon collapse, a failure of President Carter to stop the [[atomic proliferation]] and arm race between Soviet Union and United States heightened.&lt;ref name="Abdul Ghafoor Bugari and Sani Penhwar, Member of Parliament" /&gt;

====Afghanistan and Central Asia====
[[File:Zulfiqar with Afghan King Zahir Shah.png|thumb|right|Zulfiqar with Afghan King [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]]]]
In 1972, Bhutto initially tried to build friendly ties with Afghanistan but such attempts where rebuffed in 1973.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt; In 1974, Afghanistan began covert involvement in Pakistan's [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] which became increasingly disturbing for Bhutto's government.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Defence Journal"/&gt; Afghan President [[Mohammed Daoud Khan|Dawood Khan]]'s controversial [[Pashtunistan|Pashtunisation]] policies resulted in Pakistan with gruesome violence and civil disturbances.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Defence Journal"&gt;{{cite web |last=Amin |first=Abdul Hameed |title=Remembering our Warriors: Major-General Baber and Bhutto's Operation Cyclone |website=Pakistan Military Consortium and Directorate for the Military History Research (DMHR) |publisher=Pakistan Defence Journal |year=2001 |url=http://www.defencejournal.com/2001/apr/babar.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428172353/http://www.defencejournal.com/2001/apr/babar.htm |archivedate=28 April 2016 |accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ISI'' quickly pointed out that President Daud was providing safe havens and training camps to anti-Pakistan militants and its intelligence agency had been a main arm of supporting the actions inside Pakistan, including [[Balochistan conflict#Afghanistan|providing support to Baloch separatists]].&lt;ref name="globalsecurity.org"&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/pashtunistan-1973.htm Pashtunistan], GlobalSecurity&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Bhutto's government decided to retaliate, and Bhutto launched a covert counter-operation in 1974 under the command of [[Major-General]] [[Naseerullah Babar]], who was then Director-General of the [[Military Intelligence of Pakistan|M.I.]] Directorate-General for Western Fronts (DGWI).&lt;ref name="Pakistan Defence Journal"/&gt; According to General Baber, it was an excellent idea and it had hard-hitting impact on Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Defence Journal"/&gt; The aim of this operation was to arm the Islamic fundamentalists and to instigate an attack in different parts of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Defence Journal"/&gt; In 1974, Bhutto authorised a covert operation in [[Kabul]] and the [[Pakistan Air Force]] and the members of [[Air Intelligence of Pakistan|AI]] and the [[ISI (Pakistan)|''ISI'']] successfully extradited [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]], [[Jan Mohammad Khan]], [[Gulbadin Hekmatyar]], and [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] to [[Peshawar]], amid fear that Rabbani may be assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Mir | first =Hamid | authorlink =Hamid Mir | title =Master Rabbani's Mistake |language=Urdu| publisher =jang.com.pk| date =22 September 2011 |url=http://www.jang.com.pk/jang/sep2011-daily/22-09-2011/col6.htm | accessdate =22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1974, Bhutto gave final authorisation of covert operation to train Afghan mujaheddin to take on Daoud Khan's government. This operation was an ultimate success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paklinks.com/gs/pakistan-affairs/162348-afghanistan-and-pakistan-relations-the-timeline.html |title=Time line of Pakistan Afghanistan relations |publisher=Paklinks.com |date=2 October 2004 |accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1976 Daud had become concerned about his country's over dependence on the Soviet Union and the rising insurgency, thereon on 7 June 1976, Bhutto paid a three-day state visit to Afghanistan, followed by five-day visit of Daud Khan to Pakistan on August's last week of 1976. On 2 March 1977, an agreement on the resumption of air communications between Afghanistan and Pakistan was reached, as relations continue to improve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paklinks.com/gs/pakistan-affairs/162348-afghanistan-and-pakistan-relations-the-timeline.html |title=Afghanistan &amp; Pakistan Relations.

===Popular unrest===
{{main|Hyderabad tribunal}}
{{Further|Federal Security Force}}

Bhutto began facing considerable criticism and increasing unpopularity as his term progressed. Initially targeting the opposition leader [[Abdul Wali Khan]] and his [[National Awami Party]] (NAP), a democratic socialist party, the socialist and communist mass who gathered under Bhutto's leadership began to disintegrate, thus dividing and allying with secular fronts. Despite the ideological similarity of the two parties, clashes between them became increasingly fierce. This started with the federal government's ousting of the NAP provincial government in Balochistan for alleged secessionist activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ahmed |first=Eqbal |date=October 1977 |title=Militarism and the State Pakistan: Military Intervention |url=http://www.bitsonline.net/eqbal/articles_by_eqbal_view.asp?id=12&amp;cid=3 |work=[[Le Monde diplomatique]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930011814/http://www.bitsonline.net/eqbal/articles_by_eqbal_view.asp?id=12&amp;cid=3 |archive-date=30 September 2007 |via=Articles by Eqbal Ahmed}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ended with the ban on the NAP. Subsequently, much of the NAP top leadership was arrested, after Bhutto's confidant [[Hayat Khan Sherpao|Hyatt Scherpaoi]] was killed in a Peshawar bomb blast. Another notable figure, Chief Justice [[Hamoodur Rahman]] died due to a cardiac arrest while in the office. Between the 1974 and 1976, many of Bhutto's original members had left Bhutto due to political differences or natural death causes. In 1974, Bhutto's trusted Science Advisor [[Abdus Salam]] also left Pakistan when Parliament declared Ahmadiyyah Muslims as non-Muslims. With Salam's departure, the research on nuclear weapons slowed down the progress as Dr. [[Mubashir Hassan]], now Bhutto's appointed Science Advisor, would focus on politics more than the science research. Many civil bureaucrats and military officers loyal to Bhutto were replaced by new faces. Bhutto found himself with new advisers and collaborators.&lt;ref name="Ouster"&gt;{{cite news| author = Story of Pakistan|url=http://www.storyofpakistan.com/articletext.asp?artid=A143| title = Ouster of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto| format = PHP| accessdate =7 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissidence also increased within the PPP and the murder of dissident leader [[Ahmed Raza Kasuri|Ahmad Raza Casuri]]'s father led to public outrage and intra-party hostility as Bhutto was accused of masterminding the crime. Powerful PPP leaders such as Ghulam Mustafa Khar, former Governor of Punjab, openly condemned Bhutto and called for protests against his regime.&lt;ref name="Ouster"/&gt; The political crisis in the North-West Frontier Province and Balochistan intensified as civil liberties remained suspended and an estimated 100,000 troops deployed there were accused of human rights abuses and killing large numbers of civilians.&lt;ref name="USCS" /&gt;

On 8 January 1977, the opposition organized into the [[Pakistan National Alliance]] (PNA).,&lt;ref name="USCS" /&gt; a nine-party coalition against the government of Bhutto and his allies. Bhutto called fresh elections, but the PNA did not obtain a clear majority. The PNA faced defeat but did not accept the results, accusing their opponents of rigging the election. The dissidents ultimately claimed that 40 seats in the national assembly were rigged, and boycotted the provincial elections. In the face of the resulting low voter turnout, the PNA declared the newly elected Bhutto government as illegitimate. Hard-line Islamist leaders such as [[Maulana Maududi]] called for the overthrow of Bhutto's regime.&lt;ref name="Ouster" /&gt; [[Mubashir Hassan]], Science Advisor of Bhutto, feared a possible coup against Bhutto.&lt;ref&gt;Hassan, Mubashir (2000).

"The Final Days of Socialism in Pakistan", pp. 296 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Hassan entered the dispute and made an unsuccessful attempt to reach an agreement with PNA. Most Islamists refused to meet with Hassan as they saw him as the architect of Bhutto's success. The same year, an intensive crackdown was initiated on the [[Pakistan Muslim League]], a conservative front.&lt;ref name="People's Party and Lahore."&gt;{{cite web| title =People's Party and Lahore|url=http://jang.com.pk/jang/jul2011-daily/30-07-2011/col2.htm| year =2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Awami National Party|People's National Party]]'s President and former [[Leader of the Opposition (Pakistan)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[Khan Abdul Wali Khan|Khan Vali Khan]] saw Bhutto's actions as his last stand against PNA, the Armed Forces and Bhutto, including his colleagues, were isolated.&lt;ref name="wikiquote"&gt;{{cite web |title=There is one possible grave for two people ... let us see who gets in first |url=http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Zulfikar_Ali_Bhutto |accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2016}} In an open public seminar, Vali Khan quoted that "There is one possible grave for two people ... let us see who gets in first".&lt;ref name="wikiquote"/&gt; The [[Federal Security Force]] allegedly either arrested or extrajudicially killed members of the Muslim League.&lt;ref name="People's Party and Lahore."/&gt; Following this, amid protest and civil distress felt in [[Lahore]], and People's Party lost the administrative control over the city.&lt;ref name="People's Party and Lahore."/&gt;

===Military coup===
On 3 July 1977, then-[[Major-General]] [[Khalid Mahmud Arif|K.M. Arif]] secretly met Bhutto, revealing that the planning of a coup had been taking place in the General Combatant Headquarters (GHQ).&lt;ref name="Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (July 2005)"/&gt; At this secret meeting, General Arif encouraged Bhutto to "rush the negotiation with the PNA, before its too late".&lt;ref name="Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (July 2005)"/&gt; Intensifying political and civil disorder prompted Bhutto to hold talks with PNA leaders, which culminated in an agreement for the dissolution of the assemblies and fresh elections under a government of national unity.&lt;ref&gt;Mazari, Sherbaz (2000) ''A Journey into disillusionment''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0195790766}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 5 July 1977 Bhutto and members of his cabinet were arrested by troops under the order of General Zia.&lt;ref name="USCS" /&gt; It is generally believed that the coup took place on the pretext of unrest despite Bhutto having reached an agreement with the opposition.&lt;ref name="People's Party and Lahore."/&gt;

Bhutto had good intelligence within the Army, and officers such as Major-General [[Tajammul Hussain Malik|Tajamül Hussain Malik]] were loyal to him until the end.&lt;ref name="People's Party and Lahore."/&gt; However, General Zia-ul-Haq ordered a training programme with the officers from [[Special Air Service]] (SAS).&lt;ref name="People's Party and Lahore."/&gt; General Zia-ul-Haq ordered many of Bhutto's loyal officers to attend the first course.&lt;ref name="People's Party and Lahore."/&gt; However, classes for senior officers were delayed until the midnight.&lt;ref name="People's Party and Lahore."/&gt; None of the officers were allowed to leave until late in the evening before the coup. During this time, arrangements for the coup was made.&lt;ref name="People's Party and Lahore."/&gt;

General Zia announced that martial law had been imposed, the constitution suspended and all assemblies dissolved and promised elections within ninety days. Zia also ordered the arrest of senior PPP and PNA leaders but promised elections in October. Bhutto was released on 29 July and was received by a large crowd of supporters in his hometown of Larkana. He immediately began touring across Pakistan, delivering speeches to very large crowds and planning his political comeback. Bhutto was arrested again on 3 September before being released on bail on 13 September. Fearing yet another arrest, Bhutto named his wife, [[Nusrat Bhutto|Nusrat]], president of the Pakistan People's Party. Bhutto was imprisoned on 16 September and a large number of PPP leaders, notably Dr. [[Mubashir Hassan]] and activists were arrested and disqualified from contesting the elections. Observers noted that when Bhutto was removed from power in July 1977, thousands of Pakistanis cheered and were delighted.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Herald (Published in Dawn News)"&gt;{{cite news|author=Husain, Irfan |title=Living to Bhutto's Ghost|url=http://www.pakistanherald.com/Articles/Living-with-Bhuttoand8217s-ghost-1529|accessdate=25 December 2012|newspaper=Pakistan Herald |date= 4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrests and trial===
{{See also|Operation Fair Play}}
On 5 July 1977 the military, led by General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], staged a coup. Zia relieved prime minister Bhutto of power, holding him in detention for a month. Zia pledged that new elections would be held in 90 days. He kept postponing the elections and publicly retorted during successive press conferences that if the elections were held in the presence of Bhutto his party would not return to power again.

Upon his release, Bhutto travelled around the country amid adulatory crowds of PPP supporters. He used to take the train from the south to the north, and en route would address public meetings at different stations. Several of these trains were late, some by days, in reaching their respective destinations and as a result Bhutto was banned from traveling by train. The last visit he made to the city of [[Multan]] in the province of Punjab marked the turning point in Bhutto's political career and ultimately, his life. In spite of the administration's efforts to block the gathering, the crowd was so large that it became disorderly, providing an opportunity for the administration to declare that Bhutto, along with Dr. Hassan, had been taken into custody because the people were against him and it had become necessary to protect him from the masses for his own safety.

On 3 September, the Army arrested Bhutto again on charges of authorising the murder of a political opponent in March 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Frank | first = Katherine | authorlink = Katherine Frank | year = 2002 | title = Indira: The Life of Indira Nehru Gandhi | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | location = US | isbn = 978-0-395-73097-3 | page = 438}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 35-year-old politician [[Ahmed Raza Kasuri]] and his family had been ambushed, leaving Kasuri's father, Nawab Muhammad Ahmad Khan Kasuri, dead. Kasuri claimed that he was the actual target, accusing Bhutto of orchestrating the attack. Kasuri later claimed that he had been the target of 15 assassination attempts. Bhutto's wife [[Nusrat Bhutto]] assembled a team of top Pakistani lawyers for Bhutto's defence, led by [[Fakhruddin G. Ebrahim]], Yahya Bakhtiar and [[Abdul Hafiz Pirzada|Abdulhafiz Pirzada]]. Bhutto was released 10 days after his arrest after a judge, Justice KMA Samdani, found the evidence to be "contradictory and incomplete." As a result, Justice Samdani was immediately removed from the bench and placed at the disposal of the law ministry. Three days later Zia arrested Bhutto again on the same charges, this time under "martial law." When the PPP organised demonstrations among Bhutto's supporters, Zia cancelled the upcoming elections.

Bhutto was arraigned before the [[Lahore High Court|High Court]] of [[Lahore]] instead of in a lower court, thus depriving him of one level of appeal. The judge who had granted him bail had been removed. Five new judges were appointed, headed by Chief Justice of Lahore High Court [[Maulvi Mushtaq Hussain]].&lt;ref name="Chowk.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Aqil |first=Tariq |title=Judicial Murder of a Prime Minister |publisher=Chowk.com |date=7 December 2004 |url=http://www.chowk.com/Views/History/Judicial-Murder-of-a-Prime-Minister |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903040459/http://www.chowk.com/Views/History/Judicial-Murder-of-a-Prime-Minister |archivedate=3 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hussain had previously served as Bhutto's Foreign secretary in 1965, and was alleged to have strongly disliked and distrusted Bhutto.&lt;ref name="Chowk.com"/&gt; Hussain was a not only a Zia appointee but hailed from his home Jullundur district.&lt;ref name=talbot-258&gt;{{cite book|last1=Talbot|first1=Ian|title=Pakistan, a Modern History|date=1998|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=NY|pages=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial lasted five months, and [[Bhutto]] appeared in court in a dock specially built for the trial. Proceedings began on 24 October 1977. Masood Mahmood, the director general of the Federal Security Force (since renamed the [[Federal Investigation Agency]]), testified against Bhutto. Mahmood had been arrested immediately after Zia's coup and had been imprisoned for two months prior to taking the stand. In his testimony, he claimed Bhutto had ordered Kasuri's assassination and that four members of the Federal Security Force had organised the ambush on Bhutto's orders. The four alleged assassins were arrested and later confessed. They were brought into court as "co-accused" but one of them recanted his testimony, declaring that it had been extracted from him under torture. The following day, the witness was not present in court and the prosecution claimed that he had suddenly "fallen ill".

Bhutto's defence team fought the case efficiently and challenged the prosecution with evidence from an army logbook the prosecution had submitted.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} It showed that the jeep allegedly driven during the attack on Kasuri was not even in Lahore at the time. The prosecution had the logbook disregarded as "incorrect". During the  cross-examination by the defence of witnesses, the bench often interrupted questioning. The 706-page official transcript contained none of the objections or inconsistencies in the evidence pointed out by the defence.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Former [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Ramsey Clark]] called it a [[mock trial]] fought in a [[Kangaroo court]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Having witnessed the trial, Clark later wrote:

{{quote|The prosecution's case was based entirely on several witnesses who were detained until they confessed, who changed and expanded their confessions and testimony with each reiteration, who contradicted themselves and each other, who, except for Masood Mahmood... were relating what others said, whose testimony led to four different theories of what happened, absolutely uncorroborated by an eyewitness, direct evidence, or physical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hassan, PhD (Civil engineering)|first=Mubashir|title=Mirage of Power§ Zulfi Bhutto: a man lives within enemies|year=2000|publisher=The Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When Bhutto began his testimony on 25 January 1978, Chief Justice Maulvi Mushtaq closed the courtroom to all observers. Bhutto responded by refusing to say any more. Bhutto demanded a retrial, accusing the Chief Justice of bias, after Mushtaq allegedly insulted Bhutto's home province. The court refused his demand.&lt;ref name="Chowk.com"/&gt;

===Death sentence and appeal===
[[File:Mausoleum of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto.jpg|thumb|[[Mausoleum of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and other Bhutto family members in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh, Sindh]]

On 18 March 1978, Bhutto was declared not guilty of murder, but was sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;PLD 1978 Lahore 523 (Criminal Original Case No. 60 of 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"&gt;{{cite web |last=Zaman |first=Fakhar |title=Pakistan Peoples Party: A Past and Present |website=Fakhar Zaman |publisher=Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:8-F45KofrfAJ:ppp.org.au/Downloads/chronology.pdf+abdul+hafiz+pirzada+zulfiqar+ali+bhutto&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgtRU8K1jr6GLjLTZ-aBe8Bci9mwF17RuhqiAI4THyLpKswkT2jucoZtAqlCnDMqvgzT14uY8rkTnSYgubG7FuUADQtKoqONcCMD39ZCPipfH3eT9e_x9GO1bmiVAfmYbYjHGR3&amp;sig=AHIEtbTUmfHU2M4VvhMBgWWGExvp0BFBXA |format=Google docs | accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 12 March 1978, Bhutto's former Legal Minister, [[Abdul Hafiz Pirzada]] petitioned the Supreme Court for the release of Bhutto's Science Adviser, Mubashir Hassan, and to review Bhutto's death sentence based on the split decision.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt; The Supreme Court denied Hassan's release because he was held by Military Police, but the court agreed to hear the arguments.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt; After 12 days of proceedings, the Supreme Court concluded that the President of Pakistan can change a death sentence into life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt; Pirzada filed an application to then-Chief Martial Law Administrator.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt; However, General Zia-ul-Haq did not act immediately and claimed that the application had gone missing.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt;

Emotionally shattered, Pirzada informed Bhutto about the development and General Zia-ul-Haq's intention.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt; Therefore, Bhutto did not seek an appeal.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt; While he was transferred to a cell in [[Rawalpindi]] central jail, his family appealed on his behalf, and a hearing before the Supreme Court commenced in May. Bhutto was given one week to prepare. Bhutto issued a thorough rejoinder to the charges, although Zia blocked its publication. Chief Justice [[S. Anwarul Haq]] adjourned the court until the end of July 1978, supposedly because five of the nine appeal court judges were willing to overrule the Lahore verdict. One of the pro-Bhutto judges was due to retire in July.

Chief Justice S. Anwarul Haq presided over the trial, despite being close to Zia, even serving as Acting President when Zia was out of the country. Bhutto's lawyers managed to secure Bhutto the right to conduct his own defence before the Supreme Court. On 18 December 1978, Bhutto made his appearance in public before a packed courtroom in Rawalpindi. By this time he had been on death row for 9 months and had gone without fresh water for the previous 25 days.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} He addressed the court for four days, speaking without notes.

The appeal was completed on 23 December 1978. On 6 February 1979, the Supreme Court issued a guilty verdict,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nasirlawsite.com/historic/pld79.htm PLD 1979 SC 53] (Criminal Appeal No. 11 of 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; a decision reached by a bare 4-to-3 majority. The Bhutto family had seven days in which to appeal. The court granted a stay of execution while it studied the petition. By 24 February 1979 when the next court hearing began, appeals for clemency arrived from many heads of state. Zia said that the appeals amounted to "trade union activity" among politicians.

On 24 March 1979 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal. Zia upheld the death sentence. Bhutto was hanged at [[Central Jail Rawalpindi]], on 4 April 1979, and was buried in Village Cemetery at Garhi Khuda Baksh.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11724172 Zulifikar Ali Bhutto's Memorial Page] at [[Find A Grave]]. Retrieved 16 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his imprisonment, Bhutto's children [[Murtaza Bhutto|Murtaza]] and Benazir worked on rallying the international support for the release of their father.&lt;ref name="Tahir Khalil, special correspondent to the Middle East Evens (Text only in Urdu)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Khalil|first=Tahier|title=Gaddafi made an enormest effort for Bhutto's release|url=http://jang.com.pk/jang/oct2011-daily/21-10-2011/main.htm|website=Tahir Khalil of Jang Media Group|publisher=Tahir Khalil, special correspondent to the Middle East Evens (Text only in Urdu)|accessdate=21 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021164217/http://jang.com.pk/jang/oct2011-daily/21-10-2011/main.htm|archivedate=21 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Libya]]'s [[Muammar Gaddafi|Colonel Gaddafi]] sent his Prime minister [[Abdessalam Jalloud|Abdus Salam Jalloud]] on an emergency trip to Pakistan to hold talks with Pakistan's military establishment for the release of Bhutto.&lt;ref name="Tahir Khalil, special correspondent to the Middle East Evens (Text only in Urdu)"/&gt; In a press conference, Jalloud told the journalists that Gaddafi had offered General Zia to exile him to Libya, and Prime minister Jalloud stayed in the [[Islamabad International Airport]] where the specially designated [[Air transports of heads of state and government|Presidential aircraft]] waited for Bhutto.&lt;ref name="Tahir Khalil, special correspondent to the Middle East Evens (Text only in Urdu)"/&gt; However, after a week of staying at the airport, General Zia rejected Prime minister Jalloud's request and upheld the death sentence.&lt;ref name="Tahir Khalil, special correspondent to the Middle East Evens (Text only in Urdu)"/&gt; Much of the [[Muslim world]] was shocked at Bhutto's execution.&lt;ref name="Tahir Khalil, special correspondent to the Middle East Evens (Text only in Urdu)"/&gt; Before being hanged, Bhutto made a final speech and his last words were: "Oh Lord, help me for...

On 4 April 1979, the day Bhutto was executed, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published its report after following the entire chronological events surrounding Bhutto's trial which stated in part "The way they did it, (Bhutto).. is going to grow into a legend that will some day backfire."&lt;ref name="The New York Time (article published in 1979) and Sani H.

===Effects on Soviet Union and the United States===
{{See also|Soviet–Afghan War|Operation Cyclone}}
Many political analysts and scientists widely suspected that the riots and coup against Bhutto were orchestrated with the help of [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the [[United States Government]] because of United States fears of Bhutto's socialist policies being seen as sympathetic to the [[Soviet Union]], and said policies providing an opportunity to the Soviet Union to get involved in Pakistani politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Panhwar, Member of Sindh Provincial Assembly. |first=Sani |title=CIA Sent Bhutto to the Gallows |website=Sani H. Panhwar and The New York Times. |publisher=The New York Time (article published in 1979) and Sani H.

Panhwar, member of Sindh Provincial Assembly and Party representative of Pakistan People's Party. "/&gt; as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not believe in conspiracy theories in general, but the similarities in the staging of riots in Chile (where the CIA allegedly helped overthrow President [[Salvador Allende|Salvadore Allende]]) and in Pakistan are just too close. Bhutto was removed from power in Pakistan by force on 5 July, after the usual party on the 4th at the [[U.S. Embassy, Islamabad|U.S. Embassy in Islamabad]], with U.S. approval, if not more, by General Zia-ul-Haq. Bhutto was falsely accused and brutalized for months during proceedings that corrupted the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Judiciary of Pakistan]] before being murdered, then hanged. As Americans, we must ask ourselves this: Is it possible that a rational military leader under the circumstances in Pakistan could have overthrown a constitutional government, without at least the tacit approval of the United States?.&lt;ref name="The New York Time (article published in 1979) and Sani H. Panhwar, member of Sindh Provincial Assembly and Party representative of Pakistan People's Party. "/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of Pakistan's political scientists and historians and leading U.S. experts such as Ramsey Clark believed that Bhutto's removal and his execution was a singular and most dramatic change in world politics and a major setback for the Soviet Union who failed to realize the effects of Bhutto's execution on its own future in advance. Bhutto's death not only was a turning point in the [[Cold War]], it also turned out to be one of the critical points in world politics since World War II, and a breakthrough in global power alignment. Eight months after Bhutto's death, the Soviet Union [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|invaded]] the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan Soviet Socialist Republic]], setting up a war that severely impacted the [[Soviet economy]] and led to the [[Disintegration of the Soviet Union|dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the United States emerging as the [[Superpower|single most powerful country in the world]].&lt;ref name="The New York Time (article published in 1979) and Sani H. Panhwar, member of Sindh Provincial Assembly and Party representative of Pakistan People's Party. "/&gt;

===Re-opening of the Bhutto trial===
On 2 April 2011, 32 years after Bhutto's trial and execution, the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] (the [[ruling party]] at that time) filed a petition at the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] to reopen Bhutto's trial. At the ''[[Geo News]]'', senior journalist [[Iftikhar Ahmad (journalist)|Iftikhar Ahmad]] [[television broadcasting|aired]] a series of televised interviews with those who played a major and often controversial role in Bhutto's death. A legal team was organized by the Prime Minister [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]]'s [[Gillani ministry|cabinet]] seeking to reopen the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=pakistan8217s-cabinet-seeks-to-reopen-bhutto8217s-murder-case-2011-03-29 |title=Cabinet to seek to re-open the case |website=Hürriyet Daily News |date=29 March 2011 |accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Asif Ali Zardari]] gave his consent to the resulting presidential order named Article 186 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court taking up the petition on 13 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Pakistan|Article 186(a) in the Part VII— The Judicature, Constitution of Pakistan]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]] [[Iftikhar Chaudhry]] eventually presided the three-judge-bench (although it was expanded with law experts from [[Administrative units of Pakistan|four provinces]] of Pakistan), while [[Law Minister of Pakistan|Minister of Law]] [[Babar Awan]] counseled Bhutto's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/04/13/awan-quits-his-ministerial-post-to-counsel-zab-case.html |title=CJ likely to appoint 10 amici curiae in ZAB reference |work=Dawn |date=13 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110418221630/http://www.dawn.com/2011/04/13/awan-quits-his-ministerial-post-to-counsel-zab-case.html |archivedate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With immediate effect, [[Babar Awan]] resigned as [[Law Minister of Pakistan|Law minister]], even leaving the [[Ministry of Justice (Pakistan)|Justice ministry]] entirely in order to legally counsel Bhutto's case completely independently. In his noting remarks, [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]] [[Iftikhar Chaudhry|Chaudhry]] praised and appreciated the move by the senior PPP leadership and remarked the gesture as "historic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/NewsDetail.aspx?ID=14074 | title=Babar Awan resigns to plead Bhutto case|work=thenews.com.pk|date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a crucial advancement, the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] ordered the decision on the legal status of Bhutto's execution to a to-be-formed larger bench.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2011/04/14/zab-case-sc-decides-to-form-new-bench/ |title=ZAB case: SC decides to form new bench |publisher=The News Tribe |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a series of hearings at the Supreme Court, the case was adjourned and dismissed after the [[Pakistan Peoples Party|PPP]] approved the suspension of [[Babar Awan]] on 2 May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pakistanconstitutionlaw.com/order-in-bhutto-reference-case/ Order], 17 January 2012 (Reference No. 1 of 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Bhutto married twice in his lifetime. His first marriage took place in 1943 when he married his cousin and first wife Shireen Amir Begum. In 1951, he married Begum Nusrat Ispahani on September 8, 1951. The couple had  four children; [[Benazir Bhutto|Benazir]], [[Murtaza Bhutto|Murtaza]], Sanam, [[Shahnawaz Bhutto|Shahnawaz]].

There was also news of an alleged affair between Bhutto and a Bengali girl named Husna Sheikh. According to some media reports, she was his secret wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.indiatoday.in/story/husna-sheikh-zulfikar-ali-bhuttos-secret-wife/1/435809.html Husna Sheikh: Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's Secret Wife – India Today]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Foundation Stone Gomal University ZABhutto.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Cornerstone|foundation stone]] is built by the [[Gomal University]] in the honour of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto of Pakistan.]]

Bhutto remains a controversial and largely discussed figure in Pakistan. While he was hailed for his nationalism, Bhutto was roundly criticized for intimidating his political opponents. By the time Bhutto was given the control of his country in 1971, Pakistan was torn apart, isolated, demoralized, and emotionally shattered after a psychological and bitter defeat at the hands of its bitter rival India.&lt;ref name="Dr. Anwar Syed, and Daily times "&gt;{{cite web |last=Syed, PhD |first=Anwar |title=Analysis: The legacy of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto |website=Daily Times|date=12 April 2011 |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2011\04\12\story_12-4-2011_pg3_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His political rivals had blamed his socialist policies for slowing down Pakistan's economic progress, as they caused poor productivity and high costs. However Bhutto and co{{who|date=September 2015}} countered that they were merely addressing the massive inequality built up over the Ayub Khan years.&lt;ref name="Professor"/&gt;

Bhutto is blamed by some quarters for causing the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. In 1977, General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] released former general [[Yahya Khan]] from prison and his Lieutenant-General [[Fazle Haq]] gave him the honorary guard of honor when the former general died in 1980.&lt;ref name="Professor"/&gt; After being released from house arrest after the 1977 coup Yahya said, "It was Bhutto, not Mujib, who broke Pakistan. Bhutto's stance in 1971 and his stubbornness harmed Pakistan's solidarity much more than Sheikh Mujib's six-point demand. It was his high ambitions and rigid stance that led to rebellion in East Pakistan. He riled up the Bengalis and brought an end to Pakistan's solidarity. East Pakistan broke away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Halim |first=Parvez |date=9 March 2011 |title=Bhutto broke Pakistan, not Mujib |url=http://www.probenewsmagazine.com/index.php?index=2&amp;contentId=5049 |newspaper=Probe News Magazine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324203948/http://www.probenewsmagazine.com/index.php?index=2&amp;contentId=5049 |archive-date=24 March 2012 |access-date=26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other army men who lay blame for 1971 on Bhutto  include future President [[Pervez Musharraf]] and East Pakistan's former Martial Law Administrator [[Syed Mohammad Ahsan]].&lt;ref name=Dawn&gt;Cowasjee, Ardeshir (17 September 2000). "[http://www.dawn.com/news/1072331/gen-agha-mohammad-yahya-khan-4 Gen Agha Mohammad Yahya Khan – 4]". ''Dawn''.&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutto is also often criticised for human-rights abuses in Baluchistan by [[Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal|hardline Islamists]] as well as [[Pakistan Muslim League|conservatives]].&lt;ref name="USCS"/&gt; Bhutto's actions during the [[1970s operation in Balochistan]] are also criticised for failing to bring about a lasting peace in the region.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Bhutto's international image is more positive, casting him as a secular [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]]. Domestically, despite the criticism, Bhutto still remains Pakistan's most popular leader.&lt;ref name="USCS" /&gt; During his premiership, Bhutto succeeded in uniting all the parties in getting the 1973 constitution enacted.&lt;ref name="Dr. Anwar Syed, and Daily times "/&gt; His determined and aggressive embrace of nuclear weapons for Pakistan has made him regarded as the father of Pakistan's nuclear-deterrence programme, which he pursued in spite of Pakistan's limited financial resources and strong opposition from the United States.&lt;ref name="International Institute for Strategic Studies through the 2006 dossier.

(1979) ''White House Years''. Simon &amp; Schuster. {{ISBN|1451636431}} (2011 edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

While, Bhutto's former Law Minister Mairaj Muhammad Khan described Bhutto as "a great man but cruel".&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Mairaj Muhammad, Former Minister of Manpower and Labour under Bhutto, as quoted in Lamb, Christina (1991) ''Waiting for Allah''.

[[Roedad Khan]], former statesman who served under Bhutto, further wrote in his book, ''Pakistan—A dream gone sour'', that after 1971, Bhutto started extremely well, bringing the isolated, angered, apprehended, and dismembered nation back into her feet and gave the respectable place in the world, in a shortest period... With a gift of giving the nation a parliamentary system and furthermore the ambitious successful development of [[Nuclear power in Pakistan|atomic bomb programme]] in a record time, are his greatest achievements in his life, for Pakistan and her people, but sadly deteriorated at the end".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pakistan A Dream Gone Sour|url=http://www.defencejournal.com/dec98/pakdream.htm|last=Khan |first=Roedad |accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhutto remains highly influential in country's public, scientific, and political circles; his name yet continues to resonate in Pakistan's collective memory.&lt;ref name="Pakistan Herald (Published in Dawn News)"/&gt;
