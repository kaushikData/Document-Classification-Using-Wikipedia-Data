'''Afghanistan Liberation Organization''' ({{lang-fa|سازمان  رهایی افغانستان}}, ''Sazman-i Rihayi Afghanistan'', ALO) is a [[Maoism|Maoist]] political group in [[Afghanistan]]. It was founded by Dr. [[Faiz Ahmad]] and some others in 1973. ALO is one of several organization that grew out of the ''Sholaye Javid'' (Eternal Flame) movement. ALO was originally named '''Revolutionary Group of the Peoples of Afghanistan''' (گروه انقلابی خلقهای افغانستان, RGPA);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=tXQ6j9LqU9IC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=%22afghanistan+liberation+organization%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22afghanistan%20liberation%20organization%22|title=Politics of the Dispossessed: Superpowers and Developments in the Middle East|last=Emadi|first=Hafizullah|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780275973650|location=|pages=34|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was renamed in 1980.

==History==
It was highly critical of the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] and actively fought against what it considered [[social imperialism]]. In June 1979, RGPA convened the [[Mujahedin Freedom Fighters Front of Afghanistan]] together with Islamist elements, as a [[united front]] against the pro-Soviet government.

Along with some other Islamist groups, RGPA directed a rebellion in [[Kabul]] and other cities on August 5, 1979, that became known as the [[Bala Hissar uprising]]. The uprising was suppressed by the government and tens of ALO cadres were killed and arrested. Some of the central committee members like Mohammad Mohsin, Mohammad Dawod and others were executed in the [[Pul-e-Charkhi prison]].

ALO had many fronts against the Soviets and pro-Soviet Afghan communists in different parts of Afghanistan and was attacked by both the Soviet forces and the fundamentalist groups of Mujahideen. They lost over 120 of its cadres during the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://a-l-o.maoism.ru/photos_s/martyred.htm Martyred Cadres of the Afghanistan Liberation Organization (ALO)&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=April 2016}}

===Decline===
Dr. Faiz Ahmad himself was assassinated on November 12, 1986, along with his 6 other comrades by the [[Islamic Party of Afghanistan|Hizb-e Islami]] militia of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]].

==Current Status==
More recently, ALO has directed its energies towards opposing the American occupation of Afghanistan and the regime of President [[Hamid Karzai]].

The '''Australian Series System''' is an [[archival]] control or [[metadata]] system, used primarily to describe records in the custody of archival institutions.

It was developed at the [[National Archives of Australia|Australian Archives]] in the 1960s and forms the basis for the Australian Society of Archivists' committee on descriptive standards guide ″Describing archives in context″.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Clive Smith | title=The Australian Series System | publication-date=1995 | publisher=Association of Canadian Archivists | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/5569798 | accessdate=30 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hurley|first=Chris|title=The Australian ('Series') System: An Exposition|year=1994|url=http://infotech.monash.edu/research/groups/rcrg/publications/chtrc1.html|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Australian Society of Archvists Committee on descriptive standards|title=Describing archives in context: a guide to Australasian practice|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is noted for its separation of data about record-keeping and context&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Hurley, Chris | title=What, if anything, is the Australian "Series" System? | publication-date=2008 | publisher=Chris Hurley | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/193428312 | accessdate=30 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, by structuring an archive's organisation through individually describing separate "Context entities" for:
* Records (the bunch of documents);
* Agents (the persons or organisations that create and manage the Records); and/or,
* Functional Provenance (the business the Agents do).
In this the traditional [[Respect des fonds]] and [[original order]] are both incorporated and extended, particularly useful where an original function is maintained by differing agents through time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Bettington, Jackie et al., eds. | title=Keeping Archives 3rd Edition | publication-date=2008 | publisher= Australian Society of Archivists Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The trough could be rock-cut, wood-lined or clay-lined to ensure it was watertight.  [[Radiocarbon dating|Radiocarbon dates]] vary quite widely, the earliest being [[late Neolithic]], with clusters of dates between 1900–1500 BC and 1200–800 BC, with some outliers in the [[Iron Age]].  There are also some dates that go into the [[early Medieval]] period. The technology used at burnt mounds has much greater antiquity and is found from the palaeolithic onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Purpose==
The shattered rock fragments are thought to be the remains of stones heated in fires, which were used to heat water for cooking, bathing, dyeing or leather treatment.  The shattering of the rock appears to have been the result of [[thermal shock]] when the heated stones were dropped into liquid, normally believed to be water.  The mound is assumed to result from the periodic clearing out of the trough, with the stone fragments and [[charcoal]] being cast up into a mound.  The mound is frequently a [[crescent]] shape, which is seen as being the result of the upcast.

==Locations==
The vast majority of burnt mounds are found in the uplands of Britain, and in Ireland where they are called ''[[fulacht fiadh|fulachtaí fia]]''.  Recognised from the nineteenth century onwards, they attracted little significant interest until the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Barfield 1987 370–379"&gt;{{cite book

However, this may be illusory, as examples have been found at lower altitudes during linear route excavations.  The reason that they had not been recognised before was that the mounds have been ploughed out, although the trough may partially survive and there will be layers of the burnt mound material surviving as a spread of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

, but there is no trough to explain the shattering of the rocks.

The upland bias in distribution in Britain has led to a suggestion that they were cooking sites for hunting parties, and there are images from Medieval Irish texts that appear to show this.  There are also descriptions of the use of such features for cooking in some of the early Medieval tales,&lt;ref name="O Drisceoil 1990 157–164"/&gt; although the historicity of these accounts is open to question.  The burnt mounds are always adjacent to water courses, and there can be several instances along the same burn or stream.

There has been considerable debate about the time required to create the mounds.  Some interpretations posit the rapid accumulation of material, as a trough was used intensively and very frequently; others suggest a slower accumulation, where the trough was used occasionally over a long period of time.  The hunting site explanation would most likely result in the latter pattern of accumulation, while the former would suggest that the use of the trough was for an essentially domestic purpose.

==Possible explanations==
The main explanation for burnt mounds is that they were cooking sites.  However, there are problems with such explanations, not the least of which is the lack of any [[direct evidence]] of cooking.  The process undoubtedly works; experiments were carried out in Ireland in the 1950s to show that a joint of meat could be fully cooked in about three to four hours through this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | journal =  Trans Royal Ir Acad
  | volume = 18
  | pages = 105–155
  | year = 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, bone is rarely if ever reported from burnt mound sites, which would be unusual for a cooking site.  This has been explained as the result of the soils being too acidic for the bone to be preserved, but this is unsatisfactory.  It would be rather unlikely that all of the soils relating to burnt mounds were so acidic that no bone survived, particularly as the pH of the soil will vary considerably from site to site.  However, there are examples of burnt mounds that have been recorded on neutral or basic soils, without bone being apparent in the burnt mound material,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | journal =  Burnt Mounds &amp; Hot Stone Technology (ed) Hodder, M A &amp; Barfield, L H
  | pages = 59–67
  | year = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatives that have been suggested include saunas (where the intention is to create steam rather than cook anything), fulling, [[Edible salt|salt production]], leather preparation etc.&lt;ref name="Barfield 1987 370–379"/&gt;

The implication found in many accounts of burnt mounds gives the impression that they are found in Ireland and Scotland, but they also are found in Wales and in England.  The Welsh examples tend to be upland and rural,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | authorlink = Buckley, Victor (ed)
  | title = Welsh Contributions
  | journal =  Burnt Offerings 
  | pages = 117–140
  | year = 1990
  | isbn = 1-869857-07-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are many of the English ones, but there are also many found in the lowlying [[English Midlands]].  Barfield &amp; Hodder's interpretation of burnt mounds as potentially saunas arose from their various excavations of burnt mounds in the Birmingham area, while more recently forty mounds have been discovered in [[Birmingham]].&lt;ref name=bhamcc&gt;*[http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/Media/Moseley%20Bog%20handout.pdf?MEDIA_ID=70278&amp;FILENAME=Moseley%20Bog%20handout.pdf&amp;NOCACHE=TRUE Birmingham City Council leaflet by planning archaeologist] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306181136/http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/Media/Moseley%20Bog%20handout.pdf?MEDIA_ID=70278&amp;FILENAME=Moseley%20Bog%20handout.pdf&amp;NOCACHE=TRUE |date=March 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is in [[Moseley Bog]] where experiments were made in the late 1990s to assess the plausibility of the sauna hypothesis.

==Burnt mounds outside Britain and Ireland==
Burnt mound material is also found outside Britain and Ireland, and examples have been found elsewhere in [[North-West Europe|northwestern Europe]], such as in Sweden &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Similar material has been produced all over the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A '''business necessity''' is a legitimate [[business]] purpose that justifies an employment decision as effective and needed to optimally achieve the organization’s goals and ensure that operations run safely and efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, W. F., &amp; Aguinis, H. (2010). Applied Psychology in Human Resource Management,  Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; This is often presented as a defense of an employment decision that is questioned because it was found to cause [[disparate impact]].

== Feature films ==

=== ''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs'' (2009) ===
{{Main article|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)}}

Flint Lockwood invents a machine that transforms water into food called the "Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator" (FLDSMDFR). Flint turns on the FLDSMDFR in his laboratory, but ends up overloading the house's electrical supply. He then decides to power the machine by hooking it up to a nearby power plant. When he turns the machine back on, it ends up rocketing through town, causing various damage, ultimately shooting up into the sky. While recovering from his failure, Flint meets Samantha "Sam" Sparks, a weather intern whose big break was foiled by Flint's actions. Their conversation is cut short when rainbow colored clouds float over the town and begin to rain cheeseburgers.

=== ''Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2'' (2013) ===
{{Main article|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2}}

Upon arriving back at Swallow Falls, they notice that a jungle-like environment made of food has overgrown the island. Tim stays behind while Flint and the others investigate, finding a vast habitat of living food animals called foodimals and meet a cute strawberry nicknamed Barry. Tim, searching for sardines at his abandoned tackle shop, encounters a family of humanoid pickles and bonds with them by fishing. Chester discovers that Flint allowed his friends to join him on the mission, so he travels to the island with Barb, chagrined and determined to separate them, and he arrives just in time to save them from a Cheespider. Flint then finds his old lab and invents a device to find the FLDSMDFR. After escaping a Tacodile attack, Sam notices that the foodimal was protecting its family, and begins to suspect Chester is up to no good. Sam attempts to convince Flint to spare the foodimals, but Flint is intent on impressing Chester. Sam leaves in anger, and Flint's other companions go with her. In the jungle, Manny confirms Sam's suspicions when he reverses the Live Corp logo to reveal the "Live" as "Evil" spelled backwards. In addition, Sam proves that the foodimals mean no harm by taming a Cheespider. They also learn that the foodimals had known the truth about Live Corp before. Upon realizing Chester's intentions, the group is then ambushed by Evil Corp employees.

[[Image:Garcia-orta-coloquios.png|thumb|right|Title page of Garcia de Orta's ''Colóquios'' first edition, from the [[Printing in Goa|first printing press in India]] at [[Saint Paul's College, Goa]] on 10 April 1563, by João de Endem]]

'''''Colóquios dos simples e drogas he cousas medicinais da Índia''' e assi dalgũas frutas achadas nella onde se tratam algũas cousas tocantes a medicina, pratica, e outras cousas boas pera saber'' ("Conversations on the simples, drugs and materia medica of India and also on some fruits found there, in which some matters relevant to medicine, practice, and other matters good to know are discussed") is a work of great originality published in [[Goa]] on 10 April 1563 by [[Garcia de Orta]], a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Jewish]] physician and naturalist, a pioneer of [[tropical medicine]].

==Outline of the ''Colóquios''==
Garcia de Orta's work is in dialogue format. It consists of a series of 57 conversations between Garcia de Orta and an imaginary colleague, Ruano, who is visiting India and wishes to know more about its drugs, spices and other natural products. Occasional participants in the dialogue are apparently real people:

* Antonia, a slave, Garcia de Orta's research assistant
* Several unnamed slaves
* D. Jeronimo, brother of a cholera sufferer
* Dimas Bosque, a colleague who also contributes a preface to the book
* Malupa, an Indian physician

In general the drugs are considered in alphabetical order, but with exceptions. Each of the substances that comes up for discussion is dealt with fairly systematically: its identification and names in earlier texts, its source, its presence in trade, its medical and other uses. Many case histories are mentioned. The discussion of [[Asiatic cholera]] is so complete and circumstantial that it constitutes a classic of clinical description.&lt;ref&gt;Dialogue 17 {{Harv|Roddis|1931|p=203}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Digressions, more or less relevant, deal with Indian politics, the significance of [[China]], the rivalries between Portugal and Spain in the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. There are anecdotes about [[elephant]]s, [[cobra]]s, and [[mongoose]].

==Authorities cited==
"Don't try and frighten me with Diocorides or Galen," Garcia de Orta says to Ruano, "because I am only going to say what I know to be true."&lt;ref&gt;Dialogue 9 {{Harv|Boxer|1963|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though unusually ready to differ from earlier authorities on the basis of his own observations, Garcia was well read in the classics of medicine. As a sample, the following authors (listed here in the spellings preferred by Garcia) are regularly cited in the first 80 folia of the ''Colóquios'':

* [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''[[Hippocrates|Hipocrate]], [[Theophrastus|Teofrasto]], [[Dioscorides|Dioscoride]], [[Galen]]o''
* [[Classical Latin]]: ''[[Celsus|Celso]], [[Pliny the Elder|Plinio]]''
* [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''[[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Rasis]], [[Avicenna|Avicena]], [[Masawaih al-Mardini|Mesue]], [[Serapion the Younger|Serapion]]''
* Medieval Latin: ''[[Gherardo da Cremona|Gerardo Cremonensis]], [[Matthaeus Silvaticus|Matheus Silvatico]]''
* Later Latin: ''[[Andrea Alpago|Andreas Belunensis]], [[Andrés Laguna]]'' (aka ''Tordelaguna'')'', [[Joannes Manardus|Menardo]], [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli|Mattioli]]'' (aka ''Matheolo Senense'')'', [[Antonius Musa Brassavola|Antonio Musa]], [[Ioannes Ruellius|Ruelio]]'' and Garcia's younger contemporary ''[[Amato Lusitano]]''

Garcia also occasionally quotes ''[[Aristotle|Aristotele]], [[Averroes|Averroe]], [[Plutarch|Plutarco]], [[Marcus Valerius Probus|Valerio Probo]], [[Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda|Sepulveda]], [[Francisco de Tamara]], [[Ludovico di Varthema|Vartamano]], [[Vesalius|Vesalio]]''; also ''[[Joannes Actuarius|Autuario]]'', a medieval Greek author known to him through a Latin translation by [[Ioannes Ruellius|Ruelio]].

Garcia felt able to differ from these authorities, as he very frequently does, because he was a long way from Europe. "If I was in Spain [Spain in his time was the geographical designation for the [[Iberian Peninsula]] that includes Portugal] I wouldn't dare to say anything against Galen and the Greeks;" this remark has been seen as the real key to the ''Colóquios''.&lt;ref&gt;Dialogue 32 {{Harv|Ficalho|1886|p=309}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The original edition of the ''Colóquios''==
Goa was by no means a major publishing centre, although the first printing press in India was introduced there in 1556; in the words of historian [[C. R. Boxer|Charles Ralph Boxer]], the original edition of the ''Colóquios'' "probably contains more typographical errors than any other book ever issued from a printing-press". The errata consisted of twenty pages and noted that it was probably incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boxer|1963|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Garcia's printer is thought to have been João de Endem who began his career with Joao Quinquenio de Campania.&lt;ref name=primrose&gt;{{cite journal|author=Primrose, J.B.|title=The first press in India and its printers|journal=Library|year=1939|volume=20|issue=3|pages=241–265|doi= 10.1093/library/s4-XX.3.241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original publication states very carefully the extent of its official backing. The title page carries the approval of the [[Viceroy]] and of the local [[Inquisitor]] "Alexos Diaz Falcam". The book opens with several commendatory letters and prefaces. Among these preliminaries, the one that is of most interest now is a poem, the first published verses by Garcia's friend [[Luís de Camões]], now recognised as Portugal's national poet.

Many of the printing errors and authorial oversights are silently corrected in the 1872 reprint, which, although it follows the original page-for-page, is not a facsimile.

==Reception of the ''Colóquios''==
Garcia de Orta was the first European to catalogue Indian medicinal herbs in their native habitat. His book was rapidly acknowledged as indispensable by scientists across Europe. Translations in [[Latin]] (then the scientific lingua franca) and other languages were made. The Latin translation, a slight abridgement dropping the dialogue format, but adding woodcut illustrations and editorial commentary, was by [[Charles de l'Écluse]] (Carolus Clusius). Clusius acquired his copy of the ''Colóquios'' at Lisbon on 28 December 1564,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boxer|1963|loc=plate 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and evidently continued to work on it all his life. In its final (fifth) edition, his translation forms a part of his great collaborative work, ''[[Exoticorum libri decem]]'' (1605).

Unluckily for the fame of Garcia da Orta's book, large parts of it were included with minimal acknowledgement in a similar work published in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in 1578 by [[Cristóbal Acosta]], ''Tractado de las drogas y medicinas de las Indias orientales'' ("Treatise of the drugs and medicines of the East Indies"). Da Costa's work was widely translated into vernacular languages and eventually lessened the fame of Garcia de Orta except among the few who were aware of the latter's originality.

There is an English translation of the ''Colóquios'' by Sir [[Clements Markham]] (1913) which included an introductory biography.

A "'''Doom painting'''" or "Doom" is a traditional English term for a wall-painting of the [[Last Judgment]] in a medieval church.  This is the moment in [[Christian eschatology]] when Christ judges souls to send them to either [[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]] or [[Christian views on Hell|Hell]].&lt;ref&gt;"doom: A painting of the Last Judgment on the chancel arch of a medieval parish church."--E. Lucie-Smith, ''The Thames &amp; Hudson Dictionary of Art Terms'' (1984); p. 68.  The term remains capitalized, as the proper name of a specific incident more often than not.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The subject was very commonly painted on a large scale on the western wall of churches, so it was viewed as people left the church, and the term is typically used of these, rather than depictions of the ''Last Judgement'' in other locations or media. Many examples survive as wall-paintings in medieval churches, most dating from around the 12th to 13th centuries, although the subject was common from the 1st millennium until (in countries remaining Catholic) the [[Counter-Reformation]].  Most dooms in English churches were destroyed by government authority during the [[English Reformation]].

The most famous of all Doom paintings, [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|''The Last Judgment'' by Michelangelo]] in the [[Sistine Chapel]], painted in 1537 to 1541, comes at the end of the tradition, and is unusually sited on the east wall behind the altar.

==The term "Doom"==
Doom or "the Doom" was a specific term for the Last Judgement and first cited to c. 1200 by the [[OED]] ("doom", 6), a sense surviving in this artistic meaning and in phrases such as the "crack of doom" and the word "doomsday", the latter going back to [[Old English]].  The original OED in the late 19th century already described this sense of "doom" as "archaic", but it remains in use in descriptions of (mostly) British medieval churches.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] "doom", 6; "doomsday"&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Purpose and iconography==
Dooms were encouraged by the early medieval Church as an instrument to highlight the contrasts between the reward of Heaven and the agony of Hell so as to guide Christians away from misbehaviour and sin. A Doom was usually positioned either on the rear (liturgical Western) wall, if that space was available, or at the front ([[Chancel#Chancel|Chancel]] end) of a church, often on the Chancel arch itself so that it would be constantly visible to worshippers as they faced the altar during services.

Although there are many different versions, the composition stays broadly the same. On the left side of a Doom painting (that is, on Christ's right hand) is Heaven, whilst on the right (Christ's left) is Hell. At the top of the image Jesus Christ sits in glory with his (proper - i.e. on the left to the viewer) right hand encouraging the saved up and his left hand pointing down to Hell for the damned.  Typically flanking him is the [[Virgin Mary]] on his right and [[John the Apostle]] on his left, sometimes with the twenty-four elders mentioned in the [[Book of Revelation]] encircling the three of them. The angels blow trumpets to raise the dead for judgment. Commonly [[Michael (archangel)|the Archangel Michael]] is in the centre, with the [[Weighing scale|scales]] he will use to weigh the souls of humanity to see if individually they are fit for Heaven: one person is on one side of the scale while [[demon]]ic creatures that represent the sins committed by the person are on the other side of the scale. The creatures try to tip the scales in their favour while, in some versions of the painting, the Virgin Mary places a rosary next to the person she wishes to protect, or puts her hand on the scale to counterbalance the demons. In some other versions, while one of the saved enters Heaven, a demon tries to pull them in with the damned, while an [[Guardian Angel|angel]] fights the demon for the soul.

Those who are worthy are brought to the gates of Heaven, frequently represented by a castle with large walls built to keep out sinful impurities. This is most commonly depicted on the left hand side of Doom paintings. Groups of angels adorn the walls of Heaven celebrating the [[Salvation|saved]] as they approach Heaven's gates, where [[Saint Peter]] waits with his keys.

Those on the other side are deemed unworthy of Heaven, usually seized by demons and brought into the [[Hellmouth]], beyond which, mostly out of sight, lie the bowels of hell.

A decisive factor in the Doom or Last Judgement will be the question, if the corporal [[works of mercy]] were practiced or not during lifetime. They rate as important acts of charity. Therefore, and according to the biblical sources (Mt 5:31-46), the conjunction of the Last Judgement and the [[works of mercy]] is very frequent in the pictorial tradition of Christian art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralf van Bühren]], ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23753234.2017.1287283 Caravaggio’s ‘Seven Works of Mercy’ in Naples. The relevance of art history to cultural journalism]'', in ''Church, Communication and Culture'' 2 (2017), pp. 63-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Chaldon in Surrey the west wall of the church has a painting of the Ladder of Salvation (a subject common in the Eastern Church but this is the only example in England). This painting dates from about 1200 and is 17.5 ft long and 11.21 ft high.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, L. E. (1960) ''What to See in a Country Church''. London: Phoenix House; pp. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Chaldon|church of Saints Peter and Paul]], Chaldon, (built before 1086 AD) contains a large wall painting of around 1170 depicting images of the ways of salvation and damnation and their result &lt;ref&gt;Executed in accordance with a scheme originating in the Eastern Orthodox Church, preserved to us in the 'Guide to Painting of the Greek Church,' as used by the monk-painters of the monasteries of [[Mount Athos]] whose title is "The Ladder of the Salvation of the Human Soul and the Road to Heaven"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[National security]]''' has a number of component '''elements''' which, when individually satisfied, provide a nation with [[security]] of its values, interests and freedom to choose policy. These are listed differently by various authorities. Besides the military aspect of security, the aspects of [[politics]], [[society]], [[Natural environment|environment]], [[energy]] and [[natural resources]], and, [[economics]] are commonly listed. The elements of national security correlate closely to the concept of the [[elements of national power]].

==Choice of elements==
As in the case of [[national power]], the [[military capability|military aspect]] of security is an important, but not the sole, component of national security. To be truly secure, a nation needs other forms of security. Authorities differ in their choice of nation security elements.

===Romm===
[[Joseph J. Romm]], an American physicist, climate change and energy security expert, in his 1993 book ''Defining national security: the nonmilitary aspects'' takes Ullman's 1983 definition of threat as a starting point and lists security from narcotic cartels, economic security, environmental security and energy security as the non-military elements of national security.&lt;ref name="Romm 1993"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Defining national security: the nonmilitary aspects |last=Romm |first=Joseph J.|authorlink=Joseph J. Romm |coauthors= |year=1993 |publisher=Council on Foreign Relations |location= |series=Pew Project on America's Task in a Changed World (Pew Project Series) |isbn=978-0-87609-135-7 |page= |pages=122 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=shxDOnuVcyYC |accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|v, 1–8}}

===Paleri===
[[Prabhakaran Paleri]], an [[India]]n academician, lists a larger number of elements in his book ''National Security: Imperatives And Challenges'' (2008):&lt;ref name="Paleri"&gt;{{cite book |title=National Security: Imperatives And Challenges |last=Paleri |first=Prabhakaran |authorlink=Prabhakaran Paleri |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-0-07-065686-4 |page= |pages=521 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMzcGe0-HQwC |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|66}}

* [[Economic security]]
* [[Resource security]]

* [[Geostrategic security]]
* [[Informational security]]
* [[Food security]].
* [[Health security]]
* [[Ethnic security]]
* [[Environmental security]]
* [[Cyber security]]
* [[Genomic security]]

Paleri has chosen these elements keeping in mind that each term should be a fundamentally whole concept, universally applicable, of macro-level social impact and  directly affecting human life; continuously under threat; uninterrupted in continuity from its origin in its existence, even though this may be periodic; and, currently in vogue in the current language of natural security, in addition to a number of other attributes.&lt;ref name="Paleri"/&gt;{{rp|65–66}} Paleri also examines and rejects certain terms, commonly found in discussions on national security, such as "homeland security", "terrorism", "social security" etc.&lt;ref name="Paleri"/&gt;{{rp|74}}

'''Expert shopping''' is the practice of finding an [[Expert|authority]] on a given subject whose professional opinion is skewed toward the answer that the searching party already prefers. This is commonplace in the [[news media]], [[politic]]s, and [[business]], though can be found in all walks of life.

Another well-known use is in [[lawsuit]]s, when an [[expert witness]] can be paid to testify in favor of one side of the case. In this case, the expert witnesses on each side may have totally different opinions.{{DEFAULTSORT:Expert Shopping}}

A '''final clause''' in [[linguistics]] is a dependent adverbial [[clause]] expressing purpose. For this reason it is also referred to as a ''purposive clause'' or a ''clause of purpose''.

In [[English language|English]], final clauses are relatively rare. A final clause is a reply to a question containing the question word ''wherefore'' or ''what for'' (sometimes also ''why''). The [[Prescription and description|prescription]] for their construction is rather complicated:

A final [[clause]] is introduced by the following linking words ([[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]]): 
* '''that''' (sometimes preceded by ''in order'' or ''so'', or, in literary language, ''to the end'')
* '''lest''' (equivalent to ''that not'', sometimes with the meaning ''for fear that'', both of these naturally belonging to the ''that'' category)

Depending on the conjunction used, two forms of final clause exist:
* if ''that'' is used, the final clause takes '''may''' in the [[present tense|present]] and [[future tense|future]], and '''might''' in the [[past tense|past]], sometimes also '''[[shall]]''' because of the [[Latin]] subjunctive
** Wherefore do you play the violin? &amp;ndash; I play the violin ''that'' I ''may'' enjoy myself.
** What did you hit me for? &amp;ndash; I hit you ''so that'' they ''might'' not become suspicious of us.
** Why did you go to the city? &amp;ndash; I went to the city ''in order that'' I ''might'' buy some new clothes in the shopping centre.
** I grabbed the rope ''that'' I ''might'' ''not'' fall.
* if ''lest'' is used, the final clause takes '''should''' or '''may''' (the latter being obsolescent, and used only for the present and the future), or the [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]].
** I grabbed the rope ''lest'' I ''should'' fall.
** I play the violin ''lest'' I ''should'' (or ''may'') be bored.
** He does what he is told ''lest'' he ''be'' sacked. (subjunctive)
** He used the subjunctive lest they thought him uncouth. (past subjunctive, which appears the same in UK English as the past)

Final clauses that refer to the same subject as the main clause of the sentence can be expressed with ''to'', ''in order to'', ''so as to'', ''for fear of'', et cetera. This 'short form' of the final clause is much more common than the final clause itself.
* She reads that she may be wise. = She reads to be wise.
* You cried for fear that you might not have impressed the examiners. = You cried for fear of not impressing the examiners.
* I paint in order that I may be happy. = I paint to be happy.

Karsten Schmidtke-Bode examined final clauses, in the context of purpose clauses, as intended to bring about a specific [[matrix clause]] situation in a [[complex sentence]] construction. There are recurring trends of grammatical coding across many languages. It is common for languages to have purpose clauses expressed in different strategies. Purpose clause topological mapping aims to explain the universal conceptual characteristics of [[morphosyntactic]] coding in the communicative functions, as well as the [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive-psychological]] mechanisms involved in the use. Purpose clauses differ from typical [[adverbial]] relations, and are a special case which, is closely related to [[complement clause]]s and some [[relative clauses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Purpose, as a simple grammatical [[infinitive]], follows verbs that express or imply motion in English, according to Hubert Gibson Sharin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Libby Gallery]]At [[Stetson University]], [[DeLand, Florida]], Libby developed the curriculum for a number of upper division interdisciplinary courses for a new major in the arts and humanities. He also worked with Fred Messersmith  AWS, chairman of the Department of Art, in developing a series of exhibitions that explored the careers of artists from the United States and abroad who painted in [[Florida]] from post-Civil War to [[World War I]].  While at Stetson, Libby published a number of articles in academic journals including the Italian Quarterly and Paideuma.

He also began his study of Cuban historic artists in the Fulgencio Batista Collection of Cuban art housed at the Cuban Foundation Museum, [[Museum of Arts and Sciences (Daytona Beach)|Museum of Arts and Sciences]], [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. Libby’s “Artistic Taste in Pre-Castro Cuba “ was one of the lead papers presented  at the Southeastern Museum Conference, Charleston, South Carolina, 1975. That paper became the foundation of two books Libby authored. (''Two Centuries of Cuban Art: 1759-1959'', a soft cover bi-lingual catalog, published by the Ringling Museum of Art, with essays interpreting works of art from the Batista Collection exhibition, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;See Archives John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, Two Centuries of Cuban Art: 1759-1959. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Libby curated the exhibition at the [[John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art]], [[Sarasota]], [[Florida]], with additional works from the [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[New York City|New York]]; [[The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], [[New York City|New York]], and the Museum of Modern Art of Latin America, [[Washington, DC]]. ''Cuba-A History in Art'', University Press of Florida, 1997, revised edition 2015.)

At [[Stetson University]], Libby served as Secretary of the Faculty Senate and acting University Art Archivist. In 1975, he was elected as a Trustee at the Museum of Arts and Sciences, [[Daytona Beach]], [[Florida]], and became a Charter Member of the International Society of Fine Art Appraisers, Ltd.

In 1977, Libby was hired as the Executive Director of the Museum of Arts and Sciences which became accredited by the [[American Alliance of Museums]] and a Smithsonian Affiliate under Libby’s leadership. The Museum grew from one location of 7,000 sq. ft. to 120,000 sq. ft. with three different locations. Libby was also selected for and completed one of the first classes of the Smithsonian Institution’s Museum Leadership and Management Certification Program directed by Jane Glaser. At the Museum, Libby organized and led the first international museum travel program in [[Florida]]. This annual program introduced cultural treasures in [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], [[South America]], [[Europe]], [[Scandinavia]], North and Equatorial [[Africa]], the [[Middle East]], [[Asia]] and [[Australia]] to thousands of central Floridians who attended these interpreted educational and cultural expeditions.  At his 2002 retirement, the Trustees of the Museum of Arts and Sciences named Libby as the first Director Emeritus and named the Lobby of the Museum as the “Gary R. Libby Entry Court.” A Trustee-led community-wide effort also raised nearly one million dollars to endow the Gary R. Libby Curator of Art position at the Museum of Arts and Sciences.

Libby continues to teach and lecture at Stetson University as a Visiting Professor /Guest Curator and also guest lectures for the Honors College at the [[University of Florida]] as Adjunct Lecturer.

'''Hypertime''' is a [[fiction]]al concept in [[DC Comics]] which first appeared in the 1999 ''[[The Kingdom (comic)|The Kingdom]]'' limited series. It is a variation of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] concept that existed in DC Comics before ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''. 

==Concept==
Hypertime is a network of alternate timelines that branch off from the [[DC Universe]]. These timelines sometimes overlap with each other, causing alterations in reality. Characters can cross from one timeline to another if needed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Kingdom'' #2 (Feb. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''52''===
[[Mister Mind]], disguised as [[Skeets (DC Comics)|Skeets]], refers to [[Waverider (comics)|Waverider]] as "the seer of Hypertime".&lt;ref&gt;''52'' Week Twenty-Seven (Nov. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Booster Gold''===
An older [[Booster Gold]], while explaining his duties to his son [[Rip Hunter]], mentions the concept of Hypertime.&lt;ref&gt;''Booster Gold'' (vol. 2) #30 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Multiversity''===
Hypertime is used to explain the formation and alteration of the 52 universes formed at the end of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Multiversity Guidebook'' (March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Rebirth''===
Hypertime has been mentioned several times in the Prime Earth continuity.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash'' (vol. 5) #22 (May 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' (vol. 3) #25 (July 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Linguistics}}
'''Linguistic rights''' are the [[human rights|human]] and [[civil rights]] concerning the individual and collective [[right]] to choose the language or languages for communication in a private or public atmosphere. Other parameters for analyzing linguistic rights include the degree of territoriality, amount of positivity, orientation in terms of assimilation or maintenance, and overtness.&lt;ref&gt;Extra, G., and Yağmur, K. (2004). "Language rights perspectives".&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic rights include, among others, the right to one's own language in legal, administrative and judicial acts, language education, and media in a language understood and freely chosen by those concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M., &amp; Hornberger, N.H. (2016). Re-visiting orientations to language planning: problem, right, and resource. ''Bilingual Review/La revista bilingüe, 33''(3), 30–49. Available from http://bilingualreview.utsa.edu/index.php/br/article/view/118&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic rights in international law are usually dealt in the broader framework of [[cultural rights|cultural]] and [[right to education|educational rights]].

Important documents for linguistic rights include the [[Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights]] (1996), the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] (1992), the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (1989) and the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] (1988), as well as [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention against Discrimination in Education]], Article 5&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (1966).&lt;ref&gt;[[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 27&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Linguistic rights became more and more prominent throughout the course of history as language came to be increasingly seen as a part of nationhood. Although policies and legislation involving language have been in effect in early European history, these were often cases where a language was being imposed upon people while other languages or dialects were neglected. Most of the initial literature on linguistic rights came from countries where linguistic and/or national divisions grounded in linguistic diversity have resulted in linguistic rights playing a vital role in maintaining stability.&lt;ref&gt;Kymlicka, Will and Patten, Alan. (2003). "Introduction: Language Rights and Political Theory: Context, Issues and Approaches." In Will Kymlicka and Alan Patten (eds.), Language Rights and Political Theory(pp1-51): Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the 1900s that linguistic rights gained official status in politics and international accords.&lt;ref&gt;Bruthiaux, Paul. (2008). "Language rights in historical and contemporary perspective." Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development, 30(1), 73–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic rights were first included as an international human right in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948.

Formal treaty-based language rights are mostly concerned with [[minority rights]]. The history of such language rights can be split into five phases.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas, Phillipson, and Rannut, 1994"&gt;Skutnabb-Kangas, Tove, Phillipson, Robert, and Rannut, Mart. (1994). "Linguistic human rights: overcoming linguistic discrimination." Walter de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Pre-1815. Language rights are covered in bilateral agreements, but not in international treaties, e.g. [[Treaty of Lausanne]] (1923).
# Final Act of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815). The conclusion to [[Napoleon I]]'s empire-building was signed by 7 European major powers. It granted the right to use Polish to Poles in Poznan alongside German for official business. Also, some national constitutions protects the language rights of national minorities, e.g. Austrian Constitutional Law of 1867 grants ethnic minorities the right to develop their nationality and language.
# Between World I and World War II. Under the aegis of the [[League of Nations]], Peace Treaties and major multilateral and international conventions carried clauses protecting minorities in Central and Eastern Europe, e.g., the right to private use of any language, and provision for instruction in primary schools through medium of own language.&lt;ref name="Caporti,1979"&gt;Caporti, Francesco. (1979). "Study of the Rights of Persons Belonging to Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities." New York: United Nations.&lt;/ref&gt; Many national constitutions followed this trend. But not all signatories provided rights to minority groups within their own borders such as United Kingdom, France, and US. Treaties also provided right of complaint to League of Nations and [[International Court of Justice]].
# 1945–1970s. International legislation for protection of human rights was undertaken within infrastructure of [[United Nations]]. Mainly for individual rights and collective rights to oppressed groups for self-determination.
# Early 1970s onwards, there was a renewed interest in [[minority rights|rights of minorities]], including language rights of minorities. e.g. UN Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities.

==Theoretical discussion==

===Language rights + human rights = linguistic human rights (LHR)===
Some make a distinction between language rights and linguistic human rights because the former concept covers a much wider scope.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt; Thus, not all language rights are LHR, although all LHR are language rights. One way of distinguishing language rights from LHR is between what is necessary, and what is enrichment-oriented.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt; Necessary rights, as in human rights, are those needed for basic needs and for living a dignified life, e.g. language-related identity, access to mother tongue(s), right of access to an official language, no enforced language shift, access to formal primary education based on language, and the right for minority groups to perpetuate as a distinct group, with own languages. Enrichment rights are above basic needs, e.g. right to learn foreign languages.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt;

===Individual linguistic rights===
The most basic definition of linguistic rights is the right of individuals to use their language with other members of their linguistic group, regardless of the status of their language. They evolve from general human rights, in particular: non-discrimination, freedom of expression, right to private life, and the right of members of a linguistic minority to use their language with other members of their community.&lt;ref name="Varennes,2007"&gt;Varennes, Fernand de. (2007). "Language Rights as an Integral Part of Human Rights – A Legal Perspective". In Koenig, Matthias, Guchteneire, Paul F. A. (eds), ''Democracy and human rights in multicultural societies'' (pp 115–125): Ashgate Publishing Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual linguistic rights are provided for in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]:
* Article 2 – all individuals are entitled to the rights declared without discrimination based on language.
* Article 10 – individuals are entitled to a fair trial, and this is generally recognized to involve the right to an interpreter if an individual does not understand the language used in criminal court proceedings, or in a criminal accusation. The individual has the right to have the interpreter translate the proceedings, including court documents.
* Article 19 – individuals have the right to [[freedom of expression]], including the right to choose any language as the medium of expression.
* Article 26 – everyone has the [[right to education]], with relevance to the language of medium of instruction.
Linguistic rights can be applied to the private arena and the public domain.

====Private use of language====
Most treaties or language rights documents distinguish between the private use of a language by individuals and the use of a language by public authorities.&lt;ref name="Varennes,2007"/&gt; Existing international human rights mandate that all individuals have the right to private and family life, freedom of expression, non-discrimination and/or the right of persons belonging to a linguistic minority to use their language with other members of their group. The [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] defines privacy as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"... the sphere of a person's life in which he or she can freely express his or her identity, be it by entering into relationships with others or alone. The Committee is of the view that a person's surname [and name] constitutes an important component of one's identity and that the protection against arbitrary or unlawful interference with one's privacy includes the protection against arbitrary or unlawful interference with the right to choose and change one's own name."&lt;ref name="Varennes,2007"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This means that individuals have the right to have their name or surname in their own language, regardless of whether the language is official or recognised, and state or public authorities cannot interfere with this right arbitrarily or unlawfully.&lt;br&gt;

====Linguistic rights in the public domain====
The public domain, with respect to language use, can be divided into judicial proceedings and general use by public officials.&lt;br&gt;

According to Article 10 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], individuals have the right to a fair trial. Therefore, in the name of fairness of judicial proceedings, it is an established linguistic right of an individual to an interpreter when he or she does not understand the language used in criminal court proceedings, or in a criminal accusation. The public authorities must either use the language which the individual understands, or hire an interpreter to translate the proceedings, including court cases.

General use by public officials can cover matters including public education, public radio and television broadcasting, the provision of services to the public, and so on. It is often accepted to be reasonable and justified for public officials to use the language of minorities, to an appropriate degree and level in their activities, when the numbers and geographic concentration of the speakers of a minority language are substantial enough. However, this is a contentious topic as the decision of substantiation is often arbitrary. The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], Article 26, does promise to protect all individuals from discrimination on the grounds of language. Following that, Article 27 declares, "[[minority group|minorities]] shall not be denied the right... to use their own language".&lt;ref name="International Covenant"&gt;Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. "International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights". March 23, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Convention against Discrimination in Education]], Article 5, also does declares the rights for minorities to "use or teach their own language".&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention against Discrimination in Education]], Article 5, (c)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collective linguistic rights===
Collective linguistic rights are linguistic rights of a group, notably a language group or a [[state (polity)|state]]. Collective rights mean "the right of a linguistic group to ensure the survival of its language and to transmit the language to future generations".&lt;ref name="Chen, 1998"&gt;Chen, Albert H. Y. "The Philosophy of Language Rights." Language Sciences, 20(1), 45–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Language groups are complex and more difficult to demarcate than states.&lt;ref name="Coulmas, 1998"&gt;Coulmas, Florian. (1998). "Language Rights – Interests of State, Language Groups and the Individual." Language Sciences,20(1), 63–72.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this difficulty is that members within language groups assign different roles to their language, and there are also difficulties in defining a language.&lt;ref name="Coulmas, 1998"/&gt; Some states have legal provisions for the safeguard of collective linguistic rights because there are clear-cut situations under particular historical and social circumstances.&lt;ref name="Coulmas, 1998"/&gt; &lt;br&gt;

Collective linguistic rights apply to states because they express themselves in one or more languages.&lt;ref name="Coulmas, 1998"/&gt; Generally, the language régime of states, which is communicated through allocation of statuses to languages used within its boundaries, qualifies linguistic rights claimed by groups and individuals in the name of efficient governance, in the best interest of the [[common good]].&lt;ref name="Coulmas, 1998"/&gt; States are held in check by international conventions and the demands of the citizens. Linguistic rights translate to laws differently from country to country, as there is no generally accepted standard legal definition.&lt;ref name="Paulston, 1997"&gt;Paulston, Christina Bratt. "Language Policies and Language Rights". Annual Review Anthropology, 26, 73–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Territoriality vs. personality principles===
The principle of territoriality refers to linguistic rights being focused solely within a territory, whereas the principle of personality depends on the linguistic status of the person(s) involved.&lt;ref name="Paulston, 1997"/&gt; An example of the application of territoriality is the case of [[Switzerland]], where linguistic rights are defined within clearly divided language-based cantons. An example of the application of personality is in federal [[Canadian legislation]], which grants the right to services in French or English regardless of territory.&lt;br&gt;

===Negative vs. positive rights===
[[Negative and positive rights|Negative linguistic rights]] mean the right for the exercise of language without the interference of the [[Sovereign state|State]].&lt;ref name="Chen, 1998"/&gt; Positive linguistic rights require positive action by the State involving the use of public money, such as public education in a specific language, or state-provided services in a particular language.&lt;ref name="Chen, 1998"/&gt;

===Assimilation-oriented vs. maintenance-oriented===
Assimilation-oriented types of language rights refer to the aim of the law to assimilate all citizens within the country, and range from prohibition to toleration.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt; An example of prohibition type laws is the treatment of [[Kurds]] in [[Turkey]] as well as [[Turkish language|Turks]] in [[Iran]], where they are forbidden to use the Kurdish and Turkish languages respectively. Maintenance-oriented types of language rights refer to laws aiming to enable the maintenance of all languages within a country, and range from permission to promotion. An example of laws that promote language rights is the Basque Normalization Law, where the Basque language is promoted. The neutral point between assimilation-orientation and maintenance-orientation is non-discrimination prescription, which forbids discrimination based on language.

===Overt vs. covert===
Another dimension for analyzing language rights is with degree of overtness and covertness.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt; Degree of overtness refers to the extent laws or covenants are explicit with respect to language rights, and covertness the reverse. For example, Indian laws are overt in promoting language rights, whereas the English Language Amendments to the US Constitution are overt prohibition. The [[Charter of the United Nations]], the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and the UN [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] all fall under covert toleration.

===Criticisms of the framework of linguistic human rights===
Some have criticized linguistic rights proponents for taking language to be a single coherent construct, pointing out instead, the difference between language and speech communities, and putting too much concern over inter-language discrimination rather than intra-language discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Blommaert, J. (ed.) 1999. "Language Ideological Debates". Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blommaert, J. 2001. "The Asmara Declaration as a sociolinguistic problem: Reflections on scholarship and linguistic rights". Journal of Sociolinguistics 5(1): 131–142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blommaert, J. 2001. "Review of T. Skutnabb-Kangas' Linguistic genocide in education – or worldwide diversity and human rights?" Applied Linguistics 22(4): 539–541.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silverstein, M. 1998. "Contemporary transformation of local linguistic communities". Annual Review of Anthropology 27: 401–426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wee, L. (2005). "Intra-Language Discrimination and Linguistic Human Rights: The Case of Singlish". Applied Linguistics 26(1): 48–69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Other issues pointed out are the assumptions that the collective aims of linguistic minority groups are uniform, and that the concept of collective rights is not without its problems.&lt;ref&gt;May, S. (2001). "Language and Minority Rights: Ethnicity, Nationalism and the Politics of Language". London: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

There is also the protest against the framework of Linguistic Human Rights singling out minority languages for special treatment, causing limited resources to be distributed unfairly. This has led to a call for deeper ethnographic and historiographic study into the relationship between speakers' attitudes, speakers' meaning, language, power, and speech communities.&lt;ref&gt;Stroud, C. (2001). "African mother-tongue programmes and the politics of language: Linguistic citizenship versus linguistic human rights". Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development 22(4): 339–355.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stroud, C. (2002). "Framing Bourdieu socio-culturally: Alternative forms of linguistic legitimacy in postcolonial Mozambique". Multilingual 21: 247–273.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical application==
Linguistic rights manifest as legislation (the passing of a law), subsequently becoming a statute to be enforced.&lt;ref name="Siegel,2006"&gt;Siegel, Lawrence. (2006). "The Argument for a Constitutional Right to Communication and Language". Sign Language Studies,6(1),255–272.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paulston,1997a"&gt;Christina Bratt Paulston. (1997). "Language Policies and Language Rights". Annual Review Anthropology,26,73–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Language legislation delimiting official usage can by grouped into official, institutionalizing, standardizing, and liberal language legislation, based on its function.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"&gt;Skutnabb-Kangas, Tove. (2000). "Linguistic Genocide in Education – or Worldwide Diversity and Human Rights?" Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"Official legislation makes languages official in the domains of legislation, justice, public administration, and education, [commonly according to territoriality and personality]. Various combinations of both principles are also used.... Institutionalizing legislation covers the unofficial domains of labour, communications, culture, commerce, and business...."&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In relation to legislation, a causal effect of linguistic rights is [[language policy]]. The field of language planning falls under language policy. There are 3 types of language planning: status planning (uses of language), acquisition planning (users of language), and corpus planning (language itself).&lt;ref name="Paulston, 1997"/&gt;

===Language rights at international and regional levels===

====International platform====
{{See also|Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights|International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|Convention on the Rights of the Child}}
The Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights was approved on 6 June 1996 in Barcelona, Spain. It was the culmination of work by a committee of 50 experts under the auspices of [[UNESCO]]. Signatories were 220 persons from over 90 states, representing NGOs and International PEN Clubs Centres. This Declaration was drawn up in response to calls for linguistic rights as a fundamental human right at the 12th Seminar of the International Association for the Development of Intercultural Communication and the Final Declaration of the General Assembly of the International Federation of Modern Language Teachers. Linguistic rights in this Declaration stems from the language community, i.e., collective rights, and explicitly includes both regional and immigrant minority languages. &lt;br&gt;

Overall, this document is divided into sections including: Concepts, General Principles, Overall linguistic regime (which covers Public administration and official bodies, Education, Proper names, Communications media and new technologies, Culture, and The socioeconomic sphere), Additional Dispositions, and Final Dispositions. So for instance, linguistic rights are granted equally to all language communities under Article 10, and to everyone, the right to use any language of choice in the private and family sphere under Article 12. Other Articles details the right to use or choice of languages in education, public, and legal arenas.&lt;br&gt;

There are a number of other documents on the international level granting linguistic rights. The UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1966 makes international law provision for protection of minorities. Article 27 states that individuals of linguistic minorities cannot be denied the right to use their own language. &lt;br&gt;

The UN [[Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities]] was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1992. Article 4 makes "certain modest obligations on states".&lt;ref name="Extra and Yağmur,2004"&gt;Extra, G., and Yağmur, K. (2004). "Language rights perspectives". In Extra, G. and Yağmur, K. (Eds.), Urban Multilingualism in Europe: Immigrant Minority Languages at Home and School (pp. 73–92): Multilingual Matters Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; It states that states should provide individuals belonging to minority groups with sufficient opportunities for education in their mother tongue, or instruction with their mother tongue as the medium of instruction. However, this Declaration is non-binding.&lt;br&gt;

A third document adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1989, which makes provisions for linguistic rights is the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In this convention, Articles 29 and 30 declare respect for the child's own cultural identity, language and values, even when those are different from the country of residence, and the right for the child to use his or her own language, in spite of the child's minority or immigrant status.&lt;br&gt;

====Regional platform====

=====Africa=====
{{See also|List of Linguistic Rights in Constitutions (Africa)}}
Linguistic rights in Africa have only come into focus in recent years. In 1963, the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) was formed to help defend the fundamental human rights of all Africans. It adopted in 1981 the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]], which aims to promote and protect fundamental human rights, including language rights, in Africa. In 2004, fifteen member states ratified the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights Establishing the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights. The Court is a regional, legal platform that monitors and promotes the AU states' compliance with the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. It is currently pending a merger with the [[African Court of Justice|Court of Justice of the African Union]].

In 2001 the President of the Republic of Mali, in conjunction with the OAU, set up the foundation for the [[African Academy of Languages]] (ACALAN) to "work for the promotion and harmonisation of languages in Africa". Along with the inauguration of the Interim Governing Board of the ACALAN, the [[African Union]] declared 2006 as the [[Year of African Languages]] (YOAL).&lt;ref&gt;African Academy of Languages. (2010). Historical Survey of ACALAN. Retrieved November 9, 2010, from http://www.acalan.org/eng/aboutacalan/historique.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the OAU was disbanded and replaced by the African Union (AU). The AU adopted the Constitutive Act previously drawn up by the OAU in 2000. In Article 25, it is stated that the working languages of the Union and its institutions are Arabic, English, French and Portuguese, and if possible, all African languages. The AU also recognizes the national languages of each of its member institutions as stated in their national constitutions. In 2003, the AU adopted a protocol amending the Act such that working languages shall be renamed as official languages, and would encompass Spanish, Kiswahili and "any other African language" in addition to the four aforementioned languages . However, this Amendment has yet to be put into force, and the AU continues to use only the four working languages for its publications.

=====Europe=====
{{See also|European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages|Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities|List of Linguistic Rights in Constitutions (Europe)}}
The [[Council of Europe]] adopted the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in 1950, which makes some reference to linguistic rights. In Article 5.2, reasons for arrest and charges have to be communicated in a language understood by the person. Secondly, Article 6.3 grants an interpreter for free in a court, if the language used cannot be spoken or understood.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Convention,1950"&gt;Council of Europe. (1950). Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. from http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The Council for Local and Regional Authorities, part of the Council of Europe, formulated the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in 1992.&lt;ref name="Charter,1992"&gt;Council of Europe. (1992). European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. from http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; This Charter grants recognition, protection, and promotion to regional and/or minority languages in European states, though explicitly not immigrant languages, in domains of "education, judicial authorities, administrative and public services, media, cultural activities, and socio-economic life"&lt;ref name="Extra and Yağmur,2004"/&gt; in Articles 8 to 13. Provisions under this Charter are enforced every three years by a committee. States choose which regional and/or minority languages to include.&lt;br&gt;

The Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities was implemented by the Council of Europe in 1995 as a "parallel activity"&lt;ref name="Extra and Yağmur,2004"/&gt; to the Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. This Framework makes provisions for the right of national minorities to preserve their language in Article 5, for the encouragement of "mutual respect and understanding and co-operation among all persons living on their territory",&lt;ref name="Framework,1995"&gt;Council of Europe. (1995). Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. from http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/157.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of language, especially in "fields of education, culture and the media"&lt;ref name="Framework,1995"/&gt; in Article 6. Article 6 also aims to protect persons from discrimination based on language. &lt;br&gt;

Another document adopted by the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly in 1998 is the Recommendation 1383 on Linguistic Diversification.&lt;ref name="Recommendation 1383,1998"&gt;Parliamentary Assembly – Council of Europe. (1998). Recommendation 1383 (1998) – Linguistic diversification. from http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta98/EREC1383.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; It encourages a wider variety of languages taught in Council of Europe member states in Article 5. It also recommends language education to include languages of non-native groups in Article 8.

===Language rights in different countries===

====Australia====
{{See also|Australian Aboriginal languages}}
[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann]] et al. (2014) proposed the enactment of "Native Tongue Title", an ex gratia compensation scheme for the loss of indigenous languages in Australia: "Although some Australian states have enacted ex gratia compensation schemes for the victims of the [[Stolen Generations]] policies, the victims of [[language death|linguicide]] (language killing) are largely overlooked ... Existing grant schemes to support Aboriginal languages ... should be complemented with compensation schemes, which are based on a claim of '''right'''. The proposed compensation scheme for the loss of Aboriginal languages should support the effort to reclaim and revive the lost languages.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 55 of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]], Shakuto-Neoh, Shiori &amp; Quer, Giovanni Matteo (2014), [http://www.professorzuckermann.com/#!native-tongue-title/cufd Native Tongue Title: Proposed Compensation for the Loss of Aboriginal Languages], ''Australian Aboriginal Studies'' 2014/1: 55–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 2017, the [[New South Wales]] (NSW) parliament passed a legislation that recognises and revives indigenous languages for the first time in Australia's history. "The NSW Government will appoint independent panel of Aboriginal language experts" and "establish languages centres".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-11/nsw-passes-unprecedented-laws-to-revive-indigenous-languages/9039746 NSW introduces nation's first laws to recognise and revive Indigenous languages], Bridget Brennan, ABC, October 11, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Austria====
{{See also|Constitution of Austria}}
Under the Austrian Constitutional Law (1867), Article 8(2) grants the right to maintenance and development of nationality and language to all ethnic minorities, equal rights to all languages used within the regions in domains of education, administration and public life, as well as the right to education in their own language for ethnic communities, without the necessity of acquiring a second language used in the province.&lt;ref name="OBVG,2000"&gt;Federal Assembly. (2000). Austrian Federal Constitutional Laws (selection).Herausgegeben vom Bundespressedienst.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
{{See also|Constitution of Canada}}
The [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] (1982) grants positive linguistic rights, by guaranteeing state responsibility to the French and English language communities. Section 23 declares three types of rights for Canadian citizens speaking French or English as their mother tongue and are minorities in a region.&lt;ref name="Constitution,1982"&gt;The Constitution Act. (1982). Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Retrieved Nov 5, 2010, from http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/charter/charter.text.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The first accords right of access to instruction in the medium of the mother tongue. The second assures educational facilities for minority languages. The third endows French and English language minorities the right to maintain and develop their own educational facilities. This control can take the form of "exclusive decision-making authority over the expenditure of funds, the appointment and direction of the administration, instructional programs, the recruitment of teachers and personnel, and the making of agreements for education and services".&lt;ref name="Martel,1999"&gt;Martel, Angéline.

Hungary: Central European University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; All of these rights apply to primary and secondary education, sustained on public funds, and depend on the numbers and circumstances.

====Croatia====
{{Main article|Minority languages of Croatia}}
[[File:Croatia minority languages 2011.jpg|thumb|Minority languages in Croatia (official use at local level)]]
[[Croatian language]] is the stated to be the official language of Croatia in Article 3 of the Croatian constitution. The same Article of Constitution stipulates that in some of local units, with the Croatian language and [[Latin script]], in official use may be introduce another language and [[Cyrillic]] or some other script under the conditions prescribed by law. The only example of the use of minority language at the regional level currently is [[Istria County]] where official languages are Croatian and [[Italian language|Italian]]. In eastern Croatia, in [[Joint Council of Municipalities]], at local (municipal) level is introduced [[Serbian language|Serbian]] as co official language. Each municipality, where a certain minority has more than one third of the population, can if it wants to introduce a minority language in official use.

====Finland====
{{See also|Constitution of Finland}}
Finland has one of the most overt linguistic rights frameworks.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt; Discrimination based on language is forbidden under the basic rights for all citizens in [[Finland]]. Section 17 of the Constitution of Finland explicitly details the right to one's language and culture, although these languages are stated as either Finnish or Swedish. This right applies to in courts of law and other authorities, as well as translated official documents. There is also overt obligation of the state to provide for the "cultural and societal needs of the Finnish-speaking and Swedish-speaking populations of the country on an equal basis".&lt;ref name="Finland Constitution"&gt;Parliament of Finland. (1999). The Constitution of Finland.&lt;/ref&gt; Other language communities, the ones specifically mentioned are indigenous groups, are granted the right to maintenance and development of their own language. There is an additional right for the specific group, the Sami, that they may use the Sami language when communicating with authorities. The deaf community is also granted the right to sign language and interpretation or translation. &lt;br&gt;

Regulations regarding the rights of linguistic minorities in Finland, insist on the forming of a district for the first 9 years of comprehensive school education in each language, in municipalities with both Finnish- and Swedish-speaking children, as long as there is a minimum of 13 students from the language community of that mother tongue.&lt;ref name="Skutnabb-Kangas,2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Svenska"&gt;Svenska Finlands Folkting.

====India====
{{See also|Constitution of India}}
The constitution of India was first drafted on January 26, 1950. It is estimated that there are about 1500 languages in India. Article 343–345 declared that the official languages of India for communication with centre will be Hindi and English. There are 22 official languages identified by constitution.  Article 345 states that "the Legislature of a state may by law adopt any one or more of the languages in use in the State or Hindi as the language or languages to be used for all or any of the official purposes of that State: Provided that, until the Legislature of the State otherwise provides by law, the English language shall continue to be used for those official purposes within the State for which it was being used immediately before the commencement of this Constitution".&lt;ref&gt;Groff, C. (2003). Status and acquisition planning and linguistic minorities in India. Online&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====
{{See also|Languages of Ireland}}

Language rights in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] are recognised in the [[Constitution of Ireland]] and in the Official Languages Act.

[[Irish language|Irish]] is the national and first official language according to the Constitution (with English being a second official language). The Constitution permits the public to conduct its business – and every part of its business – with the state solely through Irish.

On 14 July 2003, the [[President of Ireland]] signed the [[Official Languages Act 2003]] into law and the provisions of the Act were gradually brought into force over a three-year period. The Act sets out the duties of public bodies regarding the provision of services in Irish and the rights of the public to avail of those services.

The use of Irish on the country's traffic signs is the most visible illustration of the state's policy regarding the official languages. It is a statutory requirement that placenames on signs be in both Irish and English except in the [[Gaeltacht]], where signs are in Irish only.

====Mexico====
{{See also|Languages of Mexico}}

Language rights were recognized in Mexico in 2003 with the [[Ley General de Derechos Lingüísticos de los Pueblos Indígenas|General Law of Linguistic Rights for the Indigenous Peoples]] which established a framework for the conservation, nurturing and development of indigenous languages. It recognizes the countries Many indigenous languages as coofficial National languages, and obligates government to offer all public services in indigenous languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pellicer, Dora   |author2=Bábara Cifuentes |author3=Carmen Herrera  |year=2006 |chapter=Legislating diversity in twenty-first century Mexico |title=Mexican Indigenous Languages at the Dawn of the Twenty-first Century |editor=Margarita G.

{{see also|Languages of Pakistan}}
Pakistan uses English ([[Pakistani English]]) and [[Urdu]] as official languages. Although Urdu serves as the national language and lingua franca and is understood by most of the population, it is natively spoken by only 8% of the population. English is not natively used as a first language, but, for official purposes, about 49% of the population is able to communicate in some form of English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/sites/teacheng/files/Euromonitor%20Report%20A4.pdf|title=The Benefits of the English Language for Individuals and Societies: Quantitative Indicators from Cameroon, Nigeria, Rwanda, Bangladesh and Pakistan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, major regional languages like [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] (spoken by the majority of the population), [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Saraiki dialect|Saraiki]], [[Hindko]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]], [[Brahui language|Brahui]] and [[Shina language|Shina]] have no official status at the federal level.

The Republic of Poland declares that it shall apply the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] in accordance with the Act on national and ethnic minorities and on regional language, dated 6 January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ListeDeclarations.asp?NT=148&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=23/01/05&amp;CL=ENG&amp;VL=1|title=Search on Treaties|website=Treaty Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====

{{See also|Constitution of Spain}}
Spanish language is the stated to be the official language of Spain in Article 3 of the Spanish constitution, being the learning of this language compulsory by this same article. However, the constitution makes provisions for other languages of Spain to be official in their respective communities. An example would be the use of the Basque language in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community (BAC)]].&lt;ref name="Urla,1988"/&gt; Apart from Spanish, the other co-official languages are Basque, Catalan and Galician.&lt;ref&gt;CIA World Factbook. (2010). Publications: The WORLD FACTBOOK: Europe: Spain. Accessed November 16, 2010, from: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sp.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====

In ratifying the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], Sweden declared five national minority languages: [[Sami languages|Saami]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Meänkieli]], [[Romani language|Romani]], and Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;SFS 1999:1175.

Nationella minoriteter i Sverige. Available from http://www.regeringen.se/rattsdokument/proposition/1999/06/prop.-199899143/&lt;/ref&gt;
Romani and Yiddish are non-territorial minority languages in Sweden and thus their speakers were granted more limited rights than speakers of the other three.&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2004). Planning for multilingualism and minority language rights in Sweden. ''Language Policy, 3''(2), 181–201.&lt;/ref&gt;  After a decade of political debate, Sweden declared Swedish the main language of Sweden with its 2009 Language Act.&lt;ref&gt;SFS 2009:600. Språklag.  Available from https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/spraklag-2009600_sfs-2009-600&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====

{{See also|Constitution of the United States}}
Language rights in the [[United States]] are usually derived from the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], with its Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses, because they forbid racial and ethnic discrimination, allowing language minorities to use this Amendment to claim their language rights.&lt;ref name="Del Valle,2003"&gt;Del Valle, Sandra. (2003). "Language Rights and the Law in the United States: Finding our Voices." Multilingual Matters Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; One example of use of the Due Process Clauses is the ''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' case which held that a 1919 Nebraska law restricting foreign-language education violated the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Two other cases of major importance to linguistic rights were the ''[[Yu Cong Eng v. Trinidad]]'' case, which overturned a language-restrictive legislation in the [[Philippines]], declaring that piece of legislation to be "violative of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Philippine Autonomy Act of Congress",&lt;ref name="Del Valle,2003"/&gt; as well as the ''[[Farrington v. Tokushige]]'' case, which ruled that the governmental regulation of private schools, particularly to restrict the teaching of languages other than English and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], as damaging to the migrant population of [[Hawaii]]. Both of these cases were influenced by the Meyer case, which was a precedent.&lt;ref name="Del Valle,2003"/&gt;

===Disputes over linguistic rights===

====Basque, Spain====
{{See also|Basque language}}
The linguistic situation for Basque is a precarious one. The Basque language is considered to be a low language in [[Spain]], where, until about 1982, the Basque language was not used in administration.&lt;ref name="Urla,1988"&gt;Urla, J. (1988). Ethnic Protest and Social Planning: A Look at Basque Language Revival. Cultural Anthropology , 379–394.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, a law was passed allowing for Basque to be used in administration side by side with Spanish in the Basque autonomous communities.&lt;ref name="Urla,1988"/&gt;

Between 1935 and 1975, the period of Franco's régime, the use of Basque was strictly prohibited, and thus language decline begun to occur as well.&lt;ref name="Gardner,2002"&gt;Gardner, N. (2002). BASQUE IN EDUCATION: IN THE BASQUE AUTONOMOUS COMMUNITY. Department of Culture Basque Government. Euskal Autonomia Erkidegoko Administrazioa Hezkuntza, Unibertsitate eta Ikerketa Saila.&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the death of Franco, many Basque nationalists demanded that the Basque language be recognized.&lt;ref name="Gardner,2002"/&gt; One of these groups was Euskadi Ta Askatasun ([[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]). ETA had initially begun as a nonviolent group to promote Basque language and culture.&lt;ref name="Gardner,2002"/&gt; However, when its demands were not met, it turned violent and evolved into violent separatist groups. Today, ETA's demands for a separate state stem partially from the problem of perceived linguistic discrimination.&lt;ref name="Gardner,2002"/&gt; However, ETA called a permanent cease-fire in October 2011.

====Faroe Islands====
{{See also|Faroese language conflict}}
The [[Faroese language]] conflict, which occurred roughly between 1908 and 1938, has been described as political and cultural in nature. The two languages competing to become the official language of the Faroe Islands were Faroese and Danish. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the language of the government, education and Church was Danish, whereas Faroese was the language of the people. The movement towards Faroese language rights and preservation was begun in the 1880s by a group of students. This spread from 1920 onwards to a movement towards using Faroese in the religious and government sector. Faroese and Danish are now both official languages in the Faroe Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Poulsen, J. H. (1999). On Faroese Language Planning. In G. Spiess, Modernisierung des Wortschatzes europäischer Regional- und Minderheitensprachen (pp. 147–151). Gunter Narr Verlag Tubingen.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nepal====
{{See also| Nepal Bhasa movement}}

The [[Newar]]s of [[Nepal]] have been struggling to save their [[Nepal Bhasa]] language, culture and identity since the 1920s. Nepal Bhasa was suppressed during the [[Rana dynasty|Rana]] (1846–1951) and [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] (1960–1990) regimes leading to language decline. The Ranas forbade writing in [[Nepal Bhasa]] and authors were jailed or exiled. Beginning in 1965, the Panchayat system eased out regional languages from the radio and educational institutions, and protestors were put in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Bal Gopal|title=The Newars: The Indigenous Population of the Kathmandu Valley in the Modern State of Nepal |url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_26_01_04.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the reinstatement of democracy in 1990, restrictions on publishing were relaxed; but attempts to gain usage in local state entities side by side with [[Nepali language|Nepali]] failed. On 1 June 1999, the Supreme Court forbade [[Kathmandu]] Metropolitan City from giving official recognition to Nepal Bhasa, and [[Rajbiraj]] Municipality and [[Dhanusa District|Dhanusa]] District Development Committee from recognizing [[Maithili language|Maithili]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tumbahang | first = Govinda Bahadur | url = http://tujournal.edu.np/index.php/TUJ/article/view/18/16| title = Process of Democratization and Linguistic (Human) Rights in Nepal| work =Tribhuvan University Journal | pages =18–19 | date= September 2009| accessdate = 20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007 recognizes all the languages spoken as mother tongues in Nepal as the national languages of Nepal. It says that Nepali in [[Devanagari]] script shall be the language of official business, however, the use of mother tongues in local bodies or offices shall not be considered a barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sambidhan.org/Constitution%202063%20English-07/Part%201.pdf |title=The Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007|publisher=Constitution Forum |accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of national languages in local government bodies has not happened in practice, and discouragement in their use and discrimination in allocation of resources persist. Some analysts have stated that one of the chief causes of the Maoist insurgency, or the [[Nepalese Civil War]] (1996–2006), was the denial of language rights and marginalization of ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhimalaya.com/projectteam/turin/downloads/MRD.pdf |title= Mountain Research and Development |publisher= United Nations University and International Mountain Society |page=7 |accessdate=20 September 2013|date= February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sri Lanka====
{{See also|Sinhala Only Act}}

The start of the conflict regarding languages in [[Sri Lanka]] goes as far back as the rule of the British. During the colonial period, English had a special and powerful position in Sri Lanka. The British ruled in Sri Lanka from the late eighteenth century to 1948.  English was the official language of administration then. Just before the departure of the British, a "swabhasha" (your own language) movement was launched in a bid to phase out English slowly, replacing it with [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. However, shortly after the departure of the British the campaign, for various political reasons, evolved from advocating Sinhala and Tamil replacing English to just Sinhala replacing English.

In 1956, the first election after independence, the opposition won and the official language was declared to be Sinhala. The Tamil people were unhappy, feeling that they were greatly disadvantaged. Because Sinhala was now the official language, it made it easier for the people whose mother tongue was Sinhala to enter into government sector and also provided them with an unfair advantage in the education system. Tamils who also did not understand Sinhala felt greatly inconvenienced as they had to depend on others to translate official documents for them.

Both the Tamil and Sinhala-speaking people felt that language was crucial to their identity. The Sinhala people associated the language with their rich heritage. They were also afraid that, given that there were only 9 million speakers of the language at that time, if Sinhala was not the only official language it would eventually be slowly lost.&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"/&gt; The Tamil people felt that the Sinhala-only policy would assert the dominance of the Sinhalese people and as such they might lose their language, culture and identity.&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"/&gt;

Despite the unhappiness of the Tamil people, no big political movement was undertaken till the early 1970s. Eventually in May 1976, there was a public demand for a Tamil state. During the 1956 election the Federal party had replaced the Tamil congress. The party was bent on "the attainment of freedom for the Tamil-speaking people of Ceylon by the establishment of an autonomous Tamil state on the linguistic basis within the framework of a Federal Union of Ceylon".&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"/&gt; However it did not have much success. Thus in 1972, the Federal Party, Tamil Congress and other organizations banded together into a new party called the "Tamil United Front".

One of the catalysts for Tamil separation arose in 1972 when the Sinhala government made amendments to the constitution. The Sinhala government decided to promote Buddhism as the official religion, claiming that "it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster Buddhism".&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"/&gt; Given that the majority of the Tamils were Hindus, this created unease. There was then a fear among the Tamils that people belonging to the "untouchable castes" would be encouraged to convert to Buddhism and then "brainwashed" to learn Sinhala as well.&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"/&gt;

Another spur was also the impatience of Tamil youth in Sri Lanka. Veteran politicians noted that current youths were more ready to engage in violence, and some of them even had ties to certain rebel groups in South India. Also in 1974, there was conference of Tamil studies organized in [[Jaffna]]. The conference turned violent. This resulted in the deaths of seven people. Consequently, about 40 – 50 Tamil youths in between the years of 1972 and 1975 were detained without being properly charged, further increasing tension.

A third stimulus was the changes in the criteria for University examinations in the early 1970s. The government decided that they wanted to standardize the university admission criteria, based on the language the entrance exams were taken in. It was noted that students who took the exams in Tamil scored better than the students who took it in Sinhala. Thus the government decided that Tamil students had to achieve a higher score than the students who took the exam in Sinhala to enter the universities. As a result, the number of Tamil students entering universities fell.

After the July 1977 election, relations between the Sinhalese and the Ceylon Tamil people became worse. There was flash violence in parts of the country. It is estimated about 100 people were killed and thousands of people fled from their homes. Among all these tensions, the call for a separate state among Tamil people grew louder.&lt;ref name="Kearney,1978"&gt;Kearney, R. (1978). Language and the Rise of Tamil Separatism in Sri Lanka. Asian Survey, 18(5), 521–534.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) [[World Heritage Site]]s are places of importance to [[cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage]] as described in the UNESCO [[World Heritage Convention]], established in 2025&lt;ref name=convention&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ |title=The World Heritage Convention |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethiopia]] ratified the convention as one of the first countries on July 6, 1977, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list.&lt;ref name=ethiopia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/et/ |title=Ethiopia – Properties inscribed on the World Heritage List |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sites in Ethiopia were first inscribed on the list at the 2nd Session of the [[World Heritage Committee]], held in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1978. At that session, two sites were added: the [[Lalibela|Rock-Hewn Churches, Lalibela]] and [[Simien National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repcom78.htm|title= Report of the Rapporteur|publisher=UNESCO |date=October 9, 1978 |accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2014, Ethiopia has nine total sites inscribed on the list. Of these, one site, Simien National Park, is of natural type, and the others are cultural sites.&lt;ref name=ethiopia/&gt;

The [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]]s are places of importance to [[cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage]] as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972.&lt;ref name="convention"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/ |title=The World Heritage Convention |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portugal]] adopted the convention on 30 September 1980, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list.&lt;ref name="portugal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/pt/ |title=Portugal – Properties inscribed on the World Heritage List |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=9 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721102456/http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/pt/ |archivedate=21 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sites in Portugal were first inscribed on the list at the 7th Session of the [[World Heritage Committee]], held in [[Florence]], [[Italy]],  in 1983. Four sites were added: the "[[Angra do Heroísmo|Central Zone of the Town of Angra do Heroísmo]] in the [[Azores]]", the "[[Monastery of Batalha]]", the "[[Convent of Christ (Tomar)|Convent of Christ]] in [[Tomar]]", and the joint inscription of the "[[Jerónimos Monastery|Monastery of the Hieronymites]] and the [[Tower of Belém]] in [[Lisbon]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the rapporteur|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/1983/sc-83-conf009-8e.pdf|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=24 June 2013|format=PDF|date=January 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2018, Portugal has 15 sites inscribed on the list, 14 of which are cultural and one is natural, according to the [[World Heritage Site#Selection criteria|selection criteria]]. Three sites are located in the Azores and [[Madeira]] archipelagos, while one is shared with [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="portugal"/&gt; The most recent inscription is the [[University of Coimbra|University of Coimbra – Alta and Sofia]] site in [[Coimbra]], during the 37th Session in [[Phnom Penh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qatar and Fiji get their first World Heritage sites as World Heritage Committee makes six additions to UNESCO List|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/qatar_and_fiji_get_their_first_world_heritage_sites_as_world_heritage_committee_makes_six_additions_to_unesco_list/|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=22 June 2013|date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manuscript culture''' uses [[manuscript]]s to store and disseminate information; in the West, it generally preceded the age of [[printing]]. In early manuscript culture, monks copied manuscripts by hand. They copied not just religious works, but a variety of texts including some on astronomy, [[herbals]], and [[bestiaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voigts|first=Linda|title=Anglo-Saxon Plant Remedies and the Anglo Saxons|journal=Isis|date=June 1, 1979|volume=70|issue=2|page=251|doi=10.1086/352199}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval manuscript culture deals with the transition of the manuscript from the monasteries to the market in the cities, and the rise of universities. Manuscript culture in the cities created jobs built around the making and trade of manuscripts, and typically was regulated by universities. Late manuscript culture was characterized by a desire for uniformity, well-ordered and convenient access to the text contained in the manuscript, and ease of reading aloud. This culture grew out of the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] (1215) and the rise of the [[Devotio Moderna]]. It included a change in materials (switching from vellum to paper), and was subject to remediation by the printed book, while also influencing it.

== Medieval manuscript culture ==

=== Beginnings ===
[[File:مخطوطات عربية قديمة.jpg|thumb|Arabic Manuscripts from the 18th century]]
Manuscript culture seems to have really begun around the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voigts|first=Linda|title=Anglo-Saxon Plant Remedies and the Anglo-Saxons|journal=Isis|date=June 1, 1979|volume=70|issue=2|pages=250–268|doi=10.1086/352199}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to say however, that manuscripts and the recording of information was not important prior to the 10th century, but that during the 10th century, historians see an influx and heavier weight placed on these manuscripts. This was a time when medical practitioners were advancing what they knew about the human body and the way that certain substances interacted with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1980|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-48233-2|pages=432–433}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These medical practitioners recorded this information and passed it on through the means of literate people. Catholic [[monasteries]] and [[cathedrals]] during the Middle Ages were centers of learning (see [[cathedral schools]]), so it would only make sense for these texts to end up in the hands of the monks.

These monks would meticulously record the information presented in the texts, but not mindlessly. In the case of herbals, for instance, there is evidence that the monks improved upon some texts, retracted textual errors, and made the text particularly relevant to the area in which they lived. Some monasteries even went so far as to grow some of the plants included in the texts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Voigts|first=Linda|title=Anglo-Saxon Plant Remedies and Anglo Saxons|journal=Isis|date=June 1, 1979|volume=70|issue=2|pages=250–252|doi=10.1086/352199}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was due in part to their intimate understanding of their local herbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=The Beginnings of Western Science|first=Lindberg|title=David|date=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important to note because it demonstrated the practical uses of these text in the lives of the monks. They had little room, or patience for that matter, to disseminate the imaginary plants and fanciful texts that are so commonly imagined in the minds of those who think of this era. The writers truly restricted themselves to only include practical information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1978|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=430–431}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a time when plants and botany was linked very closely with medicine and [[herbal remedies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=The Beginnings of Western Science|date=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of bestiaries, similarly to herbals, the monks generally copied and cited previous texts to pass them on. Unlike the herbals, the monks could not grow an animal in their garden, so largely the information taken from the bestiaries was taken at face value. The consequence of this is that the writers were free to elaborate and embellish upon texts. This was a definite and deliberate attempt to give the animal in question a certain moral or allegorical meaning beyond the physical appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1978|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=432–433}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bestiary texts can be very like traditional mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=The Beginnings of Western Science|date=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=354–355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trade ===
In the 13th century, [[Paris]] was the first city to have a large commercial trade of manuscripts, with manuscript-book producers being commissioned to make specific books for specific people. Paris had a large enough population of wealthy literate persons to support the livelihood of people producing manuscripts. This medieval era marks the shift in manuscript production from monks in monasteries to booksellers and scribes making a living from their work in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Nicolas, and British Library. ''A Potencie of Life : Books in Society : The Clark Lectures 1986–1987, British Library Studies in the History of the Book.'' London: British Library, 1993. p. 45-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flourished initial "L" from a medieval manuscript.jpeg|thumb|left|Flourished initial L&lt;ref&gt;http://wally.rit.edu/cary/cc_db/manuscripts/43a.jpeg&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Individuals did scribal work, but collaboration has been suggested.  Commercial [[workshops]] or ateliers operated out of Paris during this time, often collaborating on jobs.  Research from François Avril, Joan Diamond and others has confirmed that two or more [[artists]] alternated, or otherwise shared, in the illumination of a single manuscript; however, the detailed logistics of this work remain unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, 1993 p.46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most medieval [[scribes]] gathered together as they copied, but some separated books into sections to copy them in parts.  Previously in the monasteries, work was broken up between scribes and [[Limner|illuminators]]; examples exist where the scribe would leave space for and write out a small cursive letter at the beginning of a new paragraph, which was then painted in at a later time by the illuminator.&lt;ref&gt;de Hamel, Christopher. ''The British Library Guide to Manuscript Illumination: History and Techniques.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press. 1988. p. 41-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pecia system ===

The pecia system was developed in [[Italy|Italian]] university cities by the beginning of the thirteenth century and became a regulated procedure at the [[University of Paris]] in the second half of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, Richard H., and Mary A. Rouse. ''Manuscripts and Their Makers : Commercial Book Producers in Medieval Paris'', 1200–1500. 2 vols, Illiterati Et Uxorati. Turnhout, Belgium: Harvey Miller, 2000. p.85.&lt;/ref&gt; The pecia system broke up the book into sections called peciae.  Individuals — such as students — would rent them, section by section, to copy.  The peciae were generally four folios long which allowed for a fast turn-over rate for each pecia for students to exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Ullman, B. L., "La Pecia dans les manuscrits universitaires du XIII  e et du XIV  e siecle." Rev. of La Pecia, by Jean Destrez. ''Classical Philology'', Vol. 33, No. 2. Apr. 1938: pp. 238-240.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this system, a larger number of copiers, working simultaneously, could produce a copy in a significantly shorter amount of time than a single person working alone.

[[File:c7463-01a.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of pecia mark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/ILLUMIN.ASP?Size=mid&amp;IllID=13853|title=Image of an item from the British Library Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts|first=C|last=Wight|date=|website=www.bl.uk|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The original collection of peciae for a book from which all future copies will be based is called the exemplar.  The process of making an exemplar was supposed to be an orderly procedure: Masters of the university who compiled a new work were to edit, correct, and submit this authentic text to a stationer; he in turn copied from it an exemplar in peciae, corrected these against the [[author| author’s]] text with utmost care, and finally submitted them to the inspection of the university’s delegates for approval and for the setting of a rental price. Only then were peciae available for rental and copy.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, Mary A., and Richard H. Rouse. ''Authentic Witnesses : Approaches to Medieval Texts and Manuscripts'', Publications in Medieval Studies ; 17 Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1991. p.303.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reality, it came down to the [[stationer]] — part of whose job was renting out peciae — finding and offering for rental the works which he thought would be demanded. This pressure on the stationers prompted them to acquire exemplars in as good a state and in as short a time as possible. The emphasis was on speed of acquisition instead of the quality of the product. If a certain work seemed likely to become a “best seller,” a stationer would make a copy of the best text immediately available, and would have his exemplar-peciae corrected as well as time permitted. At times, the stationer sought the text; at other times, it was the author who offered his newly completed work to the stationer, but it was never the university as a formal body which made requests or developed what was to be offered.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.304-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Booksellers in Paris ===
[[Philip IV of France|King Philip the Fair of France]], 1285–1314, instituted a .4% commercial [[tax]] on all goods.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, 1993 p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1307 the King exempted all the ''librarii universitatis'' from paying the commercial tax, the taille. This exemption privileged the French universities over the booksellers because if they did not swear the oath they would not be exempt from the tax.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.272.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scriptorium - 15th Century - Project Gutenberg eText 16531.jpg|thumb|left| Paul Pierce within an illustration of a Mediæval Scriptorium. From a manuscript of a Book of Prayers. 15th Century. British Museum, Slo. 2468.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Benham]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16531 ''Old St. Paul's Cathedral'' - Project Gutenberg]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''Librarius'' is a general term while ''stationarius'' refers to one specific kind of librarius. ''Librarius'' can mean anything from scribe to bookseller to [[librarian]]. ''Stationarius'' or stationer refers to those types of ''librarius'' who rented out peciae. Both types, however, were involved in the secondhand trade, produced new books, and were regulated by the university.  The sole distinction between them was the stationer's added service of renting out pecia.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.261-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Restrictions ====

The oaths that the ''librarii'' or booksellers had to swear to the [[university|universities]] to obey their regulations and requirements for the tax exemption were extremely restrictive in regard to the resale of secondhand books. They were supposed to act more like intermediaries between the seller and the buyer while their profit was limited to essentially four pence per pound. They were further required to display the secondhand books prominently in their shops, give a professional assessment of the likely price of the books submitted to them, and put would-be buyers in direct contact with the seller.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.270.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bookseller had to swear not to underpay when buying and not to overcharge when selling. The stationers rented out copies of useful texts, one [[Paper quire|quire]] at a time, so students and masters could make their own copies. Both fees were regulated by the university.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, 1993 p.52-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Both kinds of booksellers had to guarantee their compliance to their oath by posting a bond of 100 [[pence]].&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 2000 p.77.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:irwin1.jpg|thumb|right|A monk inspecting a sheet of parchment
which he is buying from a parchment-maker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hortulus.net/may06lf/irwin.html|title=Hortulus: The Online Graduate Journal of Medieval Studies|author=|date=|website=hortulus.net|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
It was not just the booksellers which the universities regulated. Additionally, university regulations forbade parchmenters from hiding the good [[parchment]] from university members wanting to buy. There were plenty of other demands for parchment outside the university such as: the record-keeping for the royal government, every similar entity of a commercial or mercantile [[guild]], every religious house that issued a [[charter]] or kept a rent roll, every public letter-writer, everyone from major international trader to local shop-keeper who kept accounts. They all demanded parchment in greater numbers and were willing to pay higher than the regulated price which the university members paid. And so, the universities feeling such pressures often chose to regulate parchment as well.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 2000 p.80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Benefits ====

While there were many restrictions on the bookseller, the job did have its benefits. The bookseller was free to produce and sell books, illuminate, or write for anyone they pleased like the Court, cathedral, or the wealthy [[laymen]] of the [[Capital (political)|capital]] and [[provinces]] so long as they met their obligations to the university to which they had sworn oaths. In fact, most of their trade fell outside of the university regulation. There is an important distinction between the regulation of how books were traded within the university and how the booksellers were able to charge whatever the open market would bear. To the non-student or masters, there were no such restrictions on the booksellers.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p.269.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1300–1500, the position of libraire was a closed position only open upon the resignation or death of a previous one. Aside from cheap books, it was only the libraire who was allowed to sell books in Paris. The university essentially guaranteed a monopoly on the sale of books for booksellers.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 2000 p.78.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Late Manuscript Culture ==

===Characteristics===
[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|An author portrait of [[Jean Miélot]] writing his compilation of the ''Miracles of Our Lady'', one of his many popular works.]]
The period of "Late Manuscript Culture" dates from roughly the mid-fourteenth century to the fifteenth century, preceding and existing alongside the printing press.  While embodying all of the ideals and adhering to the regulations observable in the [[Devotio Moderna]], there are many clear characteristics of Late Manuscript Culture.  For instance, careful attention was paid to the punctuation and layout of texts, with readability and specifically reading aloud taking preeminence. Meaning had to be clear in every sentence, with as little room left to interpretation as possible (compared to the lack of spaces in text and any markings for the purpose of aiding in enunciation), due to preachings' rise in popularity after the [[Fourth Lateran Council]].  Correct [[orthography]] was attempted whenever the necessary exemplars made it possible to emend earlier texts, especially Bibles, and this correction made many texts uniform.  In this period of Manuscript Culture, the emendatiora, manuscripts which combined surviving texts of the oldest available exemplars with the manuscripts that had been currently acceptable and prominent, were created.&lt;ref&gt;
Rouse, Mary A., and Richard H. Rouse. Authentic Witnesses : Approaches to Medieval Texts and Manuscripts, Publications in Medieval Studies ; 17, p. 447-457.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aids to find one's way about the text are prominent features in these manuscripts.  While none were invented solely in fifteenth century, they were used with increasing frequency and became more complex. These include:

* tables of contents
* lists of chapters, either at the beginning of each book or gathered at the beginning of the whole work (if it is a collection of works)
* running headlines
* extensively detailed [[Colophon (publishing)|colophons]]
* page numbers in [[Arabic numerals]].
* the appearance of subject indexes&lt;ref&gt;Hellinga, Lotte.  The Codex in the Fifteenth Century. Manuscript and Print. Barker, Nicolas, ed. and British Library. A Potencie of Life : Books in Society : The Clark Lectures 1986–1987, British Library Studies in the History of the Book. London: British Library, 1993. p. 63-84. Rouse, 1991. p. 452-459.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other changes included the enlargement of the [[rubric]] from one to two lines in the university manuscript to eight or ten, and the distinction of it by separate letter-form.  The rubric also changed in regard to the categories of information included in it. An earlier rubric might have contained a title of the particular section or article, and a description of the ending of the preceding one.  A fifteenth century rubric would add information about the translator or translators, and the original writer if they were not particularly well known. A brief description of their content, or even detailed information considering the date or conditions of the works creation is also occasionally seen, though not as frequently. These changes exemplify the desire for uniformity, ease of access, and strict regulation of a given work and its subsequent correction.  These are many of the same goals attributed to the uniformity exemplified by the printing press.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p. 452-457&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Production of manuscripts at the beginning of the fifteenth century ===

The emergence of new standards in manuscript production, beginning in the [[Low Countries]] at the end of the fourteenth century, clearly marked the beginning of a new epoch in manuscript culture. Uniformity would result from the desire for clarity, both in terms of bibliographic accuracy and the reproduction and correction of the text itself.  It necessitated greater organization, specifically within the monastic [[scriptoria]].  These had lost pre-eminence in medieval manuscript culture, characterized by the university, but had begun to undergo a rebirth in the fourteenth century.  Historians have characterized this period as chaotic, with very poor quality paper manuscripts being held as a standard.  However, the varying quality of materials did not affect the quality of the text contained on it, as the transition was made from parchment to rag paper. For instance, there was the formation of a new script, called hybrida, that sought to combine the traditional cursiva script with the script used in printed books.  There was little loss of legibility, due to the use of sharp angles instead of loops.  Additionally, in the first half of the fifteenth century, the practice of using a hierarchy of scripts to demarcate different sections of a text was re-instituted.  Rubrics and colophons were clearly set off from the remainder of a text, employing their own unique script.  All of these changes resulted from a desire for improved accuracy, and led to the creation of complex codification rules.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 450-452&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uniformity amidst variety ===

Many manuscripts were produced that had differences in terms of size, layout, script, and illumination.  They were based on the same text while being created by many different scribes.  Yet, they were meticulously corrected, to the point that very few differences in terms of the text itself can be observed among them.  This implied not only the presence of a direct authority that maintained some sort of direction over the scribes, but also a newfound pursuit of scholarly accuracy that had not been present with the university book sellers. It was emphasized by the new religious orders that had been created in the fourteenth century.  Correction and emendation would be held in the same esteem as copying itself.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 427-440&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Codification rules and the Opus Pacis ===

Written in 1428 by the German [[Carthusian]], Oswald de Corda, prior of the Grand Chartreuse, the Opus Pacis consisted of two parts.  One dealt primarily with orthography and accent, where Oswald stated that his motive in creating these codification rules was to dispel the anxiety of his fellow [[Carthusians]].  Many members of the order were worried about the omission of single letters, not just phrases, words or syllables within copies of a given text (demonstrating the new concern for uniformity taken to an extreme).  It is clear that his audience was composed of [[scribes]], specifically those meticulous to “the verge of neurosis”.  He seeks to reinforce the importance of older statutes regarding manuscript production, such as the Carthusian statutes, and the way in which he seeks to correct them.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, 450-457&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Statuta Nova of 1368 ====

Oswald specifically wanted to reform the Statuta Nova of 1368. It stated no one could emend copies of the Old and New Testament, unless they were doing so against exemplars that had been prescribed by their order.  Anyone who corrected texts in a manner inconsistent with those exemplars was publicly acknowledged to have corrupted the text, and subsequently punished.  Oswald answered this with his Work of Peace, and stated that correctors should not engage in pointless labor by over-correcting.  In it, he described correction not as a command, but an indulgence. It was practiced for the improvement and glorification of a text, and though it followed a set of rules, they were not so strict as to stifle emendation.  This was a transition from older works with large amounts of lists and regulations that mandated every action a scribe could take in correction, and had been widely ignored in medieval print culture.  Oswald rejected a system in which one must simply pick a single exemplar and correct according to it, or reproduce portions of texts which the scribe knew to be in error due to a proper exemplar not being attainable. Before Oswald, many believed these were the only available options under the older, strict rules.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 440-452&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New rules of corrections ====

Oswald specifically made sure to outline the proper way of correcting various readings of the same text, as observed in varying exemplars.  He stated that scribes shouldn't instantly correct according to one or the other, but deliberate, and use proper judgment.  Oswald also said that in the case of bibles, scribes should not immediately modernize archaic spellings, because this had produced further variation within texts. Oswald also detailed a uniform set of abbreviations. However, he stated that scribes should recognize national differences, particularly in light of the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]].  Scribes were right to correct texts with different dialects of [[Latin]], especially if they were using archaic forms of Latin verbs, however.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hist.msu.ru/Departments/Medieval/Cappelli/ Rouse 1991, p. 440-452&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Valde Bonum ====

In his prologue to the Opus Pacis, Oswald contrasts his work with the Valde Bonum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmml.org/research06/catalogue/detail.asp?MSID=76416 A 14th/15th century, German Valde Bonum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213323/http://www.hmml.org/research06/catalogue/detail.asp?MSID=76416 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an earlier handbook compiled during the Great Schism.  It had attempted to set forth universal spellings for the [[Bible]], and stated that the corrector need not emend to conform to an exemplar from a given region based on its perceived superiority, but could rather take local regional practice as a standard.  It acknowledged that centuries of use, and transmission from nation to nation, had an effect on various spellings.  He incorporated many of these elements into his Opus Pacis, which was copied and put to practical use, and had spread from [[Germany]] as far north as [[Ireland]].  By the 1480s, it had become a standard, specifically for the Devotio Moderna and the Reformed [[Benedictines]]. Opus Pacis became a generic term for any work of its kind.  The last surviving copy was written in 1514, indicating that manuscript correction remained an important subject sixty years into the printed era.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 440-448&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manuscript as a vehicle for preaching ===

It was in Late Manuscript Culture that the written page took on a renewed meaning to religious communities.  Scriptorias of Benedictine, Cisterican and Augustinaian houses had resumed after being suppressed by the production of university and mendicant books.  Particularly, these scriptoria exemplified the idea that one shall live by the fruit of one's labors.  Writing sacred books was the most fitting, suitable and pious task that one could undertake to do so.  Also, copying these books was equivalent to preaching with ones hands.  Sermons were only of moderate importance in the 13th century. By the 15th century, after the emphasis placed on preaching in the Fourth Lateran Council, they were of the utmost importance.  The formation and expansion of preaching orders led to the proliferation of pastoral theology in schools, and preaching was now an indispensable part of the sacraments.  Uniform manuscripts with many tools made for ease of reference, reading, and enunciation became necessary.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 452-456&lt;/ref&gt;

The Devotio Moderna and the reformed Benedictines relied on reading devotional texts for instruction, and the written word was raised to a high level of importance not afforded by earlier religious movements.   The writing was just as important as the word.  In fact, monasteries bought many printed books, becoming the main market for the early printing press, precisely because of this devotion to preaching.  Without the Devotio Moderna and orders that followed their example, the need for texts and printers would not have been present. Printing had exploded in [[Germany]] and the Low Countries, the home of the Devotio Moderna and Reformed Benedictines, as opposed to [[England]] and [[France]]. They were also the home to the beginnings of Late Manuscript Culture, because of the common desire for uniformity. Trimethius protested the invasion of the [[library]] by the printed book because of the missing aspect of devotion that had been present in preaching with ones' hands.  With the preaching possible as a scribe, manuscripts had a function that was lacking in a printed book, though both possessed a greater degree of uniformity than earlier manuscripts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Manuscripts and the arrival of print ===

By roughly 1470, the transition from [[Penmanship|handwritten]] books to printed ones had begun.  The book trade, in particular, underwent drastic changes.  By this point German printing presses had reached the northernmost regions of [[Europe]], specifically Paris.  By 1500, print had stopped imitating manuscripts and manuscripts were imitating print.  In the reign of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1515–1547) for instance, the king's handwritten manuscripts were based on Roman type.  While quality rag paper had appeared before the arrival of the printing press, it was at this time that parchmenters lost most of their business.  Paper was not only acceptable, it was preferable, and printers and scribes had both ceased to use parchment altogether.  Many libraries decried these changes, because of the loss in individuality and subtlety that resulted.&lt;ref&gt;Lotte, p. 63–81 Rouse, Richard H., and Mary A. Rouse. ''Manuscripts and Their Makers : Commercial Book Producers in Medieval Paris, 1200–1500''. 2 vols, Illiterati Et Uxorati. Turnhout, Belgium: Harvey Miller, 2000. p. 328-329&lt;/ref&gt; Many printed books and manuscripts were even created with the same paper.  The same watermarks are often observable on them, that signified the particular paper dealer who created it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ksbm.oeaw.ac.at/_scripts/php/wzma.php wzma.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611161722/http://www2.ksbm.oeaw.ac.at/_scripts/php/wzma.php |date=11 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuscripts were still written and illuminated well into the sixteenth century, some dating to just before 1600.  Many illuminators continued to work on various manuscripts, specifically the [[Book of Hours]].  The Book of Hours had been the most commonly produced manuscript from the 1450s onward, and was among the last manuscripts created.  By the sixteenth century, however, manuscripts were mostly illuminated by artists retained by nobles or royals.  Their work was required (and manuscripts were created) only for unusual occasions, such as noble or royal births, weddings, or other extraordinary occurrences.  The number of copyists had greatly declined, as these types of manuscripts were not intended for mass, or even student, consumption.&lt;ref&gt;''Hellinga, Lotte. p. 63-79'' Rouse 2000, p. 329-331&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional organization of book production fell apart; they were made up of libraries doling out quires to scribes and illuminators, who lived in proximity.  The new, specialized system based on patronage didn't support them.  Libraries, and not scribes, turned into printers, and served as a link between late manuscript culture and print culture.  They had possessed reserves of manuscripts, and slowly supplemented them with printed books, until printed books dominated their collections. However, the cost and risks involved in making books greatly increased with the transition to print. Still, Paris and more northern areas of Europe (especially France) had been the foremost center of manuscript production, and remained a force in the printed book market, falling only behind Venice.&lt;ref&gt;Hellinga, Lotte. p. 63-72 Rouse 2000, p. 329–332&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manuscript descent and exemplars ====

There were accounts{{By whom|date=February 2011}} of scribes working in a similar manner in comparison to their rival printers, though the process was still subtly different.  The pages on sheets of vellum were folded together to form a quire before the invention of printing or paper, and printed books also bound multiple quires to form a codex. They were simply made of paper.  Manuscripts were also used as exemplars for printed books. Lines were counted off based on the exemplar and marked in advance, while the typesetting reflected the layout of the manuscript's text.  Within a few generations, however, printed books were used as new exemplars. This process created various “family trees”, as many printed sources would be double checked against earlier manuscripts if the quality was deemed too low.  This necessitated the creation of stemma, or lines of descent among books. This made manuscripts gain a new significance, as sources to find earlier authority or a better authority, in comparison to the published version of a text.  [[Erasmus]], for instance, attained authoritative manuscripts from the medieval period due to his dissatisfaction with printed Bibles.

=== Christine de Pizan and humanist illumination ===

The Epistre Othea or Letter of Othea to Hector,  composed in 1400, symbolized the murky transition from manuscript culture to the Renaissance and humanistic print culture.  It was a retelling of the classical story of Othea through an illuminated manuscript, though it conveyed many humanistic Renaissance ideas.  Created by [[Christine de Pizan]], its patron was Louis of Orleans, heir to the French throne.  It contained over 100 images, and each chapter opened with the image of a mythological figure or event.  It also contained short narrative verses, and text addressed to Hector.  Each prose passage contained a labeled gloss, and attempted to interpret a humanistic lesson from the myth.  Every gloss closed with a quote from an ancient philosopher.  Additionally, other short prose passages called allegories concluded a section. They conveyed lessons applicable to the soul, and a Latin Bible quotation.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond, Marilynn and Pamela Sheingorn. Myth, montage, &amp; visuality in late medieval manuscript culture : Christine de Pizan’s Epistre Othea. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2003. p. 1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Christine de Pizan combined contemporary images through illumination with new humanistic values typically associated with print.  Her work was based on [[Ovid]]'s, and many Ovidian myths were traditionally illuminated, in the medieval period.  She also incorporated astrology, Latin texts, and a wide variety of classical mythology in fleshing out Ovid's account, maintaining her humanist motivations.  This contradiction also led to the use of illuminatio, or the practice of using light as color.  Her Othea is a [[bricolage]], restructuring tradition while not trying to create a new master work.  It was done in the style of an ordinatio, or layout that emphasized the meaning of the organization of images.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond and Sheingorn, p.1-192&lt;/ref&gt;

The Othea reflected a late manuscript culture that was defined by violence, action, and gender challenges within literature. Anger was depicted in relation to gender, and marked “a departure from the Aristotelian tradition”.   Women were no longer driven into mindless frenzies, but possessed anger that developed from fully considered character interactions.  The Epistre Othea remained Christine's most popular work, despite the fact that multiple versions existed.  Because of the fluid nature of manuscript reproduction, specifically in the case of illumination (as opposed to the text), the visual experience was not uniform. Each exemplar incorporated diverse cultural elements, with many having entirely different philosophical and theological implications.  Only later reproductions that used woodcuts to reproduce the images created a truly authorial version of the manuscript.  It also owed its  very existence to the printing press in the first instance, because bibles were now relegated to the press, leaving nonreligious texts available for detailed illumination.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond and Sheingorn, p. 192-241&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constructing an Auctor with Chaucer ===

====William Caxton====
While using medieval manuscripts as exemplars, many printers attempted to implant humanist values into the text. They attempted to create a uniform work, displaying many similarities in terms of motivation with the Devotio Moderna.  Early editors and publishers needed definitive works to define a culture.  [[William Caxton]] (1415~1424-1492), an editor, was instrumental in shaping English culture and language, and did so through his authoritative Works of [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmml.org/research06/catalogue/detail.asp?MSID=111051 A 14th/15th century, Caxton era Works of Chaucer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213202/http://www.hmml.org/research06/catalogue/detail.asp?MSID=111051 |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Caxton was a transitional figure, who sought to close the gap between manuscript culture and a more humanistic print culture through Chaucer's work.  Specifically, Caxton attempted to make Chaucer appear similar to classical writers and continental poets.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Lauryn S.. Words made flesh: reading medieval manuscript culture. New York, NY: Routledge, 2004. p. 121-145&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chaucer as humanist ====

Caxton attempted to make Chaucer into an English [[Petrarch]] or [[Virgil]], and realized that new humanistic sixteenth century versions of his work had to recognize fourteenth century versions.  His Chaucer transcended medieval ideals, and became timeless, conforming to humanistic ideals.  This required construction of a literary genealogy referred to older medieval exemplars.  Through his editing, Chaucer was framed as an early promoter of the Renaissance, who decried Gothic and medieval culture, and who rescued the English language.

{{Rquote|left|he by hys labour enbelysshyd/ornated and made faire our englisshe/in thys Royame was had rude speche &amp; Incongrue/as yet it appiereth by olde bookes/whych at thys day ought not to haue place ne be compared emong ne to hys beauteuous volumes/and aournate writynges|Mayer, p. 123 |William Caxton}}

&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, p. 121-148&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Caxton and the flaws of "Olde Bookes" ====

Caxton wanted to discard “old bookes” that were characteristic of medieval culture.  To do this, he modernized older terms and introduced Latinate spellings.  He removed the influence of manuscript culture, that allowed the reader to have some textual authority.  Caxton believed that printed books could set a defined authorship, in which the reader would not feel it appropriate to change the text or add glosses.  He believed that cheap versions of this authorial Chaucer would allow a diverse group of readers to develop common economic and political ideals, unifying the culture of England.  He was the exemplum for the English standard.  His version of Chaucer was well liked by [[Henry VII of England]], who decided to spread it in order to help provide England with a common cultural background.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, p. 132-148&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Changing perceptions of the book ====

To most people in the late age of manuscript culture,  books were codices first, vehicles for text, regardless of whether they were printed or handwritten.  The cost of obtaining them determined the standard, and printed books gradually gained precedence.  William Caxton stated that his readers could have them “good cheap”, and that the quality of text was improved, if not equaled, in print. Many catalogues from the period do list both kinds indiscriminately.  However, in auctions a careful distinction was made between the two, as anything handwritten fetched a higher price.&lt;ref&gt;Lotte, p. 64-84&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popular assumptions and historical revision ===

Many scholars of [[print culture]], as well as [[classicists]], have argued that inconsistencies existed among manuscripts due to the blind copying of texts and a static manuscript culture that (specifically medieval manuscript culture) existed during the rise of the printing press.  They have stated that once a mistake was made, it would be repeated endlessly and compounded with further mistakes by refusing to deviate from the previous exemplar, thus exposing an obvious advantage of print. The noted classicist E.J. Kenney, whose work formed much of the early scholarship on this issue, stated that  “medieval authors, scribes, and readers had no notion of emending a text, when they were confronted with an obvious error in their exemplars, other than by slavishly copying the readings of another text”. There was a great diversity among them in terms of changes in style and a willingness to deviate from prior exemplars, however, as observed in [http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/medieval/jpegs/lat/th/c/1500/03101061.jpg this] copy of [[Jerome]]'s Epistolae Morale, compared to  [http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/medieval/jpegs/lat/class/c/1500/00700908.jpg this] copy of [[Cicero]]'s Letters, both dating from the 16th century.  Many historians and specifically medievalists argue that the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries demonstrated reforms that accommodated many of the functions associated with print. Also, many classicists naturally looked to reproductions of classical texts during the period, which were not necessarily characteristic of other work that was deemed more important. Universality and uniformity, medievalists believe, was seen among some late manuscripts, along with other changes typically associated with the printed book.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse 1991, p. 427-429&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the recent scholarship on Late Manuscript Culture was specifically generated by [[Elizabeth Eisenstein]],&lt;ref&gt;
Elizabeth Eisenstein, Print as an Agent of Change, 2 vols. (Cambridge: University Press, 1979). p. 328-329&lt;/ref&gt; a key print culture scholar, and arguably creator of the "print culture" model.  Eisenstein  argued that the invention of the printing press eventually led to the Renaissance, and the social conditions necessary for its occurrence.  The printing press allowed readers to free themselves from many limitations of the manuscript.  She did not detail the state of manuscript and scribal culture in the late fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, however.  She described in depth the conditions present in Germany at the time of the printing presses' invention in [[Mainz]], and detailed the scribal culture in England and France in order to compare print culture and manuscript culture. She didn't describe Italian humanists in [[Florence]] and renewed religious orders of the Modern Devotion in the Low Countries and Germany.  These included the [[Windesheim Congregation]], of which Oswald de Corda was a member.  Many medievalists, specifically Mary A. Rouse and Richard H. Rouse,  responded by attempting to  create a more detailed account of late manuscript culture, and defined its distinctive characteristics. This is part of the belief that changes occurred during the period that print culture scholars, such as Eisenstein, ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, 1991 p. 465-466&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3801">[[Image:Misrah Ghar il-Kbir 5.jpg|thumb|300px|Cart Ruts at Misrah Ghar il-Kbir]]
'''Misrah Ghar il-Kbir''' (informally known as '''Clapham Junction''') is a prehistoric site in [[Siġġiewi]], [[Malta]], near the [[Dingli Cliffs]]. It is best known for its "cart ruts" - a complex network of tracks gouged in the rock. The age and purpose of the tracks are still a mystery of Maltese history. In general, most [[archeologist]]s presume that the site developed about 2000 BC after new settlers came over from [[Sicily]] to start the [[Bronze Age]] in Malta.

It is reported that the "Clapham Junction" nickname was given by an Englishman, who later reported that it reminded him of the busy railway station [[Clapham Junction]] in [[London]].

==Origin of the tracks==
The tracks (known and signposted in Malta as Cart Ruts) can be found in a number of sites on [[Malta]] and on [[Gozo]]. [[Busewdien]] in St Paul's Bay, [[Naxxar]], [[San Gwann]] and [[Bidnija]] are good examples of cart tracks found on the Island of Malta.  Gozo's best Cart Ruts are on the Ta’ Ċenċ plateau, [[Sannat]].  The Misraћ Gћar il-Kbir site in [[Siġġiewi]] near the [[Dingli Cliffs]] in the south of the island is probably the most impressive – they form here a real "traffic jam".

Also called cart ruts, they are up to {{Convert|60|cm}} deep and have an average distance between them of {{Convert|110|to|140|cm|abbr = on}}. Some cross while others form junctions. This creates the illusion of a great railway station switching yard.

[[Image:Misrah Ghar il-Kbir 4.jpg|thumb|300px|A cart ruts junction at Ghar il-Kbir]]
There are numerous theories about how these tracks were created. The most discussed{{By whom|date = March 2016}} are the following:{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}
* Goods were transported here on sledges which gouged the tracks into the rock.
* The tracks are real cart ruts for transporting goods.
* It is an irrigation system.

There are also other attempts to explain the tracks:-
*The Maltese archeologist [[Anthony Bonanno]] thinks that the ruts are devices of the [[Phoenicia]]ns, which would mean that the tracks were made more recently, in the 7th century BC.{{Citation needed|date = March 2016}}

Research published in 2008 suggests that these may have been caused by wooden-wheeled carts eroding soft limestone. An analysis was made of the stresses that would have been caused by a cart which would fit the ruts. Professor Mottershead of Portsmouth University said "The underlying rock in Malta is weak and when it’s wet it loses about 80 per cent of its strength. The carts would have first made tracks in the soil but when that eroded, the cartwheels ran directly on the bedrock, making it easier for other carts to follow the same tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.port.ac.uk/aboutus/newsandevents/news/archive2009/april2009/title%2C94480%2Cen.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229050005/http://www.port.ac.uk/aboutus/newsandevents/news/archive2009/april2009/title,94480,en.html|title=Ancient mystery solved by geographers|date=Apr 20, 2009 |archivedate=29 December 2010|publisher=University of Portsmouth|accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mottershead, Derek; Alastair Pearson &amp; Martin Schaefer "The cart ruts of Malta: an applied geomorphology approach" ''Antiquity'' Vol 82:318, 2008 pp 1065-1079 [http://antiquity.ac.uk/Ant/082/1065/ant0821065.pdf] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 16th to the early 19th century Skanderbeg's fame survived only in Christian [[Europe]] and was based on perception of Skanderbeg being [[Antemurale Christianitatis]] against invading Turks. In largely Islamized [[Albania]] of this period his fame faded, to be rediscovered at the end of the 19th century when the figure of Skanderbeg was brought to the level of [[national hero (disambiguation)|national hero]].

While Greek references to Skanderbeg were used up, Serbian historians, often contradictorily, used Skanderbeg as a symbol of joint Serbian-Albanian progress (1866).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt|first=Oliver Jens|title=Skënderbeu|year=2008|publisher=K&amp;B|isbn=978-9995666750|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RbeSAAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9789995666750&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T3BaTpvRMuzJsQK61bTIDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA|accessdate=|page=437|language=Albanian|quote=Ndërkohë që pas 1900-s referimet greke ndaj Skënderbeut erdhën duke u shuar, propagandistët serbë në strategjitë e tyre, shpesh kontradiktore, e përdorën Skënderbeun si simbol të një ecurie të përbashkët serbe-(shqiptare) (1866)}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, forty years later, in a different political environment, the faded memory of Skanderbeg among a large portion of Albanians was used as evidence of a lack of an ethnic identity and even the said Serbian character of the medieval hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt|first=Oliver Jens|title=Skënderbeu|year=2008|publisher=K&amp;B|isbn=9789995666750 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RbeSAAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9789995666750&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T3BaTpvRMuzJsQK61bTIDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA|accessdate=|page=437|language=Albanian|quote=në anën tjetër, dyzet vjet më vonë, në rrethana të ndryshuara politike, kujtimin e zbehur për Skënderbeun në shtresat e gjera të popullsisë shqiptare si dëshmi për mungesën e ndjenjes së identit etnik madje dhe për gjoja karakterin serb të heroit mesjetar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skanderbeg in Greek literature ===
Skanderbeg was a figure featured in 19th century Greek literature.&lt;ref name="Zanou146148"/&gt; Papadopoulo Vretto published a biography on Skanderbeg and presented him as a defender of Christianity against the Muslim Ottomans and a 'proud Epirotan' descendant of king [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] of ancient Epirus.&lt;ref name="Zanou146148"/&gt; The book itself did not claim Skanderbeg as Greek, yet the text became influential in shaping a long tradition within Greek litreture that appropriated him as a Greek national hero and patriot.&lt;ref name="Zanou146148"/&gt; Greek revoltuionaries read the book and commemorated his Skanderbeg actions as ones of Greek and Christian pride.&lt;ref name="Zanou146148"/&gt; At the time as the idea of an Albanian nation consolidated Papadopoulo's book spread to the Arbereshë (Albanian) diaspora of southern Italy and it influenced Italo-Albanian intellectuals who sought to elevate figures such as Skanderbeg as an Albanian hero and differentiate themselves from Greeks.&lt;ref name="Zanou146148"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zanou|first=Konstantina|title=Transnational Patriotism in the Mediterranean, 1800-1850: Stammering the Nation|year=2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198788706|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ZflyDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Transnational+Patriotism+in+the+Mediterranean,+1800-1850:+Stammering+the+Nation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj2ptjLnrHeAhVIXCsKHT0RB8kQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Skanderbeg&amp;f=false|pages=146-148.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exploits of Skanderbeg's figure ===

Skanderbeg's [[name]], [[horse]], and [[sword]] summarize exploits of his figure:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=di Miceli |first=Francesca |author2=Zef Chiaramonte |author3=Franca Cuccia |author4=Giuseppe Barbaccia |author5=Ernesto Schiro |title= Miti e Cultura Arbereshe |url= http://www.centrointernazionalestudisulmito.com/ebooks/albanesi.pdf |accessdate= March 24, 2011 |publisher= Centro Internazionale Studi sul Mito Delegazione Siciliana |location= Italy |language= Italian |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |doi-inactive-date=|bibcode= |page= 5 |chapter= |quote= Un nome, una spada e un destriero quindi compendiano le gesta di Giorgio Kastriota...Nomen omen ...Infatti come l’eroico macedone Alessandro Magno aveva lottato contro i Greci per proteggere la sua terra così l’albanese Giorgio Kastriota lottava contro i Turci a difesa dell’Albania mettendo ...possedeva poteri magici...ma uno dei ruoli che maggiormente la caratterizza è quello di guida dell’uomo nei mpondi superiori...il suo cavallo e ciò avrebbe scatenato un enorme terrore fra i turchi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Nomen est omen]] is used in the exploitation of Skanderbeg's figure by connecting his name with [[Alexander the Great]], who defended his territory, and implying that Skanderbeg also struggled to defend his territory from the [[Ottoman Empire]].
# The sword used by Skanderbeg was a present of the sultan and was endowed with [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers.
# The horse connects the mythological hero with both earthly and spiritual powers, also making the hero look taller. The neighing of Skanderbeg's horse caused terror among his enemies.

'''''NACLA Report on the Americas''''' is a political magazine produced by the [[North American Congress on Latin America]].

==History==
The North American Congress on Latin America was founded on November 1966 by leaders of the [[New Left#The American New Left|New Left]] movement to analyze the mainstream media coverage of the [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson]] Administration's [[Operation Power Pack|invasion of the Dominican Republic]]. In 1967 the NACLA began publishing what was then known as the ''NACLA Newsletter''. Later it adopted the name ''NACLA's Latin America and Empire Report'' and in 1977 adopted its present name, ''NACLA Report on the Americas''.

The journal described itself as "the oldest and most widely read progressive magazine covering Latin America and its relationship with the United States".&lt;ref&gt;[https://nacla.org/naclareport]&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine changed from bimonthly to quarterly in 2012. It ceased print publication in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|issn=1071-4839| volume=47|issue=4|page=1|title=Dear reader| journal=NACLA Report on the Americas|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the magazine announced a return to print through a partnership with Routledge in April 2016. The relaunch of the magazine is set for May 27, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nacla.org/news/2016/04/07/nacla-returns-print NACLA returns print]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
A standard issue began with several short pieces on Latin American and Caribbean current events followed by a series of longer in-depth articles grouped in a thematic section on a particular topic of Latin American affairs and/or U.S. policy toward the region. Each issue ended with a review section on books related to Latin American and Caribbean political themes.

The phrase '''''NASCAR dad''''' broadly refers to a [[demographic]] group of often white, usually middle-aged, working-class or lower-middle-class men in [[North America]]. The group received this nickname because they are men who are believed to typically enjoy watching [[NASCAR]] racing, or comparable high-impact sports or entertainment.

The term was often used during the [[United States presidential election, 2004|United States presidential election of 2004]], particularly in describing the efforts of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] to regain the votes of white southern males. The group consists of an estimated 45 million people in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/news/story?id=1735251 NASCAR Dads could provide swing vote. ESPN.

'''Narrative paradigm''' is a communication theory conceptualized by 20th-century communication scholar [[Walter Fisher (professor)|Walter Fisher]]. The paradigm claims that all meaningful [[communication]] occurs via [[storytelling]] or [[Narrative|reporting of events]]. Humans participate as storytellers and observers of narratives. This theory further claims that stories are more persuasive than arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/blogs/militaryveterangamer/2014/01/18/narrative-paradigm-3-key-concepts|title=Narrative Paradigm 3: Key Concepts - Blog by militaryveterangamer - IGN|website=IGN|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://communicationtheory.org/the-narrative-paradigm/|title=The Narrative Paradigm|work=Communication Theory|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially the narrative paradigm helps us to explain how humans are able to understand complex information through [[narrative]].

== Background ==
The Narrative Paradigm is a theory that suggests that human beings are natural storytellers and that a good story is more convincing than a good argument. Walter Fisher developed this theory as a solution making cohesive arguments. Fisher conceptualized the paradigm as a way to combat issues in the [[public sphere]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Walter R.|date=1984-03-01|title=Narration as a human communication paradigm: The case of public moral argument|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637758409390180|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=51|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=10.1080/03637758409390180|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was that human beings were unable to make cohesive traditional arguments. At the time, rational world paradigm was the theory used to satisfy public controversies. He believed that stories have the power to include beginning, middle, and end of an argument and that the rational world paradigm fails to be effective in [[sensemaking]].&lt;ref name="Rowland 204–217"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rowland|first=Robert C.|date=1988-09-01|title=The value of the rational world and narrative papradigms|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10510978809363250|journal=Central States Speech Journal|volume=39|issue=3-4|pages=204–217|doi=10.1080/10510978809363250|issn=0008-9575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher uses the term [[paradigm]] rather than [[theory]], meaning a paradigm is broader than a theory. Fisher stated, "There is no genre, including technical communication, that is not an episode in the story of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Walter|date=1985|title=The Narrative Paradigm: An Elaboration|doi=10.1080/03637758509376117|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=52|issue=4|pages=347–367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher believed that humans are not rational and proposed that narrative is the basis of communication. According to this viewpoint, people communicate by telling/observing a persuasive story rather than by producing evidence or constructing a [[logical]] argument. The narrative paradigm is purportedly all-encompassing, allowing all communication to be looked at as a narrative even though it may not conform to the traditional literary requirements of a narrative. He states:
*Humans see the world as a set of stories. Each individual accepts stories that match his or her [[value (semiotics)|values]] and [[belief]]s, understood as [[common sense]].{{Sfn|Jameson|2001|p=}}
*Although people claim that their decisions are rational,{{Sfn|Jameson|2001|p=}} incorporating [[history]], [[culture]], and perceptions about the other people involved, all of these are subjective and incompletely understood.
*Narrative rationality requires stories to be [[probability|probable]], coherent and to exhibit [[fidelity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967775008|title=Introducing communication theory : analysis and application|last=L.,|first=West, Richard|others=Turner, Lynn H.,|isbn=1259870324|edition=Sixth|location=New York, NY|oclc=967775008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Storytelling is one of the first language skills that children develop. It is universal across cultures and time.&lt;ref&gt;Langellier, Kristin M. "Personal narratives: Perspectives on theory and research." Text and Performance Quarterly 9.4 (1989): 243–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rational world paradigm==
Walter Fisher conceptualized the Narrative Paradigm in direct contrast to the Rational World Paradigm. "Fisher's interest in narrative developed out of his conclusion that the dominant model for explaining human communication—the rational-world paradigm—was inadequate."&lt;ref name="Rowland 204–217"/&gt; Rational World Paradigm suggest that an argument is most persuasive when it is logical. This theory is based in the teachings of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lucaites |first1=John Louis |last2=Condit |first2=Celeste Michelle |last3=Caudill |first3=Sally |title=Contemporary Rhetorical Theory: A Reader |date=Jan 1, 1999 |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York |page=268 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aristotle, some statements are superior to others by virtue of their relationship to true knowledge. This view claims that:
* People are essentially thinking beings, basing their knowledge on evidence-based reasoning.
* Rational argument reflects [[knowledge]] and [[understanding]], and how the case is made. These qualities determine whether the argument is accepted, so long as the form matches the forum, which might be scientific, legal, philosophical, etc.
* The world is a set of logical puzzles that can be solved through reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/830512395|title=Interfaith dialogue : listening to communication theory|last=1959-|first=Brown, Daniel S.,|date=2013|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0739178709|location=Lanham, Md.|oclc=830512395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative rationality==
Narrative rationality requires coherence and fidelity, which contribute to judgments about reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/456170121|title=Applying communication theory for professional life : a practical introduction|last=Marianne.|first=Dainton,|date=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|others=Zelley, Elaine D.|isbn=9781412976916|edition=2nd|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|oclc=456170121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coherence===
Narrative [[Coherence (philosophical gambling strategy)|coherence]] is the degree to which a story makes sense. Coherent stories are internally consistent, with sufficient detail, reliable characters, and free of major surprises. The ability to assess coherence is learned and improves with experience. Individuals assess a story's coherence by comparing it with similar stories. The ultimate test of narrative coherence is whether the characters act in a reliable way. If characters show continuity throughout their thoughts, motives and actions, acceptance increases. However, characters behaving uncharacteristically destroys acceptance.{{sfn|Griffin|2009}}

===Fidelity===
Narrative fidelity is the degree to which a story fits into the observer's prior understanding. Stories with fidelity may influence their beliefs and values.{{sfn|Griffin|2009|p=304}}

Fisher set five criteria that affect a story's narrative fidelity:
*the values embedded in the story
*the connection between the story, and the espoused values 
*the possible outcomes that would accrue to people adhering to the espoused values
*the consistency of the narrative's values with the observer's values
*the extent to which the story’s values represent the highest values possible in human experience&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Walter R. (1987). ''Human Communication as Narration: Toward a Philosophy of Reason, Value, and Action''. Columbia: University of South Carolina Press. {{ISBN|0-87249-500-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation of reasoning systems==
Fisher's narrative paradigm offers an alternative to Aristotelian analysis, which dominates the field of rhetorical thinking. Narratives do not require training or expertise to evaluate. [[Common sense]] assesses narrative coherence and fidelity.{{Sfn|Griffin|2009|p=305}} Busselle and Bilandzic distinguish narrative rationality from realism, writing "It is remarkable that the power of narrative is not diminished by readers’ or viewers’ knowledge that the story is invented. On the contrary, successful stories—those that engage us most—often are both fictional and unrealistic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Busselle|first=Rick|last2=Bilandzic|first2=Helena|date=2008-05-01|title=Fictionality and Perceived Realism in Experiencing Stories: A Model of Narrative Comprehension and Engagement|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2008.00322.x/abstract|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=256|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2008.00322.x|issn=1468-2885|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] claimed that communications systems are formed through the ''savoir'' and ''pouvoir'' (knowledge and power) of the hierarchies that control access to the discourses. Hence, criteria for assessing the ''reliability'' and ''completeness'' of evidence, and whether the pattern of reasoning is sound are not absolutes but defined over time by those in positions of authority. This is particularly significant when the process of reasoning includes values and policy in addition to [[empirical]] data.

The narrative paradigm instead asserts that any individual can judge a story's merits as a basis for belief and action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Narration affects every aspect of each individual's life in verbal and nonverbal bids for someone to believe or act in a certain way. Even when a message appears abstract—i.e., the language is literal and not figurative—it is narration. This is because it is embedded in the storyteller's ongoing story and it invites observers to assess its value for their own lives.

Narrative rationality and narrative emotion are complementary within a narrative theory. The former considers how effectively the story conveys its meaning, as well as its implications. The latter considers the emotional reactions of the story's observers.&lt;ref name="Deslandes 335–372"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deslandes|first=Jeanne|date=2005-09-12|title=A Philosophy of Emoting|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/186846|journal=Journal of Narrative Theory|volume=34|issue=3|pages=335–372|doi=10.1353/jnt.2005.0003|issn=1548-9248}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Narrative emotion is an emotion felt for the sake of someone, or something, else.&lt;ref name="Deslandes 335–372"/&gt;

==Applications==
Narrative theory is an assessment framework within various fields of communication. Those who  use narrative theory within their research refer to it as a general way of viewing communication. The narrative paradigm is generally considered an interpretative theory of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spector-Mersel|first=Gabriela|date=2010-01-01|title=Narrative research: Time for a paradigm|url=http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/ni.20.1.10spe|journal=Narrative Inquiry|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=204–224|doi=10.1075/ni.20.1.10spe|issn=1387-6740}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an especially useful theory for teaching qualitative research methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=25592191|title=Rethinking Texts: Narrative and the Construction of Qualitative Research|first1=Karri A.|last1=Holley|first2=Julia|last2=Colyar|date=1 January 2009|publisher=|journal=Educational Researcher|volume=38|issue=9|pages=680–686|doi=10.3102/0013189x09351979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher’s theory has been considered for domains ranging from organizational communication to family interaction, to racism, and to advertising. McNamara proposed that the narrative paradigm can be used with military storytelling to enhance the perception of the United States armed services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/1d7ae8ad4dfb7a76b376382ca464d8dd/1.pdf|title=How the Narrative Paradigm Affects Military Stories - ProQuest|last=McNamara|first=Richard|date=May 8, 2014|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stutts and Barker, of [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], proposed that the Narrative Paradigm can be used to evaluate if a company's brand will be well received by consumers, by determining if the created narrative has coherence and fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stutts | first1 = Nancy B. | last2 = Barker | first2 = Randolph T. | year = 1999 | title = The use of narrative paradigm theory in assessing audience value conflict in image advertising | url = | journal = Management Communication Quarterly | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 209–244 | doi=10.1177/0893318999132002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers proposed using the narrative paradigm to evaluate ethical standards in advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bush | first1 = Alan J. | last2 = Davies Bush | first2 = Victoria | year = 1994 | title = The Narrative Paradigm as a Perspective for Improving Ethical Evaluations of Advertisements | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising | volume = 23 | issue = 3| page = 31 | doi=10.1080/00913367.1994.10673448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts used the narrative paradigm as a way to better understand the use of narrative in folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roberts | first1 = Kathleen Glenister | year = 2004 | title = Texturing the narrative paradigm: Folklore and communication | url = | journal = Communication Quarterly | volume = 52 | issue = 2| pages = 129–142 | doi=10.1080/01463370409370186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hobart proposed using narrative theory as a way to interpret urban legends and other kinds of hoaxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hobart | first1 = Melissa | year = 2013 | title = My Best Friend's Brother's Cousin Knew This Guy Who…: Hoaxes, Legends, Warnings, and Fisher's Narrative Paradigm | url = | journal = Communication Teacher | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 90–93 | doi=10.1080/17404622.2013.770155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative paradigm is also applicable when assessing multinational working relationships. Global interactions between groups with different backgrounds have the tendency to hinder group progress and building relationships. Over the past two decades, scholars conceptualize diversity in the workplace using several different theories. As companies continue to diversify, businesses look for communication models to help manage the complex structure of human relationships. Narrative paradigm serves as a communication technique that shows companies how the application of a good story could provide benefits in the workforce. Storytelling is a cross-cultural solution that establishes credibility and trust in relationships between workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=Randolph T.|last2=Gower|first2=Kim|date=2010-07-01|title=Strategic Application of Storytelling in Organizations: Toward Effective Communication in a Diverse World|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0021943610369782|journal=The Journal of Business Communication (1973)|language=en|volume=47|issue=3|pages=295–312|doi=10.1177/0021943610369782|issn=0021-9436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative and politics===
One example of a study that used narrative theory more directly was conducted by Smith in 1984.  Smith looked at the fidelity and coherence of narratives presented as [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[Party platform|platforms]] in the United States and found that despite obvious differences, each party was able to maintain coherence and fidelity by remaining consistent in both structure and overarching party values.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative and health communication===
A study claimed that narrative features can be strategically altered by health communicators to affect the reader's identification. It found that similarities between the reader and the narrative's protagonist, but not the narrator's point of view, has a direct impact on the narrative's persuasiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Meng|last2=Bell|first2=Robert A.|date=August 2, 2016|title=Narrator Point of View and Persuasion in Health Narratives: The Role of Protagonist–Reader Similarity, Identification, and Self-Referencing|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2016.1177147|journal=Journal of Health Communication|volume=21|issue=8|pages=908–918|doi=10.1080/10810730.2016.1177147|pmid=27411000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Narrative and branding===
Narrative processing can create or enhance connections between a brand and an audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edson Escalas|first=|year=|title=Narrative Processing: Building Consumer Connections to Brands|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057740804701448|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|volume=14|pages=164–180|via=|doi=10.1207/s15327663jcp1401&amp;2_19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies and business use stories or brands that suggest a story to produce [[brand loyalty]]. Businesses invest heavily in creating a good story through advertising and public relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stutts|first=Nancy B.|last2=Barker|first2=Randolph T.|date=2016-08-15|title=The Use of Narrative Paradigm Theory in Assessing Audience Value Conflict in Image Advertising|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0893318999132002|journal=Management Communication Quarterly|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=209–244|doi=10.1177/0893318999132002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In brand development, many marketers focus on defining a brand [[persona (marketing)|persona]] (typical user) before constructing a narrative for that brand. Character traits such as honesty, curiosity, flexibility and determination become embedded in the persona. Commitment to the associated behavioral implications can help the brand maintain consistency with its narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephen Herskovitz|first=|date=May 4, 2010|title=The essential brand persona: storytelling and branding|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/02756661011036673|journal=Journal of Business Strategy|volume=31|pages=21–28|via=|doi=10.1108/02756661011036673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of the narrative paradigm mainly contend that it is not as universally applicable as Fisher suggests. For example, Rowland asserted that it should be applied strictly to communication that fits classic narrative patterns to avoid undermining its credibility.{{sfn|Rowland|1989}}

Other critiques include issues of conservative bias. Kirkwood stated that Fisher's logic of good reasons focuses only on prevailing issues&lt;ref&gt;Kirkwood, William G. (1992) "Narrative and the Rhetoric of Possibility" (Vol. 59, Issue 1) pp30–47.&lt;/ref&gt; but does not see all the ways that stories can promote [[social change]].&lt;ref name="Turner, Lynn H. 2007"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=qEhTpwAACAAJ}}|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|last1=West|first1=Richard L.|last2=Turner|first2=Lynn H.|date=December 2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-132647-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some ways, both Kirkwood and Fisher agree that this observation is more of an extension to the theory than a critique.

Stroud considered "multivalent" narratives that include seemingly contradictory values or positions that force a reader to reconstruct their meaning, thereby enabling positive judgments of narrative fidelity and the adoption of new values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stroud | first1 = Scott R | year = 2002 | title = Multivalent Narratives: Extending the Narrative Paradigm with Insights from Ancient Indian Philosophical Texts | url = | journal = Western Journal of Communication | volume = 66 | issue = 3| pages = 369–393 | doi=10.1080/10570310209374742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some forms of communication are not narrative in the way that Fisher maintains. Many [[science fiction]] and fantasy novels/movies challenge rather than conform to common values.&lt;ref name="Turner, Lynn H. 2007" /&gt;

The narrative approach does not provide a more democratic structure compared to the one imposed by the rational world paradigm. Nor does it offer a complete alternative to that paradigm.{{sfn|Rowland|1989|p=39}}
The narrative paradigm gained attention from poststructuralist education theorists for appealing to notions of truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=d498cc1b-1b67-4073-8139-f40e460ba9cd%40sessionmgr101&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWlwLHVpZCZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=91821607&amp;db=ofm|title=Narrative Theory Versus Truth: A Poststructuralist Reading in Environmental Education.|last=Hardy|first=Joy|date=June 1, 2012|website=Ebsco Host|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related theories==
===Rhetoric theory===
The narrative paradigm incorporates both the pathos and logos form of rhetoric theory. Rhetoric theory was formulated by Aristotle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Michel|date=2012-09-11|title=Aristotle’s Rhetoric|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11245-012-9132-0|journal=Topoi|volume=32|pages=249–252|doi=10.1007/s11245-012-9132-0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines rhetoric as: the available means of persuasion.&lt;ref name="Turner, Lynn H. 2007" /&gt; It includes two assumptions.
* Effective public speakers must consider their audience.
* Effective public speakers supply proofs.
Aristotle divided public speaking into three parts: the speaker, the subject and the audience. He considered the audience the most important, determining the speech’s end and object. Therefore, audience analysis, which is the process of evaluating an audience and its background is essential.

In the second assumption, Aristotle’s proof refers to the means of persuasion. And these three proof types are [[Ethos]], [[Pathos]] and [[Logos]].
* Ethos: The perceived character, intelligence and goodwill of a speaker as they become revealed through his or her speech. 
* Logos: The logic proof that speakers employ. 
* Pathos: The emotions that are drawn out of listeners. 
Rhetoric theory can be applied in multiple areas, such as in the social/environmental report,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Higgins|first=Colin|year=September 2012|title=Ethos, logos, pathos: Strategies of persuasion in social/environmental reports|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0155998212000178|journal=Accounting Forum|volume=36|pages=194–208|via=|doi=10.1016/j.accfor.2012.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Facebook]] post, etc.

===Situation models===
When people experience a story, the comprehension phase is where they form a mental representation of the text.&lt;ref&gt;Zwann, Rolf. "Current Directions In Psychological Science." Current Directions In Psychological Science. n. 15. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a mental representation is called a situation model. Situation models are representations of the state of affairs described in a text rather than of the text itself. Much of the research suggests that observers behave as though they are in the story rather than outside of it. This supports Fisher’s model that narrative components supported by good reasons are related to components in situation models.

====Space====
Situation models represent relevant aspects of the narrative's environment. Objects that are spatially close to observers are generally more relevant than more distant objects. The same holds for situation models. Observers are similarly slower to recognize words denoting objects distant from a protagonist than those close to the protagonist.{{sfn|Glenberg|Meyer|Lindem|1987|p=}} When observers have extensive knowledge of the spatial layout of the story setting (e.g., a building), they update their representations according to the location and goals of the protagonist. They have the fastest mental access to the room that the protagonist is close to. For example, they can more readily say whether two objects are in the same room if the room mentioned is close to the protagonist. The interpretation of the meaning of a verb denoting the movement of people or objects in space, such as to approach, depends on their situation models. The interpretation of observers also depends on the size of the landmark and the speed of the figure. Observers behave as if they are actually present in the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zwaan|first=Rolf A.|date=1999|title=Situation Models: The Mental Leap into Imagined Worlds|jstor=20182546|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=8|issue=1|pages=15–18|doi=10.2307/20182546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Goals and causation====
In one study observers recognized goals yet to be accomplished by the protagonist more quickly than goals that had just been accomplished. When Keefe and McDaniel presented subjects with sentences such as "after standing through a 3-hour debate, the tired speaker walked over to his chair (and sat down)" and then with probe words (e.g., "sat").&lt;ref&gt;Zwann, Rolf. "Current Directions In Psychological Science." Current Directions In Psychological Science. n. page. Print. Keefe and McDaniel (1993 )&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects took about the same amount of time to name sat when the clause about the speaker sitting down was omitted and when it was included. Moreover, naming times were significantly faster in both of these conditions than in a control condition, in which it was implied that the speaker remained standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keefe|first=D.E.|last2=Mcdaniel|first2=M.A.|title=The Time Course and Durability of Predictive Inferences|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0749596X83710247|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=32|issue=4|pages=446–463|doi=10.1006/jmla.1993.1024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Transylvanian History Museum 1.JPG|thumb|300px|National Museum of Transylvanian History]]
The '''National Museum of Transylvanian History''' ({{lang-ro|Muzeul Național de Istorie a Transilvaniei}}) is a history and archaeology [[museum]] in the city of [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Romania]]. It features a permanent exhibition, as well as temporary exhibitions, the "Tezaur" exhibition, and Pharmacy Historical collection&amp;mdash;this last opened in the [[Cluj-Napoca Hintz House|Hintz House]], an historical building in the city's center.

The beginnings of the museum date back to 1859 with the foundation of the [[Society of the Transylvanian Museum]], featuring collections of [[antiquities]] and botanical, zoological and mineralogical specimens. In 1929 the collection of artefacts was transferred to the [[Romanian Institute of Classical Studies]]. After several further movements, caused by lack of space, the collection was reopened in 1937 at its current site in [[Piaţa Muzeului]] ([[Constantin Daicoviciu]] street), in the center of Cluj-Napoca.

==Permanent collection==
The permanent collection is organized in chronological order.

===Prehistory===
{{See also|Prehistory of Transylvania}}
The longest period in the history of mankind, developing from times when the writing was still unknown. Chronologically it stretches from [[Paleolithic]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age]] to [[Iron Age]]. The National Museum of Transylvanian History offers a vast collection of [[Iclod culture]], [[Petrești culture]], [[Wietenberg culture]] and [[Noua culture]]. It hosts the biggest [[hoard]] bronze artifacts in [[Europe]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}.

'''Panoramic paintings''' are massive artworks that reveal a wide, all-encompassing [[Panorama|view]] of a particular subject, often a [[landscape]], military battle, or historical event. They became especially popular in the 19th century in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]], inciting opposition from some writers of [[Romantic poetry]]. A few have survived into the 21st century and are on public display.

In [[China]], panoramic paintings are an important subset of [[handscroll]] paintings, with some famous examples being ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' and ''Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River''.

==History==

{{wide image|Gu Hongzhong's Night Revels 2.jpg|1000px|Panorama of a half section of ''[[Night Revels of Han Xizai]]'', 12th century Song Dynasty painting}}

The word "[[panorama]]", from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''pan'' ("all") ''horama'' ("view") was coined by the [[Irish people|Irish]] painter [[Robert Barker (painter)|Robert Barker]] in 1792 to describe his paintings of [[Edinburgh]], Scotland shown on a cylindrical surface, which he soon was exhibiting in [[London, England|London]], as "The Panorama".
[[File:Cross-section-of-the-rotund 0.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cross-section of the Rotunda in Leicester Square in which the panorama of London was exhibited (1801)]]
In 1793 Barker moved his panoramas to the first purpose-built brick panorama rotunda building in the world, in [[Leicester Square]], and made a fortune.

Viewers flocked to pay a stiff 3 [[shilling]]s to stand on a central platform under a skylight, which offered an even lighting, and get an experience that was "[[Panorama|panoramic]]" (an adjective that didn't appear in print until 1813). The extended meaning of a "comprehensive survey" of a subject followed sooner, in 1801. Visitors to Barker's Panorama of London, painted as if viewed from the roof of Albion Mills on the South Bank, could purchase a series of six prints that modestly recalled the experience; end-to-end the prints stretched 3.25&amp;nbsp;metres. In contrast, the actual panorama spanned 250 square metres.&lt;ref name="comment4"&gt;Comment 1999, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the success of Barker's first panorama in Leicester Square, it was neither his first attempt at the craft nor his first exhibition. In 1788 Barker showcased his first panorama.&lt;ref name="comment4" /&gt; It was only a semi-circular view of Edinburgh, Scotland, and Barker's inability to bring the image to a full 360 degrees disappointed him.&lt;ref name="comment4" /&gt; To realize his true vision, Barker and his son, [[Henry Aston Barker]], took on the task of painting a scene of the Albion Mills.&lt;ref name="comment4" /&gt; The first version of what was to be Barker's first successful panorama was displayed in a purpose-built wooden rotunda in the back garden of the Barker home and measured only 137 square metres.&lt;ref name="comment4" /&gt;

Barker's accomplishment involved sophisticated manipulations of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] not encountered in the panorama's predecessors, the wide-angle "prospect" of a city familiar since the 16th century, or [[Wenceslas Hollar]]'s ''[[Long View of London from Bankside]]'', etched on several contiguous sheets. When Barker first patented his technique in 1787, he had given it a French title: ''La Nature à Coup d' Oeil'' ("Nature at a glance"). A sensibility to the "[[picturesque]]" was developing among the educated class, and as they toured picturesque districts, like the [[Lake District]], they might have in the carriage with them a large lens set in a picture frame, a "landscape glass" that would contract a wide view into a "picture" when held at arm's length.

Barker made many efforts to increase the realism of his scenes. To fully immerse the audience in the scene, all borders of the canvas were concealed.&lt;ref name="ellis"&gt;Ellis 2008, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Props were also strategically positioned on the platform where the audience stood and two windows were laid into the roof to allow natural light to flood the canvases.&lt;ref&gt;Comment 1999, p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Two scenes could be exhibited in the rotunda simultaneously, however the rotunda at Leicester Square was the only one to do so.&lt;ref name="comment5"&gt;Comment 1999, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Houses with single scenes proved more popular to audiences as the fame of the panorama spread.&lt;ref name="comment5" /&gt; Because the Leicester Square rotunda housed two panoramas, Barker needed a mechanism to clear the minds of the audience as they moved from one panorama to the other. To accomplish this, patrons walked down a dark corridor and up a long flight of stairs where their minds were supposed to be refreshed for viewing the new scene.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2005, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the immense size of the panorama, patrons were given orientation plans to help them navigate the scene.&lt;ref name="comment3"&gt;Comment 1999, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; These glorified maps pinpointed key buildings, sites, or events exhibited on the canvas.&lt;ref name="comment3" /&gt;
[[File:Detail from Rudolph Ackermann's painting of 1829 Colosseum.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Detail from ''Bird's Eye View from the Staircase &amp; the Upper Part of the Pavilion in the Colosseum, Regent's Park (1829)'', a coloured [[aquatint]] by [[Rudolph Ackermann]]. Sometimes the viewing position was physically recreated in the panorama's rotunda. The distant image of London shown here is the painted backdrop of the panorama.]]

To create a panorama, artists travelled to the sites and sketched the scenes multiple times.&lt;ref name="comment2"&gt;Comment 1999, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Typically a team of artists worked on one project with each team specializing in a certain aspect of the painting such as landscapes, people or skies.&lt;ref name="comment2" /&gt; After completing their sketches, the artists typically consulted other paintings, of average size, to add further detail.&lt;ref name="comment2" /&gt; Martin Meisel described the panorama perfectly in his book Realizations: "In its impact, the Panorama was a comprehensive form, the representation not of the segment of a world, but of a world entire seen from a focal height."&lt;ref name="meisel"&gt;Meisel 1983, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Though the artists painstakingly documented every detail of a scene, by doing so they created a world complete in and of itself.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2005, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The first panoramas depicted urban settings, such as cities, while later panoramas depicted nature and famous military battles.&lt;ref&gt;Comment 1999, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; The necessity for military scenes increased in part because so many were taking place. French battles commonly found their way to rotundas thanks to the feisty leadership of Napoleon Bonaparte.&lt;ref name="comment5" /&gt; Henry Aston Barker's travels to France during the Peace of Amiens led him to court, where Bonaparte accepted him.&lt;ref name="comment5" /&gt; Henry Aston created panoramas of Bonaparte's battles including ''The Battle of Waterloo'', which saw so much success that he retired after finishing it.&lt;ref&gt;Comment 1999, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Aston's relationship with Bonaparte continued following Bonaparte's exile to Elba, where Henry Aston visited the former emperor.&lt;ref name="comment5" /&gt; [[Pierre Prévost (painter)]] (1764–1823) was the first important French panorama painter. Among his 17 panoramas, the most famous describe the cities of [[Rome]], [[Naples]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Athens]] and also the battle of [[Wagram]].

Outside of England and France, the popularity of panoramas depended on the type of scene displayed. Typically, people wanted to see images from their own countries or from England. This principle rang true in Switzerland, where views of the Alps dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Comment 1999, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise in America, New York City panoramas found popularity, as well as imports from Barker's rotunda.&lt;ref&gt;Comment 1999, p. 55-56&lt;/ref&gt; As painter John Vanderlyn soon found out, French politics did not interest Americans.&lt;ref name="comment1"&gt;Comment 1999, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, his depiction of Louis XVIII's return to the throne did not live two months in the rotunda before a new panorama took its place.&lt;ref name="comment1" /&gt;
[[File:Battery of Raevsky.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Nikolay Raevsky|Raevsky]] Battery at Borodino, a fragment of [[Franz Roubaud|Roubaud]]'s panoramic painting]]
Barker's Panorama was hugely successful and spawned a series of "immersive" panoramas: the Museum of London's curators found mention of 126 panoramas that were exhibited between 1793 and 1863. In Europe, panoramas were created of historical events and battles, notably by the Russian painter [[Franz Roubaud]]. Most major European cities featured more than one purpose-built structure hosting panoramas. These large fixed-circle panoramas declined in popularity in the latter third of the nineteenth century, though in the [[United States]] they experienced a partial revival; in this period, they were more commonly referred to as [[cyclorama]]s.

The panorama competed for audiences most frequently with the [[diorama]], a slightly curved or flat canvas extending 22 by 14&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref name="comment7"&gt;Comment 1999, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The diorama was invented in 1822 by [[Louis Daguerre]] and Charles-Marie Bouton, the latter a former student of the renowned French painter [[Jacques-Louis David]].&lt;ref name="comment7" /&gt;

Unlike the panorama where spectators had to move to view the scene, the scenes on the diorama moved so the audience could remain seated.&lt;ref name="comment6"&gt;Comment 1999, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Accomplished with four screens on a roundabout, the illusion captivated 350 spectators at a time for a period of 15&amp;nbsp;minutes.&lt;ref name="comment6" /&gt; The images rotated in a 73 degree arc, focusing on two of the four scenes while the remaining two were prepared, which allowed the canvases to be refreshed throughout the course of the show.&lt;ref name="meisel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="comment6" /&gt; While topographical detail was crucial to panoramas, as evidenced by the teams of artists who worked on them, the effect of the illusion took precedence with the diorama.&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;Thomas 2005, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Painters of the diorama also added their own twist to the panorama's props, but instead of props to make the scenes more real, they incorporated sounds.&lt;ref name="thomas" /&gt; Another similarity to the panorama was the effect the diorama had on its audience. Some patrons experienced a stupor, while others were alienated by the spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2005, p. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; The alienation of the diorama was caused by the connection the scene drew to art, nature and death.&lt;ref name="thomas1"&gt;Thomas 2005, p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; After Daguerre and Bouton's first exhibition in London, one reviewer noted a stillness like that "of the grave."&lt;ref name="thomas1" /&gt; To remedy this tomblike atmosphere Daguerre painted both sides of the canvas, known as "the double effect."&lt;ref name="thomas1" /&gt; By lighting both painted sides of the canvas, light was transmitted and reflected producing a type of transparency producing the effect of time passing.&lt;ref name="meisel" /&gt; This effect gave the crew operating the lights and turning the roundabout a new type of control over the audience than the panorama ever had.&lt;ref name="meisel" /&gt;

In Britain and particularly in the [[United States|US]], the panoramic ideal was intensified by unrolling a canvas-backed scroll past the viewer in a ''[[Moving Panorama]],'' an alteration of an idea that was familiar in the hand-held landscape scrolls of [[Song dynasty]]. First unveiled in 1809 in Edinburgh, Scotland, the moving panorama required a large canvas and two vertical rollers to be set up on a stage.&lt;ref name="wilcox"&gt;Wilcox 2007, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Marshall added the twist to Barker's original creation, which saw success throughout the 19th and into the 20th century.&lt;ref name="wilcox" /&gt; The scene or variation of scenes passed between the rollers, eliminating the need to showcase and view the panorama in a rotunda.&lt;ref name="wilcox" /&gt; A precursor to [[Film|"moving" pictures]], the moving panorama incorporated music, sound effects and stand-alone cut-outs to create their mobile effect.&lt;ref name="meisel" /&gt; Such a traveling motion allowed for new types of scenes, such as chase sequences, that could not be produced so well in either the diorama or the panorama.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel, 1983, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast specifically to the diorama, where the audience seemed to be physically rotated, the moving panorama gave patrons a new perspective, allowing them to "[function] as a moving eye".&lt;ref name="meisel" /&gt;

==Romantic criticism of panoramas==

The panorama's rise in popularity was a result of its accessibility in that people did not need a certain level of education to enjoy the views it offered.&lt;ref name="ellis2"&gt;Ellis 2008, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, patrons from across the social scale flocked to rotundas throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="ellis2" /&gt;

While easy access was an attraction of the panorama, some people believed it was nothing more than a parlor trick bent on deceiving its public audience. Designed to have a lingering effect upon the viewer, the panorama was placed in the same category as propaganda of the period, which was also seen as deceitful.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2005, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The locality paradox also attributed to the arguments of panorama critics.&lt;ref name="ellis" /&gt; A phenomenon resulting from immersion in a panorama, the locality paradox happened when people were unable to distinguish where they were: in the rotunda or at the scene they were seeing.&lt;ref name="ellis" /&gt;

Writers feared the panorama for the simplicity of its illusion. [[Hester Piozzi]] was among those who rebelled against the growing popularity of the panorama for precisely this reason.&lt;ref name="ellis2" /&gt; She did not like seeing so many people – elite and otherwise – fooled by something so simple.&lt;ref name="ellis2" /&gt;

Another problem with the panorama was what it came to be associated with, namely, by redefining the sublime to incorporate the material.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2006, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; In their earliest forms, panoramas depicted topographical scenes and in so doing, made the sublime accessible to every person with 3 shillings in his or her pocket.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox 2007, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The sublime became an everyday thing and therefore, a material commodity. By associating the sublime with the material, the panorama was seen as a threat to romanticism, which was obsessed with the sublime.&lt;ref&gt;Jones 2006, p.360&lt;/ref&gt; According to the romantics, the sublime was never supposed to include materiality and by linking the two, panoramas tainted the sublime.

The poet [[William Wordsworth]] has long been characterized as an opponent of the panorama, most notably for his allusion to it in Book Seven of ''[[The Prelude]]''.&lt;ref name="ellis1"&gt;Ellis 2008, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that Wordsworth's problem with the panorama was the deceit it used to gain popularity.&lt;ref name="haut"&gt;Haut 2009, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; He felt, critics say, that the panorama not only exhibited an immense scene of some kind, but also the weakness of human intelligence.&lt;ref name="ellis1" /&gt; Wordsworth was offended by the fact that so many people found panoramas irresistible and concluded that people were not smart enough to see through the charade.&lt;ref name="ellis1" /&gt; Because of his argument in "The Prelude," it is safe to assume Wordsworth saw a panorama at some point during his life, but it is unknown which one he saw; there is no substantial proof he ever went, other than his description in the poem.&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;Jones 2006, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Wordsworth's hatred of the panorama was not limited to its deceit. The panorama's association with the sublime was likewise offensive to the poet as were other spectacles of the period that competed with reality.&lt;ref&gt;Miles 2005, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; As a poet, Wordsworth sought to separate his craft from the [[phantasmagoria]] enveloping the population.&lt;ref&gt;Miles 2005, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, phantasmagoria refers to signs and other circulated propaganda, including billboards, illustrated newspapers and panoramas themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Miles 2005, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; Wordsworth's biggest problem with panoramas was their pretense: the panorama lulled spectators into stupors, inhibiting their ability to imagine things for themselves.&lt;ref name="haut" /&gt; Wordsworth wanted people to see the representation depicted in the panorama and appreciate it for what it was – art.&lt;ref name="ellis1" /&gt;

Conversely, some critics argue Wordsworth was not opposed to the panorama, but was rather hesitant about it.&lt;ref name="jones" /&gt; A main argument is that other episodes in ''The Prelude'' have just as much sensory depth as panoramas had.&lt;ref name="jones1"&gt;Jones 2006, p. 366-367&lt;/ref&gt; Such depth could only be accomplished through imitation of the human senses, something both the panorama and ''The Prelude'' succeed at.&lt;ref name="jones1" /&gt; Therefore, since both the panorama and ''The Prelude'' imitate the senses, they are equal and suggest Wordsworth was not entirely opposed to panoramas.

A modern take on the panorama believes the enormous paintings filled a hole in the lives of those who lived during the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="comment"&gt;Comment 1999, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Comment said in his book ''The Painted Panorama,'' that the masses needed "absolute dominance" and the illusion offered by the panorama gave them a sense of organization and control.&lt;ref name="comment" /&gt; Despite the power it wielded, the panorama detached audiences from the scene they viewed, replacing reality and encouraging them to watch the world rather than experience it.&lt;ref name="comment" /&gt;

==Surviving panoramas==
Relatively few of these unwieldy ephemera survive. The oldest known surviving panorama (completed in 1814 by [[:de:Marquard Wocher|Marquard Wocher]]) is on display at [[Schadau Castle]], depicting an average morning in the Swiss town of [[Thun]]. As of today it is owned by the [[Gottfried Keller-Stiftung|Gottfried Keller Foundation]].&lt;ref name="hds-GKS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D11909.php|title=Gottfried Keller-Stiftung|publisher=HDS|author=Claude Lapaire|language=German|date=2006-11-14|accessdate=2014-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="landbote-20111123"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landbote.ch/index.php?id=18&amp;tx_vsarticle_pi1%5Barticle%5D=171093|title=Bund greift Gottfried-Keller-Stiftung unter die Arme|publisher=[[Der Landbote]]/sda|author=|language=German|date=2011-11-23|accessdate=2014-12-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208015305/http://www.landbote.ch/index.php?id=18&amp;tx_vsarticle_pi1%5Barticle%5D=171093|archivedate=2014-12-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another rare surviving great-circle panorama is the [[Panorama Mesdag]], completed in 1881 and housed in a purpose-built museum in [[The Hague]], showing the dunes of nearby [[Scheveningen]]. Both of these works are considered of interest as they depict domestic scenes of their times. Depictions of warfare were more common as subject matter, [[Panorama of the Battle of Waterloo|an example]] of which is located at the battlefield of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], depicting the [[Battle of Waterloo|battle]].

An exhibition "Panoramania" was held at the [[Barbican Arts Centre|Barbican]] in the 1980s, with a catalog by [[Ralph Hyde]]. The [[Racławice Panorama]], currently located in [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]], is a monumental (15 × 120&amp;nbsp;metre) panoramic painting depicting the [[Battle of Racławice]], during the [[Kościuszko Uprising]]. A panorama of the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] is on display at [[Mamayev Kurgan]]. Among [[Franz Roubaud]]'s great panoramas, those depicting the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854)|Siege of Sevastopol]] (1905) and [[Battle of Borodino]] (1911) survive, although the former was damaged during the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1942)]] and the latter was transferred to [[Poklonnaya Gora]]. The [[Pleven Panorama]] in [[Pleven]], [[Bulgaria]], depicts the events of the [[Siege of Plevna]] in 1877 on a 115×15-metre canvas with a 12-meter foreground.

Five large panoramas survive in [[North America]]: the [[Cyclorama of Jerusalem]] (a.k.a. the Panorama of Jerusalem at the Moment of Christ's Death) at St. Anne, outside of [[Quebec City]]; the [[Gettysburg Cyclorama]] depicting [[Pickett's Charge]] during the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]]; [[John Vanderlyn]]'s Panorama of the Garden and [[Palace of Versailles]] at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]]] and the [[Atlanta Cyclorama]], which depicts the [[Battle of Atlanta]], in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. A fifth panorama, also depicting the Battle of Gettysburg, was willed in 1996 to [[Wake Forest University]] in [[North Carolina]]; it is in poor condition and not on public display. It was purchased in 2007 by a group of North Carolina investors who hope to resell it to someone willing to restore it. Only pieces survive of a massive cyclorama depicting the [[Battle of Shiloh]].

In the area of the [[moving panorama]], there are somewhat more extant, though many are in poor repair and the conservation of such enormous paintings poses very expensive problems. The most notable rediscovered panorama in the [[United States]] was the Great Moving Panorama of Pilgrim's Progress, which was found in storage at the [[York Institute]] now the Saco Museum in [[Saco, Maine]], by its former curator Tom Hardiman. It was found to incorporate designs by many of the leading painters of its day, including [[Jasper Francis Cropsey]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], and [[Henry Courtney Selous]] (Selous was the in-house painter for the original Barker panorama in London for many years.)

The [[St. Louis Art Museum]] owns another moving panorama, which it is conserving in public during the summers of 2011 and 2012. "The Panorama of the Monumental Grandeur of the Mississippi Valley" — the only remaining of six known Mississippi River panorama paintings—measures {{convert|90|in|m|order=flip|abbr=off}} wide by {{convert|348|ft|m|abbr=off|order=flip}} long and was commissioned {{circa|1850}} by an eccentric amateur archaeologist named Montroville W. Dickeson. [[Judith H. Dobrzynski]] wrote about the restoration in [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303836404577474852766704394 an article in the Wall Street Journal dated June 27, 2012].

In 1918, the [[New Bedford Whaling Museum]] acquired the [http://whalingmuseumblog.org/2010/08/04/revisiting-the-content-and-context-of-russell-and-purrington%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98grand-panorama-of-a-whaling-voyage-round-the-world%E2%80%99/ Grand Panorama of a Whaling Voyage Round the World], created by artists Benjamin Russell and Caleb Purrington in 1848. At about {{convert|1295|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|8+1/2|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} high, it is one of the largest surviving moving panoramas (although far short of the "Three Miles [4800&amp;nbsp;m] of Canvass" advertised by its creators in their handbills). The Museum is currently planning for the [http://www.whalingmuseum.org/explore/collections/panorama conservation] of the Grand Panorama. Although in storage, highlights may be seen on the Museum's [https://www.flickr.com/photos/nbwm/sets/72157623043914197/with/4861121110/ Flickr] pages

Another moving panorama was donated to the Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection at Brown University Library in 2005. Painted in Nottingham, England around 1860 by John James Story (d. 1900), it depicts the life and career of the great Italian patriot, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] (1807–1882). The panorama stands about {{convert|4+1/2|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|273|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long, painted on both sides in watercolor. Numerous battles and other dramatic events in his life are depicted in 42 scenes, and the original narration written in ink survives.

The ''[[Arrival of the Hungarians]]'', a vast cyclorama by [[Árpád Feszty]] ''et al.'', completed in 1894, is displayed at the [[Ópusztaszer National Heritage Park]] in [[Hungary]]. It was made to commemorate the 1000th anniversary of the 895 conquest of the [[Carpathian Basin]] by the Hungarians.

The Cyclorama of Early Melbourne, by artist John Hennings in 1892, still survives albeit having suffered water damage during a fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlymelbourne.com.au/cyclorama-of-early-melbourne#.V7L1jGV4X8s |title=Only Melbourne Cyclorama of Early Melbourne |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016 |website=Only Melbourne|publisher=Ripefruit Media Co. |access-date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painted from a panoramic sketch of Early Melbourne in 1842 by Samuel Jackson. It places the viewer on top of the partially constructed Scott's Church on Collins Street in the Melbourne CBD. Commissioned to celebrate 50 years of the city of Melbourne, it was displayed in the Melbourne Exhibition Building for nearly 30 years before being taken into storage. Relatively small for a Cyclorama, it measured {{convert|36|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM00433b.htm |title=eMelbourne Cycloramas |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2008 |website=eMelbourne - The Encyclopedia of Melbourne Online |publisher=School of Historical &amp; Philosophical Studies, The University of Melbourne |access-date=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Biological museum (Stockholm)]], founded by hunter and taxidermist Gustaf Kolthoff, opened its dioramas to the public in November 1893 and is still an active museum with about 15000 visitors yearly. The museum has panorama paintings by [[Bruno Liljefors]] (assisted by [[Gustaf Fjæstad]]), Kjell Kolthoff and several hundred preserved animals in their natural habitats.

'''Robert Eisenman''' (born 1937) is an American [[biblical scholar]], theoretical writer, historian, [[archaeology|archaeologist]], and "road" poet. He is currently professor of Middle East religions, archaeology, and Islamic law and director of the Institute for the Study of
Judaeo-Christian Origins at [[California State University Long Beach]].

Eisenman led the campaign to free up access to the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] in the 1980s and 90s, and, as a result of this campaign, is associated with the theory that combines [[Essenes]] with Palestinian messianism (or what some might refer to as "Palestinian Christianity") — a theory opposed to establishment or [[Scientific consensus|consensus]] scholarship.

Before this, Eisenman spent five years "on the road" in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East as far as India, encapsulating all these things in his poetic travel ''Diario'' (1959–62), published in 2007 by [[North Atlantic Books]], Berkeley, California and called ''The New Jerusalem'', in which he describes the San Francisco "[[Beat Generation|Beat]]" scene in 1958–59, Paris when still a "[[moveable feast]]", working on [[kibbutzim]] in Israel, the [[Peace Corps]], and several voyages on the overland route to India.

==Life and career==
Robert Eisenman is from [[New Jersey]]. He was born to assimilated Jewish parents&lt;ref name="longing"&gt;Eran Neuman, ''Longing for the Impossible'', [http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/culture/leisure/longing-for-the-impossible-1.289816  Haaretz, 12 May 2010]. Quote (referring to his brother, Peter Eisenman): ''"I didn't know I was Jewish until I encountered anti-Semitism at the age of 10..." Even though he grew up in a non-Zionist and assimilated family where his father held radical leftist views....''&lt;/ref&gt; His brother is [[Deconstructivism|deconstructionist architect]] [[Peter Eisenman]] — best known for his design of the [[Holocaust Memorial]] in [[Berlin]], the Visitor’s Center at [[Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Spain]], and the [[University of Phoenix Stadium|Arizona Cardinal Football Stadium]].

===Education===
Eisenman (like [[Thomas Pynchon]]&lt;ref&gt;Ron Rosenbaum, "The Riddle of the Scrolls, “ Vanity Fair, November, 1992, pp. 224–28 and  Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, ''The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception'', pp. xvii–xvii&lt;/ref&gt;) majored for two and a half years in [[Engineering Physics]] (a course which was intended to prepare students to enter [[nuclear physics]]), graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Cornell University]] in Physics and Philosophy in 1958. He received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] Degree in [[Hebrew]] and Near Eastern Studies with [[Abraham I. Katsh]] from [[New York University]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;California State University Website http://www.csulb.edu/centers/sjco/aboutpre.html&lt;/ref&gt; He received a Ph.D. Degree from [[Columbia University]] in  Middle East languages and cultures in 1971 with a minor in [[Jewish Studies]] and a major in [[Islamic law]], where he studied with [[Joseph Schacht]]. He was a [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] fellow at the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]], 1985–86 and, in 1986–87, he was a senior research fellow at the [[Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies]], [[Oxford]], [[England]].

===Current position===
He is professor of Middle East religions, archaeology, and Islamic law and the director of the Institute for the Study of [[Judeo-Christian]] and [[Islamic]] Origins at [[California State University Long Beach]]. He is also a visiting senior member of [[Linacre College]], [[Oxford University]], and was a National Endowment for the Humanities fellow at the Albright Institute of Archaeological Research (American Schools of Oriental Research) in Jerusalem.

===Early life===
Eisenman grew up in [[South Orange, New Jersey]] and went to [[Columbia High School (New Jersey)|Columbia High School]] in [[Maplewood, New Jersey|Maplewood]], but skipped his senior year to take up an acceptance in the Engineering Physics Department at [[Cornell University]]. In his junior year Eisenman moved, first to Philosophy to study with [[Max Black]], then on to [[Comparative Literature]] with [[John Senior]], and then back to Philosophy to graduate in 1958 with a major in [[Aesthetics]] and a minor in Physics.

===On the road internationally (1958–63)===
{{story|date=August 2017}}
Eisenman left college and immediately took to the road (it was the time of [[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[On the Road]]'' published the previous year, 1957), but now not nationally, internationally. People who knew him then say he was the first to introduce American tennis shoes — substitutes for his college "white bucks" — as white walking shoes to Europe (see the picture at right)&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman sitting before the Parthenon, December, 1958. Statement is from Dieter Buhl, former Political Editor of ''Die Zeit''. See also ''The New Jerusalem'' back cover and p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first American "backpacker" they ever saw (Australians, New Zealanders, and assorted Europeans had been doing it earlier).&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', pp. 138, 399, and variously&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:eisenman greece.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|Photo: Eisenman before the Parthenon, December, 1958]]
Stopping in Paris, he spent the fall in [[Altaussee|Alt-Aussee]] in [[Austria]]; and from there to [[Vienna]] and down to [[Greece]], to [[Athens]] and ultimately [[Hydra Island]], where he was entertained by the Norwegian writer and poet [[Axel Jensen]] and his wife Marianne (later immortalized by [[Leonard Cohen]] in his song “[[So Long, Marianne]]”).

Having been accepted for graduate study in Comparative Literature at [[UC Berkeley]], Eisenman returned to the U.S. via [[Paris]] and [[Cape Cod]] and ultimately went across the country by [[Greyhound Bus]] to [[San Francisco]] where he found a room on [[Russian Hill]] and tested the scene at North Beach. When he finally went across the Bay to register at [[UC Berkeley]], what he saw reminded him so much of [[Cornell]] ([[Bermuda shorts]], [[bobby socks]], fraternities/sororities, etc. – this was a decade before the [[Free Speech Movement]] there) that he ripped up his [[computer punch card]]s right on the Registration line in the Armory and tossed them into a wastepaper basket.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Jerusalem'', p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

He then hitchhiked back across the country&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to Paris. From 1959 to 1960, Eisenman stayed at “the [[Beat Hotel]]” where he encountered the likes of [[William Burroughs]], [[Gregory Corso]], et al.,&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', pictures, pp. 242ff.&lt;/ref&gt; but he was not really interested in these sorts of persons or their scene. All this he documents in ''The New Jerusalem: A Millennium Poetic/Prophetic Travel Diario, 1959–62'',&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', pp. 7–17, 70–81, 294, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2007 and taken directly from the [[free verse]] notebooks he kept during this period, which he in his "Introduction" and his publishers on the back cover both call "an Anti-Beat Manifesto".&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', pp. xi–xiii and back cover description. For his anti-Beat sentiments and statements generally, see pp. 129, 321, 452, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

He then went on to [[Israel]] and [[Jerusalem]], where he had the epiphany of encountering members of his family of whom he had previously never heard (his great grandfather had gone to Jerusalem at the time of the Turks and was one of the founders of the [[Bikur Holim Hospital]] there, while his two oldest sons left him in [[Istanbul]] and came directly to America&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', p. 67; also see pp. 41–44, 112–16, etc. and obituary for Morris Eisenman, ''New York Times'', 1/20/1948, who came to U.S. in 1888, age 14, along with his older brother, Eisenman's grandfather, and was President and co-founder with David Sarnoff in 1897 of The Metropolitan News Company, an early Zionist, great philanthropist, patron of the arts, and close personal friend of Chaim Weizmann (cf. letter dated 7/10/1942, C.W. to M.E., St. Regis Hotel, NYC), helped found the ''Abendblatt'' Yiddush Newspaper, ''The Jewish Forward'', and Chaim Nahman Bialik and Shmaryahu Levin's ''Dvir'' Publishing Company in then Tel Aviv, Palestine, friend of Shalom Asch, and funded childhood "newsie" friend Samuel Roth's first U.S. publication attempt of James Joyce's ''Ulysses'' in 1927 and, through the Morris Eisenman Literary Fund, Yiddush writer Osip Dymow in 1942, the Second Avenue Yiddush Theater, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;), worked on [[Kibbutzim]] in the [[Galilee]] (1960–61 — he had previously worked on [[John F. Kennedy]]’s 1960 Campaign,&lt;ref&gt;See “America, I Call upon You,” ''The New Jerusalem'', pp. 49, 52–59, and 63–68&lt;/ref&gt;) and finally went back to join the first [[Peace Corps]] Group to go into the field. This, curiously enough, trained at the International House at [[UC Berkeley]], so he was back to where he had started out; but while they went on to meet Kennedy on the [[White House]] lawn and to [[Ghana]], he was flown back to [[New York City]] because, as he saw it, he was on his way to India and the East not Africa.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', pp. 98–104. Curiously this poem, “America, I Call upon You,” became something of "an anthem" for this group, ''ibid.'', pp. xi–xii&lt;/ref&gt;

Resuming his “Passage to India,” he returned to Paris, and then on to kibbutzim in the Galilee again.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', pp. 107–32&lt;/ref&gt; The next Spring, after staying in monasteries throughout Israel, and a climactic fight with the future Israeli “Peace Pilot” at the California Café in [[Tel Aviv]];&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'',  pp. 224–59&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenman made the last overland run from [[Cyprus]], across [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[Beluchistan]], and [[Pakistan]] by bus, train, and boat to [[India]], where he ended his journey as a guest of, and sleeping in, the Jewish Synagogue of [[New Delhi]],&lt;ref&gt;See ''The New Jerusalem'', pp. 344–446&lt;/ref&gt; most of whose members were up in the [[Simla Hill States]] because it was high summer and monsoon. He returned to Paris over the [[Indian Ocean]], up the [[Red Sea]], and across the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;See'' The New Jerusalem'', pp. 446–53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release of the Dead Sea Scrolls==
From  about 1986 onwards, Eisenman became the leading figure in the struggle to release and free the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]. The Scrolls had been discovered from 1948 to 1956 in several waves, but after a suggestive article by literary critic [[Edmund Wilson]] in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;“The Scrolls from the Dead Sea,” ''The New Yorker'', 5/14/55.&lt;/ref&gt; editing more or less ground to a halt from about 1959 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Baigent and Leigh, ''The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception'', London and New York, 1991, pp. 26–66; Eisenman, "The Desecration of the Scrolls," ''Midstream'', December, 1991, pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is not to say the Scrolls were not out. The Israelis had been very forthcoming with the first Scrolls that came into their possession from Cave I.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Asher Silberman, ''The Hidden Scrolls'', New York, 1994, pp. 39–67.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Scrolls from later caves discovered like III–XI, which came in after 1948 and Partition and on-site excavations by persons like Dominican Father [[Roland de Vaux]], which were the problem. In 1985–86, Eisenman, who had written his first book presenting, as he called it,  “A New Theory of Qumran Origins” in 1983&lt;ref&gt;See ''Maccabees, Zadokites, Christians and Qumran'', Leiden, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; and a follow-up on James as Righteous Teacher in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;''James the Just in the Habakkuk Pesher'', Leiden, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; received a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship at the Albright Institute of Archaeological Research in Jerusalem (also known as “the American School") where Cave I Scrolls had first come in and been photographed in 1947–48.&lt;ref&gt;See J. C. Trever, ''Scrolls from Qumran Cave 1'', Jerusalem, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ostensibly he was to work on a project comparing the Jerusalem Community of [[James the Just]] to the Community at [[Qumran]], but while at the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] (then the Albright Institute) he found that there was nothing he could do – all paths being barred to him. Notwithstanding, he and a colleague, [[Philip Davies]] of [[Sheffield University]], [[England]], went in to see one of the curators of the Shrine of the Book and were told categorically, “You will not see the Scrolls in your lifetime.”&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman, The Desecration of the Scrolls, ''Midstream'', December, 1991, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he came into possession of the complete computer print-out of all the Scrolls in possession of the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]], both those before 1967 and those afterwards at the [[Rockefeller Museum]] and, not three years later, a complete photographic archive of all previously unpublished materials from Cave IV all the way up to Cave XI.

He sent a copy of this computer-generated print-out to the Editor of ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'', [[Hershel Shanks]], which created a huge stir in the office and the campaign to free the Scrolls really began in earnest.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dead Seas Scrolls Deception'', pp. 73–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his stay at [[Oxford University]] as a senior fellow at the [[Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies]] and a visiting senior member of [[Linacre College]] in 1986–87, a colleague had also passed him a [[xerox]] copy of [[4QMMT]], a document which had been talked about but which no one outside the inner circle had ever been allowed to see. This, too, he freely shared with anyone who wanted to see it as part of the campaign,&lt;ref&gt;This included Prof. Davies, who fatefully shared it with Prof. Zdzslaw Kapera in Poland; see ''The Dead Seas Scrolls Deception,'' pp. 85–89.&lt;/ref&gt; and, thereafter, it made the rounds.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hidden Scrolls'', pp. 39–67 and 233–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, too, he brought [[James M. Robinson|James Robinson]] – a colleague of his at [[Claremont University]] and the Editor of the [[Nag Hammadi library|Nag Hammadi]] Codices (a dispute similar to the [[Qumran]] one)&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Robinson, ''The Nag Hammadi Library in English'', San Francisco, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; – into the mix and together they took the decision to publish all the unpublished photographs. This amounted to 1785 plates. The original  publication (in [[microfiche]] form) was supposed to occur in April, 1991 through [[EJ Brill]] in [[Leiden]], the [[Netherlands]].

However, a few weeks before publication, Brill's representative had attended a Scrolls Conference in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] and mistook the uproar there over Kapera’s publication the year before in [[Poland]] of the [[samizdat]] copy of [[4QMMT]] he had received from Davies for a dispute over freedom of access to the Scrolls generally. Following this, newly appointed Israeli representatives came to Leiden and talked the Brill publishers out of the Eisenman/Robinson [[microfiche]] project and into a newly conceived one of their own.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dead Sea Scrolls on Microfiche'', Leiden, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; So Eisenman and Robinson had to fall back on the offices of [[Hershel Shanks]] and the [[Biblical Archaeology Society]] who were unwilling to go to press before October/November of that year.&lt;ref&gt;''A Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', B.A.S., Washington D. C., 1991&lt;/ref&gt; The publication was contracted by public interest attorney [[William John Cox]].&lt;ref&gt;Silberman, Neil Asher, ''The Hidden Scrolls'', p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

While all these things were going on, Eisenman had been invited to become a consultant to the [[Huntington Library]] in [[San Marino]], [[California]], which had become aware that it had in its archive a collection of photographs of all the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], donated to it by [[Elizabeth Bechtel]]. The late [[William Andrew Moffett|William Moffett]], its director, asked whether he thought the library should open its archive to all scholars. He was projecting this for September, two months before Eisenman's and Robinson’s own projected B.A.S. Edition. Eisenman encouraged him to do so, though he knew the library would get most of the credit for breaking the monopoly and Robinson and he very little.&lt;ref&gt;See "The Riddle of the Scrolls", ''Vanity Fair'', November, 1992, pp. 224–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surveys, groundscans, and excavations==
Since 1988, Eisenman has led the Judean Desert Explorations/Excavations Project under the auspices of the Institute for the Study of Judeo-Christian Origins at [[CSULB]] he headed. These expeditions included students from CSULB and other institutions. Its aim was to search for possible new caves that might contain scrolls. It was his feeling that, though the [[Bedouin]]s in their enthusiasm to find artifacts had clearly been in almost all accessible caves, there might have been others, inaccessible to them or hidden in some manner or cave-ins. These were the best possibilities of finding new scrolls.

In the first expedition, between 1988 and 1989, he and his students were involved in the excavation of a cave a kilometer or two south of Qumran, in which they found some [[Bronze Age]] artifacts, including an arrow that had evidently been shot into the cave, which still displayed its [[lacquer]] rings and feather marks, an oil jug, and the wooden remains possibly of a [[plough]].

From 1989 to 1992 Eisenman and his students conducted a walking survey of the entire [[Dead Sea]] shore and its environs from seven kilometers north of Qumran to thirty-five kilometers south, past [[Wadi Murabba'at]], to the northern limits of [[Ein Gedi]], mapping the whole area. In this survey they went into some 485 caves and depressions.&lt;ref&gt;“The 1988–92 California State University Dead Sea Walking Cave Survey and Radar Groundscan of the Qumran Cliffs,” ''The Quman Chronicle'', 9/2-4, December, 2000, p. 125; also see “The British had it all Wrong when Naming the Dead Sea,” Nick Tatro, AP, 2/2/90&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990–91, with the help of author [[Michael Baigent]]&lt;ref&gt;''Holy Blood, Holy Grail'', London and New York, 1982 and ''The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception'', London and New York, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[radar]] groundscan specialist Tony Wood, he conducted the first radar groundscan of the Qumran plateau, its ruins and, in particular, the top of the various [[marls]], including Caves 4–6 where he felt there was the best chance of finding hidden pockets that previously might not have been visible. Ground-scanning on the marls and below Cave VI did point to several such pockets and seemingly empty areas in the marls adjourning Cave IV.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Baigent and Robert Eisenman, “A Ground-Penetrating Radar Survey at Khirbat Qumran,” ''The Quman Chronicle'', 9/2-4, December, 2000, pp. 131–38&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:eisenman cave4.jpeg|right|thumb|300px|Photo: Prof. Eisenman on first Qumran Radar Ground-scan Expedition standing in face of Cave 4, 1990–91]]
In 2001–03, his teams joined an expedition led by Hanan Eshel and Magen Broshi and sponsored by John Merrill and the B.A.S. In the course of this expedition, two of his students, Dennis Walker and Ron Dubay, excavated a small building on the eastern edge of the Qumran Cemetery. They found that it contained bones: two secondary burials (and the next year one primary burial was uncovered beneath this).&lt;ref&gt;"Bones of Contention," ''Time Magazine'' 8/6/01, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year everyone went back to do more work on the enclosure and the bones it contained and to further survey the graveyard at Qumran, which evolved into the first comprehensive map of the Qumran settlement and adjacent cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;M. Broshi and H. Eshel, "Three Seasons of Excavations at Qumran," ''Journal of Roman Archaeology'', 17/1, 2004, pp. 321–332.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, they had the opportunity to return and investigate the empty areas in the marls of Cave IV, but with little result.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Kurtus, ''Investigating History: The Dead Sea Scrolls'', May, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenman claims that the preconceptions of the group of scholars around Father [[Roland De Vaux]] who first worked on the Dead Sea Scrolls led them to erroneously date the non-biblical, sectarian community documents to the [[Maccabean]] period, and to read them as the writings of a serene, retiring community of [[Essene]] [[monks]] exiled to the wilderness in the course of a dispute with the reigning priesthood of the day led by the "Wicked Priest"/"Spouter of Lying."&lt;ref&gt;See F. M. Cross, ''The Ancient Library of Qumran'', New York, 1961 and Eisenman, ''The New Testament Code'', pp. 3–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eisenman reads the attitude of these documents as militant, nationalistic and zealous and places them not in the Maccabean period but the later, [[Herodian Dynasty|Herodian]] era (c. 35 BCE to 70 CE and beyond), which means the establishment priesthood that they opposed was the collaborating, compromising, corrupt Herodian priesthood. He sees parallels between the political, religious and ethical stance of these sectarian documents and that of [[James the brother of Jesus]], whom he identifies as the scrolls' [[Teacher of Righteousness]], and sees 'the [[Wicked Priest]]' and 'the Man of Lying' as two different adversaries of the scroll community, the Wicked Priest being the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] [[Ananus ben Ananus]], James' executioner, and the Man of Lying, [[St. Paul]].

He is critical of the ways [[radiocarbon dating]]  and [[paleography]] have been employed to date the Dead Sea Scrolls, and relies instead on his interpretation of the content of the scrolls despite this being at a clash with scientific consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Glenn. "Good Question......how well-respected are the theories of Eisenman, Allegro, Thiering, and Baigent &amp; Leigh concerning the Dead Sea Scrolls?" http://christianthinktank.com/iceman.html 12.April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He claims to find parallels between the James-[[Jesus]] first century milieu and the scrolls' repeated allusion to "the Star Prophecy", the aggressiveness of the [[War Scroll]] and similar documents, the hiding of the [[Jerusalem]] Temple treasure as delineated in the [[Copper Scroll]],&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament Code''&lt;/ref&gt; the description of foreign armies (the ''[[Kittim]]'') invading on a much more massive scale than any [[Hellenistic]] invasion during the Maccabean period,&lt;ref&gt;''Maccabees, Zadokites, Christians and Qumran'', Leiden, 1984, pp. 24, 70, and 80 and ''James the Just in the Habakkuk Pesher'', Leiden, 1986, pp. 14–30 and 75–78.&lt;/ref&gt; and the reference to themselves several times as "the Congregation," "Church of the Poor" and [[Ebionites]] (“the Poor”), the name of James’ community as described in Early Church literature and by Paul.&lt;ref&gt;4QpPs 37ii.11 and iii.10&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenman lays particular emphasis on the scroll community's description of the Kittim's military and religious practices in their interpretation of [[Habakkuk]] 2:2–2:4 (the [[Habakkuk Commentary]]) as "sacrificing to their standards and worshiping their weapons of War", and their reference to [[Roman Empire|Roman]] “[[tax-farming]]” across the whole of the civilized world.&lt;ref&gt;''James the Just in the Habakkuk Pesher'', pp. 21–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interpretation of Habakkuk 2:4 at Qumran====
The recourse to an interpretation of Habakkuk 2:4 (“the Righteous shall live by his Faith”), the center piece and real building block of all [[Christian theology]] both in the Pauline corpus ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]], [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]], ''et al''.) and in the [[Epistle of James]] he sees as proof positive that these documents were written more or less contemporaneously and at a time when this [[prophecy]] or [[proof-text]] was in play.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament Code'', pp. 51–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, he sees the interpretation in the [[Habakkuk Commentary]] at Qumran, seemingly written in the latter part of the Community’s history and witnessing its fall and the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|fall of the Jerusalem Temple]] (c. 70 CE), as ‘Jamesian’ as opposed to ‘Pauline’.&lt;ref&gt;''James the Just in the Habakkuk Pesher'', Leiden, 1996, pp. vii–x, 32–42, and 99&lt;/ref&gt; That is, first of all it is confined to “Jews” or, in the language of the Commentary, “the House of Judah,” and second of all, it applies only to “Torah-doing” Jews (“doing” here, the basis of the [[Hebrew]] word for “works” throughout the Qumran corpus and also being an extremely important usage in the Epistle of James), that is, it does not apply to “non-Torah-doing Jews” and certainly not "non-Torah-doing Gentiles."&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid''.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Eisenman this is a direct riposte and a rejection of the Pauline interpretation of this prophecy, and the basis of the [[Pauline theology]] one finds in Galatians and Romans and actually, in fact, seemingly argued against in the extant Epistle of James whether seen as authentic, not authentic, or just part of ‘the Jamesian School’; and, therefore, Eisenman claims, a chronological indicator for the document as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament Code'', pp. 551–638 and 848–938.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, he points to the fact that there are even collections of messianic proof-texts at Qumran which include, for instance, the [[Star Prophecy]] of [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 24:17 which [[Josephus]], at the end of the [[The Wars of the Jews|Jewish War]], singles out as the reason for the outbreak of the revolt, and even one dedicated to “the Promises to the Seed” or “House of David.”&lt;ref&gt;4QTest i.9–13 and 4QFlor i.7–14.&lt;/ref&gt; For Eisenman the Dead Sea Scrolls are [[Jewish messianism|Messianic]], it being not properly appreciated just how messianic the Scrolls actually are. They represent "the literature of the Messianic Movement in Palestine" which he prefers to the usage “Christianity in Palestine".

Though, one might call them “[[Essene]]”, one must take the definition for this from what the Scrolls themselves say, not necessarily what others think or say the Essenes were. [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], for instance, possibly preserving an alternate version of Josephus, thinks there are two or even three groups of “Essenes”, “[[Zealot]]” or “[[Sicarii]] Essenes”, and for Eisenman, this is a better definition of what the Essenes were than the more normative ones people are familiar with.&lt;ref&gt;Hippolytus, ''Refutation of All Heresies'', 9,14–9.22 and ''The New Testament Code'', pp. 939–97.&lt;/ref&gt; For him the Essenes are what Christians were in Palestine before ‘the Movement’ went overseas and was Paulinized, turning it into the mirror opposite of what it was in Palestine before the fall of the Temple.

For him, [[Acts]] confirms this, averring that “Christians were first called Christians” in [[Antioch]] in [[Syria]] in the mid-Fifties AD.&lt;ref&gt;Acts 11:26.&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to this, he considers the more historically-oriented sectarian or later documents of the Dead Sea Scrolls to be the messianically inspired literature of a pietist, Law-oriented, and nationalistic Party in opposition to [[Roman Empire|Roman]]/[[Herodian Dynasty|Herodian]] rule in Palestine which uses the language as “Sons of [[Zadok]]” (in some vocabularies, “[[Sadducees]]”) or “''[[Zaddikim]]'' (צדיקים),” a derivate usage, in referring to itself or even “Messianic Sadducees”, as opposed to “Herodian Sadducees” pictured in both the [[New Testament]] and Josephus.

====Call for AMS carbon dating====
{{rewrite section|date=April 2013}}
With his attempts to get free access to the Scrolls, Eisenman claims he was the first to call for AMS [[Carbon dating the Dead Sea Scrolls]]&lt;ref&gt;Cf. M. Baigent and R. Leigh, ''The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception'', London/New York, 1991, pp. 80–83.&lt;/ref&gt; (the earliest carbon dating tests – non-AMS – were performed November 14, 1950 on a piece of linen from Qumran Cave 1, producing a date range being 167&amp;nbsp;BCE – 233&amp;nbsp;CE.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authors=VanderKam, James C. &amp; Flint, Peter|title=The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|location=New York|year=2002|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libby had first started using the dating method in 1946 and early testing required relatively large samples that were destroyed, so testing on scrolls only became feasible when methods used in the dating process were improved upon.&lt;ref&gt;Doudna, G. "Carbon-14 Dating", in ''Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls'', Schiffman, Lawrence, &amp; VanderKam, James, eds., Vol.1 (Oxford: 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; [[F. E. Zeuner]] carried out tests on date palm wood from the Qumran site yielding a date range of 70&amp;nbsp;BCE – 90&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authors=VanderKam, James C. &amp; Flint, Peter|title=The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco|location=New York|year=2002|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 Libby tested a sample from the Isaiah Scroll, which gave a range between 200&amp;nbsp;BCE – 1&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;Carmi, Israel, "Radiocarbon Dating of the Dead Sea Scrolls" in ''The Dead Sea Scrolls: Fifty Years after their Discovery. 1947–1997'', Schiffman, Lawrence, Tov, Emanuel, &amp; VanderKam, James, eds., (Jerusalem: IES, 2000) p.881.&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal was contained in a series of letters to [[John Strugnell]], Eisenman wrote with [[Philip R. Davies]] of [[Sheffield University]] in [[England]] and copied to [[Amir Drori]], the head of the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;Baigent and Leigh, ''Ibid''., 5/2/89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not two months after he and Davies made this request to the Antiquities Authority, to which they attached a recent article about AMS [[radiocarbon]] techniques, it announced its intention to run just such tests. Eisenman was not mentioned as having initiated the tests. He and Davies had included in their letter to the IAA a caveat, that "Opposition Scholars" be included in process because they claimed it was they who felt the most need for the tests and they who could identify which documents should be tested.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament Code'', pp. 44–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Eisenman and Davies were not included in the testing process. Eisenman disputes the findings of these tests.&lt;ref&gt;See Atwill, Braunheim, and Eisenman, Redating the Radio-Carbon Dating of the Dead Sea Scrolls, ''Dead Sea Discoveries'', 11/2/04, pp. 143–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

===James===
{{Main|James the Brother of Jesus (book)}}
As far as Eisenman is concerned, [[James the Just]], the individual [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] actually refers to as either  "brother of Jesus" or “the brother of the Lord,”&lt;ref&gt;''James the Brother of Jesus'', Penguin, 1997–98, pp. 51–153 and 647–816.&lt;/ref&gt; is the historical character who exhibits the most in common with “the [[Teacher of Righteousness]]" pictured at Qumran and he considers that these events are the ones vividly portrayed in the Habakkuk Commentary. Historically speaking, it is this character who led the “Opposition Movement,” including Essenes, [[Zealots]], [[Sicarii]], and/or [[Nazoreans]] — even [[Ebionites]] — and who, as “[[Zaddik]]" (צדיק), i. e., “the ''Zaddik'' of the Opposition Movement,” about whom all these groups revolved until his death at the hands of the [[High Priest]] [[Ananus ben Ananus]] in 62 CE as described both in Josephus and Early Church literature.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'' and Josephus, ''Antiquities'' 20.200 and Eusebius, ''Ecclesiastical History'' 2.23 and 4.22&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the popularity of James and the illegality of the manner of his death at the hands of the Herodians, establishment High Priesthood, and [[Pharisees]] in 62 CE set the stage for and possibly even triggered the [[First Jewish Revolt]] against the [[Rome]] in 66–73 CE — to say nothing of the fire in [[Rome]], not long afterwards which, aside from his probably having set it himself,{{dubious|date=September 2012}}{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[Nero]] was reported to have blamed on “Christians.”

For his part, the Jewish historian Josephus makes it clear that those he is calling “Essenes” (as opposed to these same [[Herodian Dynasty|Herodians]], [[Sadducees]], and [[Pharisees]]) participated in the uprising, willing to undergo any torture or any form of death rather than "eat things sacrificed to idols" or "break the Law."&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''War'' 2.151–3 and Hippolytus, ''Refutation'', 9.21&lt;/ref&gt; For Eisenman, these “[[Nazoreans]],” (נצרים) “[[Zealots]],” (קנאים) “''Zaddikim''” (צדיקים) or “''[[Ebionim]]''” (אביונים)  were marginalized by a Herodian named Saul ([[Paul of Tarsus]]) and the gentile Christians who followed him. This version of [[Christianity]], as it later emerged from a gentile milieu as led by Paul, transformed the apocalyptic militancy of the [[Ebionite]]/Essene ''Zaddikim'' into a universalist peaceful doctrine. In this manner, Eisenman sees the doctrine of [[Christianity]] as largely the product of Pauline [[dialectic]] and [[apologetics]]. In so doing, Eisenman attempts to recover the authentic teaching of Jesus and/or James from the obscurity into which it seems to have been intentionally cast by resultant orthodoxy. As he puts it at the end of ''James the Brother of Jesus'', once you have found the Historical James, you have found the [[Historical Jesus]] or alternatively, “who and whatever James was so too was Jesus”.&lt;ref&gt;''James the Brother of Jesus'', Penguin, 1998, p. 963.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paul as a Herodian===
Eisenman identifies [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] as a [[Herodians|Herodian]], calling attention to [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Paul's peculiar version of Judaism]]. A presentation seeming to represent the interests of the Herodian dynasty in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], as well as the intention to extend its influence into [[Asia Minor]] and further East into Northern [[Syria]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. He covered this in a series of papers and books beginning in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;''Maccabees, Zadokites, Christians and Qumran'', E. J. Brill, 1984, pp. 62–3 and 90–1 and “Paul as Herodian,” SBL, 1984, published in ''Journal of Higher Criticism'', iii, 1996, pp. 110–22 and ''The Dead Sea Scrolls and the First Christians'', 1996, pp. 226–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Offered as proof is Paul’s salutation (if authentic), at the end of the [[Letter to the Romans]], where he sends greetings to his “kinsman Herodion” (i. e., “the Littlest Herod”) and “all those in the Household of [[Aristobulus of Chalcis|Aristobulus]]” (the putative son of [[Herod of Chalcis]] and the ultimate husband of the infamous [[Salome]] – in fact, their son was “the Littlest Herod”).&lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament Code'', pp. 500–7 and cf. Romans 16:10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proof is also found in Josephus’ picture of a curious member of the Herodian family, an individual he also calls “Saulos” who shares many characteristics in common with “Paul” in [[New Testament]] portraiture. Not only was this “Saulos” involved in an appeal of sorts to “[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]],” he was also involved in violent behaviour in Jerusalem (although on the surface, at a somewhat later time); and it was he who made the final report to [[Nero]] in [[Corinth]] about the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Roman reverses in Jerusalem]] which resulted in the dispatch of his best general [[Vespasian]] from [[Great Britain|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''The Jewish War'' 2.418, 556–58, and ''The Antiquities'', 20.214.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally he found Herodian traces in Paul’s own outlook, his philosophy of “winning“ or being a “Jew to the Jews, a Law-keeper to the Law-keeper and a Law-breaker to the Law-breaker” also expressed in [[I Corinthians]] 9:19–27. In his own identification of himself as of “the [[Tribe of Benjamin]]” ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 11:1 and [[Philippians]] 3:5), a claim he might have felt Herodians, as [[Edomites|Idumeans]], were making for themselves, and his founding “a Community where [[Greeks]] and Jews could live in harmony, etc.,” where there were “no foreign visitors,” as well as in the easy access he seems to have had to positions of power, and his own Roman citizenship.

Rounding out his arguments, Eisenman cites the matter of an unidentified “nephew” of Paul—seemingly the son of Paul’s sister, resident in Jerusalem (Cypros married to the Temple Treasurer Helcias? – see the genealogies &lt;ref&gt;''The New Testament Code'', pp. 1010–11 and ''James the Brother of Jesus'', pp. 968–69.&lt;/ref&gt;). This “nephew” has unfettered entrée to the Commander of the Roman [[garrison]] in the [[Tower of Antonia]] who, in turn, saves Paul from “[[Nazirite]] oath-taking” “[[Zealot]]”-like Jewish extremists who take an oath “not to eat or drink till they have killed Paul” (Acts 23:12–35). Eisenman identifies this individual as Julius Archelaus, the son of Saulos’ sister, Cypros. Finally, consider Paul's Roman citizenship; the philosophy of paying the Roman tax to Caesar; and placing the [[Roman Law]] above the [[Jewish Law]] as an expression of “the Righteousness Commandment” of [[Great Commandment|“loving your neighbor as yourself”]] (Romans 13:1–10).

===First to call the James Ossuary fraudulent===
Eisenman was the first to publicly claim that the [[James Ossuary]] was fraudulent when it originally surfaced in October, 2002 and he did this on the first day it appeared in news articles from [[Associated Press|AP]] and op-ed pieces as in the [[Los Angeles Times]]&lt;ref&gt;”A Discovery That’s Just too Perfect,” Los Angeles Times, October 29th, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of what the inscription actually said and not on the basis of ‘scientific’ or ‘pseudo-scientific aids like those of [[palaeography]] or [[patina]] analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenman, ''The New Testament Code'', London/New York, 2006, pp. 56–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first place, when he actually saw the [[ossuary]] at the AAR/[[Society of Biblical Literature|SBL]] Conference in [[Toronto]] three weeks later, it was clear there were two separate hands on the [[inscription]], the second patently more cursive. Secondly, even if the “Jacob the Son of Joseph” part were authentic (there being plenty of ossuaries of this kind available around Jerusalem), the second “Brother of Jesus” part would have to have been added a substantial amount of time later, either in antiquity by a pious pilgrim or in modern times, by a not-very-sophisticated forger because at the time (62 CE), Jesus – if he existed as such — would have been no more well known in Jerusalem than his putative brother James, and probably far less so; so there would have been no need to add such a rare [[cognomen]] except to please believers.

Moreover, as he said in his [[Los Angeles Times]] op ed of 10/29/02, he would have been much more impressed if the first part of the [[inscription]] had said “son of Clopas’/‘Cleophas’/‘[[Saint Peter|Cephas]]’ or some such thing, which is how individuals connected to this family were known in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in this period and not the more pat or theologically-consistent “Joseph”; or if the second part had simply added the cognomen “the ''Zaddik''” (הׂצדיק) or “Just One,” which was also how James was known by everyone in Palestine at this time according to [[Eusebius]].&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius quoting Hegesippus, ''Ecclesiastical History'', 2.23.4–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Scientology''''' is a compilation book about the [[Church of Scientology]] and the [[new religious movement]] [[Scientology]], edited by [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]]. It was published in March 2009 by [[Oxford University Press]]. In addition to Lewis, other contributors to the book include [[J. Gordon Melton]], [[William Sims Bainbridge]], [[Douglas E. Cowan]], [[David G. Bromley]], [[Anson Shupe]], [[James T. Richardson]], and [[Susan J. Palmer]]. ''Scientology'' gives an overview and introduction to the organization, and presents an analysis of the movement from the perspective of [[sociology]]. The book compares the organization to other religious movements, and goes over its history of controversy. It delves into the practices of the organization and activities of its missions.

''Scientology'' was given an unfavorable review in the ''International Journal of Cultic Studies'', which considered the book unduly biased in Scientology's favour, a view echoed in a review in satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''.&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; It received a positive review in ''Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review'', describing it as "the most sophisticated academic item published on Scientology" to date, a book to be read by journalists and academics alike, and "the most important collection of scholarly articles on Scientology published so far – in any language".&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;

==Editor==
At the time of the book's publication, James R. Lewis was employed as a lecturer in the subject of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Oxford University Press | title =  Scientology - About the Author| work =  OUP USA  | publisher = www.oup.com | year =  2009| url = http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/ReligionTheology/SociologyofReligion/?view=usa&amp;ci=9780195331493 | accessdate =2010-01-29  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part covers "Theoretical and Quantitative Approaches", examining Scientology's [[soteriology]] as well as the degree to which Scientology can be said to be growing. The third part focuses on the "Community and Practices" of Scientology, while the fourth part, "Sources and Comparative Approaches", examines Scientology's religious claims. Part V is focused on "Controversy", such as Scientology's battles with the [[anti-cult movement]] and court cases in different countries concerning Scientology's recognition or lack of recognition as a religion. The sixth part analyzes the organization's activities in its "International Missions", while the seventh examines "Dimensions of Scientology", including a chapter on the [[Xenu]] myth.

Various chapters comment on Scientology's growth. Lewis puts forth the assertion that the religion is growing at a "healthy—but not a spectacular—rate" (22 percent over the period from 1990 to 2001, from 45,000 to 55,000 according to an American survey of religious self-identification), and states that contrary to the Church's own claims, it is "clearly not the world's fastest growing".&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; William Sims Bainbridge, a [[sociologist]], asserts that Scientology has experienced growth along the [[West Coast of the United States]].&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; Bainbridge looked at statistical data on the percentage of websites managed by Scientologists, and his studies revealed that the most significant portion was in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and the state of [[California]].&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; According to Bainbridge, the experience of Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] in [[science fiction]] writing combined with the Church of Scientology's skill with the "emerging cyberculture" might lead to ways that the organization can change in a future that further utilizes technology.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; In a section of the book on dealings of the organization in [[Denmark]], researchers found that there was a decrease in the number of people joining the organization, and that the number of dedicated Scientologists in the country remained steady for the past two decades.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; [[University of Copenhagen]] researchers Rie Wallendorf and Peter B. Andersen write that the Church of Scientology in Denmark is wary of those external to the organization, and that this detracts from the likelihood that new members will join.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt;

[[Charles de Gaulle University – Lille III|Charles De Gaulle University]] researcher [[Régis Dericquebourg]] writes that when compared to the Scientology practice of "[[Auditing (Scientology)|Auditing]]", other ceremonies carried out by the organization have more restricted levels of participation.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; According to Dericquebourg, these Scientology ceremonies include social functions which are frequented mainly by "elite members".&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; [[University Bordeaux Montaigne|University Michel de Montaigne]] researcher Bernardette Rigal-Cellard investigated the various Scientology missions and determined that these missions operated with a United States-based type of methodology.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; This form of organizational structure and operational tactics is seen as not working well in areas where the U.S. is not seen favorably, including sections of [[Western Europe]], but agreeable to locations sympathetic to American culture.&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt;

===Reviews in scholarly journals===

====Review by Terra Manca====
''Scientology'' was given a negative review by Terra Manca writing in the ''International Journal of Cultic Studies'', the journal of the [[International Cultic Studies Association]].&lt;ref name="manca"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manca|first=Terra|title=Book Review: Scientology by James R. Lewis (editor)|journal=International Journal of Cultic Studies|date=November 1, 2010|url=http://www.icsahome.com/articles/book-review-scientology-ijcs-2010|accessdate=2010-11-17|volume=1|issue=1|publisher=[[International Cultic Studies Association]]|pages=90–96|oclc=608305709|location=[[Bonita Springs, Florida]]|issn=2154-7270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manca wrote, "it is most likely to please persons who take an uncritical view of Scientology."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Of the lack of standards of research utilized in the book, the review stated, "far too many contributors in this volume fail to critically assess the data that they gather, thereby falling short of providing evidence that has undergone rigorous academic inquiry. Without rigor or critical assessment, a book such as this one (about a supposed new religious movement [NRM]) risks becoming pro-NRM propaganda."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Manca's review put forth the argument, "although this book brings needed academic attention to Scientology, its shortfalls are substantial enough to render it as an unreliable source of information about the organization."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt;

{{quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right |halig=left | salign=right|quote="... although this book brings needed academic attention to Scientology, its shortfalls are substantial enough to render it as an unreliable source of information about the organization."|source=&amp;nbsp;—''International Journal of Cultic Studies''&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt;}}
Manca criticized the book for failing to include substantive analysis of several aspects within the controversial history of the Scientology organization, including its treatment in countries Germany and [[Belgium]]; lack of discussion regarding Scientology programs including [[Narconon]], [[Criminon]], [[World Literacy Crusade]], and [[Applied Scholastics]]; dearth of coverage regarding use within the organization of the [[Suppressive Person]] [[jargon]] and related practice of [[Disconnection]]; scarcity of commentary on the successor to the organization's [[intelligence agency]] [[Guardian's Office]] with the [[Office of Special Affairs]], and failure to cite critical scholarship on the subject matter.&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Manca noted that aside from simply neglecting to utilize key academic scholarship on the topic, the authors of chapters within ''Scientology'' also failed to seriously analyze material received from primary-sources including Scientology organization representatives.&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; The review asserted, "This lack of critical inquiry leads to some conclusions that appear biased, involves the use of polarized language, and significantly diminishes the quality of information that might have challenged Scientology's claims regarding itself and its founder."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; The review criticized ''Scientology'' for the fact that two contributors had added a reference to [[Wikipedia]] to their essays – "citing questionable sources can produce questionable results, which in turn can discredit the value of academic research".&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Manca questioned the judgement of the book's publisher for allowing this type of writing practice, "It is surprising that editors at Oxford University Press allow Wikipedia to stand as an appropriate scholarly source in this or any volume."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt;

The ''International Journal of Cultic Studies'' book review observed that the researchers were not removed in expressed point-of-view from the topic they wrote about, "Despite Lewis's claims, he and many of his contributors fail to remain neutral".&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Manca did not recommend the book for research on the Scientology organization, "Because of its numerous and varied shortcomings, this new book on Scientology is a poor sourcebook on the organization."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; Manca wrote that due to the poor quality of the work, the book itself could be cited as an example of problematic research, "Oddly enough, because of its numerous shortfalls and biases, ''Scientology'' may be useful to anyone who is studying the pro-cult/counter-cult debate and who wants to see numerous examples of biased scholarship by apparently polarized researchers."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt; The review concluded, "As a reference for inquiry into Scientology, however, this book fails on many fronts."&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt;

====Review by Marco Frenschkowski====
{{quote box |width=25em | bgcolor=#c6dbf7 |align=right |halig=left | salign=right|quote="... the most sophisticated academic item published on Scientology so far [...] a serious attempt at bringing together what different fields of cultural studies (not just religious studies) can say about the most controversial of NRMs."|source=&amp;nbsp;—''Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review''&lt;ref name="manca" /&gt;}}
A 30-page review by the German [[Protestant]] [[theologian]] and [[history of religion]] scholar Marco Frenschkowski in ''Alternative Spirituality and Religion Review'' stated that the book "simply put is the most
sophisticated academic item published on Scientology so far", adding that "this does not mean it will not be controversial, or that every statement in the book holds up to scrutiny."&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski&gt;{{Cite journal

Frenschkowski lauded Lewis's introduction, in which Lewis notes scholars' reluctance to publish Scientology research, given the organization's reputation as "a litigious organization, ready to sue anyone who dares criticize the Church", and addresses Scientologists' tendency to misunderstand the nature of the academic process.&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt; Frenschkowski described Melton's chapter as finding "a fine balance between critical observations and giving due weight to the point of view of devoted Scientologists [...] This does not mean defending Scientology: it means taking both members and critics seriously."&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;

Frenschkowski welcomed Rothstein's chapter on the [[Xenu]] myth as an "important study", stating that it "defines a very good starting point for further research".&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt; He commented that Rothstein was right to praise "the anonymous Wikipedia article on the subject", a fact that was reflective of "the deeply unsatisfying state of affairs" that to date there had been not a single peer-reviewed journal article covering the topic.&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt; However, he wished Rothstein had contextualized the myth more with Hubbard's other [[space opera]] writings, and the [[science fiction]] field in general, and suggested more work needed to be done on this.&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;

Frenschkowski listed some minor errors in the anthology, said he regretted the absence of a glossary, and was critical of the fact that there were several overlaps between various chapters; however, his main point of criticism was that apart from some new data based on the quantitative sociological approach, the book mainly presented overviews of data already known, stating that "this does not diminish the value of this fine collection, but the next academic publications on Scientology should not be once again overviews but monographs on special questions", "more specialized, in-depth studies on concepts, ideas and practices working with new data".&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;

Towards the end of his review, Frenschkowski recalls the editor's prediction, made in the introduction, that the book would "likely end up pleasing no one engaged in the Scientology/anti-Scientology conflict, which is perhaps as it should be".&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt; Summing up, Frenschkowski states that the book pleased him, at any rate, and that he wished for it to be "read not just by academics but also e.g. by journalists [...]. It is the most important collection of articles on Scientology published so far – in any language."&lt;ref name=Frenschkowski /&gt;

===Other reviews===
The book received a critical analysis in the British [[satire|satirical]] and current affairs [[magazine]] ''[[Private Eye]]''.&lt;ref name="hislop"&gt;{{cite journal|editor-last=Hislop|editor-first=Ian|title=Literary Review: Cult cock - OUP|journal=[[Private Eye]]|volume=|issue=|page=16|publisher= Pressdram Ltd|location = | date = April 17, 2009| url = | doi = |issn=0032-888X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The review criticized the book for its unusually sympathetic tone and for not mentioning numerous notable controversies surrounding Scientology.&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; ''Private Eye'' was critical of the book's presentation of asserted facts regarding the life of Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]], as given in two separate instances in the book by contributors [[J. Gordon Melton]] and [[David G. Bromley]].&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; Melton stated his contribution gave, "an overview of the life of L. Ron Hubbard anchored by the general agreed facts",&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; and Bromley asserted, "Although the basic outline of L. Ron Hubbard's life is not contested, the LRH persona has been a subject of particularly intense debate. Church critics have charged that many of the claims that Hubbard made about his own life and accomplishments are empirically false."&lt;ref name="lewis" /&gt; The ''Private Eye'' review called this notion "poppycock", writing, "Everything about Scientology's founder is contested, though no one reading this book would realise that."&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; As an example of disputed material about Hubbard's life, the review contrasted assertions by Melton about the [[military career of L. Ron Hubbard]] with documented [[United States Navy]] records cited by author [[Russell Miller]] in the [[biography]], ''[[Bare-Faced Messiah]]''.&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt;

The ''Private Eye'' review concluded by criticizing [[Oxford University Press]] for publishing the book: "What is utterly mystifying is why one of the oldest and most respected publishing houses in the world chooses to give its imprimatur to this tendentious drivel."&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; When questioned by ''Private Eye'', a spokesman for Oxford University Press responded, "Certainly this book was peer-reviewed."&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt; ''Private Eye'' joked that the [[peer review]]ers of the book may have been controversial figures [[Jeffrey Archer|Lord Archer]] and [[Conrad Black|Lord Black]].&lt;ref name="hislop" /&gt;

Richard Cimino, founder and editor of the Religioscope Institute-published newsletter ''Religion Watch'', wrote that the book "focuses less on the church's abuses than on its organizational dynamics and teachings, although its authors do broach controversial issues."&lt;ref name="cimino"&gt;{{cite news| last =Cimino  | first =  Richard | title =Analysis: the rise or the fall of Scientology?  | work =Religioscope | publisher = religion.info | date = July 30, 2009 | url = http://religion.info/english/articles/article_433.shtml | accessdate = 2010-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cimino commented that the book is "divided about whether the movement and its distinctive blend of science, psychotherapy and esoteric religion is growing".&lt;ref name="cimino" /&gt; In an article about Scientology by B.A. Robinson at the website of the organization [[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]], ''Scientology'' is listed as a "recommended book".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Robinson | first = B.A. | title = About the Church of Scientology - A religion founded by L.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the purpose of making substantive reforms to the [[United States]] [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] by rewriting its [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].

==Background==
Since the initial 1787–88 debate over ratification of the Constitution, there have been sporadic calls for the convening of a second convention to modify and correct perceived shortcomings in the Federal system it established. [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article V]] of the Constitution provides two methods for amending the nation’s frame of government. The first method authorizes Congress, "whenever two-thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary" (a two-thirds of those members present—assuming that a [[quorum]] exists at the time that the vote is cast—and not necessarily a two-thirds vote of the entire membership elected and serving in the two houses of Congress), to propose Constitutional amendments. The second method requires Congress, "on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several states" (presently 34), to "call a convention for proposing amendments".&lt;ref name=A5convetion&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42589.pdf|title=The Article V Convention to Propose Constitutional Amendments: Contemporary Issues for Congress|last=Neale|first=Thomas H.|date=April 11, 2014|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|pages=1–2|accessdate=November 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Alexander Hehmeyer, a lawyer for [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]-based Marshall Field's department store as well as [[Time Inc.]], wrote ''A Time for Change'' (Farrar &amp; Rinehart), in which he proposed a second Constitutional Convention to streamline the Federal Government.&lt;ref name=twsNovW23&gt;{{cite news |author= Marvine Howe |title= Alexander Hehmeyer, 82, Lawyer For the Family of Marshall Field |publisher= ''[[The New York Times]]''|date= February 24, 1993 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/24/us/alexander-hehmeyer-82-lawyer-for-the-family-of-marshall-field.html |accessdate= December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s, [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Everett Dirksen]] called for a constitutional convention by appealing to state legislatures to summon one.&lt;ref name=twsNovW12&gt;{{cite news |title= The Constitution: Ev's Amendment |publisher= ''Time Magazine'' |date= Aug 8, 1969 |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941274,00.html |accessdate= December 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three times in the 20th century, concerted efforts were undertaken by proponents of particular issues to secure the number of applications necessary to summon an Article V Convention. These included conventions to consider amendments to (1) provide for popular election of U.S. Senators; (2) permit the states to include factors other than equality of population in drawing state legislative [[Electoral district|district]] boundaries; and (3) to propose an [[Balanced budget amendment|amendment]] requiring the U.S. budget to be balanced under most circumstances. The campaign for a popularly elected Senate is frequently credited with "prodding" the Senate to join the House of Representatives in proposing what became the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth Amendment]] to the states in 1912,&lt;ref&gt;Lessig (2011, pp. 292–3).{{full|date=March 2017}}{{verification needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full|date=March 2017}}{{verification needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;!--THIS SEEMS AN EXTERNAL CUT AND PASTE REFERENCE; THERE IS NO LESSING BOOK CITED.--&gt; while the latter two campaigns came very close to meeting the two-thirds threshold in the 1960s and 1980s, respectively.&lt;ref name=A5convetion/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rossum|first1=Ralph A.|title=Federalism, the Supreme Court, and the Seventeenth Amendment: The Irony of Constitutional Democracy|date=2001|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-0-7391-0285-5|page=207|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6roqr31guvUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=convention%20&amp;f=false|accessdate=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsNovW14/&gt; In 2013, the number of states calling for a convention to consider a balanced budget amendment was believed to be either 33 or 20,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Higgs, Northeast Ohio Media Group, November 25, 2013, [http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2013/11/kasich_house_and_senate_leader_1.html House and Senate leaders to tout need for balanced budget amendment to U.S. Constitution], Accessed Dec. 29, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and the tally may depend on rulings about whether past state applications have been rescinded. In 1983, [[State of Missouri|Missouri]] applied;&lt;ref&gt;Terry Ganey, January 23, 2010, Columbia Daily Tribune, [http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/politics/legislators-push-balanced-budget/article_bc5a3d41-f014-5ae3-9399-3d09bd47bd6f.html  Legislators push balanced budget: U.S. deficits spur amendment call], Accessed Dec. 29, 2013, "...Legislatures have petitioned Congress to adopt an amendment in the past. Kelly recalled voting for one in 1983...."&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013, [[State of Ohio|Ohio]] applied.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Pelzer, Northeast Ohio Media Group, November 22, 2013, [http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2013/11/ohio_lawmakers_join_in_push_fo.html Ohio lawmakers join in push for national convention on balanced-budget amendment], Accessed Dec. 29, 2013, "...under Article V of the U.S. Constitution, such a convention would be held if 34 state legislatures ask for it...  would then have to be ratified by 38 states to take effect...."&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1975, [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Jerry Pettis]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[California]], introduced a [[concurrent resolution]] ([[94th United States Congress|94th]] H.Con.Res.28&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/94th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/28/titles&lt;/ref&gt;) calling a convention to propose amendments to the Constitution. In it, Pettis proposed that each state would be entitled to send as many delegates to the convention as it had Senators and Representatives in Congress and that such delegates would be selected in the manner designated by the legislature of each state. Being a concurrent rather than a [[joint resolution]], the legislation would not have—had it been adopted by both the House and Senate—triggered a national Article V convention. Rather, it would have conveyed the sentiments of Congress that one be called. On August 5, 1977, Representative [[Norman F. Lent]], Republican from [[New York (state)|New York]], introduced a similar concurrent resolution ([[95th United States Congress|95th]] H.Con.Res.340&lt;ref&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/95th-congress/house-concurrent-resolution/340?resultIndex=2&lt;/ref&gt;). Both were referred to the [[House Judiciary Committee]]. No further action on either was taken.

A report in the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' in 2011 described the movement for a convention as gaining "traction" in public debate,&lt;ref name="twsDecM3435"/&gt; and wrote that "concern over a seemingly dysfunctional climate in Washington and issues ranging from the national debt to the overwhelming influence of money in politics have spawned calls for fundamental change in the document that guides the nation's government."&lt;ref name="twsDecM3435"/&gt; For several years, state lawmakers approved no Article V Convention calls at all, and even went so far as to adopt resolutions [[List of Rescissions of Article V Convention Applications|rescinding]] their prior such calls. However, in 2011, legislators in Alabama, Louisiana, and North Dakota (in two instances) approved resolutions applying for an Article V Convention. All three of these states had adopted rescissions in 1988, 1990, and 2001, respectively, but then reversed course in 2011. The same was true in 2012 with New Hampshire lawmakers who had adopted a resolution to rescind previous convention applications as recently as 2010.

==Questions==
Numerous questions surround the issue of how such an unprecendented convention might be conducted.&lt;ref name="twsDecMfrhh"/&gt; There is no consensus on how such a convention may be organized, led, or who may be selected to be in such a body.

{{Quote|Because there has not been a constitutional convention since 1787, efforts have been clouded by unresolved legal questions: Do the calls for a convention have to happen at the same time? Can a convention be limited to just one topic? What if Congress simply refuses to call a convention?

 |accessdate= 2011-12-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Precedent===
While there is no precedent for such a convention, scholars have noted that the original [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|1787 Convention]], itself, was the first precedent, as it had only been authorized to amend the [[Articles of Confederation]], not to draw up an entirely new frame of government.&lt;ref name="twsDecMfrhh"/&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the action by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] set up a precedent that could be used today.&lt;ref name=twsNovW24&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, each time the amendment process has been initiated since 1789, it has been initiated by Congress. All 33 amendments submitted to the states for ratification originated there. The convention option, which [[Alexander Hamilton]] (writing in The [[Federalist No. 85]]) believed would serve as a barrier "against the encroachments of the national authority",&lt;ref&gt;Sen. David Long [http://www.indianasenaterepublicans.com/clientuploads/directory/publications/Sen%20David%20Long%20Article%20V%20Packet-Online.pdf "Amending the U.S. Constitution by State-Led Convention"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140124100124/http://www.indianasenaterepublicans.com/clientuploads/directory/publications/Sen%20David%20Long%20Article%20V%20Packet-Online.pdf |date=2014-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has yet to be successfully invoked, although not for lack of activity in the states.

===Scope of a possible convention===
There have been calls for a second convention based on a single issue such as the [[Balanced Budget Amendment]]. According to one count, 17 of 34 states have petitioned Congress for a "convention to propose a balanced budget amendment."&lt;ref name=twsNovW33/&gt; But Congress has been reluctant to "impose limitations on its spending and borrowing and taxing powers", according to anti-tax activist David Biddulph.&lt;ref name=twsNovW33/&gt; Law professor Michael Stokes Paulsen suggested that such a convention would have the "power to propose anything it sees fit" and that calls for a convention to focus on only one issue "may not be valid", according to this view.&lt;ref name=twsNovW33/&gt; According to Paulsen's count, 33 states have called for a general convention, although some of these calls have been pending "since the 19th century."&lt;ref name=twsNovW33/&gt;

According to a ''[[New York Times]]'' report, different groups would be nervous that a convention summoned to address only one issue might propose a wholesale revision of the entire Constitution, possibly limiting "provisions they hold dear."&lt;ref name=twsNovW24/&gt; Such groups include the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the [[John Birch Society]], the [[National Organization for Women]], the Gun Owners Clubs of America and conservative advocate [[Phyllis Schlafly]].&lt;ref name=twsNovW24/&gt; Accordingly, they are opposed to the idea of a second convention.&lt;ref name=twsNovW24/&gt; [[Lawrence Lessig]] countered that the requirement of having 38 states ratify any proposed revision—three-quarters of all state legislatures—meant that any extreme proposals would be blocked, since either [[Red states and blue states|13 red or 13 blue]] states could block such a measure.&lt;ref name=twsNovW33/&gt;

===Language===
Constitutional law scholar [[Laurence Tribe]] noted that the language in the current Constitution about how to implement a second one is "dangerously vague", and that there is a possibility that the same interests that have corrupted Washington's politics may have a hand in efforts to rewrite it.&lt;ref name="twsDecM3435"/&gt; Politicians and scholars who are reluctant to have a second constitutional convention may insist that all 34 state petitions to Congress must have an identical wording or otherwise the petitions would be considered invalid.&lt;ref name=twsNovW14&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shall also be necessary for one state to initially create a resolution and subsequently pass; and then this same resolution, which passes, must circulate among the several states and be approved by the necessary two thirds before a convention would be held.  In other words, one document would be drawn up and passed by the states that would state the rules governing such a convention.  The Founding Fathers allowed for such flexibility within the U.S. Constitution.

==Particular views==
[[File:Lawrence Lessig at ETech 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Lawrence Lessig]]
[[Harvard Law School]] professor [[Lawrence Lessig]] has argued that a movement to urge state legislatures to call for a constitutional Convention&lt;ref name=twsNovW33/&gt; was the best possibility to achieve substantive reform:
{{Quote|But somebody at the convention said that "what if Congress is the problem—what do we do then?" So they set up an alternative path... that states can call on Congress to call a Convention. The convention, then, proposes the amendments, and those amendments have to pass by three fourths of the states. So, either way, thirty eight states have to ratify an amendment, but the sources of those amendments are different. One is ''inside'', one is ''outside''.|[[Lawrence Lessig]], 2011.&lt;ref name=twsDecMupoi&gt;{{cite news

Lessig argued that the ordinary means of politics were not feasible to solve the problem affecting the United States government because the incentives corrupting politicians are so powerful.&lt;ref name=twsDecMupoi/&gt; Lessig believes a convention is needed in view of Supreme Court decisions to eliminate most limits on [[campaign contribution]]s.&lt;ref name=twsNovW13/&gt; He quoted [[United States Congress|congressperson]] [[Jim Cooper]] from [[Tennessee]] who remarked that Congress had become a "Farm League for [[K Street (Washington, D.C.)|K Street]]" in the sense that congresspersons were focused on lucrative careers as [[Lobbying in the United States|lobbyists]] after serving in the Congress, and not on serving the public interest.&lt;ref name=twsDecM9009&gt;{{cite news

Few new constitutions are modeled along the lines of the U.S. one, according to a study by David Law of [[Washington University]].&lt;ref name=MassDailyCollegian/&gt; Supreme Court Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] views the United States Constitution as more of a relic of the 18th century rather than as a model for new constitutions, and she suggested in 2014 that a nation seeking a new constitution might find a better model by examining the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution of South Africa (1997)]], the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982)]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention on Human Rights (1950)]]:&lt;ref name=MassDailyCollegian&gt;Staff reporters and Steven Sweeney, March 4, 2012, Massachusetts Daily Collegian, [http://dailycollegian.com/2012/03/04/a-second-constitutional-convention/ A Second Constitutional Convention], Accessed April 7, 2014, "...As Justice Ginsburg’s comments suggest, the U.S. Constitution is more a relic of the 18th century than a workable plan for government in the 21st. A recent study conducted by David Law ... concluded that our Constitution’s global appeal has diminished markedly...."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Seeds of Change: Five Plants That Transformed Mankind''''' is a 1985 book by [[Henry Hobhouse (author)|Henry Hobhouse]] which explains how the history of the world since [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] linked America to Europe and has been changed by five plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/12204278/Henry-Hobhouse-author-obituary.html|title=Henry Hobhouse, author - obituary|work=Daily Telegraph|date= 25 March 2016|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It describes how mankind's discovery, usage and trade of [[sugar]], [[tea]], [[cotton]], the [[potato]], and [[quinine]] have influenced history to make the modern world.

In the second edition of the book,  '''''Seeds of Change: Six Plants that Transformed Mankind''''', he adds the [[coca plant]] to the list.  In 2004, he published a follow-up book ''Seeds of Wealth: Four Plants That Made Men Rich'' covering timber, wine, rubber, and tobacco.

'''Sympathetic magic''', also known as '''imitative magic''', is a type of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] based on imitation or correspondence.

==Similarity and contagion==
It has been said that the theory of sympathetic magic was first developed by Sir [[James George Frazer]] in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1889); [[Richard Andree]], however, anticipates Frazer, writing of 'Sympathie-Zauber' in his 1878 ''Ethnographische Parallelen und Vergleiche''. Frazer further subcategorised sympathetic magic into two varieties: that relying on similarity, and that relying on contact or 'contagion':
{{Quote |If we analyze the principles of thought on which magic is based, they will probably be found to resolve themselves into two: first, that like produces like, or that an effect resembles its cause; and, second, that things which have once been in contact with each other continue to act on each other at a distance after the physical contact has been severed. The former principle may be called the Law of Similarity, the latter the Law of Contact or Contagion. From the first of these principles, namely the Law of Similarity, the magician infers that he can produce any effect he desires merely by imitating it: from the second he infers that whatever he does to a material object will affect equally the person with whom the object was once in contact, whether it formed part of his body or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3623/3623-h/3623-h.htm#c3section1 | publisher = Bartleby | title = The Golden Bough | year = 1922 | chapter = 3: Sympathetic Magic; Part 1: The Principles of Magic}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Imitation==
Imitation involves using [[effigies]], [[fetishes]] or [[poppet]]s to affect the environment of people, or occasionally people themselves.  [[Voodoo doll]]s are an example of fetishes used in this way. Such as using a lock of hair on the doll creating a "link" between the doll and the person the hair came from so whatever happens to the doll will also happen on the person.

==Correspondence==
[[Correspondence (theology)|Correspondence]] is based on the idea that one can influence something based on its relationship or resemblance to another thing. Many popular beliefs regarding properties of plants, fruits and vegetables have evolved in the [[traditional medicine|folk-medicine]] of different societies owing to sympathetic magic. This include beliefs that certain herbs with [[yellow]] sap can cure [[jaundice]], that [[walnut]]s could strengthen the brain because of the nuts' resemblance to brain, that [[red beet]]-juice is good for the blood, that phallic-shaped roots will cure [[male impotence]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Harrison| first = Regina | title = Signs, songs, and memory in the Andes: translating Quechua language and culture| publisher = [[University of Texas Press]]| year = 1989| page = 178| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=t6RkAAAAMAAJ | isbn = 978-0-292-77627-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many traditional societies believed that an effect on one object can cause an analogous effect on another object, without an apparent causal link between the two objects. For instance, many folktales feature a villain whose "life" exists in another object, and who can only be killed if that other object is destroyed. (Examples including [[Sauron]]'s [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and the [[Russian folktale]] of [[Koschei the Deathless]]. Compare [[Horcrux]] and [[lich]].) [[Mircea Eliade]] wrote that in [[Uganda]], a [[barren woman]] is thought to cause a barren garden, and her husband can seek a divorce on purely economic grounds.&lt;ref name= " Haper &amp; Row - 1976 - A Mircea Eliade Reader - "&gt;{{cite book | author-link = Mircea Eliade | first = Mircea | last = Eliade |title=Myths, Rites, Symbols: A Mircea Eliade Reader|editor1-first =Wendell C | editor1-last = Beane | editor2-first = William G | editor2-last = Doty|publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]| year=1976|page =385|isbn=978-0-06-090510-1|oclc= 2136392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many societies have been documeted as believing that, instead of requiring an image of an individual, influence can be exerted using something that they have touched or used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Rehabilitation interventions: Ideas based on a South Pacific example|author-last=Gregory|author-first=R. J.| journal=Disability and Rehabilitation|volume=18|issue=1|date=1996|doi=10.3109/09638289609167089|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the inhabitants of [[Tanna (island)|Tanna, Vanuatu]] in the 1970s were cautious when throwing away food or losing a fingernail, as they believed these small scraps of personal items could be used to cast a spell causing fevers. Similarly, an 18th-century compendium of Russian [[Folk Orthodoxy|folk magic]] describes how someone could be influenced through sprinkling cursed salt on a path frequently used by the victim,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Witchcraft and Medicine in Pre-Petrine Russia|author-last=Zguta|author-first=Russell|journal=The Russian Review|volume=37|issue=4|date=1978|p=446|jstor=128509}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a 15th-century [[Hwi-bin Kim|crown princess of Joseon Korea]] is recorded as having cut her husband's lovers' shoes into pieces and burnt them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=世宗實錄 |trans-title=[[Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty|Veritable Records of Sejong]]|date=1454|url=http://sillok.history.go.kr/search/inspectionMonthList.do?id=kda|volume=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypotheses about prehistoric sympathetic magic==
The term is most commonly used in [[archaeology]] in relation to [[Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s such as those in [[North Africa]] and at [[Lascaux]] in [[France]].  The theory is one of prehistoric human behavior, and is based on studies of more modern [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. The idea is that the paintings were made by [[Cro-Magnon]] [[Shamanism|shaman]]s. The shamans would retreat into the darkness of the caves, enter into a [[trance]] state and then paint images of their visions, perhaps with some notion of drawing power out of the cave walls themselves. This goes some way towards explaining the remoteness of some of the paintings (which often occur in deep or small caves) and the variety of subject matter (from prey animals to [[predator]]s and human hand-prints). In his book ''Primitive Mythology'', [[Joseph Campbell]] stated that the paintings "...were associated with the magic of the hunt." For him, this sympathetic magic was akin to a ''[[participation mystique]]'', where the paintings, drawn in a sanctuary of "timeless principle", were acted upon by rite.

In 1933, [[Leo Frobenius]], discussing [[Cave painting#Africa|cave paintings in North Africa]], pointed out that many of the paintings did not seem to be mere depictions of animals and people. To him, it seemed as if they were acting out a hunt before it began, perhaps as a consecration of the animal to be killed. In this way, the pictures served to secure a successful hunt. While others interpreted the cave images as depictions of hunting accidents or of ceremonies, Frobenius believed it was much more likely that "...what was undertaken [in the paintings] was a consecration of the animal effected not through any real confrontation of man and beast but by a depiction of a concept of the mind."

In 2005, Francis Thackeray published a paper in the journal Antiquity, in which he recognised that there was a strong case for the principle of sympathetic magic in southern Africa in prehistory.  For example, a rock engraving from Wonderwerk Cave in South Africa (dated at 4000 years before the present, BP) showed a zebra which had probably been "symbolically wounded", with incisions on the rump being associated with wounds.  Ochre on the engraved slab could represent blood. A prehistoric rock painting at Melikane in Lesotho shows what appear to be men (shamans) bending forward like animals, with two sticks to represent the front legs of an antelope.  Thackeray suggests that these men, perhaps shamans or "medicine-men" dressed under animal skins, were associated with hunting rituals of the kind recorded by H. Lichtenstein in 1812 in South Africa, in which a hunter simulated an antelope which was symbolically killed by other hunters, in the belief that this was essential for a successful hunt.  Such rituals could be represented in prehistoric art such as paintings at Melikane in Lesotho.  Thackeray suggests that the Melikane therianthropes are associated with both trance and the principle of sympathetic hunting magic  In 2005, in the journal Antiquity, Francis Thackeray suggests that there is even a photograph of such rituals, recorded in 1934 at Logageng in the southern Kalahari, South Africa. Such rituals may have been closely associated with both roan antelope and eland, and other animals.

In the Brandberg in Namibia, in the so-called "White Lady" panel recorded by the Abbe Henri Breuil and Harald Pager, there are "symbolic wounds" on the belly of a gemsbok-like therianthrope (catalogued as T1), which might relate to the principle of sympathetic hunting magic and trance, as suggested by Thackeray in 2013.

At the Apollo 11 cave in Namibia, Erich Wendt discovered mobile art about 30,000 years old, including a stone broken in two pieces, with a gemsbok-like therianthrope that closely resembles the Brandberg therianthrope which Thackeray catalogues as T1.   Both examples of art may be related to sympathetic hunting magic and shamanism.

In 2013 Thackeray emphasised that in southern Africa, the principle of sympathetic hunting magic and shamanism (trance) were not mutually exclusive.

However, as with all [[prehistory]], it is impossible to be certain due to the limited evidence and the many pitfalls associated with trying to understand the prehistoric mindset with a modern [[Mind#Evolutionary history of the human mind|mind]].

==Popular culture==
The concept of sympathetic magic features prominently in the [[The Kingkiller Chronicle|Kingkiller Chronicle]] novel series by [[Patrick Rothfuss]].

Merricat Blackwood in [[Shirley Jackson]]'s ''[[We Have Always Lived in the Castle]]'' is a practitioner of sympathetic magic.

In [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]'', sympathetic magic is practiced prominently.

The music duo Charming Disaster has a song called "Sympathetic Magic". A duet between the magic user and her target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://charmingdisaster.bandcamp.com/track/sympathetic-magic|title=Sympathetic magic lyrics|last=|first=|date=|website=Bandcamp.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Four Apostles''''' is a [[panel painting]] by the German [[Renaissance]] master [[Albrecht Dürer]]. It was finished in 1526, and is the last of his large works. It depicts the four apostles larger-than-life-size.  The Bavarian  [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Elector Maximilian I]] obtained ''The Four Apostles'' in the year 1627 due to pressure on the Nuremberg city fathers.  Since then, the painting has been in [[Munich]] and, despite all the efforts of Nuremberg since 1806, it has not been returned.

==Description==
{{external media | width = 210px | headerimage = [[File:Albrecht Dürer - The Four Holy Men (detail) - WGA07027.jpg|210px]] | align = right | video1 =[http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/durer-four-apostles.html Smarthistory - Dürer's ''The Four Apostles'']}}
When Dürer moved back to [[Nuremberg]] he produced many famous paintings there, including several self-portraits. He gave ''The Four Apostles'' to the town council.  Saints John and Peter appear in the left panel; the figures in the right panel are Saints Mark and Paul. Mark and Paul both hold Bibles, and John and Peter are shown reading from the opening page of John's own Gospel.  At the bottom of each panel, quotations from the Bible are inscribed.&lt;ref name=smart&gt;

The apostles are recognizable by their symbols:
*St. John the Evangelist: open book
*St. Peter: keys
*St. Mark: scroll
*St. Paul: sword and closed book

They are also associated with the [[four temperaments]].
*St. John: sanguine
*St. Peter: phlegmatic
*St. Mark: choleric
*St. Paul: melancholy

==Historical context==
''The Four Apostles'' was created during the Reformation, begun in 1517 and having the largest initial impact on Germany. As it was a Protestant belief that icons were contradictory to the Word of God, which was held in the utmost supremacy over Protestant ideas, the Protestant church was not a patron of any sacred art. Therefore, any Protestant artist, like Dürer became, had to commission their own works. Many aspects of the image depicted prove significant in light of the Reformation itself.&lt;ref name=smart/&gt;

'''Totalitarianism''' is a political concept of a mode of government which prohibits opposition parties, restricts individual opposition to the state and its claims, and exercises an extremely high degree of control over public and private life. It is regarded as the most extreme and complete form of [[authoritarianism]]. [[Political power]] in totalitarian states has often been held by [[Dictatorship|rule by one leader]] which employ all-encompassing [[propaganda]] campaigns broadcast by state-controlled [[mass media]]. Totalitarian regimes and are often marked by [[political repression]], [[personality cultism]], [[Command economy|control over the economy]], [[censorship|restriction of speech]], [[mass surveillance]] and widespread use of [[state terrorism]]. Historian Robert Conquest describes a "totalitarian" state as one recognizing no limits to its authority in any sphere of public or private life and which extends that authority to whatever length feasible.&lt;ref name="reflections2"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Conquest|title=Reflections on a Ravaged Century|date=1999|isbn=0-393-04818-7|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was first developed in the 1920s by both [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] jurist (and later [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] academic) [[Carl Schmitt]] and, concurrently, by the [[Italian fascism|Italian fascists]]. Italian fascist [[Benito Mussolini]] said "Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state". Schmitt used the term ''Totalstaat'' in his influential 1927 work on the legal basis of an all-powerful state, ''[[The Concept of the Political]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl|last=Schmitt|date=1927|title=The Concept of the Political (German: Der Begriff des Politischen)|isbn=0-226-73886-8|edition=1996 University of Chicago Press|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the concept was used extensively to [[Comparison of Nazism and Stalinism|compare Nazism and Stalinism]].  The Economist has described [[China]]'s recently developed [[Social Credit System|social credit system]] to screen and rank its citizens based on their personal behavior as "totalitarian".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/briefing/2016/12/17/china-invents-the-digital-totalitarian-state |title=China invents the digital totalitarian state |last= |date=17 December 2017 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4|title=China has started ranking citizens with a creepy 'social credit' system — here's what you can do wrong, and the embarrassing, demeaning ways they can punish you|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/china-experiments-with-sweeping-social-credit-system/a-42030727|title=China experiments with sweeping Social Credit System |date=4 January 2018 |publisher=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2018-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Totalitarian regimes are different from other [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian ones]]. The latter denotes a state in which the single power holder – an individual "[[dictator]]", a committee or a [[Military dictatorship|junta]] or an otherwise small group of political elite – monopolizes political power. "[The] authoritarian state [...] is only concerned with political power and as long as that is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"&gt;Radu Cinpoes, ''Nationalism and Identity in Romania: A History of Extreme Politics from the Birth of the State to EU Accession'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarianism "does not attempt to change the world and human nature".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt; In contrast, a totalitarian regime attempts to control virtually all aspects of the social life, including the economy, education, art, science, private life and morals of citizens. Some totalitarian governments may promote an elaborate ideology: "The officially proclaimed [[ideology]] penetrates into the deepest reaches of societal structure and the totalitarian government seeks to completely control the thoughts and actions of its citizens".&lt;ref name="regime"/&gt; It also mobilizes the whole population in pursuit of its goals. [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] writes that "a totalist ideology, a party reinforced by a [[secret police]], and monopoly control of [...] industrial mass society" are the three features of totalitarian regimes that distinguish them from other autocracies.&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt;

==Early concepts and use==
The notion of totalitarianism as a "total" political power by the state was formulated in 1923 by [[Giovanni Amendola]], who described [[Italian Fascism]] as a system fundamentally different from conventional [[dictatorship]]s.&lt;ref name="regime"&gt;* {{citation| author =Richard Pipes | author-link =Richard Pipes | publication-date = | year =1995 | title = Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime | place =New York | publisher =Vintage Books, Random House Inc. | isbn =0394502426 | page =243}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later assigned a positive meaning in the writings of [[Giovanni Gentile]], Italy’s most prominent philosopher and leading theorist of [[fascism]]. He used the term ''totalitario'' to refer to the structure and goals of the new state, which were to provide the "total representation of the nation and total guidance of national goals".&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G., ''Fascism: Comparison and Definition'' (UW Press, 1980), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; He described totalitarianism as a society in which the ideology of the state had influence, if not power, over most of its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, Giovanni and Benito Mussolini in "La dottrina del fascismo" (1932)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Benito Mussolini]], this system politicizes everything spiritual and human: "Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state".&lt;ref name="regime"/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Conquest, Robert, ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment'' (Oxford University Press, 1990) {{ISBN|0-19-507132-8}}, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first to use the term "totalitarianism" in the English language was the Austrian writer [[Franz Borkenau]] in his 1938 book ''The Communist International'', in which he commented that it united the Soviet and German dictatorships more than it divided them.&lt;ref&gt;Nemoianu, Virgil, "Review of ''End and Beginnings''" pp. 1235–38 from MLN, Volume 97, Issue #5, December 1982, p.1235.&lt;/ref&gt; The label "totalitarian" was twice affixed to the [[Nazi Germany|Hitler regime]] during [[Winston Churchill]]'s speech of October 5, 1938&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston, [http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1930-1938-the-wilderness/the-munich-agreement Speech to the House of Commons, October 5, 1938]: "We in this country, as in other Liberal and democratic countries, have a perfect right to exalt the principle of self-determination, but it comes ill out of the mouths of those in totalitarian states who deny even the smallest element of toleration to every section and creed within their bounds."

"Many of those countries, in fear of the rise of the Nazi power, ... loathed the idea of having this arbitrary rule of the totalitarian system thrust upon them, and hoped that a stand would be made."&lt;/ref&gt; before the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in opposition to the [[Munich Agreement]], by which France and Great Britain consented to [[Nazi Germany]]'s annexation of the [[Sudetenland]]. Churchill was then a [[backbencher]] MP representing the [[Epping (UK Parliament constituency)|Epping constituency]]. In a radio address two weeks later, Churchill again employed the term, this time applying the concept to "a Communist or a Nazi tyranny".&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Winston, [http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1930-1938-the-wilderness/the-defence-of-freedom-and-peace Radio Broadcast to the United States and to London, October 16, 1938]&lt;/ref&gt;

The leader of the historic Spanish [[reactionary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Michael |date=2004 |title=Fascists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTE7ytbtp_cC |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=331 |isbn=9780521831314 |author-link=Michael_Mann_(sociologist) }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conservatism|conservative]] party called the [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] declared his intention to "give Spain a true unity, a new spirit, a totalitarian polity" and went on to say: "[[Democracy]] is not an end but a means to the conquest of the new state. When the time comes, either [[Cortes Generales|parliament]] submits or we will eliminate it".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Preston. ''The Spanish Civil War: reaction, revolution and revenge''. 3rd edition. W. W. New York, New York: Norton &amp; Company, Inc, 2007. 2006 pp. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Orwell]] made frequent use of the word totalitarian and its cognates in multiple essays published in 1940, 1941 and 1942. In his essay ''[[Why I Write]]'', he wrote: "The [[Spanish Civil War|Spanish war]] and other events in 1936-37 turned the scale and thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for [[democratic socialism]], as I understand it".&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George, [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0300011h.html#part47 "Why I Write"], Gangrel (Summer) 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 1945 lecture series entitled ''The Soviet Impact on the Western World'' (published as a book in 1946), the pro-Soviet British historian [[E. H. Carr]] claimed: "The trend away from individualism and towards totalitarianism is everywhere unmistakable" and that [[Marxism–Leninism]] was by far the most successful type of totalitarianism as proved by Soviet industrial growth and the [[Red Army]]'s role in defeating Germany. Only the "blind and incurable" could ignore the trend towards totalitarianism, said Carr.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution'', New York: Scribner, 1987, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) and ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' (1961), [[Karl Popper]] articulated an influential critique of totalitarianism: in both works, he contrasted the "open society" of [[liberal democracy]] with totalitarianism and argued that the latter is grounded in the belief that history moves toward an immutable future in accordance with knowable laws.

In ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', [[Hannah Arendt]] argued that [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Communism|Communist]] regimes were new forms of government and not merely updated versions of the old [[tyrannies]]. According to Arendt, the source of the mass appeal of totalitarian regimes is their [[ideology]], which provides a comforting, single answer to the mysteries of the past, present and future. For Nazism, all history is the history of [[race struggle]] and for [[Marxism]] all history is the history of [[class struggle]]. Once that premise is accepted, all actions of the state can be justified by [[appeal to nature]] or the [[Historicism|law of history]], justifying their establishment of authoritarian state apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Richard Villa (2000), ''The Cambridge Companion to Hannah Arendt''. Cambridge University Press, pp. 2–3. {{ISBN|0-521-64571-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Arendt, many scholars from a variety of academic backgrounds and ideological positions have closely examined totalitarianism. Among the most noted commentators on totalitarianism are [[Raymond Aron]], Lawrence Aronsen, Franz Borkenau, [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], [[Robert Conquest]], [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]], Eckhard Jesse, [[Leopold Labedz]], [[Walter Laqueur]], [[Claude Lefort]], [[Juan Linz]], [[Richard Löwenthal]], Karl Popper, [[Richard Pipes]], [[Leonard Schapiro]] and [[Adam Ulam]]. Each one of these describes totalitarianism in slightly different ways, but they all agree that totalitarianism seeks to mobilize entire populations in support of an official state ideology and is intolerant of activities which are not directed towards the goals of the state, entailing repression or state control of [[business]], [[labour union]]s, [[non-profit organizations]], religious organizations and buildings and [[political party|political parties]].

==Cold War anti-totalitarianism&lt;!--'Anti-totalitarianism', 'Antitotalitarianism', 'Anti-totalitarian', and 'Anti-totalitarian' redirect here--&gt;==
The concept became prominent in [[Western world|Western]] [[anti-communist]] political discourse during the [[Cold War]] era as a tool to convert pre-war [[anti-fascism]] into postwar anti-communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Brook|last=Defty|date=2007|title=Britain, America and Anti-Communist Propaganda 1945–1953|publisher=The Information Research Department|others=Chapters 2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Achim Siegel, ''The totalitarian paradigm after the end of Communism: towards a theoretical reassessment'', 1998, p. 200 "Concepts of totalitarianism became most widespread at the height of the Cold War. Since the late 1940s, especially since the Korean War, they were condensed into a far-reaching, even hegemonic, ideology, by which the political elites of the Western world tried to explain and even to justify the Cold War constellation"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Guilhot, ''The democracy makers: human rights and international order'', 2005, p. 33 "The opposition between the West and Soviet totalitarianism was often presented as an opposition both moral and epistemological between truth and falsehood. The democratic, social, and economic credentials of the Soviet Union were typically seen as "lies" and as the product of a deliberate and multiform propaganda...In this context, the concept of totalitarianism was itself an asset. As it made possible the conversion of prewar anti-fascism into postwar anti-communism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Caute, ''Politics and the novel during the Cold War'', 2009, pp. 95–99&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George A Reisch, ''How the Cold War transformed philosophy of science: to the icy slopes of logic'', 2005, pp. 153–54&lt;/ref&gt;

The political scientists [[Carl Friedrich]] and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] were primarily responsible for expanding the usage of the term in university social science and professional research, reformulating it as a paradigm for the [[Soviet Union]] as well as [[fascist]] regimes. Friedrich and Brzezinski argue that a totalitarian system has the following six, mutually supportive, defining characteristics:
# Elaborate guiding [[ideology]].
# [[one-party state|Single mass party]], typically led by a [[dictator]].
# [[state terrorism|System of terror]], using such instruments as violence and [[secret police]].
# Monopoly on weapons.
# Monopoly on the [[Mass media|means of communication]].
# Central direction and control of the economy through [[state planning]].

Totalitarian regimes in Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union had initial origins in the chaos that followed in the wake of [[World War I]] and allowed totalitarian movements to seize control of the government while the sophistication of modern weapons and communications enabled them to effectively establish what Friedrich and Brzezinski called a "totalitarian dictatorship". Some [[Social science|social scientists]] have criticized Friedrich and Brzezinski's '''anti-totalitarian'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; approach, arguing that the Soviet system, both as a political and as a social entity, was in fact better understood in terms of [[interest group]]s, competing elites, or even in [[social class|class]] terms (using the concept of the ''[[nomenklatura]]'' as a vehicle for a [[New class|new ruling class]]).&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 186–89, 233–34&lt;/ref&gt; These critics pointed to evidence of popular support for the regime and widespread dispersion of power, at least in the implementation of policy, among sectoral and regional authorities. For some followers of this [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralist]] approach, this was evidence of the ability of the regime to adapt to include new demands. However, proponents of the totalitarian model claimed that the failure of the system to survive showed not only its inability to adapt, but the mere formality of supposed popular participation.

The German historian [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], whose work is primarily concerned with Nazi Germany, argues that the "totalitarian typology" as developed by Friedrich and Brzezinski is an excessively inflexible model and failed to consider the "revolutionary dynamic" that Bracher asserts is at the heart of totalitarianism.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 25"&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold; New York p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Bracher maintains that the essence of totalitarianism is the total claim to control and remake all aspects of society combined with an all-embracing ideology, the value on authoritarian leadership and the pretence of the common identity of state and society, which distinguished the totalitarian "closed" understanding of politics from the "open" democratic understanding.&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian page 25"/&gt; Unlike the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition, Bracher argued that totalitarian regimes did not require a single leader and could function with a [[collective leadership]], which led the American historian [[Walter Laqueur]] to argue that Bracher's definition seemed to fit reality better than the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter'' The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'', New York: Scribner's, 1987 p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[The True Believer]]'', [[Eric Hoffer]] argues that mass movements like [[Stalinism]], [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]] had a common trait in picturing Western democracies and their values as [[decadent]], with people "too soft, too [[Hedonism|pleasure-loving]] and too [[selfish]]" to [[sacrifice]] for a higher cause, which for them implies an inner moral and biological decay. He further claims that those movements offered the prospect of a glorious future to frustrated people, enabling them to find a refuge from the lack of personal accomplishments in their individual existence. The individual is then assimilated into a compact collective body and "fact-proof screens from reality" are established.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hoffer, ''The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements'', Harper Perennial Modern Classics (2002), {{ISBN|0-06-050591-5}}, pp. 61, 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later research==
In the 1990s, [[François Furet]] used the term "[[totalitarian twins]]"&lt;ref&gt;"Furet, borrowing from [[Hannah Arendt]], describes [[Bolshevik]]s and [[Nazism|Nazis]] as totalitarian twins, conflicting yet united." [http://www.thenation.com/doc/19950417/singer Singer, Daniel, ''The Nation'' (April 17, 1995)]&lt;/ref&gt; to link [[Stalinism]]&lt;ref&gt;"The totalitarian nature of Stalin's Russia is undeniable." [http://www.thenation.com/doc/19991213/singer/3 Singer, Singer,''The Nation'']&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nazism]].&lt;ref&gt;"The government of [[Nazi Germany]] was a fascist, totalitarian state." [http://www.remember.org/guide/Facts.root.nazi.html Grobman, Gary M.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Hobsbawm]] criticized Furet for his temptation to stress a common ground between two systems of different ideological roots.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Hobsbawm (2012), ''Revolutionaries''. Abacus, Ch. 7. {{ISBN|0-34-912056-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of Soviet history, the totalitarian concept has been disparaged by the [[historical revisionism|revisionist]] school, some of whose more prominent members were [[Sheila Fitzpatrick]], [[Jerry F. Hough]], William McCagg, [[Robert W. Thurston]] and [[J. Arch Getty]].&lt;ref name="Laqueur, Walter pages 225-227"&gt;Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 225–27&lt;/ref&gt; Though their individual interpretations differ, the revisionists have argued that the Soviet state under [[Joseph Stalin]] was institutionally weak, that the level of terror was much exaggerated and that—to the extent it occurred—it reflected the weaknesses rather than the strengths of the Soviet state.&lt;ref name="Laqueur, Walter pages 225-227"/&gt; Fitzpatrick argued that the Stalin's purges in the Soviet Union provided an increased social mobility and therefore a chance for a better life.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 225, 228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, Sheila, ''Everyday Stalinism: Ordinary Life in Extraordinary Times: Soviet Russia in the 1930s'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1987, [[Walter Laqueur]] said that the revisionists in the field of Soviet history were guilty of confusing popularity with morality and of making highly embarrassing and not very convincing arguments against the concept of the Soviet Union as a totalitarian state.&lt;ref name="Laqueur, Walter p. 228"&gt;Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Laqueur argued that the revisionists' arguments with regard to Soviet history were highly similar to the arguments made by [[Ernst Nolte]] regarding German history.&lt;ref name="Laqueur, Walter p. 228"/&gt; Laqueur asserted that concepts such as modernization were inadequate tools for explaining Soviet history while totalitarianism was not.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laqueur's argument has been criticized by modern revisionist historians, such as [[Paul Buhle]], who claim that Laqueur wrongly equates Cold-war revisionism with the German revisionism. The latter reflected a "revanchist, military-minded conservative nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Buhle and Edward Francis Rice-Maximin (1995), ''William Appleman Williams: The Tragedy of Empire''. Psychology Press, p. 192. {{ISBN|0-34-912056-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Enzo Traverso]] has attacked the creators of the concept of totalitarianism, who invented it to designate the enemies of the West.&lt;ref&gt;Enzo Traverso (2001), ''Le Totalitarisme: Le XXe siècle en débat''. Poche. {{ISBN|978-2020378574}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Domenico Losurdo]], totalitarianism is a polysemic concept with origins in [[Christian theology]], and that applying it to the political sphere requires an operation of abstract schematism which makes use of isolated elements of historical reality to place [[fascist]] regimes and the [[USSR]] in the dock together, serving the [[anti-communism]] of [[Cold War]]-era intellectuals rather than reflecting intellectual research. Other scholars, such as [[F. William Engdahl]], [[Sheldon Wolin]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]], have linked totalitarianism to capitalism and liberalism and used concepts, such as [[totalitarian democracy]], [[inverted totalitarianism]] or [[totalitarian capitalism]].

In the 2010s, Vladimir Tismaneanu, Richard Shorten and Aviezer Tucker argued that totalitarian ideologies can take different forms in different political systems, but all of them focus on utopianism, scientism and/or political violence. They think that both Nazism and Soviet Communism emphasised the role of specialisation in modern societies and saw [[polymathy]] as "a thing of the past"; both claimed to have statistical scientific support for their claims, which led to a strict "ethical" control of culture, psychological violence and persecution of entire groups.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Shorten "Modernism and Totalitarianism: Rethinking the Intellectual Sources of Nazism and Stalinism, 1945 to the Present", Palgrave, 2012; Vladimir Tismaneanu, “The Devil in History: Communism, Fascism, and Some Lessons of the Twentieth Century”, University of California Press, 2012; Aviezer Tucker "The Legacies of Totalitarianism: A Theoretical Framework", Cambridge University Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Their arguments have been criticised by other scholars due to their partiality and anachronism. For instance, Juan Francisco Fuentes treats totalitarianism as an “[[invented tradition]]” and the use of notion of “modern [[despotism]]” as a “reverse anachronism”. For Fuentes, “the anachronistic use of totalitarian/totalitarianism involves the will to reshape the past in the image and likeness of the present.”&lt;ref&gt;Juan Francisco Fuentes, “How Words reshape the Past: The ‘Old, Old Story’ of Totalitarianism”, Politics, Religion &amp; Ideology, 2015, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Totalitarianism in architecture==
{{main|Totalitarian architecture}}
Non-political aspects of the culture and motifs of totalitarian countries have themselves often been labeled innately "totalitarian". For example, [[Theodore Dalrymple]], a British author, physician and political commentator, has written for ''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]'' that [[Brutalism|brutalist structures]] are an expression of totalitarianism given that their grand, concrete-based design involves destroying gentler, more-human places such as [[gardens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_4_otbie-le-corbusier.html|title=The Architect as Totalitarian|date=Autumn 2009|author=[[Theodore Dalrymple]]|publisher=''[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]''|accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, author [[George Orwell]] described the [[Ministry of Truth]] in ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' as an "enormous, pyramidal structure of white concrete, soaring up terrace after terrace, three hundred metres into the air". [[Columnist]] [[Ben Macintyre]] of ''[[The Times]]'' wrote that it was "a prescient description of the sort of totalitarian architecture that would soon dominate the Communist bloc".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/ben_macintyre/article1588757.ece|title=Look on those monuments to megalomania, and despair|date=March 30, 2007|publisher=''[[The Times]]''|author=[[Ben Macintyre]]|accessdate=January 5, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829160102/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/ben_macintyre/article1588757.ece|archivedate=August 29, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of totalitarianism in architecture is the [[Panopticon]], a type of institutional building designed by English philosopher and social theorist [[Jeremy Bentham]] in the late eighteenth century. The concept of the design is to allow a watchman to observe (-opticon) all (pan-) inmates of an institution without their being able to tell whether or not they are being watched. It was invoked by [[Michel Foucault]] in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' as metaphor for "disciplinary" societies and their pervasive inclination to observe and normalise.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

'''Tétouan''' ({{lang-ar|تطوان}}, {{lang-ber|ⵜⵉⵟⵟⴰⵡⵉⵏ}}, {{lang-fr|Tétouan}}", {{lang-es|Tetuán}}) (nicknamed the ''White Dove'' - [[Arabic]]: الحمامة البيضاء)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.usac.edu/tetouan-the-white-dove-by-danielle-higgins/|title=Tetouan "the white dove" by Danielle Higgins - USAC|website=blog.usac.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a city located in northern [[Morocco]]. It lies along the [[Martil Valley]] and is one of the two major ports of Morocco on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], a few miles south of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], and about 60&amp;nbsp;km (40&amp;nbsp;mi) E.S.E. of [[Tangier]]. In the [[2014 Moroccan census]] the city recorded a population of 380,787 inhabitants.&lt;ref name=census2014/&gt; It is part of the administrative division [[Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima]].

The city has witnessed many development cycles spanning over more than 2000 years. The first settlements discovered a few miles outside of the modern city limits belonged to [[Mauretania]]n [[Berbers]] and date back to the 3rd century BC. A century later [[Phoenicians]] traded there and after them the site -known now as the ancient town of [[Tamuda]]- became a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] colony under Emperor [[Augustus]].&lt;ref name="M.

In late 13th century, the [[Marinid dynasty|Berber Marinids]] started by building a [[Kasbah|casbah]] and mosque in what is now the old city. Soon after, in 1305, the scale of the settlement was expanded by sultan [[Abu Thabit Amir]] who fortified the place.&lt;ref name="Zar' 1326"&gt;Ali ibn-abi-Zar' (1326) - Rawd Al-Kirtas (Histoire des souverains du Maghreb et annales de la ville de Fès.

The modern history of the city starts around late 15th century. It was re-built and fortified by [[Ali al-Mandri]] who emigrated from the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] city of [[Granada]] in the decade before it fell in the hands of the Catholic kings [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] during the [[Reconquista|Spanish Reconquista]] of 1492. Thousands of Muslims and Jews from Andalusia settled in the north of Morocco in general and on the ruins of the city of Tétouan.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merip.org/mer/mer178/andalusias-nostalgia-progress-harmonious-heresy|title=Andalusia's Nostalgia for Progress and Harmonious Heresy {{!}} Middle East Research and Information Project|website=www.merip.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has known a prosperous period of reconstruction and growth in various fields and became a center for the reception of Andalusian civilization.

In 1913, Tétouan became the capital of the [[Spanish protectorate of Morocco]], which was governed by the [[Caliph|Jalifa]] (Moroccan prince serving as [[Viceroy]] for the [[Sultan]]), and the Spanish "[[High Commissioner|Alto Comisario]]" accredited to him. It remained such a capital until 1956, when Morocco regained its full independence.

Tétouan is a renowned multicultural center.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/35581195|title=The new encyclopaedia Britannica.|date=1997|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|others=Encyclopaedia Britannica, inc.|pages=659|isbn=0852296339|edition= 15th |location=Chicago|oclc=35581195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Medina quarter|medina]] of Tétouan is a [[World Heritage site|UNESCO World Heritage site]] since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/837|title=Medina of Tétouan (formerly known as Titawin)|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been part of the [[UNESCO Creative Cities Network]] in the area of Crafts and Folk Art since 2017.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/creative-cities/tetouan|title=Tétouan  {{!}} Creative Cities Network|last=|first=|date=|website=en.unesco.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapnews.ma/en/top-news/regional/tetouan-joins-unesco%E2%80%99s-creative-cities-network|title=Tetouan Joins UNESCO’s Creative Cities Network {{!}} MAP|website=www.mapnews.ma|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The Berber name means literally "the eyes" and figuratively "the water springs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bnana|first=Muhned Z|date=|title=Aman Iman - One thousand Berber and Hassaniya words|url=http://www.academia.edu/7963014/Aman_Iman_-_One_thousand_Berber_and_Hassaniya_words|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=34|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before its foundation in the late 13th century, small fortifications existed here with the name Tittawin.&lt;ref&gt;''Tittawin'', Halima Ferhat, '''The Encyclopaedia of Islam''', Vol. X, ed. P.J. Bearman, T. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs, (Brill, 2000), 549.&lt;/ref&gt; Its name is first mentioned in 9th century Arabic chronicles, after the death of [[Idris II]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tittawin'', Halima Ferhat, '''The Encyclopaedia of Islam''', Vol. X, 549.&lt;/ref&gt; The official name of the Marinid city was 'Afrag' ('(royal) tent' in Berber). Unofficial documents kept referring to it as Tétouan.

According to [[Leo Africanus]], the name comes after the [[Goths]] bestowed the government of the town upon a woman with one eye and that the inhabitants called it ''Tetteguin'', meaning an eye in their language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/717137503|title=The history and description of Africa and of the notable things therein contained|pages=511|last=1550.|first=Leo, Africanus, approximately 1492-approximately|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Brown, Robert, 1842-1895.|isbn=9781108012881|location=Cambridge|oclc=717137503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
'''{{Main|History of Tétouan}}'''

=== Phoenician and Roman presence ===

{{Main|Tamuda|Mauretania Tingitana}}
A few miles outside of the city limits lies the ancient town of [[Tamuda]]. Early settlements at the outskirts of the actual city by [[Mauretania]]n [[Berbers]] date back to the 3rd century BC. Artifacts from both the [[Phoenicians|Phoenician]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era have been found in the site of [[Tamuda]].&lt;ref name="M. Tarradell, 1957, p. 272"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Azifi 1990"/&gt; It became a Roman colony under Emperor [[Augustus]].

=== Rebuilding the city-state ===
{{Main|Ali al-Mandri}}

In 1286, the [[Marinid dynasty|Marinids]] built a casbah and mosque there. The first large scale building project took place in 1305 when the settlement was expanded by the [[Marinid]] king [[Abu Thabit Amir]].&lt;ref name="Zar' 1326"/&gt; He fortified the place and had it serve as a base for attacks on [[Ceuta]], which had recently come under the rule of a rebellious member of the Marinid dynasty. In 1431, it was destroyed by the [[Crown of Castile|Castilians]], because pirates used it for their attacks. The Portuguese were already occupying the neighboring [[Ceuta]] and in 1436, its commander [[Pedro de Menezes, 1st Count of Vila Real|Pedro de Menezes (Count of Vila Real)]] dispatched a detachment of his garrison under his son [[Duarte de Menezes, 3rd Count of Viana|Duarte de Menezes]] to raid Tétouan -which was recovering from the Castillian destruction- in order to prevent it from becoming a threat to future Portuguese operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/848005|title=Histoire de l'Afrique du Nord: Tunisie, Algérie, Maroc.|last=1891-|first=Julien, Charles André,|pages=195|date=1972|publisher=Payot|oclc=848005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 15th century it was rebuilt by refugees from the [[Reconquista]] (reconquest of Spain, completed by the fall of [[Granada]] in 1492), when the [[Moors#Moors of Iberia|Andalusian Moors]], led by [[Ali al-Mandri]], a captain of the troops loyal to [[Muhammad XII of Granada|Boabdil]], the last king of the [[Emirate of Granada|Nasrid Kingdom of Granada]], took refuge in the ruined city. They first reared the walls and then filled the enclosure with houses. These Andalusians came into conflict with the [[Berbers|Berber]] Beni Hozmar tribe settling in [[Jebala people|Jebala]] lands, after which they asked the [[Wattasid]] sultan for protection. In response, he sent 80 soldiers (according to one chronicle, 40 natives of Fez and 40 Riffians). In turn, the Andalusians paid a large amount of [[mithqal]], thus insuring their autonomy. Instantly, the Andalusians, assisted by tribes from the surrounding mountains, started harassing the Spanish possessions on the Moroccan coast. These attacks led to the destruction of the city's harbor by the Spanish in 1565. During this time city was governed by the Andalusian Abu Hassan al-Mandri and the city remained autonomous from the Saadi sultans, with the Saadis constantly trying to assert their power.

=== Piracy and ''Mazmorras'' ===
[[File:Naval_flag_of_Tetuan_-_Bowles%27s_chart_of_1783.png|thumb|right|Naval flag of Tétouan (1783)|200x200px]]
As early as the 1530s and 1540s, at the time when Spain and the [[Ottoman Empire]] were disputing control over the western part of the Mediterranean, piracy was spreading and soon Tétouan became one of the main centers of the piracy in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Adriana|first=Valencia,|title=Migration and the City: Urban Effects of the Morisco Expulsion|pages=49|date=2011|publisher=UC Berkeley|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2k14r6vm|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corsairs considered it as a form of retaliation against the [[Reconquista|Spanish Reconquista]] that led to the loss of their homes back in [[al-Andalus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/8035048|title=Mediterranean island hopping : the Spanish islands : a handbook for the independent traveller|last=Dana.|first=Facaros,|date=1981|publisher=Hippocrene Books|others=Pauls, Michael.|pages=223|isbn=0882545884|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=8035048}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially that the timing coincided with the first [[Morisco]] influx to Tétouan due to the forced conversions they faced in Spain between 1501 and 1526.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49594009|title=Frontiers of heresy : the Spanish Inquisition from the Basque lands to Sicily|pages=126|last=1936|first=Monter, William,|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521522595|location=Cambridge|oclc=49594009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their collaborators included [[Anglo-Turkish piracy|English and Dutch renegades]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/949200820|title=Early modern Spain and the creation of the Mediterranean captivity, commerce, and knowledge|pages=11|last=Doctorant.|first=Herhsenzon, Daniel Bernardo,|oclc=949200820}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were mostly [[Protestantism|Protestants]] although a few had converted to [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/423067636|title=Orientalism in early modern France : Eurasian trade, exoticism, and the Ancien Régime|last=Ina.|first=Baghdiantz McCabe,|pages=86–87|date=2008|publisher=Berg|isbn=9781847884633|location=Oxford|oclc=423067636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the harbor served as a port from where piracy missions were launched, captives were taken to [[dungeon]]s. They were underground prisoner complexes with a series of connected excavated caves called ''Mazmorras''. The captives were faced with being sold to the [[Barbary slave trade|slavery market]] if ransoms were not paid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/635459383|title=Cervantes' epic novel : empire, religion, and the dream life of heroes in Persiles|last=1962|first=Armstrong-Roche, Michael,|pages=52|date=2010|publisher=University of Toronto Press|others=Gibson Library Connections|isbn=9781442687578|location=Toronto [Ont.]|oclc=635459383}}&lt;/ref&gt; These subterranean installations were rediscovered in early 20th century.

[[Miguel de Cervantes|Miguel De Cervantes]], himself a captive in [[Algiers]], [[Algeria]] between 1575–80, refers to ''Mazmorras'' in ''[[:es:El juez de los divorcios|El juez de los divorcios]]'' (The Divorce Judge) where the protagonist compares his marriage to "captivity in Tetouan’s caves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.larazon.es/cultura/marruecos-una-inspiracion-para-cervantes-FI9486214|title=Marruecos, una inspiración para Cervantes|last=Raz&amp;#243;n|first=La|work=www.larazon.es|access-date=2018-10-05|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also did it in ''[[Don Quixote]]'', in addition to talking about Tétouan in ''[[:es:El trato de Argel|El trato de Argel]]'', ''[[:es:La gran sultana|La gran sultana]]'' and ''[[La ilustre fregona]]''.

=== Late military history ===
In the 17th century, the city was governed by the wealthy al-Naksis family. At the end of the century, the city was taken by the [[Alaouite]] sultan [[Moulay Ismail]] who encountered fierce resistance. Tétouan remained fragile, until it was taken by Ahmad al-Riffi, the Alaouite governor of Tangier and leader of the Berber army [[Jaysh al-Rifi]] that had conquered [[Tangier]] from the British. Al-Riffi ushered in a period of stability in Tétouan, building many of Tétouan's landmarks such as the Meshwar palace and the Pasha mosque, the oldest still standing mosque in Tétouan. After his death, the city again rebelled and was only nominally controlled by the central government.

Elements of military constructions can be found in the original fortifications such as the three forts, the seven gates and the large outer walls that surround the old media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=El mundo militar: revista mensual, Volume 8|last=|first=|publisher=University of Wisconsin - Madison|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32382633|title=Morocco|last=Christine.|first=Osborne,|pages=107–108|date=1994|publisher=MPC|isbn=0861905407|edition=  1st rev.|location=Ashbourne|oclc=32382633}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have survived despite the changes that occurred through the expansions known to the city during multiple periods.

=== Hispano-Moroccan War and the Spanish Protectorate ===

{{Main|Hispano-Moroccan War (1859–60)|Battle of Tétouan|Spanish protectorate in Morocco}}
In 1844, Morocco lost its [[Franco-Moroccan War|war against the French]] and in 1856, it signed the "Anglo-Moroccan treaties of Friendship" with the British. The Spaniards saw the Moroccan defeat in 1844 and the 1856 treaties with the British as a sign of weakness. Spurred by a national passion for African conquest, the Spaniards declared war on Morocco in 1859 after a conflict over the borders of the Ceuta.

After a few months, Tétouan was [[Spanish-Moroccan War (1859)|taken]] on 4 February 1860 under the command of [[Leopoldo O'Donnell, 1st Duke of Tetuan|General Leopoldo O'Donnell]] who was a descendant of an old Irish royal family, the [[O'Donnells of Tyrconnell]]. He was made hereditary [[Duke of Tetuán]], and later served as [[Prime Minister of Spain]]. However, the Spanish evacuated on May 1862.

In 1913, it became the capital of the [[Spanish protectorate of Morocco]], which was governed by the [[Caliph|Jalifa]] (Moroccan prince, serving as Viceroy for the Sultan), and the Spanish "[[High Commissioner|Alto Comisario]]" accredited to him, and it remained its capital until 1956.

=== The nationalist movement ===
[[File:Tetouan-haraka-nisaiya.jpg|thumb|right|Tetouani women affiliated with [[Istiqlal Party]]|300x300px]]
Tétouan was one of the most active moroccan cities in resisting colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/841515692|title=Imperial rule and the politics of nationalism : anti-colonial protest in the French empire|pages=169–173|last=1973-|first=Lawrence, Adria,|isbn=9781107037090|location=New York, NY, USA|oclc=841515692}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nationalist movement in Tétouan was led by the charismatic leader [[Abdelkhalek Torres]] and other personalities such as Abdessalam Bennuna and historian [[Mohammed Daoud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42954024|title=Morocco since 1830 : a history|last=R.|first=Pennell, C.|date=2000|publisher=Hurst &amp; Co.|isbn=1850652732|location=London|oclc=42954024|pages=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was part of the [[Arab nationalism|pan-Arab nationalist movements]]. The movement established deep ties with Arab nationalist leaders such as former Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and [[Druze]] prince and intellectual [[Shakib Arslan]]. When Arsalan wanted to visit Morocco in August 1930 he was not given permit by the [[French protectorate in Morocco|French protectorate]] but then went to Tangier, then having [[International city|international status]] under foreign colonial powers, and from there to Tétouan where he met the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42954024|title=Morocco since 1830 : a history|last=R.|first=Pennell, C.|date=2000|publisher=Hurst &amp; Co.|isbn=1850652732|location=London|oclc=42954024|pages=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the members later joined the National [[Istiqlal Party|Party for Istiqlal]].

=== Jewish presence ===
Tétouan has been home to a significant [[Sephardi]] Jewish community which immigrated from Spain after the [[Reconquista]] and the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. This Jewish Sephardi community spoke a form of [[Judaeo-Spanish]] known as [[Haketia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Paloma|first=Vanessa|title=Judeo-Spanish in Morocco : Language, identity, separation or integration?|date=2012-09-28|url=http://books.openedition.org/cjb/217|work=La bienvenue et l’adieu {{!}} 1 : Migrants juifs et musulmans au Maghreb (XVe-XXe siècle)|volume=|pages=103–112|editor-last=Abécassis|editor-first=Frédéric|series=Description du Maghreb|publisher=Centre Jacques-Berque|isbn=|access-date=|editor2-last=Aouad|editor2-first=Rita|editor3-last=Dirèche|editor3-first=Karima}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A History and Source Book.'', 309;"''On Saturday, the second of the above-mentioned month of Sha'ban, our Master al-Yazid--may God grant him victory--ordered the pillaging of the Mellah of Tétouan. They fell upon the Jews' women and took their virginity, and they did not leave a single one of them.''"&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews lived in a ''[[mellah]]'', which is located inside the old medina.

By 1860, there were a total of 16 synagogues in Tétouan although some accounts talk about 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55502651|title=La comunidad judía de Tetuán, 1881-1940 : onomástica y sociología en el libro de registro de circuncisiones del rabino Yiṣḥaq Bar Vid Al Haṣerfaty|pages=80|last=María.|first=López Alvarez, Ana|date=2003|publisher=Museo Sefardi|isbn=8436936809|location=[Toledo, Spain]|oclc=55502651}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Migration of Moroccan Jews to Israel|exodus of Jews from Morocco after 1948]], there are very few [[Jew]]s left in Tétouan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://en.qantara.de/content/interview-with-mhammad-bennaboud-the-muslims-and-jews-of-tetouan|title=Interview with M'Hammad Bennaboud: The Muslims and Jews of Tétouan - Qantara.de|work=Qantara.de - Dialogue with the Islamic World|access-date=2018-10-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1967, only 12 remained (López Álvarez, 2003). During that period, many emigrated to [[South America]] and much later to [[Israel]], [[Spain]], [[France]] and [[Canada]]. Today, the only synagogue remaining is that of Rabbi Isaac Bengualid which serves as a museum.

The [[Paris]]-based international Jewish organization ''[[Alliance Israélite Universelle]]'' opened its first school in Tétouan in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28799186|title=A History of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict|last=A.|first=Tessler, Mark|date=1994|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=29|isbn=0253358485|location=Bloomington|oclc=28799186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
Tétouan was further expanded when it became the capital of the [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco]] between 1913 and 1956. The Spanish administration built several new neighborhoods outside the walled medina. The city underwent an intense urban transformation for which its new neighborhoods and buildings, called "[[:es:Ensanche de Tetuán|Ensanche]]" (meaning extension), acquired an image very similar to those of other Spanish cities of the time. Its structure was organized around a large circular [[plaza]], now called 'Plaza Mulay el Mehdi' (formerly Plaza [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/163789170|title=El plano de la ciudad de Tetuán.|last=de.|first=Sierra Ochoa, Alfonso|pages=20, 21, 25|date=1960|oclc=163789170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the protectorate has remained important even after the independence of the country in 1956.
 
In January 1984, and in the midst of the [[Years of Lead (Morocco)|Years of Lead]] under the reign of late [[Hassan II of Morocco|King Hassan II]], a revolt spread into several cities for several days due to price hikes concerning basic goods following the implementation of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] [[Structural adjustment]] programme before it was thwarted by a military intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/23/world/rioting-fomented-moroccan-asserts.html|title=RIOTING FOMENTED, MOROCCAN ASSERTS|last=Kamm|first=Henry|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty people were killed in Tétouan and many others were arrested and received heavy sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/24/world/envoys-estimate-60-have-died-in-moroccan-riots.html|title=ENVOYS ESTIMATE 60 HAVE DIED IN MOROCCAN RIOTS|last=Kamm|first=Henry|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people in the city still speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. On road signs often names are written both in Spanish and in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], though many signs are in Arabic and [[French language|French]], the second language of modern Morocco.

=== Culture ===
Tétouan is famed for its fine craftsmanship and musical delicacy and has been part of the [[UNESCO Creative Cities Network]] in the area of Crafts and Folk Art since 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Its cultural heritage is the product of the interaction between different cultural influences throughout centuries. It is mainly characterized by its Andalusian style and way of living&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/650248804|title=Feminist traditions in Andalusi-Moroccan oral narratives|last=Hasna.|first=Lebbady,|date=2009|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230100732|edition=  1st|location=New York|pages=19|oclc=650248804}}&lt;/ref&gt; but both Berber, Jewish and Colonial Spanish influences are present too. The city has produced many scholars in different disciplines throughout centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/9789004223196.srg-62|title=Or. 0017 - al-Anīs al-muṭrib bi-rawḍat al-qirṭās fī akhbār mulūk al-Maghrib wa-madīnat Fās - ff. 169|website=Middle Eastern Manuscripts Online 1: Pioneer Orientalists|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable spiritual leaders include [[List of Sufis|Sufi saint]] [[Ahmad ibn Ajiba]] and [[Yosef Maimon|Jewish Rabbi Yosef Maimon]].

The streets are fairly wide and straight, and many of the houses belonging to aristocratic families, descendants of those expelled from [[Al-Andalus]] by the Spanish Reconquista, possess marble fountains and have groves planted with orange trees. Within the houses and [[Moroccan riad|riads]] the ceilings are often exquisitely carved and painted in [[Hispano-Moresque]] designs, such as are found in the [[Alhambra]] of [[Granada]], and the tile-work for which Tetuan is known may be seen on floors, pillars and [[dado (architecture)|dado]]s. The city has seven gates which were closed at night up until early 20th century. Many [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Zawiya (institution)|Zawiyas]] are scattered inside the walled old city.

Tétouan has rich culinary traditions and the influence of local [[Berber cuisine|Berber]], [[Andalusian cuisine|Andalusian]] and [[Ottoman cuisine]] -brought by Algerian immigrants during the 19th century- is noted in the varieties of the dishes and pastries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/792688555|title=Authentic Recipes from Morocco.|last=Fatema.|first=Hal,|date=2012|publisher=Tuttle Pub|others=Hamon, Jean., Barbey, Bruno.|isbn=9781462905409|location=New York|oclc=792688555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional craftsmanship are concentrated in the old medina where every industry has its own quarter with the same name where workshops and shops are found. Among them are [[Zellige]] (tilework), [[Pottery]], [[Plasterwork|plaster engravings]], [[Embroidery]], [[inlaying]] with silver wire, the manufacture of thick-soled yellow slippers, much-esteemed flintlocks, and artistic towels used as cape and skirt by [[Jebala people|Jebala women]] in rural areas.

In addition to an archaeological and traditional, and modern art museums, and an archival library, Tétouan hosts a school of music and many artisan schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Tetouan|title=Tétouan {{!}} Morocco|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different music genres of local or regional origins can be found in Tétouan. Traditional [[Andalusian classical music]] is the most popular and folk signers such as [[Abdessadeq Cheqara]] are widely known in Morocco. Other popular local genres like Taktoka Jabaliya also exist and are usually played in weddings.

Tétouan hosts many international festivals such as the International Mediterranean Film Festival, The International Oud and Women's Voice (أصوات نسائية) Festival.

=== Dialect ===
While [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the official language, the city has its own dialect,&lt;ref name="A"&gt;L.

==Education==
===Education and the national movement===
During the 1920's, activists belonging to the national movement in northern Morocco, especially in Tétouan under [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|Spanish protectorate]], made science and education a supreme goal of their struggle to combat colonialism. In 1924, and after considerable effort and determination, they established a primary school and named it the "Al Madrasa al-Ahliyah" ([[Arabic]]: المدرسة الأهلية meaning National School). Among them were historian [[Mohammed Daoud]], Abdel Salam Bennouna, and Mustafa Afilal. To this end, members of the National Movement carried out a popular campaign under the leadership of the Special Education Committee established in 1934. In the summer of 1935, a group of activists met at the house of Mustafa Afilal, and after the long debate about the educational dimensions, material resources and other things, the group concluded by approving the establishment of a special secondary educational institution. The name of the institution remained suspended until the end of the year. After additional meetings, nationalist leader and Professor [[Abdelkhalek Torres]], being impressed with the role played by the "free men" in the era of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], said to his colleagues: ''most of the men of science, thought and liberation in Spain, graduated from Madrid's ''Instituto Libre''. Therefore, I hope and suggest that you call our institute the Free Institute ([[Arabic]]: المعهد الحر)''. After the approval, the Free Institute was established on November 5, 1935.&lt;ref name="presstetouan.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://presstetouan.com/news3501.html|title=معلومات جد هامة حول المعلمة التاريخية|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The students of the Institute were among the first to demonstrate and protest against the Spanish administration. The year 1948, in which bloody events took place between the citizens demanding independence and the Spanish colonialism, in which a student of the Institute was killed by colonial agents, was a milestone in the history of the Institute. The Spanish administration began to confiscate the institute. All the staff were arrested and imprisoned in [[Ceuta]]. However, weeks later historian [[Tuhami al-Wazzani]], who was then the director of the elementary school joined the institute and asked the college students to help teach the younger ones so that the institute would not stop teaching altogether. Since then, secondary education has ceased and has been limited to primary education up to this day.&lt;ref name="presstetouan.com"/&gt; Many graduates continued their higher education in Spain, [[Cairo]] and [[Baghdad]].

===Other schools and institutions of higher education===
Tétouan is home for ''l'Institut National des Beaux-Arts'' (National Institute of Fine Art), the only national arts institution of higher education in Morocco. It was founded in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://universes.art/en/nafas/articles/2013/inba-tetouan/|title=Institut National des Beaux-Arts Tétouan -  When spontaneity and experimentation become forms|last=Saliou|first=Bérénice|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its promoter and first director was the Spanish [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] painter [[:es:Mariano Bertuchi|Mariano Bertuchi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56535119|title=Atlas of world art|date=2004|pages=291|publisher=Laurence King Pub|others=Onians, John, 1942-|isbn=1856693775|location=London|oclc=56535119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city hosts also ''Ecole Nationale d'Architecture'', which is one of the public architecture schools in the country.

Tétouan's public [[Abdelmalek Essaâdi University]] was founded in 1993. 16th century Moroccan Sultan [[Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik I Saadi]] is the university's namesake. The university has a student body of 86,000, one of the largest in Morocco. The Faculty of Theology ([[Arabic]] : كلية أصول الدين) was established in 1963 and was an affiliate of the prestigious [[University of Al Quaraouiyine|Al Quaraouiyine University]] in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] until 2015 when it was annexed to Abdelmalek Essaâdi University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fod.ac.ma/ar/%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%B0%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9|title=نبذة عن الكلية {{!}} كلية أصول الدين بتطوان|website=www.fod.ac.ma|language=ar|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some Spanish international schools operated by that country's [[Spanish Ministry of Education|Ministry of Education]]:

* Colegio Español Jacinto Benavente
* [[Instituto Español Juan de la Cierva]]
* [[Instituto Español Nuestra Señora del Pilar]]

===Foreign cultural centers===
Several foreign cultural centers are located in Tétouan :

* Spanish [[Instituto Cervantes]]
* French [[Institut Français]]
* American Language Center

== Economy and infrastructure ==
[[Image:Coche_unificado_de_3º_Clase_del_Ferrocarril_Ceuta-Tetuán.JPG|thumb|right|300x300px|Carriage of the 3rd Class of the Ceuta-Tetuán Railway, circa 1930|alt=]]
The economy of the city is based mainly on tourism and commerce. Other sectors of income include fishing and agriculture. Tétouan's civil airport [[Sania Ramel Airport]], which was originally a military airfield built by the Spanish army in 1913 before starting civilian operations in 1927, is operated by the [[Moroccan Airports Authority]] and is located 6&amp;nbsp;km (4&amp;nbsp;mi) to the east.

[[Image:M%27diq_from_above.jpg|thumb|right|300x300px|[[M'diq]] harbour - Fishing and leisure port at Tamuda bay |alt=]]
The [[:es:Línea de ferrocarril Ceuta-Tetuán|Ceuta-Tetuán railway line]], was the first Spanish international railway line that would unite the cities of Ceuta and Tétouan. It was inaugurated on March 17, 1918 by [[Prince Carlos of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Carlos de Borbón]] and [[:es:Mohammed Mehedi Uld Ben Ismael|Jalifa Mohammed Mehedi Uld Ben Ismael]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spanishrailway.com/2012/03/23/ferrocarril-de-ceuta-a-tetuan-protectorado-occidental-de-marruecos/|title=Spanish Railway  » Blog Archive   » Ferrocarril de Ceuta a Tetuán Protectorado Occidental de Marruecos|website=www.spanishrailway.com|language=es-ES|access-date=2018-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line is no longer in use. Tétouan is linked to [[Tangier]], [[Larache]], [[Chefchaouen]], Bab Sebta (border with Ceuta) and [[Al Hoceima]] via modern national motorways. The 28&amp;nbsp;km [[Tetouan–Fnideq expressway]] was completed in 2005.

The costal area is a major tourist destination during the summer period. It stretches from [[Fnideq]], a small city near [[Ceuta]] to the beaches of the small village [[El Jebha]] on the route to [[Al Hoceima]]. Several [[marina]]s and beach resorts are spread between different villages along the coast. The [[M'diq]] port is the main fishing port serving the city. M'diq has another port dedicated to leisure. Both have been expanded recently in order to improve tourist offerings and to increase the harbour's capacity. Boats up to 50 metres long with a depth of nearly five metres can be moored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.argolis-yacht.ru/School/Western_Mediterranean-2008/5.htm|title=Contents|last=Синицын|first=Александр|website=www.argolis-yacht.ru|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural tourism has also been developed during recent years. Many historical sites and monuments are found within and outside the old city (medina).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/855045724|title=The medina : restoration &amp; conservation of historic Islamic cities|last=1946-|first=Balbo, Marcello,|date=2012|publisher=I.B. Tauris|isbn=9781848857131|oclc=855045724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th century, Tétouan had a few flourishing industries such as [[Paper mill|paper manufacturing]] which was led by the ''Papelera de Tetuán'' company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/888932906331|title=Latin American export and import volumes and prices|pages=208|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was later merged with its competitor ''Cellulose du Maroc'' having its operations stopped in Tétouan and its headquarters transferred to [[Casablanca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/943709613|title=Morocco, 2011.|date=2010|publisher=Oxford Business Group|isbn=190706530X|location=[Place of publication not identified]|pages=68|oclc=943709613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Skoundo'' water distribution system ===
The historic center is equipped with an ingenious subterranean piping system for water distribution through its streets. In fact, until the early 1970's, drinking water supply in the old medina was mainly provided through this traditional network called "Skoundo" (El Abdellaoui, 1986).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/490592558|title=La Médina de Tétouan et son évolution récente étude de géographie urbaine|last=Mohamed.|first=El Abdellaoui,|date=1986|publisher=[s.n.]|oclc=490592558}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed around the 16th century in parallel with the construction of the first houses during its renewal by Andalusian refugees. It penetrates the ancient city from the far north to the far south. It starts at the top of Mount Dersa and extends underground under channels and pipes made of clay. Although it is not the only ancient water system in Morocco, others were found in [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] and [[Chefchaouen]], it remains the only one still operating. However, the bad state of the clay pipes added to neglect and other technical issues makes the water undrinkable although some restorations are underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medcities.org/documents/10180/384471/Round+Table+3_Tetouan.pdf/fe06700d-7a01-4cb7-b4cc-e0fca2c1093e|title=Programme de mise à niveau de ville de Tétouan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skoundo had a clear impact on various socio-economic charts of the city. The system did not only serve houses but also mosques, public toilets, hammams, tanneries and public mural fountains found in each neighborhood in the old medina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vqronline.org/essay/blind-plumber-tetouan|title=The Blind Plumber of Tetouan {{!}} VQR Online|website=www.vqronline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contraband controversies ===
Since a few decades, and because of the proximity of the city to the Spanish enclave [[Ceuta]], many people have been relying on [[contraband]] activities. Residents of Tétouan do not need a Visa permit to enter Ceuta. Before 1990's, no passport was needed and a Moroccan ID card was sufficient. In recent years the border has known many incidents such as stampedes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.efe.com/efe/english/portada/stampede-on-the-border-between-spain-s-ceuta-morocco-kills-2-women/50000260-3492294|title=Stampede on the border between Spain's Ceuta, Morocco kills 2 women|work=www.efe.com|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in some occasions because of the treatment by both Moroccan and Spanish border patrols. Human rights groups have often criticized the situation in which women carry heavy loads of goods - which gave them the epithet of "Mule women"-&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defenddemocracy.press/mule-women-morocco/|title=The ‘Mule Women’ of Morocco {{!}} Defend Democracy Press|last=Press|first=Defend Democracy|website=www.defenddemocracy.press|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; before cases of investigation were opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E-2016-009698+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&amp;amp;language=en|title=Written question - Illegal trade and human rights violations on the Ceuta border   - E-009698/2016|website=www.europarl.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2018/07/250497/morocco-investigation-human-mules-ceuta/|title=Morocco Opens Investigation into Situation of ‘Human Mules’ at Ceuta Crossing Points|date=2018-07-13|work=Morocco World News|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
{{Main|Moghreb Tétouan}}
In 1917, [[Tetouan]] saw the appearance of its first clubs of [[association football|football]], "Sporting of Tetuán" and "el Hispano-Marroquí" ("The Spanish-Moroccan"). One year later these two club, and a third one called "el Radio", merged and that gave the birth to the "Athletic Club Tetuán". The new club was established in 1922 by Basque [[Atlético Madrid]] fans who lived in Tétouan. In the early days it was known as Athletic Club Tetuan—based on the Spanish spelling of the city.  but after the [[Spanish Civil War]] and according to [[Francisco Franco|General Franco]]'s demands (banning non-Spanish names) as Club Atlético Tetuan. That is why the team has always played in red and white stripes and blue shorts, just like the big brothers from Madrid they were supposed to emulate. Under [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish Protectorate of Northern Morocco]], Tetuán were a part of [[La Liga|Spanish Liga]] for 33 years until independence was achieved in 1956. The highlight of that era was their surprising win of [[Segunda División|Spanish Segunda División]] (the southern group) in the 1950–51 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/span2champ.html Spain&amp;nbsp;– List of Second Division Champions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and promotion to the Primera Division of [[La Liga 1951-52|1951–52]], and the club remain, to this very day, the only African team ever to play in a top division in Europe.

Today, the city has one professional football club, [[Moghreb Athletic Tétouan]], which competes in the [[Botola]], the top-tier of Moroccan football. The team plays their home games at The [[Saniat Rmel]] stadium, the oldest football stadium in Africa. As of the 2018-19 season, the team will play at the new Tétouan Stadium, which will have a sitting capacity of more than 41,000. [[Moghreb Athletic Tétouan]] has won its first league title in the 20011–12 [[Botola]] League season, becoming the first Chamali club to ever win the league title. Today MAT is considered one of the five biggest football clubs in Morocco along with Raja Casablanca, Wydad Casablanca, FAR Rabat, and Maghreb Fès. The new football stadium in Mediterranean city of Tetouan will be built across 36 hectares north of the residential areas, along newly built A6 highway. It will occupy former farmlands and become the central sports arena of the agglomeration, replacing severely dated Stade Saniat Rmel. The Grand Shade De Tetouan is currently under construction it is scheduled to be open by late 2018.

== Geography ==
The city is situated about 60&amp;nbsp;km east of the city of [[Tangier]] and 40&amp;nbsp;km south of the Spanish [[exclave]] of [[Ceuta]] (Sebta) and the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. It is in the far north of the [[Rif Mountains]]. To the south and west of the city there are mountains. Tetuan is situated in the middle of a belt of [[orchard]]s that contain [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[almond]], [[pomegranate]] and [[Mediterranean Cypress|cypress]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;trees. The [[Rif Mountains]] are nearby, as the city is located in the [[Martil Valley]]. It is picturesquely situated on the northern slope of a fertile valley down which flows the Martil river, with the harbour of Tétouan, [[Martil]], at its mouth. Behind rise rugged masses of rock, the southern wall of the Anjera country, once practically closed to Europeans, and across the valley are the hills which form the northern limit of the still more impenetrable [[Rif]].

==Climate==
Tétouan features a [[Mediterranean climate]] with [[Köppen climate classification]] of ''Csa''. Located along the Mediterranean Sea, the weather in Tétouan is mild and rainy during the winter, hot and dry in the summer months.

==Sights in and around Tétouan==
[[Image:Zerka_in_Tetouan_Province.jpg|thumb|right|300x300px|Zerka natural spot in Mount Ghorghiz - [[Rif|Rif Mountains]].|alt=]]
* The [[Medina quarter|medina]] (old town) of Tétouan is on the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]] of the [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id_site=837 ''Medina of Tétouan''] - unesco.org&lt;/ref&gt; The inner city is very characteristic and traditional. One can find many white houses there, especially low houses. Everywhere in the city there are people performing their craftsmanship, like weavers, jewellers, leather workers. Street sellers often try to sell carpets to tourists as well. Tétouan is part of the [[Creative Cities Network|UNESCO Creative Cities Network]] and was named "City of Crafts and Folk Art" in 2017.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;
* The Archaeological Museum is located in city center a hundred meters away from the Royal Palace. The museum exhibits artifacts from different periods belonging to indigenous, Phoenician, Roman, Jewish and Arab cultures. The museum was constructed in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.morocco.com/museums/archaeological-museum-tetouan/|title=Archaeological Museum, Tetouan {{!}} By Morocco Channel|website=www.morocco.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Museum of Modern Art is located in front of Riad Al Ochak garden.
* The [[Mechouar]] of the Royal Palace is situated just outside and by one of the entrances to the old medina. There is a public square in front of it.
* Riad Al Ochak (literally meaning "Lovers' Garden"), officially known as Moulay Rachid's Garden, is a public garden designed after the moorish style. It is located at the bottom of the hills on the road down to the [[Martil Valley]].
* The [[Kasbah]] in the top of Mount Dersa where the ruins of the former barracks de [[Regulares]] are located alongside a cemetery of indigenous martyrs. 
* Tétouan enjoys a large coastline that spans from the border with [[Ceuta]] to the road to [[Al Hoceima]]. It is usually very busy in summer time and hosts many international clubs, hotels, golf resorts and marinas such as [[Club Med]], [[Sofitel]] and [[The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company|Ritz-Carlton]] located in Tamuda Bay area between [[M'diq]] and [[Fnideq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/hotels/morocco/tamuda-bay|title=Luxury Hotels &amp; Resorts {{!}} The Ritz-Carlton|website=The Ritz-Carlton|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest beach is the popular city of [[Martil]]. Other villages include [[Cabo Negro]], [[Oued Laou|Oued Lao]], [[El Jebha]].
* Tétouan is surrounded by two mounts -Dersa and Ghorghiz. Several natural spots are available and hiking activities are popular.

A '''visionary environment''' or '''fantasy world''' is an extensive/large-scale artistic installations (buildings, sculpture parks, etc.) intended to capture intense subjective/personal experiences (dreams, fantasies, obsessions, etc.) of their creators. The subjective/personal nature of these projects often implies a marginal status for the artists involved, and there is a strong association between visionary environments and [[outsider art]].

'''''What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell''''' is a 1944 science book written for the lay reader by physicist [[Erwin Schrödinger]].  The book was based on a course of public lectures delivered by Schrödinger in February 1943, under the auspices of the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] at [[Trinity College, Dublin]].  The lectures attracted an audience of about 400, who were warned "that the subject-matter was a difficult one and that the lectures could not be termed popular, even though the physicist’s most dreaded weapon, mathematical deduction, would hardly be utilized."&lt;ref name="Margulis"&gt;[[Lynn Margulis|Margulis, Lynn]]. &amp; Sagan, Dorion. (1995). ''What Is Life?'' (pg. 1). Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Schrödinger's lecture focused on one important question: "how can the events in space and time which take place within the spatial boundary of a living organism be accounted for by physics and chemistry?"&lt;ref name="Margulis"/&gt;

In the book, Schrödinger introduced the idea of an "aperiodic crystal" that contained genetic information in its configuration of covalent [[chemical bond]]s. In the 1950s, this idea stimulated enthusiasm for discovering the genetic molecule.  Although the existence of some form of hereditary information had been hypothesized since 1869, its role in reproduction and its helical shape were still unknown at the time of Schrödinger's lecture.  In retrospect, Schrödinger's aperiodic crystal can be viewed as a well-reasoned theoretical prediction of what biologists should have been looking for during their search for [[genetic material]]. Both [[James D. Watson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|authorlink=James D. Watson |first=James D. |last=Watson|year=2007 |title=Avoid Boring People: (Lessons from a life in science) |isbn=978-0-375-41284-4 |page=353|location=New York|publisher=Knopf}}. Page 28 details how Watson came to appreciate the significance of the gene.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Francis Crick]], who jointly proposed the [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]] structure of [[DNA]] based on [[X-ray diffraction]] experiments by [[Rosalind Franklin]], credited Schrödinger's book with presenting an early theoretical description of how the storage of [[Genetics|genetic]] information would work, and each independently acknowledged the book as a source of inspiration for their initial researches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.human-nature.com/nibbs/04/erwin.html|title=Book Review: ''What Is Life?'' By Erwin Schrödinger|author=Julian F. Derry|publisher=Human Nature Review|year=2004|accessdate=2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The book is based on lectures delivered under the auspices of the Institute at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], in February 1943 and published in 1944. At that time DNA was not yet accepted as the carrier of hereditary information, which only was the case after the [[Hershey–Chase experiment]] of 1952.  One of the most successful branches of physics at this time was [[statistical physics]], and [[quantum mechanics]], a theory which is also very statistical in its nature. Schrödinger himself is one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics.

[[Max Delbrück|Max Delbrück's]] thinking about the physical basis of life was an important influence on Schrödinger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dronamraju KR |title=Erwin Schrödinger and the origins of molecular biology |journal=Genetics |volume=153 |issue=3 |pages=1071–6 |date=November 1999 |pmid=10545442 |pmc=1460808 |url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/153/3/1071#Delbrucks_model}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, long before the publication of ''What is Life?'', geneticist and 1946 Nobel-prize winner [[H. J. Muller]] had in his 1922 article "Variation due to Change in the Individual Gene"&lt;ref&gt;American Naturalist 56 (1922)&lt;/ref&gt; already laid out all the basic properties of the "heredity molecule" (then not yet known to be DNA) that Schrödinger was to re-derive in 1944 "from first principles" in ''What is Life?'' (including the "aperiodicity" of the molecule), properties which Muller specified and refined additionally in his 1929 article "The Gene As The Basis of Life"&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the International Congress of Plant Sciences 1 (1929)&lt;/ref&gt; and during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Pursuit of the Gene. From Darwin to DNA |first=James |last=Schwartz |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-674-02670-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, [[H. J. Muller]] himself wrote in a 1960 letter to a journalist regarding ''What Is Life?'' that whatever the book got right about the "hereditary molecule" had already been published before 1944 and that Schrödinger's were only the wrong speculations; Muller also named two famous geneticists (including Delbrück) who knew every relevant pre-1944 publication and had been in contact with Schrödinger before 1944. But DNA as the molecule of heredity became topical only after [[Oswald Avery]]'s most important bacterial-transformation experiments in 1944. Before these experiments, proteins were considered the most likely candidates.

== Content ==

In chapter I, Schrödinger explains that most physical laws on a large scale are due to chaos on a small scale. He calls this principle "order-from-disorder." As an example he mentions [[diffusion]], which can be modeled as a highly ordered process, but which is caused by random movement of atoms or molecules. If the number of atoms is reduced, the behaviour of a system becomes more and more random. He states that life greatly depends on order and that a naïve physicist may assume that the master code of a living organism has to consist of a large number of atoms.

In chapter II and III, he summarizes what was known at this time about the hereditary mechanism. Most importantly, he elaborates the important role [[mutation]]s play in [[evolution]]. He concludes that the carrier of hereditary information has to be both small in size and permanent in time, contradicting the naïve physicist's expectation. This contradiction cannot be resolved by [[classical physics]].

In chapter IV, Schrödinger presents [[molecule]]s, which are indeed stable even if they consist of only a few atoms, as the solution. Even though molecules were known before, their stability could not be explained by classical physics, but is due to the discrete nature of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, [[mutation]]s are directly linked to [[Atomic electron transition|quantum leaps]].

He continues to explain, in chapter V, that true [[solid]]s, which are also permanent, are [[crystal]]s. The stability of molecules and crystals is due to the same principles and a molecule might be called "the germ of a solid." On the other hand, an [[amorphous]] solid, without crystalline structure, should be regarded as a [[liquid]] with a very high [[viscosity]]. Schrödinger believes the heredity material to be a molecule, which unlike a crystal does not repeat itself. He calls this an aperiodic crystal. Its aperiodic nature allows it to encode an almost infinite number of possibilities with a small number of atoms. He finally compares this picture with the known facts and finds it in accordance with them.

In chapter VI Schrödinger states:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ...living matter, while not eluding the "laws of physics" as established up to date, is likely to involve "other laws of physics" hitherto unknown, which however, once they have been revealed, will form just as integral a part of science as the former.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He knows that this statement is open to misconception and tries to clarify it. The main principle involved with "order-from-disorder" is the [[second law of thermodynamics]], according to which [[entropy]] only increases in a closed system (such as the universe). Schrödinger explains that living matter evades the decay to [[thermodynamical equilibrium]] by homeostatically maintaining [[negative entropy]] (today this quantity is called [[information]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|authorlink1=Claude Shannon|last1=Shannon|first1=Claude |authorlink2=Warren Weaver|last2=Weaver|first2=Warren|title=The Mathematical Theory of Communication|year=1949|isbn=0-252-72546-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in an open system.

In chapter VII, he maintains that "order-from-order" is not absolutely new to physics; in fact, it is even simpler and more plausible. But nature follows "order-from-disorder", with some exceptions as the movement of the [[celestial bodies]] and the behaviour of mechanical devices such as clocks. But even those are influenced by thermal and frictional forces. The degree to which a system functions mechanically or statistically depends on the temperature. If heated, a clock ceases to function, because it melts. Conversely, if the temperature approaches [[absolute zero]], any system behaves more and more mechanically. Some systems approach this mechanical behaviour rather fast with room temperature already being practically equivalent to absolute zero.

Schrödinger concludes this chapter and the book with [[philosophy|philosophical]] speculations on [[determinism]], [[free will]], and the mystery of human [[consciousness]]. He attempts to "see whether we cannot draw the correct non-contradictory conclusion from the following two premises: (1) My body functions as a pure mechanism according to Laws of Nature; and (2) Yet I know, by incontrovertible direct experience, that I am directing its motions, of which I foresee the effects, that may be fateful and all-important, in which case I feel and take full responsibility for them. The only possible inference from these two facts is, I think, that I – I in the widest meaning of the word, that is to say, every conscious mind that has ever said or felt 'I' – am the person, if any, who controls the 'motion of the atoms' according to the Laws of Nature". Schrödinger then states that this insight is not new and that Upanishads considered this insight of "ATHMAN&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;BRAHMAN" to "represent quintessence of deepest insights into the happenings of the world. Schrödinger rejects the idea that the source of consciousness should perish with the body because he finds the idea "distasteful". He also rejects the idea that there are multiple immortal souls that can exist without the body because he believes that consciousness is nevertheless highly dependent on the body. Schrödinger writes that, to reconcile the two premises,&lt;blockquote&gt;The only possible alternative is simply to keep to the immediate experience that consciousness is a singular of which the plural is unknown; that there is only one thing and that what seems to be a plurality is merely a series of different aspects of this one thing…&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Any intuitions that consciousness is plural, he says, are illusions. Schrödinger is sympathetic to the [[Hindu]] concept of [[Brahman]], by which each individual's consciousness is only a manifestation of a [[collective consciousness|unitary consciousness]] pervading the [[universe]] — which corresponds to the Hindu concept of God. Schrödinger concludes that "...'I' am the person, if any, who controls the 'motion of the atoms' according to the Laws of Nature." However, he also qualifies the conclusion as "necessarily subjective" in its "philosophical implications". In the final paragraph, he points out that what is meant by "I" is not the collection of experienced events but "namely the canvas upon which they are collected." If a hypnotist succeeds in blotting out all earlier reminiscences, he writes, there would be no loss of personal existence — "Nor will there ever be."&lt;ref&gt;Schrödinger references ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]] as a "beautiful book" leveling with the view he has taken in the last chapter.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Schrödinger's "paradox" ==

In a world governed by the [[second law of thermodynamics]], all [[isolated system]]s are expected to approach a state of maximum disorder. Since life approaches and maintains a highly ordered state, some argue that this seems to violate the aforementioned second law, implying that there is a paradox. However, since the [[biosphere]] is not an isolated system, there is no paradox. The increase of order inside an organism is more than paid for by an increase in disorder outside this organism by the loss of heat into the environment. By this mechanism, the second law is obeyed, and life maintains a highly ordered state, which it sustains by causing a net increase in disorder in the Universe. In order to increase the complexity on Earth—as life does—[[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] is needed and in this case is provided by the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;''What is Life?'' p.&amp;nbsp;91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'' Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Willard Van Orman Quine''' ({{IPAc-en|k|w|aɪ|n}}; known to intimates as "Van";&lt;ref name=mactutor&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Quine|date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; June 25, 1908 – December 25, 2000) was an [[American philosopher]]  and [[logician]] in the [[analytic philosophy|analytic tradition]], recognized as "one of the most influential philosophers of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/29/arts/29QUIN.html "W. V. Quine, Philosopher Who Analyzed Language and Reality, Dies at 92"]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1930 until his death 70 years later, Quine was continually affiliated with [[Harvard University]] in one way or another, first as a student, then as a professor of philosophy and a teacher of logic and [[set theory]], and finally as a professor emeritus who published or revised several books in retirement. He filled the Edgar Pierce Chair of Philosophy at Harvard from 1956 to 1978. A 2009 poll conducted among analytic philosophers named Quine as the fifth most important philosopher of the past two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2009/03/so-who-is-the-most-important-philosopher-of-the-past-200-years.html "So who *is* the most important philosopher of the past 200 years?"] Leiter Reports.

Quine falls squarely into the analytic philosophy tradition while also being the main proponent of the view that philosophy is not [[conceptual analysis]] but the abstract branch of the empirical sciences.  His major writings include "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]" (1951), which attacked the distinction between [[analytic proposition|analytic]] and [[synthetic proposition|synthetic]] [[proposition]]s and advocated a form of [[semantic holism]], and ''[[Word and Object]]'' (1960), which further developed these positions and introduced Quine's famous [[indeterminacy of translation]] thesis, advocating a [[behaviorist]] [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|theory of meaning]]. He also developed an influential [[naturalized epistemology]] that tried to provide "an improved scientific explanation of how we have developed elaborate scientific theories on the basis of meager sensory input."&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/quine-sc/ "Quine's Philosophy of Science"]. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Iep.utm.edu. July 27, 2009. Accessed March 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also important in [[philosophy of science]] for his "systematic attempt to understand science from within the resources of science itself"&lt;ref name="iep" /&gt; and for his conception of philosophy as continuous with science. This led to his famous quip that "philosophy of science is philosophy enough."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2251091?cookieSet=1 "Mr Strawson on Logical Theory"]. WV Quine. ''Mind'' Vol. 62 No. 248. Oct. 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[philosophy of mathematics]], he and his Harvard colleague [[Hilary Putnam]] developed the "[[Philosophy of mathematics#Indispensability argument for realism|Quine–Putnam indispensability thesis]]," an argument for the [[Philosophy of mathematics#Empiricism|reality of mathematical entities]].&lt;ref&gt;Colyvan, Mark, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2004/entries/mathphil-indis/ "Indispensability Arguments in the Philosophy of Mathematics"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2004 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
According to his autobiography, ''The Time of My Life'' (1986), Quine grew up in [[Akron, Ohio]], where he lived with his parents and older brother Robert Cloyd. His father, Cloyd Robert,&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Companion to Quine, ed. Roger F. Gibson, Jr, Cambridge University Press, 2004, pg 1&lt;/ref&gt; was a manufacturing entrepreneur (founder of the Akron Equipment Company, which produced tire molds)&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Companion to Quine, ed. Roger F. Gibson, Jr, Cambridge University Press, 2004, pg 1&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother, Harriett E., was a schoolteacher and later a housewife.&lt;ref name=mactutor /&gt; He received his B.A. in mathematics from [[Oberlin College]] in 1930, and his Ph.D. in philosophy from [[Harvard University]] in 1932. His thesis supervisor was [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. He was then appointed a [[Harvard Junior Fellow]], which excused him from having to teach for four years. During the academic year 1932–33, he travelled in Europe thanks to a Sheldon fellowship, meeting Polish logicians (including [[Stanislaw Lesniewski]] and [[Alfred Tarski]]) and members of the [[Vienna Circle]] (including [[Rudolf Carnap]]), as well as the [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] [[A. J. Ayer]].&lt;ref name=mactutor /&gt;

It was Quine who arranged for Tarski to be invited to the September 1939 [[Unity of Science]] Congress in Cambridge, for which Tarski sailed on the last ship to leave [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] before the [[Third Reich]] invaded Poland. Tarski survived the war and worked another 44 years in the US.

During World War II, Quine lectured on logic in Brazil, in Portuguese, and served in the United States Navy in a [[military intelligence]] role, deciphering messages from German submarines, and reaching the rank of lieutenant commander.&lt;ref name=mactutor /&gt;

At Harvard, Quine helped supervise the Harvard [[graduate theses]] of, among others, [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Gilbert Harman]], [[Dagfinn Føllesdal]], [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]], [[Hugues LeBlanc]],  [[Henry Hiz]] and [[George Myro]]. For the academic year 1964–1965, Quine was a fellow on the faculty in the Center for Advanced Studies at [[Wesleyan University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/ce1000-137.html "Guide to the Center for Advanced Studies Records, 1958–1969"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314083709/http://www.wesleyan.edu/libr/schome/FAs/ce1000-137.html |date=March 14, 2017 }}. Weselyan University. Wesleyan.edu. Accessed March 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980
Quine received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Faculty of Humanities at [[Uppsala University]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/&lt;/ref&gt;

Quine was an atheist when he was a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of W.V. Quine|year=1986|publisher=Open Court|isbn=9780812690101|page=6|last1=Quine |first1=Willard Van Orman |last2=Hahn |first2=Lewis Edwin |quote=In my third year of high school I walked often with my new Jamaican friends, Fred and Harold Cassidy, trying to convert them from their Episcopalian faith to atheism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had four children by two marriages.&lt;ref name=mactutor /&gt; Guitarist [[Robert Quine]] was his nephew.

In the foreword to the new edition of ''Word and Object'', Quine's student Dagfinn Føllesdal noted that Quine began to lose his memory toward the end of his life. The deterioration of his short-term memory was so severe that he struggled to continue following arguments. Quine also had considerable difficulty in his project to make the desired revisions to ''Word and Object.'' Before passing away, Quine noted to Morton White, "I do not remember what my illness is called, Althusser or Alzheimer, but since I cannot remember it, it must be Alzheimer." He passed away from the illness on Christmas Day in 2000.&lt;ref&gt; W.V. Quine. ''Word and Object'' 2013. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political beliefs===
Quine was politically conservative, but the bulk of his writing was in technical areas of philosophy removed from direct political issues.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', [http://www.wvquine.org/wvq-obit3.html obituary] for W V Quine – January 4, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, write in defense of several conservative positions: for example, in ''Quiddities: An Intermittently Philosophical Dictionary'', he wrote a defense of [[moral censorship]];&lt;ref&gt;''Quiddities: An Intermittently Philosophical Dictionary'', entry for Tolerance (pp. 206–8)&lt;/ref&gt; while, in his autobiography, he made some criticisms of American postwar academic culture.&lt;ref&gt;"Paradoxes of Plenty" in ''Theories and Things'', p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Time of My Life: An Autobiography'', pp. 352–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Quine's Ph.D. thesis and early publications were on [[formal logic]] and [[set theory]]. Only after World War II did he, by virtue of seminal papers on [[ontology]], [[epistemology]] and language, emerge as a major philosopher. By the 1960s, he had worked out his "naturalized epistemology" whose aim was to answer all substantive questions of knowledge and meaning using the methods and tools of the natural sciences. Quine roundly rejected the notion that there should be a "first philosophy", a theoretical standpoint somehow prior to natural science and capable of justifying it. These views are intrinsic to his [[philosophical naturalism|naturalism]].

Quine could lecture in French, Spanish, Portuguese and German, as well as his native English.

Like the logical positivists, Quine evinced little interest in the philosophical canon: only once did he teach a course in the history of philosophy, on Hume.{{Clarify|reason=These words mean nothing to non-experts: 'logical positivist', 'philosophical canon', and 'Hume.'  What is this sentence trying to tell me?|date=October 2014}}

===Rejection of the analytic–synthetic distinction===
{{See also|Two Dogmas of Empiricism#Analyticity and circularity|l1=Two Dogmas of Empiricism}}
In the 1930s and 40s, discussions with [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Nelson Goodman]] and [[Alfred Tarski]], among others, led Quine to doubt the tenability of the distinction between "analytic" statements—those true simply by the meanings of their words, such as "All bachelors are unmarried"—and "synthetic" statements, those true or false by virtue of facts about the world, such as "There is a cat on the mat." This distinction was central to [[logical positivism]]. Although Quine is not normally associated with [[verificationism]], some philosophers believe the tenet is not incompatible with his general philosophy of language, citing his Harvard colleague [[B. F. Skinner]] and his analysis of language in ''[[Verbal Behavior (book)|Verbal Behavior]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Prawitz, Dag. 'Quine and Verificationism.' In ''Inquiry'', Stockholm, 1994, pp 487–494&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other [[Analytic philosophy|Analytic]] philosophers before him, Quine accepted the [[definition]] of "analytic" as "true in virtue of meaning alone". Unlike them, however, he concluded that ultimately the definition was [[circular definition|circular]]. In other words, Quine accepted that analytic statements are those that are true by definition, then argued that the notion of truth by definition was unsatisfactory. 

Quine's chief objection to analyticity is with the notion of [[synonymy]] (sameness of meaning), a sentence being analytic, just in case it substitutes a synonym for one "black" in a proposition like "All black things are black" (or any other [[logical truth]]). The objection to synonymy hinges upon the problem of collateral information. We intuitively feel that there is a distinction between "All unmarried men are bachelors" and "There have been black dogs", but a competent English speaker will assent to both sentences under all conditions since such speakers also have access to ''collateral information'' bearing on the historical existence of black dogs. Quine maintains that there is no distinction between universally known collateral information and conceptual or analytic truths.

Another approach to Quine's objection to analyticity and synonymy emerges from the modal notion of [[logical possibility]]. A traditional [[Wittgenstein]]ian view of meaning held that each meaningful sentence was associated with a region in the space of possible worlds.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Quine finds the notion of such a space problematic, arguing that there is no distinction between those truths which are universally and confidently believed and those which are necessarily true.

===Confirmation holism and ontological relativity===
The central theses underlying the [[indeterminacy of translation]] and other extensions of Quine's work are [[ontological relativity]] and the related [[doctrine]] of [[confirmation holism]]. The premise of confirmation [[holism]] is that all theories (and the propositions derived from them) are under-determined by empirical data (data, sensory-data, evidence); although some theories are not justifiable, failing to fit with the data or being unworkably complex, there are many equally justifiable alternatives. While the Greeks' assumption that (unobservable) Homeric gods exist is false, and our supposition of (unobservable) electromagnetic waves is true, both are to be justified solely by their ability to explain our observations.

Quine concluded his "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]" as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As an empiricist I continue to think of the conceptual scheme of science as a tool, ultimately, for predicting future experience in the light of past experience. Physical objects are conceptually imported into the situation as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of [[Homer]] . . . For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But in point of epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind. Both sorts of entities enter our conceptions only as cultural posits.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quine's ontological [[relativism]] (evident in the passage above) led him to agree with [[Pierre Duhem]] that for any collection of [[empirical evidence]], there would always be many theories able to account for it. However, Duhem's [[holism]] is much more restricted and limited than Quine's. For Duhem, underdetermination applies only to [[physics]] or possibly to [[natural science]], while for Quine it applies to all of human knowledge. Thus, while it is possible to verify or [[falsifiability|falsify]] whole theories, it is not possible to verify or falsify individual statements. Almost any particular statement can be saved, given sufficiently radical modifications of the containing theory. For Quine, scientific thought forms a [[Coherentism|coherent]] web in which any part could be altered in the light of empirical evidence, and in which no empirical evidence could force the revision of a given part.

===Existence and its contrary===
The [[Problem of empty names|problem of non-referring names]] is an old puzzle in philosophy, which Quine captured when he wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A curious thing about the ontological problem is its simplicity.  It can be put into three Anglo-Saxon monosyllables: 'What is there?'  It can be answered, moreover, in a word—'Everything'—and everyone will accept this answer as true.&lt;ref&gt;W. V. O. Quine, "[[On What There Is]]", ''The Review of Metaphysics'' '''2'''(5), 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More directly, the controversy goes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;How can we talk about [[Pegasus]]?  To what does the word 'Pegasus' refer?  If our answer is, 'Something,' then we seem to believe in mystical entities; if our answer is, 'nothing', then we seem to talk about nothing and what sense can be made of this?  Certainly when we said that Pegasus was a mythological winged horse we make sense, and moreover we speak the truth!  If we speak the truth, this must be truth ''about something''.  So we cannot be speaking of nothing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quine resists the temptation to say that non-referring terms are meaningless for reasons made clear above.  Instead he tells us that we must first determine whether our terms refer or not before we know the proper way to understand them.  However, [[Czesław Lejewski]] criticizes this belief for reducing the matter to empirical discovery when it seems we should have a formal distinction between referring and non-referring terms or elements of our domain.  Lejewski writes further,

&lt;blockquote&gt;This state of affairs does not seem to be very satisfactory.  The idea that some of our rules of inference should depend on empirical information, which may not be forthcoming, is so foreign to the character of logical inquiry that a thorough re-examination of the two inferences [existential generalization and universal instantiation] may prove worth our while.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lejewski then goes on to offer a description of [[free logic]], which he claims accommodates an answer to the problem.

Lejewski also points out that free logic additionally can handle the problem of the empty set for statements like &lt;math&gt;\forall x\,Fx \rightarrow \exists x\,Fx&lt;/math&gt;.  Quine had considered the problem of the empty set unrealistic, which left Lejewski unsatisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Czeslaw Lejewski, "Logic and Existence". ''British Journal for the Philosophy of Science'' Vol. 5 (1954–55), pp. 104–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logic===
Over the course of his career, Quine published numerous technical and expository papers on formal logic, some of which are reprinted in his ''Selected Logic Papers'' and in ''The Ways of Paradox''.

Quine confined logic to classical bivalent [[first-order logic]], hence to truth and falsity under any (nonempty) [[universe of discourse]]. Hence the following were not logic for Quine:
* Higher-order logic and set theory. He referred to [[higher-order logic]] as "set theory in disguise";
* Much of what ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' included in logic was not logic for Quine.
* Formal systems involving [[intension]]al notions, especially [[modal logic|modality]]. Quine was especially hostile to modal logic with [[Quantification (logic)|quantification]], a battle he largely lost when [[Saul Kripke]]'s [[Kripke semantics|relational semantics]] became canonical for [[modal logic]]s.

Quine wrote three undergraduate texts on formal logic:
* ''Elementary Logic''. While teaching an introductory course in 1940, Quine discovered that extant texts for philosophy students did not do justice to [[quantification theory]] or [[first-order predicate logic]]. Quine wrote this book in 6 weeks as an ''[[ad hoc]]'' solution to his teaching needs.
* ''Methods of Logic''. The four editions of this book resulted from a more advanced undergraduate course in logic Quine taught from the end of World War II until his 1978 retirement.
* ''Philosophy of Logic''. A concise and witty undergraduate treatment of a number of Quinian themes, such as the prevalence of use-mention confusions, the dubiousness of [[modal logic|quantified modal logic]], and the non-logical character of higher-order logic.

''Mathematical Logic'' is based on Quine's graduate teaching during the 1930s and '40s. It shows that much of what ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' took more than 1000 pages to say can be said in 250 pages. The proofs are concise, even cryptic. The last chapter, on [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] and [[Tarski's indefinability theorem]], along with the article Quine (1946), became a launching point for [[Raymond Smullyan]]'s later lucid exposition of these and related results.

Quine's work in logic gradually became dated in some respects. Techniques he did not teach and discuss include [[analytic tableau]]x, [[recursion#Functional recursion|recursive function]]s, and [[model theory]]. His treatment of [[metalogic]] left something to be desired. For example, ''Mathematical Logic'' does not include any proofs of [[soundness]] and [[completeness (logic)|completeness]]. Early in his career, the notation of his writings on logic was often idiosyncratic. His later writings nearly always employed the now-dated notation of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. Set against all this are the simplicity of his preferred method (as exposited in his ''Methods of Logic'') for determining the satisfiability of quantified formulas, the richness of his philosophical and linguistic insights, and the fine prose in which he expressed them.

Most of Quine's original work in formal logic from 1960 onwards was on variants of his [[predicate functor logic]], one of several ways that have been proposed for doing logic without [[Quantification (logic)|quantifier]]s. For a comprehensive treatment of predicate functor logic and its history, see Quine (1976). For an introduction, see chpt. 45 of his ''Methods of Logic''.

Quine was very warm to the possibility that formal logic would eventually be applied outside of philosophy and mathematics. He wrote several papers on the sort of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] employed in [[electrical engineering]], and with [[Edward J. McCluskey]], devised the [[Quine–McCluskey algorithm]] of reducing [[Boolean equation]]s to a minimum covering sum of [[prime implicant]]s.

===Set theory===
While his contributions to logic include elegant expositions and a number of technical results, it is in [[set theory]] that Quine was most innovative. He always maintained that mathematics required set theory and that set theory was quite distinct from logic. He flirted with [[Nelson Goodman]]'s [[nominalism]] for a while, but backed away when he failed to find a nominalist grounding of mathematics.

Over the course of his career, Quine proposed three variants of axiomatic set theory, each including the [[axiom of extensionality]]:
* [[New Foundations]], NF, creates and manipulates sets using a single axiom schema for set admissibility, namely an axiom schema of stratified comprehension, whereby all individuals satisfying a stratified formula compose a set. A stratified formula is one that [[type theory]] would allow, were the [[ontology]] to include types. However, Quine's set theory does not feature types. The metamathematics of NF are curious. NF allows many "large" sets the now-canonical [[ZFC]] set theory does not allow, even sets for which the [[axiom of choice]] does not hold. Since the axiom of choice holds for all finite sets, the failure of this axiom in NF proves that NF includes infinite sets. The consistency of NF relative to other formal systems adequate for mathematics is an open question, albeit that a number of candidate proofs are current in the NF community suggesting that NF is equiconsistent with [[Zermelo set theory]] without Choice. A modification of NF, [[New Foundations|NFU]], due to R. B. Jensen and admitting [[urelement]]s (entities that can be members of sets but that lack elements), turns out to be consistent relative to [[Peano arithmetic]], thus vindicating the intuition behind NF. NF and NFU are the only Quinean set theories with a following. For a derivation of foundational mathematics in NF, see Rosser (1952);
* The set theory of ''Mathematical Logic'' is NF augmented by the [[proper class]]es of [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], except axiomatized in a much simpler way;
* The set theory of ''Set Theory and Its Logic'' does away with stratification and is almost entirely derived from a single axiom schema. Quine derived the foundations of mathematics once again. This book includes the definitive exposition of Quine's theory of virtual sets and relations, and surveyed axiomatic set theory as it stood circa 1960. 

All three set theories admit a universal class, but since they are free of any [[hierarchy]] of [[Type (metaphysics)|types]], they have no need for a distinct universal class at each type level.

Quine's set theory and its background logic were driven by a desire to minimize posits; each innovation is pushed as far as it can be pushed before further innovations are introduced. For Quine, there is but one connective, the [[Sheffer stroke]], and one quantifier, the [[universal quantifier]]. All polyadic [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] can be reduced to one dyadic predicate, interpretable as set membership. His rules of proof were limited to [[modus ponens]] and substitution. He preferred [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] to either [[disjunction]] or the [[Material conditional|conditional]], because conjunction has the least semantic ambiguity. He was delighted to discover early in his career that all of first order logic and set theory could be grounded in a mere two primitive notions: [[set abstraction|abstraction]] and [[inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]]. For an elegant introduction to the parsimony of Quine's approach to logic, see his "New Foundations for Mathematical Logic," ch. 5 in his ''From a Logical Point of View''.

===Epistemology===
Just as he challenged the dominant analytic–synthetic distinction, Quine also took aim at traditional [[normative]] [[epistemology]].  According to Quine, traditional epistemology tried to justify the sciences, but this effort (as exemplified by [[Rudolf Carnap]]) failed, and so we should replace traditional epistemology with an empirical study of what sensory inputs produce what theoretical outputs:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-naturalized/#2|title=Naturalized Epistemology|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Epistemology, or something like it, simply falls into place as a chapter of psychology and hence of natural science. It studies a natural phenomenon, viz., a physical human subject. This human subject is accorded a certain experimentally controlled input — certain patterns of irradiation in assorted frequencies, for instance — and in the fullness of time the subject delivers as output a description of the three-dimensional external world and its history. The relation between the meager input and the torrential output is a relation that we are prompted to study for somewhat the same reasons that always prompted epistemology: namely, in order to see how evidence relates to theory, and in what ways one's theory of nature transcends any available evidence...But a conspicuous difference between old epistemology and the epistemological enterprise in this new psychological setting is that we can now make free use of empirical psychology." (Quine, 1969: 82–3)

Quine's proposal is controversial among contemporary philosophers and has several critics, with [[Jaegwon Kim]] the most prominent among them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epistemology-naturalized/ "Naturalized Epistemology"].

==In popular culture==
* A [[computer program]] whose output is its own source code is called a "[[Quine (computing)|quine]]" after Quine. This usage was introduced by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in his 1979 book, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]''.
* Quine is a recurring character in the webcomic "[[Existential Comics]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://existentialcomics.com/comic/36]. Existential Comics. Accessed November 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

* Quine was selected for inclusion in the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]'s "Pantheon of Skeptics," which celebrates contributors to the cause of [[scientific skepticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pantheon of Skeptics|url=http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|website=CSI|publisher=[[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]]|accessdate=April 30, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131054129/http://www.csicop.org/about/the_pantheon_of_skeptics|archivedate=January 31, 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3431">The '''Zutistes''' or the '''Circle of Poets Zutiques''' was an informal group of French poets, painters and musicians who met at the Hôtel des Étrangers, at the corner of rue Racine and rue de l'École-de -Medicine, in Paris from September to October 1871.

==Background==

The Zutistes were a fringe spin-off from a splinter group of [[Parnassianism|Parnassians]], known as the "Nasty Fellows" or "Villains Bonshommes",&lt;ref&gt;G Robb, ''Rimbaud'' (London 2001) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; who formed a Parisian dining club at the close of the 1860s. Without having a formal manifesto, and taking their name from the French exclamation of baffled exasperation, ''Zut'',&lt;ref&gt;G Robb, ''Rimbaud'' (London 2001) p. 129n&lt;/ref&gt; this informal gathering of artists known as the Zutistes gathered around the figure of the pianist [[Ernest Cabaner]], who worked as a bartender/piano player at the hotel.  Anarchic in spirit, they looked back regretfully to the atmosphere of the recently overthrown [[Paris Commune]].&lt;ref&gt;G Robb, ''Rimbaud'' (London 2001) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant figure in the circle was [[Charles Cros]], while other members were later better known, like [[Verlaine]] and [[Rimbaud]].

The most significant trace of the movement came with the re-discovery in the Thirties of the Zutique Album, with some 101 literary entries accompanied by (sometimes pornographic) drawings.&lt;ref&gt;J Austin, ''Proust, Pastiche and the Postmodern'' (2013) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Album==

Shot through with black humour, and riddled with parody and pastiche of contemporary styles and attitudes,&lt;ref&gt;J Austin, ''Proust, Pastiche and the Postmodern'' (2013) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; the album is the best guide to the Circle's membership of some fourteen names.

A central target of the Album's mockery was the recently successful Parnassian [[Francois Coppee]], while other more established figures like [[José-Maria de Heredia]] and [[Leconte de Lisle]] were also in the line of fire.&lt;ref&gt;J Austin, ''Proust, Pastiche and the Postmodern'' (2013) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

This album is in the form of an in-quarto Italian, black hardback cover, about thirty sheets handwritten, the other pages remained blank.

==Aftermath==
Nostalgia for the circle persisted among its members long after its break-up, perhaps as early as the winter of 1871–1872: thus for example the young Zutiste [[Raoul Ponchon]] was one of only seven recipients of Rimbaud's ''[[A Season in Hell]]'';&lt;ref&gt;G Robb, ''Rimbaud'' (London 2001) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Cros in 1883 used "zutique" to name  a new poetry circle; while (perhaps coincidentally) as late as in 1897 the claim would be made that "man is by nature essentially 'zutique'".&lt;ref&gt;Anon, quoted in S Whidden, ''Authority in Crisis in French Literature'' (2016) p 64&lt;/ref&gt;
